{"id": "1871814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871814", "title": "Culicoides imicola", "text": "Culicoides imicola\n\nCulicoides imicola (\"Culicoides imicola\" Kieffer, former name \"C. pallidipennis\" Carter) is a species of biting midges that transmits the bluetongue virus (BTV) and the African horse sickness virus. This particular species has been recorded in Africa, Asia and Europe. African midges feed on animal blood, including horse, cattle, and sheep. Unlike other species within the \"Culicoides genus,\" this species prefers drier habitats for egg laying but retains a preference for moist soil to support larvae growth. Other suspected BTV vectors are \"Culicoides\" (\"Culicoides\") \"pulicaris\" and species in the \"Culicoides\" (\"Avaritia\") \"obsoletus\" complex.\n\nThere are many species in the family, and it is difficult to physically distinguish between them. This has historically been a source of confusion in studies involving \"C. imicola\".\n\nMales are characterized by spicules on their genitalia, which has a normal average of 45 spicules. However, variation is significant, as their quantity has been recorded to range from 8 to 145 spicules. Spicules are needle-like projections from the genitalia.\n\nHistorically, \"Culicoides imicola\" has been found in Africa and southwestern Asia, but their distribution has been increasing, as human activity has catalyzed this spread. Because of the connection between cattle and \"C. imicola\", \"C.imicola\" can be found where cattle are densely populated. Coupled with irrigation in farms which provides damper more habitable soil, \"C.imicola\" population has been able to rise.\n\nUnlike other species of \"Culicoides\", \"C. imicola\" has been shown to prefer drier environments in multiple studies. A likely reason is that \"C. imicola\" pupa are especially prone to drowning, so their eggs are often laid in surfaces free of running water. However, the larvae need moist soil, so there tends to be a trade-off between dry and wet areas.\n\nIn a study done in Sicily, \"C. imicola\" do not inhabit undulating or high-altitude areas. They instead prefer lower altitude flattish regions at around 200 meters. This is because in steeply undulating topographic areas, rapid desiccation leads to drying of soil, which prevents proper larval development. Further examination has shown that the biggest determining factor in their distribution is not altitude but a suitable climate and nutritious soil.\n\n\"Culicoides bolitinos\", once thought to be the same species as \"C. imicola\", has now been recognized as a separate but closely related species. \nSome important taxonomic differences are: different margins in cell R5, different color and size of apex of vein M2, and different palp lengths, along with other sexual differences.\n\nThere are 4 main stages of development: egg, larvae, pupa, and imago. Eggs are laid in batches and darken quickly once laid.\n\nThe life cycle of \"C. imicola\" depends largely on the temperature at which pregnant females lay their eggs. In laboratory-tested flies, it was found that at 20 °C it takes up to 2 months to go from egg-laying to adulthood, up to 21 days at 25 °C, and up to 16 days at 28 °C. However, at higher temperatures there were fewer hatchings and higher variability in fecundity. It is also interesting to note that more males emerge from pupae than females, although the exact reasons are unknown. Some possible explanations are that the female larvae have higher mortality rates, or that the sex ratio is temperature dependent.\n\n\"C. imicola\", like most other biting midges, feed on animal blood. In Africa, \"C. imicola\" is known to feed on horse, cattle, and sheep. Nonetheless, their feeding preferences haven't been studied extensively in Europe but should be similar to those in Africa.\n\n\"Culicoides\" species vary significantly in their activities in different contexts. In a study done in Kenya, \"Culicoides imicola\" effectively ceases all activity at wind speeds above three meters per second. And, like most \"Culicoides\", \"Culicoides imicola\" is also known to be nocturnal and tend to be more active during cooler temperatures.\n\n\"C. imicola\" and humans usually do not interact directly, but they do so through their capabilities as disease vectors for many farm animals such as cows, horses, and sheep. Cattle drives have thus been identified as a man-made mechanism for the spread of infectious disease vectors, such as \"C. imicola\". These vectors rely on cattle dung, and their introduction into different areas has led to \"C. imicola\" and viral spread across the world.\n\n\"C. imicola\" is the main vector for BTV (bluetongue virus), with other \"Cullicoides\" species being secondary vectors. The periodic burst of \"C. imicola\" population has correlated with outbreaks of BTV, which often occur cyclically. As much as 90% of all BTV cases in the Mediterranean Basin has been linked to \"C. imicola\", which is possibly due to its dry and hot summers that allow rapid larval maturation, which in turn leads to multiple generations hatching within a single season.\n\n\"C. imicola\" is also known to be the only field vector for the African horse sickness (AHS). In the past, AHS has only occurred periodically, no more than two years at a time. However, there has been occasions where it has persisted for over 5 years. The year-round presence of \"C. imicola\" in the face of climate change has been identified as the possible source of longer durations of AHS.\n\nTraditionally, \"Culicoides imicola\" has been found in subtropical Asia and Africa. However, due to climate change, they have spread all the way to Europe and as far as Sweden. The increase in temperature has positively impacted \"C. imicola\" distribution, which has raised concern in the spread of disease across central Europe as the flies make their way northward.\n\nThe expansion of \"C. imicola\" out of its traditional Old World region of Africa and Asia may be a risk for significant spread orbivirus in the near future. Already, it is well distributed in Spain, Portugal, and several Greek islands; all of these area tend to be much warmer than their northern European counterparts. If temperatures continue to increase or stay roughly the same, the spread of these viral vectors will need to be properly prepared for and countered. Other species affecting Europe include \"C. obsoletus, C. pulicaris, C. nubeculosus\" and \"C. schultzei.\" \n\n\"C. imicola\" acclimated to different temperatures were found to have different survival capabilities in low temperatures but were about the same at high temperatures. Flies acclimated at 24 °C survived better at lower temperatures (-6 °C) while those at 29 °C did not get past -3 °C. However, there was no significant difference at higher temperature because once 42 °C was reached there was near total fatality. Due to the profound survival effect attributed to temperature, climate change altered the distribution and abundance of \"C. imicola.\"\n\nMuch is left to be understood about \"C. imicola\". Because of the many closely related species in the family, it is important to properly identify each individually as to prevent confounding different species together. Their thermal limits in larvae stages is also of interest, as that could further explain their distribution across the world. Additionally, because of the difficulty in laboratory conditions in matching field conditions, more research is needed to study how their life cycle plays out.\n"}

The company also manufactures and distributes Under Armour and New Balance brand socks. The company has approximately 42,000 employees worldwide, and owns and operates manufacturing facilities in Rio Nance, Honduras and the Caribbean.\n\nGlenn and Greg Chamandy founded Gildan in 1984 with the acquisition of a knitting mill in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to make fabric to supply the Harley Inc., the childrenswear business already owned by the family. It later expanded to sell t-shirts made of 100% cotton to wholesalers, which resold them to United States and Canadian screen-printers, to be decorated with designs and logos. By 1994, Harley was closed in order to focus on the expansion of what had become Gildan Activewear.\n\nThe combination of very low wages and advanced technology has allowed Gildan to lower its price per shirt to below that of Chinese manufacturers.\n\nGildan opened its first offshoring sewing facility in Honduras, in 1997. The plant was vertically integrated and employed 1,200 workers. A year later, the company achieved an Initial public offering and was listed publicly on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and the NYSE MKT.\n\nBy 2001, Gildan was the leading distributor of 100% cotton T-shirts in the US as determined by the ACNielsen S.T.A.R.S.

The school was founded by Royal Charter in 1561 but can trace its roots back to at least the 13th century. It is a registered charity under English law. It was a boys' school from its foundation until 1978, when the first girls were admitted.\n\nIn 2018 the GCSE results recorded 85% of grades were A*/A or 9-7, and at A-level 62.7% of all grades were A or A*. The \"Good Schools Guide\" described the school as \"An academic school with a modern edge\".\n\nThe school's history is traceable into the Middle Ages, where there are references to schoolmasters like Gilbert de Southwell in 1272, described as \"Rector of the Schools in Kingston\", and to Hugh de Kyngeston in 1364 \"who presides over the Public School there\". Notable in the school's history are the founding and endowing of the Lovekyn Chapel by John and then Edward Lovekyn in 1309-1352 and later by William Walworth in 1371. The chapel is still used by the school.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the chantries in 1547, the chapel fell to the Crown and was deconsecrated. It, and by now its substantial related endowments, fell to a court favourite, Richard Taverner. He preserved the chapel so when in 1561 the bailiffs of Kingston petitioned Queen Elizabeth I for a royal grammar school, the building was still usable. The Queen granted the school a Royal Charter in 1561.\n\nThe school became a direct grant grammar school in 1946 as a result of the Education Act 1944 and became independent in 1978 after the scheme was abolished by the 1974–79 Labour Government. In the same year, the first girls were admitted.\n\nKGS celebrated the four hundredth anniversary of its founding charter in 1961 with a visit from Queen Elizabeth II. In 2005 she opened the new Queen Elizabeth II Building, where she unveiled a plaque, met with students of Music and Geography and watched an excerpt of the play \"Smike\" after which the new Recording Studio was named.\n\nOn 1 May 1965 the school opened its new playing fields at Thames Ditton, alongside which was built its boathouse. Prior to this it had shared Kingston Rowing Club's boathouse, and had owned much smaller playing fields at Dinton Road, Kingston.\n\nThere are five houses, named after Medieval and Elizabethan figures connected with the school and the city of London, with the exception of Stanley Shoveller, an Old Kingstonian who played international hockey in the early 20th century.\n\nThe school's boathouse is on the Thames at Thames Ditton, Surrey. Students may take up rowing beginning in Third Form (Year 9) and participate in local and national regattas, including The National Schools Regatta.

{"id": "1871862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871862", "title": "Foundation species", "text": "Foundation species\n\nIn ecology, the term foundation species is used to refer to a species that has a strong role in structuring a community. A foundation species can occupy any trophic level in a food web (i.e., they can be primary producers, herbivores or predators). The term was coined by Paul K. Dayton in 1972, who applied it to certain members of marine invertebrate and algae communities. It was clear from studies in several locations that there were a small handful of species whose activities had a disproportionate effect on the rest of the marine community and they were therefore key to the resilience of the community. Dayton’s view was that focusing on foundation species would allow for a simplified approach to more rapidly understand how a community as a whole would react to disturbances, such as pollution, instead of attempting the extremely difficult task of tracking the responses of all community members simultaneously. The term has since been applied to range of organisms in ecosystems around the world, in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Aaron Ellison \"et al.\" introduced the term to terrestrial ecology by applying the term foundation species to tree species that define and structure certain forest ecosystems through their influences on associated organisms and modulation of ecosystem processes.\n\nA study conducted at the McKenzie Flats of the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico, a semiarid biome transition zone, observed the result of loss of a variety of different dominant and codominant foundation species of plants on the growth of other species. This transition zone consists of two Chihuahuan Desert species, black grama (\"Bouteloua eriopoda)\" and creosote bush (\"Larrea tridentata)\", and a shortgrass steppe species, blue grama (\"Bouteloua gracillis)\". Each species dominates an area with a specific soil environment. Black grama dominates sandy soils, while blue grama dominates in soils with high clay content, and creosote bush dominates fine-textured soil with surface gravel. This study noted that responses to the loss of foundation species is dependent on a variety of different factors from the ability of a species to recover to the climate conditions of the ecosystem to the patterns in dominance and explored the possible reasons for the outcomes of the study. The results indicated that in areas with just one dominant foundation species, its loss caused a shift in dominance to a mixed dominant community. For example, the creosote bush dominated shrubland saw a shift in dominance to 32% by other shrubs, 26% by perennial grasses, and 22% by perennial forbs following the removal of creosote bush. Another finding was that regardless of the community type and the species removed, the loss of foundation species resulted in an overall increase in black grama supporting the notion that the outcome is greatly affected by recovery ability of species removed or loss.\n\nAnother study observed the effects of loss of foundation eastern hemlocks (\"Tsuga canadensis\") in a forest ecosystem. Eastern hemlocks are a foundation species in eastern North American forests, but have been threatened by the accidental introduction of woolly adelgid. This study observed the effects that a loss in eastern hemlocks would have on the populations of arthropods, such as ants, beetles, and spiders, since these species are known indicators of environmental change. The results found that in areas of hemlock removal, there was an overall increase and influx of arthropod species. Researchers suggested that this was due to an increase in open habitats from the loss of the hemlocks. The results of this hemlock study corroborated with those from the previous McKenzie Flats study discussed in that the loss of foundation species led to a proliferation of species diversity in the affected area. These results seem to contradict a long-standing belief that foundation species play a vital role in communities and ecosystems by creating habitats for organisms, suggesting that in some circumstances they bottleneck species diversity.\n\nFoundation species play a vital role in structuring a community; however, this can be in a variety of different ways. The presence of a foundation species has the ability to either reduce or increase species diversity depending on its particular role in a specific ecosystem. The studies discussed highlighted examples in which foundation species limited species diversity in similar and differing taxa (the McKenzie Flats and eastern hemlock studies, respectively); however, there are many other examples in which removal of foundation species could decrease species diversity within the same or differing taxa.\n\n"}

He was also a member of the Public Bill Committee for the Defence Reform Act 2014.\n\nIn May 2014 he was one of seven unsuccessful candidates for the chairmanship of the House of Commons Defence Select Committee.\n\nIn 2015, he backed the move by IPSA to increase salaries for politicians by 10% when the rest of the public sector were on a freeze of 1%. He apologised for any offence caused by the comment that without the proposed raise to his £90,000 salary he would be \"watching the pennies\" but also reminded that he had taken a salary cut when becoming an MP.\n\nIn September 2015, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority named Ellwood and 25 current and former MPs who failed to settle a total of approximately £2,000 the previous year in overclaimed expenses, forcing them to be written off. The debts ranged from £309 to £7.50. The expenses claim that Ellwood had submitted of £26.50 was subsequently settled.\n\nEllwood voted to remain in the 2016 EU referendum. He later stated that the leave result should nevertheless be respected and that the government should not try to reverse this decision.\n\nOn 22 March 2017, during a terrorist attack on Parliament, Ellwood gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and CPR to police officer Keith Palmer, who later died of his injuries. Ellwood was called a \"hero\" by those at Westminster and the press, as photos surfaced of him with blood on his face while he crouched over the body of the dying police officer. Consequently, Ellwood received a lot of praise on social media for his actions, as well as being promised an appointment to the Privy Council for his response in the attack. Elwood's appointment to the Privy Council was formally approved on 12 April 2017.\n\nIn September 2018, Ellwood announced that he had been promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel as a reservist in the 77th Brigade.\n\nIn 2018, there was endorsement from many parts of the Conservative Party for Ellwood to run to be its next leader. However, he did not stand in the 2019 leadership election, but instead endorsed Matt Hancock, then subsequently Rory Stewart.\n\nIn July 2005, Ellwood married Hannah Ryan, a corporate lawyer, in East Yorkshire. He has a sister, Charlotte Ellwood-Aris. His brother, Jonathan, who was director of studies at the International School Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, was killed in the 2002 Bali bombing.\n\nIn June 2009, Ellwood was attacked by a gang of youths after confronting them for playing football in the street. The gang threw stones at him and Ellwood was punched in the head. A 17-year-old male was arrested over the attack.\n\nEllwood has written the following recent publications:\n\n\n"}

It was the second oldest university of the Netherlands, founded shortly after Leiden University.\n\nAlso known as \"Academiae Franekerensis\" or the University of Friesland, it was the stopover for many Puritans, such as Peter Stuyvesant, escaping the persecutions of Bishop Laud on their way to, eventually, the American Continent. It consisted of departments of Theology, Law, Medicine, Philosophy, Mathematics and Physics.\n\nInitially the university had an excellent reputation, attracting students from far and wide, but from 1700 its fortune changed. The university was disbanded by Napoleon in 1811, along with the Universities of Harderwijk and Utrecht. After the end of the French régime, the university was not restored. Instead, an \"Athenaeum illustre\" was founded, which did not have the right to issue doctoral degrees. In 1843, the \"Athenaeum\" itself was disbanded because of a lack of students.\n\nToday, Franeker has no institute of higher education, although postgraduate students from the University of Groningen are permitted to defend their thesis in the Franeker Martinikerk, provided they are Frisian or their thesis subject has a connection to Friesland.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1871873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871873", "title": "Meise Botanic Garden", "text": "Meise Botanic Garden\n\nThe Meise Botanic Garden (, ; until 2014 called the National Botanic Garden of Belgium (, )) is located in the grounds of Bouchout Castle in the town of Meise, just north of Brussels in the province of Flemish Brabant. It is one of the largest botanical gardens in the world with an extensive collection of living plants in addition to a herbarium of over 3 million specimens. The current garden was established in 1958 after it moved from the centre of Brussels; the former site is now the Botanical Garden of Brussels. Researchers at the garden conduct research particularly on Belgian and African plants.\n\nThe Botanic Garden contains about 18,000 plant species—about 6% of all known plant species of the world. Half are in greenhouses, the other half, including cultivated and indigenous plants, are outdoors. The gardens are grouped around the castle and lake of the Bouchout domain.\n\nThe mission statement of the Meise Botanic Garden specifies the increasing and spreading \"the knowledge of plants\" and contributions to \"the conservation of biodiversity.\"\n\nThe Botanic Garden was property of the Belgian federal government, but after several years of negotiations it was eventually transferred to the Flemish Community (Flanders) effective 1 January 2014. The French Community still has its own employees and representation in the board of directors. The plants, library, etc. remain property of the federal State but given as commodate to the Flemish Community.\n\nThe first botanic garden in Brussels belonged to the du Département de la Dyle that was created during the French rule of Belgium at the end of the 18th century. Due to their costs, those French schools were soon dropped and some municipalities, including the City of Brussels, took over the garden that was about to be abandoned. In 1815, Belgium became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. Around the same period, the maintenance costs of the garden were regarded as too high by the city administration. A group of local bourgeois decided to create a new kind of botanical garden in Brussels. At the time the bourgeoisie was the new leading-class and since companies were popular financing method the garden was created as a company. The creators thought it would be their contribution to the city's reputation. Although it was rooted on a private enterprise, it was also supposed to be a national institution dedicated to science.\n\nBoth the City and the Home Office supported it financially. But, the Independence of Belgium (1830-1831) was detrimental to the Dutch-born institution: it was regarded as orangist, as a mere playground for the local elites, and as not useful for the country's agriculture, among other critiques. From then on, the garden would have to battle to survive. The state and the city did not want to support it anymore unless it proved useful to the whole country, so the Garden was obliged to develop its commercial activities. It sold plants by the thousands, and created several money-consuming attractions and events for the local élite, like aquaria, a dance room, fairs, a fish nursery, concerts etc. In the 1860s, the aging buildings required renovation. The board of the Society of Horticulture tried to raise the money, but the costs were just too high for the company. In 1870, the Belgian Government took over the company. The National Botanic Garden was created in the very same year. Barthélemy Dumortier (1797-1878), a Belgian politician and botanist, had played a major role in this process. He wanted a “Belgian Kew” to be created in the capital of Belgium, that is to say a botanical garden dedicated to taxonomy. That is why, some months before the garden was bought by the state, the Belgian Government had purchased the famous von Martius Herbarium that was held in Munich. So, in 1870, Belgium had a great herbarium and an appropriate building. This was the dawn of a new era for Belgian botany.\n\nIn 1927, just after the death of Empress Charlotte, it was proposed to set up the National Botanical Garden at the Bouchout Domain. It took until 1937 before the final decision was made and major constructions were started. To the southeast of Bouchout Castle, the \"Palace of the Plants\" was built, which consists of a number of greenhouses. Farther to the southwest of the castle, the Victorian Balat greenhouse was placed. This greenhouse was designed in 1853 by Alfonse Balat and transported from its original location at the Botanical Garden of Brussels.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Bouchout Castle was occupied by the German forces and the domain was altered into a fortress. Next to the Palace of Plants, six barracks were placed and concrete defenses were erected. The court of honour of Bouchout Castle was used to store ammunition, while artillery defenses were placed at the borders of the domain. The last German soldiers left Bouchout domain at 3 September 1944. Just a few days later, the Allied Forces arrived; they used it as a training location, while stationing about 200 vehicles at the domain. At 29 November 1944, a bomb exploded at the western part of the park, destroying the windows of Bouchout Castle. A second bomb exploded on 2 December at the nearby Hoogvorst Castle, causing its complete destruction.\n\n\n"}

He is currently signed with All Elite Wrestling (AEW), where he is a member of SoCal Uncensored. He is known for his work in Ring of Honor (ROH) under the ring name Frankie Kazarian where he is a three-time ROH World Tag Team Champion and one time ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Champion. He is also known for his work with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), under the ring names Kazarian, Suicide, and Kaz.\n\nKazarian also wrestled in the independent promotion Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, where he won the PWG World Championship in 2003 and 2004. Also, he is the inaugural PWG World Champion when he won the Bad Ass Mother tournament. Kazarian is also a five-time TNA X Division Champion and a three-time TNA World Tag Team Champion.\n\nKazarian began training with Killer Kowalski in Malden, Massachusetts in 1998, and wrestled his debut match after one month's training, facing Freight Train Dan. After remaining at Kowalski's school for eight months, Kazarian returned to Southern California and began wrestling on the independent circuit, primarily in the Empire Wrestling Federation, where he continued his training and teamed with Josh Galaxy as \"Bad Influence\".\n\nImpact Wrestling commentator Mike Tenay revealed in a late 2007 shoot interview that during a World Championship Wrestling event in San Diego, California in 2000, a fan appeared to him and boldly declared that \"someday, [Tenay] will be calling one of [his] matches\". That fan was none other than Kazarian himself.\n\nIn 2000, Kazarian joined Ultimate Pro Wrestling, and in March 2001 he formed a tag team with Nova known as \"Evolution\". On March 10, 2001, he became the first Millennium Pro Wrestling (MPW) World Champion by defeating Christopher Daniels and \"Scrap Iron\" Adam Pearce in a three–way dance. On May 30, 2001, Evolution won the vacant Ultimate Pro Wrestling Tag Team title. He travelled to Japan as part of the Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW) roster in 2002, where he faced Steve Corino, and also as part of Evolution he and Nova were defeated by Edge and Christian. He used to freestyle rap along with his close friends John Cena and Samoa Joe while the three of them were on the road in UPW.\n\nHe toured the UK, Australia and New Zealand with the now defunct World Wrestling All-Stars promotion in May 2003, where he met Glenn Gilberti and Scott D'Amore, leading to his being offered a job by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling.\n\nKazarian also worked for Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, and won a tournament to become the first ever PWG Champion on August 30, 2003. He held the title until February 22, 2004 when he was defeated by Adam Pearce. On July 10, 2004, he became their first 2-time champion, however, when he regained the title from Adam Pearce in a \"Loser Leaves PWG\" steel cage match. He would hold the title until November 13, when he was defeated by Super Dragon.\n\nKazarian knew Impact Wrestling President Jeff Jarrett and Scott D'Amore during a World Wrestling All-Stars tour and they invited him to a tryout. Kazarian joined Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) in the summer of 2003, and quickly began pursuing the TNA X Division Championship. He was part of the first ever Ultimate X match, on August 20, 2003 along with Michael Shane and Chris Sabin, which was won by Shane. Kazarian did not appear with TNA Wrestling between October 2003 and March 2004.\n\nAfter Chris Sabin was stripped of the title while sidelined with a knee injury, Kazarian eventually won the X Division title on March 31, 2004, defeating The Amazing Red in a match for the vacant title. He lost the belt to A.J. Styles on June 9, 2004.\n\nIn June 2004 he and Shane formed a tag team (informally known as Shazarian) managed by Traci Brooks. They claimed to resent the fact that A.J. Styles had held the TNA X Division Championship, then the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, then had won the X Division Championship once more. This was purportedly illegal according to a previously unknown by law of the Impact Wrestling rulebook, which stated that an X Division competitor who participated for the Heavyweight Championship could not return to the X Division. On July 28, 2004, he and Shane faced Styles in an Ultimate X match. Kazarian and Shane were declared co-champions when both took possession of the title belt at the same time. On August 11 they defended the title in a twenty two man Gauntlet for the Gold match. Kazarian started at number one and was one of the final three participants, but was eliminated by The Amazing Red, who in turn was eliminated by Petey Williams.\n\nKazarian was put in the same situation at November's Victory Road where he entered number one in a 20-man X Division Gauntlet and was the last man eliminated.\n\nThroughout late 2004 and early 2005, Kazarian and Shane competed in the TNA tag team division. Kazarian's contract with TNA Wrestlng expired in September 2004 and was not renewed, but he continued working with the company on a per appearance basis. The duo eventually began a feud with the 3Live Kru and Jeff Hammond, a NASCAR analyst who was working with Impact Wrestling as a commentator. This led to a match at the Against All Odds pay-per-view on February 13, 2005 between Hammond and Kru member B.G. James and Shane and Kazarian. Kazarian was pinned by Hammond after Shane miscued on a superkick and knocked him out.\n\nOn February 25, 2005, Kazarian left Impact Wrestling and signed with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). He was assigned to Ohio Valley Wrestling, the primary developmental territory of WWE. He made his WWE television debut during an episode of \"Velocity\" on July 16, 2005, under the name \"The Future\" Frankie Kazarian defeating Nunzio, and remained undefeated throughout July and into August. During this time, he picked up victories against Scotty 2 Hotty, Funaki, and Paul London. On August 15, Kazarian announced on his website that he had left WWE two days earlier. He later revealed that he had asked for his release after realizing that the company had no plans to revamp its cruiserweight division.\n\nKazarian returned to the Californian independent circuit shortly after his release. He wrestled on the August 19 Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG) show in Los Angeles, \"Smells Like Steen Spirit\", where he teamed with Petey Williams to unsuccessfully challenge the \"2 Skinny Black Guys\" (El Generico and Human Tornado) for the PWG Tag Team Championship.\n\nDuring PWG's \"(Please Don't Call it) The O.C.\"on May 6, 2006, Kazarian's signature ponytail was cut off by Scorpio Sky, who he was feuding with at the time. While in WWE the previous year, Kazarian had gotten in trouble with company management after refusing to cut his hair and this was one of the reasons he had asked for his release. This would begin a nine-month rivalry during which Scorpio Sky would defeat Kazarian in a \"First Blood\" match. In September, Kazarian beat Scorpio Sky in the first round of the 2006 Battle of Los Angeles by disqualification, when Scorpio's manager Jade Chung attacked Kazarian with scissors when he was pinning Scorpio. Kazarian was eliminated from the tournament in the second round due to being unable to compete after being assaulted by Sky's stable, The Dynasty. The feud ended on January 13, 2007 when Kazarian beat Sky in a \"Loser Leaves PWG\" match, just as he did with Adam Pearce. Kazarian left PWG in May 2007, when TNA Wrestling pulled all of their talent from the company. On February 24, 2008, Kazarian made a one night return to PWG, when he took part in the tournament to crown the new PWG World Champion. He was, however, eliminated in the first round by Karl Anderson.\n\nKazarian returned to TNA on July 16, 2006 at Victory Road, in a Championship match loss to TNA X Division Champion Senshi. Afterwards he and his old tag team partner Michael Shane (now known as \"Maverick\" Matt Bentley due to name trademark issues) resumed in their tag team, before disappearing from television for weeks. Later resurfacing with a new goth look, the duo would be joined by Johnny Devine and all became subservient to Raven, forming the stable Serotonin. As part of Serotonin, his name was shortened to the simple and supposedly cryptic \"Kaz\". Kaz eventually became the first Serotonin member to become very rebellious towards Raven. Kaz turned on Raven on June 21, 2007 by attacking fellow members of Serotonin, Havok and Martyr, costing him a match against Chris Harris.\n\nAfter his split with Serotonin, he began using his old ring attire and entrance video which both said the full \"Kazarian\" - though it was all later changed to only say the simple Kaz except for a few references on the TNA website. Shortly after this, he engaged in a brief feud with Robert Roode over his treatment of Ms. Brooks. Kaz would next be entered in the 2007 Fight for the Right Tournament, which he won by defeating Christian Cage at Genesis in the finals in a ladder match. On the \"Impact!\" following Genesis, Kurt Angle barely defeated Kaz to retain the TNA World Championship.\nAt the 2007 Turning Point pay-per-view, he was partnered with Booker T against Christian Cage and Robert Roode, with Kaz and Booker winning. He then began attacking Dustin Rhodes, and stealing things from Rhodes' alter ego \"Black Reign\". He defeated Black Reign at Final Resolution. After defeating Black Reign, Kaz and Black Reign competed in a Four Corner Mouse Trap match were Kaz won but Black Reign ended up getting his things back from Kaz after hitting Kaz with his Darkness Falls weapon. On February 23, Kaz defeated Rellik. After the match, Black Reign and Rellik attacked Kaz. Eric Young ran out to help but got too scared to do anything. At Destination X, Kaz and Young defeated Black Reign and Rellik leading to Kaz and Young (now 'Super Eric') becoming a tag team. On April 13, at Lockdown 2008, they won the Cuffed in a Cage match. On the April 17 episode of \"TNA Impact!\", following Lockdown, Kaz and Young defeated the holders of the TNA World Tag Team Championship, AJ Styles and Tomko and The Latin American Xchange (LAX) in a triple threat tag team match for the titles after Young's alter ego, \"Super Eric\" pinned Styles with a bridging suplex. Later in the night, Styles complained to Jim Cornette that since Young was signed to the match, not Super Eric, and Young claimed that he and Super Eric are different people, Super Eric's involvement was outside interference. When Eric refused to admit that he was Super Eric, Cornette vacated the titles.\n\nFollowing Kaz and Young's loss to LAX in a Deuces Wild Tournament qualifying match, Kaz competed in and won the Terror Dome Match at Sacrifice, becoming number one contender to the X Division Championship, and also taking Kurt Angle's place in the triple threat match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. The match was won by Samoa Joe, who retained the title. On the June 5 episode of \"Impact!\" Kaz won a future title match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in the first ever X Division King of the Mountain Match. He then failed to win the X Division championship at Slammiversary, losing to the X Division Champion Petey Williams. He then challenged Joe the following Thursday on \"Impact!\" for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in a losing effort. He led Team TNA in the 2008 World X Cup and was in the final round at Victory Road, but lost after he pulled off a huge leg drop on Daivari off the top of the Ultimate X structure. On July 21, 2008 TNA's official website announced that Kaz had been released, but it was revealed to be a storyline. He was later interviewed by Karen Angle to further the storyline, and claimed that after failing to beat Kurt Angle for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and letting down his company in the finals of the World X Cup, he had fallen out of love with wrestling and, so, had made the decision to leave.\n\nIn late 2008 Kazarian made his return to TNA Wrestling as a masked wrestler named Suicide, who was featured in Midway's \"TNA Impact!\" video game. He debuted at Final Resolution in December 2008 as a face, swinging to the ring on a cable, attacking the Motor City Machine Guns. At Destination X Suicide won the TNA X Division Championship, in his debut match, in the Ultimate X match. Because of an injury to Kazarian, Suicide was portrayed for several weeks by Christopher Daniels, who was in the costume when the character won the X Division Championship. Afterwards, Daniels began feuding with the Motor City Machineguns of Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin, who on the April 30 episode of \"Impact!\" accused him of being Suicide. On the May 7 episode of \"Impact!\", Jay Lethal and Consequences Creed joined the accusations by also accusing Daniels of being Suicide. On the May 14 episode of \"Impact!\" the Motor City Machineguns and Lethal Consequences were trying to unmask Suicide in an attempt to prove that they were right about his true identity, but Daniels made the save and helped Suicide clear the ring of Shelley, Sabin, Lethal, and Creed. At Slammiversary, Suicide retained the TNA X Division Championship against Shelley, Sabin, Lethal, and Creed, in a King of the Mountain match. On the July 16 episode of \"Impact!\" Suicide lost his X Division title to Homicide after he cashed in his \"Feast or Fired\" briefcase.\n\nAfter not being seen for a few weeks, Suicide made his return at Hard Justice to compete in the Steel Asylum match, which he lost because of D'Angelo Dinero. On the August 20 episode of \"Impact!\" Suicide attacked Dinero after his match with Consequences Creed sparking a feud between the two. On the September 17 episode of \"Impact!\" Dinero defeated Suicide in a grudge match. At No Surrender Dinero defeated Suicide again, this time in a Falls Count Anywhere match. The following week on \"Impact!\" Suicide finally defeated Dinero, by pinning him in a street fight. On the October 15 episode of \"Impact!\" Homicide stole Suicide's costume and claimed to now know his true identity. On the December 3 episode \"Impact!\" Suicide made peace with Dinero and joined him, Matt Morgan and Hernandez in their war with Rhino, Team 3D and Jesse Neal. At Final Resolution Morgan, Hernandez, Dinero and Suicide defeated Neal, Team 3D and Rhino in an eight-man elimination tag team match. On the February 11, 2010, episode of \"Impact!\" Gerdelman made his final TV appearance as Suicide, losing to Matt Morgan in an 8 Card Stud Tournament qualifying match.\n\nOn the February 18, 2010, episode of \"Impact!\", Gerdelman made his return as Kazarian, teaming up with Amazing Red and Generation Me (Jeremy Buck and Max Buck) in an eight-man tag team match, where they defeated X Division Champion Doug Williams, Brian Kendrick and the Motor City Machineguns, after Kazarian pinned Williams. The following week he defeated Kendrick to earn himself a match for the X Division Championship at Destination X. However, instead of waiting for the pay-per-view, Kazarian was given his title shot on the March 8 Monday night episode of \"Impact\" in a three-way match, which also included Daniels. In the end Williams was able to retain his title by pinning Daniels. At Destination X Kazarian defeated Daniels, Kendrick and Amazing Red in a four-way ladder match to earn another shot at the X Division Championship. At Lockdown Kazarian defeated Homicide and Shannon Moore in a three-way steel cage match to win the vacant TNA X Division Championship for the fourth time (counting his reign as Suicide), after Douglas Williams was stripped of the title due to being unable to attend the event. Upon Williams' return to TNA two weeks later, he refused to hand the X Division Championship belt over to Kazarian, unless he was able to defeat him for it. At Sacrifice Kazarian lost the X Division Championship to Williams without ever actually holding the physical belt.\nOn the following episode of \"Impact!\" Kazarian started showing signs of a heel turn, when he won an X Division battle royal to earn spot number ten in the TNA rankings for a World Title shot, impressing Ric Flair in the process. The heel turn was completed the following week, when Flair interfered in his match with Jay Lethal, which led to Kazarian scoring the roll-up victory, while grabbing a hold of his opponent's tights. After the match, Flair's other associate A.J. Styles, trying to impress his mentor, attacked Lethal, which led to an argument between him and Kazarian, who wanted to finish Lethal off himself. The distraction was enough for Lethal to dropkick both of them out of the ring. At Slammiversary VIII Kazarian lost his spot in the rankings to Kurt Angle.\n\nOn the following episode of \"Impact!\" Ric Flair, who had aligned himself with Kazarian, Styles, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm, announced that he would reform the Four Horsemen under the new name , stating that each of them would have to earn their spots in the group and in order for Kazarian to earn his spot, he needed to become the Barry Windham of the group. Flair, wanting peace between Kazarian and Styles, booked them in a tag team match against Samoa Joe and Rob Terry at Victory Road. The plan seemed to work as Kazarian and Styles were victorious due to outside interference from Desmond Wolfe and in the process earned themselves spots in . On the July 22 episode of \"Impact!\" Kazarian helped Styles defeat Rob Terry to win the TNA Global Championship. The following week 's lineup was seemingly completed with the addition of Robert Roode and James Storm as the final two members of the group. However, on the August 12 episode of \"Impact!\" Douglas Williams and Matt Morgan were added to , as the stable attacked EV 2.0, a stable consisting of former Extreme Championship Wrestling performers. In the weeks leading to Bound for Glory, the stable's name was tweaked to Fortune to represent the expansion in the number of members in the group. At Bound for Glory Kazarian, Styles, Morgan, Roode and Storm were defeated in a Lethal Lockdown match by EV 2.0 members Tommy Dreamer, Raven, Rhino, Sabu and Stevie Richards. On the following episode of \"Impact!\" Fortune formed an alliance with Hulk Hogan's and Eric Bischoff's new stable, Immortal. The following week Kazarian was given the objective of ending Mr. Anderson's World Heavyweight title aspirations in an Ultimate X match. Though Kazarian managed to win the match, with help from Fortune, Anderson survived and thus earned himself a title match against Immortal's Jeff Hardy. The following week tensions rose between former rivals and Fortune stable mates Kazarian and Douglas Williams, when Williams claimed he had not been given a chance to spotlight his talent, after joining Fortune, while Kazarian claimed Williams had a bad attitude and dubbed himself, Styles, Roode and Storm the \"Core Four\" of Fortune. On the November 4 episode of \"Impact!\", Flair ordered Kazarian and Williams to settle their differences in the ring. Kazarian won the match between the members of Fortune, after a miscommunication between Williams and James Storm. After the match Flair made Kazarian and Williams shake hands. At Turning Point the seemingly re–united Fortune defeated EV 2.0 in a ten-man tag team match and, as a result, EV 2.0's Sabu was released from TNA. However, on the November 18 episode of \"Impact!\" Williams turned on Fortune and joined Matt Morgan, who had been kicked out of the group the previous month, reigniting the feud between Kazarian and Williams. This was followed by Williams scoring back–to–back pinfall victories over Kazarian, first in an eight-man elimination tag team match on the November 25 episode of \"Impact!\" and then in a singles match on the December 2 episode of \"Impact!\". On the December 23 episode of \"Impact!\" Kazarian defeated Jeremy Buck, Max Buck and Robbie E in a four–way match to become the number one contender to the X Division Championship, held by Jay Lethal. On January 9, 2011, at Genesis Kazarian defeated Lethal to win the X Division Championship for the fifth time.\n\nOn January 31 at the tapings of the February 3 episode of \"Impact!\", Fortune turned face by attacking Immortal, when they interfered in a TNA World Heavyweight Championship match between Mr. Anderson and Jeff Hardy. Ric Flair, who did not take part in Fortune's turn due to being out with a torn rotator cuff, returned at the February 14 tapings of the February 17 episode of \"Impact!\", turning on Fortune and jumping to Immortal. On March 13 at Victory Road, Kazarian successfully defended the X Division Championship in an Ultimate X match against Jeremy Buck, Max Buck and Robbie E. On April 17 at Lockdown, Kazarian, Roode, Storm and Christopher Daniels, who replaced an injured A.J. Styles, defeated Immortal representatives Ric Flair, Abyss, Bully Ray and Matt Hardy in a Lethal Lockdown match. On May 16 at the tapings of the May 19 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Kazarian lost the X Division Championship to Abyss. On June 12 at Slammiversary IX, Kazarian failed to regain the title from Abyss in a three–way match with Brian Kendrick. In September, Kazarian began feuding with Jeff Jarrett over his and his wife Karen's treatment of her newly appointed assistant, Traci Brooks. In late 2011, Fortune disbanded, after both Christopher Daniels and Bobby Roode turned on their stablemates.\n\nOn the January 5, 2012, episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Kazarian and A.J. Styles were defeated in the finals of the Wild Card Tournament by the team of Magnus and Samoa Joe, when Kazarian abandoned Styles and left the ringside area with Christopher Daniels, turning heel in the process. Over the next few weeks it became apparent that Daniels was holding something over Kazarian, with Kazarian being reluctant to do his bidding. On February 12 at Against All Odds, Kazarian defeated Styles in a singles match. On the February 23 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Kazarian attacked Styles during his Television Championship match with Robbie E, allowing Robbie to retain the championship. On the following episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Kazarian defeated Styles in a gauntlet match; had Styles been successful, Kazarian would have to explain his alliance with Daniels. On March 18 at Victory Road, Kazarian and Daniels were defeated in a tag team match by Styles and Mr. Anderson. The rivalry continued on April 15 at Lockdown, where the two duos were on opposing teams in the annual Lethal Lockdown match. Styles' and Anderson's team, led by Garett Bischoff, ended up defeating Kazarian's and Daniels' team, led by Eric Bischoff. During Styles' absence from \"Impact Wrestling\", Kazarian and Daniels set their sights on the TNA World Tag Team Championship, attacking champions Magnus and Samoa Joe on the April 26 episode. On the May 10 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Kazarian revealed that he originally aligned himself with Daniels to keep him from revealing Styles' secret, but changed his mind after learning what the secret was. Daniels then revealed the secret, a series of photographs insinuating a relationship between Styles and TNA president Dixie Carter. Three days later at Sacrifice, Kazarian and Daniels defeated Magnus and Samoa Joe to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship, starting Kazarian's second reign with the title. Later in the event, Kazarian and Daniels cost A.J. Styles his match with Kurt Angle, who afterwards turned on the two, saving Styles from a beatdown. On June 10 at Slammiversary, Kazarian and Daniels lost the TNA World Tag Team Championship to Styles and Angle. On the June 21 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Styles and Carter proved that Kazarian and Daniels had been lying about their relationship by producing a pregnant woman named Claire Lynch, whom they had been helping overcome her addictions. The following week, Kazarian teased dissension with Daniels, claiming that he had been lied to.

The team, billed as \"The World Tag Team Champions of the World\", made their first televised title defense on the August 8 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", defeating Devon and Garett Bischoff. Three days later at Hardcore Justice, Kazarian unsuccessfully challenged Devon for the TNA Television Championship.

Following their elimination, Bad Influence attacked Park causing him to bleed from the mouth. The same night, during the PPV, Bad Influence interrupted the show to petition TNA management to place themselves into the TNA World Tag Team Championship match later that night between James Storm & Gunner and challengers The BroMans. However, before they got an answer Abyss appeared and attacked them. Over the following few weeks, Bad Influence would mock Park and try to reveal his true identity. On the November 5 edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", Bad Influence revealed that Park's law firm (Park, Park & Park) had closed 15 years ago and consequently Park had been lying about being a lawyer. On December 12, Bad Influence were defeated by Park & Young when Young caused his own partner to bleed resulting in Park transforming into Abyss, as a result of seeing his own blood, and gaining the victory.

{"id": "1871916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871916", "title": "Virginia General District Court", "text": "Virginia General District Court\n\nThe Virginia General District Court (GDC) is the lowest level of the Virginia court system, and is the court that most Virginians have contact with. The jurisdiction of the GDC is generally limited to traffic cases and other misdemeanors, civil cases involving amounts of under $25,000. There are 32 GDC districts, each having at least one judge, and each having a clerk of the court and a courthouse with courtroom facilities.\n\nThe GDCs are not courts of record, meaning that they do not keep detailed records of their proceedings and their decisions provide no precedent to be cited in other proceedings. Proceedings before the GDC are less formal than those brought before higher courts in the state. They do not conduct jury trials; cases are heard and decided by the judge. In civil cases, they are only empowered to award legal damages, and generally cannot provide remedies in equity, such as injunctions or declaratory judgments.\n\nThe subject-matter jurisdiction of the GDC is narrow, both with respect to civil cases and criminal cases. With respect to civil claims, it has sole authority to try cases involving amounts of $4,500 or less. It shares authority with the Virginia Circuit Court to try cases involving sums between $4,500 and $25,000. The amount in controversy is determined without considering interest or attorney's fees, even if recovery of these costs is specified in the contract. Within these limitations, the GDC can hear cases in tort or contract, and actions in detinue seeking the return of wrongfully held personal property. In determining whether the amount involved falls within the amount in controversy requirement, interest payments and attorney's fees contracted for in a written instrument.\n\nIn cases involving unlawful detainer of real estate used for \"business\", \"commercial\", or \"agricultural\" purposes, the GDC may hear cases involving claims of rent owed and property damage without limitation. If the real estate is used for residential purposes, then the $25,000 limit applies. The GDC may issue distress warrants establishing the rights of a creditor to seize property, again without limit as to the amount. Conversely, the GDC may order the attachment of personal property valued up to $25,000, but has no authority to order the attachment of real estate, no matter how low the value. With respect to criminal cases, the GDC may only try misdemeanors. The GDC also has no authority over domestic relations matters such as divorce, annulment, and child custody, nor does it have authority over the probate of wills, which are directed to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts. The only injunctive relief that the GDC may grant is in enforcing the state's Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThe GDC must also be able to exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendant, which may be premised on the defendant's physical presence in the jurisdiction, or on the occurrence of some element of the cause of action in the jurisdiction. Personal jurisdiction is predicated on Virginia's long-arm statute, which generally permits Virginia courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over a party that resides in Virginia, or transacts substantial business in Virginia, or who caused an actionable injury in Virginia. A party may waive a lack of personal jurisdiction, but may also appear in court to contest personal jurisdiction without thereby waiving the issue.\n\nIn terms of venue, where personal jurisdiction lies in multiple districts, the appropriate venue for the case to be heard is set forth by Virginia statutes, which divides possible venues as \"Category A\" (preferred) and \"Category B\" (permissible), and requires that Category B venue may only be used where no Category A venue is available. For example, in a dispute over the ownership of land, Category A venue lies where the land is located. Most Category A venue provisions of the Virginia statutes are inapplicable to the GDC, which does not have subject matter jurisdiction over divorce and probate matters, and can not issue injunctions. In the types of cases that can be heard in the GDC, venue is generally deemed \"objectionable\" if it is not where the defendant resides or has a registered office or registered agent, or where some part of the action arose.\n\nGDC proceedings are relatively informal. It is not necessary to file formal pleadings. Rather, a plaintiff can fill out and serve the defendant with a \"civil warrant\", which is a form provided by the Clerk of the Court containing blanks to be filled in identifying the parties and the cause of action. Alternatively, the plaintiff can draft his own \"notice of motion for judgment\". The notice provided to the defendant must instruct the defendant of several things. It must explain how the trial date will be set; it must inform the defendant that failure to appear and contest the claim can result in a default being entered; and, under something of a quirk of Virginia law, it must tell the defendant how they may object to venue. The defendant need not file an answer at all, but can simply show up in court on the designated \"return date\" and contest the claim. The civil warrant may be served on the defendant by the sheriff or deputy of the county in which the defendant resides, unless the plaintiff opts to have service of process effected by an officer of the court. The return date is the date on which the defendant must appear in court, and can be anywhere from 5 to 60 days after service of process is effected.\n\nIf the defendant feels that the plaintiff has not provided enough information about the cause of action, he may file a motion for a \"bill of particulars\", and if the court grants such a motion then the plaintiff will be ordered to provide the requested details. If the cause of action is premised on a written instrument such as a contract or a deed, the original document must be provided to the court, and the defendant may use a motion for a bill of particulars to compel the production of this document as well. The plaintiff, on the other hand, may file a motion for \"grounds of defense\", which, if granted, will result in an order requiring the defendant to submit a written response indicating the defenses that it intends to assert. If the plaintiff fails to respond to a bill of particulars, or the defendant fails to provide requested grounds of defense, the court may enter summary judgment against the non-responsive party.\n\nA defendant may also file a counterclaim against the plaintiff, or a cross-claim against a co-defendant, at any point before the trial begins, so long as the amount is within the jurisdictional limits of the GDC. Failure to file a counterclaim, however, does not effect a waiver of that counterclaim. A defendant may implead a third party anytime within ten days after service of process has been effected, up until the trial date, so long as the third party receives effective service of process. However, Virginia law prohibits a defendant from impleading a joint tortfeasor against whom the plaintiff is prohibited from recovering (such as plaintiff's employer in a negligent injury case, which would be covered by the state's workman's compensation). Virginia law does not recognize the doctrine of necessary and indispensable parties, so the inability to implead a party will not affect the court's jurisdiction over the case.\n\nThe GDC can also entertain interpleader causes of action, allowing a party holding something of value to force all competing claimants to litigate which of them has the superior claim. As with other causes of action, the jurisdictional limitations must be met. It must be remembered that the GDC has no injunctive power; while the Circuit Courts can issue injunctions prohibiting parties from litigating the interpleader claim in other forums, the GDC can not prevent this. Finally, there is no right of intervention in GDC proceedings; a third party that wishes to become a party to a pending case can not do so except on a motion of an existing party to the case.\n\nThere is virtually no pretrial discovery available at the GDC level. However, a witness may be compelled to appear at the trial itself through a subpoena, and may be required to bring documents through a subpoena duces tecum. The party seeking to subpoena a witness must file a request for subpoena at least 15 days before trial, or else they will have to show \"good cause\" for why a subpoena should issue.\n\nAs there are no juries in the GDC, trial is relatively fast and informal. Evidence is presented by oral testimony of witnesses, although personal injury damages may be proved by written records from a hospital or health care provider. If a written medical report by a health care provider is introduced, the party seeking to introduce it must notify the other party at least 10 days before the trial. The health care provider must swear out a statement affirming that they treated this patient and attesting that the report fully describes the injury, and is true and accurate as to the description of the injury and any statement of costs.\n\nA party seeking a rehearing of a judgment must file the motion requesting this relief within 21 days of entry of the judgment. The cases are divided on whether the court must rule on the motion during the 21-day period.\n\nAppeals from the GDC for civil matters in excess of $50, and for all criminal and traffic cases, go to the Virginia Circuit Court, where they are re-tried \"de novo\" (because the GDC does not generate a record to be reviewed for error). The appellant in the Circuit Court will then be entitled to a jury trial, even if they were not entitled to one in the GDC. If the case is a criminal case or traffic infraction, the appellant will automatically receive a jury trial in the Circuit Court unless they affirmatively waive this right. For civil cases on appeal, the appellant must request a jury; if no such request is made, then the appeal will be heard by a Circuit Court judge alone. Cases heard in the GDC may not be directly appealed to any court other than the Circuit Court, although the decisions of the Circuit Court are subject to further appellate review. In determining whether the matter exceeds $50, the Circuit Court looks to the recovery achieved by the plaintiff. If, for example, the plaintiff seeks $3,000 and recovers $2,960, the plaintiff will have \"no\" right to appeal, but the defendant will (having been assessed a judgment well in excess of $50). On retrial in the Circuit Court brought about by an appeal from the defendant, the plaintiff may seek leave to amend to increase the claim to an amount in excess of the $25,000 limitation of the GDC.\n\nTo appeal a case from the GDC to the Circuit Court, a notice of appeal must be filed with the clerk of the GDC within 10 days after a judgment or conviction has been entered by the GDC. The appellant must then post a bond and pay a writ tax in the GDC within 30 days of the judgment, or within 10 days of the judgment if the case is one of unlawful detainer.\n\n\n"}

It is one of the most important clay tennis tournaments in the world with the men's competition being an ATP Tour Masters 1000 event on the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) tour, and the women's competition being a Premier 5 event on the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) tour. The two events were combined in 2011. The tournament is played on clay courts, currently during the second week of May. The event is also known as the \"Rome Masters\" for male edition, as well as sponsored name \"Internazionali BNL d'Italia.\" Rafael Nadal has won the men's singles title a record nine times.\n\nThe Italian tennis championship was first held in 1930 in Milan at the Tennis Club and was initiated by Count Alberto Bonacossa. The singles events at the tournament were won by Bill Tilden and Lilí Álvarez. The championships were held in Milan until 1934. The next year, 1935, the event moved to the \"Foro Italico\" in Rome. No edition was held between 1936 and 1949. The competition resumed in 1950. In 1961 the tournament was held in Turin at the Sporting Club.\n\nThe Italian Open became \"open\" to professional players in 1969. Between 1970 and 1989 it was a premier tournament of the Grand Prix Tennis Tour and was part of the Grand Prix Super Series top tier events. In 1990 it became an ATP Championship Series Single Week tournament. In 1979 the women's event was held two weeks before the men's event. The women's event was played in Perugia from 1980 though 1984 and in Taranto in 1985. No women's event was held in 1986 and it moved back to Rome again in 1987 where it has remained.\n\nSource: The Tennis Base\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Jerusalem Botanical Gardens opened to the public in 1985. The tropical conservatory opened in 1986 and the South Africa section was planted in 1989. The Hank Greenspan Entrance Plaza, Dvorsky Visitors’ Center and restaurant were built in 1990.\n\nPlans for the first National Botanic Garden of Israel, on a plot of land purchased on Mount Scopus in 1926, were drawn up by Alexander Eig, chairman of the Botany Department of the Hebrew University, based on the flora of the Land of Israel from Mount Lebanon to the desert. Planting began in 1931. The botanical gardens on Mount Scopus were the first home of the Biblical Zoo. \n\nIn 1948, in the 1947–1949 Palestine war, access to Mount Scopus and the university campus was cut off from the rest of Israel, and it was decided to create a new Botanical Garden (the subject of this entry) near the Jewish National and University Library, on the new campus of the Hebrew University in Givat Ram in western Jerusalem. The new Botanical Garden, including a unique collection of Coniferae, was opened in 1954, soon after the establishment of Givat Ram campus. In 1962, a rocky hill in the southeastern corner of the campus was planted with conifers from North America. That year, Michael Avishai was appointed scientific director of the gardens. Many of the trees were raised from his private seed collection.\n\nBudgeting was a serious problem until 1975, when the Society of Friends of the Botanical Gardens was established and the garden became a joint project of the university, the Jerusalem Municipality and the Jewish National Fund. A scientific board was appointed, and architect Shlomo Aronson was commissioned to plan the layout. In 1981, the Garden Association was founded, and a board of executives appointed. The garden was opened to the public in 1985. In 1994, it separated from the Hebrew University, and has been managed by the Botanical Garden Association since 1996.\n\nThe garden's Japanese section contains over 150 bonsai trees, the largest concentrated collection of bonsai trees in the world.\n\nBirdwatchers have identified 46 species of birds that visit the Gardens throughout the year.\n\nThe 500-meter long \"Bible Path\" is planted with most of the 70 species that scientists have identified as some of the 400 types of plants mentioned in the Bible.\n\nOne of the goals of the garden is to create a living gene bank to protect endangered plants in Israel and the region as a whole.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1871953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871953", "title": "Falangism", "text": "Falangism\n\nFalangism () was the political ideology of the Falange Española de las JONS and afterwards, of the Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista (both known simply as the \"Falange\") as well as derivatives of it in other countries. Under the leadership of Francisco Franco, it largely became an authoritarian, conservative ideology connected with Francoist Spain.\n\nOpponents to the 1937 Unification Decree enacted by Franco that fused the FE de las JONS into FET y de las JONS included former Falange leader Manuel Hedilla. Falangism places a strong emphasis on Catholic religious identity, though it has held some secular views on the Church's direct influence in society as it believed that the state should have the supreme authority over the nation. Falangism emphasized the need for total authority, hierarchy and order in society. Like fascism, Falangism is anti-communist, anti-democratic and anti-liberal; under Franco, the Falange abandoned its original anti-capitalist tendencies, declaring the ideology to be fully compatible with capitalism.\n\nThe Falange's original manifesto, the \"Twenty-Seven Points\", declared Falangism to support the unity of Spain and the elimination of regional separatism, the establishment of a dictatorship led by the Falange, utilizing violence to regenerate Spain, and promoting the revival and development of the Spanish Empire, all attributes that it had in common with fascism. The manifesto supported a social revolution to create a national syndicalist economy that creates national syndicates of both employees and employers to mutually organize and control the economic activity, agrarian reform, industrial expansion and respect for private property with the exception of nationalizing credit facilities to prevent capitalist usury. It supports criminalization of strikes by employees and lockouts by employers as illegal acts. Falangism mirrors social democratic policies in that it supports the state to have jurisdiction of setting wages. The Franco-era Falange supported the development of cooperatives such as the Mondragon Corporation because it bolstered the Francoist claim of the nonexistence of social classes in Spain during his rule.\n\nThe Spanish Falange and its affiliates in Hispanic states across the world promoted a form of panhispanism known as \"hispanidad\" that advocated both cultural and economic union of Hispanic societies around the world.\n\nFalangism has attacked both the political left and the right as its \"enemies\", declaring itself to be neither left nor right, but a syncretic third position. Scholarly sources reviewing Falangism place it on the far right.\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, the Falange and the Carlists prior to the two parties' unification in 1937 both promoted the incorporation of Portugal into Spain. Both prior to and after its merger with the Carlists, the Falange supported the unification of Gibraltar and Portugal into Spain. During its early years of existence, the Falange produced maps of Spain that included Portugal as a province of Spain. The Carlists stated that a Carlist Spain would retake Gibraltar and Portugal. After the civil war, some radical members of the Falange called for a reunification with Portugal and annexation of former Spanish territories in the French Pyrenees. During World War II, Franco in a communiqué with Germany on 26 May 1942 declared that Portugal should be made a part of Spain.\n\nSome of the Falangists in Spain had supported racialism and racialist policies, viewing races as both real and existing with differing strengths, weaknesses and accompanying cultures inextricably obtained with them. However, unlike other racialists such as the National Socialists, Falangism is unconcerned about racial purity and does not denounce other races for being inferior, claiming \"that every race has a particular cultural significance\" and claiming that the intermixing of the Spanish race and other races has produced a \"Hispanic supercaste\" that is \"ethically improved, morally robust, spiritually vigorous\". It was less concerned about biological Spanish racial regeneration than it was in advocating the necessity of Spanish Catholic spiritual regeneration. Some have nonetheless promoted eugenics designed to eliminate physical and psychological damage caused by pathogenic agents. Falangism did and still does support natality policies to stimulate increased fertility rate among ideal physically and morally fit citizens.\nFranco praised Spain's Visigothic heritage, saying that the Germanic tribe of the Visigoths gave Spaniards their \"national love for law and order\". During early years of the Falangist regime of Franco, the regime admired Nazi Germany and had Spanish archaeologists seek to demonstrate that Spaniards were part of the Aryan race particularly through their Visigothic heritage.\n\nFounder of the Falange Española, José Antonio Primo de Rivera, had little interest in addressing the Jewish problem outside areas of political issues. The Falange's position was influenced by the fact of the small size of the Jewish community in Spain at the time that did not favor the development of strong antisemitism. Primo de Rivera saw the solution to the Jewish problem in Spain as simple: the conversion of Jews to Catholicism. However, on the issue of perceived political tendencies amongst Jews he warned about Jewish-Marxist influences over the working classes. The Falangist daily newspaper \"Arriba\" claimed that \"the Judeo-Masonic International is the creator of two great evils that have afflicted humanity: capitalism and Marxism\". Primo de Rivera approved of attacks by Falangists on the Jewish-owned SEPU department stores in 1935.\n\nThe Spanish Falange and its Hispanic affiliates have promoted the cultural, economic and racial unity of Hispanic peoples across the world in \"\"hispanidad\"\". It has sought to unite Hispanic peoples through proposals to create a commonwealth or federation of Spanish-speaking states headed by Spain.\n\nFalangism supports a national, trans-class society while opposing individual-class-based societies such as bourgeois or proletarian societies. Falangism opposes class conflict. José Antonio Primo de Rivera declared that \"[t]he State is founded on two principles—service to the united nation and the cooperation of classes\".\n\nOriginally, Falangism in Spain as promoted by Primo de Rivera advocated a \"national syndicalist\" economy that rejected both capitalism and communism. Primo de Rivera denounced capitalism for being an individualist economy at the hands of the bourgeoisie that turned workers \"into a dehumanized cog in the machinery of bourgeois production\" while state socialist economies enslaved the individual by handing control of production to the state.\n\nFalange's original manifesto, the \"Twenty-Seven Points\", called for a social revolution to create a national syndicalist economy that creates national syndicates of both employees and employers to mutually organize and control the economic activity, agrarian reform, industrial expansion, and respect for private property with the exception of nationalizing credit facilities to prevent capitalist usury. Under Franco, during the early years of the dictatorship - from the Civil War up to the early 1950s - represented a dramatic rupture with the economic policies prevalent in Spain from the mid-19th century. Effective possession of legislative and judicial powers gave Franco’s dictatorship the ability to alter economic and political rights discretionally. The dictatorship did not reassure economic agents of the New State’s commitment to private property and the free market. Quite the contrary, the new authorities shared a strong anti-market attitude and their economic policy often threatened private initiative and investment. In October 1937, Franco declared national-syndicalism to be fully compatible with capitalism, to the rejoice of the non-falangist right.\n\nFalangism is staunchly anti-communist. The Spanish Falange supported Spanish intervention during World War II against the Soviet Union in the name of anti-communism, resulting in Spain supporting the Anti-Comintern Pact and sending volunteers to join Nazi Germany's foreign legions on the Eastern Front to support the German war effort against the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Spanish Falange supported conservative ideas about women and supported rigid gender roles that stipulated that women's main duties in life were to be a loving mother and a submissive wife. This policy was set against that of the Second Spanish Republic that provided universal suffrage to women.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1871971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1871971", "title": "Burnden Park", "text": "Burnden Park\n\nBurnden Park was the home of English football club Bolton Wanderers who played home games there between 1895 and 1997. As well as hosting the 1901 FA Cup Final replay, it was the scene in 1946 of one of the greatest disasters in English football, and the subject of an L. S. Lowry painting. It was demolished in 1999, two years after Bolton moved to their new home at the Reebok Stadium.\n\nSituated on Manchester Road in the Burnden area of Bolton – less than a mile south of the town centre – the ground served as the home of the town's football team for 102 years.\n\nBolton Wanderers was formed in 1874 as Christ Church FC, with the vicar as club president. After disagreements about the use of church premises, the club broke away and became Bolton Wanderers in 1877 meeting at the Gladstone Hotel. At this time Bolton played at Pike's Lane but needed a purpose built ground to play home matches. As a result, Bolton Wanderers Football and Athletic Club, one of the 12 founder members of the Football League, became a Limited Company in 1894 and shares were raised to build a ground. Land at Burnden was leased at £130 per annum and £4,000 raised to build the stadium. Burnden Park was completed in August 1895. The opening match was a benefit match against Preston and the first League match was against Everton in front of a 15,000 crowd.\n\nThe stadium hosted the replay of the 1901 FA Cup Final, in which Tottenham Hotspur beat Sheffield United 3–1.\n\nThe finals of the Rugby Football League's 1986–87 John Player Special Trophy, and 1988–89 John Player Special Trophy tournaments were played at the ground before crowds of 22,144 and 20,709 respectively. \n\nIn its heyday, Burnden Park could hold crowds of up to 70,000, but this figure was dramatically reduced during the final 20 years of its life, mainly because of new legislation which saw virtually all English stadia reduce their capacities for safety reasons. A section of the embankment was sold off in 1986 to make way for a new Normid superstore. Bolton's attendances were also falling sharply by the 1980s due to the club's declining fortunes on the pitch.\n\nThe club's directors had decided by 1992 that it would be difficult to convert Burnden Park into an all-seater stadium adequate for a club of Bolton's ambition. They were members of the new Division Two (which was known as the Third Division until the creation of the Premier League) but the club wanted to build a stadium to meet these requirements in the event of promotion to Division One and ultimately the Premier League.\n\nThe last ever Wanderers game played at the historic ground was against Charlton Athletic on 25 April 1997. Bolton, who were already promoted as Division One champions, defeated Charlton 4–1 after being 1–0 down at half time. Whites' legend John McGinlay, who scored more than 100 goals in five years with the club, scored the final goal shortly before Bolton received their trophy and the crowd united in singing Auld Lang Syne. \n\nIt was decided to build a new multi million pound 25,000-seater stadium (later raised to nearly 29,000) – the Reebok Stadium – six miles from Burnden Park at the Middlebrook development. The move took place in 1997, bringing an end to 102 years of football at Burnden Park.\n\nOn 9 March 1946, the club's home was the scene of the Burnden Park disaster, which at the time was the worst tragedy in British football history. 33 Bolton Wanderers fans were crushed to death, and another 400 injured, in an FA Cup quarter-final second leg tie between Bolton and Stoke City. There was an estimated 85,000 strong crowd crammed in for the game, at least 15,000 over-capacity. The disaster led to Moelwyn Hughes's official report, which recommended more rigorous control of crowd sizes.\n\nThe railway embankment of Burnden Park was seen in the 1962 film \"A Kind of Loving\", starring Alan Bates and June Ritchie. Part of the Arthur Askey film \"\"The Love Match\"\" was also filmed at Burnden Park in the early 1950s. A painting of Burnden Park in 1953 by L. S. Lowry, \"Going to the Match\", was bought for £1.9 million by the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) in 1999.\n\nFor some years after the stadium's closure, the site suffered. Travellers camped in the car park of the derelict Normid superstore and Burnden Park itself fell into disrepair, with demolition not taking place until two years after the last match had been played. \n\nThere is now an Asda superstore on the site, which opened in 2005 after taking over the Big W. The Asda store identifies itself with Burnden Park by having a number of extremely large photographs of the former stadium and players, placed high above the checkouts. Also on the site are a Co-operative travel, a Subway, a Carphone Warehouse and a Johnson's Cleaners adjacent to Manchester Road. \n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

He served as Archbishop of Utrecht from 1955 to 1975, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1960.\n\nBernardus Alfrink was born in Nijkerk, and received his first Communion in 1911. After attending the seminary in Rijsenburg and the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome, he was ordained to the priesthood on 15 August 1924 by Archbishop Henricus van de Wetering. He then completed his studies at the École Biblique in Jerusalem in 1930, and did pastoral work in Utrecht until 1933. Alfrink taught at the Seminary of Rijsenburg (1933–1945) and later the Catholic University of Nijmegen (1945–1951).\n\nOn 28 May 1951 he was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of Utrecht and Titular Archbishop of \"Tyana\". Alfrink received his episcopal consecration on the following 17 July from Archbishop Paolo Giobbe, papal internuncio in The Hague, with Bishops Willem Lemmens and Jan Smit serving as co-consecrators, in St. Catherine's Cathedral.\n\nAlfrink succeeded Cardinal Johannes de Jong as Archbishop of Utrecht on 31 October 1955 and was named Apostolic vicar of the Catholic Military vicariate of the Netherlands on 16 April 1957. He contributed to scientific publications, led the \"Pax Christi\" movement in the Netherlands, and was created Cardinal-Priest of \"San Gioacchino ai Prati di Castello\" by Pope John XXIII in the consistory of 28 March 1960.\n\nFrom 1962 to 1965, the Dutch primate participated at the Second Vatican Council, and sat on its Board of Presidency. During one session of the Council, Alfrink had Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani's microphone turned off after the latter exceeded his time limit.\n\nAlfrink was one of the cardinal electors in the 1963 papal conclave, which selected Pope Paul VI. Along with Cardinal Giovanni Colombo, he assisted Cardinal Achille Liénart in delivering one of the closing messages of the Council on 8 December 1965.\n\nHe also served as President of the Episcopal Conference of the Netherlands. Resigning as Utrecht's archbishop on 6 December 1975, he later voted in the conclaves of August and October 1978, which selected Popes John Paul I and John Paul II respectively.\n\nHe died in Nieuwegein at age 87, and after his funeral services in St. Catharine's Cathedral, was buried at St. Barbara's cemetery, next to his predecessor.\n\nViewed as a liberal, he once said, \"It is always a good thing for the Church to move forward. It is not good if the Church comes to a standstill.\"\n\nWhile coadjutor, he announced that the Dominican chapel in Huissen, where a large amount of Catholics were going to confession instead of at the local parishes, would be closed to the public, resulting in the dismay and violent reaction of many.\n\nAlfrink supported Edward Schillebeeckx and took his condemnation as an offence to the Dutch Church.\n\nDuring his tenure, Alfrink and his fellow Dutch clergymen attacked the argumentation used in Pope Paul's 1968 encyclical \"Humanae vitae\".\n\nHe refused to respond to the Dutch Reformed Church's call for clarification in regards to Princess Irene's conversion to Catholicism.\n\nIn 1986 he received the Four Freedom Award for the Freedom of Worship\n\nHis father's name was Theodorus, and the priest who baptized him was Johannes Verstege.\n\n"}

The current tournament director is former world No. 2 player Tommy Haas.\n\nThe tournament is a Masters 1000 event on the men's tour and is a Premier Mandatory event on the women's tour. Between 1974 and 1976 it was non-tour event and between 1977 and 1986 it was a secondary tournament of the Grand Prix Tennis Tour but in 1987 it was upgraded to be part of the Grand Prix Super Series, the series of nine tournaments just below the four majors and the year-end finals in importance. It took the place of the Philadelphia Indoor event as the first Super Series event of the year. The event is one of two tour events (along with the Miami Open), other than the Majors, in which main draw play extends beyond eight days. The women's main draw usually starts on Wednesday and the men's main draw starts on Thursday. Both finals are held on Sunday of the following week. Both singles main draws include 96 players in a 128-player grid, with the 32 seeded players getting a bye (a free pass) to the second round.\n\nThe tournament is played on hardcourt and is the best-attended tennis tournament outside the four Grand Slam tournaments. It has the second-largest permanent tennis stadium in the world (the Arthur Ashe Stadium being the largest).\n\nIndian Wells lies in the Coachella Valley (Palm Springs area), about 125 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nThe tournament is played in the Indian Wells Tennis Garden (built in 2000) which has 29 tennis courts, including the 16,100-seat main stadium, which is the Micky Mahbubani second largest tennis-specific stadium in the world. After the 2013 BNP Paribas Open the Indian Wells Tennis Garden started an expansion and upgrade of its facilities that includes a new 8,000 seat Stadium 2.\n\nThe tournament was founded by former tennis pros Charlie Pasarell and Raymond Moore.\n\nOriginally the women's tournament was held a week before the men's event. In 1996, the championship became one of the few fully combined events on both the Association of Tennis Professionals and Women's Tennis Association tours.\n\nThe BNP Paribas Open has become one of the largest events on both men's and women's tour. In 2004 it expanded to a multi-week 96 person field, and since then, it along with the following Miami Open, have been colloquially termed the \"Sunshine Double\". Dubbed the \"Grand Slam of the West\", it is the most-attended tennis tournament in the world other than the four Majors, with over 450,000 visitors during the 2015 event.\n\nIn 2009, the tournament and the Indian Wells Tennis Garden were sold to Larry Ellison.\n\nOn March 8, 2020, the tournament was postponed due to potential spreading of the Covid-19 virus.\n\nVenus and Serena Williams, two very successful American players, refused to play the Indian Wells tournament from 2001 to 2014 despite threats of financial sanctions and ranking point penalties. The two were scheduled to play in the 2001 semifinal but Venus withdrew due to an injury. Amid speculation of match fixing, the crowd for the final loudly booed Serena when she came out to play the final and continued to boo her intermittently through the entire match, even to the point of cheering unforced errors and double faults. Williams won the tournament and was subsequently booed during the awards ceremony. The following month at the Ericsson Open, Richard Williams, Serena and Venus's father, claimed racial slurs were directed at him while in the stands. Neither Venus nor Serena played the tournament until 2015, when Serena Williams played in the tournament, ending her 14-year boycott of the event.

Since the late 19th century, it has been an important railway junction between České Budějovice, Tábor, Třeboň and Jindřichův Hradec. The railway station remains one of the biggest local employers. The sand, concrete and food industries are also long-established in the town.\n\nThe town was first mentioned in 1259 as a hamlet and a redoubt on the salt road from Austria to Prague. Emperor Charles IV gave it the status of a town in 1362. In the 15th century, the town saw many fires and was looted by the Hussites. It was Petr Vok from the House of Rosenberg, a famous fish pond founder and supporter, who let the town grow again a hundred years later. The Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) damaged the town badly again - with only about 50 people remaining. New development came with the in the second half of the 17th century.

He authored many books on atheism and proposed atheism as self-confidence. He propagated positive atheism by his articles, speeches, books and his social work. He is the founder of Atheist Centre along with his wife Saraswathi Gora and a few volunteers.\n\nGora was born on 15 November 1902, into an orthodox Telugu Brahmin family in Chhatrapur, Odisha, India. He pursued a botany degree, eventually earning his Master's in botany at Presidency College in Madras. He married Saraswathi Gora in 1922, when she was only 10. He taught botany at various institutes at Madurai, Coimbatore, Colombo and Kakinada, for fifteen years.\n\nGora started his activism against superstition in the 1920s. He and his wife publicly viewed solar eclipses, as there was a superstitious belief that pregnant women should not do so. They stayed in haunted houses to dispel the myths about such places.\n\nGora used to run a monthly programme called \"cosmopolitan dinners\" every full moon night, where people of all castes and religions gathered together. Gora insisted on staying in a Harijan locality whenever he was invited to address a village. He also conducted several inter-caste and inter-religious marriages. One of his own sons and daughters married spouses from untouchable castes.\n\nIn 1933, he was dismissed from the PR College in Kakinada for his atheist views. In 1939, he was dismissed from the Hindu College in Machilipatnam for the same reason.\n\nIn 1940, after his dismissal, he and his wife founded the Atheist Centre, in a small village called Mudunur in the Krishna district. The Atheist Centre was (and is) heavily involved in social reforms. On the eve of Independence in 1947, they moved the Atheist centre to Vijayawada. In 1941, he published his first book on atheism in Telugu, \"Atheism: There is no god\" (Telugu: \"Nasthikatvamu: Devudu ledu\").\n\nThroughout the 1940s, he worked in the Indian independence movement. In 1942, Gora along with his wife and eldest son were arrested during the Quit India Movement. Their 18-month son had to accompany his mother to the Royavellor jail.\n\nGora and Gandhi had several discussions, some of which have been recorded in the book \"An Atheist With Gandhi\". When Gandhi asked him to differentiate between atheism and godlessness Gora replied, Gandhi supported Gora's anti-untouchability reform movement, and remarked that he wished Gora would succeed in producing a Tuskegee in India. Tuskegee in Alabama, United States, is an important site in Africa American history where Booker T. Washington established the Tuskegee University.\n\nIn 1952, he contested in the parliamentary elections to propagate his idea of party-less democracy. In 1967, he also contested in the assembly polls.\n\nGora visited several nations in 1970 and 1974. He was in touch with the American atheist, Madalyn Murray O'Hair. On 5 October 1970, O'Hair mentioned Gora and his Atheist Center on her radio show. In 1970, when Gora stopped in United States during his tour, he met O'Hair. They decided that a World Atheist Conference should be held every three years. Gora offered to host the first one in 1972. O'Hair was not able to attend as her visa was not approved in time. The first World Atheist Conference was held on 1972. After the event, Gora published a book in English called \"Positive Atheism\".\n\nGora first organized Beef and Pork Friendship party in Vijayawada on 15 August 1972, the Silver Jubilee of Indian Independence, there was big commotion and opposition. True to his principles, Gora urged for voluntary participation. Puri Shakaracharya and some orthodox people violently opposed and threatened to disrupt the function. When the matter went up to the Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, The government reacted positively and provided police protection. Thousands of people gathered, to witness the beef and pork party. Gora and Saraswathi Gora, who headed the programme, made it clear that it was meant to bring social cohesion. Participants were asked to sign in a register. Among the hundreds of gatherers, 138 people came forward and ate beef and pork together. They included atheists, and even orthodox Hindus, Muslims and Christians. When similar programme was held at Coimbatore, Periyar EV Ramaswami and Gora participated. In various places including Visakhapatnam, Gudivada and Suryapet, Beef and Pork programmes were held.\n\nGora had nine children. Gora got his eldest daughter, Manorama, married to Arjuna Rao, who belonged to the Dalit community In 1949. The marriage was held in Sevagram, in presence of Jawaharlal Nehru. The marriage of his eldest son, Lavanam, with Hemalata, the daughter of Gurram Jashuva, was also held in Sevagram In 1960. His eldest son was an atheist and Gandhian Lavanam, daughter Mythri and another son Vijayam, continued to organise the World Atheist Conference. Mythri chairperson of Atheist Centre and Vijayam is the current executive director of the Atheist Centre. The physician Samaram Goparaju is his son.\n\nHis daughter, Chennupati Vidya, is a social worker. She was elected to the Lok Sabha, of the Parliament of India, in 1980 and 1989.\n\nGora supported partyless democracy.\n\nGora was a Gandhian and believed in Sarvodaya (progress of all). He rejected historical materialism and considered Marxism a 'fatalist philosophy'.\n\nHe believed that atheism allows a person to surpass the barriers of castes and religions. It allows a person to understand that his/her actions are directed by free will and not Karma, fate or divine will. This in turn would allow Harijans to be liberated, as they would no longer believe that they are fated to be untouchable.\n\nGora died on 26 July 1975 in Vijayawada. His autobiography, completed a few days before his death, was published in 1976. The Atheist Centre continued under the guidance of Saraswathi Gora, until her death in 2006 on 19 August.\n\nIn 2002, India Post, the postal department of the Government of India, released a postage stamp of five rupee denomination commemorating Gora's birth centenary.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1990 as Wunsch Auction Systems by R. Steven Wunsch, and moved from New York City to Arizona in 1992. It closed in October 2001 due to lack of trading volume.\n\nThe exchange was founded in 1990 as Wunsch Auction Systems by R. Steven Wunsch, formerly of Kidder Peabody. The computers were based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with the headquarters in New York City. The technology trading center in Minnesota was built and run by a group of former Cray Research Supercomputer technologists that included Christopher Moran, Gray Lorig, Kerry Yndestad and Paul Sustman. Due to the exchange's low trading volume and small size, the Securities and Exchange Commission exempted Wunsch and the exchange from regulations, and it went unregistered. The system was an electronic auction for online trading of NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stocks for after-hours trades. The system was not intended for individual investors, but rather large trader entities.\n\nIt got off to a \"slow start\" on Wall Street as a computerized stock trading systems that bypassed \"traditional\" exchange systems. The company was fought by the New York Stock Exchange. As of December 25, 1991, the exchange allowed about 3,100 stocks to be traded during a day, and the system had 56 customers that were institutions. It also had smaller activity than it needed, with Wunsch saying it needed about 24 customers a day placing orders to attract steady business, while it regularly had no more than a dozen customers per day place orders.\n\nAs of 1991, it offered two auctions each day, one taking place a half-hour before the opening of the NYSE, and the other a half-hour after the NYSE closed. The exchange sought to connect bidders and sellers with set desired trade prices, with investors able to go to the other exchanges, either NYSE or regional, if no match was found. Over six months in 1991, Wunsch signed about four dozen institutional investors, with the \"New York Times\" describing the project as \"the nation's first electronic stock-trading network to be designated a bona fide stock exchange by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\" It was not the first electronic exchange, but it was the first one set up to directly compete with traditional stock exchanges via price \"discovery\" in a bidding process. Traditional exchanges \"cried foul\" over the new exchange, according to the \"New York Times,\" with regulators being asked to reconsider what \"constitutes a stock exchange.\" It was worried that although the new exchange had a tiny amount of business, it \"theoretically could supplant the Big Board for the large institutional investors.\" Officials at the NYSE and other exchange argued that the best, easiest trades would be \"cherrypicked\" by the new exchange. Also, it \"threatens to undermine\" the NYSE's role as the price setter for corporate shares, according to the \"New York Times.\" Later in 1991, 125 institutional investors had signed on.\n\nIn June 1991, the governor of Arizona signed legislation for the state to establish a stock exchange. In December 1991, the state of Arizona approved of Wunsch moving his online electronic auction to Phoenix, Arizona from Wall Street and rename it the Arizona Stock Exchange, or AZX. Formerly Wunsch Auction Systems, Inc. it was later operated by AZX, Inc. Arizona received up to $2 million in loans from Arizona, as well as promotion, to serve as incentive for moving to the state. Although Wuncsch asserted that the new exchange was not another regional stock market, Arizona officials said they hoped local small and medium companies would gain exposure. It was said the office in Arizona would become active in February 1992. Trading commenced on March 30, 1992.\n\nIn April 2001, the SEC granted the Arizona Stock Exchange permission to hold one of its 30-minute live auctions when the markets opened. The exchange auctioned online stocks as though they were antiques or art. Previously, the exchange had only been able to operate on off-hours for a number of reasons, and hadn't been \"introduced in a full-form way.\" Support for the new time slot for the auction came from companies such as Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Credit Suisse, First Boston and Instinet. The auction's founder and president was Steven Wunsch.\nWhile the idea behind AZX was ahead of its time in the 1990s and anticipated the more successful electronic communication networks such as Archipelago, it closed in October 2001 primarily due to lack of volume.\n\nRestricted to use by large institutional users only, participants could conduct screen-based trades of equity and other products through either direct dial-up or internet access. The Arizona Stock Exchange was structured as a proprietary \"Single Price\" electronic call market. Unique to the Arizona Stock Exchange was the ability to discover the best or \"single\" price for a stock during the auction based upon supply and demand utilizing both an open book and reserve book of equity orders. Operating under a \"de minimis\" exemption, it was not required to be registered or regulated as a stock exchange with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe general philosophy behind the Arizona Stock Exchange was to let natural buyers and sellers of equities trade directly with one another without intermediation by a broker or dealer. The AZX sought to reduce transaction costs for its participants, remove volatility from the market and determine more robust and fair pricing for equities traded.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1872049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872049", "title": "Mark Harper", "text": "Mark Harper\n\nMark James Harper (born 26 February 1970) is a British Conservative Party politician who has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Forest of Dean constituency since 2005. He has previously served as a junior minister in the Cabinet Office, Immigration Minister and Minister for Disabled People. He was the Government Chief Whip in the House of Commons from May 2015 to July 2016, before being sacked by incoming Prime Minister Theresa May in 2016. Harper was a candidate for Leader of the Conservative Party in the 2019 leadership contest.\n\nHarper was born in Swindon and studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Brasenose College, Oxford. He was a chartered accountant before his election to Parliament.\n\nHarper was born in Swindon, Wiltshire, and educated at the Headlands Comprehensive School and Swindon College. He read Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Brasenose College, Oxford where he studied under Professor Vernon Bogdanor.\n\nUpon graduation in 1991, Harper joined KPMG as an auditor. After qualifying as a chartered accountant, he joined Intel Corporation. In 2002, he left Intel to set up his own accountancy practice.\n\nPrior to entering Parliament, Harper was the treasurer of the Swindon Conservative Association and served as Vice-Chairman for a year in 1998.\n\nHe contested the Gloucestershire seat of Forest of Dean at the 2001 general election, but was defeated by the sitting Labour MP Diana Organ. Organ retired at the 2005 general election and Harper gained the seat for the Conservatives with a majority of 2,049 votes; which was the same number of votes by which he was defeated at the previous election. At the same general election, Harper's wife, Margaret, stood for election as the Conservative candidate in Worcester, where she finished in a close second place to the Labour candidate, Michael Foster.\n\nAt the 2010 general election, Harper increased his majority to more than 11,000 votes. At the 2015 general election, his majority decreased by 77 votes.\n\nOn 24 May 2005, Harper made his maiden speech, in which he advocated giving the parents of children with special educational needs the option of sending their children to a non-mainstream school – an issue of local interest in Harper's Gloucestershire seat and one close to the heart of the then Shadow Education Secretary, David Cameron, whose son Ivan was born with severe learning difficulties. When Cameron was elected leader of the party in December 2005, he made Harper a spokesman on armed forces welfare issues and veterans.\n\nHarper has sat on the Commons Administration Committee and briefly on the Work and Pensions Committee. On matters of foreign policy, he has consistently voted in support of British military intervention overseas. Harper was described in 2015 as a Eurosceptic. Even so, he campaigned to remain in the European Union during the 2016 referendum on ending the UK's membership.\n\nThe scandal over MPs' expenses showed Harper to be a frugal parliamentarian: his only significant expenses claim was for a brief period of temporary accommodation occupied on a short-term basis soon after being elected in 2005.\n\nIn the reshuffle of July 2007, Harper was made Shadow Minister for Disabled People – a position he held until the general election in 2010.\n\nSoon after the general election in 2010, Harper became Under Secretary of State for Political and Constitutional Reform in the Cabinet Office. There he worked with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg on the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 that would offer the electorate a switch from 'first-past-the-post' to the Alternative Vote system for electing MPs (Harper was not enthusiastic about the proposal, which had been a key bargaining chip in the Coalition negotiations in May 2010). The Act also aimed to change the shapes of parliamentary constituencies and introduce fixed-term parliaments. On 5 May 2011, the referendum was held and voters rejected the proposed switch to the Alternative Vote system. Fixed-term parliaments became law later that year in a separate Act but the changes to constituency boundaries, which would have been advantageous to the Tories, never materialised.\n\nIn October 2010, the Government introduced the Public Bodies Bill to the House of Lords, which would allow it to sell or lease public forests in England. Harper defended the proposals, describing them as an \"exciting opportunity for community ownership.\" However, they were widely criticised by many residents within his Forest of Dean constituency and by politicians with connections to the large oak forest after which Harper's parliamentary seat is named – including Baroness Jan Royall, Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords. Following a public meeting – after which Harper had to be rescued by the police from what he described as \"a baying mob\" – and a sustained national campaign which included the newly formed local Forest of Dean pressure group Hands off our Forest, the government announced it had abandoned its plans and would remove the forestry clauses from the Public Bodies Bill.\n\nHarper worked on the House of Lords Reform Bill, which set out to introduce a smaller second chamber consisting mostly of elected peers. This was a Liberal Democrat policy that had also been mentioned as an aspiration in the Conservative Party's manifesto of 2010. In July 2012, 91 Conservative MPs defied the whips and voted with Labour against the proposals, something which led the Coalition Government to abandon the planned reform soon afterwards.\n\nIn the reshuffle of September 2012, Harper was promoted to Minister of State for Immigration at a time when levels of inward migration were falling but emigration rates were falling faster still, leading to a rise in net migration into the UK.\n\nOver the summer of 2013, Harper trialled a campaign aimed at illegal immigrants that consisted, in part, of lorries with hoardings attached to their load areas driving around London displaying the sign \"Here Illegally? Go Home or Risk Arrest\" with more information in smaller print on how to contact the Home Office for advice. The scheme was seen as offensive by some and it divided opinion within the Coalition's ministerial team. In October 2013, Harper told MPs: \"The advertising vans in particular were too much of a blunt instrument and will not be used again\".\n\nHarper resigned as immigration minister on 8 February 2014, after he discovered that his self-employed cleaner did not have permission to work in the UK. In his resignation letter, Harper stated that he first made checks on his cleaner in 2007 and \"considered the issue again\" when appointed a minister in the Cabinet Office in 2010 and immigration minister in September 2012 but had concluded that \"no further check was necessary\". After launching a campaign to get employers and landlords to carry out \"reasonable checks\" on workers, Harper said that he thought it prudent to check the documents again, but could not locate them, and asked his cleaner for new copies. When his private office checked the details with immigration officials, it was found she did not have indefinite leave to stay in the UK. He immediately told Home Secretary Theresa May, and then after notifying Prime Minister David Cameron, he resigned. He was replaced by James Brokenshire.\n\nThe ministerial reshuffle in July 2014 saw Harper restored to office in the role of Minister for Disabled People at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). He took over responsibility for the relatively new Personal Independence Payment (PIP), as well as for the dysfunctional Work Capability Assessment (WCA) used to assess entitlement to Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) - a legacy of New Labour. Both operations were plagued by large backlogs of unassessed claims.\n\nIn October of that year, the Office for Budget Responsibility disclosed that Harper's department had failed to make the anticipated £3 billion annual saving in incapacity benefits spending expected by 2014 (the DWP achieved no saving at all from this budget over the whole of the 2010–15 parliamentary term).\n\nHarper attracted media attention and accusations of hypocrisy in late-2014 when, as Minister for Disabled People, he called for businesses to improve disabled access. Newspapers were quick to report the fact that his own constituency office did not have proper disabled access.\n\nIn January 2015, Harper appeared before the Work and Pensions Select Committee to face questions over the problems with PIP. A former senior civil servant appointed by the DWP to review PIP had found the scheme beset by \"delays and backlogs\" and had described the process, which was introduced by another minister in April 2013, as still representing \"a major delivery challenge.\" Macmillan benefits advisers had told the reviewer that people had died while waiting for their PIP claim to be processed. The MS Society described these delays as unacceptable and some charities called for the PIP scheme to be halted.\n\nIn February 2015, Harper was interviewed by the BBC about David Cameron's request to Professor Dame Carol Black that she advise him on whether withholding ESA claimants' benefits if they were obese or addicted to alcohol or drugs would encourage them to undergo further treatment. Harper described this approach as \"a very sensible move on the part of the Prime Minister\". The idea met resistance from the medical profession and nothing came of it.\n\nIn March 2015, the US firm Maximus began carrying out WCAs in place of Atos under a completely new contract that would cost almost £600 million and run until late 2018. There was initial optimism within Whitehall that a new contract and a new provider would mean the start of a new chapter in fit-for-work assessment, although two House of Commons select committees - the Work and Pensions Committee and the Public Accounts Committee - had between them concluded that the DWP's policies, its operational decisions and its failure to monitor Atos adequately were to blame for many of the assessment's earlier failings. A review by the National Audit Office of the performance of the new contract in its first year was sceptical about its value for money, although the WCA backlog had been virtually eliminated by the spring of 2016.\n\nBy the time he left the DWP, Harper had brought about a substantial reduction in the size of the backlog of PIP claims as well. This was achieved by: drafting in hundreds more DWP decision-makers; assessing more claims on the basis of the documents supplied by claimants, rather than through more time-consuming face-to-face assessments; changing the way that waiting times were measured; and streamlining the whole end-to-end process.\n\nHarper was promoted to Chief Whip after the Conservative general election victory in May 2015.\n\nIn October 2015, the right-of-centre political website ConservativeHome tipped Harper to replace Iain Duncan Smith at the Department for Work and Pensions or become Energy and Climate Change Secretary over the medium term.\n\nIn December 2015, after a vote in favour of using Britain's military capabilities against the self-styled Islamic State in Syria, the \"London Evening Standard\" reported that: \"David Cameron dashed to the Government whips' office to congratulate Chief Whip Mark Harper following the Commons vote on the war, which saw MPs back action after a 10-hour debate\".\n\nIn July 2017, when Theresa May pledged to repeal the Hunting Act 2004 which would allow fox hunting to be legalised, Harper stood by his belief that the Act should be repealed. He said: \"If we were faced with the same pledge as last time I would vote to repeal the Act, I did not agree with it being banned and I am not opposed to hunting. I don't see any problem with it. That is consistent with the position I have taken at each election.\"\n\nHarper in 2016 campaigned for Remain in the EU referendum.\n\n"}

{"id": "1872056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872056", "title": "Court of Appeals of Virginia", "text": "Court of Appeals of Virginia\n\nThe Court of Appeals of Virginia, established January 1, 1985, is an eleven-judge body that hears appeals from decisions of Virginia's circuit courts and the Virginia Workers' Compensation Commission. The Court sits in panels of at least three judges, and sometimes hears cases en banc. Appeals from the Court of Appeals go to the Supreme Court of Virginia.\n\nThe need for expanded appellate capacity was first recognized in 1971. The report of the Virginia Court System Study Commission, composed of distinguished legislators and members of the bench and bar, recommended a reorganization plan for a unified court system. The Commission, chaired by former Chief Justice Lawrence W. I'Anson, recognized the need for an intermediate appellate court in Virginia which would absorb the bulk of review of circuit court appeals, while preserving the Supreme Court as a single body concentrating on the development of the law.\n\nIn 1978, a comprehensive study of the Virginia court system conducted by the National Center for State Courts also recommended that the appellate capacity of the Virginia courts be increased by creating an intermediate Court of Appeals. In 1982, the Judicial Council of Virginia proposed legislation for a twelve judge intermediate appellate court. Finally, in 1983, the General Assembly created the Court of Appeals of Virginia, effective January 1, 1985. E. Ballard Baker was the first chief judge of the Court of Appeals of Virginia.\n\nSince the establishment of the Court of Appeals, appellate capacity has increased 38.8%. The number petitions acted upon has risen each year, achieving the desired goal of increasing appellate capacity in the court system.\n\nThe Court of Appeals consists of eleven judges who are elected for eight year terms by a majority of the members of each house of the General Assembly. If a vacancy occurs while the General Assembly is not in session, the Governor may appoint a successor to serve until thirty days after the commencement of the next session of the legislature.\n\nThe chief judge of the Court of Appeals is elected by a majority vote of the judges of the Court of Appeals to serve a term of four years. The Chief Judge designates where the Court of Appeals will sit in order to provide convenient access to the citizens of the various geographic areas of the state. The Court normally sits in four locations: Alexandria, Chesapeake, Richmond and Salem.\n\nThe clerk of the Court of Appeals receives, processes and maintains permanent records of appeals and other official documents filed with the Court.\n\nThe Court of Appeals sits en banc (or as a whole) in the following circumstances: \n\nUnder these conditions, the Court of Appeals convenes en banc and reconsiders the case. The court sitting en banc may override any previous decision of a panel or the full Court. No fewer than eight judges may be present when Court of Appeals sits en banc.\n\n\"The Court of Appeals has authority to hear appeals as a matter of right from:\" \n\n\"The Court of Appeals has authority to consider petitions for appeal from:\" \nThe Court of Appeals has original jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus, prohibition and habeas corpus in any case over which the Court would have appellate jurisdiction.\n\nIn addition, the Court of Appeals has original jurisdiction to issue a writ of actual innocence upon petition of a person who has been convicted of a felony upon a plea of not guilty.\n\nAll criminal cases that are within the Court's jurisdiction and all traffic infraction cases are presented to the Court by petition for appeal. A petition is a formal written application to a court requesting judicial action on a certain matter.\n\nEach petition for appeal in a criminal case is referred to a judge of the Court for review to determine if an appeal should be awarded. The judge may grant the petition for appeal in whole or part. An appellant may request a panel of three judges of the Court of Appeals to review a petition for appeal that was denied, either in whole, or part, by the judge who initially reviewed the petition. As long as oral argument was preserved in the petition for appeal and a reply brief was not filed, the appellant may present oral argument on the petition for appeal before a panel of three judges. Any one of the three judges may grant the petition on the basis of the record without oral argument. If the petition is granted, briefs are filed by both parties. The clerk of the Court of Appeals refers each granted appeal to a panel of the Court. Oral argument is permitted and may be waived.\n\nAll other appeals (domestic relations, Virginia Workers' Compensation Commission and those from administrative agencies) are heard as a matter of right. Appeals of right are cases that an appellate court is required to hear. These cases do not go through the petition process. Briefs are filed by both parties and the case is referred by the clerk of the Court to a panel of three judges. Oral argument is permitted and may be waived. The Court may summarily affirm an appeal without oral argument if a panel of three judges determines that it has no merit.\n\nDecisions are issued by the Court of Appeals by written opinion or order.\n\nIn any case in which an appeal has been taken to the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court may certify the case for review by the Supreme Court before it has been determined by the Court of Appeals. Such certification transfers jurisdiction over the case to the Supreme Court for all purposes. These certifications occur only when the case is of such public importance to require prompt decision by the Supreme Court or when the docket of the Court of Appeals is congested and expeditious administration of justice requires the transfer.\n\nWhen the Court of Appeals has rejected a petition for appeal, dismissed an appeal, or decided on an appeal, its decision is final, without appeal to the Supreme Court in the following cases:\n\n\nNotwithstanding the finality of these cases, if the Supreme Court determines on a petition for review that the decision of the Court of Appeals involves a substantial constitutional question as a determinative issue or matters of significant precedential value, review may be had in the Supreme Court.\n\nExcept where the decisions of the Court of Appeals are final, any party aggrieved by a final decision of the Court of Appeals may petition the Supreme Court for an appeal.\n\n"}

As part of Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Goodfellow's main mission is cryptologic and intelligence training for the Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Navy, and Marine Corps. Military firefighters are also trained here as part of the 312th Training Squadron. It is the home of the 17th Training Wing (17 TRW). The base is named for World War I aviator First Lieutenant John J. Goodfellow, Jr.\n\nGoodfellow's history traces to the days before the attack on Pearl Harbor, but its name registered the valor and sacrifice of an earlier conflict. On 14 September 1918, 1st Lieutenant John J. Goodfellow, Jr., of San Angelo, Texas, boarded his Salmson 2A2 observation plane at Gondreville Airfield in France to conduct visual reconnaissance behind enemy lines. The mission was part of a larger undertaking just underway, a major American offensive intended to reduce the German salient near Saint-Mihiel. Unfortunately, adverse weather permitted observation only at a low altitude that exposed the lumbering Salmson to enemy pursuit. Three days later, the offensive a success, the young pilot's remains were recovered from his ruined craft and interred at the St. Mihiel American Cemetery and Memorial near Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle.\n\nThe peace that arrived two months later endured a mere two decades more. Constrained by neutrality legislation, but witness to the aggression across Europe, Africa, and Asia, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt began a program of preparedness which included the construction of facilities dedicated to advanced air training. Several such bases were envisioned for Texas and one, specifically, for the Fort Worth-Midland-San Angelo triangle. Civic leaders from San Angelo immediately commended their community to the U.S. War Department. A generous offer of sewage and electrical service, a railroad spur, and a 50-year lease on at one dollar per year easily decided the issue.\n\nConstruction of the new San Angelo Air Corps Basic Flying School began at once. Officially established on 17 August 1940, the base was ready for occupancy by 21 January 1941, and the first classes of students soon arrived. On 11 June 1941, in dedication to a young hero and in tribute to the community that shaped him, the base was officially renamed Goodfellow Field.\n\nIn the next four years, more than 10,000 trained pilots were graduated, and many were decorated for outstanding heroism in action against Germany, Italy, and Japan.\n\nStill, the Axis collapse did not dissolve the Goodfellow mission. Goodfellow continued to train pilots into the postwar era, primarily for large multiengine piston and turboprop aircraft, first on the AT-6 Texan, the T-28 Trojan, and then, beginning in 1954, on the twin-engine TB-25 and B-25 Mitchell. On 3 September 1958, with nearly 20,000 aviators to its credit, Goodfellow graduated its last class of pilots, as the Air Force and Air Training Command (ATC) transitioned to the new Undergraduate Pilot Training construct with T-37 and T-38 Talon aircraft that required minimum 8000-ft (2400-m) runway lengths, far longer than Goodfellow's 5500-ft primary runways.\n\nWith the transfer of the base from ATC to the USAF Security Service (USAFSS), Goodfellow's mission became the training of Air Force personnel in the advanced cryptologic skills that the Security Service required. Eight years later, in 1966, the mission expanded further to include joint-service training in these same skills for U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps personnel.\n\nAlthough flight operations at Goodfellow decreased dramatically after 1958, minimal activities continued with both transient aircraft and locally based Cessna U-3 Administrators (1958–1971), DeHavilland U-6 Beavers (1960–1966), Piasecki H-21, CH-21 and HH-21 Workhorse helicopters (1958–1966) and Cessna O-2 Skymasters (1972–1975). Goodfellow's runways were permanently closed in March 1975.\n\nAfter 38 years of pilot and then intelligence training, Goodfellow's mission had apparently come to a close with the announcement in 1978 that the base would revert to ATC and was a candidate for closure. Since Goodfellow was a single-mission facility, its mission could perhaps be executed more economically elsewhere.\n\nBy then, senior intelligence personnel had already begun seriously to contemplate the consolidation of all Air Force-managed intelligence training at one location. The site selected for intelligence training consolidation was Goodfellow, and the base was designated a technical training center on 1 March 1985.\n\nDuring the next three years, intelligence training consolidation brought to Goodfellow advanced imagery training from Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska; electronic intelligence operations training from Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi; and targeting, intelligence applications, and general intelligence training from Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado, as a result of Lowry's identification for closure under Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC). The successful completion of intelligence training consolidation on 30 June 1988 further facilitated the development of intelligence training integration, a multidisciplinary approach to the training of intelligence professionals.\n\nIn 1992, as part of an overall organizational restructuring of the Air Force, ATC was inactivated, replaced by the Air Education and Training Command (AETC), which became the \"parent\" major command for Goodfellow AFB.\n\nOn 1 July 1993, the 17th Training Wing was activated on Goodfellow AFB. With the change in name came a marked diversification and increase in Goodfellow's mission. Rounds one and two of the BRAC process transferred special instruments training from the former Lowry AFB and fire protection training from the former Chanute Air Force Base, Illinois, to Goodfellow. To support the increased training load, Goodfellow underwent extensive modernization and growth. With new training facilities, dormitories, dining halls, a commissary, a youth center, and a physical fitness center.\n\nOn February 18, 1995 Louis Jones, Jr. kidnapped private Tracie Joy McBride from Goodfellow AFB before raping and murdering her.\n\nFlying and notable non-flying units based at Goodfellow Air Force Base.\n\nUnits marked GSU are Geographically Separate Units, which although based at Goodfellow, are subordinate to a parent unit based at another location.\nAir Education and Training Command (AETC)\n\n\nTraining and Doctrine Command\n\n\n\n\nNaval Education and Training Command\n\n\nThese are some of the facilities at Goodfellow AFB:\n\n\n\n"}

Shapps also has Cabinet responsibility for the Northern Powerhouse. A member of the Conservative Party, he has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Welwyn Hatfield since the 2005 general election. He served as Chairman of the Conservative Party from 2012 to 2015, also holding the title of Minister without Portfolio in the Cabinet Office. His salary was paid by the party.\n\nFollowing the 2010 general election, he was appointed Minister of State for Housing and Local Government; the following 9 June, Shapps was appointed as a Privy Counsellor. On 11 May 2015, he resigned as party chairman after his appointment as Minister of State for International Development. On 28 November 2015, he stood down from his ministerial position due to allegations of bullying within the Conservative Party.\n\nShapps was born in Croxley Green, Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, to a Jewish family. He was educated at Yorke Mead Primary School, Watford Grammar School for Boys and Cassio College. He completed a business and finance course at Manchester Polytechnic, and received a Higher National Diploma.\nShapps was also National President of the Jewish youth organisation BBYO. In 1989, according to Shapps, he was in a car crash in Kansas, United States, that left him in a coma for a week.\n\nHe married Belinda Goldstone in 1997 and they have three children. In 1999 Shapps was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma and underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy recovering from cancer by the following year. As a result of the effects of chemotherapy, his children were conceived by IVF.\n\nShapps's brother, Andre Shapps, is a musician who was a member of Big Audio Dynamite (BAD) between 1994 and 1998, playing keyboards. Their cousin Mick Jones was a key figure in British punk rock of the late 1970s, and a founding member of both the Clash and Big Audio Dynamite.\n\nIn 1990, aged 22, Shapps founded PrintHouse Corporation, a design, print, website creation and marketing business in London, based on a collapsed printing business he purchased from the receiver. He stepped down as a director in 2009, but remained the majority shareholder.\n\nShapps founded a web publishing business, How To Corp Limited, with his wife while he was recovering from cancer. The company marketed business publications and software. Shapps stood down as a director in July 2008; his wife remained as director until the company was dissolved in 2014.\n\nIn 2012, Google blacklisted 19 of the Shapps's business websites for violating rules on copyright infringement related to the web scraping-based TrafficPayMaster software sold by them. Shapps's web marketing business's 20/20 Challenge publication also drew criticism. It cost $497 and promised customers earnings of $20,000 in 20 days. Upon purchase, the \"toolkit\" was revealed to be an ebook, advising the user to create their own toolkit and recruit 100 \"Joint Venture Partners\" to resell it for a share of the profits.\n\nIn 1994, Shapps stood as a Conservative candidate for the two-member St Andrews ward in the London Borough of Brent local elections, but was unsuccessful in being returned as a councillor, with Labour narrowly holding both seats. Shapps previously used the name \"Grant V. Shapps\" in the 2001 and 2005 elections, despite not having a middle name on his birth or marriage certificates.\n\nShapps unsuccessfully contested the seat of North Southwark and Bermondsey during the 1997 election as the Conservative Party candidate.\n\nShapps stood for the Welwyn Hatfield constituency in the 2001 election, again unsuccessfully. He was reselected to fight Welwyn Hatfield in 2002 and continued his local campaigning over the next four years.\n\nShapps stood again in the 2005 election and was elected as the Conservative MP for Welwyn Hatfield, defeating the Labour MP and Minister for Public Health, Melanie Johnson. He received 22,172 votes (49.6%) and had a majority of 5,946 (13.3%), recording the second highest swing from Labour to Conservative in the 2005 election of 8.2%.\n\nShapps publicly backed David Cameron's bid for the leadership of the Conservative Party, seconding Cameron's nomination papers. Upon Cameron's election as party leader Shapps was appointed vice chairman of the Conservative Party with responsibility for campaigning.\n\nHe was a member of the Public Administration Select Committee between May 2005 and February 2007.\n\nAt the 2010 general election he was re-elected with an 11.1% swing and a majority of 17,423, taking 57% of the vote.\n\nShapps was opposed to the UK's withdrawal from the European Union prior to the 2016 referendum.\n\nIn June 2007, Shapps became shadow housing minister, outside the shadow cabinet, but entitled to attend its meetings.\n\nHe was shadow housing minister during the period of the last four Labour government housing ministers. During this period of opposition he argued in favour of a community-up approach to solving the housing crisis and warned against top-down Whitehall driven housing targets, which he believed had failed in the past.\n\nIn April 2009, Shapps launched the Conservative party's ninth green paper on policy, \"Strong Foundations\". In early 2010 Shapps published a series of six speeches in a pamphlet called \"Home Truths\".\n\nIn May 2010, Shapps became housing and local government minister within the Communities and Local Government department and immediately repealed Home Information Pack (HIP) legislation. He chaired the Cross-Ministerial Working Group on Homelessness which includes ministers from eight Government departments. The group introduced \"No Second Night Out\", a policy designed to prevent rough sleeping nationwide.\n\nAs Minister of State for Housing, Shapps promoted plans for flexible rent and controversially ended automatic lifetime social tenancies. He also introduced the New Homes Bonus which rewarded councils for building more homes. He denied claims that changes in Housing Benefit rules would be unfair claiming that ordinary people could no longer afford some of the homes paid for by the £24bn Housing Benefit bill. Shapps championed Tenant Panels.\n\nAt the 2011 party conference, Shapps backed the expansion of right to buy with the income being spent on replacing the sold housing with new affordable housing on a one for one basis.\n\nIn 2012, Shapps launched StreetLink – a website and phone app for the public to bring help to rough sleepers.\n\nIn September 2012, Shapps was appointed Co-Chairman of the Conservative Party in Cameron's first major reshuffle. On arrival Shapps set about preparing Conservative Campaign Headquarters for the 2015 election by installing an election countdown clock. That November, Shapps hired political strategist Lynton Crosby to provide strategic advice and run the 2015 election campaign.\n\nIn March 2013, Shapps defended the Welfare Reform Act 2012 (often referred to as the \"Bedroom Tax\") saying his own children share a bedroom. That September, Shapps complained to the Secretary-General of the United Nations about a press release issued in its name stating that the reforms went against human rights. Also in 2013, Shapps speaking on benefit reforms including capping benefits so that no out-of-work household can claim more than the average working family earns said that \"\"nearly a million people have come off incapacity benefit... before going for the test. They've taken themselves off. My big argument here is this is not these people were trying to play the system, as much as these people were forced into a system that played them\".\" His statement was criticised by Andrew Dilnot, Chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, who noted that the figure for those previously on incapacity and withdrawing was just 19,700.. The other 878,300 not on benefits consisted of a drop in new claimants of the ESA.\n\nIn October 2013, Shapps told \"The Daily Telegraph\" that the BBC could forfeit the right to its licence fee if it did not resolve its \"culture of waste and secrecy\". He also suggested that the organisation was biased against the Conservative Party, saying it did not \"apply fairness in both directions\" and that there was a \"question of credibility for the organisation\". His comments sparked a vigorous response from a former BBC Director General Greg Dyke who said that \"politicians shouldn't define partiality\". Others, including the current BBC Director General Tony Hall echoed some of Shapps's comments by saying that the \"BBC needs to start treating public money as its own.\"\n\nIn March 2014, Shapps tweeted support of the 2014 budget as supporting ordinary people. Opponents criticised Shapps of being patronising to working people by believing their pastimes were limited to bingo and beer, and it drew critical national headlines. \n\nShapps ceased being co-chairman of the Conservative Party in May 2015.\n\nOn 11 May 2015, Shapps was sacked from the cabinet, which he had attended as Conservative party co-chairman and minister without portfolio at the Cabinet Office, and appointed as minister of state at the Department for International Development. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said the change appeared to be a demotion, while \"The Guardian\"s chief political correspondent, Nicholas Watt, went further, calling it \"a humiliating blow\".\n\nOn 28 November 2015, Shapps stood down as minister of state due to allegations of bullying within the Conservative Party. It has been claimed that Shapps, in his previous role as party co-chairman, had ignored repeated allegations of bullying involving Mark Clarke, the then party youth organiser. Baroness Warsi, Shapps's predecessor as co-chair of the Conservative Party, had written to Shapps to raise concerns about Clarke's conduct in January 2015. Shapps had appointed Clarke to head his party's \"RoadTrip 2015\" campaign in January 2015. Clarke denies all allegations. The alleged bullying may have caused a young party member, Elliott Johnson, to commit suicide. The day before Shapps's resignation, Johnson's father had called on Shapps to step down and made the following comments:\n\nBoris Johnson appointed Shapps Secretary of State for Transport upon his accession to Prime Minister.\n\nOn 23 September 2019, Thomas Cook Group fell into administration, leaving more than 150,000 British tourists in need of repatriation. When asked why the government chose not to bail out the company, Shapps said \"I fear it would have kept them afloat for a very short period of time and then we would have been back in the position of needing to repatriate people in any case.\" Similarities were noted about Shapps's subsequent speech in the House of Commons on the matter and the one made by previous Transport Secretary Chris Grayling on the collapse of Monarch Airlines. \n\nIn the February 2020 cabinet reshuffle he retained this portfolio.\n\nIn May 2008, Shapps was cited as one of several shadow ministers who had received cash from firms linked to their portfolios. The donors were originally recruited by Michael Gove who previously held the shadow housing portfolio. The Conservative party said shadow ministers had not been influenced by donations. \"Some Conservative policy on housing is actually against the policy of the donors\", said a Conservative spokesman. Shadow ministers are allowed to receive donations from organisations covered by their brief as long as the person has a company in the UK or lives in the UK. The Commissioner exonerated all shadow cabinet members involved.\n\nShapps's use of the names Michael Green and Sebastian Fox attracted controversy in 2012. He denied having used a pseudonym after entering parliament and, in 2014, threatened legal action against a constituent who had stated on Facebook that he had. In February 2015 he told LBC Radio presenter Shelagh Fogarty, \"Let me get this absolutely clear ... I don't have a second job and have never had a second job while being an MP. End of story.\"\n\nHowever, in March 2015, Shapps admitted to having had a second job whilst being an MP, and practising business under a pseudonym. In his admission, he stated that he had \"over-firmly denied\" having a second job. Under the name Michael Green, Shapps had offered customers a \"get-rich-quick scheme\" costing $497, and promised customers a \"toolkit\" that would earn them $20,000 in 20 days, provided they followed its instructions. In March 2015, Dean Archer, the constituent previously threatened with legal action by Shapps, threatened Shapps with legal action.\n\nIn 2012 the \"Guardian\" reported that Shapps's English Wikipedia article had been edited from his office to remove embarrassing information and correct an error. Shapps stated that he had not touched his Wikipedia biography for years and that he only edited to make it more accurate. During the 2015 general election campaign, \"The Guardian\" reported allegations by a Wikipedia administrator that Shapps had used a sockpuppet account, Contribsx, to remove embarrassing material from his own English Wikipedia page and make \"largely unflattering\" edits to articles about other politicians, including some in his own party. \n\nShapps denied the allegations; the \"Telegraph\" claimed his accuser was a \"Liberal Democrat activist\". English Wikipedia's Arbitration Committee found there was \"no significant evidence\" to link the Contribsx account to Shapps. The elected committee censured the administrator responsible for the allegation; for causing the investigation; for making false allegations to \"The Guardian\"; and for blocking the Contribsx account. Another administrator removed the block placed on the account.\n\nIn October 2017, Shapps called for Theresa May's resignation, saying that the party could not \"bury its head in the sand\" in the wake of the June election. The day before, it was suggested that anti-May factions in the Tory party did not have the numbers of votes needed to call for a party leadership election. Shapps said that 30 MPs and \"one or two\" cabinet ministers agreed with him that Theresa May should resign. May resigned 2 years later.\n\nIn August 2018, the \"Financial Times\" reported that it had discovered a \"secret pay deal\" between Shapps and OpenBrix, a British blockchain property portal company. The story was extensively covered in the UK and online press, and alleged that Shapps would have received a payment in cryptocurrency tokens with a future value of up to £700,000. Shapps resigned from OpenBrix and from his position as chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on blockchain which he had founded. Subsequently, Jo Platt, an opposition politician, called for an enquiry into Shapps's conduct, although Shapps maintained that he had confirmed with the standards commissioner that he was not required to register the interest, and that he had recorded the conversation with the relevant official.\n\n"}
{"id": "1872059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872059", "title": "Fasciculation", "text": "Fasciculation\n\nA fasciculation, or muscle twitch, is a small, local, involuntary muscle contraction and relaxation which may be visible under the skin. Deeper areas can be detected by electromyography (EMG) testing, though they can happen in any skeletal muscle in the body. Fasciculations arise as a result of spontaneous depolarization of a lower motor neuron leading to the synchronous contraction of all the skeletal muscle fibers within a single motor unit. An example of normal spontaneous depolarization is the constant contractions of cardiac muscle, causing the heart to beat. Usually, intentional movement of the involved muscle causes fasciculations to cease immediately, but they may return once the muscle is at rest again.\n\nFasciculations have a variety of causes, the majority of which are benign, but can also be due to disease of the motor neurons. They are encountered by virtually all healthy people, though for most, it is quite infrequent. In some cases, the presence of fasciculations can be annoying and interfere with quality of life. If a neurological examination is otherwise normal and EMG testing does not indicate any additional pathology, a diagnosis of benign fasciculation syndrome is usually made.\n\n\nThe most effective way to detect fasciculations may be surface electromyography (EMG). Surface EMG is more sensitive than needle electromyography and clinical observation in the detection of fasciculation in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n\nRisk factors for benign fasciculations may include the use of anticholinergic drugs over long periods. In particular, these include ethanolamines such as diphenhydramine (brand names Benadryl, Dimedrol, Daedalon and Nytol), used as an antihistamine and sedative, and dimenhydrinate (brand names Dramamine, Driminate, Gravol, Gravamin, Vomex, and Vertirosan) for nausea and motion sickness. Persons with benign fasciculation syndrome (BFS) may experience paraesthesia (especially numbness) shortly after taking such medication; fasciculation episodes begin as the medication wears off.\n\nStimulants can cause fasciculations directly. These include caffeine, pseudoephedrine (Sudafed), amphetamines, and the asthma bronchodilators salbutamol (brand names Proventil, Combivent, Ventolin). Medications used to treat attention deficit disorder (ADHD) often contain stimulants as well, and are common causes of benign fasciculations. Since asthma and ADHD are much more serious than the fasciculations themselves, this side effect may have to be tolerated by the patient after consulting a physician or pharmacist.\n\nThe depolarizing neuromuscular blocker succinylcholine causes fasciculations. It is a normal side effect of the drug's administration, and can be prevented with a small dose of a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocker prior to the administration of succinylcholine, often 10% of a nondepolarizing NMB's induction dose.\n\nEven if a drug such as caffeine causes fasciculations, that does not necessarily mean it is the only cause. For example, a very slight magnesium deficiency by itself (see below) might not be enough for fasciculations to occur, but when combined with caffeine, the two factors together could be enough.\n\nInadequate magnesium intake can cause fasciculations, especially after a magnesium loss due to severe diarrhea. Over-exertion and heavy alcohol consumption are also risk factors for magnesium loss. As 70–80% of the adult population does not consume the recommended daily amount of magnesium, inadequate intake may also be a common cause. Treatment consists of increased intake of magnesium from dietary sources such as nuts (especially almonds), bananas, and spinach. Magnesium supplements or pharmaceutical magnesium preparations may also be taken. However, too much magnesium may cause diarrhea, resulting in dehydration and nutrient loss (including magnesium itself, leading to a net loss, rather than a gain). It is well known as a laxative (Milk of Magnesia), though chelated magnesium can largely reduce this effect. \n\nFasciculation also often occurs during a rest period after sustained stress, such as that brought on by unconsciously tense muscles. Reducing stress and anxiety is therefore another useful treatment.\n\nThere is no proven treatment for fasciculations in people with ALS. Among patients with ALS, fasciculation frequency is not associated with the duration of ALS and is independent of the degree of limb weakness and limb atrophy. No prediction of ALS disease duration can be made based on fasciculation frequency alone.\n\n"}

It is situated on the River Parrett, 5 miles (8 km) west of Yeovil, and has a population of 275.\n\nThe village consists largely of small cottages built in the local golden hamstone quarried at the local Ham Hill.\n\nThe village was recorded in Saxon times as ‘Ceoselbergon’ and was later mentioned in the Domesday Book as ‘Ceolseberge’ in the holding of Robert, Count of Mortain. The name derives from the Old English \"cisel\" and \"beorg\" (gravel and hill).\n\nThe parish was part of the hundred of Houndsborough.\n\nThe Earls of Ilchester held most of the village until 1914 when the estate was sold, having inherited it from the heirs of Joan Wadham, Lady Strangways, first wife of Sir Giles Strangways (1528-1562) of Melbury Sampford, sister and co-heiress of Nicholas Wadham, co-founder of Wadham College, Oxford. The current Baron and Baroness of Chiselborough do not reside in the area.\n\nThe annual Chiselborough Fair was held on common ground near the street now known as Fair Place.\n\nThe parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning.

The mall has also been a shooting location for many films, most notably the seminal 1982 film \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" as well as the 1983 film \"Valley Girl\", both of which focused on the early 1980s San Fernando Valley youth culture.\n\nThe three-level mall was built on the site of Moses Sherman's original 1911 thousand-acre investment in the area, at the present-day intersection of Ventura and Sepulveda boulevards. It opened in 1980 with two department stores (Robinsons anchored the south, May Company anchored the north). Pacific Theatres' \"Pacific 4\" occupied the uppermost level of the mall. The mall became famous in the early 1980s as being the center of the teenage mall culture and a well-known teenage hangout. \nThe Galleria formed the basis of the Frank Zappa/Moon Unit Zappa 1982 satirical single \"Valley Girl\" from Zappa's album \"Ship Arriving Too Late To Save A Drowning Witch\".\nFollowing on the popularity of the song, the TV show \"Real People\" hosted an Ultimate Valley Girl competition (referred to as \"a nightmare\" by contest judge Moon Zappa), at the Galleria. In 1993, Robinsons and May Company merged, forming Robinsons-May - both stores in the mall were converted to Robinsons-May, the north store becoming a Men's and Home store, and the south store becoming a Women's and Children's store.\n\nThe next decade saw business at the Galleria decline. In January 1994, the mall closed for 11 days for repairs following the Northridge earthquake. Although the mall reopened quickly, Robinson-May didn't re-open its south wing store for four years following the earthquake, and many smaller stores on that floor closed. During that closure, the mall suffered due to having only one main anchor store. Mall management sued to evict Robinson-May in 1998, alleging that the delay was a lease violation and caused the store closures, but R-M countersued, claiming that poor mall promotion and management were the cause. Closures continued through the 1990s until a gift and jewelry shop was one of the few remaining stores in 1999.\n\nThe mall closed in April 1999 for a major renovation and reopened in 2002 as an open-air center which was quite different from its previous incarnation. The new layout was termed \"mixed-use\". The only remnant of the original mall is the court where the Pacific 16 Theatres is located, which are on the uppermost of what was previously the southern Robinsons-May store. The majority of the remaining mall was turned into offices. Warner Bros. set up offices in what was once one of the mall entrances. Several mortgage companies and financial services providers are headquartered within the center. Additional tenants include 24 Hour Fitness, Burke Williams Day Spa, Devry, the Paul Mitchell School, as well as several major restaurant chains (Cheesecake Factory, P. F. Chang's China Bistro, Buffalo Wild Wings, & Frida's Mexican). The remodeling and new construction were designed by Gensler and built by Peck/Jones Construction, which in 2005 filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\n\nOn Monday, June 4, 2007, the Pacific Galleria 16 Theaters changed into an ArcLight Cinema, as the Pacific Theaters own the ArcLight brand. The transformation began gradually, with re-branding at the start, and renovation throughout the summer of 2007. The theater was closed for three months to complete the process.\n\nThe Galleria was featured in scenes in several films. \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\", \"Valley Girl\"(aerial, exterior shots), \"Night of the Comet\",\n\"Commando\", \"Back to the Future Part II\", Albert Brooks' \"Mother\",\n\"\", \"Walk Like a Man\" (1987), \"Innerspace\" and \"Chopping Mall\" were filmed at the Galleria, as were scenes for the 2011 release \"Crazy, Stupid, Love\".\n\n"}

The river Rot runs through it. Achstetten lies approximately north of the city of Laupheim and approximately south of the city of Ulm.\n\nThe name \"Achstetten\" is derived from the Old High German words \"aha\" meaning water, and \"stet\", meaning place; the name meaning thus \"place close to water\".\n\nClose to the road to Ersingen, tumuli from the Hallstatt period have been discovered. This indicates that the area has been settled for at least 2500 years. Celtic tribes are associated with Hallstatt culture.\n\nDuring the Roman period, Achstetten was also a place of settlement, indicated by the remains of Roman villa. The outlines of this structure are visible on aerial photographs.\n\nThe Hil(de)gartstraße in Achstetten is a reminder of an early mediaeval trade route. It is a relic of a route leading from Konstanz via Meersburg towards Ulm and then further via Heidenheim to Aalen and Würzburg, terminating at Fulda. There is evidence to indicate that a road towards the crossing of the river Iller branched off on the territory of Achstetten. This road would then lead on towards Regensburg.\n\nAchstetten is first mentioned in a charter dated 1194. This charter was signed by Pope Celestine III, confirming the rights of Wiblingen Abbey in \"Asteten\". The possessions of the monastery of Wiblingen in Achstetten were, however, certainly older than 1194.\n\nFrom 1356 to 1447, the Freiherrn von Freyberg were the sole rulers of Achstetten. In 1442, the rule over Achstetten was divided amongst three brothers, Eberhard von Freyberg, Hans von Freyberg and Wilhelm von Freyberg. However, in 1447, Wilhelm von Freyberg sold his part to Gutenzell Abbey. As a consequence, the Freiherrn von Freyberg were forced to share the rule of the village with Gutenzell Abbey until 1625.\n\nIn 1594, Ochsenhausen Abbey bought the second half of the revenues made from tithes, having already owned the first half for some time.\n\nThrough marriage, the two remaining parts of Achstetten came into the possession of the Counts of Öttingen-Spielberg in 1689. They exchanged it in 1765, so that from 1765 onwards, it was part of the landed territories of the Freiherrn von Welden. The Freiherrn von Welden sold it on 12 May 1795 to the last Komtur of the Teutonic Knights, the Freiherr Beat Conrad Reuttner von Weyl. He transferred his possession to his nephew Julius Cäsar Reuttner von Weyl, who, in 1802, bought the rights of the revenue from the complete tithes from Ochsenhausen Abbey. He was elevated to the rank of count in 1819. To this day, his successors are owners of the Lordship of Achstetten.\n\nFollowing the secularization in 1803, the Counts of Toerring-Gutenzell became the inheritors of the share of Gutenzell Abbey, part of which had, since 1449, also been the hamlet of Mönchhöfe.\n\nAs part of the mediatization, Achstetten became temporarily part of Bavaria in 1805, only to be handed over to the newly formed Kingdom of Württemberg in 1806.\nAfter having initially been part of the district of Wiblingen, it became part of the district of Laupheim in 1845. On 1 October 1938, Achstetten became part of the district of\nBiberach.\n\nOn 1 March 1972, the formerly independent municipality of Oberholzheim was incorporated into Achstetten, followed on 1 November 1972 by Bronnen and on 1 January 1975 by Stetten.\n\nThe three silver balls on blue were taken from the coat of arms of the Freiherrn of Freyberg who ruled the village from 1356 to 1625. The red and silver banderole is a reminder of the Cistercian abbey in Gutenzell with whom the Freiherrn of Freyberg shared authority over the village from 1447 onwards.\n\nOriginally, Achstetten was part of the parish of Laupheim. It became an independent parish in 1442, when the Freiherrn von Freyberg founded a new parish, subordinate to the monastery of Ochsenhausen.\n\nThe monastery of Ochsenhausen had the church St Oswald and Agatha built in Renaissance-style in 1625, replacing a late mediaeval structure at the same location.\n\nIn 1823, the spire was raised and a new top was added. The interior was last renovated in 1932 and a new pipe organ was installed in 2000.\n\nThe gallery is separated into two parts, one part designated for the general public, and a second part into which only the former rulers of Achstetten, members of the dynasty of Reuttner von Weyl, were permitted. The compartment for the aristocracy is connected to the castle by a passageway, built on wooden columns. A similar structure existed in Laupheim. There, however, the passageway is only preserved in fragments.\n\nThe Chapel of the Annunciation was built ca. 1650, immediately after the Thirty Years' War, as a burial church for the Freiherrn von Freyberg. Following the acquisition of Achstetten by the Counts of Reuttner von Weyl in 1795, the chapel has been used as the final resting place for members of that family. The structure of the Chapel is marked by flat wall-pillars on the interior as well as the exterior, a semi-circular choir and a pointed-topped spire.\n\nA castle was first mentioned in 1386. The original castle was burnt down in 1525 during the German Peasants' War after the Baltringer Haufen had stormed the building. A rebuilding of the castle at the same location was mentioned in 1583. The last Komtur of the Teutonic Knights, Freiherr Beat Conrad Reuttner von Weyl, had a new castle built by the official architect of the Teutonic Knights, Franz Anton Bagnato, between 1794 and 1796.\n\nAs early as 1449, a tavern was mentioned to have existed in Achstetten. In 1573, the two lordships over Achstetten determined that apart from this one, no other tavern or inn was to be allowed in Achstetten. Even then, the inn was used as a place for gatherings where the villagers would discuss and decide local affairs. The present building was erected at the beginning of the 18th century and continued to serve as a country inn until 2008 when it was converted into individual flats. In 2010, the designation of the building was changed when the local council approved plans by developers to establish a hostel for travelling tradesmen on the premises.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1872089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872089", "title": "Warsaw Concerto", "text": "Warsaw Concerto\n\nThe Warsaw Concerto is a short work for piano and orchestra by Richard Addinsell, written for the 1941 British film \"Dangerous Moonlight\", which is about the Polish struggle against the 1939 invasion by Nazi Germany. In performance it normally lasts just under ten minutes. The concerto is an example of programme music, representing both the struggle for Warsaw and the romance of the leading characters in the film. It became very popular in Britain during World War II.\n\nThe concerto is written in imitation of the style of Sergei Rachmaninoff. It initiated a trend for similar short piano concertos in the Romantic style, which have been dubbed \"tabloid concertos\".\n\nThe composer, Richard Addinsell, was born in London and initially studied law before turning to a career in music. His time at the Royal College of Music was brief, as he was soon drawn to musical theatre, and he also wrote for radio, but his most memorable contributions are to a series of film scores beginning in 1936. He wrote the music for the 1939 film \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\", the original \"Gaslight\" (released in 1940, not to be confused with the later Hollywood version), \"Scrooge\", and \"Dangerous Moonlight\" (1941, also released in the US as \"Suicide Squadron\"). It is this last picture that began the trend of “tabloid concertos,” classical-style compositions written for performance in movies. John Huntley explores the reason behind this concept: \nThe associations which individual members of the audience may have in relation to a certain piece of well-known music are quite beyond the control of the director of a film in which it is used…. And so with \"Dangerous Moonlight\" it was rightly decided to have a piece of music specially written, that could be used to become associated in the mind of the audience with Poland, air raids in Warsaw, and whatever the director wanted to suggest.\n\nThe concerto was not part of the original plan. According to Roy Douglas, at that time orchestrator for all of Addinsell's scores: \"The film's director had originally wanted to use Sergei Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto, but this idea was either forbidden by the copyright owners or was far too expensive\". Thus Addinsell wanted the piece to sound as much like Rachmaninoff as possible, and Douglas remembers, \"while I was orchestrating the \"Warsaw Concerto\" I had around me the miniature scores of the Second and Third Piano Concertos, as well as the \"Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini\".\" And although it is at the heart of \"Dangerous Moonlight\", the Concerto is never performed complete but rather revealed piecemeal. The opening of the work is heard when the two protagonists meet, and it is further developed when they are on their honeymoon. Finally, in the only extended concert sequence, we are given the closing section. But its use is not restricted to scenes with the \"composer\" at the piano. The themes are found as underscoring throughout the film, and in this way a brief concert piece gains a dramatic resonance that belies its small scale.\n\n\"Dangerous Moonlight\" takes place at the start of World War II and tells the story of a Polish concert pianist and composer, Stefan Radecki (Anton Walbrook) who defends his country by becoming a fighter pilot. After an air raid in Warsaw by the German army, he is discovered by an American reporter, Carol Peters (Sally Gray), practising the piano in a bombed-out building. It is the opening of his \"Warsaw Concerto\", at this point a work in progress, and the first line he says to her is, \"It is not safe to be out alone when the moon is so bright\" (referring to the moonlight bombing raids). Gazing intently at Carol and disclosing \"something lovely you've just given me\", he introduces the lyrical second theme of the Concerto. And, indeed, this melody is always associated with Carol. Like Rachmaninoff, Addinsell introduces it almost as a nocturne. Stefan speaks of the piece later in the film: \"This music is you and me. It's the story of the two of us in Warsaw, of us in America, of us in … where else I don't know. That's why I can't finish it\". But finish it he does. Similar to the way that Rachmaninoff returns to his second theme in his Second Piano Concerto, the \"Carol\" melody is used, not only to bind together the emotional strands of the drama, but to bring the Concerto to a triumphant conclusion. Throughout the film, the unfinished piece is defined in a relationship with Frédéric Chopin's \"Military\" Polonaise, symbolising Polish patriotism. It is \"completed\" when the Polonaise elements are integrated with the Romantic theme, implying the fusion of romantic and patriotic love.\n\nWithin the context of its story, \"Dangerous Moonlight\" is also effective in creating the impression of a larger work written and performed by the film's fictional composer and pianist. When snatches of the Concerto are first played, one character tells another, \"I've got the records\", and when the \"premiere\" is shown, we are provided with a close-up of the program, \"Warsaw Concerto\", with three movements listed. Only one movement was actually written by Addinsell.\n\nThe success of the film led to an immediate demand for the work, and a recording was dutifully supplied from the film’s soundtrack (at nine minutes, it fit perfectly on two sides of a 12-inch disk playing at 78 rpm) along with sheet music for a piano solo version. Such unexpected success had another consequence. The off-screen piano part was played by Louis Kentner, a fine British musician known for his performances of Franz Liszt, but he had insisted that there be no on-screen credit, for fear that his participation in a popular entertainment would harm his classical reputation. He lost his qualms when the recording sold in the millions, and Douglas notes that he even asked for royalties (they were granted). Ultimately the \"Warsaw Concerto\" was such a hit that it made the then unusual journey from movie screen to concert hall.\n\nIn his 1944 appearance on \"Desert Island Discs\", Guy Gibson, leader of the Dambusters raid, asked for it as his first choice.\n\nOne commentator has suggested that the \"Warsaw Concerto\" is the most significant instrumental work written in Britain during the war, still conjuring up a time and place better than any other piece.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1872110", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872110", "title": "Hordle", "text": "Hordle\n\nHordle is a village and civil parish in the county of Hampshire, England. It is situated between the Solent coast and the New Forest, and is bordered by the towns of Lymington and New Milton. Like many New Forest parishes Hordle has no village centre. The civil parish includes the hamlets of Tiptoe and Everton as well as part of Downton.\nThe parish was originally much larger; stretching from the New Forest boundary to Hurst Castle.\n\nHordle has a several shops including a post office, a pharmacy, and Co-operative Stores. The village also has a primary school, and a pub: \"The Three Bells\".\n\nThe present civil parish is somewhat smaller than the it used to contain, but still includes the hamlets of Tiptoe and Everton. Originally the parish included both Hurst Spit (and Hurst Castle) as well as Sway tower. During the 19th century, Hurst Spit and adjacent areas were transferred to Milford whilst the hamlet of Everton was included in Hordle. Similarly, a northwestern section was transferred to the newly created parish of Sway.\n\nThe soils of the parish are based mainly on well drained gravels to the south and clayey loams to the north: the character of the parish is agricultural, although in medieval times a few saltworks were operated on the coast.\n\nThe present parish church, All Saints, was built in 1872 and succeeded a previous building on the same site dating from 1830 which fell down. Prior to this, the parish church was for some 700 years located a mile further south, where the churchyard still remains at Hordle Cliff. The local tradition telling of the existence of the original village near the church, which has disappeared into the sea owing to cliff erosion, is a myth although there is no doubting the substantial (and ongoing) coastal ersosion.\n\nThe name Hordle is generally believed to mean hoard hill – OE hordhyll – (treasure hill), There is no connection with \"Golden Hill\" which lies on the main road from Hordle to Ashley and which is a Victorian invention as is Silver Street. In modern times, one 4th-century copper coin (of Maximus) has been found in a garden near Golden Hill.\n\nHordle is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 when it comprised the manors of Hordle and Arnwood. Hordle manor then belonged to Oidelard, who held it of Ralph de Mortimer. Afterwards held by the de Redvers family, Earls of Devon, it was granted to Pagan Trenchard around 1140.\nTwo separate manors evolved, one the Trenchard Manor and the other that held by Breamore Priory.\n\nThe priory manor was afterwards known as the manor of Hordle Breamore. The priory continued to hold the estate up to the Dissolution. In 1537 the estate was granted to Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter and his wife Gertrude. In 1578, however, it belonged to Thomas Carew, who dying that year was succeeded by his son Henry. It passed to his son Henry in 1614, and then to his son George in 1639. It passed through various hands until it was purchased in 1863 by Colonel Frederick Clinton whose family sold the estate in the 1950s.\n\nThe manor of Hordle Trenchard was held by Henry Trenchard in the 13th century together with Sharprix (modern Walhampton). His successor John Trenchard was in 1309 described as chief lord of Hordle, and in 1346 the estate belonged to another Henry Trenchard. In 1428 John Trenchard was lord of Hordle, but later in the same year, no doubt after his death, Robert Dingley and John Lisle owned the half fee which had once belonged to him. In 1633 it was again in the hands of a distantly related branch of the Trenchards, Sir Thomas Trenchard, suffering a recovery of the manor of Hordle, which had belonged to his father, Sir George. In 1747 the manor was sold to William Rickman and a few years later it was acquired by Edward Ives, who in 1773 conveyed it to John Missing. It probably merged with the main manor in the 19th century.\n\nThe Domesday Book mentions a watermill at Hordle, although this has long since disappeared. An 18th-century watermill is visible nearby at Gordleton, just to the east of the present village. Another 18th-century mill at Efford lies on the border of the parish with Pennington.\n\nWith the enclosure of Arnewood Common in the early nineteenth century, the main centre of population moved northwards, away from the coast, and to meet this change the ancient parish church was demolished in 1830 and moved to its present situation close to the now enclosed Downton Common, two miles (3 km) to the north. There was no school in the parish until 1860. In the 1870s, Hordle Grange on Vaggs Lane was, for 3 years, home to the religious sect known locally as the New Forest Shakers. They were eventually evicted from this home and they moved to nearby Tiptoe, where they lived in tents until their leader, Mary Ann Girling, died in 1886.\n\nAfter about 1920 considerable infilling took place in the parish and this accelerated in the 1950s and 60s leading to a much increased population that largely seeks its livelihood in the neighbouring towns of Lymington and New Milton. The parish population in 1801 was 446 and by 1931 this had increased by a thousand and it has gone on growing ever since. Hordle today, despite considerable growth, still manages to retain its rural character helped by the green belts that separate it from the adjoining parishes. The population of the parish in the 2001 census was 5,271 people.\n\nBuildings of national importance are no longer within the parish boundary. These are Hurst Castle, one of Henry VIII's defensive works, and Sway tower (also known as Arnewood or Peterson's tower) the tallest non-reinforced concrete construction in the world.\n\nA church is recorded in the cartulary of Christchurch Priory early in the twelfth century. From very early times Hordle was a parochial chapelry of the vicarage of Milford and served by the vicar, until February 1867 when Hordle was declared a vicarage distinct from that of Milford. The old church was pulled down in 1830 being derelict. The site of the old church is at Hordle Cliff, about 2 miles to the south of the present village, and consists only of a graveyard inclosure. Several illustrations of the old church are preserved at the vicarage and show it to have consisted of chancel, north and south transepts with chapels, nave and central bell turret. The south door at least was of 12th-century date. \nThe present parish church, All Saints, was built in 1872 and succeeded a previous building on the same site dating from 1830.\n\nThe Domesday Book mentions six saltpans here but the industry declined thereafter and ceased well before the end of the 14th century apart from a saltworks on Hurst Spit.\n\n"}

In compound words, may be a consonant sequence rather than a digraph, as in the of \"lighthouse\".\n\nIn standard English, the phonetic realization of the dental fricative phonemes shows less variation than for many other English consonants. Both are pronounced either interdentally, with the blade of the tongue resting against the lower part of the back of the upper teeth and the tip protruding slightly, or with the tip of the tongue against the back of the upper teeth. These two positions may be in free variation, but for some speakers they are in complementary distribution, the position behind the teeth being used when the dental fricative stands in proximity to an alveolar fricative or , as in \"myths\" () or \"clothes\" (). Lip configuration may vary depending on phonetic context. The vocal folds are abducted. The velopharyngeal port is closed. Air forced between tongue surface and cutting edge of the upper teeth (interdental) or inside surface of the teeth (dental) creates audible frictional turbulence.\n\nThe difference between and is normally described as a voiceless–voiced contrast, as this is the aspect native speakers are most aware of. However, the two phonemes are also distinguished by other phonetic markers. There is a difference of energy (see: Fortis and lenis), the fortis being pronounced with more muscular tension than the lenis . Also, is more strongly aspirated than , as can be demonstrated by holding a hand a few centimeters in front of the mouth and noticing the differing force of the puff of air created by the articulatory process. and can be referred to as \"hard \" and \"soft \", respectively, in a similar manner to <c> and <g> \n\nAs with many English consonants, a process of assimilation can result in the substitution of other speech sounds in certain phonetic environments. Native speakers do this subconsciously.\n\nAt word boundaries, alveolar stops next to dental fricatives assimilate very regularly, especially in rapid colloquial speech, involving both the place of articulation and the manner of articulation: the \"alveolar\" stops become \"dental\", while the dental \"fricatives\" become \"stops\". The resulting consonant is usually long (geminated) which may be the only cue for the speaker to distinguish particular words (for example, the definite and indefinite articles, compare \"run the mile\" and \"run a mile\" ).\n\nThe alveolar fricatives may become dental as well:\n\nIn rapid speech, \"sixth(s)\" may be pronounced like \"six\". \"Them\" may be contracted to \" 'em\", and in this case the contraction is often indicated in writing. Some linguists see \" 'em\" as originally a separate word, a remnant of Old English \"hem\", but as the apostrophe shows, it is perceived in modern English as a contraction of \"them\".\n\nIn some dialects, both as spoken by native speakers and by L2 speakers of English, the \"th\"-sound phonemes and are pronounced differently than the dental fricatives and . Most common are: substitution with labiodental fricatives and (fronting), substitution with alveolar stops and (stopping), and substitution with alveolar fricatives and (alveolarization). Fronting and stopping are more common among native speakers of English dialects, whereas alveolarization is more common among language learners whose first languages are French, German or Mandarin. To speakers of varieties in which and are pronounced and , fronting and stopping are generally considered to have less of a marked contrast with the standard pronunciation than alveolarization, which is often more stigmatized.\n\nA fourth, less common substitution is for word-initially or intervocalically. This is called debuccalization, and somewhat prevalent in Scottish English.\n\nIn some areas, such as London and northern New Zealand, and in some dialects, including African American Vernacular English, many people realise the phonemes and as and , respectively. Although traditionally stigmatised as typical of a Cockney accent, this pronunciation is fairly widespread, especially when immediately surrounded by other fricatives for ease of pronunciation, and has, in the early 20th century, become an increasingly noticeable feature of the Estuary English accent of South East England. It has in at least one case been transferred into standard English as a neologism: a \"bovver boy\" is a thug, a \"boy\" who likes \"bother\" (fights). Joe Brown and his Bruvvers was a Pop group of the 1960s. The song \"Fings ain't wot they used t'be\" was the title song of a 1959 Cockney comedy. Similarly, a New Zealander from the northernmost parts of the country might state that he or she is from \"Norfland\".\n\nNote that, at least in Cockney, a word beginning with (as opposed to its voiceless counterpart ) can never be labiodental. Instead, it is realised as any of , or is dropped altogether.\n\nMany speakers of African American Vernacular English, Caribbean English, Liberian English, Nigerian English, Philadelphia English, and Philippine English (along with other Asian English varieties) pronounce the fricatives as alveolar stops . Similarly, but still distinctly, many speakers of New York City English, Chicago English, Boston English, Indian English, Newfoundland English, and Hiberno-English use the dental stops (typically distinct from alveolar ) instead of, or in free variation with, .\n\nIn Cockney, the th-stopping may occur when a word begins with (but not its voiceless counterpart ). This is also associated with the accent of the English city of Sheffield (such as the nickname \"dee-dahs\" for residents) but such pronunciations are now confined to the very oldest residents of Sheffield.\n\nTh-alveolarization is a process that occurs in some African varieties of English where the dental fricatives merge with the alveolar fricatives and . It is an example of assibilation.\n\nIn rarer or older varieties of African American Vernacular English, may be pronounced after a vowel and before another consonant, as in \"bathroom\" .\n\nTh-alveolarization is often parodied as typical of French- and German-speaking learners of English, but it is widespread among many other foreign learners because the dental fricative \"th\" sounds are not very common among the world's languages. Due to the said ridicule, learners who are unable to realize these sounds sometimes opt for the less marked th-fronting or th-stopping instead of alveolarization.\n\nIn many varieties of Scottish English, becomes word initially and intervocalically. It is a stage in the process of lenition, and is how \"th\" is normally pronounced syllable-initially in Gaelic.\n\nTh-debuccalization occurs mainly in Glasgow and across the Central Belt. A common example is for \"think\". This feature is becoming more common in these places over time, but is still variable. In word final position, is used, as in standard English.\n\nThe existence of local for in Glasgow complicates the process of th-fronting there, a process which gives for historical . Unlike in the other dialects with th-fronting, where solely varies with , in Glasgow, the introduction of th-fronting there creates a three-way variant system of , and .\n\nUse of marks the local educated norms (the regional standard), while use of and instead mark the local non-standard norms. is well known in Glasgow as a vernacular variant of when it occurs at the start of a word and intervocalically, while has only recently risen above the level of social consciousness.\n\nGiven that th-fronting is a relatively recent innovation in Glasgow, it was expected that linguists might find evidence for lexical diffusion for and the results found from Glaswegian speakers confirm this. The existing and particular lexical distribution of th-debuccalization imposes special constraints on the progress of th-fronting in Glasgow.\n\nIn accents with th-debuccalization, the cluster becomes , giving these dialects a consonant cluster that doesn't occur in other dialects. The replacement of with leads to pronunciations like:\n\n\nChildren generally learn the less marked phonemes of their native language before the more marked ones. In the case of English-speaking children, and are often among the last phonemes to be learnt, frequently not being mastered before the age of five. Prior to this age, many children substitute the sounds and respectively. For small children, \"fought\" and \"thought\" are therefore homophones. As British and American children begin school at age four and five respectively, this means that many are learning to read and write before they have sorted out these sounds, and the infantile pronunciation is frequently reflected in their spelling errors: \"ve fing\" for \"the thing\".\n\nChildren with a lisp, however, have trouble distinguishing and from and respectively in speech, using a single or pronunciation for both, and may never master the correct sounds without speech therapy. The lisp is a common speech impediment in English.\n\nForeign learners may have parallel problems. Learners from very many cultural backgrounds have difficulties with English dental fricatives, usually caused by interference with either sibilants or stops. Words with a dental fricative adjacent to an alveolar fricative, such as \"clothes\" , \"truths\" , \"fifths\" , \"sixths\" , \"anesthetic\" , etc., are commonly very difficult for foreign learners to pronounce. Some of these words containing consonant clusters can also be difficult for native speakers, including those using the standard and pronunciations generally, allowing such accepted informal pronunciations of \"clothes\" as (a homonym of the verb \"close\") and \"fifth(s)\" as .\n\nIn modern English, and bear a phonemic relationship to each other, as is demonstrated by the presence of a small number of minimal pairs: \"thigh:thy, ether:either, teeth:teethe, sooth:soothe, mouth(n):mouth(v)\". Thus they are distinct phonemes (units of sound, differences in which can affect meaning), as opposed to allophones (different pronunciations of a phoneme having no effect on meaning). They are distinguished from the neighbouring labiodental fricatives, sibilants and alveolar stops by such minimal pairs as \"thought:fought/sought/taught\" and \"then:Venn/Zen/den\".\n\nThe vast majority of words in English with have , and almost all newly created words do. However, the constant recurrence of the function words, particularly \"the\", means that is nevertheless more frequent in actual use.\n\nThe distribution pattern may be summed up in the following rule of thumb, which is valid in most cases: in an initial position, is used except in certain function words; in a medial position, is used except for certain foreign loan words; and in final position, is used except in certain verbs. A more detailed explanation follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn pairs of related words, an alternation between and is possible, which may be thought of as a kind of consonant mutation. Typically appears in the singular of a noun, in the plural and in the related verb: \"cloth\" , \"clothes\" , \"to clothe\" . This is directly comparable to the or alternation in \"house, houses\" or \"wolf, wolves\". It goes back to the allophonic variation in Old English (see below), where it was possible for to be in final position and thus voiceless in the basic form of a word, but in medial position and voiced in a related form. The loss of inflections then brought the voiced medial consonant to the end of the word. Often a remnant of the old inflection can be seen in the spelling in the form of a silent , which may be thought of synchronically as a marker of the voicing.\n\nThe above discussion follows Daniel Jones' English Pronouncing Dictionary, an authority on standard British English, and Webster's New World College Dictionary, an authority on American English. Usage appears much the same between the two. Regional variation within standard English includes the following:\n\nProto-Indo-European (PIE) had no dental fricatives, but these evolved in the earliest stages of the Germanic languages. In Proto-Germanic, and were separate phonemes, usually represented in Germanic studies by the symbols *đ and *þ.\nIn West Germanic, the Proto-Germanic *đ shifted further to *d, leaving only one dental fricative phoneme. However, a new appeared as an allophone of in medial positions by assimilation of the voicing of the surrounding vowels. remained in initial and presumably in final positions (though this is uncertain as later terminal devoicing would in any case have eliminated the evidence of final ). This West Germanic phoneme, complete with its distribution of allophones, survived into Old English. In German and Dutch, it shifted to a , the allophonic distinction simply being lost. In German, West Germanic *d shifted to in what may be thought of as a chain shift, but in Dutch, *þ, *đ and *d merged into a single .\n\nThe whole complex of Germanic dentals, and the place of the fricatives within it, can be summed up in this table:\n\nNote that this table shows only the basic rules. The actual developments in all of the mentioned languages are more complicated (due to dialectal variation, peculiar developments in consonant clusters, etc.). For more on these phonemes from a comparative perspective, see Grammatischer Wechsel. For the developments in German and Dutch see High German consonant shift.\n\nThus English inherited a phoneme in positions where other West Germanic languages have and most other Indo-European languages have : English \"three\", German \"drei\", Latin \"tres\".\n\nIn Old English, the phoneme , like all fricative phonemes in the language, had two allophones, one voiced and one voiceless, which were distributed regularly according to phonetic environment.\n\nAlthough Old English had two graphemes to represent these sounds, (thorn) and (eth), it used them interchangeably, unlike Old Icelandic, which used for and for .\n\nThe most important development on the way to modern English was the investing of the existing distinction between and with phonemic value. Minimal pairs, and hence the phonological independence of the two phones, developed as a result of three main processes.\n\n\nOther changes that affected these phonemes included a shift → when followed by unstressed suffix -er. Thus Old English \"fæder\" became modern English \"father\"; likewise \"mother, gather, hither, together, weather\" (from \"mōdor, gaderian, hider, tōgædere, weder\"). In a reverse process, Old English \"byrþen\" and \"morþor\" or \"myþra\" become \"burden\" and \"murder\" (compare the obsolete variants \"burthen\" and \"murther\").\n\nDialectally, the alternation between and sometimes extends to other words, as \"bladder, ladder, solder\" with (possibly being restricted elsewhere by the former two clashing with \"blather\" and \"lather\"). On the other hand, some dialects retain original \"d,\" and extend it to other words, as \"brother, further, rather\". The Welsh name \"Llewelyn\" appears in older English texts as \"Thlewelyn\" (Rolls of Parliament (\"Rotuli parliamentorum\") I. 463/1, King Edward I or II), and \"Fluellen\" (Shakespeare, \"Henry V\"). \"Th\" also occurs dialectally for \"wh,\" as in \"thirl, thortleberry, thorl,\" for \"whirl, whortleberry, whorl\". Conversely, Scots has \"whaing, whang, white, whittle,\" for \"thwaing, thwang, thwite, thwittle\".\n\nThe old verb inflection \"-eth\" (Old English \"-eþ\") was replaced by \"-s\" (\"he singeth → he sings\"), not a sound shift but a completely new inflection, the origin of which is still being debated. Possibilities include alveolarization (since \"s\" is easier to pronounce there than \"th\"), or displacement by a nonstandard English dialect.\n\nThough English speakers take it for granted, the digraph is in fact not an obvious combination for a dental fricative. The origins of this have to do with developments in Greek.\n\nProto-Indo-European had an aspirated that came into Greek as , spelled with the letter theta. In the Greek of Homer and Plato, this was still pronounced , and therefore when Greek words were borrowed into Latin, theta was transcribed with . Since sounds like with a following puff of air, was the logical spelling in the Latin alphabet.\n\nBy the time of New Testament Greek (koiné), however, the aspirated stop had shifted to a fricative: . Thus theta came to have the sound that it still has in Modern Greek, and which it represents in the IPA. From a Latin perspective, the established digraph now represented the voiceless fricative , and was used thus for English by French-speaking scribes after the Norman Conquest, since they were unfamiliar with the Germanic graphemes ð (eth) and þ (thorn). Likewise, the spelling was used for in Old High German prior to the completion of the High German consonant shift, again by analogy with the way Latin represented the Greek sound. It also appeared in early modern Swedish before a final shift to /d/.\n\nThe history of the digraphs for and for Scots, Welsh or German is parallel.\n\nSince neither nor was a native sound in Latin, the tendency must have emerged early, and at the latest by medieval Latin, to substitute . Thus, in many modern languages, including French and German, the digraph is used in Greek loan-words to represent an original , but is now pronounced : examples are French \"théâtre\", German \"Theater\". In some cases, this etymological , which has no remaining significance for pronunciation, has been transferred to words in which there is no etymological justification for it. For example, German \"Tal\" ('valley', cognate with English \"dale\") appears in many place-names with an archaic spelling \"Thal\" (contrast Neandertal and Neanderthal). The German spelling reform of 1901 largely reversed these, but they remain in some proper nouns. The name \"Rothschild\" is an example of this, being a compound of \"rot[h]\" (\"red\") and \"Schild\" (\"shield\").\n\nExamples of this are also to be found in English, perhaps influenced immediately by French. In some Middle English manuscripts, appears for or : \"tho\" 'to' or 'do', \"thyll\" till, \"whythe\" white, \"thede\" deed. In Modern English we see it in \"Esther\", \"Thomas\", \"Thames\", \"thyme\", \"Witham\" (the town in Essex, not the river in Lincolnshire which is pronounced with ) and the old spelling of Satan as \"Sathan\".\n\nIn a small number of cases, this spelling later influenced the pronunciation: \"amaranth, amianthus\" and \"author\" have spelling pronunciations with , and some English speakers use in \"Neanderthal\".\n\nA few English compound words, such as \"lightheaded\" or \"hothouse\", have the letter combination split between the parts, though this is not a digraph. Here, the and are pronounced separately (\"light-headed\") as a cluster of two consonants. Other examples are \"anthill, goatherd, lighthouse, outhouse, pothead\"; also in words formed with the suffix -\"hood\": \"knighthood\", and the similarly formed Afrikaans loanword \"apartheid\". In a few place names ending in t+ham, the t-h boundary has been lost and become a spelling pronunciation, for example Grantham.\n\n\n"}

It was named after Artemis, the goddess of the Hunt, in some myths the moon,\nand twin sister of Apollo (a reference to the Apollo project). The project's creators, the Lunar Resources Company, formed the Artemis Society as a non-profit NGO in 1994. They planned to cover the costs by exploiting the entertainment value in creating a lunar colony. They also believed that their costs would be a small fraction of what a government agency, such as NASA, would have spent.\n\nThe project studied other space colonization projects as well, including colonies on outer planet moons.\n\nThe \"Reference Mission\" was designed to provide enough infrastructure to create a small lunar base. No flight hardware was built.\n\nThe Lunar transfer Vehicle consisted of a single Spacehab module with communications equipment, Solar panels and an added booster stage. The Lunar Transfer Vehicle would have carried the crew as they travel from the Earth to the Moon. It would have been left in Lunar orbit as the crew descend to the lunar surface.\n\nThe lunar habitat consisted of three Spacehab modules and a descent stage. It also would have contained other equipment such as solar panels, radiators and communications equipment.\n\nThe ascent stage was to have been used by the crew to return to a lunar orbit from the surface of the Moon. Unlike the Lunar Module of the Apollo Program, the ascent stage was not to have maintained a breathable atmosphere. Because of this, a protective space suit would have to be worn throughout the flight to protect the astronaut from the harsh conditions of space.\n\nThe main mission hardware components would have been assembled in a low Earth orbit. Then the \"stack\" would have boosted to a lunar orbit. The astronauts would have transferred from the lunar transfer vehicle to the ascent stage. After a deorbit and braking burn, the lunar base habitat and the ascent stage would have been landed on the lunar surface. Following this, the crew would have unpacked and set up the new lunar base for future operations. Once the lunar operations were completed, the crew was to transfer to the ascent stage, where they were to enter into a lunar orbit and dock with the lunar transfer vehicle where they would have remained for the journey back to Earth.\n\nOnce a base had been built on the Moon it was hoped that a lunar hotel would have been established. However it is not known how economically feasible this would have been because low-cost access to space (possibly involving single-stage-to-orbit or two-stage-to-orbit vehicles) had yet to be developed.\n\n"}

{"id": "1872140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872140", "title": "Blacker Bombard", "text": "Blacker Bombard\n\nThe Blacker Bombard, also known as the 29mm Spigot Mortar, was an infantry anti-tank weapon devised by Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart Blacker in the early years of the Second World War.\n\nIntended as a means to equip Home Guard units with an anti-tank weapon in case of German invasion, at a time of grave shortage of weapons, it was accepted only after the intervention of Churchill. Although there were doubts about the effectiveness of the Bombard, many were issued. Few, if any, saw combat.\n\nWith the end of the Battle of France and the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from the port of Dunkirk between 26 May and 4 June 1940, a German invasion of Great Britain seemed likely. However, the British Army was not well-equipped to defend the country in such an event; in the weeks after the Dunkirk evacuation it could field only twenty-seven divisions. (The German Army had more than 100 divisions at that time.) The Army was particularly short of anti-tank guns, 840 of which had been left behind in France, and only 167 were available in Britain; ammunition was so scarce for the remaining guns that regulations forbade even a single round being used for training purposes.\n\nGiven these shortcomings, those modern weapons that were available were allocated to the British Army, and the Home Guard was forced to supplement the meagre amount of outdated weapons and ammunition they had with \"ad hoc\" weapons. One of these was the Blacker Bombard, designed by Lieutenant Colonel Stewart Blacker, the origins of which went back to the 1930s. During the early part of the 1930s, Blacker became interested in the concept of the spigot mortar. Unlike conventional mortars the spigot mortar did not possess a barrel, and instead there was a steel rod known as a 'spigot' fixed to a baseplate; the bomb itself had a propellant charge inside its tail. When the mortar was to be fired, the bomb was pushed down onto the spigot, which exploded the propellant charge and blew the bomb into the air.\n\nBlacker began to experiment with the concept in the hopes of creating a platoon mortar that was lighter in weight than the one used by the British Army at the time. This evolved into the Arbalest, which he submitted to the Army but was rejected for a Spanish design. Undeterred by this rejection, Blacker went back to the design and came up with the idea of an anti-tank weapon, although he was initially stymied in his attempts to design one because the spigot design failed to generate the required velocity to penetrate armour. However he was eventually successful in creating an anti-tank mortar, which he named the Blacker Bombard.\n\nWhen the Second World War began, Blacker was a lieutenant-colonel in the Territorial Army. He had offered his Bombard to the War Office for two years without success but was introduced to the government department of Military Intelligence Research (MIRc) later known as MD1, which had been given the task of developing and delivering weapons for use by guerilla and resistance groups in Occupied Europe. Blacker showed his list of ideas to the head of MD1, Major Millis Jefferis, who was taken with the design for the Bombard. He argued that it could serve in an anti-tank and artillery capability, and claimed that it would have similar anti-tank properties to the 2 pounder anti-tank gun coupled with approximately the same range as the 3 inch mortar. Objections were raised by the Director of Artillery and other government officials, but on 18 August 1940 the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, attended a demonstration of the weapon. Churchill took a liking to the weapon and ordered it into full production. It would act as a temporary anti-tank weapon for the Home Guard until more 2 pounders could be supplied to them.\n\nIt was decided by General Headquarters Home Forces that Bombards would be useful as an anti-tank weapon for use by regular forces, as well as the Home Guard. General Alan Brooke entertained doubts about the weapon's effectiveness, but believed that its simplicity would allow it to be used by younger soldiers. In Southern Command, 14,000 were ordered for use by forces in that area; twenty-four were to be issued to anti-tank regiments, twelve to troops assigned to guard aerodromes, eight per brigade and two for each Home Guard company. However, RAF personnel were forbidden from using the weapons, a restriction which was extended to the RAF Regiment when it was formed in 1942.\n\nThe Bombard was a 29mm spigot mortar, weighing between 112 and 360 lb, placed on top of a swivel or pivot. It was able to fire a 20 lb high-explosive bomb to a range of approximately 100 yards; when the bomb detonated, it was able to inflict significant damage on a tank, although it was unlikely to actually pierce the vehicle's armour as the projectile was not able to gain sufficient velocity. It was served by a crew of between three and five men The Bombard was considered to be most effective at short range, with targets being engaged with 'considerable success' at a range of between 75–100 yards. It was a muzzle-loaded weapon and therefore had a slow rate of fire, averaging between six and twelve rounds per minute; as such it was considered vital that the weapon be well-camouflaged and that it hit the target with the first shot. Two types of ammunition were provided for the weapon – a 20 lb anti-tank bomb and a lighter 14 lb anti-personnel bomb, with each weapon being issued with 150 rounds of the former and 100 of the latter. The anti-tank rounds were found to\npossess several problems. They had insensitive fuzes, which meant that they would often pass through an unarmoured target without detonating, and when they did explode fragments were often thrown back at the crew. The Bombard was either affixed to a large cruciform platform, or an immobile concrete pedestal; in either case would usually be placed in range of defensive positions, such as road-blocks. It seems that there was a preference for the Bombard to be used primarily in a static role, with extra mountings being built by the Royal Engineers to provide alternative positions from which the weapon could be fired. In a static position, the weapon was usually emplaced in a pit with ammunition lockers nearby.\n\nThe first Bombards appeared in late 1941, and were issued to both regular and Home Guard units; in Southern Command, no more were issued after July 1942. By that time, approximately 22,000 of the Bombards had been produced and issued to forces throughout the country. By November 1941, concerns were already being aired about the suitability of the weapon and it was unpopular with a number of units; some attempted to trade their Bombards for Thompson submachine guns or refused to use them at all. However, Mackenzie cites the argument of the historian of the Ministry of Food Home Guard battalion, who stated that the issuing of the Bombard meant that the Home Guard was being taken seriously by the government. Mackenzie also argues that the Bombard did have a positive side, as it equipped otherwise unarmed Home Guard personnel with a weapon, and was a 'public relations' success. It would appear that a number of Bombards saw action with the British Army, being used in an anti-personnel role in the Western Desert Campaign, although their use may have been limited due to their weight. The design of the Bombards was the basis for the Royal Navy anti-submarine weapon known as the Hedgehog.\n\nLarge numbers of fixed concrete pedestals for Bombards were installed and a significant number survive in their original positions in many parts of the United Kingdom. The \" Defence of Britain Project\", a late-1990s field survey of 20th century military landscape features by the Council for British Archaeology, recorded a total of 351 surviving pedestals.\n\nSome of the users of the Blacker Bombard included:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1872146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872146", "title": "Boston campaign", "text": "Boston campaign\n\nThe Boston campaign was the opening campaign of the American Revolutionary War, taking place primarily in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. The campaign began with the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, in which the local colonial militias interdicted a British government attempt to seize military stores and leaders in Concord, Massachusetts. The entire British expedition suffered significant casualties during a running battle back to Charlestown against an ever-growing number of militia.\n\nSubsequently, accumulated militia forces surrounded the city of Boston, beginning the Siege of Boston. The main action during the siege, the Battle of Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775, was one of the bloodiest encounters of the war, and resulted in a Pyrrhic British victory. There were also numerous skirmishes near Boston and the coastal areas of Boston, resulting in loss of life, military supplies, or both.\n\nIn July 1775, George Washington took command of the assembled militia and transformed them into a more coherent army. On March 4, 1776, the colonial army fortified Dorchester Heights with cannon capable of reaching Boston and British ships in the harbor. The siege (and the campaign) ended on March 17, 1776, with the permanent withdrawal of British forces from Boston. To this day, Boston celebrates March 17 as Evacuation Day.\n\nIn 1767, the British Parliament passed the Townshend Acts, which imposed import duties on paper, glass, paint, and other common items imported into the American colonies. The Sons of Liberty and other Patriot organizations responded with a variety of protest actions. They organized boycotts of the goods subject to the duty, and they harassed and threatened the customs personnel who collected the duties, many of whom were either corrupt or related to Provincial leaders. Francis Bernard, then Governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, requested military forces to protect the King's personnel. In October 1768, British troops arrived in the city of Boston and occupied the city. Tensions led to the Boston Massacre on March 5, 1770, and the Boston Tea Party on December 16, 1773.\n\nIn response to the Tea Party and other protests, Parliament enacted the Intolerable Acts to punish the colonies. With the Massachusetts Government Act of 1774 it effectively abolished the provincial government of Massachusetts. General Thomas Gage, already the commander-in-chief of British troops in North America, was also appointed governor of Massachusetts and was instructed by King George's government to enforce royal authority in the troublesome colony. However, popular resistance compelled the newly appointed royal officials in Massachusetts to resign or to seek refuge in Boston. Gage commanded four regiments of British regulars (about 4,000 men) from his headquarters in Boston, but the countryside was largely controlled by Patriot sympathizers.\n\nOn September 1, 1774, British soldiers removed gunpowder and other military supplies in a surprise raid on a powder magazine near Boston. This expedition alarmed the countryside, and thousands of American Patriots sprang into action, amid rumors that war was at hand. Although it proved to be a false alarm, this event—known as the Powder Alarm—caused all concerned to proceed more carefully in the days ahead, and essentially provided a \"dress rehearsal\" for events seven months later. Partly in response to this action, the colonists carried off military supplies from several forts in New England and distributed them among the local militias.\n\nOn the night of April 18, 1775, General Gage sent 700 men to seize munitions stored by the colonial militia at Concord. Several riders — including Paul Revere — alerted the countryside, and when the British troops entered Lexington on the morning of April 19, they found 77 minutemen formed up on the village common. Shots were exchanged, eight Minutemen were killed, the outnumbered colonial militia dispersed, and the British moved on to Concord. At Concord, the troops searched for military supplies, but found relatively little, as the colonists, having received warnings that such an expedition might happen, had taken steps to hide many of the supplies. During the search, there was a confrontation at the North Bridge. A small company of British troops fired on a much larger column of colonial militia, which returned fire, and eventually routed the British, who returned to the village center and rejoined the other troops there. By the time the \"redcoats\" or \"lobster backs\" (as the British soldiers were called) began the return march to Boston, several thousand militiamen had gathered along the road. A running fight ensued, and the British detachment suffered heavily before reaching Charlestown. With the Battle of Lexington and Concord — the \"shot heard 'round the world\" — the war had begun.\n\nIn the aftermath of the failed Concord expedition, the thousands of militiamen that had converged on Boston remained. Over the next few days, more arrived from further afield, including companies from New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. Under the command of Artemas Ward, they surrounded the city, blocking its land approaches and putting the occupied city under siege. The British regulars fortified the high points in the city.\n\nWhile the British were able to resupply the city by sea, supplies in Boston were short. Troops were sent out to some of the islands in Boston Harbor to raid farmers for supplies. In response, the colonials began clearing those islands of supplies useful to the British. One of these actions was contested by the British in the Battle of Chelsea Creek, but it resulted in the loss of two British soldiers and the British ship \"Diana\". The need for building materials and other supplies led Admiral Samuel Graves to authorize a Loyalist merchant to send his ships from Boston to Machias in the District of Maine, accompanied by a Royal Navy schooner. The Machias townspeople rose up, seizing the merchant vessels and then the schooner after a short battle in which its commander was killed. Their resistance and that of other coastal communities led Graves to authorize an expedition of reprisal in October whose sole significant act was the Burning of Falmouth. The outrage in the colonies over this action contributed to the passing of legislation by the Second Continental Congress that established the Continental Navy.\n\nThe colonial army also had issues with supply, and with command. Its diverse militias needed to be organized, fed, clothed, and armed, and command needed to be coordinated, as each militia leader was responsible to his province's congress.\n\nWashington wanted to both retaliate for the British Burning of Falmouth as well as interrupt and acquire British armaments approaching Boston. Toward this end, in October 1775, General Washington ordered the first American naval expedition. Washington borrowed two vessels from John Glover's Marblehead Regiment. Glover recruited Captain Nicholson Broughton in the \"Hancock\" and Captain John Selman (privateer) in the . There expedition north led to capturing fishing vessels off Canso, Nova Scotia and the Raid on Charlottetown (1775).\n\nLate in May, General Gage received by sea about 2,000 reinforcements and a trio of generals who would play a vital role in the war: William Howe, John Burgoyne, and Henry Clinton. They formulated a plan to break out of the city, which was finalized on June 12. Reports of these plans made their way to the commanders of the besieging forces, who decided that additional defensive steps were necessary.\n\nOn the night of June 16–17, 1775, a detachment of the colonial army stealthily marched onto the Charlestown peninsula, which the British had abandoned in April, and fortified Bunker Hill and Breed's Hill. On June 17, British forces under General Howe attacked and seized the Charlestown peninsula in the Battle of Bunker Hill. This battle was technically a British victory, but losses (about 1/3 the attacking forces killed or wounded, including a significant fraction of the entire British officer corps in all of North America) were so heavy that the attack was not followed up. The siege was not broken, and General Gage was recalled to England in September and replaced by General Howe as the British commander-in-chief.\n\nThe Second Continental Congress, meeting in Philadelphia, had received reports of the situation outside Boston when it began to meet in May 1775. In response to the confusion over command in the camps there, and in response to the May 10 capture of Fort Ticonderoga, the need for unified military organization became clear. Congress officially adopted the forces outside Boston as the Continental Army on May 26, and named George Washington its commander-in-chief on June 15. Washington left Philadelphia for Boston on June 21, but did not learn of the action at Bunker Hill until he reached New York City.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Bunker Hill, the siege was effectively stalemated, as neither side had either a clearly dominant position, or the will and materiel to significantly alter its position. When Washington took command of the army in July, he determined that its size had reduced from 20,000 to about 13,000 men fit for duty. He also established that the battle had severely depleted the army's powder stock, which was eventually alleviated by powder shipments from Philadelphia. The British were also busy bringing in reinforcements; by the time of Washington's arrival the British had more than 10,000 men in the city.\n\nThroughout the summer and fall of 1775, both sides dug in, with occasional skirmishes, but neither side chose to take any significant action. Congress, seeking to take some initiative and to capitalize on the capture of Ticonderoga, authorized an invasion of Canada, after several letters to the inhabitants of Canada were rejected by the French-speaking and British colonists there. In September, Benedict Arnold led 1,100 troops on an expedition through the wilderness of Maine, which was drawn from the army assembled outside Boston.\n\nWashington faced a personnel crisis toward the end of 1775, as most of the troops in the army had enlistments that expired at the end of 1775. He introduced a number of recruitment incentives and was able to keep the army sufficiently large to maintain the siege, although it was by then smaller than the besieged forces.\n\nBy early March 1776, heavy cannons that had been captured at Fort Ticonderoga were moved to Boston, a difficult feat engineered by Henry Knox. When the guns were placed on Dorchester Heights in the course of one day, overlooking the British positions, the British situation became untenable. While General Howe planned an attack to reclaim the high ground, a snowstorm prevented its execution. The British, after threatening to burn the city if their departure was hindered, evacuated the city on March 17, 1776 and sailed for temporary refuge in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The local militias dispersed and, in April, General Washington took most of the Continental Army to fortify New York City and the start of the New York and New Jersey campaign.\n\nThe British were essentially driven from New England as a result of this campaign, although there (as elsewhere in the colonies) they continued to receive support from local Loyalists, especially in Newport, Rhode Island, from which they drove most of the local Patriots. The campaign, as well as the final result of the war as a whole, were a significant blow to British prestige and confidence in its military. The senior military leaders of the campaign were criticized for their actions (Clinton, for example, while he went on to command the British forces in North America, would take much of the blame for the British loss of the war), and others either saw no more action in the war (Gage), or were ultimately disgraced (Burgoyne, who surrendered his army at Saratoga). While the British continued to control the seas, and had military successes on the ground (notably in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania), their actions that led to these conflicts had the effect of uniting the Thirteen Colonies in opposition to the crown. As a result, they were never able to marshal enough support from Loyalists to regain meaningful political control of the colonies.\n\nThe colonies, in spite of their differences, united themselves as a consequence of these events, granting the Second Continental Congress (predecessor to the modern U.S. Congress) sufficient authority and funding to conduct the revolution as a unified whole, including funding and outfitting the military forces that formed as a result of this campaign.\n"}

{"id": "1872181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872181", "title": "Gilles Larrain", "text": "Gilles Larrain\n\nGilles Larrain (Dec 5, 1938) is a French-American photographer who believes photography is a way to “capture the landscape of the soul of a person.” By taking a unique approach to photography, which includes creating his own lighting, managing the entire darkroom process, and always having subjects come to his personal studio space, Larrain has created acclaimed pieces of art since 1969. In 1973, Larrain published the highly successful photographic book, \"Idols\", which presented portraits of transvestites. Two generations later, the book inspired American photographer Ryan McGinley who wrote an April 2010 article in Vice Magazine, which identified Larrain and the book \"Idols\" as one of his early and biggest influences for experimenting with colors, casting, and props, because all of Larrain's images in the book are raw without any manipulation. Larrain has photographed notable personalities in a wide range of creative disciplines, including the dancers of the American Ballet Theatre, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Salvador Dali, Miles Davis, Sting, Billy Joel, Roberto Rossellini, Norman Mailer, and more.\n\nBorn in Dalat, Indochina (now Vietnam) on December 5, 1938, Gilles Larrain began an atypical life moving to Chile, Argentina, Canada, France, and the United States, all before the age of 16.\n\nHis father, Hernán Larrain, was a diplomat with the Chilean consul in Vietnam and a painter. His mother, Charlotte Mayer-Blanchy, was a French-Vietnamese pianist and painter. He is the great, great grandson of Paul Blanchy, the first mayor of Saigon (1895-1901) and the first pepper producer of Vietnam. He is the grandnephew of Rafael Larrain, the cardinal of Talca (Chile).\n\nLarrain quickly learned multiple languages every two years and cultivated personal insights throughout his global experiences. His education took on a more traditional slant, beginning with the Lycee Francais de New York (1954-1957). He met his first wife, Anne-Marie Maluski, whose father brought Michelin tires to the US. The couple divorced a few years later and Anne-Marie became a published children's author under the name, Anne-Marie Chapouton.\n\nShortly after he received a French Baccalaureate at Lycée Français, he spent brief periods of time at M.I.T. and New York University, and eventually at Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Paris where he studied architecture and worked in city planning (1960-1965). He also continued drawing and painting.\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Larrain was a pioneer in kinetic art, using air, smoke, light, inflatable structures, water and neon tubes as means of artistic expression. In 1963, Larrain traveled to Oaxaca to study in Monte Alban and Mitla, where he realized drawing was insufficient to capture everything needed for information — photography became the essential medium to ask the right questions and get the right answers. Here, Larrain learned to use the camera to create pictures that magnified emotions. From this point, he decided to become an architect of the image.\n\nLarrain's second marriage was to Marie Christine Bon in 1965 and they had a daughter, Olivia, in 1968. His third marriage was to Isabella Coco Cummings in 1989 and together they had a son, Lasco, in 1991. He is currently married to textile and couture designer, known by her first name, Louda, whom he married in 2006.\n\nLarrain's first one-man painting show was held in New York City at the Southampton East Gallery on 72nd Street in 1966. In addition to photography, Larrain began to add additional visual art forms. His paintings explored the space of shapes, colours, and materials; his kinetic art explored the space of light and volumes through neons and inflatable structure, which he showcased at the fifth Biennale de Paris “Espaces dynamiques en constant mouvement” and won the Les Levine prize with Francois Dallegret for their common work, Tubalair, at the sixth Biennale in 1969.\n\nIn 1968, \"The New York Post Daily Magazine\" featured an article about Larrain written by Nora Ephron. He also appeared at the Annual Avant Garde Festival of New York established by cellist and performance artist, Charlotte Moorman, and Korean American artist, Nam June Paik. Larrain began photographing full-time in 1969, which included commercial work for clients, such as Club Med, GTE, Lavazza, Knoll International, Joel Name Eyewear, American Ballet Theatre, Renault, as well as magazines, such as \"Esquire Magazine\", \"Vogue\", Oui, \"Rolling Stone\", \"Time Magazine\", \"New York Magazine\" and more.\n\nIn 1973, Larrain published the highly successful and controversial book, \"Idols\", which presented portraits of New York's most talented, outrageous, glamorous transvestites, and mostly gay personalities, who posed in his legendary SoHo studio. \"Idols\" is an authentic compendium of 1970s Warhol-era New York style and attitude, featuring Holly Woodlawn, members of the San Francisco-based psychedelic drag queen performance troupe, the Cockettes, Taylor Meade, and John Noble.\n\nThroughout the 1980s and later, Larrain's portraiture style was constantly sought after by luminaries, including Miles Davis, Sting, Billy Joel, John Lennon, Yoko Ono, Jerry Rubin, Glenn Close, Norman Mailer, Mikhail Baryshnikov, publisher Maurice Girodias, Joe Cocker, wife of the late Shah of Iran, former Queen of Iran Farah Diba Pahlavi, Salvador Dali, and more. His skills were also used to create album covers for musicians. His subjects have ranged from dancers and musicians to artists and celebrities to friends and even a murderer, Michael Alig. Larrain insisted on mastering the entire photography process from taking shots on the camera all the way through the darkroom, so rather than meeting models in their own environment, subjects came to Larrain's studio to be photographed. Larrain aimed to capture the emotional background in addition to light, extracting what he wanted to extract. In 1982, Larrain worked with Robert Mapplethorpe, Deborah Turbeville, and Roy Volkmann on the book, “Exquisite Creatures,” which was published in 1985 by William Morrow & Company, Inc., focusing on the ineffable beauty of woman through a series of nude portraits.\n\nIn 1983, Larrain planned to visit Spain for a couple of weeks to photograph flamenco for \"GEO Magazine\". He ended up staying more than two months in the attic of La Carboneria, a flamenco venue in Seville, as a guest to the owner, Paco Lira, recognized as a godfather in the flamenco world. Captivated by the flamenco aesthetic, Larrain used his camera to capture the soul of flamenco in one of those rare artistic conjunctions where technical wisdom and experience become melded with the most difficult to express emotions. Larrain has also been playing flamenco guitar player since 1960, often playing at various events, including the Art Salon Parties he would regularly host at the SoHo live-work space shared with his current wife, Louda. Their shared studio was 7 metres high with three intermediate floors, no windows showing anything of the outside world, and art displayed everywhere. These events were opportunities for new and established artists to meet and share creative collaborations. From 1996-2005, Larrain taught “The Intimate Portrait” course for International Center for Photography (ICP) at his studio.\n\nLarrain now lives on Kauai, Hawaii with Louda. Together, they are developing a photography project, Dark Angel. He is in the process of publishing a book of his works, \"Stories by a Memory Maker\", and continues to create. Much of his work is available for viewing on Behance.\n\n\n\"Books By Gilles Larrain\"\n\n\"Books Featuring Gilles Larrain\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1872199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872199", "title": "Roman Umbria", "text": "Roman Umbria\n\nRoman Umbria is a modern name for one of the 11 administrative regions into which the emperor Augustus divided Italy. The main source for the regions is the \"Historia Naturalis\" of Pliny the Elder, who informs his readers he is basing the geography of Italy on the \"discriptio Italiae\", \"division of Italy,\" made by Augustus. The \"Sexta Regio\" (\"6th Region\") is called \"Umbria complexa agrumque Gallicam citra Ariminium\", \"Umbria including the Gallic country this side of Rimini.\"\n\nUmbria is named after an Italic people, the Umbri, who were gradually subjugated by the Romans in the 4th through the 2nd centuries BC. Although it passed the name on to the modern region of Umbria, the two coincide only partially. Roman Umbria extended from Narni in the South, northeastward to the neighborhood of Ravenna on the Adriatic coast, thus including a large part of central Italy that now belongs to the Marche; at the same time, it excluded the Sabine country (generally speaking, the area around modern Norcia) and the right bank of the Tiber, which formed part of Roman Etruria: for example Perusia (the modern Perugia) was not part of Roman Umbria; on the contrary Sarsina, Plautus birthplace, was considered to be \"in Umbria\", while today it is in the modern province of Forlì-Cesena, in Emilia-Romagna.\n\nThe importance of Umbria in Roman and medieval times was intimately bound up with the Via Flaminia, the consular road that supplied Rome and served as a military highway into and out of the City: for this reason once the Roman empire collapsed, Umbria became a strategic battleground fought over by the Church, the Lombards and the Byzantines, and suffered consequently, becoming partitioned among them and disappearing from history. The modern use of \"Umbria\" is due to a renaissance of local identity in the 17th century.\n\nBefore its defeat by and assimilation to the Romans, Umbria was a sovereign state populated by a people speaking the Umbrian language. This circumstance prevailed in history during the early and middle Roman Republic. By the late republic, Umbria was part of Rome. The language was no longer generally spoken.\n\nLike any other region, over the centuries \"Region VI\" changed its borders. These changes are reflected in the writings of the imperial geographers.\n\nThe \"sexta regio\" is described in some detail by Pliny the Elder.\n\nGallia Togata went along the northern Adriatic coast of Italy in Marche from Ancona to \"this side of Rimini.\" The southernmost point of Gallia Togata is Ancona. He mentions the Aesis River (Esino) north of there, Senagallia (Sinigaglia), Pisaurum (Pesaro) and then Fanum (Fano) at the mouth of the Metaurus (Metauro) River.\n\nThere follows a folk-etymologic statement concerning the name of the Umbri. People believe, he says, that they are named from the thunderstorms (\"imbres\") of the deluge and therefore that they are the oldest people on Earth. (The ancient Greeks and Romans inherited a mythological tradition of a deluge independent of that of the Old Testament.) Some of his further statements appear to be equivocal, leading to some historical misidentification of Gallia Togata. He declares:\"The largest part of this district was occupied by Sicilians and Liburnians especially the territories of Palma, Praetutia and Adria.\"\nThis Adria (\"Hadrianus\") is Atri, Italy on the coast of Abruzzi south of Ancona. \"Praetutia\" is \"Interamnia Praetutia\", capital city of the Petrutii. From Interamnea comes Teramo and from Praetutia comes \"Aprutium\", later \"Abruzzo\". The coast of Abruzzo was in Augustus' Region IV; however, Pliny does not say that the Abruzzo was the largest part of Gallia Togata, only that it was the largest part of the region settled by Sicilians and Liburnians. Similarly if \"Hadrianus\" is taken to be Adria in Veneto then Gallia Togata would appear to be a synonym for all Gallia Cisalpina. However, Veneto is not \"this side of Rimini.\"\n\nPliny states his belief that the Umbrians once held the north Adriatic coast, displacing Sicilians and Liburnians, and were in turn displaced by the Etruscans. The Gauls expelled them. Romans colonized the Gallic coast to control it, hence \"togata.\"\n\nFor Umbria proper Pliny simply lists the settlements: Spello, Todi, Amelia, Attiglio, Assisi, Arna, Iesi, Camerino, Casuentillum, Carsulae, Dolates Sallentini, Foligno, Market of Flaminius, Market of Julius, Market Brenta, Fossombrone, Gubbio, Terni, etc.\n\nPtolemy, 2nd century geographer, does not lump Gallia Togata together with Umbria, but describes them as separate regions.\n\nIn Ptolemy, Ancona is in Picenum. The strip of country \"above\" the Apennines, \"extending as far as Ravenna,\" is Gallia Togata. Thirteen towns are listed for it, which are south of the Po River, but are as far inland as Piacenza. This region is somewhat larger than the one of the same name in Augustus' time, comprising almost all of Emilia-Romagna. The towns are: Piacenza, Fidenza, Brescello, Parma, etc.\n\nFor the Umbri Ptolemy has only nine towns, omitting some of the major ones: Arna, Spello, Todi, etc.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1872202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872202", "title": "Miami Open (tennis)", "text": "Miami Open (tennis)\n\nThe Miami Open (also known as the Miami Masters, and currently branded as the Miami Open presented by Itaú for sponsorship reasons) is a tennis tournament held at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. It is part of the men's ATP Tour Masters 1000 circuit, and is a Premier Mandatory event on the women's WTA Tour.\n\nThe tournament had historically been held at the Tennis Center at Crandon Park in Key Biscayne, Florida from 1987 through 2018, before moving to Miami Gardens for 2019. Behind the Indian Wells Masters, it is the second event of the \"Sunshine Double\"—a series of two consecutive hard court tournaments in the United States at the beginning of the season, which both are the only tournaments besides majors where main draw play extends beyond eight days.\n\nIn 2010, a record 300,000 visitors attended matches at the 12-day tournament, making it one of the largest tennis tournaments outside the four Grand Slams. In 2011, 316,267 visitors attended the Open.\n\nThe initial idea of holding an international tennis tournament in Miami was born in the 1960s, when famous tennis players such as Pancho Gonzalez, Jack Kramer, Pancho Segura, Frank Sedgman, and Butch Buchholz toured across the country in a station wagon, playing tennis in fairgrounds with portable canvas court. The tournament officially was founded by former player Butch Buchholz who was executive director of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) in the 1980s. His original aim was to make the event the first major tournament of the year (the Australian Open was held in December at that time), and he dubbed it the \"Winter Wimbledon\". Buchholz approached the ATP and the WTA, offering to provide the prize-money and to give them a percentage of the ticket sales and worldwide television rights in return for the right to run the tournament for 15 years. The two associations agreed.\n\nThe first tournament was held in February 1985 at Laver's International Tennis Resort in Delray Beach, Florida. Buchholz brought in Alan Mills, the tournament referee at Wimbledon, as the head referee, and Ted Tinling, a well-known tennis fashion designer since the 1920s, as the director of protocol. At the time, the prize money of US$1.8 million was surpassed only by Wimbledon and the US Open. The event's prize money has since grown to over $13 million.\n\nIn 1986, the tournament relocated to Boca West. After its successful second year there, Merrett Stierheim, Dade County manager and Women's Tennis Association (WTA) president, helped Buchholz in 1987 move the tournament to its long-term home in Key Biscayne for 1988. In keeping with ambitions of its founder, the tournament has been maintained as one of the premier events in pro tennis after the Grand Slams and the ATP World Tour Finals sometimes referred to as the \"Fifth Major\" up until the mid-2000s. In 1999, Buchholz sold the tournament to IMG. In 2004, the Indian Wells Masters also expanded to a multi-week 96 player field, and since then, the two events have been colloquially termed the \"Sunshine Double\".\n\nThe aging Crandon Park facility had been criticized as the slowest hardcourt on the tour, subjecting players to endless grinding rallies in extreme heat and humidity. The land on which the Crandon Park facility stands had been donated to Miami-Dade County by the Matheson family in 1992 under a stipulation that only one stadium could be built on it. The tournament organizers proposed a $50 million upgrade of Crandon Park that would have added several permanent stadiums, and the family responded with a lawsuit. In 2015, an appeals court ruled in the family's favor, preventing upgrades from being made to the aging complex. The organizers decided not to pursue further legal action and started looking for a new site. In November 2017, the Miami Open signed an agreement with Miami-Dade County to move the annual tournament from the tennis complex in Key Biscayne to Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida beginning in 2019.\n\nThe stadium is primarily used for American football; a special seating configuration was developed to use it as its main court, utilizing temporary grandstands. While it has the same number of seats as the center court at Crandon Park, it also has access to the stadium's luxury seating and suites. New permanent courts were also built on the site's parking lots, including a new grandstand court.\n\nThe tournament has had multiple sponsorships in its history. During its inaugural playing in 1985, the tournament was known as the Lipton International Players Championships and it was a premier event of the Grand Prix Tennis Tour. In 2000, the event was renamed the Ericsson Open and in 2002, the event became known as the NASDAQ-100 Open. In 2007, the tournament was renamed the Sony Ericsson Open. From 2015 to 2019, the international bank Itaú was the presenting sponsor.\n\nBeside the four Major championships, the Miami Open is one of a small number of events on the ATP and WTA tours where the main singles draw (for both the men and the women) involves more than 64 players, and where main draw play extends beyond one week. 96 men and 96 women compete in the singles competition, and 32 teams compete in each of the doubles competitions with the event lasting 12 days.\n\nIn 2006, the tournament became the first event in the United States to use Hawk-Eye to allow players to challenge close line calls. Players were allowed three challenges per set, with an additional challenge allowed for tiebreaks. The first challenge was made by Jamea Jackson against Ashley Harkleroad in the first round.\n\nFrom 1985 until 1990 and again from 1997 to 2007, the men's final was held as a best-of-five set match, similar to the Grand Slam events. After 2007 the ATP required that the handful of ATP World Tour Masters 1000 events which had best-of-five finals switch to the usual ATP best-of-three match format because several times the participants in long finals matches ended up withdrawing from tennis tournaments they were scheduled to participate in which were commencing in only two or three days. The last best-of-five set final was won by Novak Djokovic in 2007.\n\nAs an ATP World Tour Masters 1000 event, the tournament is worth up to 1000 ATP Rankings points to the singles and doubles champions. On both the ATP and the WTA, this is the third highest level of event. This is a table detailing the points and prize money allocation for each round of the 2016 Miami ATP Masters 1000 and WTA Premier Mandatory event:\n\n\n\n"}

The tournament is played on clay courts at the tennis center \"Am Rothenbaum\". For much of its history, it was contested in May, as a precursor to the French Open. Starting with the 2009 tournament, it has been held in July instead.\n\nThe inaugural edition was held at the 'Eisenbahnverein auf der Uhlenhorst' (Uhlenhorst Railway Club) and was played in a best-of-three sets format. From the second edition in 1893 onward the tournament was a best-of-five sets until 2007 when it reverted (like other non Grand Slam events) to a best-of-three sets final. The first five editions, from 1892 to 1896, were exclusively open to German and Austrian players.\n\nFrom 1898 to 1901 the German Championships were held in Bad Homburg vor der Höhe. A men's doubles event was added to the tournament in 1902.\n\nOriginally a Grand Prix Tennis Tour event, between 1978 and 1989 it was part of the Grand Prix Super Series. From 1990 to 2008 it was part of the ATP Masters Series. In 2009 the tournament was downgraded to an ATP World Tour 500 event. According to tournament officials, this seriously hinders its ability to attract top-ranking players, who are more likely to participate in tournaments that earn them more points. Tournament officials sued the ATP in 2007 to stop the downgrade but a US jury decided in 2008 that it did not constitute a breach of monopoly laws. After a court-ordered mediation the tournament saw its appeal to the verdict rejected in 2010. As the tournament stands now with its new position in the ATP calendar, it is an attractive event for many players who dislike playing on faster surfaces. Its new position will prevent top-ranked players from playing there, since it is after Wimbledon and the focus moves towards preparing for the North American summer hardcourt surface before the start of the U.S. Open.\n\nRecords Open Era\n\nRecords pre-open era\n\n\n"}

After receiving a traditional Chinese Confucian education he went on to continue studying at Tsinghua University.\n\nIn 1922, he traveled to the United States to study fine arts and literature at the Art Institute of Chicago. It was during this time that his first collection of poetry, \"Hongzhu\" (紅燭, \"Red Candle\"), was published. In 1925, he traveled back to China and took a university teaching post. In 1928, his second collection, \"Sishui\" (死水, \"Dead Water\"), was published. In the same year he joined the Crescent Moon Society and wrote essays on poetry. He also began to publish the results of his classical Chinese literature research.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, he and many other intellectuals from northeastern China migrated to Kunming, Yunnan. There he was able to continue to teach, this time in the wartime National Southwestern Associated University. Wen stopped writing poetry in 1931 and became increasingly involved in social criticism. He became politically active in 1944 in support of the China Democratic League. His outspoken nature led to his assassination by secret agents of the Kuomintang after eulogizing his friend Li Gongpu's life at Li's funeral in 1946.\n\nThere is a monument to Wen at the Yunnan Normal University campus in Kunming, as can a large statue. A small memorial to him, including a wall portrait painted from a famous picture of him smoking his pipe is found in a walkway by his former home (the site is now part of an elementary school) in the Green Lake area of Kunming. He and his wife, Gao Zhen, are buried at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery in Beijing.\n\nWen's poetry is noted for its experimentation with classical Chinese rules and forms. He modeled his poetry on that of the English poets John Keats, Alfred Tennyson, and Robert Browning, and tried to \"recapture the symbolism and ethos of premodern Chinese society\". The poems in his second collection, \"Dead Water\" (\"Sǐshuǐ\" ), have \"a haunting musicality\", and deal with the \"heartrendingly heavy\" subject of exposing social injustice and corruption.\n\nWen was credited by David Hawkes as the initiator of the cult of Qu Yuan as \"China's first patriotic poet\", writing that, \"although Qu Yuan did not write about the life of the people or voice their sufferings, he may truthfully be said to have acted as the leader of a people's revolution and to have struck a blow to avenge them. Qu Yuan is the only person in the whole of Chinese history who is fully entitled to be called 'the people's poet'.\"\n\n"}

From 16 November 2018 to 25 July 2019, Penrose served as Minister of State to Northern Ireland.\n\nPenrose was born in Sudbury, Suffolk on 22 June 1964. He was privately educated at Ipswich School and studied at Downing College, Cambridge, receiving a BA in Law in 1986. He received an MBA from Columbia University in 1991.\n\nHe was a Bank Trading Floor Risk Manager at J. P. Morgan from 1986–90, then a management consultant at McKinsey & Company from 1992–94. He was Commercial Director of the Academic Books Division at Thomson Publishing in Andover from 1995–96, then Managing Director of Schools Book Publishing at Longman (Pearson plc), publishing school textbooks for the UK and parts of Africa. He was chairman of Logotron Ltd in Cambridge. (also owned by Pearson). In 1998, he was in charge of research at the Bow Group - a UK-based independent think tank, promoting conservative opinion internationally.\n\nPenrose unsuccessfully contested the seat of Ealing Southall in the 1997 general election, before unsuccessfully contesting the seat of Weston-super-Mare in 2001. He was elected in the same seat in the 2005 general election, defeating the Liberal Democrat Brian Cotter and he retained his seat in the 2010 general election, 2015 general election and 2017 general election. He served on the Work and Pensions Committee from July 2005 to January 2009, and in 2006 was appointed joint chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Further Education and Lifelong Learning. In 2006 he was also appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to Oliver Letwin MP and in 2009 was promoted to Shadow Minister for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform.\n\nAfter his re-election in 2010 and the formation of the coalition government, Penrose served as the Minister for Tourism and Heritage from 2010 to 2012, covering the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and the London Olympic and Paralympic Games. During his tenure, he wrote and implemented the Government's Tourism Strategy; began a process to turn English Heritage's properties, such as Stonehenge, Dover Castle, Tintagel and many others, into a second National Trust; removed licences on live entertainment; sold the Tote bookmaker; protected the Lloyd's of London building with a 'Grade 1' listing amongst other activity.\n\nPenrose returned to the backbenches in 2012. He wrote a paper (We Deserve Better) on how to give people a better deal on their utilities. Less than a year later the Prime Minister invited Penrose back to a Government role with a new position as Assistant Whip (HM Treasury), before he was promoted in February 2014 as one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury (Whip). In May 2015 he became Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet Office), a role he held until July 2016. \n\nHe was opposed to Brexit prior to the 2016 referendum.

The second-oldest tournament in all of tennis (behind only Wimbledon), the men's competition is a Masters 1000 event on the ATP Tour, and the women's competition is a Premier 5 tournament on the WTA Tour. The competition is played on hard courts.\n\nThe events alternate from year to year between the cities of Montreal and Toronto. Since 1980 in odd-numbered years the men's tournament is held in Montreal, while the women's tournament is held in Toronto, and vice versa in even-numbered years. (The women's 2020 event, scheduled for August, was canceled in April because of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada.) \n\nPrior to 2011, they were held during separate weeks in the July–August period; now the two competitions are held during the same week in August. The Toronto tournament is held at the Aviva Centre and the Montreal tournament is held at the IGA Stadium.\n\nThe current singles champions as of 2019 are Rafael Nadal (def. Daniil Medvedev) and Bianca Andreescu (def. Serena Williams).\n\nThe men's tournament began in 1881, and was held at the Toronto Lawn Tennis Club, while the women's competition was first held in 1892. Of the major tennis tournaments in the world today, only Wimbledon has been around longer.\n\nPrior to 1968 the tournament was known as the Canadian National Championships. Between 1970 and 1989 it was a major event of the Grand Prix Tennis Tour as part of the Grand Prix Super Series between 1972–1973, 1978–1989. The tournament was sponsored for a number of years by tobacco brands. In the 1970s, Rothmans International was the chief sponsor, followed by Player's Limited in the 1980s, and then Du Maurier from 1997 to 2000. However, Canadian federal legislation then came into effect banning tobacco advertising. Rogers Communications, a Canadian communications and media company, took over as the new presenting sponsor.\n\nThe event was played on clay until 1979 when it switched permanently to hard courts. Both the men's and women's tournaments were played as a single combined tournament at the National Tennis Centre in Toronto until 1981, when the men's tournament was played at the Jarry Park Stadium in Montreal for the first time. Similarly 1982 was the first year in which the women's tournament was played in Montreal.\n\nIn 1989, two Canadian male tennis players, Grant Connell and Andrew Sznajder, reached the quarterfinals of the event. They were eliminated by Ivan Lendl and Andre Agassi during that round. Lendl went on to defeat Agassi in the semi-finals and John McEnroe in the finals of that edition. Lendl has been the tournament's most successful singles player, reaching the final nine times and winning the title in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1987, 1988, and 1989.\n\nIn 1995, Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras met in the final, the third of the four times that the two top-ranked men's players would meet that year, after the Australian Open and Indian Wells Masters. Agassi's tournament win helped him regain the number-one ranking, which he lost to Sampras after they played each other again at the US Open.\n\nIn 2004, the tournament became part of the US Open Series, in the build-up to the US Open grand slam tournament. The women's tournament was moved to just before the US Open grand slam tournament. Consequently, top players such as Venus and Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova often withdrew from the tournament at the last minute to rest for the upcoming US Open. In 2009, WTA CEO Stacey Allaster implemented rules reclassifying the women's event as a Premier 5 and the WTA's rules require each year-end top-10 player from 2008 to participate in at least four Premier 5 tournaments in the 2009 season, or face the threat of fines or docked ranking points. Consequently, 19 of the top 20 female players took part in the 2009 Rogers Cup draw. The ATP mandates participation for the men's tournament, as a \"1000-level\" series event.\n\nBeginning in 2011, the men's and women's Rogers Cup tournaments were held during the same week, doing away with the later tournament which was said to be too close to the US Open. The corresponding rounds of the men's and women's matches are held on the same day, though a couple of hours apart to avoid broadcast conflicts.\n\nSource: The Tennis Base\n\n\n"}

At that time, \"kharaj\" was synonymous with \"jizyah\", which later emerged as a per head tax paid by the dhimmi. Muslim landowners, on the other hand, paid only \"ushr\", a religious tithe on land, which carried a much lower rate of taxation, and \"zakat\".\n\nChanges soon eroded the established tax base of the early Arab Caliphates. Additionally, a large, but unsuccessful, expedition against the Byzantine Empire undertaken by the Umayyad caliph Sulayman in 717 brought the finances of the Umayyads to the brink of collapse. Even before Sulayman's ascent to power, the powerful governor of Iraq, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, attempted to raise revenues by demanding from Muslims a full rate of taxation, but that measure met with opposition and resentment. To address these problems, Sulayman's successor Umar II worked out a compromise in which, beginning from 719, land from which \"kharaj\" was paid could not be transferred to Muslims; instead, they could lease such land, but in that case they would be required to pay \"kharaj\" from it. With the passage of time, the practical result of that reform was that \"kharaj\" was levied on most land without regard for the cultivator's religion. The reforms of Umar II were finalized under the Abbasids and would thereafter form the model of tax systems in the Islamic state. From that time on, \"kharaj\" was also used as a general term describing all kinds of taxes: for example, the classic treatise on taxation by the 9th century jurist Abu Yusuf was called \"Kitab al-Kharaj\", i.e. \"The Book On Taxation\".\n\n20th-century Russian orientalist, A. Yu. Yakubovski, compares the land tax system of Persian Sassanids with that of the post-Islamic Caliphate era:\n\nIn the Ottoman empire, kharaj evolved into haraç, a form of poll tax on non-Muslim subjects. It was superseded by cizye.\n\n\n"}

The event started on September 18, 1899 and is the oldest tennis tournament in the United States played in its original city.\n\nThe tournament is the second largest summer tennis event in the U.S. after the U.S. Open, as its men's portion is one of nine elite Masters 1000 tournaments on the ATP Tour and its women's event is one of five Premier 5 events on the WTA Tour.\n\nThe tournament was started in 1899 as the Cincinnati Open and was renamed in 1901 to Tri-State Tennis Tournament, a name it would keep until 1969 (it would later be known by several other names, including ATP Championships), and would eventually grow into the tournament now held in Mason. The original tournament was held at the Avondale Athletic Club, which sat on property that is now Xavier University, and would later be moved to several various locations due to changes in tournament management and surfaces. The first tournament in 1899 was played on clay courts (described in a newspaper article of the time as \"crushed brick dust\"), and the event was mostly played on clay until 1978 when it switched permanently to hardcourts.\n\nIn 1903, the tournament was moved to the Cincinnati Tennis Club, where it was primarily held until 1972. In 1974, the tournament was nearly dropped from the tennis calendar but moved at the last moment to the Cincinnati Convention Center, where it was played indoors and, for the first time since 1919, without a women's draw. In 1975, the tournament moved to the Coney Island amusement park on the Ohio River, and the tournament began to gain momentum again.\n\nIn 1975, the tournament reins were taken by Paul M. Flory, then an executive with Procter & Gamble. During his tenure, the tournament enriched its considerable heritage while donating millions of dollars to charity: to Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Tennis for City Youth (a program to teach tennis to inner-city children), and to The Charles M. Barrett Cancer Center at University Hospital. Flory was honored with the ATP's Arthur Ashe Humanitarian Award, enshrinement in the USTA/Midwest Hall of Fame and the Cincinnati Tennis Hall of Fame, and was named one of the Great Living Cincinnatians by the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce. Flory began his involvement as a volunteer with the tournament in the late 1960s and remained a volunteer until the end, never accepting a salary. Flory, who was born on May 31, 1922, died on January 31, 2013, remaining tournament chairman until his final day.\n\nBetween 1981 and 1989 it was a major tournament of the men's Grand Prix Tennis Tour and part of the Grand Prix Super Series.\n\nIn 1979 the tournament moved to Mason where a permanent stadium was built and the surface was changed from Har-Tru clay to hardcourt (DecoTurf II.). Later, two other permanent stadia were constructed, making the Cincinnati Masters the only tennis tournament outside the four Grand Slam events with three stadium courts – Center Court, Grandstand Court and Court 3. A new Court 3 was built in 2010, increasing the number of stadium courts to four, with the existing Court 3 renamed Court 9. The women's competition was reinstated in 1988 for one year, and then again in 2004 when the organizers, with the help of the Octagon sports agency, bought the Croatian Bol Ladies Open and moved it to Cincinnati.\n\nIn August 2008, the men's tournament was sold to the United States Tennis Association, the owners of the US Open.\n\nIn 2002, the tournament was sponsored for the first time by Western & Southern Financial Group, with the company continuing its sponsorship until at least 2016. In 2011 the men's and women's tournaments were played at the same time making a joint tournament. As a result, the name of the competition changed from the Western & Southern Financial Group Masters and Women's Open to the Western & Southern Open.\n\nThe tournament is played at the Lindner Family Tennis Center, located in the Cincinnati suburb of Mason, Ohio. It features a total of 17 courts, including four tennis stadiums—Center Court, Grandstand Court, Court 3, and Court 10 (formerly known as Court 3)—and among the few venues (e.g with Madrid Open) other than Grand Slams with more than two permanent stadiums.\nIn 2009, the tennis tournament announced a $10 million upgrade to the facility, including the construction of a West Building to add space for players, media and fans. The new building, which opened in mid-2010 and is named the Paul M. Flory Player Center, is approximately twice as high as the previous West Building, rising above ground level and above the court level.\n\nIn 2010, the tournament announced plans to expand the grounds by more than 40% and add six new courts. One of those courts is Court 3, which serves as the third television court, while another court has seating for 2,500. A new ticket office, entry plaza, food court and exhibit areas also were added.\n\nThe venue hosts additional events including the Atlantic 10 Conference Tennis Championships, the Ohio Athletic Conference Tennis Championships, and both the boys' and girls' OHSAA state tennis championships, and has hosted an Association of Volleyball Professionals event, concerts, charitable events, and numerous regional and national junior tennis events.\n\nThe Cincinnati Masters are known as one of the more intimate environments as far as player-fan interactions go. Because the tournament is significantly smaller than the U.S. Open, many people come to see the players up close and likely will get an autograph from at least one of the athletes if they really try to. Players have occasionally been seen walking from court to court among the crowds of people who flock to see them play.\n\nThe following is the list of champions of the Cincinnati Masters.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Introduced to karting at an early age, he displayed an obvious talent for racing. After several years in the junior kart series, Schneider won the 1980 German Kart championship. Two years later, he would win the 1982 European Kart championship with the national team. In 1983, he won the African kart championship.\n\nThe next few years, Schneider would race in the various Formula Ford series in Germany and elsewhere in Europe. In 1986, he joined the German Formula Three circuit, winning the title the following year in 1987. This brought him to the attention of Erich Zakowski, who signed Schneider to drive for his Formula One team Zakspeed in and . However, the small German-based squad did little to make an impression on the F1 circuit and Schneider only able to qualify for nine races out of the 32 he entered with the team (7 out of 16 with the turbo powered car in 1988 and only twice out of 16 attempts did he pre-qualify and actually qualify for a race in 1989).

It is played indoors at the AccorHotels Arena, in the neighborhood of Bercy.\nThe event is part of the ATP Tour Masters 1000 on the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) Tour.\n\nThe tournament evolved from the French Covered Court Championships. In the open era it was held at the Stade Pierre de Coubertin until 1982. In 1989 it was upgraded to become one of the premier nine tournaments of the Grand Prix Tour (Grand Prix Super Series), replacing the Tokyo Open. The event is usually the final tournament on the tour before the season-ending ATP Finals. Because of its sponsorship, the event was officially known from 2003 to 2016 as BNP Paribas Masters, and from 2017 as the Rolex Paris Masters. Prior to the Tennis Masters Series replacing the ATP Super 9 in 2000, the event was known as the Paris Open. It is also often referred to as the Paris Indoor event in reference to both the facts that the other tennis event held in Paris, the French Open is held outdoors, and that since 2009, it is the only Masters 1000 tournament which is played indoors. From 1970 until 1986 there had usually been three indoor events amongst the top nine tournaments (then called the Grand Prix Championship Series), with there being four indoor events plus the year-end Championships from 1978 to 1980. From 1987 until 2008 there were two indoor tournaments at the Masters level.\n\nThe surface used to be one of the fastest courts in the world which rewarded bold attacking tennis, but since 2011 it has followed the general slow-down of most courts on the tour.\n\nIlie Năstase, Andre Agassi, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic are the only players to have ever won both Parisian tournaments (Bercy and the French Open).

Ayres\n\nRomeyn Beck Ayres (December 20, 1825 – December 4, 1888) was a Union Army general in the American Civil War. \n\nAyres was born at East Creek, New York, along the Mohawk River in Montgomery County. He was the son of a small-town doctor, who trained him in Latin. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1847, ranking 22nd in a class of 38, and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Artillery. Although graduating in time for the Mexican–American War, Ayres served only on garrison duty in Puebla and Mexico City until 1850, seeing no fighting in the war.\n\nBetween the wars, Ayres was stationed at various posts on the frontier and served at the Fort Monroe Artillery School from 1859 to 1861. In 1849 he married Emily Louis Gerry Dearborn in Bangor, Maine. His second wife was Juliet Opie Hopkins Butcher, the daughter of Juliet Opie Hopkins, a woman who later became prominent establishing hospitals for Confederate soldiers in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nAfter the start of the Civil War, Ayres was promoted to captain and commanded a battery in the 5th U.S. Artillery, which he led in the First Bull Run Campaign, and was heavily involved in the Battle of Blackburn's Ford, immediately before the larger First Battle of Bull Run. At First Bull Run, his battery, attached to the brigade of William Tecumseh Sherman, was held in reserve and he did not see action during the battle proper, but distinguished himself by providing cover for retreating Union Army troops pursued by Confederate cavalry.\n\nOn October 3, 1861, Ayres was appointed chief of artillery for William F. \"Baldy\" Smith's division (later designated the 2nd Division of the VI Corps) of the Army of the Potomac. He served in that position in the Peninsula Campaign, the Seven Days Battles, and at the Battle of Antietam. Just before the Battle of Fredericksburg, he was promoted to chief of artillery of the VI Corps as a brigadier general, as of November 29, 1862. At Fredericksburg he commanded the corps artillery stationed across the Rappahannock River on Falmouth Heights.\n\nWhile recuperating from an injury caused when his horse fell, Ayres considered his military career and realized that artillery officers had a much slower rate of promotion than their colleagues in the infantry. Thus, he arranged for a transfer and became a brigade commander in the 2nd Division of the V Corps as of April 21, 1863. This division was known as the Regular Division because it consisted almost entirely of regular army (versus state volunteers) soldiers and he led its 1st Brigade in the Battle of Chancellorsville. On the first day of the battle (May 1, 1863) his brigade formed the left flank of Sykes' division when it engaged Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws' division on the Orange Turnpike. Sykes' division was forced to retreat after being attacked on the right flank by Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes' division.\n\nIn the Gettysburg Campaign, as part of a general shuffling of senior officers when Maj. Gen. George Meade was promoted from commander of the V Corps to be commander of the Army of the Potomac and Maj. Gen. George Sykes took command of the corps, Ayres was promoted to command the Regular Division. He had risen to division command quickly for an officer with little infantry experience. At the Battle of Gettysburg, he did not have an opportunity to shine in his new assignment. His division arrived on the battlefield around midday on the second day of battle, July 2, 1863. After a brief rest in camp near Power's Hill, two brigades from his division were sent to reinforce Union troops from Maj. Gen. John C. Caldwell's division (II Corps), which was counterattacking Confederate forces in the Wheatfield. Due to a great Confederate assault nearby at the Peach Orchard, Caldwell's division retreated so that his two brigades were at risk of being surrounded. They were forced to retreat as well, suffering heavy casualties. Nevertheless, Ayres received praise for his performance and he received a brevet promotion to major in the regular army for his actions at Gettysburg. After the battle, the Regular Division was sent in New York City to suppress the draft riots there.\n\nIn March 1864, the Army of the Potomac was reorganized, reducing the number of corps commanders, and subordinates down the chain of command were affected. Ayres was reduced to commanding the 4th Brigade of the 1st Division, V Corps. He led the brigade in Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's Overland Campaign of 1864. He received command of a new 2nd Division of the V Corps for the Siege of Petersburg. On August 1, 1864, he received a brevet promotion to major general for his contributions in these campaigns; he received particular commendations and brevet promotions for Weldon Railroad and Five Forks. Ayres continued to lead his division through the Appomattox Campaign and the Confederate surrender.\n\nBy the summer of 1864, the Regular Division no longer existed because it was hardly above brigade strength. Ayres was asked after the war if any of the regular troops he'd commanded were still serving. He replied \"I had a division of regulars once. I buried half of them at Gettysburg and the other half in the Wilderness. There's no regulars left.\"\n\nAfter the war, Ayres commanded a division in the Provisional Corps, and then commanded the District of the Shenandoah Valley until April 30, 1866, when he was mustered out of the volunteer service. As part of the general reduction of ranks that was typical following many American wars, Ayres returned to the regular army with the rank of lieutenant colonel and he performed mostly garrison duty in a number of posts in the South, including Little Rock, Arkansas, Jackson Barracks, New Orleans, Louisiana, and Key West, Florida. In 1877 he commanded troops suppressing the railroad strikes in Maryland and Pennsylvania, and in 1879 he was promoted to colonel of the 2nd U.S. Artillery.\n\nAyres died on duty on December 4, 1888 in Fort Hamilton, New York at 62 years of age. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia, alongside his mother-in-law, Juliet Opie Hopkins.\n\n\n\n"}

Howe\n\nAlbion Parris Howe (March 13, 1818 – January 25, 1897) was a Union Army general in the American Civil War. Howe's contentious relationships with superior officers in the Army of the Potomac eventually led to his being deprived of division command.\n\nHowe was born in Standish, Maine. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1841. After serving in the 4th U.S. Artillery for two years, he taught mathematics at the U.S. Military Academy for three years.\n\nHowe served in the Mexican War and was awarded a brevet promotion in 1847 to the rank of captain for gallantry during Winfield Scott's advance upon Mexico City, especially for his actions at the Battle of Contreras and the Battle of Churubusco. He was promoted to the rank of captain on March 2, 1855. Howe served under Robert E. Lee during the suppression of John Brown at Harpers Ferry.\n\nAt the beginning of the Civil War, Howe served under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan in western Virginia. He took command of John J. Peck's 3rd Brigade, (55th New York, 62nd New York, and the 93rd, 98th, and 102nd Pennsylvania regiments) Couch's 1st Division, Keyes's IV Corps during the Seven Days Battles, after Peck was promoted to command of Silas Casey's Division of the same corps. Howe received the brevet rank of major in the regular army for his role at the Battle of Malvern Hill. He was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in the volunteer service on June 11, 1862.\n\nIn the subsequent campaigns of the Army of the Potomac, Howe fought in the Battle of South Mountain and was present at the Battle of Antietam. He was promoted to command 2nd Division, VI Corps, leading it at the Battle of Fredericksburg. His division was heavily engaged at Fredericksburg and Salem Church during the Chancellorsville Campaign. Howe's division led a reconnaissance in the vicinity of Fredericksburg on June 3, 1863, as the Union high command tried to determine whether the Army of Northern Virginia was moving out of its positions to undertake an offensive. It was only minimally engaged in the campaign culminating in the Battle of Gettysburg. His division was the last to reach the battlefield and his two brigades were assigned to opposite ends of the Union line, leaving him effectively without a command. During the pursuit of Lee's retreating army, the 1st Vermont Brigade of Howe's division fought the Confederate rear guard near Funkstown, Maryland, on July 10, 1863. Howe continued in division command during the Bristoe Campaign and the Mine Run Campaign.\n\nHowe was removed from command by Maj. Gen. George G. Meade shortly thereafter. Howe's bad relationship with his corps commander, Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick, including support of Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker in the controversies that were spawned by the Union defeat at Chancellorsville, probably contributed to this removal. Meade, if he did not initiate Howe's removal, at least did not oppose it. Howe testified against Meade and Sedgwick before the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, claiming Sedgwick spoke to him about retreating to Westminster, Maryland. Sedgwick's testimony before the committee contradicted Howe's without naming him. The committee did not pursue this contradiction. What is clear is that Sedgwick sought the services of Brig. Gen. George W. Getty to replace Howe in command of the 2nd Division.\n\nAfter leaving the Army of the Potomac, Howe commanded the artillery depot in Washington, D.C. He was in the field briefly at Harpers Ferry, opposing the raid on Washington by Confederate Lieutenant General Jubal Early.\n\nAt the close of the war, Howe served in the honor guard that stood watch over the corpse of Abraham Lincoln, and soon afterward was appointed as a member of the military commission that tried the Lincoln conspirators. Howe did not make any public comments on the conviction or hanging of Mary E. Surratt, but was not among the five officers who petitioned President Andrew Johnson to commute her sentence to life in prison. Both assignments may indicate that the Radical Republican faction in the Congress found him useful and sympathetic. He also served in the Freedmen's Bureau in 1865. Howe was mustered out of the volunteer service on July 15, 1866.\n\nHowe retired from the Army on June 30, 1882, at the rank of colonel. He was a veteran companion of the Massachusetts Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. He died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and is buried there in Mount Auburn Cemetery.\n\nHowe was married to Elizabeth, daughter of Andrew Mahaffey, a superintendent of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and Elizabeth McPherson. They had six children.\n\n\n\n"}

This allows a minor in the United States to have property set aside for the minor's benefit and may achieve some income tax benefit for the child's parents. Once the child reaches the age of maturity (18 or 21 depending on the state), the assets become the property of the child and the child can use them for any purpose. Contributing money to an UGMA account on another person's behalf could be subject to gift tax; however, the Internal Revenue Code of the United States allows persons to give up to the annual gift tax exclusion to another person without any gift tax consequences, and gifts exceeding that amount as long as total gifts are below the lifetime limits.\n\nIn the majority of states that have adopted the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA), the assets are treated similarly. The assets are held in the custodian's name until the child reaches age of maturity. States that adopted UTMA also repealed UGMA; UTMA specifically provides that contracts in UTMA states which reference UGMA are governed by UTMA. Thus, UGMA is often still referred to in contracts designed for use in multiple states, even though it may actually mean UTMA in a particular state. Under the UGMA or UTMA, the ownership of the funds works like it does with any other trust and the donor must appoint a custodian (the trustee) to look after the account for the benefit of the beneficiary.\n\nUntil 1986, a UGMA or UTMA account allowed the assets to be taxed at the minor's income tax bracket. Tax law changes in 1986, 2006, 2007 and 2017 known as the \"kiddie tax\" have substantially reduced the tax savings of UGMAs and UTMAs. Until 2018, for beneficiaries under 19 (under 24 if a student), the first $1,000 of unearned income was tax-free, the second $1,000 was taxed at the minor's rate (typically 15%), and the amount over $2,000 was taxed at the parent's rate. The current rule is that for beneficiaries under 19 (under 24 if a student), the first $1,050 of unearned income is tax-free, the second $1,050 is taxed at the minor's rate (typically 12%), and the amount over $2,100 is taxed at the ordinary and capital gains rates applicable to trusts and estates. UGMA and UTMA accounts can invest in the stock market.\n\nOne negative effect of UGMA or UTMA assets for minors who plan to attend college is that financial aid is typically reduced by 20-25% of the UGMA or UTMA balance. Some financial advisers therefore advise depleting the balance in these accounts, always for purposes benefiting the minor such as summer camp, books, computer and similar expenses, well before the minor begins the process of applying to college.\n"}

Farnsworth\n\nElon John Farnsworth (July 30, 1837 – July 3, 1863) was a Union Army captain in the American Civil War. He commanded Brigade 1, Division 3 of the Cavalry Corps (Union Army) from June 28, 1863 to July 3, 1863, when he was mortally wounded and died at the Battle of Gettysburg. He was nominated by President Abraham Lincoln for appointment to the grade of brigadier general on June 29, 1863 but was not confirmed by the United States Senate before his death at Gettysburg.\n\nFarnsworth was born in Green Oak, Michigan on July 30, 1837. \n\nElon Farnsworth's uncle, John F. Farnsworth, served in the United States House of Representatives from Illinois between March 4, 1857 and March 3, 1861 and again between March 4, 1863 and March 3, 1873. John Farnsworth was a Union Army colonel who also commanded cavalry brigades (September 1862 to February 1862) and was nominated for appointed to the grade of brigadier general (November 1862). His appointment also was not confirmed by the United States Senate after the nomination was ordered returned to President Lincoln on February 12, 1863. \n\nElon Farnsworth's family moved to Illinois in 1854. A member of the Chi Psi Fraternity, Farnsworth was expelled from the University of Michigan following a drinking party in which a classmate died after being thrown from a window. He joined the Army as a civilian foragemaster in 1857 and served on the staff of Albert Sidney Johnston during the Utah War of 1857–58. He also worked as a buffalo hunter, scout and freighter in the Colorado Territory.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Civil War, Farnsworth was appointed a first lieutenant in the 8th Illinois Cavalry, the regiment commanded by his uncle, serving with distinction throughout the early stages of the war. Being promoted to captain on December 25, 1861, he was made Assistant Chief Quartermaster of the IV Corps, and in early 1863, he served as aide-de-camp to Brigadier General Alfred Pleasonton through the Battle of Chancellorsville and early stages of the Gettysburg Campaign. Pleasanton, then in command of the Union Cavalry Corp, gave Farnsworth command of 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, Cavalry Corps, Army of the Potomac on June 28, 1863, three days before the Battle of Gettysburg. On June 29, 1863, just two days before the battle, President Lincoln nominated Farnsworth to the grade brigadier general of volunteers but the appointment was never confirmed by the United States Senate.\n\nAfter the collapse of Pickett's Charge and the defeat of Major General J.E.B. Stuart's Confederate cavalry on July 3, the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg, Brigadier General Hugh Judson Kilpatrick, commanding the 3rd Division, ordered Farnsworth to make a charge with his brigade against Confederate positions south of the Devil's Den area of the battlefield, below Little Round Top. Farnsworth initially balked, arguing there was no hope of success, and only agreed to it when Kilpatrick allegedly accused him of cowardice. Farnsworth made the charge, against elements of John B. Hood's division, under Evander M. Law (Hood having been wounded the previous day). Farnsworth rode with the second battalion of the 1st Vermont Cavalry, alongside Major William Wells.\n\nThe charge was repulsed with heavy losses, and Farnsworth himself was shot five times in the chest. An account by Confederate Colonel William C. Oates claimed that Farnsworth was surrounded by Confederate soldiers and committed suicide to avoid capture, but this has been disputed by other witnesses and discounted by most historians. Kilpatrick received much criticism for ordering the charge, but no official action was taken against him.\n\nFarnsworth is buried in Rockton Cemetery, Rockton, Illinois.\n\nBattery Farnsworth, a coastal defense built between 1897 and 1899 near Fort Constitution at New Castle, New Hampshire, was named in his honor.\n\n\n"}

The story was first published in the January 1953 issue of \"Galaxy Science Fiction\".\n\nIn 1956, the story was adapted for the radio program \"X Minus One\" by George Lefferts.\n\nEight years ago a nuclear war began between the United States and the Soviet Union. American survivors evacuated to gigantic bunkers miles under ground. Sophisticated, radioactivity-immune robots called \"leadys\" continue fighting the war on the devastated surface that is too dangerous for humans. The Soviets have similarly evacuated underground, and each side builds powerful weapons and vehicles for the remote-controlled war they only see from film that the robots deliver.\n\nThe security department asks Taylor, an American war planner, to observe the interrogation of a leady regarding the progress of the war. Although the robot reports that lethal radioactivity and sophisticated new Soviet weapons continue to make the surface dangerous for humans, the observers find that the leady is not radioactive. Taylor learns that this is the second such robot the security department has found; it assigns him to an expedition, wearing lead suits, to investigate the truth about surface conditions.\n\nTaylor's group surprises the leadys at the surface and demands to see the outside. Although the robots attempt to delay the humans as long as possible, the group discovers outside the bunker an undamaged valley with forests, animals, and a farm. The leadys reveal that the war ended as soon as the humans evacuated because the robots could not see a rational purpose for it. Analyzing history, they found that groups of humans warred with each other until they matured to overcome conflict. Humanity is almost ready for a single culture, the current worldwide division into American and Soviet sides being the final step. The leadys create counterfeit photographs of the devastated planet to fool humans, while destroying weapons they received and rebuilding the world for their creators' return.\n\nThe Americans believe that because the Soviets do not know that they were also tricked, the United States can quickly win the war. The robots reveal, however, that during their explanation they sealed all tubes to under ground. Although this prevents the expedition from leaving, the leadys expect that by the time their countrymen dig new tunnels, humanity will be ready for the truth. The robots invite Taylor and the others to join a group of Soviets who were similarly stranded after visiting the surface. \"The working out of daily problems of existence\", the leadys suggest, \"will teach you how to get along in the same world. It will not be easy, but it will be done.\"\n\nThis novelette is in the public domain in the U.S., and is available at Project Gutenberg.\n"}

He attended the Boston Latin School and graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1829, in the same class as Robert E. Lee. However, at age 28 he was older than most West Point cadets upon completion, and placed fifth out of 46 cadets. He was then commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Artillery, but spent most of his army service as an instructor of tactics and French at the Academy.\n\nBarnes married Charlotte Adams Sanford in 1832 (sister of John F. A. Sanford). After the birth of his second son, John Sanford Barnes, he resigned his commission on July 31, 1836, to become a railroad civil engineer and by 1839 he was superintendent of the Western Railroad, a job he would hold for 22 years.\n\nOn July 26, 1861, Barnes was commissioned a colonel in the 18th Massachusetts Infantry. He and his regiment joined the Army of the Potomac during the Peninsula Campaign, but saw no combat. During the Seven Days Battles the 18th was assigned to guard duty in the rear, and again Barnes saw no combat. His brigade commander, Brig. Gen. John Martindale, was relieved of command after the Battle of Malvern Hill and Barnes became the new commander of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, V Corps on July 10, 1862. For reasons unrecorded, Barnes was not present with his brigade at the Second Battle of Bull Run and although the V Corps marched to the Battle of Antietam, it was left in reserve and once again saw no action. However, during Lee's retreat back to Virginia, Barnes saw his first combat when his brigade was attacked by the rearguard of the Confederate Army, resulting in over 200 men shot or drowned in the Potomac River and over 100 more captured.\n\nAt the Battle of Fredericksburg in December, Barnes distinguished himself for the first time, leading his brigade in one of the final assaults against Confederate positions on Marye's Heights. His division commander wrote after the battle, \"James Barnes ... is entitled to special notice for his coolness, energy, and marked ability.\" On April 4, 1863, Barnes was promoted to brigadier general, U.S. Volunteers, with date of rank established as November 29, 1862. At the Battle of Chancellorsville in May, Barnes' brigade was not heavily engaged. Late in the battle, his division commander, Brig. Gen. Charles Griffin, fell ill and Barnes assumed command of the 1st Division on May 5, 1863.\n\nIn 1863 Barnes' division camped at Union Mills, Maryland, on its way to Pennsylvania, where the Battle of Gettysburg would turn out to be the most significant action in his career. The new division commander, now 61 years old (older than any other Union general present except Brig. Gen. George S. Greene), arrived early on the morning of the second day, July 2, 1863, with the rest of the V Corps. During the massive Confederate assault on the Union left flank that afternoon, one of Barnes' brigades, under Col. Strong Vincent, was diverted to defend the flank at Little Round Top. The brigade performed magnificently, but Barnes had essentially nothing to do with its actions or the decision to send it there.\n\nBarnes did get personally involved with his other two brigades, who were sent to reinforce the Union line in the Wheatfield, and here his career took a fatal downward turn. He was criticized after the battle for withdrawing his two brigades under Colonels Jacob B. Sweitzer and William S. Tilton 300 yards back from the Wheatfield without permission, despite protests from the generals on his flanks. When reinforcements from the II Corps arrived, Maj. Gen. David B. Birney gave orders for Barnes' men to lie down while the brigade of Brig. Gen. Samuel K. Zook marched over them. Sweitzer's brigade was sent into the Wheatfield, where it was attacked in the flank by another Confederate charge led by Brig. Gen. William T. Wofford. Aides could not find Barnes in the vicinity of his troops. Later that day, Barnes was wounded in the leg and although it healed, he would never return to combat duty.\n\nAfter recovering from his wound, Barnes spent the remainder of the war on garrison duty in Virginia and Maryland. This included commanding the District of St. Mary's, Maryland, which contained the prisoner-of-war camp at Point Lookout, Maryland, in the Middle Department. He was mustered out of the volunteer service on January 15, 1866. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated and on March 12, 1866 the U.S. Senate confirmed the award to Brigadier General Barnes of the honorary grade of brevet major general, U.S. Volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865.\n\nAfter the war, Barnes returned to his profession of railroad civil engineering and was a member of the government commission that supervised the building of the Union Pacific Railroad. Barnes died in Springfield, Massachusetts, and is buried there in Springfield Cemetery|.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1872289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872289", "title": "Efé people", "text": "Efé people\n\nThe Efé are a group of part-time hunter-gatherer people living in the Ituri Rainforest of the Democratic Republic of Congo. In the depths of the forest they do not wear much clothing, using only leaf huts as shelter for their bodies in the intense heat. The Efé are Pygmies, and one of the shortest peoples in the world. The men grow to an average height of 142 cm (4 ft. 8 in.), and women tend to be about 5 cm (2 in.) shorter.\n\nDr. Jean-Pierre Hallet was very involved with the Efé, from raising awareness to the plight of the tribe, to the introduction of new foods and methods previously unknown (such as a legume called the \"winged bean\" of New Guinea). He also introduced new methods of farming to the Efé, who likely had been a hunter-gatherer society for many thousands of years.\n\nThe Efé pygmies are considered by mitochondrial DNA haplotype analysis to be one of the oldest races on earth. The Semliki harpoon, 90,000 years old, is one of the oldest tools known to mankind and occurs in the natural range of the Efé pygmies. This suggests an initial aquatic civilisation based on fishing. Jean-Pierre Hallet promoted the establishment of a sanctuary for the Efé along the Semliki River near Virunga National Park, and also lobbied heavily for the rights of the semi-nomadic pygmies to continue living in the protected Okapi Wildlife Reserve in the Ituri Forest.\n\nThe Efe are one of three groups of pygmies, collectively named BaMbuti, of the Ituri forest of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The other groups are the Sua, and the Aka. Of these, the Efé occupy the most land, from the north to the southeast of the forest. One of the main ways in which these groups are distinguished is by the neighbouring non-pygmy tribes with whom they cooperate. The Efé, who differ from other pygmy groups in that they hunt with bows and arrows instead of nets, are associated with the Lese people. The Efé language is related to that of the Lese, and is Central Sudanic in origin. (The pygmy groups in the region generally speak the language of the tribes with whom they associate.)\n\nThere is some debate over how long the Efé have lived in their present state, with accounts of their having been in the Ituri forest for 20,000 years. Bailey states that the Ituri area has been inhabited since 40,700 BC, but that the region was most likely savannah and temperate forest (as opposed to rainforest) until somewhere between 2900 and 720 BC.\n\nHis analyses suggest that hunter-gathering is not a sufficient source of caloric intake alone, so that some form of agricultural pursuits were likely and that the civilization probably developed at the border of the savannah and the rainforest, rather than in the forest itself. Net hunting by other pygmy tribes, however, seem to provide higher caloric intake than the bow and arrow hunting of the Efé.\n\nSome suggestions as to the evolutionary benefit of the pygmy short stature was the ability to navigate the dense jungle, with its low hanging branches, more easily. Small stature also confers a small advantage for body heat dissipation in equatorial (hot, humid) regions. (While there are pygmy peoples in colder climates as well, this may have occurred by migration.)\n\nArab slave raids, especially from the 1850s until the 1890s, served to destabilise the region. Trade routes were opened up, and a common dialect called \"Kingwana\" (a Congo variant of Kiswahili, also known as Copperbelt Swahili) was introduced. New crops, firearms, and hut designs were also introduced during that time. The Efé assumed roles as watchmen for the Lese against the slavers.\n\nBelgian Congo was established in 1908, and the Belgian colonial government played a role in shaping the lives of the Efé and Lese. Chiefdoms among the Lese were formalised and police forces were created with Lese policemen. These supervised the work projects of the colonial administration: primarily the construction of three main roads in the Ituri region. Whole villages of Lese and Efé were relocated alongside these roads in these work projects, and new crops were planted for sale as well as for village use. The structure of these roadside villages and the resultant behaviour of the Efé differed significantly from their forest villages.\n\nWhen Congo became independent from Belgium on June 30, 1960, the Ituri region began to fall into decay. The dictatorship of Mobutu that soon followed independence followed a practice of neglect for the region, allowing the roads to fall into disrepair. \"...We have no roads, we have no insurrection\" was one of his favourite sayings. In 1997 he died of prostate cancer and the rebel army of Laurent Kabila took control of the country in the First Congo War. This was soon followed by Rwandan and Ugandan invasions of the Eastern Congo in the Second Congo War. Congolese militias known as Mai Mai also sprang up and began fighting in this conflict, and the Ituri region was one of the areas most affected by this conflict, the largest in Africa.\n\nThe Efé are primarily a foraging society, but they do sometimes perform wage labour for the Lese villagers. Efé men hunt and gather honey while the women gather food and also fish.\n\nRecently, the Ituri forest is being logged at a tremendous rate, and Efé have been hired to assist with the logging.\n\nHunting is a primary way in which Efé men contribute to the food supply of the tribe, which they were observed doing 21.1% of the time during 12-hour observation days. They hunt either alone or in groups, using either spears or bows and arrows (the arrows may be iron-tipped or poison-tipped, depending on the type of prey). Monkeys are hunted alone using poison-tipped arrows, which is done by solitary hunters who locate groups of monkeys feeding in trees and stand where they think the monkeys will move. Once they are within , an Efé archer fires several arrows and, if he hits one of the monkeys, he will either try to follow it up to through the forest (waiting for the poison to set in), or he will return later (the same day or the next morning) in order to bring it back to camp. Poison-tipped arrows are labour-intensive to make (the poisonous roots and vines have to be gathered and then crushed up to turn them into a juice that can be used to coat the arrow tip), and are made in batches of about 75, with about 5.9 minutes spent on each arrow. Duikers (a type of antelope) are hunted either in groups or ambushed alone from trees with iron-tipped arrows. The ambush hunts are called \"ebaka\", and they are performed by building perches in fruit trees from which the duikers eat dropped fruits and waiting there during feeding hours, which are early morning and late afternoon. If the hunter hits a duiker, he will jump out of the 2.5- to 3-metre perch and chase it, and call the dogs to join him. Sometimes, though, the animal gets away, since they can run the distance of several football fields away in the dense forest, even wounded. Group hunts, which are called \"mota\", take place with between 4 and 30 men who use either spears for large animals (like forest buffalo and elephants) or iron-tipped arrows for duikers, other species of antelope, and water chevrotain. They also use their dogs to drive game out of their hiding and/or sleeping places and to chase down wounded animals.\n\nAnother exclusively male task is to gather honey, which takes place from June through September. Honey season, however, can last until November if it is a particularly plentiful season. Women perform most tasks unrelated to hunting and honey-gathering. These include gathering firewood and water, which women do about 5 percent of the time. Generally, they do this with at least one other person, very occasionally a man. Gathering forest foods, namely fruits, nuts, tubers, mushrooms, caterpillars, and termites takes up a lot of their time, as does labouring in the villages. Women also spend 17% of their time preparing food, and are almost solely responsible for maintaining the camp.\n\nOne interesting feature of the family life of the Efé is the degree of cooperation involved in caring for children, particularly babies. Sometimes Efé infants will even be nursed by a woman other than the mother if the mother's milk has not come in yet. Other women help more in caretaking than the baby's father, and studies indicate that Efé babies spend just 40% of their time with their mothers and are switched around between caretakers 8.3 times per hour, with about 14 people looking after the infant on average in 8 hours of observation. Also notable is the fact that children constitute only a quarter to a third of the population, and nearly half of women have either no or one child during their lifetime.\n\nThe Efé ideal is to marry by sister exchange, but this happens for only 40 percent of men. There is no bridewealth and very little bride service. The Efé are not allowed to marry anyone related to their grandfathers, and they trace their heritage patrilineally. Generally, residence is patrilocal and the composition of camps roughly follows that of a patriclan.\n\nThe Efé can be said to live in cooperation with the Lese, who live in villages of between fifteen and a hundred people and grow their food. The Efé make their camps on the outskirts of the forest near a Lese village for about seven months of the year (save for the best hunting season, January through March, and honey season), and are never more than eight hours away on foot from a village. The Efé generally trade the meat and honey they acquire in the forest for material goods or the cassava, bananas, peanuts, and rice grown by the Lese, and the meat provided by the Efé accounts for over half of the meat eaten by the Lese. Important goods that the Lese villagers provide for the Efé are tobacco and marijuana, which about half of men and a third of women smoke. In addition to trading meat and honey with the villagers, Efé men and women also provide their labour in exchange for foods, tobacco, marijuana, iron, cloth or other material goods. Women do this about 9.6% of their time, usually helping to plant, harvest, and prepare the food from Lese gardens in return for food from the garden. Efé men, on the other hand, mostly perform work related to clearing fields in December, and spend about 3.5% of their time doing it. They are usually paid with cooked food, some of which they eat right away and some of which they bring back to camp with them; but they are also occasionally paid with marijuana or tobacco. Men spend more time in the villages doing things other than working, like drinking palm wine with the villagers and generally socializing. Lese and Efé men even establish partnerships, which can be inherited and constitute a special bond between a Lese and an Efé man. However, these partnerships can be dissolved when an Efé man returns borrowed items to his Lese partner.\n\nOne aspect of the Lese–Efé relationship that is less than cooperative is the way in which they view each other. Efé often steal from Lese gardens, particularly around April and May when there is little food and the Lese are ungenerous about payment for Efé labor.\n\nThe Lese, on the other hand, view the Efé with something of a condescending attitude and see themselves as entirely separate entities. Efé are viewed by Lese men and women alike as being female. The Lese also see strict dichotomies between themselves and the Efé – they characterize the Efé as uneducated savages and see themselves as more civilized since they go to school and live in villages. Another interesting image they create is that of red versus white – the Efé and the meat and honey they provide are described as red, and the goods the Lese provide (dried corn, cassava, etc.) are closer to white in colour. However, Lese men describe Efé men as \"devoted friends and protectors\" and also find Efé women \"stronger, more sexually attractive, and more fertile than Lese women\". The Lese also believe that the Efé can hunt witches and protect the village from them.\n\nIt is rather difficult to accurately describe the Efé religion, as there is not a great deal of information that deals specifically with the Efé. The main source used was a collection of Bambuti legends, i.e. legends that the author felt belonged to some extent to all of the pygmy groups of the Ituri forest, but the tribe from whom the legends were gathered were one of the net-hunting groups, not the Efé. Because of the lack of information, it seems imprudent to relay any of the specific legends. The legends, though, tend to fall into three categories: “creation myths; legends of origin and tradition, legends dealing with social relations, and legends dealing with relations with the supernatural\".\n\nAnother interesting aspect of Efé religion is that it is also shared with the Lese. Many of pygmy legends deal with their larger partners, and the associated tribes have myths dealing with the pygmies. Even some religious ceremonies are held in common, such as the \"ima\" celebration in which girls who have reached menarche and been secluded in a hut together are carried back out into the village. Bailey describes the period of seclusion as being three months, but Grinker states that it is more like six months to a year and that the girls’ feet are not allowed to touch the ground without being wrapped in palm leaves and that whenever they have to use the bathroom, they must be carried to an outhouse wrapped in palm leaves so that the sun does not touch them. This period is also supposed to make the girls fat, and they are supposed to consume a lot of palm oil and meat while they are being sequestered.\n\nThe Efé speak Lese without any dialectical distinction from the Lese themselves. They also have a relationship with other farming peoples in the region: the Mamvu and Mvuba (close relatives of Lese) and the Bantu Bira, Nyali, and Nande.\n\n"}

She is best known for winning the Miss USA title, as Miss Missouri USA. She previously held the title of Miss Missouri 2002 and competed in Miss America, where she won a preliminary award. She placed as first runner-up at the Miss Universe 2004 competition. She is one of three women to have been both Miss Missouri USA and Miss Missouri and the only Missourian to have been Miss USA. Her first runner-up finish at Miss Universe was the best placement in the 2000s and was the best United States placement between Brook Mahealani Lee's Miss Universe 1997 competition victory and Olivia Culpo's Miss Universe 2012 pageant win.\n\nIn 2002, Finnessey authored an award-winning children's book, \"The Furrtails\", on individuality and disabilities. In the mid-2000s, she was Chuck Woolery's co-host for the game show \"Lingo\" on the Game Show Network. Finessey has also hosted \"PlayMania\" as well as \"quiznation\" and has served as a sideline reporter for the CBS tournament blackjack series \"Ultimate Blackjack Tour\".\n\nFinnessey was born to Patrick and Linda Finnessey, and she grew up in Florissant, Missouri. She attended McCluer North High School public high school for two years where, according to an interview with \"ABILITY Magazine\", she was teased a lot for her appearance. Finnessey recounted that she \"had a mullet, tinted glasses, acne and braces.\" The teasing made it difficult for her to focus on her studies, so for her junior year she transferred to the private all-girls Incarnate Word Academy, where she graduated in 1996. She completed a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology from Lindenwood University in December 1999. Following graduation, she worked briefly as a full-time substitute teacher in Jackson, Missouri, before starting graduate school. She began working on her Masters in Counseling, also at Lindenwood, but postponed her studies after being crowned Miss USA in 2004.\n\nFinnessey first competed in the Miss Missouri USA 2000 pageant in 1999 where, as Miss Saint Louis County in her senior year of college, she finished first runner-up to Denette Roderick. She competed again in the following year (2000) and placed second runner-up behind first runner-up Melana Scantlin and winner Larissa Meek in the Miss Missouri USA 2001 event.\n\nIn 2000, Finnessey competed in the Miss Oktoberfest pageant and was 3rd runner-up. The pageant was won by Jenna Edwards, who had previously been 1999 Miss Teen All-American and would later hold the Miss Florida 2004 and Miss Florida USA 2007 titles. First runner-up was Jennifer Glover, the previous Miss United States International 1999 and the future Miss California 2002 and Miss California USA 2001.\n\nOn November 18, 2000, Finnessey won the Miss Jackson title in the Miss Missouri system and finished 2nd runner-up to Jennifer Hover in the June 3 – 9, 2001 Miss Missouri pageant held in Mexico, MO. Finnessey won the Miss St. Louis Metro local title in the Miss Missouri system and went on to win the 2002 Miss Missouri title, succeeding Hover. She won the contest despite having slammed her hand in a car door that weekend. During the contest, she performed an arrangement of \"Flight of the Bumblebee\" on the piano for her talent. During her on-stage interview as one of the five finalists, she was asked what she learned having three brothers and she answered to be quick in the bathroom.\n\nShe represented Missouri in the Miss America 2003 pageant, where she won an evening gown preliminary award but did not place. For the talent portion of the competition in the Miss America system events (which the Miss USA system does not use) at times she played the violin and at other times the piano. In the competition to be Miss America, she played the piano.\n\nLess than a year after giving up her Miss Missouri title, as Miss Metro St. Louis (USA), Finnessey won the Miss Missouri USA pageant on her third attempt at Black River Coliseum in Poplar Bluff, Missouri. During her six-month reign as Miss Missouri USA, Finnessey was involved in such charities as the Variety Club Telethon, St. Louis Cardinals Winter Warm Up for local charities, AIDS Foundation, Special Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri and Gilda's Club. She joined Barbara Webster (Miss Missouri 1983 and Miss Missouri USA 1986) and Robin Elizabeth Riley (Miss Missouri 1987 and Miss Missouri USA 1983) as qualifiers to both of the nationally televised beauty pageants.\n\nShe represented Missouri in the April 12, 2004, nationally televised Miss USA 2004 pageant at the Kodak Theater in Los Angeles in front of hosts Nancy O'Dell and Billy Bush and judges Jeff Gordon, Jerry Buss, John Salley, Mekhi Phifer, Rocco DiSpirito and Jill Stuart. Her final question was whether experience or education serves a person better in life to which she answered \"Definitely experience because you get your knowledge through experience.\" She competed on the platform of integrating people with mental challenges into society. In the nationally televised pageant, she became the first woman from Missouri to win the Miss USA title. During her reign as Miss USA, Finnessey became an advocate for breast cancer and ovarian cancer awareness and research. She has also worked with Special Olympics, the National Down Syndrome Convention, American Cancer Society and Derek Jeter's Turn 2 Foundation (which helps at-risk kids choose healthier lifestyles). Finnessey resided in a luxury Riverside Drive apartment in New York City provided by the Miss Universe Organization and pageant co-owner Donald Trump.\n\nAs Miss USA, Finnessey went on to represent the United States at the international Miss Universe competition held in Quito, Ecuador, in May 2004, culminating on June 1, 2004. She placed first runner-up in the internationally broadcast competition, behind winner Jennifer Hawkins of Australia. The event was hosted by Bush and Daisy Fuentes and the judges included Petra Nemcova, Emilio Estefan and Bo Derek.\n\nAs Miss USA, Finnessey represented the Miss Universe Organization. Her Miss Universe Organization \"sister\" 2004 titleholders were Jennifer Hawkins (Miss Universe, of Australia) and Shelley Hennig (Miss Teen USA, of Louisiana).

That year when Miss California USA 2009 Carrie Prejean caused a notable controversy during her on-stage finalist interview with a response that she was opposed to same-sex marriage, Finnessey participated in a Miss California USA organization public service announcement promoting diversity along with several other Miss Universe Organization beauty pageant titlists.\n\nAfter completing her reign as Miss USA, Finnessey became a co-host of \"Lingo\" and \"PlayMania\" on GSN. She hosted Lingo from August 2005 at the start of the show's fourth season until the show went on hiatus in 2008. In April 2006, she began her turn with the interactive series \"PlayMania\", which broke into two shows on February 23, 2007. Finnessey became the co-host of the \"quiznation\" spinoff, a revised but similar version of the original \"PlayMania\". She remained a co-host until October 21, 2007, several days before the show's finale. She also was a sideline reporter for the CBS tournament blackjack series \"Ultimate Blackjack Tour\".\n\nShe also has appeared in several documentaries produced by GSN.

On September 2, 2008, Finnessey was on the season finale of \"Wanna Bet?\" on ABC, where she made a record for the biggest successful bet on the show betting $20,000 in the 1st best. Finnessey lost in the end betting $40,000 and guessing incorrectly. In August, 2010, she appeared on a special \"Girls of Summer\" week airing of NBC's \"Minute to Win It\" on an episode called \"Last Beauty Standing.\" The episode featured 10 beauty pageant winners competing for $100,000 towards their chosen charities along with a chance to win a $1,000,000 challenge. At the Miss USA 2011 competition, she was among the 31 former winners who were part of a photoshoot layout for \"Time Magazine\". She played the role of Stephie in the Roger Corman-produced Sharktopus (2010) which aired on the Syfy Channel three years before the same network made waves with its Sharknado movie franchise.\n\nIn January 2012, she became one of the original reporters for ENTV News (a branch of TVLine) on a premium YouTube Channel. In March 2013, she was selected as one of 36 bachelorettes to compete on the reality television show \"Ready For Love\". Finnessey was the winner for bachelor Ernesto Arguello, but the relationship ended briefly after the show.\n\nOn August 8, 2013, she was named as one of five correspondents for the entertainment magazine, OK!TV, that was scheduled to debut on September 9.\n\nHer parents are Patrick and Linda Finnessey.

She also practices yoga, meditation and performs knitting and abstract painting. In 2003, she dated August Busch IV and has also dated Italo Zanzi. She is a Republican, and during her Miss USA reign, she attended the Commander-in-Chief's Ball at the Second inauguration of George W. Bush.\n\nHer Miss USA press release also notes that she began her professional modelling career at the age of 6. She modeled with Ford Models in Chicago and Talent Plus in St. Louis. According to the Miss USA website at the time of her reign, her modelling experience included television commercials, runway modelling, newspaper and magazine ads as well as upscale fashion store experience. She claims to have once wrestled a greased pig. , her parents still lived in the house that she grew up in Florissant.\n\nIn 2013, Finnessey became a contestant on \"Ready for Love\" where she competed for the attention of Ernesto Arguello. She won Arguello's heart on the show, but the relationship was short-lived in real life. Later that year, she posed nude for a PETA anti-fur campaign opposing the distribution of fur coats as prizes during beauty pageants. On September 24, 2014, Finnessey announced on Twitter that she became engaged to businessman Ben Higgins. They were married on July 11, 2015, according to another autobiographical tweet. The couple has three sons; Finn Arthur (born June 10, 2016), Bodhi James (born May 1, 2018) and Charlie Bear (born May 5, 2020).\n\nFinnessey authored an award-winning children's book. Her book, which was published on August 1, 2002, was entitled \"Furrtails\" and helps the effort to integrate intellectually disabled children into regular classrooms and helps children appreciate individuality and understand their peers who have disabilities. She was recognized with an Authors Who Make a Difference award, known as AWMAD, (from Infinity Publishing) and a Ryan Brems Award for this work. She authored a second book entitled \"Suzanna the Banana\".\n\nOfficial\n\nArticles\n\nInterviews\n\nOther\n"}

When he was eight years old he performed his first piano audition in the Portuguese National Conservatory.\n\nIn 1963, aged 13, Palma finished second in a musical contest in Majorca, Spain. At the same time, he continued his studies, first at the Camões high school and next at a school in Abrantes. The next year, 1964, marked a turning point in Palma's musical style, after leaving his classical influences he started to play rock'n'roll and taught himself to play guitar.\n\nIn 1969, he joined the Hard rock band Sindikato while continuing his studies in the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Lisbon. Being in the band gave him the opportunity to play in the very first edition of the Vilar de Mouros Festival, in 1971. In that same year, aided by some friends, such as Rão Kyao, João Maló, Rui Cardoso and Vítor Mamede, he began to write lyrics and compose songs and in the end he recorded, with Sindikato, an album with a single and an album of covers.\n\nTo avoid conscription and the Portuguese Colonial War in Portugal's overseas territories in Africa, Jorge Palma dropped out of university and went to Denmark with his wife, Gisela Brande, where he lived from 1973 to 1974 as a political refugee. In Denmark, he got a job at a hotel and presented some of his musical works through radio broadcast. After the Carnation Revolution on April 25, 1974 in Lisbon, Jorge Palma returned home.\n\nJorge Palma's solo career started with the release of the single \"The Nine Billion Names of God\", based on the short story of the same name by Arthur C. Clarke with lyrics in English language. After that he spent some time improving his writing skills in Portuguese language with the famous poet and song lyricist José Carlos Ary dos Santos. His first LP, named Com Uma Viagem na Palma da Mão was released in 1975, in a style very influenced by Progressive Rock acts such as Yes, Genesis and Gentle Giant.\n\nIn 1977, he released his second album, Té Já, album that made him play abroad, in Spain and Brazil. Palma spent the following years, 1978 and 1979, in France, mainly in Paris, where he performed in several bars, playing songs of some major names of the musical panorama, such as Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Paul Simon, Crosby, Stills & Nash and others. After returning to Portugal, in 1979, Palma recorded and released his 3rd album, named Qualquer Coisa Pá Música, followed by live concerts alone or with the group O Bando.\n\nIn the early 1980s, he travelled to Paris, only returning in 1982 to finish the record of his 4th album, Acto Contínuo, album that was first meant to be a live album, but due to some difficulties, was recorded in studio. In 1983, when Palma was about to restart his musical studies, which he would finish in 1986, his first son, Vicente Palma, was born. In the next year, Palma recorded his 5th album, Asas e Penas, where he included a song dedicated to Vicente, named Castor (Beaver). In that same year he performed in Portugal, France and Italy, sometimes playing in the streets.\n\nIn 1985, Palma released one of the most acclaimed albums of his career, named O Lado Errado da Noite, the album included the single Deixa-me Rir, which became a huge success. The album received several musical awards and many music critics called it \"the right side of Jorge Palma\" (the album name is translated from Portuguese as \"the wrong side of the night\"). After releasing the album, Palma made a major Tournee, Azores and Madeira. In 1986 Palma finished his piano course and recorded the seventh album, Quarto Minguante, which was marked by the recording company's will of changing Palma's musical style, a thing he refused.\n\nAfter releasing his eighth album, Bairro do Amor, in 1989, Palma started a long period without releasing an album of originals, but continued his piano studies, finishing the Superior Course of Piano in the Portuguese National Conservatory in the next year. This last album was considered by many critics and newspapers among the best Portuguese albums of the century. The album was recorded by PolyGram, unlike the previous, as Palma had finished his contract with EMI after the refusal of the last in releasing the album. In 1991 was released a compilation titled Só, which revisited old songs with only vocals and Piano.\n\nAfter the release of this album, Palma formed the Palma's Gang, with members of the bands Xutos & Pontapés and Rádio Macau, which released a live album in 1993, titled Palma's Gang – Ao Vivo no Johnny Guitar. In that same year, Palma participated in an album of the punk band Censurados. The next two years, Palma performed in several stages from north to south Portugal, alone or with Palma's Gang, some of them broadcast by the RTP – Rádio e Televisão de Portugal. Meanwhile, his second son, Francisco Palma, was born.\n\nIn 1996, Palma accepted an invitation to join a new project, named Rio Grande, a band that included other famous Portuguese musicians, Tim (Xutos & Pontapés), João Gil (Ala dos Namorados), Rui Veloso and Vitorino.\n\nThe first album of the band was inspired in the Portuguese traditional music and became a major success in that year. In 1997, along with several concerts, Palma participated in several musical projects, such as Todo Este Céu with Né Ladeiras or Voz e guitarras, an acoustic album with several other artists. Also in 1997, the Rio Grande released their second album, a live album recorded in a major concert in Lisbon. In this album was present an unreleased song by Palma, Quem És Tu De Novo\n\nIn 1998, Palma played several major concerts, for university students in Lisbon and Porto, and also in the World's Fair Expo '98 in Lisbon.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1872314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872314", "title": "Tomorrow Never Knows", "text": "Tomorrow Never Knows\n\n\"Tomorrow Never Knows\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, written primarily by John Lennon and credited to Lennon–McCartney. It was released in August 1966 as the final track on their album \"Revolver\", although it was the first song recorded for the LP. The song marked a radical departure for the Beatles, as the band fully embraced the potential of the recording studio without consideration for reproducing the results in concert.\n\nWhen writing the song, Lennon drew inspiration from his experiences with the hallucinogenic drug LSD and from the book \"The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead\" by Timothy Leary, Richard Alpert and Ralph Metzner. The Beatles' recording employed musical elements foreign to pop music, including musique concrète, avant-garde composition and electro-acoustic sound manipulation. It features an Indian-inspired modal backing of tambura and sitar drone and bass guitar, with minimal harmonic deviation from a single chord, underpinned by a constant but non-standard drum pattern; added to this, tape loops prepared by the band were overdubbed \"live\" onto the rhythm track. Part of Lennon's vocal was fed through a Leslie speaker cabinet, normally used for a Hammond organ. The song's backwards guitar parts and effects marked the first use of reversed sounds in a pop recording, although the Beatles' 1966 B-side \"Rain\", which they recorded soon afterwards using the same technique, was issued over three months before \"Revolver\".\n\n\"Tomorrow Never Knows\" was an early and highly influential recording in the psychedelic and electronic music genres, particularly for its pioneering use of sampling, tape manipulation and other production techniques. It also introduced lyrical themes that espoused mind expansion, anti-materialism and Eastern spirituality into popular music. On release, the song was the source of confusion and ridicule for many fans and journalists; it has since received praise as an effective representation of a psychedelic experience. \"Pitchfork\" placed the track at number 19 on its list of \"The 200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s\", and \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it at number 18 on the magazine's list of the 100 greatest Beatles songs.\n\nJohn Lennon wrote \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" in January 1966, with lyrics adapted from the book \"The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead\" by Timothy Leary, Richard Alpert and Ralph Metzner, which was in turn adapted from the \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\". Although Beatles aide Peter Brown believed that Lennon's source for the lyrics was the \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\" itself, which, he said, Lennon had read while under the influence of LSD, George Harrison later stated that the idea for the lyrics came from Leary, Alpert and Metzner's book. Paul McCartney confirmed this, stating that when he and Lennon visited the newly opened Indica bookshop, Lennon had been looking for a copy of \"The Portable Nietzsche\" and found a copy of \"The Psychedelic Experience\" that contained the lines: \"Whenever in doubt, turn off your mind, relax, float downstream.\"\n\nLennon said he bought the book, went home, took LSD, and followed the instructions exactly as stated in the text. The book held that the \"ego death\" experienced under the influence of LSD and other psychedelic drugs is essentially similar to the dying process and requires similar guidance. This is a state of being known by eastern mystics and masters as \"samādhi\" (a state of being totally aware of the present moment; a one-pointedness of mind). \nHarrison questioned whether Lennon fully understood the meaning of the song's lyrics:\n\nBasically [the song] is saying what meditation is all about. The goal of meditation is to go beyond (that is, transcend) waking, sleeping and dreaming. So the song starts out by saying, \"Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream, it is not dying.\"\n\nThen it says, \"Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void – it is shining. That you may see the meaning of within – it is being.\" From birth to death all we ever do is think: we have one thought, we have another thought, another thought, another thought. Even when you are asleep you are having dreams, so there is never a time from birth to death when the mind isn't always active with thoughts. But you can turn off your mind, and go to the part which Maharishi described as: \"Where was your last thought before you thought it?\"\n\nThe whole point is that we are the song. The self is coming from a state of pure awareness, from the state of being. All the rest that comes about in the outward manifestation of the physical world (including all the fluctuations which end up as thoughts and actions) is just clutter. The true nature of each soul is pure consciousness. So the song is really about transcending and about the quality of the transcendent.\n\nI am not too sure if John actually fully understood what he was saying. He knew he was onto something when he saw those words and turned them into a song. But to have experienced what the lyrics in that song are actually about? I don't know if he fully understood it.\nThe title never appears in the song's lyrics. Lennon later revealed that, like \"A Hard Day's Night\", it was taken from one of Ringo Starr's malapropisms. In a television interview in early 1964, Starr had uttered the phrase \"Tomorrow never knows\" when laughing off an incident that took place at the British Embassy in Washington, DC, during which one of the guests had cut off a portion of his hair. The piece was originally titled \"Mark I\" and was referred to as such in the EMI studio documentation until the Beatles were remixing tracks for the \"Revolver\" album in June. \"The Void\" is cited as another working title, but according to Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn, this resulted from Neil Aspinall, the band's road manager and assistant, referring to it as such in a contemporary issue of \"The Beatles Book\". Lennon said he settled on Starr's phrase \"to sort of take the edge off the heavy philosophical lyrics\". He also said \"The Void\" would have been a more suitable title, but he was concerned about its obvious drug connotations. According to Aspinall's account in \"The Beatles Monthly\", the musical portion of the song was the result of all four Beatles working to ensure the music matched the power of Lennon's lyrics: \"The basic tune was written during the first hours of the recording session.\"\n\nMcCartney remembered that even though the song's harmony was mainly restricted to the chord of C, George Martin, the Beatles' producer, accepted it as it was and said it was \"rather interesting\". The harmonic structure is derived from Indian music, a genre that Harrison had introduced to the Beatles' sound late in 1965 with his sitar part on \"Norwegian Wood\", and is based on a high volume C drone played on a tambura. The song's musical key is C Mixolydian. The chord over the drone is generally C major, but some changes to B major result from vocal modulations, as well as orchestral and guitar tape loops.\n\nAccording to author Peter Lavezzoli, the composition is the first pop song to eschew formal chord changes altogether. Despite this limitation, musicologist Dominic Pedler sees the Beatles' harmonic ingenuity displayed in the upper harmonies – \"Turn off your mind\", for example, is a run of unvarying E melody notes, before \"relax\" involves an E–G melody-note shift and \"float downstream\" an E–C–G descent. \"It is not dying\" involves a run of three G melody notes that rise on \"dying\" to a B, at the start of the verse's fifth bar, creating a VII/I (B/C) \"slash\" polychord. Due to Lennon's adherence to Leary's text, \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" was also the first song by the Beatles to depart from any form of rhyming scheme.\n\n\"Tomorrow Never Knows\" was the first song attempted during the sessions for \"Revolver\", which started at 8 pm on 6 April 1966, in Studio 3 at EMI Studios (subsequently Abbey Road Studios). Geoff Emerick, who was promoted to the role of the Beatles' recording engineer for \"Revolver\", recalled that the band \"encouraged us to break the rules\" and ensure that each instrument \"should sound unlike itself\". Lennon sought to capture the atmosphere of a Tibetan Buddhist ceremony; he told Martin that the song should sound like it was being chanted by a thousand Tibetan monks, with his vocal evoking the Dalai Lama singing from a mountaintop. The latter effect was achieved by using a Leslie speaker. When the concept was explained to Lennon, he enquired if the same effect could be achieved by hanging him upside down and spinning him around a microphone while he sang into it. Emerick made a connector to break into the electronic circuitry of the Leslie cabinet and then re-recorded the vocal as it came out of the revolving speaker.\nFurther to their approach when recording \"Rubber Soul\" late the previous year, the Beatles and Martin embraced the idea of the recording studio as an instrument on \"Revolver\", particularly \"Tomorrow Never Knows\". As Lennon hated doing a second take to double his vocals, Ken Townsend, the studio's technical manager, developed an alternative form of double-tracking called artificial double tracking (ADT) system, taking the signal from the sync head of one tape machine and delaying it slightly through a second tape machine. The two tape machines used were not driven by mains electricity, but from a separate generator which put out a particular frequency, the same for both, thereby keeping them locked together. By altering the speed and frequencies, he could create various effects, which the Beatles used throughout the recording of \"Revolver\". Lennon's vocal is double-tracked on the first three verses of the song: the effect of the Leslie cabinet can be heard after the (backwards) guitar solo.\n\nThe track includes the highly compressed drums that the Beatles favoured at the time, with reverse cymbals, reverse guitar, processed vocals, looped tape effects, and sitar and tambura drone. In the description of musicologist Russell Reising, the \"meditative state\" of a psychedelic experience is conveyed through the musical drone, enhancing the lyrical imagery, while the \"buzz\" of a drug-induced \"high\" is sonically reproduced in Harrison's tambura rhythm and Starr's heavily treated drum sound. Despite the implied chord changes in the verses and repeatedly at the end of the song, McCartney's bass maintains a constant ostinato in C. Reising writes of the drum part: \nStarr's accompaniment throughout the piece consists of a kind of stumbling march, providing a bit of temporal disruption ... [The] first accent of each bar falls on the measure's first beat and the second stress occurs in the second half of the measure's third quarter, double sixteenth notes in stuttering pre-emption of the normal rhythmic emphasis on the second backbeat – hardly a classic rock and roll gesture.\n\nThe use of ¼-inch audio tape loops resulted primarily from McCartney's admiration for Stockhausen's \"Gesang der Jünglinge\". By disabling the erase head of a tape recorder and then spooling a continuous loop of tape through the machine while recording, the tape would constantly overdub itself, creating a saturation effect, a technique also used in musique concrète. The tape could also be induced to go faster and slower. McCartney encouraged the other Beatles to use the same effects and create their own loops. After experimentation on their own, the various Beatles supplied a total of \"30 or so\" tape loops to Martin, who selected 16 for use on the song. Each loop was about six seconds long.\n\nThe overdubbing of the tape loops took place on 7 April. The loops were played on BTR3 tape machines located in various studios of the Abbey Road building and controlled by EMI technicians in Studio Three. Each machine was monitored by one technician, who had to hold a pencil within each loop to maintain tension. The four Beatles controlled the faders of the mixing console while Martin varied the stereo panning and Emerick watched the meters. Eight of the tapes were used at one time, changed halfway through the song. The tapes were made (like most of the other loops) by superimposition and acceleration. According to Martin, the finished mix of the tape loops could not be repeated because of the complex and random way in which they were laid over the music. Harrison similarly described the mix of loops as \"spontaneous\", given that each run-through might favour different sounds over another.\nFive tape loops are prominent in the finished version of the song. According to author Ian MacDonald, writing in the 1990s, these loops contain the following:\n\n\nAuthor Robert Rodriguez writes that the content of the five loops has continued to invite debate among commentators, however, and that the manipulation applied to each of the recordings has made them impossible to decipher with authority. Based on the most widely held views, he says that, aside from McCartney's laughter and the B major chord, the sounds were two loops of sitar passages, both reversed and sped up, and a loop of Mellotron string and brass voicings. In their book \"Recording the Beatles\", Kevin Ryan and Brian Kehew list two loops of sitar recordings yet, rather than Mellotron, list a mandolin or acoustic guitar, treated with tape echo. Rather than revert to standard practice by having a guitar solo in the middle of the song, the track includes what McCartney described as a \"tape solo\". This section nevertheless includes a lead guitar part played by Harrison and recorded with the tape running backwards, to complement the sounds.\n\nThe final overdubs were recorded on 22 April. According to Lewisohn, who had access to EMI's studios logs and notes, these overdubs comprised Harrison's sitar and Lennon's Leslie-treated vocal part.\n\nLennon later told Beatles biographer Hunter Davies: \"I should have tried to get near my original idea, the monks singing. I realise now that's what I wanted.\" The discarded take 1 was issued on the \"Anthology 2\" compilation in 1996.\n\nWhile highlighting \"Love You To\" as an example of the Beatles fully exploring Indian musical form during the \"Revolver\" sessions, music historian Simon Philo identifies \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" as the track that \"made few if any concessions to formula, and so confirmed that the Beatles had unequivocally moved on. 'Tomorrow Never Knows' was barely a song, let alone a pop song.\" Musicologist William Echard describes it as an example of a raga rock song \"rubb[ing] shoulders with the classical avant-garde\". After completing the recording, McCartney was eager to gauge the reaction of the band's contemporaries. On 2 May, he played the song to Bob Dylan at the latter's hotel suite in London; as the track started, Dylan said dismissively: \"Oh, I get it. You don't want to be cute anymore.\" According to Marianne Faithfull, who was also present, Dylan then walked out of the room. McCartney recalled that when the Beatles played the song to members of the Rolling Stones and the Who, they \"visibly sat up and were interested\", whereas Cilla Black \"just laughed\".\n\nAfter experimenting with the techniques on \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", the Beatles used reversed sounds and tape-speed variation extensively throughout the \"Revolver\" sessions. On \"Rain\", which was issued as the B-side of their \"Paperback Writer\" single in May 1966, part of Lennon's vocal track was reprised backwards over the coda, while Harrison planned and recorded his lead guitar parts for \"I'm Only Sleeping\" with the tape direction reversed, in order to achieve a dislocated effect.\n\nTony Hall, a music industry figure and journalist with a reputation for predicting trends, was also given a preview of the song, along with other tracks from early in the sessions. Writing in his column for \"Record Mirror\" in the issue dated 14 May, Hall especially highlighted \"The Void\" when describing the new songs as \"the most revolutionary ever made by a pop group\". Focusing on the otherworldly electronic effects, he wrote: \"Sound-wise, it's like an hypnotically horrific journey through the dark never-ending jungle of someone's mind ... And the effect is of shapes and sounds and colours looming over and above one and zooming in and out of a monotonous drone.\" Hall added that the track was \"as revolutionary as Ornette Coleman appeared to the jazz scene a decade ago\", before concluding: \"[The Beatles] are so far ahead. And I'm longing to hear your reaction when the album is eventually issued.\"<ref name=\"Hall/RM\"></ref>\n\n\"Tomorrow Never Knows\" was sequenced as the final track on \"Revolver\", which EMI's Parlophone label issued on 5 August 1966. According to author Mark Hertsgaard, as the first song recorded during the \"Revolver\" sessions, its sequencing ensures that the track serves as \"the summit to which the entire album ascends\". In his design for the LP cover, Klaus Voormann drew inspiration from the song, recognising the need for artwork that would capture the Beatles' new direction and the avant-garde aspect of the recording. Voormann later said that he found \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" \"frightening\", adding that it was \"so far away from the early Beatles stuff that even I myself thought, well, the normal kind of Beatles fan won't want to buy this record. But they did.\"<ref name=\"Stummer/Guardian\"></ref> In an interview in October 1966, Harrison described the song as \"easily the most amazing new thing we've ever come up with\", but acknowledged that it might represent \"a terrible mess of a sound\" to listeners who approached the track without \"open ears\". He added: \"It's like the Indian stuff. You mustn't listen to Eastern music with a Western ear.\"\n\nIn advance of the release, EMI had issued the songs to radio stations throughout July, in increments, to prepare the Beatles' audience for the new music. \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" was the last track to receive a public airing, a few days before the album was issued commercially. Reaction to \"Revolver\" was \"generally ecstatic\", according to MacDonald, with listeners marvelling at the album's \"aural invention\". To the Beatles' less progressive fans, however, the radical changes in the band's sound were the source of confusion. The editor of the Australian teen magazine \"Mirabelle\" wrote: \"Everyone, from Brisbane to Bootle, hates that daft song Lennon sang at the end of \"Revolver\".\" Recalling the release in his 1977 book \"The Beatles Forever\", Nicholas Schaffner commented that whereas the group's more traditional fans warmed to McCartney's new songs, \"some people thought Lennon was sprouting complete gibberish, and concluded that the poor lad had slid off the deep end.\"\n\nIn his review for the \"NME\", Allen Evans said, in response to the lyric's exhortation to \"relax and float downstream\": \"But how can you relax with the electronic, outer-space noises, often sounding like seagulls? … Only Ringo's rock-steady drumming is natural.\" Peter Jones of \"Record Mirror\" commented: \"You need some sort of aural microscope to get the message from this. But it's darned compelling listening.\" In the recently launched \"Crawdaddy!\", Paul Williams derided \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" and the album's single, \"Yellow Submarine\", saying of Lennon's song: \"A good artist doesn't publish first drafts.\" Edward Greenfield of \"The Guardian\" described the track as \"the most remarkable item on a compulsive new record\". He said the lyrics were a \"curious sort of poetry\" that conveyed the concept of \"pop-music as a substitute, both for jungle emotions and for the consolations of religion\", as teenagers followed in the long societal tradition of disengaging the mind and surrendering \"to the tribal leader, the priest, or now the pop-singer\". Greenfield concluded by saying, \"Thank goodness Lennon is being satirical: at least one hopes so.\"\n\nIn 2006, \"Pitchfork\" ranked \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" at number 19 on its list of \"The 200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s\" and \"Q\" magazine placed the track 75th on a list of \"The 100 Greatest Songs of All Time\". \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" appears at number 18 on \"Rolling Stone\"s list of the best Beatles songs and at number 4 on a similar list compiled by \"Mojo\" in 2006. In 2018, the music staff of \"Time Out London\" ranked it at number 2 on their list of the best Beatles songs. According to Acclaimed Music, it is the 144th most celebrated song in popular music history.\n\nIn 2006, Martin and his son, Giles Martin, remixed 80 minutes of Beatles music for the Las Vegas stage performance \"Love\", a joint venture between Cirque du Soleil and the Beatles' Apple Corps. On the \"Love\" album, the rhythm to \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" was mixed with the vocals and melody from \"Within You Without You\", creating a different version of the two songs.\n\nReviewing the album for \"PopMatters\", Zeth Lundy wrote: \"The 'Within You Without You'/'Tomorrow Never Knows' mash-up, perhaps the most thrilling and effective track on the entire disc, fuses two especially transcendental songs into one: ... a union of two ambiguous, open-ended declarations of spiritual pursuit.\" In their chapter on the Beatles' psychedelic period in \"The Cambridge Companion to the Beatles\", authors Russell Reising and Jim LeBlanc describe \"Within You Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows\" as \"the most musically and visually stunning segment\" of the Cirque du Soleil show. The \"Love\" remix is one of the main songs in \"\".\n\nNicholas Schaffner said that listeners who had been confused by the song's lyrics were most likely unfamiliar with hallucinogenic drugs and Timothy Leary's message, but that the transcendental quality became clear during the build-up to the 1967 Summer of Love. According to Colin Larkin, writing in the \"Encyclopedia of Popular Music\", \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" has been recognised as \"the most effective evocation of a LSD experience ever recorded\".\n\nIan MacDonald says that the song's message represented a revolutionary concept in mainstream society in 1966, and by introducing LSD and Leary's \"psychedelic revolution\" to Western youth, it is \"one of the most socially influential records The Beatles ever made\". He adds: \"'Tomorrow Never Knows' launched the till-then élite-preserved concept of mind-expansion into pop, simultaneously drawing attention to consciousness-enhancing drugs and the ancient religious philosophies of the Orient, utterly alien to Western thought in their anti-materialism, rapt passivity, and world-sceptical focus on visionary consciousness.\"\n\nAccording to Simon Philo, \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" was the most groundbreaking track on an album that announced the arrival of the \"underground London\" sound. Barry Miles also sees it as the experimental highpoint of \"Revolver\", which he recalls as an \"advertisement for the underground\" and a work that resounded on the level of experimental jazz among members of the movement, including those who soon founded the UFO Club.\n\nHernan Campbell of Sputnikmusic recognises \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" as \"the most important Psychedelic composition in the history of the genre\" and \"the epitome of everything that psychedelia stands for\". In the opinion of former \"Mojo\" editor Paul Trynka, the track benefited most from the Beatles' ability to channel their ideas into a recognisable song form, a discipline that ensured their psychedelic recordings were superior to those by the Grateful Dead and other contemporary San Francisco acts. In the 1997 \"Mojo\" feature article \"Psychedelia: The 100 Greatest Classics\", Jon Savage listed the April 1966 recording as the first item in his chronological history of UK psychedelia, adding that the track \"immediately impacted on pop culture\".\n\nWriting in his book \"Electronic and Experimental Music\", Thom Holmes includes \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" in his list of the \"pioneering works\" in electronic music. He says that the track \"ushered in a new era in the use of electronic music in rock and pop music\". In the book \"Encyclopedia of Classic Rock\", David Luhrssen and Michael Larson say that with \"Revolver\" the Beatles \"erased boundaries of time and culture\", adding: \"Ancient met modern on 'Tomorrow Never Knows' as sitars encountered tape loops. 'Tomorrow Never Knows' reintroduced the sustained repetition of the drone, absent in Western music since the Middle Ages and only recently discovered by avant-garde composer La Monte Young.\" According to Peter Lavezzoli, in his book \"The Dawn of Indian Music in the West\", \"'Tomorrow Never Knows' was the most groundbreaking production to date in popular music\" and he says it \"still retains a terrifying visceral power\".\n\nMusicologist Walter Everett describes \"Revolver\" as \"an innovative example of electronic music\" and says that \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" was also \"highly influential\" on psychedelic rock. He identifies its studio effects and musical form as central to Pink Floyd's \"Pow R. Toc H.\" and recognises the same use of extreme tape-speed manipulation in subsequent recordings by Jimi Hendrix and Frank Zappa, and backwards tapes in the work of Hendrix, Pink Floyd, the Byrds, the Who, the Electric Prunes, Spirit, Tomorrow, Soft Machine and the First Edition. He also identifies the Leslie-treated vocal as a precedent for similar experimentation by Hendrix, the Grateful Dead, the Moody Blues, Cream, Yes, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.\n\nJon Pareles, the chief pop music critic at \"The New York Times\", has described \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" as \"a portal to decades of music to come\". Author Steve Turner highlights the sound sampling and tape manipulation as having had \"a profound effect on everyone from Jimi Hendrix to Jay Z\". Having introduced these techniques to mainstream pop, Turner writes, \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" inspired the sampling that became commonplace over ten years later – such as in Sugarhill Gang's \"Rapper's Delight\" and other examples of an artist taking a well-known riff or musical motif from an existing song; in David Byrne and Brian Eno's \"My Life in the Bush of Ghosts\", with its use of assorted spoken-word and vocal samples; in recordings by Big Audio Dynamite, which included samples from film soundtracks; and in Moby's \"Play\", with its incorporation of little-known and disparate vocal tracks. In 2011, DJ Spooky said that the Beatles' song remained \"in the DNA of so much going on these days\" and that the use of \"tape collage alone makes it one of the first tracks to use sampling really successfully. I also think that Brian Eno's idea of the studio-as-instrument comes from this kind of recording.\n\nRecalling his introduction to \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" in 1966, American producer Tony Visconti has said: \"It was incredible how the music matched the lyrics and, previous to this album, nobody was writing like that.\" He also said that \"Revolver\" \"showed how the studio could be used as an instrument\" and contributed to his decision to relocate to London, because, \"I had to learn how people made records like this.\" In his 2004 book \"Sonic Alchemy: Visionary Music Producers and Their Maverick Recordings\", David Howard pairs Martin's work on \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" with Phil Spector's 1966 production of \"River Deep – Mountain High\" as the two \"visionary achievements in sound\" that ensured that \"the recording studio was now its own instrument: record production had been elevated into art.\"\n\nThe song is referenced in the lyric to Oasis' 1995 song \"Morning Glory\": \"Tomorrow never knows what it doesn't know too soon\". The Chemical Brothers have referred to \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" as the template for their music; their 1996 track \"Setting Sun\" is a direct tribute to it, as is \"Let Forever Be\". John Foxx of Ultravox also cited \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" as an influence, saying that \"As soon as I heard it, I knew it contained almost everything that I would want to investigate for the rest of my life.\"<ref name=\"Leigh/LoveMeDo\"></ref> In 2012, the song was included as the title track of the Beatles' iTunes compilation album \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", which the band's website described as a collection of \"the Beatles' most influential rock songs\".\n\n\nThe song was parodied, as \"L.S. Bumblebee\", as part of a satirical sketch on the Swinging London phenomenon in the \"Not Only ... But Also\" 1966 Christmas TV special, which included a cameo appearance by Lennon. Sung by comedians Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, both of whom are dressed in Indian clothing, the song evokes the seagull sounds of \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" through the presence of a bird squawking in the studio, and includes lyrics playing on the sensory contradictions of lines such as \"Listen to the colour of your dreams\" from the Beatles track.\n\nIn 1967, Bruce Conner used \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" as the soundtrack to his LSD-inspired experimental film \"Looking for Mushrooms\". When reworking the film for a 1996 presentation, Conner replaced the song with an instrumental piece by avant-garde composer Terry Riley.\n\n\"Tomorrow Never Knows\" was featured during the final scene of the 2012 \"Mad Men\" episode \"Lady Lazarus\". Don Draper's wife Megan gives him a copy of \"Revolver\", calling his attention to a specific track and suggesting, \"Start with this one\". Draper, an advertising executive, is struggling to understand youth culture, but after contemplating the song for a few puzzled moments, he shuts it off. The track also played over the closing credits. The rights to the song cost the producers around $250,000, \"about five times as much as the typical cost of licensing a song for TV\".\n\nAccording to Ian MacDonald:\n\n\n"}

He was the son of actor Carroll O'Connor.\n\nHugh was born in Rome, Italy. When he was six days old, he was adopted by Carroll and his wife, Nancy. Carroll was in Rome filming \"Cleopatra\". He was named after Carroll's brother, who died in a motorcycle accident in 1961.\n\nWhen he was 16, Hugh was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. He survived the cancer with chemotherapy and two surgeries but ultimately became addicted to drugs. He had been taking prescription drugs for the pain and marijuana for nausea but later became dependent on harder drugs. Despite numerous stays at rehabilitation clinics, he never conquered his addiction and remained in recovery.\n\nHugh married Angela Clayton, a wardrobe assistant on \"In the Heat of the Night,\" on March 28, 1992. Their son, Sean Carroll O'Connor, was born in 1993.\n\nSix months before Hugh's death, Angela told Carroll that a man named Harry Thomas Perzigian had been furnishing Hugh with drugs. Carroll had retained a private detective to investigate. About a week before Hugh's death Carroll brought the evidence to the Los Angeles Police, asking them to arrest Perzigian.\n\nSeveral hours after Hugh's death, Carroll publicly named Perzigian as the man who caused his death. Perzigian was arrested the next day for drug possession and furnishing cocaine after a search of his apartment turned up cocaine and drug paraphernalia. In January 1996, he was sentenced to a year in jail, a $1,000 fine, 200 hours of community service, and three years of probation.\n\nPerzigian later sued Carroll for slander for calling him a \"sleazeball\" and saying \"he was a partner in murder, not an accessory, a partner in murder\" in an interview with Diane Sawyer on ABC's \"Primetime Live\". After a highly publicized civil trial, Carroll was found not liable. He dedicated much of the rest of his life to speaking out on drug awareness.\n\nOn March 28, 1995, the third anniversary of his marriage, Hugh called his father Carroll to tell him he was going to end his life. He told his father he believed he could not beat his drug addiction and could not face another drug rehabilitation program. Carroll called the police, who arrived at Hugh's Pacific Palisades, California home just as he shot himself. The police later determined he had cocaine in his blood.\n\nHugh's body was cremated and his ashes were originally buried at the Church of St. Susanna in Rome, Italy. Later, they were moved to the mausoleum of the Pontifical North American College in Campo Verano, Rome, Italy. Today, he has a cenotaph at the Church of St. Susanna.\n\nAfter Hugh's death, Carroll successfully lobbied to get the state of California to pass legislation that allows family members of an addicted person or anyone injured by a drug dealer's actions, including employers, to sue for reimbursement for medical treatment and rehabilitation costs. The law, known as the \"Drug Dealer Liability Act\" in California, went into effect in 1997. It is an updated version of the Model Drug Dealer Liability Act authored in 1992 by then Hawaii U.S. Attorney Daniel Bent. It had been passed in several states before it was passed in California with Carroll's support, and is now the law in sixteen states and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Successful cases have been brought under the Model Drug Dealer Liability Act in Michigan, Utah, and Illinois.\n\n\n"}

It tells the story of an undercover police officer's experiences in a Hasidic community. It was entered into the 1992 Cannes Film Festival. It is often cited as one of Lumet's two failures of the 1990s, the other being \"Guilty as Sin\" (1993). Despite the poor reviews suffered by both these films, Lumet received the 1993 D. W. Griffith Award of the Directors Guild of America. The film was also the first credited role for actor James Gandolfini. The shooting of this movie was used as an example in Lumet’s book \"Making Movies\".\n\nHardened New York City homicide detective Emily Eden (Melanie Griffith), daughter of a divorced former cop, and her partner Nick (Jamey Sheridan) attempt to arrest two drug dealers. However, Nick is stabbed by one of the dealers, whom Emily wounds instead of alerting assistance at first. As a result, her superior Lt. Oliver (David Margulies) temporarily takes away her gun. After Nick is hospitalized, eventually heading to recovery, while the dealers have been apprehended, Emily goes undercover to investigate the murder of a Hasidic diamond-cutter named Yaakov Klausman (Jake Weber). She questions the family of the Hasidic rebbe (Lee Richardson), an elderly Holocaust survivor who is revered for his wisdom and compassion toward his fellow Jews. He says to her, \"You and I have something in common: We are both intimately familiar with evil. It does something to your soul.\"\n\nWhile living with the rebbe's family, Emily changes her appearance and takes a liking to his son, Ariel (Eric Thal), a young man who works as a diamond-cutter but teaches in the yeshiva and is expected to follow his father as the next rebbe. In addition to keeping all 613 Mitzvot, he is waiting for his intended, or basherte, the daughter of a Paris rebbe whom he has not yet actually met. They are the subjects of an arranged marriage, but he believes that she is his soul mate, chosen by God. He is also studying the Kabbalah, which is regarded as rather daring for a man under 40. Its discussion of sexual intimacy is restrained but specific, as well as a metaphor for the relationship between Man and God.\n\nEmily finds out that the \"inside man\" in the murder plot is the rebbe's adopted daughter Mara (Tracy Pollan), who had been living a disorderly life until Yaakov introduced her to the rebbe. Afterwards, she joined the community as a repentant \"baalat tshuva,\" \"one who has returned,\" until a person from her past approached her and she let him into the Diamond Center to steal diamonds worth about $750,000 and kill Yaakov.\n\nShortly after, Emily saves the rebbe's daughter Leah (Mia Sara) from being scammed by the Baldessari brothers Anthony (James Gandolfini) and Christopher (Chris Latta), who claim to be Yaakov's killers. Emily instructs her second partner Levine (John Pankow) to alert assistance and arrests the Baldessaris, but the Baldessaris manage to escape. In the ensuing chase, Levine is injured, while Emily fatally shoots the Baldessaris. Before succumbing to his wounds, Anthony admits to Emily that he and Christopher were not responsible for Yaakov's death.\n\nHaving solved the case such as Mara now an accessory to murder, Emily rejects Nick's proposal, secretly romances Ariel to overcome her personal problems, and returns to the rebbe's home with him, but finds that Mara has taken Leah hostage. After Emily attempts to negotiate, Mara knocks her out, and Ariel kills Mara with Emily's revolver, avenging Yaakov. Ariel comments that sometimes an evil deed has a partially good result. Emily is hospitalized for an examination, while the rebbe and his family bid her farewell. Ariel and his basherte Shayna Singer (Rena Sofer) get married, in which a reformed Emily watches from a distance. Eventually, she returns to work and catches up with an also reformed Levine, who is on leave and invites her on a two-week trip to Aruba. However, she declines and awaits her bashert.\n\n\n\"A Stranger Among Us\" received negative reviews from critics. It currently holds a 23% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 40 reviews. Some of the criticism of \"A Stranger Among Us\" is based on comparisons with the Academy Award-winning film \"Witness\", which has a superficially similar plot. Similarly, Lumet's earlier film \"Fail-Safe\" was unfavorably compared to \"Dr. Strangelove\", but in that case both films have subsequently achieved cult status. Griffith's performance in the lead role has also been heavily criticized, for which her role won her the Razzie Award for Worst Actress (also for the year's Worst Picture, \"Shining Through\"), while Tracy Pollan was nominated for Worst Supporting Actress.\n\nSome aspects of the plot recall the 1977 murder of diamond dealer Pinchos Jaroslawicz.\n\nThe filming of the shootout took place at the Eldridge Street Synagogue on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.\n\n"}

This verse contains one of the very first mentions of Jesus (after ). Joseph is being spoken to in a dream by an angel. In this verse the angel comes to him and tells him of the nature of his child.\n\nThe original Koine Greek, according to Westcott and Hort, reads:\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 1:21\n\nThis verse is the first clear indication of how the author of Matthew sees Jesus. France notes that in the Old Testament only God had the power to absolve sins thus this verse shows that Jesus will be far greater than any of the prophets and other holy men.\n\nThe traditional view is that this verse clearly shows that the role of the messiah would not be one of national liberator, as most Jews had expected, but rather a spiritual liberator. Generally the word translated as \"people\" was used to refer to the Jewish people, but \"his people\" could also refer to all of humanity. Carter disagrees with this opinion. He believes that the author of Matthew originally intended this saving to be political. To Carter the sins of bondage, Roman domination, and economic control were just as important as religious and moral sins. He argues that the rest of the infancy narrative is deeply political with its focus on the Kings of Judah and the deeply sinful King Herod. The verse was reinterpreted when the Second Coming failed to occur and liberate Israel from the empire.\n\nGundry sees this verse as important evidence of how the author of Matthew viewed sin and salvation. Gundry reports that there are two distinct views of sin in the New Testament. Romans 7 presents sin as a malicious external power that induces people to do evil. Matthew differs from this view. The gospel pluralizes the word \"sin\" implying that sin is not a universal force. Moreover, referring to \"their sins\" presents sin as the fault of the sinner not of an external force. Gundry argues that by the Romans definition deliverance is saving people from the influence of sin, but in Matthew deliverance is rescuing people from the punishment that will inevitably be meted out for sinning.\n"}

She released three albums with Dave Carter during her lifetime, at first doing instrumental work and providing backing vocals, and then, by their last album together, singing lead vocals on half of the tracks. Four albums by the duo have been released since Carter's death. She has also released four solo recordings, some of which have included previously unreleased songs by Carter, as well as two songbooks.\n\nBorn in Homestead, Florida, Tracy Grammer was raised in Southern California and began her musical career on a borrowed violin at the age of 9. She came from a musical family. Her father, Jim Grammer, played acoustic, electric, and lap steel guitars. Distant relation Leo Fortin played violin and was best known for playing double-trumpets in Lawrence Welk's orchestra. She earned a Bachelor's degree in English literature from the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nFollowing Dave Carter's death in 2002, Grammer made the decision to play solo at several of the dates that they had scheduled, most notably an engagement at the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival. Taking into account Carter's expressed wish that eventually she would sing all of the songs, she continued playing Carter's music. She has continued to tour solo and has released four solo albums. The first, \"The Verdant Mile\", is an EP containing her first original composition, the title track, a eulogy for Carter.\n\nHer second solo release, \"Flower of Avalon\", consists of ten tracks, nine of which were written by Carter before her death, and one of which is a traditional folk song arranged by William Jolliff. The album was co-produced by Grammer and John Jennings. Featured artists include Mary Chapin Carpenter, who provided many backing vocals, and Jim Henry, Grammer's touring partner and Signature Sounds label mate.\n\nHer third album, \"Book of Sparrows\", was released in November, 2007 and is a seven-song EP featuring covers of songs by Tom Russell, Kate Power, David Francey, Dave Carter, and Paul Simon. The EP was co-produced by Grammer and Jim Henry.\n\nIn 2005, her company, Tracy Grammer Music, made arrangements with Elise Fischer, Carter's sister and copyright owner, to administer the catalog of Dave Carter, giving her effective control over the duo's music.\n\nIn addition to touring, Grammer was choral conductor at the Academy at Charlemont from 2010 until 2012. She released an album on Red House Records in February 2012, \"Little Blue Egg\", which contained 11 previously-unheard duo recordings that had been recovered from the Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer archives. Later that year, she and Red House released \"Joy My Love\", a limited-edition EP containing five more of the duo's archived recordings.\n\nIn January 2014, Tracy Grammer joined 21 other female singer-songwriters in a project headed by Cary Cooper called \"RealWomenRealSongs.\" The project required each participant to write and upload one song per week for 52 weeks to the RealWomenRealSongs YouTube channel. Several of the songs written during that project appear on Grammer's fourth solo recording and first songwriter release, \"Low Tide\" (Tracy Grammer Music, 2018). \"Low Tide\" was funded entirely by a Kickstarter campaign that reached its goal in just 34 hours and engaged more than 700 fans.\n\nIn 2016, Grammer debuted a new presentation called \"words+music\" that weaves readings from her memoir-in-progress with songs and musical excerpts on violin and guitar. words+music is an occasional show focusing on Grammer's life with Dave Carter, including the effect of Carter's gender transition on the duo's life and work together, and Grammer's path to back to the stage after Carter's death.\n\n"}

One deals with Vanya's close friend and former love object, Natasha, who has left her family to live with her new lover, Alyosha. Alyosha is the saintly but dimwitted son of Prince Valkovsky, who hopes to gain financially by marrying Alyosha off to an heiress, Katya. Valkovsky's cruel machinations to break up Alyosha and Natasha make him one of the most memorable \"predatory types\" (like Stavrogin in \"The Possessed\") that Dostoevsky created. The other plotline focuses on a thirteen-year-old orphan, Nellie, whom Vanya saves from an abusive household by taking her into his apartment, and whose deceased mother's story in some ways parallels that of Natasha. It's unusual to see a well-developed character as young as Nellie in a Dostoevsky novel, but Nellie may be one of his most moving creations, and she in particular shows the influence of Dickens (Dostoevsky is known to have read Dickens during the Siberian exile; this novel was conceived near the end of this exile. In turn Japanese director Akira Kurosawa adapted Nellie's story in his 1965 film, \"Red Beard\").\n\nOne of the most important themes throughout Dostoevsky's work is the expiative value of suffering, and The Insulted and Injured, with its tragically moving plot and characters, develops that theme.\n\nNatasha leaves her parents' home and runs away with Alyosha (prince Alexey) – the son of Prince Valkovsky. As a result of his pain, her father, Nikolai, curses her. The only friend that remains by Natasha's side is Ivan – her childhood friend who is deeply in love with her, and whom Natasha has rejected despite their being engaged.\nPrince Valkovsky tries to destroy Alyosha's plans to marry Natasha, and wants to make him marry the rich princess Katerina. Alyosha is a naïve but loveable young man who is easily manipulated by his father. Following his father's plan, Alyosha falls in love with Katerina, but still loves Natasha. He is constantly torn between these two women, too indecisive and infatuated with both to make a decision. Eventually, Natasha sacrifices her own feelings and withdraws in order for Alyosha to choose Katerina.\nMeanwhile, Ivan rescues an orphan girl, Elena (known as Nellie), from the clutches of a procuress and learns that her mother ran away from her father's (Jeremy Smith's) home with her sweetheart, a man who abandoned her when Nellie's mother gave birth. It is later revealed that Prince Valkovsky is Nellie's father. Her parents were legally married, but Prince Valkovsky persuaded his young and innocent wife to rob her father, Jeremy. After moving to Petersburg, Nellie's mother asks forgiveness to her father, but he rejects them. Before dying, Nellie's mother makes Nellie promise to never go to her real father, whose name is on a document she leaves her daughter. \nIn attempt to make Nikolai (Natasha's father) reconcile with Natasha, Ivan persuades Nikolai and his wife to adopt Nellie. By telling them her life story, Nellie makes Nikolai's heart soften and he forgives Natasha and removes his curse, and they are reunited. Natasha's family plans to move from Petersburg, but just before they leave Nellie dies from a chronic heart condition; the little girl makes it clear to Ivan she does not forgive her father for his cruel treatment of her mother. She also tells him he should marry Natasha. The story ends on an ambiguous note with Natasha and Ivan reflecting on the events that have unfolded.\n\n\nIn 1922 a German silent film directed by Frederic Zelnik was based on the novel.\n\n\"Humiliated and Insulted\" was adapted in 1991 for cinema by Soviet director Andrei Andreyevich Eshpai with Nastassja Kinski as Natasha.\n\nThe Hong Kong film \"The Insulted and the Injured\" (豪門孽債), released in 1950, was based on the story, but set in post-WWII Shanghai. It was directed by Lau King, who also plays the character of the young writer Cen Mu in the film.\n\n"}

After it discharges into the Saale at Nienburg. The river is named after a legendary giant, the wild, rampaging, Bohemian, \"Prince Bodo\", who, according to the \"Rosstrappe\" legend changed into a marauding dog that guarded the crown of \"Princess Brunhilde\" in the \"Kronensumpf\" (\"crown marsh\") in the present-day Bode Gorge (). The gorge is the narrow section of the Bode valley between Treseburg and Thale.\n\nAccording to tradition, there was once a giant called \"Bodo\" who came from Thuringia to pursue \"Brunhilde\", the king's beautiful daughter, whom he wanted to marry against her will. \"Brunhilde\" fled on a white stallion (\"Ross\"), but they suddenly came to a deep ravine. With one bold leap she reached the rocks on the far side, but her pursuer fell into the abyss. The hoofprint of her horse can still be seen today as the so-called \"Rosstrappe\". Meanwhile, \"Bodo\" was turned into a dog. As her horse leapt the gorge, however, the princess lost her golden crown, which was now guarded by the dog \"Bodo\" in the valley of the river. The river was given the name \"Bode\" after the giant \"Bodo\" who was now under a spell.\n\nThe Bode is heavily divided in its source region on the Brocken, the highest peak in the Harz, but its two most important source streams are the: \n\nThe two rivers, which actually have a temperature difference of 2 °C, merge not far from the Königsburg Ruins immediately before flowing into the Königshütte Dam (a feeder dam or \"Überleitungssperre\").\n\nOther tributaries of the Bode include the Rappbode and the Luppbode. The Rappbode is impounded near Wendefurth by the Rappbode Dam. At the northern end of this reservoir, the Rappbode joins the Bode, which is impounded here by the Wendefurth Dam. Other tributaries of the Bode are the Goldbach, the Holtemme and the Selke.\n\nThe waterfalls in the Harz are not high. The Upper Bode Falls (\"Obere Bode-Fall\") on the Warme Bode are really a fast-flowing stream (\"Sturzbach\") with small steps about 1 metre in height. Likewise the Lower Bode Falls (\"Untere Bode-Fall\") on the Warme Bode is simply ledge of similar height.\nThe \"Bodekessel\" in the Bode Gorge is a former step in a large hollow, that was reduced in height in 1798 from 2 metres to 1 metre by explosive. The fourth waterfall is in the \"Kästental\".\n\nThe Bode winds its way between Treseburg and Thale through a long, narrow valley, the \"Bode Gorge\". Today, the valley is a nature reserve. The Bode Gorge and its villages are the primary setting for Theodor Fontane’s novel, \"Cécile\".\n\nThe river then crosses the Harz Foreland in a curving and, in places, diked and canalised, course until it discharges into the Saale at Nienburg. Important Bode tributaries are the Selke and the Holtemme.\nOther towns on the Bode river are Quedlinburg, Wegeleben, Gröningen, Oschersleben, Hadmersleben, Egeln and Staßfurt.\n\nThe Bode gorge north of Thale is now a protected area.\n\nIn a hydrological sense every source stream of the Bode has a specific catchment area in the Harz, that is part of the catchment area of the Bode. The catchment areas of the various reservoirs are as follows: for the Wendefurth Reservoir, , for the Rappbode Pre-Dam and Rappbode Reservoirs, , and for the Königshütte Reservoir, . The Mandelholz Dam impounds the water of the \"Kalte Bode\". The total catchment area of the Bode is about .\n\nIn the Early Middle Ages the Bode formed the border between the provinces of the \"Harzgau\" in the west and the \"Schwabengau\" in the east. The two most important Bode crossings at that time were the settlements of Ditfurt und Gröningen, mentioned frequently in the Fuldau annals.\n\nHeinrich Heine depicts the romantic Bode valley in his 1826 travelogue \"Die Harzreise\": \n\nThe 'most devastating' floods from the Bode occurred in the years 1539, 1667, 1730, 1740, 1772 and especially at Christmas in 1925. Only on the completion of the Rappbode Dam in 1959 could the risk of flooding be eliminated. The water quantities in the Bode can vary significantly: during the New Year flooding in 1925 a discharge of was recorded, whereas in the following summer of 1926 it fell to just .\n\n\n\n"}

On July 31, 1962, NORAD recommended a tracking radar at Clear to close the BMEWS gap with Thule for low-angle missiles vice those with the 15-65 degree angle for which BMEWS was designed (North Dakota's Cavalier AFS radar built in 1975 currently monitors for Hudson Bay launches.)\n\nDetachment 2 of the 71st Missile Warning Wing was responsible for operations by civilian contractor personnel until 1964, when Air Force personnel began permanently manning the Tactical Operations Room (TOR). (Clear was unable to perform its mission for 6 minutes due to the record 1964 earthquake.)\n\nIn 1966, the last of the 5 BMEWS tracking radars was installed an RCA AN/FPS-92 Radar Set with an diameter antenna housed in a diameter radome. The FPS-92 was an improved tbd AN/FPS-49 Radar Set variant with radome blocks having two high-density 1 millimeter thick skins that cover a 15 centimeter thick Kraft-paper core (total of 1,646 hexagonal and pentagonal blocks (the hexagonal blocks were \"66-inch panels\".) FPS-92 completion raised the \"final construction price\" of \"the missile warning system at Clear\" to $300 million ($62 million by the Alaska District of the Corps of Engineers, e.g., for excavation and poured concrete as during building of the $2.8 million construction camp.)\nClear provided emergency shelter for 216 flood refugees during August 1967, the same year many \"temporary\" buildings were replaced. Clear subsequently provided measurements for a University of Alaska experiment which injected sulfur hexafluoride into the upper atmosphere to see if the Aurora Borealis could be affected. Clear had Bomb Alarm System equipment installed by the time the BAS was accepted on 10 February 1961 (deactivated in 1970.) In 1975, SECDEF told Congress that Clear would be closed when the Shemya Island and Beale AFB radars became operational. After a Thule radome fire, Clear's FPS-92 radome was replaced in 1981 by first disassembling the tracker, constructing the new radome, and reconstructing the FPS-92. Clear's 1st all-female crew pulled its 1st shift on February 28, 1986 (the 1st female, Lt. Anderson was assigned in 1973.)\n\nBeginning in 1987, ITT operated and maintained the Clear BMEWS\nunder a USAF Space Command contract and in the 1990s, the Southwest Research Institute upgraded Clear's pulse modulator for the transmitter final-stage power amplifier.\n\nOn April 16, 1998, groundbreaking for installing 1987 AN/FPS-115 PAVE PAWS components from Texas (e.g., the array elements) was held at Clear for the more advanced Raytheon AN/FPS-120 with 2500 \"solid state transmitter\" modules. On December 15, 2000, the FPS-50 and −92 transmissions ceased (all of the Arecibo Observatory's Litton L-5773 klystrons were obtained as surplus from Clear's decommissioned BMEWS transmitters.) Clear's FPS-120 began 24-hour operations when Clear's SSPARS Site (separate from the BMEWS site) had Initial Operational Capability on January 31, 2001; the date the entire SSPARS became operational (SSPARS sites were modified in the Early Warning Radar Service Life Extension Program.)\n\nOn August 30, 2006, after a transition that began in 2001, the ANG's 213th Space Warning Squadron took on the early warning/space surveillance mission. BAE Systems began a 2007 contract for SSPARS maintenance, and the Clear FPS-120 was subsequently upgraded to an AN/FPS-132 Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR) by Boeing Integrated Defense Systems \"featuring processor and software improvements to enhance capability.\"\n"}

{"id": "1872396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872396", "title": "Rise of Nations: Rise of Legends", "text": "Rise of Nations: Rise of Legends\n\nRise of Nations: Rise of Legends is a real-time strategy video game for Microsoft Windows, made by Big Huge Games, and published by Microsoft. It is a spin-off of the popular \"Rise of Nations\", released in May 2003. However, rather than being a historical game, it is based in a fantasy world, where technology and magic co-exist. It was released on May 9, 2006 in North America and on various dates around May 26, 2006 in the rest of the world.\n\n\"Rise of Legends\" retains most of the features from \"Rise of Nations\", like city building, borders, attrition, assimilations, non-depletable resources and the Conquer The World (CTW) campaigns. However, \"Rise of Legends\" also introduces new features of its own, such as city districts, heroes, dominances, a more simplified economy (with only two resources) and neutral, siegeable units and buildings. The reality-based resource wood has been replaced by Timonium. Unlike its predecessor, which offered the player 18 civilizations to choose from, \"Rise of Legends\" has only three races. These are the technological Vinci, the magical Alin, and the alien-like Cuotl, who replace the Wealth resource with Energy, offering a new gather strategy. Each race is completely distinct from the others, allowing for different gameplay depending on the player's choice. It also makes use of the AGEIA PhysX physics engine.\n\n\"Rise of Legends\" has a number of unique features that set it apart from its predecessor.\n\nUnlike most RTS-type games, in which a player starts with a city center and expands from there, Rise of Legends gives the player a city center, but adds a second, distinct building class: Districts. There are five districts in the game; they vary between the three races, but mostly serve the same purpose of increasing the size of the city, as well as offering benefits that will be elaborated upon later. The other buildings include the standard unit factories and defensive structures, as well as unique buildings for each race. The following is a list of the five different districts:\n\nMaster Units are enormous units when compared to standard units, and are therefore extremely powerful. A player may only have one Master Unit at a time. Each unit has its own set of powerful abilities, and is equally effective against infantry, large units, or buildings. Master units can only be accessed after creating a Great City; they also require huge amounts of resources.\n\nThe Vinci control the Land Leviathan, also upgradable to the King Leviathan. The Alin have the Glass Dragon, also upgradable to the Elder Glass Dragon. The Cuotl hold the City of Vengeance, upgradable to Great City of Vengeance. Three other master units, the Elder Glass Golem, the Moon Gorilla, and the Scavenger Boss can be created by the neutral sites the Glass Lair, the Moon Core, and the Scrapyard respectively. The Elder Glass Golem is a massive beast that resembles the Alins' Glass Golem but is much larger, has no ranged attack, and has a mana counter just like an Alin hero's. It also splits into 2 Adult Glass Golems when killed. The Moon Gorilla is a giant relative of the Cuotl Sun Idol with a powerful attack and siege attack ability, supplemented with a strong air attack and devastating trample. The Scavenger Boss acts like a Land Leviathan. Yet another unit that can be acquired in another map, created in the Moon Temple, is Ix the Moon God, the fourth Cuotl deity.\n\nEach race has its own set of Hero Units. Hero units are generally stronger, faster and more powerful than normal units, as well as having their own unique skill tree, which gives the hero powers, or upgrades existing powers. For the most part, powers act like spells, and are cast during the game, though there are some passive powers too. Heroes also level up (the conditions for levelling up varies), with each level increasing their stats. Heroes have to be summoned into the game, which costs a certain number of resources (different per hero), and multiple heroes can be summoned at the same time. As well, if a hero dies, he can be resummoned. There are three heroes per civilization, and these heroes have larger roles in the single-player campaigns [along with other heroes not included in Single- and Multi-player Random Maps].\n\nThe single player game is divided into three campaigns, one for each race in the game (although the \"player character\" throughout all three campaigns is Giacomo, the original Vinci hero, whose appearance and army changes depending on which campaign is being played). Each campaign presents the player with a large map of a region of Aio, divided into multiple city sections (similar to the board game \"Risk\"). The campaigns are divided into two segments: managing the Strategic Map and playing individual scenarios.\n\nThe strategic map is an overview of the current region that the campaign being played covers. It is divided into a number of smaller sections, each of which representing a scenario to be played. Each of these sections are colour-coded as well, representing which race (in the Alin campaign), or the army (in the Vinci and Cuotl campaigns) controls it. As well, the strategic map contains a representation of the player's army (represented by an avatar of Giacomo), as well as any enemy armies that are on the map, represented by an avatar of each of their heroes.\n\nEach section of the region contains a capital city. Similar to cities in scenarios, capital cities can be upgraded with four different districts (Military, Merchant/Reactor, Industrial/Magic, Palace). The capital cities allow for management of four critical resources – Research, Military, Wealth and Hero:\nSimilarly to cities within a scenario, capital cities on the strategic map can be upgraded with Palace districts after three and six other districts have been added to the city. Palace districts supply one of each resource type (other than Hero) per turn.\n\nThe player is given access to the strategic map in between playing scenarios (each of which makes up a \"turn\"). After each turn, new resources are allotted (if applicable) and enemy armies may move or capture sections (including ones under the player's control). The player then can choose which section to move their army into next (thereby starting the associated scenario); often, there is more than one path that can be taken. The player may also move their army into an adjacent friendly territory before launching a scenario. However, if the player makes two moves without starting a scenario, enemy armies will all receive a turn, while the player's resources will not increase.\n\nIn order to defeat enemy armies, the player has to either conquer a territory the army is located within, or defeat the army's capital city territory (in this case, defeating the enemy army in a non-capital city territory will cause the army to retreat). In any case, entering a scenario in a territory occupied by an enemy army will cause that army (and its associated hero unit) to be present in the scenario. Enemy armies can also attack the player's territories. Each turn that an enemy army attacks a territory destroys one of its Military districts, if any exist. When no Military districts exist, the attacking enemy army takes control of the district.\n\nTo complete a campaign, all territories do not need to be under the player's control; rather, all territories marked as main quest goals (with an icon of a golden chalice) need to be completed.\n\nThe single-player campaign is divided into a number of different scenarios, each of which being its own level, which are accessible by moving the player's army into a territory on the strategic map. The levels generally are of one of two types:\n\n\nAt the end of each level, the player is rewarded with a number of hero points in order to upgrade their Hero units. As well, each scenario is assigned a number of other upgrades on the strategic map, which are awarded upon victory; these include special powers which can be used in future scenarios (a unique set of eight such powers exists for each campaign), extra army units, or bonus Military/Research/Wealth points for use on the strategic map.\n\nThere are three unique races in \"Rise of Legends\" - the research-driven Vinci, the magic-using Alin, and the technologically advanced Cuotl.\n\nThe Vinci are a highly technological, steampunk civilization, whose buildings and armed forces rely heavily on the steam engine, clockwork and gunpowder. Its designs are highly influenced by the sixteenth century Italian Renaissance inventor and artist, Leonardo da Vinci. They are led by Giacomo, the Inventor of Miana, who provides the Vinci with a wide variety of creations to use on the battlefield. The main Vinci adversary is the Doge of Venucci, who has created a giant city-leveling cannon, the \"Doge Hammer,\" and was responsible for the death of Giacomo's brother, Petruzzo, Lord of Miana.\n\nThe Vinci national power is Industrial Devastation, which causes giant bores and drills to rise from beneath the earth, damaging anything in the area, throwing smaller units to the ground, and prohibiting the construction of buildings on that area for a short time. Further research into the Mining research track increases the power and radius of the attack. The Vinci also have access to a unique form of currency, \"Prototype Points,\" which are gained by building Industrial Districts. These Research Points are spent at a specialized structure, the Prototype factory: for each point, the player is allowed to choose one of three topics, which may grant them army-wide upgrades, unique units which cannot be gained any other way, or an increase in Timonium income. Later, the player may also choose to receive large amounts of Wealth, an upgrade in unit production, or a free powerful unit.\n\nThe Alin are a magical civilization, relying on Sand, Fire and Glass magic to create their infrastructure and army. The civilization is based on Arabian and Middle Eastern mythologies, such as \"1001 Arabian Nights\", and contains units such as Giant Scorpions, Salamanders and Dragons. They live in the Kalahese desert, mainly in the capital city of Azar Harif, and are led by the King and his daughter Arri, a master of fire magic.\n\nA large portion of the Alin territories are \"infected\" with Dark Glass, a powerful magical element, created by the Genie Sawu when a mystical object fell from the sky (it was actually a powerful, and destructive, piece of Cuotl technology), that drove him to madness. In order to attempt to contain the infection, Sawu was imprisoned inside the city of Mezekesh, which was subsequently buried within the sands of the desert. However, the infection still spread, causing intermittent periods of Dark Terror, in which hostile Dark Glass creatures became berserk and attacked the Alin without mercy.\n\nThe Alin national power is Summon Army, which immediately summons a temporary army to fight for the Alin. The power and size of the army increases with further research along the Evocation track, ranging from a minor battalion to a medium-sized cadre. This, along with the general cheapness of their units and the ability to build unit-making structures anywhere on the map, even enemy territory (though this doubles the structure's cost), makes them adept at both hit-and-run and number-based tactics.\n\nThough the larger bulk of Cuotl civilization is made up of subjugated indigenous humans, the race is headed by an alien civilization, inspired by the ancient Mayan civilization and the ancient astronaut theory from \"Chariots of the Gods? Unsolved Mysteries of the Past\". Their name resembles that of the Aztec/Mayan God Quetzalcoatl, and indeed a Cuotl air unit is called a \"Quetzal Fighter\". Four Cuotl beings, possessing high technology indistinguishable from magic, installed themselves as gods over the tribes of the Aio rainforest: Ix, the Moon God; Xil, the Sun God; Shok, Goddess of Storm; and Czin, God of Death. The units of the Cuotl army have both Mesoamerican and science-fiction influences to their design, seemingly constructed from both metal and stone, and many of them feature energy shields or personal cloaking devices. An obvious example of their Mesoamerican influence is Czin's name, which is very similar to that of Kisin's alternate spelling, Cizin, and who like Czin is also a death god.\n\nThe Cuotl are logistically different from the other two civilizations in the game. Instead of collecting Wealth via caravans, the Cuotl harvest Energy through reactors, which is used to create buildings and fund heroes' powers. Similarly, rather than purchasing neutral sites with Wealth as the other two civilizations do, the Cuotl expend Timonium to \"subjugate\" them. (Because Timonium is so much easier to obtain than Wealth or Energy, this creates game-balance issues which are resolved by the sharply-increasing costs of subjugation overall.)\n\nThe Cuotl national power, Star Bolt, summons a contracting halo of intense light, which damages all enemy units and structures within its circumference. Curiously, it is selectable by mouse and can be moved, allowing the player to chase opposing units with it or use it for reconnaissance. By researching the Divine Power research track, the size, power and duration of the Star Bolt increases.\n\nSome pieces of Cuotl technology are dangerous or unstable. One was found by the entity who would become known as Sawu the Dark Alin, and prompted the creation of the corrupting Dark Glass. Another was found within a Mianan mine, and started killing those miners who were exposed to its presence. Yet another piece of Cuotl technology was given to the Doge of Venucci, who incorporated the destructive laser cannon into his personal walker; this cannon overloaded when Giacomo pulled some wires from it, resulting in the Doge's death.\n\nEach area of Aio (occupied by the Vinci, Alin and Cuotl) also contain a number of neutral factions, which often have their own unique army units, and can be captured, purchased or subjugated in order to join the player's army. Each neutral faction is only available in one of the three civilizations' territories, and each civilization can obtain the power to create camps belonging to one of their neutral factions. Examples of neutrals are the unindustrialized Vinci men who still ride on horses and live in castles, known as Condottieri, the tribal nomads of the northern mountains, clockwork units created from scrap metal, known as Scavengers, and Cuotl humans who have refused worship of the false gods, known as Fallen Cuotl.\n\nThe game takes place on the world of Aio. Years ago, an alien ship crashed on the planet, breaking into 4 parts. Each part fell on a different region.\n\nThe game begins as Lord Petruzzo, ruler of the Vinci city of Miana, his brother Giacomo, and General Carlini are sent with a group of soldiers to recover an object found in a mine shaft that is making the miners sick. When they arrive, they are attacked by the Doge of Venucci, a bloodthirsty warlord, who has already captured the mysterious device. The Doge fires a laser beam at a nearby outcrop, causing an avalanche. The rubble crushes Petruzzo and many of the soldiers. Giacomo sets out on a quest to kill the Doge and avenge his brother.\n\nAlong the way, Giacomo's army helps the land of Pirata break a Venucci siege, and Lenora, their leader, joins Giacomo on his quest. Further on, they liberate Venucci political prisoners, and discover that Venucci has access to unknown technology.\n\nGiacomo levels Venucci using a weapon that the Doge intended for Miana, Giacomo's home city, called the Doge Hammer. However, he discovers that the Doge has taken another Hammer to Miana while the battle at Venucci was fought. On returning to Miana, Giacomo finds the city destroyed.\n\nHe pursues the Doge into the Alin Desert, where the army is attacked by the Dark Alin Marwan. They are saved by an army led by Giacomo's friend, the Alin princess Arri. She takes Giacomo to the Alin king, who gives him rest but does not offer military aid. He tells the story of Sawu, the Dark Alin who was driven mad by an object that fell from the sky. Sawu began covering the land in a substance called Dark Glass. To stop the spread of Sawu’ influence, he was sealed in the city of Mezekesh. Giacomo leaves to break the seal and stop Sawu once and for all. He is accompanied by Arri, while Lenora returns to Pirata to prepare her armies.\n\nDefeating Sawu cures his insanity. As Sawu is defeated, however, the Doge arrives to take the object that drove Sawu mad. With the help of the armies of Pirata, the object is kept away from the Doge, who is killed. An alien ship arrives at this time to take the Sawu's artifact and the one the Doge stole at the beginning of the game.\n\nGiacomo wants to know more about these \"aliens\", so he travels to Cuotl Rainforest, where there have been reports of them being seen. When he arrives, he finds Ix, the Moon God, one of the False Gods that rule the Cuotl, searching for an object like the ones mentioned before, now revealed to be pieces of Cuotl technology. Giacomo battles with Ix, but is nearly defeated until Carlini arrives and kills Ix. Czin, the god of death, then arrives, seeking the device. Giacomo attempts to stop him, but is badly injured when the device explodes. Carlini challenges Czin, who kills Carlini with little effort.\n\nGiacomo has gained strange new powers from the explosion, which have altered his body and mind. He spends some time building a robotic walker suit to simulate the power that Ix had, so that he can avenge Carlini's death. He is joined by Kakoolha, rightful leader of the Cuotl, in his assault on the Cuotl gods. When Giacomo's army reaches Czin's capital city, they discover that the Death God is preparing a massive machine that will \"talk to the Stars\" and bring about the apocalypse. Giacomo confronts Czin inside the massive machine, and eventually kills him. After slaying Czin, Giacomo is faced by a mysterious holographic image of what appears to be an alien. Giacomo then destroys the machine while still inside it, and the entire structure explodes.\n\nLater, in the Vinci city-states, statues of Giacomo are made in remembrance of him, and Lenora is now tasked with the matter of unifying the Vinci under a single banner. Arri leaves to travel the world, exiled by her father, the king, for helping Giacomo. The Cuotl, under Kakhoola's rule, are adapting to the new technology the False Gods spread among them.\n\n38 Studios acquired the rights to \"Rise of Nations\" and \"Rise of Legends\", when it acquired Big Huge Games in 2009. After 38 Studios filed for bankruptcy in 2012 its rights to \"Rise of Nations\" were sold at an auction to Microsoft.\n\nIn 2010 an \"expansion\" of the game was released at \"Rise of Legends Heaven\". featuring many new units and other features including changes to the campaign and skirmish play. In 2013 another mod was released on the same site creating 13 new nations to expand on the games 3 nation limit.\n\nThe game received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\nThe editors of \"Computer Games Magazine\" presented \"Rise of Legends\" with their 2006 \"Best Art Direction\" and \"Best Interface\" awards, and named it the year's ninth-best computer game overall. They called it \"a weirdly absorbing trinket whose true dazzle reveals itself only gradually to the patient eye.\"\n\n\nDespite its positive critical reception, the game sold one-third as many copies as its predecessor \"Rise of Nations\".\n\n"}

Preparation of traditional cochinita involves marinating the meat in strongly acidic citrus juice, adding annatto seed which imparts a vivid burnt orange color, and roasting the meat while it is wrapped in banana leaf.\n\n\"Cochinita\" means baby pig, so true cochinita pibil involves roasting a whole suckling pig. Alternatively, pork shoulder (butt roast), or pork loin is used in many recipes. The high acid content of the marinade and the slow cooking time tenderizes the meat, allowing otherwise tough pieces of meat to be used. The Yucatecan recipes always employ the juice of Seville or bitter oranges for marinating. In areas where bitter oranges are not common, juice of sweet oranges combined with lemons, limes, or vinegar are employed to approximate the effect of the bitter orange on the meat. Another important ingredient in all pibil recipes is achiote (annatto), which gives the dish its characteristic color and adds to flavor.\nIt is usually eaten with side dishes such as: yellow corn tortillas, red pickled onion, refried black beans and habanero chilies. \nTraditionally, cochinita pibil is buried in a pit with a fire at the bottom to roast it.\n\nCochinita pibil is a recurring element of the movie \"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\" directed by Robert Rodriguez, where it is the favorite food of a CIA agent played by Johnny Depp, who orders this dish every time he enters a Mexican restaurant and urges every person he has lunch with to taste it. He will go as far as killing a cook because his puerco pibil is \"too good\". \n\nRodriguez also includes a recipe for puerco pibil and demonstrates how to prepare it in the special features section of the DVD.\n\n\n"}

Windesheim is also renowned for its innovative and entrepreneurial approach. Windesheim has many close ties with the business community and public institutes which makes the knowledge immediately applicable in practice. All students do internships at and projects together with companies and institutes during their study programme. This way of working empowers the professional field around Windesheim and their graduates.\nStudent reviews can be found here.\n\nWindesheim has over 50 bachelor programmes in the following fields of expertise:\n- Business, Media and Law\n- Education \n- Engineering and ICT\n- Health and Social Work\n- Journalism and Communication\n- Sport and Therapy\n\nTwo programmes are English taught: Global Project and Change Management, and International Business. Besides this, Windesheim offers approximately 25 English taught exchange programmes and (in Dutch) over 180 post graduate programmes, associate degrees, master programmes and courses for professionals.\n\nWindesheim as it currently exists was formed in 1986 as the result of the merger of several education providers. The merger took place over a number of years with more and more institutions joining. The academy for Journalism and the academy for Social Studies from Kampen became part of the new institute as well as the School of Physical Exercise from Arnhem. Most of the education providers who joined were located in Zwolle: Higher Education in Economics and Administration (HEAO), Higher Education in Engineering and Technology (HTS), College of Education, School of Nursing, Academy of Journalism and Higher Education in Information Technology. These separate institutions all became part of Windesheim which then joined forces on an administrative level with the VU University Amsterdam. In 2012 this set up was discontinued and both institutions now have their own board and organization behind them. In September 2006, it changed its degree system to the bachelor/master system.\n\nhttp://www.windesheim.com/\n"}

Ivatt and built originally for the Great Northern Railway as their class L1. These locomotives were intended for suburban passenger service, but did not prove satisfactory, so they ended up on freight service.\n\nOther examples include the LNWR 1185 Class and the Port Talbot Railway 0-8-2T (Cooke) and Port Talbot Railway 0-8-2T (Sharp Stewart).\n\nDorrigo Steam Railway and Museum has preserved Avonside 0-8-2 Tank Locomotive number 14, formerly operated by South Maitland Railways collieries line in the Hunter Valley of N.S.W. Number 14 is operational, it was built in 1909 in Bristol. The design combination of this 0-8-2 tank Locomotive and the N.S.W. Government Railways 50 class 2-8-0, produced the South Maitland Railways 10 class 2-8-2 Tank Locomotives. Number 14 is the only 0-8-2 in Australia.\n\nThe 0-8-2 was not a common wheel arrangement. In North America, its use was confined to 2-8-2 \"Mikado\" types assigned to switcher roles; the lead truck was often removed to give more weight on drivers, a guiding truck not being needed at slow speed. However, the Illinois Central rebuilt some of their 2-8-2s into 0-8-2s for use in Markham Yard in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nThe arrangement has proved a little more popular on narrow-gauge and minimum-gauge lines, where the lack of leading wheels was less important due to the relatively slow operating speeds. \n\n0-8-2 locomotives operate, for example, on the Zillertalbahn in Austria. The X class locomotives of the metre-gauge Nilgiri Mountain Railway in the Nilgiri Hills of southern India has a class 0-8-2T rack and pinion compound locomotives built by the Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works, Winterthur. \n\nOne Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway, 0-8-0T locomotive was rebuilt in 1927, as an 0-8-2 tender locomotive named \"River Irt\". It has remained in traffic on passenger duties ever since and is now the oldest working 15 inch gauge locomotive in the world.\n"}

The screenplay concerns U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1921 illness, diagnosed at the time as polio, his struggle to overcome paralysis, his discovery of the Warm Springs resort, his work to turn it into a center for the rehabilitation of polio victims, and his resumption of his political career. Roosevelt's emotional growth as he interacts with other disabled people at Warm Springs prepares him for the challenges he will face as President during the Great Depression.\n\nThe film begins with a scene of the 1920 presidential election, in which Harvard educated lawyer, New York assemblyman and assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt makes a rousing speech mentioning his cousin Teddy. Roosevelt is the vice presidential candidate on the ticket with James Cox. They are overwhelmingly defeated by Republican Warren Harding but the seeds are planted for Roosevelt's rise to greatness . In the beginning, he is portrayed as rather arrogant looked upon as a lightweight by opponents (they mock his initials FDR as standing for feather duster). His wife Eleanor discovers evidence of an affair and it is only the intervention of Roosevelt's domineering mother that prevents a divorce, however Eleanor is never able to forgive him and they only have a marriage of convenience. Roosevelt's friend and political advisor Louis Howe is determined to make him the President of the United States. However, Roosevelt is crippled by polio and forced to accept the possibility that he may never walk again. Throughout the ordeal he and Eleanor are able to bond and Roosevelt becomes more compassionate. He goes to Warm Springs for treatment and discovers the joy of being able to stand again in the heated pool. The film ends with Roosevelt attending the nominating convention of Al Smith in 1928.\n\nActress Jane Alexander, who plays FDR's mother Sara Delano Roosevelt, also played Eleanor Roosevelt in the acclaimed 1976 telefilm \"Eleanor and Franklin\" and its 1977 sequel \"\". Many of the bit part actors in the film are actually physically challenged, though Branagh and several other of the principal actors are not. The withered appearance of Branagh's legs was achieved through the use of CGI.\n\nThe film was produced by HBO Films and directed by Joseph Sargent. The majority of the film was made at Warm Springs, Georgia and its surrounding locations. The producers strove to make sure that many of the physical details were as authentic as possible. For example, Kenneth Branagh, as Roosevelt, is seen driving the very same specially-equipped automobile that FDR was taught to drive at Warm Springs. The cottage that Roosevelt stays in during the film is one of the cottages that the real FDR stayed in. And the swimming pool in which the patients swim in is the actual therapeutic swimming pool at Warm Springs, refurbished specifically for the film.\n\nThe film received near-unanimous praise by the critics, and won five Primetime Emmy Awards out of sixteen nominations, including \"Outstanding Made for Television Movie\", \"Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or Movie\" (Jane Alexander), \"Outstanding Music Composition for a Miniseries, Movie, or Special (Original Dramatic Score)\" (Bruce Broughton), \"Outstanding Art Direction for a Miniseries or Movie\" and \"Outstanding Single-Camera Sound Mixing for a Miniseries or Movie\". Joseph Sargent, who was also Emmy-nominated for his direction, did not win; however, he was nominated and won the Directors Guild of America Award. Screenwriter Margaret Nagle won the Writers Guild of America Award for her script. The film was also nominated for three Golden Globe Awards, but did not receive any.\n\nRoosevelt was diagnosed with polio in 1921, but his symptoms are more consistent with Guillain–Barré syndrome - an autoimmune neuropathy which his doctors failed to consider as a diagnostic possibility.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1872476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872476", "title": "Wash Tubbs", "text": "Wash Tubbs\n\nWash Tubbs was an American daily comic strip created by Roy Crane and Leslie Turner that ran from April 14, 1924 to 1949, when it merged into Crane's related Sunday page, \"Captain Easy\". Turner left both strips in 1943 to begin \"Buz Sawyer\", but a series of assistants kept the combined \"Captain Easy\" daily and Sunday strips going until October 1, 1988.\n\nInitially titled Washington Tubbs II, it originally was a gag-a-day daily strip which focused on the mundane misadventures of the title character, a bespectacled bumbler who ran a store. However, Crane soon switched from gag-a-day to continuity storylines. He reinvented the strip after its 12th week to make it the first true action/adventure comic strip, initially by having Tubbs leave the store and join a circus. To research this, Crane spent many days with a circus, even incorporating characters in the strip based directly on the circus performers he knew personally. \n\nWash was a girl-crazy zany, and his character never truly changed even as the strip changed around him. After a Polynesian treasure hunt in which Wash made and lost a fortune, adventures followed in which he fell afoul of his arch-enemy, Bull Dawson, who reappeared throughout the series. Since the short Wash was not a fighter, Crane tried out several scrappier sidekicks until May 6, 1929, when he introduced Captain Easy, a tough, taciturn Southerner with a mysterious past. Easy gradually took over the strip and became its lead character, getting his own Sunday page, \"Captain Easy, Soldier of Fortune\", starting July 30, 1933. Wash continued to appear as a supporting character, but he became steadily less important during the 1940s. \n\nThe Tubbs and Easy characters were owned by the Newspaper Enterprise Association syndicate. Crane left that syndicate and abandoned the strips in 1943 to begin \"Buz Sawyer\", a strip he would own outright. Crane's last daily \"Wash Tubbs\" strip ran on May 29, 1943.\n\nAfter Crane’s departure, control of the strip then passed to Crane’s assistant, Leslie Turner, who had ghosted on the daily strip since 1937. Turner's assistant Walt Scott drew the Sunday page. Easy was in the Army by that time, and Tubbs had an increasingly unimportant role, so both daily and Sunday strips displayed the name \"Captain Easy\" in 1949 (with \"Wash Tubbs\" fading away).\n\nScott drew the Sunday strip until 1952, when Turner took it over with inks by assistant Bill Crooks. began ghosting the Sunday page in 1960. Turner continued to draw the daily strip until he retired in 1969, with his last credited daily strip running January 17, 1970.\n\nFollowing Turner's departure, the strips passed to his assistants, Bill Crooks (art) and Jim Lawrence (story). The pair produced both the daily and Sunday strips from January 19, 1970 to May 23, 1981. When Lawrence left in May 1981, the Sunday page ended. Mick Casale joined as the new writer, and he and Crooks produced the daily strip until it was discontinued on October 1, 1988.\nStarting February 27, 1927, a \"Wash Tubbs\"-themed topper, or subsidiary strip, appeared over the Sunday page of J. R. Williams' \"Out Our Way with the Willets\" Sunday strip. Originally an extension of the gag-a-day comic strip, the topper shifted focus to become \"A Wash Tubbs Game\" from September 4, 1932 to January 29, 1933. After this, the comic strip returned for a few weeks, and then became \"Wash Tubbs Comical Jigsaw Puzzle\" from March 19 to May 7, 1933. The topper was then turned into a children's craft-ideas panel called \"Goofy-Ginks\", and ran until September 24, 1933.\n\nWash Tubbs and Captain Easy were featured in Big Little Books during the 1930s. They also appeared in Dell comic books from 1936 (Captain Easy, as early as \"The Funnies\" #1, October 1936 cover date) and 1937 (Wash Tubbs, as early as \"The Comics\" #1, March 1937 cover date) into the 1940s.\n\nThe entire 1924–43 run of Crane’s strip was reprinted in \"Wash Tubbs and Captain Easy\", an 18-volume series with biographical and historical commentary by Bill Blackbeard and design by Bhob Stewart. This series was published by NBM Publishing (Nantier, Beall, Minoustchine) on a quarterly schedule from 1987 to 1992. \n\nIn 2009, Fantagraphics Books began a series of hardback books reprinting \"Captain Easy\" Sunday strips in color, to be followed by a separate series reprinting dailies.\n"}

On February 26, 1929, Crane introduced taciturn toughguy Captain Easy, who soon took over the strip. On July 30, 1933, Crane launched \"Captain Easy, Soldier of Fortune\" as a Sunday page starring Easy.\n\nCaptain Easy was a chivalrous Southern adventurer in the classic adventure-hero mold. After a series of globe-trotting adventures, Easy enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War II, afterwards becoming a private detective.\n\nThe Sunday adventures were initially unconnected to those of the \"Wash Tubbs\" strip and dealt with Easy's adventures prior to meeting Tubbs. They are considered a \"tour-de-force\" by Crane, who crafted layouts intended to be seen as a coherent whole rather than a disparate collection of panels.\nComics historian R. C. Harvey described Crane's Sunday page innovation: \n\nUnfortunately, in 1937, the Newspaper Enterprise Association syndicate, which employed Crane and owned the strip, introduced a new policy requiring Sunday pages designed so the panels could be rearranged into different formats. Crane then turned the Sunday pages over to his assistant Leslie Turner, so he could concentrate on the daily strip.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 18, 1993. In the episode, Bart, intoxicated from an all-syrup Squishee, mistakenly joins the Junior Campers, a Boy Scout-style organization. Homer and Bart join a father-son rafting trip which goes awry when they are stranded at sea.\n\nThe episode was written by Dan McGrath and directed by Jeffrey Lynch. Ernest Borgnine guest starred in the episode as himself. He recorded his lines at the Village Recorder in West Los Angeles. The episode makes cultural references to the films \"My Dinner with Andre\", \"The Terminator\", \"On the Town\", \"\"Crocodile\" Dundee\", \"Deliverance\", \"Friday the 13th\", and \"Boyz n the Hood\" (in the title) as well as the song \"Sugar, Sugar\" by The Archies. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 13.0, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.\n\nBart and Milhouse find $20 that Homer lost and order a Super Squishee made entirely of syrup from Apu at the Kwik-E-Mart. With their senses reeling from the high sugar content, they spend the rest of the money on a bender in Springfield. The next morning, Bart wakes up with a hangover and realizes he joined the Junior Campers, an organization like the Boy Scouts, during his revelry.\n\nBart plans to quit the group as soon as possible, but he attends a meeting to avoid a pop quiz at school. When he learns that Junior Campers are issued pocket knives, he keeps attending meetings. Homer mocks him relentlessly for embracing the scouts. When a father-son rafting trip is planned, neither Bart nor Homer wish to go together. They offer invitations to each other thinking they will both refuse them, but inadvertently end up agreeing to attend. Homer is distressed when he learns that he and Bart will share a raft with Ned and his son Rod.\n\nWhen Homer loses the map after folding it into a makeshift hat that blows away, they paddle the wrong way and find themselves lost at sea. Their plan to ration the little food onboard fails when Homer greedily eats most of it. They are stranded with no food or water for several days; the Springfield Police Department refuses to search for them because their rescue boat is out of refreshments. The raft springs a leak after Homer accidentally drops a pocket knife he was intending to gift to Bart. All seems lost, but Homer smells the scent of food from a Krusty Burger on an unmanned offshore oil rig and places a large order. Bart is proud of his father after the rafting party survives their ordeal.\n\nLed by Ernest Borgnine, the other Junior Campers take the right route but suffer a worse fate: they become trapped in a dark, tangled swamp while being hunted by mountain men. Borgnine is unable to repel a bear attack because Homer has stolen his Swiss Army knife, so they flee to an abandoned summer camp. They start singing campfire songs, but soon \nan unseen figure lurking in the woods — strongly implied to be Jason Voorhees — attacks them.\n\n\"Boy-Scoutz 'n the Hood\" was written by Dan McGrath and directed by Jeffrey Lynch. The episode was recorded at the Village Recorder in West Los Angeles. Ernest Borgnine guest starred in the episode as himself. The staff liked his work on the films \"Marty\" and \"From Here to Eternity\", so they asked him to do a guest appearance on the show. Borgnine felt he could not say no to the offer because his grandchildren were fans of the show. In the final scene of the episode, Borgnine plays a guitar and sings campfire songs with the children. Borgnine was a guitar player in real life, so he brought his own guitar with him to the recording studio. Borgnine apologized because he felt that he was not being able to sing very well, but Nancy Cartwright, who provides the voice of Bart, thought his voice \"added to the authenticity of his character\". \"The Simpsons\"s creator Matt Groening thought the recording sessions with Borgnine were \"so much fun\". Hank Azaria, who provides the voice of Apu, commented that Borgnine \"had no idea what the hell he was doing. He's a good actor, and he read his lines just fine, but he had no idea what the show was, no idea what we were doing.\"\n\nIn her book \"My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy\", Cartwright comments that she was a fan of Borgnine's performance in \"Marty\". She writes that the film had \"changed [her] forever\", and that it made her \"realize that actors have the power through their work to inspire and enlighten others.\" She recalls that when Borgnine arrived for the recording session, she \"lost all coolness\" and ran up to him and exclaimed \"ohmygod, Marty!\"\n\nWhen Bart and Milhouse visit the local video arcade at the beginning of the episode, Martin Prince is seen playing an arcade game based on the 1981 film \"My Dinner with Andre\". Other games at the arcade include a game based on the 1984 film \"The Terminator\". The \"Springfield, Springfield\" number performed by Bart and Milhouse on their night out in town is a reference to the musical number \"New York, New York\" from the film \"On the Town\", starring Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. During a scene in which Hans Moleman and Moe fight with knives, Hans tells Moe, \"You call that a knife? This is a knife!\", a reference to a line from the 1986 film \"\"Crocodile\" Dundee\". Ernest Borgnine introduces himself a la Troy McClure to the Junior Campers by recalling his role in \"From Here to Eternity\", a film which modern children are unlikely to have seen. During a hallucination, Homer imagines himself singing the song \"Sugar, Sugar\" by The Archies while dancing with lollipops and ice cream cones. While on the raft, Homer misquotes lines from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" when he says \"Water, water everywhere/So let's all have a drink.\" The scene in which Borgnine and the other rafters drift through a dark forest watched by mountain men is a reference to a scene in the 1972 film \"Deliverance\", and the scene features the music from the film's \"Dueling Banjos\" scene. The unseen person or creature that attacks Borgnine at the end of the episode is implied to be Jason Voorhees from the \"Friday the 13th\" film series.\n\nIn its original American broadcast, \"Boy-Scoutz 'n the Hood\" finished 35th in the ratings for the week of November 15 to November 21, 1993, with a Nielsen rating of 13.0, translating to 12.3 million households. The episode was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week.\n\nSince airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: \"A terrific episode, with Homer so stupid it isn't true, yet still saving the day. Seeing Ned Flanders get it wrong is great, but the show-stealer is a toss-up between Borgnine's great self-deprecating role, the ironic seagull, and the dolphins.\" DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson called it a \"brilliant episode from start to finish\". He commented that \"We see what an amazing amount of goods and services one can purchase in Springfield with only $20, and we get a fun spoof of scouting. Add to that terrific rivalry moments between Bart and Homer and the show excels.\" Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict called the plot of the episode \"typically inspired\", and gave it a grade of A. Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 5 out of 5. TV DVD Reviews's Kay Daly wrote: \"And just when you think the \"Simpsons\"' creators have taken parody as far as it can go, they air an episode like this. The writers cram the 22-minute episode with allusions to movie genres including disaster movies, Broadway musicals, adventure-suspense and classic teen horror.\" Adam Suraf of Dunkirkma.net named it one of his ten favorite episodes of the show. He called the musical sequence a \"classic\". Rick Porter of Zap 2 It wrote in that he was not a \"fan\" of the episode's second half: \"Despite the presence of Borgnine, Homer is a little too aggressively stupid for my taste\". He thought the first part was \"absolutely brilliant\", though.\n\nKurt M. Koenigsberger analyzed a scene from the episode in his piece \"Commodity Culture and Its Discontents\", published in the compilation work \"Leaving Springfield: The Simpsons and the Possibility of Oppositional Culture\" edited by John Alberti. He commented that \"The Simpsons\" literary and cultural awareness extends to the \"conventions of its own medium\" in this episode. Bart criticizes an \"Itchy & Scratchy\" episode because Itchy stakes down Scratchy's appendages and props his belly to form a tent with faulty knots. With Homer looking on from the couch, Lisa reminds Bart that cartoons do not simply reproduce reality, a point hammered on as a second Homer meanders past the living-room window. Koenigsberger said that \"this moment and many others like it reveal a strong sense of self-awareness within the show, an awareness especially characteristic of high modernism.\"\n\nIn the United Kingdom, when the 300th episode was shown, Sky 1 held a \"Golden D'ohnuts\" evening, in which viewers voted for their favourite episodes to win in each category. This episode won the category of: \"Best School Jinx\".\n\n"}

It is down the line from Brighton. The station is managed by Southern, who operate the majority of trains serving it; Great Western Railway and Thameslink who only run a handful of services per day during peak hours. It is one of the main stations on the West Coastway Line; all timetabled trains stop here.\n\nAt times in its history the station had been named Worthing Central. This name is sometimes incorrectly still used, either out of habit or intentionally to distinguish it from and stations.\n\nWorthing is the only station in DfT category C that has not been given a subcategory; it is listed by DfT as simply \"C\", while all other stations in this group have been divided into C1 and C2.\n\nThe station opened on 24 November 1845. The first service arrived early in the morning from Shoreham but the official opening was scheduled for mid-day. Crowds thronged on Teville Bridge adjoining the station to witness a train from Shoreham drawn by a locomotive called \"Ercombert\", probably named after Eorcenberht of Kent (died 664), a king of Kent. As the train passed under the bridge, a local band of musicians played the National Anthem.\n\nThe original station buildings opened in 1845 and are now Grade II listed. They were converted into 2 cottages sometime after 1859 when a new station was built further west. This \"new\" station was rebuilt and expanded in 1911.\n\nIn August 2007, ticket barriers were introduced separating the platforms from the ticket office. However, their effectiveness is compromised by the layout of the station insofar as the rear car park entrance leads directly to the subway connecting the platforms. A small ticket booth, frequently unmanned, has been installed in the subway in an attempt to address this issue.\nIn April 2009, the station was made fully accessible to disabled passengers, which new ticket windows which can be adjusted to height and a ramp was also provided. The station was also fitted with new folding doors.\n\nThe main station entrance is on the south side in Station Approach. The passenger car park is on the north side of the station in Southcourt Road and has a separate entrance to the station. Parking is free only on Sundays and Bank Holidays. The concourse and ticket office leads directly to the side platform (platform 3), which is used mostly for westbound services. The island platform (platforms 1 and 2) is connected to this platform by a subway, which also leads out to the car park.\n\nStation facilities include:\nThe station has three platforms, all of which are long enough to accommodate 12-carriage trains.\n\nMost trains serving the station are run by Southern with some Thameslink and GWR services at peak times, with the typical off-peak service consisting of the following:\n\nOn Sundays the eastbound service is halved in frequency (2tph to Brighton and 1tph to London Victoria), while westbound there is 1tph to Portsmouth Harbour, 1tph to Littlehampton and 1tph to Southampton Central.\n\nGreat Western Railway serves the station with two services a day to via , and , one of which continues to via , and . In the opposite direction, there is one daily service from Great Malvern (via Bristol Temple Meads). On Sundays there is no service to or from Great Malvern, but there is a service to and from Cardiff Central (via Bristol Temple Meads).\n\n "}
{"id": "1872513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872513", "title": "General Idea", "text": "General Idea\n\nGeneral Idea was a collective of three Canadian artists, Felix Partz, Jorge Zontal and AA Bronson, who were active from 1967 to 1994. \nAs pioneers of early conceptual and media-based art, their collaboration became a model for artist-initiated activities and continues to be a prominent influence on subsequent generations of artists.\n\nInitially working in Toronto, from 1968 through 1993 they divided their time between Toronto and New York before returning to Toronto for the last few months of their time together.\n\nGeneral Idea's work inhabited and subverted forms of popular and media culture, including boutiques, television talk shows, trade fair pavilions, mass media and beauty pageants. The beauty pageant, \"The 1971 Miss General Idea Pageant,\" allowed for both male and female artist to send in pictures of them wearing the taffeta dress provided. Their work was often presented in unconventional media forms such as postcards, prints, posters, wallpaper, balloons, crests and pins. Self-mythology was a continuous strategy that informed their work. They created a fictional system that self-referenced and self-legitimized, claiming a space for their local art scene in Canada. Their intent was to reach a greater audience and so their work moved from art galleries and museums to newsstands. This ensured that different types of people who spent time in different places could have a psychological or social reaction in a place comfortable to them. General Idea initially portrayed themselves as an ambiguous group, but soon realized it was causing confusion with the public. This led to a series of self portrayal or marketing images including \"Fin de Siècle\".\n\nFrom 1987 through 1994 their work addressed the AIDS crisis, with work that included some 75 temporary public art projects. Their major installation, \"One Year of AZT/One Day of AZT\", was featured as a project at the Museum of Modern Art and now resides in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada. In 2006 the three giant inflatable pills from their 1991 work \"PLA©EBO\" were displayed during Toronto's Nuit blanche.\n\nAfter publishing \"FILE Megazine\" for two years and amassing a large collection of artists books and multiples, General Idea founded Art Metropole in 1974, a non-profit space dedicated to contemporary art in multiple format: artists books, multiples, video, audio and electronic media.\n\nBoth Partz and Zontal died of AIDS in 1994. Bronson continues to work and exhibit as an independent artist, and was the director of Printed Matter, Inc in New York between 2006 and 2011. The General Idea archive now resides at the Library and Archives of the National Gallery of Canada.\n\nAA Bronson (aka Michael Tims, b June 16, 1946, Vancouver, British Columbia) attended the University of Manitoba in the School of Architecture. He dropped out of university with a group of friends to found a commune and free school. There, he became involved in writing and publishing as an editor for the Loving Couch Press. He became heavily involved with the commune and radical education movements.\n\nFelix Partz (aka Ronald Gabe, b April 23, 1945, Winnipeg Canada; d 1994, Toronto Canada) was also a student at the University of Manitoba, studying painting under Kenneth Lochhead and developed a casual acquaintance with Bronson there.\n\nJorge Zontal (aka Slobodan Saia-Levy b January 28, 1944, Parma Italy; d 1994, Toronto Canada) arrived in Caracas, Venezuela as a post-WWII refugee. He later went to Dalhousie University to study architecture, and became increasingly involved with filmmaking. This interest took him to New York to take acting lessons. By 1968, he studied video recording at Simon Fraser University, and had established links with the Vancouver art scene. He took a workshop with dancer Deborah Hay at Intermedia. He briefly met Bronson while in Vancouver.\n\nBronson came to Toronto in 1969, specifically to investigate and participate in the Rochdale College experiment. Partz's then-girlfriend Mimi Paige was involved in Rochdale College, and Partz arrived in Toronto the same year, both to visit Paige and to find a gallerist. Zontal also arrived in Toronto in 1969, with the intention of filming a documentary at Theatre Passe Muraille. Page, Partz, Bronson and Zontal all subsequently became involved in the scene in and surrounding Passe Muraille, which forged their initial collaboration.\n\nBefore long, the four, along with actor Daniel Freedman, moved into a house at 78 Gerrard St, which eventually became the first General Idea Headquarters. Their neighbour from across the street, Sharon Venne (aka Granada Gazelle), quickly became a part of the group. The name General Idea was, in fact, the result of a miscommunication at their first group exhibition, \"Concept 70\". A Space listed the title of the group's work as the name of the collective, and the mistake stuck. Bronson would later joke that it was a reference to the \"general idea\" of the group's work.\n\nThe central themes that would preoccupy General Idea throughout their career – self-mythologization, spectacle, appropriation, parody, media deconstruction, an ironic interest in commerce and the semiotics of advertising language – were clearly present in the early days of the group. They shared an interest in the forms and methods of popular culture and mass media, and were influenced by the writing of Marshall McLuhan, William Burroughs, and by the Situationist International.\n\nThe earliest activities of the group involved the use of their home: creating ersatz commercial shops, only visible to the general public through the street-facing window (a sign was always posted saying that the store would be open in 5 minutes), and creating installations and hosting exhibitions in their living room. They worked on an uncompleted film (\"God is my Gigolo\", 1969) which starred the five cohabitants, and also included Honey Novick and Tina Miller. Bronson executed a series of chain-letter mail art projects, sparked by his interest in correspondence networks and mail art.\n\nIt was via this participation in mail-art correspondence networks that the members of the group began using pseudonyms. Gabe became Private Partz, then Felicks Partz, then Felix Partz. Tims took on the name AA Bronson while co-writing an erotic novel with Susan Harrison (AA Bronson was a confusion of his nom de plume which stuck), and Saia-Levy became Jorge Zontal after a popular jazz song \"I Just Want to be Horizontal\".\n\n\"What Happened\" was a multimedia event organized for the International Festival of Underground Theatre at the St Lawrence Centre for the Arts and the Global Village Theatre in Toronto. The group's contribution was a multi-part performance based on Gertrude Stein's first play (also called \"What Happened\"). The whole play, in 5 acts and 4 intermissions, was spread across the three weeks of the festival. Events happened both within and without the theatre centre, variously documented by tape recorder, Polaroid cameras, sketch pads and VTR recorders . The documentation was sent to the theatre and displayed there. Among the performances that occurred during one of the intermissions was the \"1970 Miss General Idea Pageant\", which \"crowned\" Novick as Miss General Idea 1970. Paige and Gazelle were revealed as Miss General Ideas 1968 and 1969 (an inclusion that gave rise to the fiction that General Idea was formed in 1968).\n\nGeneral Idea initiated two large-scale mail art projects: the \"Orgasm Energy Chart\" (inviting participants to log the time and date of their orgasms) and \"Manipulating the Self: Phase 1 – A Borderline Case\" (1970–71). Participants were asked to photograph themselves holding the side of their head, and send the documentation to General Idea (who had since left their Gerrard St location for 87 Yonge St). The results were published in an eponymous pamphlet. Participation in these projects was facilitated via contact with Ray Johnson and his New York Correspondence School and the foundation of Image Bank by Michael Morris, Gary Lee Nova and Vincent Trasov – all General Idea collaborators/participants – in Vancouver.\n\nPerformed at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Pageant was General Idea's major project for the year, created via the mail art network. Sixteen finalists were pre-selected, and sent an Entry Kit by mail. The kit was a box, silkscreened with the Pageant logo, containing various items: a brown dress (\"the Miss General Idea Gown\"), a typed letter of invitation by Granada Gazelle (Miss General Idea 1969), a General Idea business card, the Pageant program, an application form, an acceptance card, and photographs of Miss Honey (Miss General Idea 1970) and the \"Artist's Conception of Miss General Idea 1971\".\n\nFinalists were asked to respond with a series of photographs of themselves modelling the \"Miss General Idea Gown\". Of the sixteen people contacted, thirteen people responded. One person – artist Janis Campbell – refused, accusing the group of being \"male chauvinist pigs.\" General Idea took her response as an entry.\n\nThe pageant was conceived of and executed as if it was a live-broadcast televised spectacle, and appropriated all of its conventions, including glamorous pre-show red carpet arrival. Audience reactions and cues were rehearsed. The judges for the Pageant were Dorothy Cameron, an art consultant, and David Silcox, a former visual arts officer of the Canada Council, the then-Dean of the Fine Art Department at York University.\n\nThe Pageant, while successful, was an enormous undertaking. The members of General Idea decided that they couldn't face organizing such an event on an annual basis. They decided that the next Pageant would take place in 1984, and the group's projects and performances would be either in service of, or explicit rehearsals for this moment. Furthermore, it would take place in a huge Pavillion (the largesse of it reflected in the tongue-in-cheek appropriation of the French spelling) built precisely for the purpose.\n\nThe selection of the date of 1984 gave the group a kind of goal, or deadline: to stay together and work together until that year. The Pageant format, and the implied timeline set by the deadline of 1984, provided them with a kind of thematic universe in which all their media experiments could be collected. Conceptually, the Pageant concretized the various self-mythologizing aspects of the General Idea project: an inhabitation and ambiguous parodying of the creative processes of the artist and the fame/commercial processes of the art world.\n\nIn 1972, the group founded \"FILE Megazine\". The publication served a dual purpose. The editorials of the magazine elaborated the group's major ideas. It also initially served as way for members of the mail art network to keep in contact with each other, and as a record of their activities. The magazine quickly garnered a worldwide following. The name and design of the magazine were meticulous spoofs of Life, and the collective hoped to use the visual familiarity as \"a kind of virus within the communication systems.\" In Issue 75: The Glamour Issue, they asserted that \"in order to be glamorous we had to become plagiarists.\" \"FILE\" ran for 26 issues, and was instrumental in the formation of a network of Canadian Artist-run centres, serving as a vehicle for artist's projects and the \"wisecracks, wordplay, and cryptic layers of fact and fiction\" of General Idea's self-mythologizing senibilities.\n\nIn 1973, as the mail-art phenomenon had begun to fade, General Idea switched their focus towards the creation of the \"1984 Miss General Idea Pavillion\" [sic]. The group began to create a series of architectural proposals that articulated various aspects of the Pavillion. The first realized installation was \"Luxon VB\", a set of double-sided mirrored Venetian blind slats. They also collected a series of talismans: \"The Hand of the Spirit\" (an effete, arched hand made of plexiglas and mounted on a wand-like handle, which originally appeared in Vincent Trasov's entry for the \"1971 Miss General Idea Pageant\"), \"The Miss General Idea Shoe\". This was all under the rubric of the Search for the Spirit of Miss General Idea – in the group's conceptual framework, an analogy for artistic inspiration and research. This framework served as a structuring principle for future performances (which continued to take the form of audience rehearsals).\n\nIn 1974, General Idea opened Art Metropole, an archive, shop and distribution centre for artist's multiples and ephemera. The announcement came via \"FILE Megazine\": \"Art Metropole intends to keep abreast of the tide, housing and distributing evidence of activity and imagery: megazines [sic], publications, videos, correspondence, snapshots, memories and the ephemeral flood.\". The shop opened on October 26 of that year, the occasion used as another opportunity to rehearse the public for the 1984 Miss General Idea Pageant.\n\nIn 1975, the group staged another performance, \"Going Thru the Motions\", again at the Art Gallery of Ontario. Similar in structure to the \"1971 Miss General Idea Pageant\" (this time including a crew of 40 people, including cameramen who recorded everything, and all the trappings of pageant or awards-show glamour), this was another audience rehearsal. The evening featured a parade of the \"VB Gowns\" (a series of ziggurat-shaped 'gowns' made of manipulated Venetian blind slats) and a performance by Rough Trade.\n\n\"Going Thru the Notions\" was shown at the Carmen Lamanna Gallery in the same year. The exhibition was a summary of the group's thinking around the 1984 Miss General Idea project. It featured architectural blueprints, the \"Pavillion Hoarding\" (installed outside the storefront window of the gallery), as well as their \"Showcards Series\" (1975–79), an articulation of themes and beliefs central to the overarching Miss General Idea project.\n\nThe group announced, via a huge performance (done as part of a residency in Kingston, Ontario), the destruction of the \"1984 Miss General Idea Pavillion\" in 1977. The performance was spectacular, featuring smoke-bombs, fire trucks and a newscast helicopter.\n\nThe destruction of the \"Pavillion\" coincided with the group's increasing profile, both in Canada and in Europe. As they kept having more shows, the performative destruction allowed them to shift roles as artists, from self-styled architects to archeologists, and gave them a conceptual grounding to shift into a more object-based art practice (as had begun to happen with the \"Showcards\" and the architectural \"features\" of the \"Pavillion\"-to-be).\n\nA series of sculptures, prints and paintings were created as \"fragments\" or \"ruins\" of the destroyed \"Pavillion\". The group used these fragments to further play with then-outré concepts: glamour, effeminacy, camp and kitsch, and by extension, homosexuality. The group adopted the poodle as their mascot. The animal appeared as a constantly repeating motif. It also served as a symbol not only of self-identification, but also as a vessel through which the group could continue their strategy of media appropriation, which in turn allowed them to respond to the artistic exigencies of operating within the larger international gallery world. The poodle images were vehicles for a series of stylistic appropriations, for instance, the orgiastic Neo-Geo \"Mondo Cane Kama Sutra\" paintings.\n\nThe group also created a series of videos in this period. \"Pilot\" (1977) was commissioned by TVOntario, \"Test Tube\" (1979) was created during a residency at the De Appel Gallery and produced for Dutch television. \"Shut the Fuck Up\" (1984) was likewise commissioned by De Appel, this time in collaboration with Time Based Arts, also for Dutch television. \"Pilot,\" an appropriation of the documentary format, is a further elaboration of the General Idea identity. \"Test Tube\" (a faux-soap opera, complete with commercials) and \"Shut the Fuck Up\" are deconstructions of and confrontations with the media distortion of the persona of the artist.\n\nThe group had been, throughout their career thus far, making multiples and editions, each of which was a further elaboration of, or in some way tied to an existing General Idea work. For instance, the products discussed in the \"Test Tube\" video \"commercials\" were turned into actual multiples (and by extension, the text of the commercials became the \"Getting Into the Spirits Cocktail Book\", an ersatz cocktail recipe book). In 1980, the group created the \"Boutique of the 1984 Miss General Idea Pavillion\". It functioned as both a display strategy and potential point of sale for General Idea's multiples.\n\nGeneral Idea's attention was increasingly focused on New York, specifically the downtown art scene. The eventual move to New York City was precipitated by an increase anti-LGBT policing in Toronto at the time (Zontal was caught in one of the routine bathhouse raids performed by police), by a backlash in Toronto against non-material art practices, as well as the group's perceived disproportionate ubiquity and clout in the city's small art scene. They relocated to New York City in 1986.\n\nThe first AIDS painting was created for an amfAR benefit. It is an appropriation of Robert Indiana's by-then ubiquitous LOVE logo (substituting, in the same visual arrangement and color composition, the letters L-O-V-E with A-I-D-S). General Idea intended for their AIDS logo to get \"out of their control\" and they found themselves successful when the logo showed up on lottery tickets, posters, and more. The group (knowing that the appropriation and the consequent image was in \"bad taste\") subsequently decided to repeat the image in a series of paintings. The initial painting was painted on a white canvas in red lettering. It was then changed to exhibit different colored backgrounds with different colored lettering. In one example, the lettering of AIDS was painted on a black and white canvas in gold. Due to the color scheme, it was not obvious to observers that the painting spelled AIDS. This painting was placed on a metal structure and was displayed around the world. Following the paintings, the AIDS logo was turned into a poster campaign called \"IMAGEVIRUS\", where the logo was wheatpasted along big sections of city blocks in New York and San Francisco (and then subsequently Berlin).\n\nThe initial reception of the AIDS works was highly controversial, especially among AIDS activists. To them, the General Idea AIDS logo was distanced and ironic, when what was called for was unambiguous and direct (in response, Gran Fury appropriated General Idea's AIDS logo and turned it into RIOT). With \"IMAGEVIRUS,\" activists interpreted General Idea as going against what activist artists should be doing, namely countering government neglect, providing safer-sex education and fighting for access to medical treatments. Furthermore, critics claimed that, in its repetitions, it drained the word of meaning at a time when a political battle being waged over the meaning of the disease itself.\nThe \"IMAGEVIRUS\" campaign continued to proliferate: as a public art project, it was displayed on the Times Square Spectacolor Board, it adorned the sides of trams in Amsterdam, and was installed in the advertising windows in New York City Subway cars. The image proliferated further, as wallpaper, public sculpture, and, at the behest of medical and charitable organizations, as stamps, postcards, and other ephemera (the image was used on the cover of the New England Journal of Medicine, and remains the logo for Deutsche AIDS Hilfe).\n\nWith Partz and Zontal's AIDS diagnoses, the group continued to address the AIDS crisis in various ways. They created a large scale installation (\"Fin de Siecle\", 1990): a faux ice floe created from sheets of styrofoam with three stuffed harp seals – a new form of animal familiar for General Idea – isolated at the installation's centre. It addresses the imminence of disaster, isolation and precarity/fragility (a photographic version of the installation was created in 1994, furthering the identification of the members of General Idea with the three endangered seals). The medical/pharmacological realities of daily coping with the disease also appeared in General Idea's work. The pill entered into the group's visual vocabulary, iterated and reiterated in various formats: as helium-filled balloons (a foil version of which was an appropriation Andy Warhol's silver balloons), as a sculptural object of various dimensions (the group created large-scale installations illustrating Partz's and Zontal's AZT intake) and as a backdrop, featured in one of the group's self-portraits, \"Playing Doctor\" (1992),\n\nThe group continued their practice of viral insertions/appropriations, recasting iconic images by Piet Mondrian and Gerrit Rietveld in the colors of the \"IMAGEVIRUS\" campaign.\n\nPartz had been commuting back and forth from Toronto to New York for most of this period. Due to his worsening health however, he remained in Toronto, eventually opting for home hospice care. Zontal and Bronson relocated to Toronto to join him in 1993. Both Zontal and Partz died in Toronto, in 1994.\n\nRetrospectives of General Idea's work continue to tour Europe and North America. \"\" was featured at the Centro Andaluz de Arte Contemporáneo, Seville, Spain from 30 January - 1 April 2007 , and included a recreation of the installations \"Magic Bullet\" and \"Magic Carpet\", as well as the major installation \"Fin de Siècle\". Before that \"Editions\" was exhibited at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, the Munich Kunstverein, Kunstwerke (Berlin), and the Kunsthalle in Zurich, Switzerland. General Idea has been featured in the Paris, Sydney, São Paulo and Venice Biennales, as well as at Documenta 8 in Kassel, Germany. Their work continues to be exhibited in group and solo shows worldwide. Recent career retrospectives include \"Haute Couture\" at the Musée d'Art Moderne de la ville de Paris, and subsequently toured to the Art Gallery of Ontario in 2010-2011. They had their first Latin American museum show/retrospective, \"General Idea: Tiempo Partido\" at Museo Jumex, Mexico City and MALBA, Buenos Aires, in 2016-2017. They continue to have solo exhibitions at Esther Schipper Gallery (Berlin), and are slated to have their first show with Mitchell-Innes and Nash in late 2017.\n\nGeneral Idea is widely recognized as a leading part of a branch of a conceptual art movement that embraced the expression of ideas in multiple media. They were instrumental in the creation and elaboration Canadian artist-run culture. They are represented in the permanent collections of numerous museums, including the National Gallery of Canada, the Museum of Modern Art (New York), the Stedelijk Museum (Amsterdam). The estate of General Idea is represented by the Esther Schipper Gallery, Berlin, Maureen Paley, London, Galerie MAI 36, Zurich and Mitchell-Innes & Nash, New York.\n\nGeneral Idea appears in Derek May's 1981 documentary film on the Toronto art scene, \"Off the Wall\".\n\n\nSmith, Sarah E.K. \"General Idea: Life & Work\".

{"id": "1872516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872516", "title": "Buz Sawyer", "text": "Buz Sawyer\n\nBuz Sawyer is a comic strip created by Roy Crane. Distributed by King Features Syndicate, it had a run from November 1, 1943 to October 7, 1989. The last strip signed by Crane was dated 21 April 1979.\n\nDuring World War II, the adventurous John Singer Sawyer, nicknamed Buz Sawyer, became a Naval Aviator and flew as an ace Navy fighter and dive bomber pilot in the Pacific Theater where he had numerous adventures with his sidekick Sweeney. As a civilian in the post-World War II years, Buz became an oil company troubleshooter, traveling to far-flung locales. He married Christy Jameson on 13 December 1948, and their son Pepper was born in 1951. Buz rejoined the Navy in the 1950s and flew carrier-based reconnaissance attack jets over Vietnam during the 1960s.\n\nRoy Crane was one of the innovators of the adventure comic strip. \"Wash Tubbs\" began in 1924 as a humorous story about the romantic adventures of Washington Tubbs, but increasingly Tubbs became involved in exciting adventures in exotic places. With the creation of the popular soldier of fortune Captain Easy in 1929, the strip became, along with \"Tarzan of the Apes\" and \"Buck Rogers\", one of the first adventure strips. However, Crane was an employee of the Newspaper Enterprise Association syndicate, which owned the rights to the Tubbs and Easy characters. Crane approached King Features with an idea for a new strip, and when they offered him ownership, he abandoned \"Wash Tubbs\" and \"Captain Easy\" in 1943, giving full concentration to launching \"Buz Sawyer\". Crane remembered the events this way:\n\nGranberry began writing \"Buz Sawyer\" during the 1940s, continuing as the strip's scripter until 1983. In 1946, 31-year-old Henry G. Schlensker, who had created \"Biff Baker\" with Ernest Lynn (1941–45), settled in Orlando, where he became Crane's art assistant. An ulcer resulted in Crane's retirement from the strip in the 1960s, but he continued to work closely with Granberry and Schlensker. After Crane's death in 1977, Schlensker began signing the strip. The duo continued as a team until 1983. When they retired, John Celardo drew the daily until it was discontinued on 7 October 1989. Schlensker, who fought with the Army Air Corps in East Asia during World War II, died in 1997 at the age of 82. \"He loved to draw, and he loved action. That strip was his whole life,\" said his wife, Virginia Schlensker.\n\nRosco Sweeney, who was Sawyer's comic-relief sidekick, was the lead character of the \"Buz Sawyer\" Sunday strip, a comedy about rural and suburban life. Sweeney largely disappeared from the dailies after World War II. Beginning in the late 1940s, Crane assigned the writing and drawing chores for the Sunday strip to cartoonist Clark Haas, who was a pioneer jet pilot. Later, Al Wenzel did the Sunday strip, which Crane brought to a conclusion on 19 May 1974.\n\nRoy Crane won the Reuben Award from the National Cartoonists Society in 1950 (when it was the Barney Award). He also won their Story Comic Book Award in 1965.\n\nThe daily \"Buz Sawyer\" has been reprinted by \"Comics Art Showcase\", Dragon Lady Press and \"Comics Revue\". Manuscript Press has published two books collecting the daily strip from the beginning. Only a few scattered Sundays have ever been reprinted. The comic strip was also adapted into a Better Little Book, \"Buz Sawyer and Bomber 13\".\n\nIn 2011, Fantagraphics Books published the first in a series of books reprinting the daily strips, along with selected Sunday strips. The first volume covers the daily strips from 1 November 1943 (the first strip) until 5 October 1945 (when Buz leaves the Navy). The second volume covers daily strips from October 1945 to July 1947, along with the Salvaduras Sunday sequence, and came out in 2012. The third volume covers daily strips from July 1947 to July 1949, and came out in 2014. The fourth volume covers daily strips from July 1949 to June 1952, and came out in 2016.\n\nIn June 2006, King Features' email service, DailyINK, now Comics Kingdom, began running \"Buz Sawyer\" dailies from the beginning. By 2009, this run had brought Buz into civilian life. All of these strips are missing the bottom quarter inch of art.\n\nStory arcs in the early years of the daily strip:\n\n"}

She was the first Queen consort of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, as Baldwin's brother and predecessor Godfrey of Bouillon was unmarried. \n\nHer name is unrecorded in contemporary sources, but since the 17th century she has been traditionally called Arda. She was the daughter of a minor Armenian noble named Thathoul (or Thoros), lord of Marash. Baldwin married her in 1097 after the death of his first wife, Godehilde, who had travelled with him on the First Crusade. Thoros promised 60,000 \"bezants\" as a dowry. This was a politically convenient marriage, as Baldwin was the first Count of Edessa, a crusader state carved out of Armenian territory in Mesopotamia. \n\nBaldwin succeeded his brother as King of Jerusalem in 1100, but Arda did not immediately accompany him south; she travelled by sea and arrived probably in 1101. In 1105 Baldwin had the marriage annulled, supposedly because Arda had been unfaithful, or, according to Guibert of Nogent, because she had been raped by pirates on the way to Jerusalem. In reality, Thoros had paid very little of the dowry, Arda had produced no children, and an Armenian wife was less useful in Jerusalem than in Edessa. Fulcher of Chartres, the chronicler closest to Baldwin, does not mention the matter at all, which likely means that Baldwin had no legitimate reason to annul the marriage. Instead, he simply forced Arda to enter the monastery of Saint Anne. Arda later demanded to be released and went to Constantinople, where her father had fled when his lands were taken over by Edessa.\n\nIn 1112 Baldwin sought to marry Adelaide del Vasto, widow of Roger I of Sicily and Regent for Roger II. The marriage was arranged, although Baldwin was legally still married to Arda. Patriarch Arnulf of Chocques was deposed for having supported the marriage, but was reinstated by Pope Paschal II in 1116, on condition that the marriage was annulled; Baldwin agreed and then attempted to bring Arda back from Constantinople. Arda never returned, and Baldwin died in 1118. The dates of Arda's birth and death are unknown.\n\n\n \n"}

As its name suggests, it is also on the German Wine Route (\"Deutsche Weinstraße\") in the Palatinate wine region. It belongs to the \"Verbandsgemeinde\" of Deidesheim, whose seat is in the like-named town.\n\nForst an der Weinstraße borders in the north on Wachenheim, in the northeast on Friedelsheim, in the southeast on Niederkirchen and in the south on Deidesheim.\n\nThe Salian Count Johann, Emperor Heinrich IV's nephew and from 1090 to 1104, as Johann I, Prince-Bishop of Speyer, gave his personal holdings in the Speyergau in 1100, among which was Deidesheim, as a donation to the Bishopric of Speyer. The vast woodlands north of Deidesheim, also known as \"Vorst\" or \"Forst\" (cognate with English \"forest\" and meaning the same) was excluded from this arrangement and was reserved as the Prince-Bishop's hunting ground. In this forest lie the village's beginnings, and of course its namesake. On 10 May 1525, during the German Peasants' War, Louis V, Elector Palatine led negotiations with the insurgent peasants of the \"Geilweiler Haufen\" and the \"Bockenheimer Haufen\". When the French Revolution spread to the German lands on the Rhine’s left bank, Forst, too, temporarily became part of France’s territory. In 1816, what had once been Electoral Palatinate territory on the left bank was named the \"Rheinkreis\", and later \"Rheinpfalz\", and annexed to the Kingdom of Bavaria; the Palatinate remained Bavarian until the end of the Second World War.\n\nThe council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.\n\nThe German blazon reads: \"Geteilt und unten gespalten, oben auf grünem Boden in Silber sieben grüne Bäume unterschiedlicher Länge, unten rechts in Blau ein durchgehendes silbernes Kreuz, unten links in Grün mit rotem Boden ein silbernes Gotteslamm mit goldenem Nimbus und Kreuzesfahne.\"\n\nThe municipality’s arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per fess argent on a ground vert seven trees in fess, the second, fourth and sixth taller than the others of the same, and per pale azure a cross of the first and vert on a mount gules and Agnus Dei tripping reguardant with a nimbus Or and bearing on a pole of the same a standard of the first charged with a cross of the fourth.\n\nThe arms were approved by the Bavarian Ministry of the Interior in 1902 and date from a 1725 seal. The silver cross on the blue field recalls the village’s former allegiance to the Bishopric of Speyer. The trees are a canting charge for the municipality’s name, Forst, which is also a German word for “forest”. The oldest seal mentioned above had a fourth charge, a hunter, but this does not appear in the modern arms. The arms have been borne since 20 March 1902.\n\n\n\n\nThe fecundity of the soils and the mild climate made the Romans choose to plant almonds, figs and citrus fruits here, but also especially to introduce winegrowing. Forst lies in the \"Mittelhaardt-Deutsche Weinstraße\" Region and is famous for its wineries, above all for Forster Ungeheuer, Forster Kirchenstück and Pechstein. The predominant grape variety is Riesling with a share of some 85% of the roughly 180 ha of vineyard area. The municipality's livelihood is also based increasingly on tourism, which itself is bound with winegrowing and gastronomy.\n\nForst is a “street village” – by some definitions, a “thorpe” – meaning that, originally at least, there was only one road leading through the village, in Forst's case from north to south. Nowadays, a 1.2 km stretch of this road is part of the German Wine Route. In the beginning, this was also \"Bundesstraße\" 271 linking Bad Dürkheim and Neustadt an der Weinstraße.\n\nAn early, small bypass road was built about 1970 right at the village's eastern outskirts; it has since been “assumed” by the municipality. In the 1990s, the B 271 throughout the whole region was shifted a kilometre to the east and no longer reaches the wine centres. Over the B 271 and its \"Deidesheim\" interchange, however, there has also been since then a quick link between Forst and the Autobahn A 65 (interchange 11 Deidesheim), over which Ludwigshafen can be reached in about 25 minutes and Karlsruhe in about 50. Towards the north, the B 271 leads to Bad Dürkheim and the interchange on the A 650 (Bad Dürkheim–Ludwigshafen) found there.\n\nIn 2007, 52.4% of the inhabitants were Catholic and 29.6% Evangelical. The rest practised other faiths or none.\n\n\n\n"}

He was Minister of State for Police and Criminal Justice, with his time split between the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice from 2010–2012. On 5 November 2019 he announced his decision not to stand for re-election in the December 2019 General Election.\n\nHerbert was educated at Haileybury and Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he read law and land economy. After Cambridge, he worked for the Conservative Research Department on the Rural & Environmental bureau. He went on to be appointed as the director of public affairs at the British Field Sports Society in 1990 and remained in that position for six years, from which he helped to form the Countryside Movement which later became the Countryside Alliance.\n\nHe joined Business for Sterling in 1998 as its Chief Executive where he led the launch of the 'no' campaign against adopting the Euro currency, before founding the think tank Reform as its Director in 2001, until his election to parliament in 2005.\n\nHe unsuccessfully contested the Northumberland seat of Berwick-upon-Tweed at the 1997 general election where he finished in third place some 8,951 votes behind the veteran Liberal Democrat MP Alan Beith.\n\nIn 2001 he co-founded the Reform think tank which focuses on reforming public services via private sector involvement and de-regulation.\n\nHis selection to contest the West Sussex seat of Arundel and South Downs at the 2005 general election did not come about without incident. The sitting Conservative MP, Howard Flight, had been forced to resign as a vice chairman of the party and had the whip removed by Michael Howard in 2005 after he had told a Conservative Way Forward meeting that the Conservatives would have to make more cuts than they were promising. With no whip, he was not considered as an approved candidate and, despite protest and the local association refusing to select a new candidate, he finally resigned just a month before the election. Herbert was selected and elected, holding the seat with a slightly reduced majority of 11,309. He made his maiden speech on 6 June 2005.\n\nAfter his election to Parliament, Herbert joined the Home Affairs Select Committee. After David Cameron became leader of the Conservative Party, Herbert was appointed as a Shadow Minister for home affairs on 16 December 2005. This meant he had to leave the Home Affairs Select Committee. In July 2007, he joined the Shadow Cabinet for the new position of Shadow Secretary of State for Justice, shadowing veteran Labour minister Jack Straw. On 19 January 2009 he was made Shadow Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\n\nOn the Coalition forming between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in May 2010, Herbert was appointed as a Minister of State at the Home Office with responsibility for policing and at the Ministry of Justice with responsibility for criminal justice. To undertake this role, Herbert was appointed a Privy Counsellor on 9 June 2010. He championed the introduction of elected Police and Crime Commissioners to replace police authorities, street level crime mapping, and swifter justice.\n\nHerbert decided to step down from Government at the time of David Cameron's first major reshuffle in September 2012.\n\nHerbert formed, and co-chairs, the All Party Parliamentary Group on Global TB, and in 2014 launched the Global TB Caucus which he co-chairs with South Africa's Health Minister, Aaron Motsoaledi, initiating the Barcelona Declaration with a speech to the World Lung Conference.\n\nIn 2014 he launched GovernUp, a cross-party project which aims to promote \"the far-reaching reforms needed in Whitehall and beyond to enable more effective and efficient government\". He authored Vote Conservative 2015 ahead of the general election that year.\n\nHerbert played a leading role in making the case for equal marriage, launching the Freedom to Marry campaign in 2012 ahead of the successful Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. In June 2015, Herbert helped to launch, and became the first chair, of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Global LGBT Rights.\n\nIn January 2016, Herbert launched Conservatives For Reform In Europe, a campaign to remain in the EU, subject to the Prime Minister's renegotiations. He was opposed to Brexit prior to the 2016 referendum.\n\nIn October 2019, it was announced that Herbert was rejoining the Countryside Alliance, of which he was a founder, as Chairman.\n\nIn November 2019, Herbert announced his resignation as MP in order to focus on his other campaign roles on rural issues, central governance reform, combatting tuberculosis and securing LGBT rights worldwide.\n\nHerbert joined his long-term partner, Jason Eades, in civil partnership in early January 2009. They have been in a relationship since 1999.\n\n"}

However, Northern Quebec and the Laurentides have long been strongly nationalist, a recipe for two decades of Bloc Québécois dominance. In a recent by-election were the Liberals temporally able to get the traditionally Bloquist riding of Temiscamingue, having previously gained the northern riding of Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik in 1997. \n\nSocial Credit did well here from the 1960s through the 1970s, usually winning two or three seats; Réal Caouette, the main voice of Social Credit in the province, was from this area. Hull—Aylmer was one of the few ridings outside the Montreal area that was not swept up in the Brian Mulroney tide, as it went Liberal in both 1984 and 1988; in 1984 it was one of only five Liberal-held ridings outside Montreal in the entire province. The Liberals managed to retake Gatineau in 1988. In 2006, however, everything changed as Liberal support melted here; the party lost two of their three Outaouais seats – one to the Bloc and one to the Conservatives.\n\nThe region was swept up in the massive NDP tsunami that swept through Quebec in 2011, as the NDP took every seat here by considerable margins (9,000 votes or more), ousting the region's highest-profile MP, Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon in Pontiac. The NDP even snapped up Hull—Aylmer—a seat that had been in Liberal hands since the riding's creation in 1917. In 2015, the Liberals took all of the Outoauais, and took four ridings in the Laurentides. The Bloc took three Laurentides ridings, while the NDP was reduced to the two northernmost ridings in the province. The region reverted to type in 2019. The Bloc swept the north and took all but one seat in the Laurentides, while the Liberals maintained their sweep of the Outaouais and narrowly held onto one Laurentides seat.\n\n"}

She served as Minister for Disabled People from 2010 to 2012 and served in the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and Minister for Women and Equalities from 2012 to 2014. She felt obliged to resign from the Cabinet in April 2014 because she had over-claimed expenses. the Women and Equalities Select Committee from 2015 to 2020.\n\nThe daughter of John Lewis, she was born in Wolverhampton, but was brought up in Bridgend, South Wales. She was educated at the Brynteg Comprehensive School before reading Economics at the London School of Economics from where she graduated in 1985. She joined Grey Advertising Ltd as an advertising executive, leaving in 1990 to become a marketing manager with Texaco. She rejoined Greys in 1994 and served for five years as a director, before becoming a director for the Rowland Group in 1999 for four years.\n\nMiller joined the Conservative Party in 1983 and contested Wolverhampton North East at the 2001 general election but was defeated by the sitting Labour MP, Ken Purchase. She retained formal links with the local Conservative Association for some time thereafter; she also chaired the Wimbledon Association for a year from 2002.\n\nMiller was first elected to the House of Commons at the 2005 general election, for the Basingstoke constituency, following the retirement of its former MP, the Conservative Andrew Hunter, who had defected to the Northern Ireland Democratic Unionist Party before he stepped down. In Parliament she served for a year from 2005 as a member of the Trade and Industry Select Committee. Later in 2005, David Cameron appointed her a spokesperson for the Shadow Education and Skills team. She was appointed Shadow Minister for Families in 2007. Following the 2010 general election she was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State and Minister for Disabled People at the Department for Work and Pensions.\n\nIn May 2012 she urged the Prime Minister to continue with proposals to introduce same-sex marriage in England and Wales, despite either voting against or being absent for \"all major LGBT rights votes\" since becoming an MP.\n\nOn 4 September 2012, Miller was appointed Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and Minister for Women and Equality in David Cameron's first major Cabinet reshuffle.\n\nIn February 2013 she was assessed as the 17th most powerful woman in the United Kingdom by \"Woman's Hour\" on BBC Radio 4.\n\nMiller was opposed to Brexit prior to the 2016 referendum.\n\nIn December 2012, \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that, between 2005 and 2009, Miller had claimed over £90,000 in parliamentary expenses for the mortgage and upkeep of a house in south London where her parents lived. She was subsequently reported to Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards John Lyon by MP John Mann, and an inquiry was launched into the claims. Lyon's term as commissioner finished at the end of the December, thus it would essentially be his successor, Kathryn Hudson, who undertook the investigation.\n\nAlistair Graham, who chaired the Committee on Standards in Public Life during 2003–07, said Miller's position as Culture Secretary would be \"untenable\" if Hudson found her guilty, recalling the \"very similar\" 2009 case of Tony McNulty, who resigned his ministerial positions. He also noted how Miller \"struggled\" in an interview with the \"Evening Standard\" to explain why she stopped claiming in 2009, just as the parliamentary expenses scandal exploded.\n\nMiller responded to the reports by stating that her \"financial arrangements\" had been audited on two occasions since she became an MP and no issues had been found with them, and that her parents lived with her as \"dependents\" under Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority rules. Prime Minister David Cameron was satisfied with her \"excellent\" explanation.\n\nShortly after the \"Telegraph\" broke the story on Miller's expenses, it emerged that both Cameron's spokesman, Craig Oliver, and Miller's special advisor, Joanna Hindley, had phoned the newspaper prior to publication in an attempt to warn it off. According to the paper, the pair issued a veiled threat by reminding it of Miller's role in enacting proposals in the Leveson report on press regulation. Downing Street denied that any threats were made. The newspaper later released the recording they had made of Hindley's call.\n\nHudson's investigation lasted more than a year, and was handed in to the Commons Select Committee on Standards in February 2014. In it, the standards commissioner had concluded Miller had been in the wrong, and recommended she pay back £45,000. On 3 April 2014, however, the MPs of the Standards Committee decided their commissioner had been too strict, overruling her and ordering Miller to repay instead £5,800 of wrongly claimed expenses and make a statement in the House of Commons to apologise for her \"legalistic\" lack of co-operation with the committee. She made her Commons statement the same day; the apology lasted just 32 seconds.\n\nMiller was believed to be the first serving minister to be forced to apologise for their misuse of expenses. David Cameron expressed his \"full, strong, very warm support\" for her.\n\nThe row did not die down for Miller, and her case was referred to the police by MP Thomas Docherty; Cameron expressed his wish for the press to leave the matter alone. On 4 April it was reported that Miller had even attempted to intervene in the investigation into her, telling Kathryn Hudson \"that she was acting outside the law and threatening to refer her to a Commons committee\". Alistair Graham described Miller's intervention and threats as \"fairly exceptional\", \"pretty shocking\".\n\nThe continuing saga and the perfunctory nature of her apology led to Miller haemorrhaging support from her own party. On 6 April, Labour's John Mann said, \"It is quite astonishing that Maria Miller remains in the Cabinet\". Many within her own party, including senior figures, also publicly criticised her. \"The Sunday Telegraph\" found no grassroots Tory support for Miller either, something forcefully underlined by Ben Harris-Quinney, director of Conservative Grassroots. According to \"The Guardian\", some Conservative Party criticism was revenge by the less socially-liberal elements within it for her helping drive through the legalisation of gay marriage. Some senior figures were less hostile, and Miller also found support among the more liberal \"One Nation\" grouping of Tory MPs, of which she is a member.\n\nDocuments later emerged suggesting Miller had stopped claiming expenses on her second home in Wimbledon to avoid paying capital gains tax in the event of its sale. When she did sell it, in February 2014, it was at a profit of £1 million; capital gains tax at the time was 28%. Miller refused to confirm that she would pay capital gains tax on the sale.\n\nOn 8 April 2014, in her weekly column for her local newspaper, Miller declared to her constituents that she was \"devastated\" to have let them down. However, Betty Boothroyd, Commons Speaker between 1992 and 2000, accused Miller of \"bringing Parliament into disrepute\" and said that in her view the Prime Minister should have sought Miller's resignation.\n\nOn 9 April 2014, Miller resigned from the cabinet, but did not apologise in her resignation letter. David Cameron, who had a meeting planned that day in which he was again going to tell Conservative MPs that he would not be forced into sacking Miller, expressed \"sadness\" over her stepping down, and said he hoped she would be able to return to the front bench \"in due course\". The prime minister's decisive support appeared to have remained steadfast throughout, something for which he was criticised. Miller's successor, Sajid Javid, said that \"the public were right to judge her on how she responded, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that\", and it was important for Miller to \"accept she did wrong\".\n\nMiller disclosed her experience in being harassed many times. An article published in \"The Guardian\" in 2017 mentioned Miller as saying that harassment happens frequently in industries and companies dominated by males.\n\nShe supports a campaign to expose incidents of sexual aggravation on women which gained the support of other MPs like Labour Party MP Jess Phillips and Conservative MP George Freeman. Miller also encouraged teachers to become more stringent on harassment that takes place in many schools instead of ignoring unbecoming behaviour as something marginal. According to the former Culture Secretary, head teachers must review existing school policies and regard sexual exploitation as a crime.\n\nMiller and her husband Iain, a solicitor, were married in 1990. They have two sons and a daughter.\n\n"}

He played college football at Missouri and was drafted in the 4th round of the 2006 NFL Draft by the New York Jets. He also played for the Buffalo Bills and Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nAfter being redshirted in 2001 he became the four-year starter (never missing a start) for the Missouri Tigers. His sophomore year, he established himself as a quarterback in college football, becoming only the second player in Division 1-A football history to ever pass for 2,000 yards and rush for 1,000. He received numerous national and Big 12 Conference freshman honors, leading the Tigers to a 5–7 record. His sophomore year, he led Missouri to an 8–5 record and their first bowl game since 1998. In 2004 the Tigers went a disappointing 5–6 after beginning the season ranked number 17 by the Associated Press. His senior year, he led the Tigers to a 7–5 record and his second Independence Bowl in three years and the first Missouri bowl victory in 7 years.\n\nSmith was working on his graduate degree in Economics at Missouri upon being drafted. He received his business degree from Missouri in May 2005.\n\nSmith has set numerous Missouri, Big 12, and Division 1-A records. In his junior season, he was considered a preseason Heisman Trophy candidate by many, but Missouri and Smith did not live up to expectations, achieving only a 5–6 record.\n\nSmith excelled in the classroom and was named to the Big 12 All-Academic Team. He participated in the Mike Jones Football Clinic, Chancellor's Lunch, Big Brothers and Big Sisters Bowl for Kids' Sake, Student-Athlete Advisory Committee Food Drive, Truman Club, and Athletes-in-Action, among others.\n\nSmith holds school records for career rushing yards, career total yards, most points in a game (30) and most touchdowns (5) (vs. Texas Tech on October 25, 2003).\n\nSmith was the 103rd overall selection in the 2006 NFL draft. The New York Jets drafted Smith as a Wide Receiver/Running Back/Quarterback in the fourth round. He was signed by the New York Jets on July 21, 2006 as a Wide Receiver/Quarterback. In a preseason game in 2007, he was played at quarterback and rallied the Jets to 10 points and scrambled for the game-winning touchdown. He was then declared a \"bona fide quarterback\" by Jets coach Eric Mangini and was listed higher on the depth chart at quarterback than wide receiver. Through Week 5 of the 2007 season, the Jets used Smith in a variety of ways, lining him up at quarterback, running back, and wide receiver. He was also a standout on special teams. Smith scored his first career receiving touchdown on October 7, 2007, against the New York Giants.\n\nOn December 16, 2007, Smith substituted for starter Kellen Clemens who was injured in a game against the New England Patriots. Smith would then alternate with former starter Chad Pennington for the rest of the game, running an option and also attempting a pass. He is also a winner of the Jets' 2007 Kyle Clifton Good Guy Award, which recognizes consistent willingness, cooperation and professionalism in everyday dealings with various departments in organization.\n\nSmith was used in the Jets' wildcat formations. He had been injured (quad) throughout the beginning of the 2009 season, but emerged to become a leader of special teams, including being the starting kick returner. On December 13, 2009, Smith ran a fake punt play, in which he completed a pass to Eric Smith, having the longest completion of any team that day, the play went for 27 yards. On December 27, 2009, Smith returned the opening kickoff of the 2nd half for a 106-yard touchdown against the Indianapolis Colts. This is the longest play in New York Jets history, and tied for the second longest kickoff return in NFL history. In the last game of the 2009 regular season, Smith had 91 rushing yards, lining up at quarterback each time, having a 57-yard play, and scoring a 32-yard touchdown.\n\nDuring the 2010 season, Smith was mostly used as a wildcat specialist and return specialist. One of Smith's best games was on Thanksgiving of November 25, 2010 where he scored a 53-yard touchdown on a wildcat end-around and an 89-yard kickoff return touchdown in a Jets 26–10 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nSmith agreed to a four-year, $15 million contract with the Buffalo Bills on July 28, 2011. The Bills used him that season mostly out of wildcat formations, and they also used him as a wide receiver. During the 2012 season, Smith returned an 89-yard kick off for a touchdown in a loss vs. the Tennessee Titans.\n\nOn November 8, 2013, the Bills released Smith off of their injured-reserve list.\n\nSmith was signed by the Eagles on November 12, 2013.\n\nSmith and his wife Rosalynn have a son, Alex Smith and a daughter.\n\n"}

Also known as the bistro chair, it was designed by Michael Thonet and introduced in 1859, becoming the world's first mass-produced item of furniture. It is made using a unique steam-bending technology, known as bentwood, that required years to perfect. With its affordable price and simple design, it became one of the best-selling chairs ever made. Some 50 million No. 14s were sold between 1859 and 1930, and millions more have been sold since.\n\nThonet's No. 14 was made of six pieces of steam-bent wood, ten screws, and two nuts. The wooden parts were made by heating beechwood slats to , pressing them into curved cast-iron moulds, and then drying them at around for 20 hours. The chairs could be mass-produced by unskilled workers and disassembled to save space during transportation. \n\nLater chairs, as illustrated here, were made of eight pieces of wood: two diagonal braces were added between the seat and back, to strengthen this hard-worked joint.\n\nThe design was a response to a requirement for cafe-style chairs. The seat was often made of woven cane or palm, because the holes in the seat would let spilt liquid drain off the chair.\n\nChair No 14 is still produced by Gebrüder Thonet Vienna.

He began his career as a teacher at Ilford County High School between 1972 and 1974, from which post he resigned when he was elected to Redbridge London Borough Council (1974–78). From 1974 to 1981 he was also a marine insurance broker at Lloyd's, and he worked as a lecturer in management between 1997 and 2005.\n\nAt the 1979 general election he contested the Labour seat of Hackney South and Shoreditch where he came second to Ronald Brown.\n\nSir David was elected as the Conservative MP for Erith and Crayford at the 1983 general election when he defeated James Wellbeloved who had defected from the Labour Party to the newly formed Social Democrats in 1981. Sir David gained the seat with a majority of 920 votes over Wellbeloved. He remained the MP until the seat was redrawn in boundary changes at the 1997 general election.\n\nIn Parliament he joined the Education and Science Select committee in 1986.

{"id": "1872586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872586", "title": "22 Short Films About Springfield", "text": "22 Short Films About Springfield\n\n\"22 Short Films About Springfield\" is the twenty-first episode of \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> seventh season. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 14, 1996. It was written by Richard Appel, David S. Cohen, Jonathan Collier, Jennifer Crittenden, Greg Daniels, Brent Forrester, Dan Greaney, Rachel Pulido, Steve Tompkins, Josh Weinstein, Bill Oakley, and Matt Groening, with the writing being supervised by Daniels. The episode was directed by Jim Reardon. Phil Hartman guest starred as Lionel Hutz and the hospital board chairman.\n\nThe episode depicts brief incidents experienced by a wide array of Springfield residents in a series of interconnected stories that take place over a single day. The episode's concept originated from the end segment of the season four episode \"The Front\", and serves as a loose parody of \"Pulp Fiction\", which gave the staff the idea of a possible spin-off from \"The Simpsons\". The title is a reference to the film \"Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould\". \n\nThe episode received positive reviews from critics, and is noted for its popularity among fans.\n\nThe episode is a series of shorts ranging in length from under half a minute to over two and half minutes, each showing daily life in Springfield after Bart wonders if anything interesting happens to the town's citizens.\n\n\nThe episode's principal idea came from the season four episode \"The Front\", which contained a short sequence entitled \"The Adventures of Ned Flanders\", featuring its own title card and theme song, at its conclusion. The scene has no relevance to the main plot of the episode and was designed solely as filler to accommodate the episode's short runtime. The staff loved the concept and attempted to fit similar scenes into other episodes, but none were short enough to require one. Show runners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein decided to make an entire episode of linked short scenes involving many of the show's characters, in a similar style to Quentin Tarantino's \"Pulp Fiction\". The title \"22 Short Films About Springfield\" was decided upon from the start of the episode's production, even though there are not actually twenty-two stories in it. Originally there were more scenes, but several of them had to be cut out for time. To decide who would write each of the segments, all of the writers chose their top three favorite characters and put them into a hat, the names were drawn out and the writers were assigned their parts. Oakley wrote the Superintendent Chalmers story, Weinstein did the Comic Book Guy and Milhouse scene, David Cohen penned the Reverend Lovejoy sketch, as well as the deleted Krusty the Clown scene. Brent Forrester wrote the Krusty Burger scene, while Rachel Pulido wrote the Bumblebee Man one. Richard Appel wrote a deleted \"elaborate fantasy segment\" revolving around Marge, the only remnant of which is her cleaning the sink during the first Lisa scene, and also did a scene with Lionel Hutz that was dropped as well.\n\nThe episode's first draft was 65 pages long and needed to be cut down to just 42, so numerous scenes were cut for time or because they did not fit into the overall dynamic of the episode. To solve this problem, a scene before the second act break, where the townspeople go to the Simpson house to provide advice of how Lisa can get the gum out of her hair, was created to include every character that did not appear anywhere else during the course of the episode. Weinstein and writing supervisor Greg Daniels was responsible for ordering and linking together the episodes, and director Jim Reardon had the challenge of segueing between each section in a way that did not make the change seem abrupt. Those that were hard to link were put before or after an act break or were given a theme song, one of which was cut from the Apu story, but was included as a deleted scene on \"The Complete Seventh Season\" DVD.\n\nBill Oakley wrote the Chalmers scene because he is his all-time favorite character from the show. The main reason he loved him was that, until Frank Grimes was created for the season eight episode \"Homer's Enemy\", Chalmers was the only character that \"seemed to operate in the normal human universe\". In previous episodes, Skinner and Chalmers' scenes together revolved around one joke: Skinner tells Chalmers an unbelievable lie, but Chalmers believes him anyway. So, their scene in this episode is made up of a string of thirteen interconnected lies. The dialogue between him and Skinner was something that had never been done before, in that it is just a long relaxed conversation with nothing important being said at all.\n\nIn the Mr. Burns story, every single word he yells at Smithers is real and used correctly. To maintain accuracy, the writers used a 19th-century slang thesaurus to look up words. Many of the Spanish words used in Bumblebee Man's segment are easily understood cognates of English and not accurate Spanish; this was done deliberately so that non-Spanish speakers could understand the dialogue without subtitles. The very tall man was a caricature of writer Ian Maxtone-Graham, and the crowd on the street who laugh at Nelson includes caricatures of Matt Groening, Bill Oakley, and Josh Weinstein. Oakley wrote in the script that the street was filled with Springfield's biggest idiots and so the animators drew him, Weinstein, and Groening into the scene.\n\nThe episode contains numerous references to Quentin Tarantino's \"Pulp Fiction\". Like the film, the episode's plot is episodic, though the stories are interconnected. The policemen's conversation about McDonald's parallels the famous \"Royale With Cheese\" discussion, and the music played during the segment's beginning was also taken from the film. The story involving Chief Wiggum and Snake is a direct parody of the \"Gold Watch\" segment of the film. Snake runs over Wiggum at a red light, alluding to the segment of the film where the character of Butch Coolidge did the same to Marsellus Wallace, before crashing into a fire hydrant and beginning an on-foot chase. The two run into Herman's Military Antique shop, where Herman beats, ties up and gags the two, then waits for \"Zed\" to arrive, exactly as Maynard does in \"Pulp Fiction\". The writers were pleased that Herman already existed as otherwise they would have had to create another character just for this scene. The episode's title is a reference to the film \"Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould\".\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"22 Short Films About Springfield\" finished tied for 73rd in the weekly ratings for the week of April 8–14, 1996, with a Nielsen rating of 6.9. It was the seventh highest rated show from the Fox network that week. \n\nOn March 12, 2002, the episode was released in the United States on a DVD collection titled \"The Simpsons Film Festival\", along with the season eleven episode \"Beyond Blunderdome\", the season four episode \"\", and the season six episode \"A Star is Burns\".\n\nThe episode is Bill Oakley's personal favorite episode, but it is hated by two prominent figures within the running of the show. When \"The Simpsons\" began streaming on Disney+ in 2019, Oakley named this one of the best classic Simpsons episodes to watch on the service. The episode is frequently cited as a popular one amongst the show's fans on the Internet. \n\nIn 1998, \"TV Guide\" listed it in its list of top twelve \"Simpsons\" episodes. \n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\", in 2003, placed the episode 14th on their top 25 \"The Simpsons\" episode list, praising the episode's structure and finding the \"Pulp Fiction\" references \"priceless\". \n\nWarren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", called it \"an untypical episode, and a very good one\", naming the Skinner and Chalmers story as the best.\n\nIn 2019 several sources cited the episode as one of the show's best, including \"Consequence of Sound\" who ranked it number five on its' list of top 30 \"Simpsons\" episodes, \n\nEntertainment.ie who named it among the 10 greatest \"Simpsons\" episodes of all time, \n\n\"The Guardian\" who named it one of the five greatest episodes in \"Simpsons\" history and while IGN named \"A Fish Called Selma\" the best episode of the seventh season, they added that \"22 Short Films About Springfield\" was \"good competition\" for the crown.\n\nIn 2004, \"Empire\" named the episode's \"Pulp Fiction\" parody the seventh best film gag in the show, calling Wiggum and Snake bound and gagged with red balls in their mouths \"the sickest visual gag in \"Simpsons\" history\". The episode is the favorite of British comedian Jimmy Carr who, in 2003, called it \"a brilliant pastiche of art cinema\".\n\nThe episode sparked the idea amongst the staff for a spin-off series entitled \"Springfield Stories\" or simply \"Springfield\". The proposed show would focus on the town in general, rather than the Simpson family. Every week would be a different scenario, such as three short stories, an adventure with young Homer, or a story about a background character that was not tied into the Simpson family at all. The idea never resulted in anything, as Groening realized that the staff did not have the manpower to produce another show as well as \"The Simpsons\". By 2006, the staff maintained that it was something that they would still be interested in doing, and by 2007 that it \"could happen someday.\" \"22 Short Films About Springfield\" also helped inspire the \"Futurama\" episode \"Three Hundred Big Boys\".\n\nIn one segment of the episode, titled \"Skinner & The Superintendent\", Seymour Skinner invents the term \"steamed hams\" to refer to hamburgers, claiming that it is an expression in the regional dialect of Albany, New York. Starting in late 2016, over two decades from the episode's premiere, the scene gained renewed popularity in Facebook groups and pages relating to \"The Simpsons\". It has also spawned numerous parody and remix videos on YouTube, many of them featuring \"Steamed Hams But\" in their titles, including some videos from an original Seattle-Tacoma's FOX affiliate KCPQ airing.\n\nIn 2016, Australian supermarket chain Woolworths noted that \"about 1000 people\" commented on its Facebook page inquiring about \"steamed hams\". The company responded to these requests by posting an image of hams with the caption, \"We've received a lot of feedback from you all in the last 24 hours about whether we stock 'Steamed Hams'. Please note that in Australia, we call them Hamburgers. 'Steamed Hams' is an Albany, New York expression. Fans of \"The Simpsons\", this is for you\". The continuing popularity of the segment with Skinner and Superintendent Chalmers also caused an upsurge in fan-made YouTube remixes and variants in November 2017 and afterward. In January 2018, Bill Oakley, original writer of the segment posted the original draft for the segment on Twitter.\n\nIn April 2018, a reporter for Gamespot, during an interview with actor Jeff Goldblum for the film \"\", had Goldblum read the part of Skinner in a recreation of the scene. Goldblum commented at the end of the read, \"I like the writing, too—that was from what?\" Oakley responded immediately on Twitter, writing \"[I'm] not a fan of fairly big companies like Gamespot having famous actors perform scripts I wrote, verbatim, without giving me any sort of credit whatsoever.\" The video was taken down within days of its posting.\n\n"}
{"id": "1872591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872591", "title": "Bat Ayin", "text": "Bat Ayin\n\nBat Ayin (, lit., \"daughter of the eye\" or \"apple of the eye\", i. e., pupil) is an Israeli settlement in Gush Etzion in the West Bank, between Jerusalem and Hebron. It is administered by the Gush Etzion Regional Council, and contains roughly 200 families of settlers, consisting mainly of \"Ba'alei T'shuva\" (back to the faith) Jews with Hasidic tendencies. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli and US governments dispute this.\n\nAccording to ARIJ, Israel confiscated land from 2 neighbouring Palestinian villages in order to construct Bat Ayin; 144 dunams from Khirbet Beit Zakariyyah in addition to land taken from Jab'a.\n\nBat Ayin was established by seven families led by Rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburg in 1989, on land originally purchased by Jews before 1948, which, under Jordanian rule until 1967, was treated as \"enemy property\". Eventually, large lots of land were allocated to some 40 families. People of the settlement did not come from the settler mainstream establishment. Many of the original settlers were raised on the \"hills\". It gained a reputation for being particularly extremist and very callous towards local Palestinians, none of whom were allowed to pass anywhere near the settlement. In the early 2000s general elections, half of Bat Ayin voters expressed a preference for the Herut candidate Baruch Marzel. In 1993, Motti Karpel and Chaim Nativ set up the \"Chai Vekayam\" (Alive and Well) movement in Bat Ayin, whose document, \"Identity Card\", stated clearly that the laws of the state of Israeli are not binding on West Bank settlers. According to one resident, in an extensive interview, Israel is only for Jews, who are a \"chosen people\", and Palestinians are required to serve them, according to the Torah's words: \"People will work for you, nations will bow for you.\" The settlement is said to have expansionist interests, having established an illegal outpost called West-West Bat Ayin.\n\nBat Ayin residents have been suspected of numerous acts of terror, aside from attacking Arabs: These include plots to attack Israeli politicians, and plans to blow up mosques, including those on the Temple Mount. Though arrests have been made, all suspects have been released for want of evidence.\nA terrorist movement based in Bat Ayin, later known as the Bat Ayin Underground, was founded on the belief, shared by extremist settlers, that the Israeli government was acting against the interests of the Jewish people. The group's agenda has been seen as \"isolationist\" in its hostility to secular Israeli society and commitment to the Torah. The notion of forming such a group apparently arose in late 1998, as a result of a conversation between two eighteen-year-olds - Shahar Dvir-Zeliger, who hailed from the Adei Ad farm, and Sela Tor, who alternated between Hebron and the Maon Farm founded by his brother Yehoshafat. The Maon Farm provided several recruits, as did the Jewish settlement in Hebron. They eventually recruited Shahar's brother Shlomo, Yarden Morag, and Ofer Gamliel, whose engineering background in the IDF was to prove useful in making a bomb. In early 2001, they began to engage in drive-by shootings of Palestine cars at nighttime on minor roadways, spraying them with fire from automatic weapons, and the planting of bombs in public buildings. Their most notable success was an ambush of a Palestinian Mercedes truck near Ramallah and Kokhav HaShahar, killing its two occupants, one a twenty-year-old man. Cell members claimed responsibility through a group called \"Tears of the Widows and the Orphans\". Overall, the group, once arrested, admitted to seven attacks of this nature, which claimed eight Palestinian lives and sixteen wounded.\n\nOn 17 September 2001, the network planted two bombs in a Palestinian schoolyard at Yatta: One was timed to explode during the recess, and a second bomb several minutes later, in the expectation that teachers and students would be drawn to examine the damage. A malfunction caused the first bomb to explode earlier, and Israeli sappers managed to defuse the second bomb in time.\n\nIn a second operation on 5 March 2002, the Bat Ayin group, retaliating for a Hamas suicide bombing at Beit Yisrael, planted a bomb in a pink ice cream carton at a Palestinian boys school in Sur Baher. Children noticed it, covered it with pillows, and informed their principal who called the police, but it exploded before they arrived, and ten of the boys were slightly injured.\n\nIn an operation undertaken on the night of April 29, 2002, Yarden Morag and Shlomo Dvir drove a vehicle with a trailer to East Jerusalem. They were initially stopped near the Beit Orot Yeshiva by Mount Scopus, because it was irregular for Jews with skullcaps to drive in Palestinian areas of East Jerusalem, at night. They were not detained, since police accepted their excuse that they were on their way to a yeshiva. The same police officers, Shimon Cohen and Barak Segev, later sighted the same vehicle near a girls' school, close by the Al-Makassad hospital in the At-Tur neighbourhood. The officers stopped the two and examined the car, finding that the trailer had two containers of gasoline rigged to two TNT bricks, and propane gas tanks. The explosive charge consisted of a \"vergin\" (military battery), and the device, in a baby carriage, was timed to explode at 7:35 am., when dozens of girls would have been entering the schoolgrounds. Later investigations revealed this was not a one-off strike, but rather, part of a West Bank network of settlers conducting a campaign against Palestinians. Israeli intelligence soon heard of a large cache of weapons, and suspected it might imply an attack on the Temple Mount was being prepared.\nEventually, 6 men, residents of Bat Ayin and Hebron, were convicted, while other led members were charged with minor felonies or not put on trial. Efforts to discover the weapons catch and convict members of the wider network, who had connections to the Kach terrorist group, failed, according to Daniel Byman, because they had learnt the lessons of the group's manual on how to confront a Shin Bet interrogation. Shlomo Dvir and Ofer Gamliel received 15-year sentences, Morag twelve years, and Shahar Dvir eight years. Three of the men were convicted of attempted murder. Ofer Gamliel was released from prison two years early in 2015, although the Shin Bet had repeatedly protested any early release for him.\n\nOn February 25, 2007, Erez Levanon, a resident of Bat Ayin, was found killed by multiple stab wounds. His body was found down the hill from the settlement in a secluded location where he frequently prayed. Two teenagers from Khirbet Safa confessed to the murder.\n\nOn April 2, 2009, an Arab wielding an ax entered Bat Ayin and murdered Shlomo Nativ, aged 13. A 7-year-old child was also wounded. The attacker was arrested a few weeks later by Israel's security services.\n\nIn a stone-throwing incident on April 8, 2009 involving Bat Ayin and Khirbet Safa residents, sixteen Palestinians were injured, one critically, when the IDF opened fire.\n\nOn May 2, 2009, two off-duty Israeli Defense Forces soldiers and two residents of Bat Ayin were arrested in a rock-throwing incident in which two Khirbet Safa villagers were injured.\n\nIn another clash on January 28, 2011, Yousef Ikhlayl, age 17, of Khirbet Safa was shot in the head, and died in a hospital in Beit Jala.\n\nOn August 16, 2012, a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a taxi occupied by six members of a Palestinian family as it passed by Bat Ayin. The taxi caught fire, and the passengers were treated for burns at Hadassah Medical Center, Ein Karem. Three boys, aged 12–13, studying at a yeshiva in Bat Ayin were arrested as suspects. The attack was condemned by the rabbi of Bat Ayin, who saw it as an example of \"moral degeneration\". Internal Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch, on learning of the children's arrest, claimed that there were concentrations of extreme rightists in Bat Ayin. He also added that he was \"confident that the police, IDF, and the Shin Bet will do their job, which is not simple, because we know who we are dealing with\". The three minors were subsequently released under house arrest.\n\nIn late October 2013, masked settlers beat with a bat a Palestinian truck driver carrying goods ordered by the settlement and assaulted two IDF soldiers. The IDF responded by suspending assistance to Bat Ayin's defense.\n\nIn March 2015, residents of Bat Ayin had an altercation with the IDF and police. Law enforcement representatives went to the settlement to arrest two residents for allegedly committing \"nationalist crimes\". Bat Ayin is known for its \"extremist ideology\", and the police were blocked by about 20 youths throwing stones. Authorities called for reinforcements, and law enforcement was able to leave with the suspects. Residents of Bat Ayin accused the police and IDF of provoking the incident.\n\nIn April 2015, Elad Yaakov Sela (25) from Bat Ayin, a corporal serving as an intelligence NCO in the Etzion Brigade, was indicted for espionage and leaking confidential information to extreme right-wing members of the community, to tip them off about forthcoming arrests in the wake of a price tag attack on a nearby mosque. He was sentenced to 3 years and 9 months imprisonment after being convicted of the charges, in January 2016.\n\nIn 2013, there were about 200 families, many of them residing as tenants, in Bat Ayin. The majority of the residents are religious-Zionist and Chardal Jews who adhere to a philosophy that combines spiritual religious life with organic agriculture, with Hasidic Breslov the predominate affiliation. Social norms are rigid, and some young people tend to leave.\nBat Ayin Orthodoxy is popularly known as \"Chavakuk\" (Hebrew, חבקו\"ק), an acronym for Chabad, Breslov, (Rabbi Abraham Isaac) Kook, and (Shlomo) Carlebach. There is a Chabad Lubavitch community, as well. The Bat Ayin community includes doctors, builders, plumbers, electricians, and psychologists.\n\nThe area around Bat Ayin is rich in natural springs, (Heb. \"ma'ayanot\"), and one is used as a mikvah. There is also an ancient mikvah from the times of the second Temple that is not in use. According to OCHA collected testimonies, settlers from Bat Ayin began planting trees in the area of the Ein al-Sijme spring, on Palestinian land leased to the Thawabta family, in the late 1990s. Due to harassment, the family was forced to abandon its vineyards and orchards, and the area remains uncultivated.\nThere are remains of an ancient Jewish village and a miqwah called khribet helal at the entrance to the village.\n\nThe Bat Ayin Yeshiva is an institution of advanced Jewish learning for men offering two main programs: a Beit Midrash study program and a Smicha program for rabbinical ordination. Midreshet B'erot Bat Ayin offers women's programs, a conversion program, and seminars.\n\nThe rabbi of Bat Ayin is Daniel Kohn, who holds a BA in comparative religion from Columbia University and received rabbinic ordination from the Chief Rabbinate of Israel. He co-founded the Bat Ayin Yeshiva, and served as co-Rosh Yeshiva for nine years.\n\n"}

Conservative, Maria Caulfield, was elected as Member of Parliament for Lewes in May 2015 replacing Liberal Democrat Norman Baker who had been MP since 1997.\n\nFor European Parliamentary elections, Glynde and Beddingham is in the South East England European Constituency which is represented by ten Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). The June 2014 election returned four United Kingdom Independence Party, three Conservative Party, one Liberal Democrat Party, One Green Party, and one Labour Party MEPs.\n\nThere are five Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) within the parish. Firle Escarpment, which extends into the neighbouring parish of Firle. Another site, completely within the parish is Asham Quarry which is of geological interest due to its stratigraphy of Devensian and Flandrian deposits.\n\nSoutherham Grey Pit and Southerham Machine Bottom Pit are two more SSSIs of geological interest within the parish. These sites are disused chalk pits which display a wide variety of fossilised fish remains. The final SSSI is Lewes Downs, a site of biological interest, which is an isolated area of the South Downs.\n\nWithin the parish, overlooking the village of Glynde, is Mount Caburn, a 480 foot (146 m) isolated peak on top of which sits an Iron Age hill fort.\n"}

According to a brief, unpublished autobiographical account, while still a child she moved to Oxford County, Upper Canada, where eventually she worked as a district school teacher for a few years. She entered Albion College (Albion, Mich.) in 1855, from which she received an msa degree the following year and where she subsequently taught for three years. In 1860 she was invited by the Reverend Robert Alexander Fyfe*, the first principal of the Canadian Literary Institute, a Baptist school in Woodstock, to teach art, literature, and English. She accepted the invitation and taught there until 1866, when marriage to a student of hers necessitated her resignation. The couple began married life in Brantford, where James Yule ran a private grammar school, and then, after 1 Oct. 1868, lived in York Mills (Toronto), where he was pastor of York Mills Baptist Church. In 1874, after James accepted a professorship in New Testament studies at the Canadian Literary Institute, they returned to Woodstock. Following her husband's death from tuberculosis on 28 Jan. 1876, Yule lived in Brantford and then in Ingersoll. She remained active in the church, particularly concerning foreign missions, and reports and articles by her appeared regularly in the Canadian Missionary Link (Toronto) between 1886 and 1889.\n\nYule contributed poems extensively to journals and newspapers in both Canada and the United States from about 1856. Her earliest appearance in an anthology seems to have been the three poems which William Turner Coggeshall included in \"The poets and poetry of the West\" (New York, 1860). The appearance of eight of her poems in Edward Hartley Dewart*’s Selections from Canadian poets, which was published in Montreal by John Lovell in 1864, brought her work before a larger Canadian public, and Dewart’s enthusiasm for her poetry (“There is no Canadian poet whose poetry we have read, and re-read, with greater interest and delight than Miss Vining’s”) helped to establish her reputation. Her earliest separate publication was The names of Jesus; a poem, originally read at the Canadian Literary Institute on 27 Jan. 1866. A more substantial work, Poems of the heart and home, appeared in Toronto in 1881. Some time after her marriage she began to write fiction. Ada Emory; or, the sister's Bible; a story and Up hill; or Paul Sutherland's progress (1887) were issued in Philadelphia by the American Baptist Publication Society. No copy of Ada Emory has been located; that it was published in 1871 is confirmed in the autobiographical note; advertisements for it appeared in Canadian Baptist between 1873 and 1876. The only recorded copy of the second novel, the one deposited at the Library of Congress, was at some later point discarded. Sowing and reaping: or, records of the Ellisson family, a temperance novel, was published in Toronto by William Briggs* in 1889 (not 1899, as is usually stated). She also edited the papers of her husband and published them, together with her memoir of him, as Records of a vanished life . . . (Toronto, 1876). In addition to her poetry and fiction she published on religious subjects, contributing, for example, a series of Sunday school lessons to The Christian helper (Toronto) in the early 1880s. A number of unpublished manuscripts remain among her papers at the Canadian Baptist Archives, including “The Heathen World,” a substantial non-fiction work that deals with the church's obligation to carry the gospel to the heathen. Excerpts were published in the Canadian Missionary Link between 1886 and 1888.\n\nThough praised by Dewart and of sufficient repute in her day to be included in Archibald MacMurchy's Handbook of Canadian literature (English) (Toronto, 1906), Yule's writing may strike the contemporary reader as somewhat artificial and didactic. Her work reflects the typical feelings and standards of Victorian Canada in matters ranging from nature to temperance, and all of her books are dominated by an entirely unreluctant Christianity expressed in a style modelled largely on Tennyson and Longfellow.\n\n"}

During a Parliamentary career spanning 14 years, she held a number of ministerial and shadow ministerial roles, including Deputy Leader of the House of Commons, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State in the Department for Work and Pensions until 2010 with responsibility for child poverty and childcare and shadow Minister for the Americas and the Far East.\n\nGoodman's mother was a Danish immigrant and her father was an architect. Born in Nottingham, she grew up in Derbyshire and was educated at her village school and Lady Manners School, Bakewell, Derbyshire, which at the time was a Grammar School. She studied PPE at Somerville College, Oxford.\n\nUpon graduating from the University of Oxford, she worked as a researcher for the Labour MP Phillip Whitehead. She worked in HM Treasury as a fast stream administrator holding many posts including on the Energy Desk, the Exchange Rate Desk, Central Budget Unit, Overseas Finance. In 1990–91, she was seconded to the Office of the Czechoslovak Prime Minister to advise on their economic transition after the Velvet Revolution.\n\nIn 1992, she negotiated an agreement within the OECD to end government subsidies on arms exports to highly indebted countries. This was in the wake of the Scott inquiry into the first Iraq war.\n\nGoodman also oversaw the establishment of the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme in 1990, the first major Government programme to tackle energy efficiency and fuel poverty.\n\nFrom 1997, she was the director of the Commission on the Future for MultiEthnic Britain (sponsored by the Runnymede Trust). She was appointed the Head of Strategy at The Children's Society in 1998, where she was involved in lobbying on policies to cut child poverty. From 2002 until her election to the House of Commons, she was Chief Executive of the National Association of Toy and Leisure Libraries which supported 1,000 projects across Great Britain. She is a member of the GMB Union and the Christian Socialist Movement, Amnesty International and Friends of the Earth. She has published numerous articles including in the \"Political Quarterly\" and \"Foreign Policy Centre.\"\n\nGoodman was selected as the Labour Party candidate for the County Durham seat of Bishop Auckland at the 2005 general election through an All-Women Shortlist, following the retirement of the veteran Labour MP Derek Foster. Goodman held the seat with a majority of 10,047 votes and made her maiden speech in the Commons on 25 May 2005. She was re-elected in 2010, 2015 and 2017.\n\nShe was a member of the Public Accounts Committee from May 2005 to April 2007 before becoming a Parliamentary Private Secretary at the Ministry of Justice. In June 2007, she was appointed Deputy Leader of the House of Commons, before being made a whip in October 2008. She left this role in June 2009 to become a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Work and Pensions. In this role, she steered the Child Poverty Act onto the statute book, alongside Stephen Timms.\n\nAfter the 2010 general election, Goodman nominated Ed Miliband for the leadership of the Labour Party. After his election as party leader, she was appointed as opposition spokesman in Labour's Justice team with special responsibility for Prisons and Sentencing policy. In October 2011, she became Shadow Minister for Media. In this role she has campaigned for better child protection online. In October 2013, she was also given responsibility for Labour's Arts policy.\n\nIn 2010, she ran a successful campaign in conjunction with \"The Northern Echo\" to save the Zurbarán paintings at Auckland Castle when the Commissioners of the Church of England threatened to sell them. In February 2013, appalled at the impact of the \"bedroom tax\" on her constituents, she tried to live for a week on £18.\n\nIn 2011, Helen led Labour's response to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill. \n\nOn 3 December 2014, she became Shadow Minister for Welfare Reform as part of a small Shadow Cabinet reshuffle by Ed Miliband. Since February 2016, Goodman has also served as a member of the Advisory Board at \"Polar Research and Policy Initiative\".\n\nFrom 9 June 2016 to 12 June 2016 she attended the 64th annual Bilderberg Conference in Dresden, Germany.\n\nGoodman supported Remain in the June 2016 EU referendum campaign, and during the December 2019 General Election was endorsed by the People's Vote Campaign.\n\nIn 2017, she took part in a campaign to save the DWP office in Bishop Auckland from closure. She raised questions in Parliament regarding the proposed office closure and took part in a match and Rally opposing the closure on 18 March 2017 \n\nIn July 2017, Goodman was appointed as a junior spokesperson for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs under Shadow Foreign Secretary, Emily Thornberry, with responsibility for the Americas and the Far East. In May 2018, she successfully led Labour's attempt to secure Magnitsky Clauses in the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill during its Committee Stage and was instrumental in a cross-party initiative that secured an amendment to the Bill requiring public registers of beneficial ownership in the Overseas Territories. Other work included developing Labour's policy on the crisis in Hong Kong in 2019, visiting Colombia in May 2019 to meet various stakeholders involved in the implementation of Colombia's faltering peace process and frequently pressing the UK Government to act on a number of human rights issues including the treatment of the Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang, the Rohingya refugee crisis and the rights of West Papuans. \n\nAlongside veteran MP Ken Clarke, Goodman first developed the concept of holding indicative votes in Parliament to resolve the Brexit deadlock. In March 2019, during the indicative votes held by MPs to decide which version of Brexit that they supported, Goodman again worked closely with Ken Clarke to secure support for the option to remain with the EU Customs Union. The Customs Union option came closest to securing an overall majority out of all the other options, falling three votes short.\n\nIn October 2019, Goodman was again selected by her local party as Bishop Auckland constituency's Parliamentary Labour candidate. During the December 2019 General Election, Bishop Auckland was one of the 59 constituencies lost by the Labour Party.\n\nIn May 2009, \"The Daily Telegraph\" revealed that Goodman had claimed £519.31 for use of a cottage in her own constituency on her expenses, and had submitted hotel bills dated two months prior to being elected to the House of Commons. Goodman argued that she was carrying out Parliamentary business when using the cottage and thus her claim was accepted, and the claim for the hotel stay – which was rejected – was a mistake.\n\nShe also claimed a £600 fee for advice from her management consultant husband.\nGoodman pointed out that the independent inquiry by Thomas Legg into MPs expenses had given her \"an entirely clean bill of health and concluded that none of my claims required further explanation or clarification.”\n\nIn June 2014, Goodman was invited to give a speech at the opening of a village fayre at Ingleton, County Durham, in the parliamentary constituency which she had represented for nine years.\n\nDuring her speech, she praised the village for the beauty of its waterfalls and caves and for its connection with the author, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. None of these features applied to the County Durham village, but were, in fact, references to the village of Ingleton, situated seventy miles away in North Yorkshire. The speech reportedly \"baffled\" the audience and after five minutes she was called away from the microphone and informed of her mistake.\n\nIn October 2015, Goodman attracted criticism from fellow MPs over a tweet mentioning Jeremy Hunt's wife. Hunt had mentioned his wife in a speech on Asian economies' work culture, and Goodman's tweet asked: \"If China is so great, why did Jeremy Hunt's wife come to England?\". The Labour Party issued a statement saying that Goodman's tweet \"did not represent its views\" and Labour's Shadow Leader of the House of Lords Lady Smith said Goodman's tweet was \"absolutely bizarre\". Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said it was a \"terrible tweet\" and called for Goodman to apologise. She later deleted the tweet and issued an apology.\n\nGoodman is married to Charles Seaford, a Senior Fellow at Demos. The couple have two children.\n\n"}

There is evidence of this ritual from the Old Kingdom to the Roman Period. Special tools were used to perform the ceremony, such as a ritual adze, an arm shaped ritual censer, a spooned blade known as a \"peseshkaf\", a serpent-head blade, and a variety of other amulets. A calf's leg was also held up to the lips painted on the coffin.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians believed that in order for a person's soul to survive in the afterlife it would need to have food and water. The opening of the mouth ritual was thus performed so that the person who died could eat and drink again in the afterlife. \n\nThe ceremony involved up to 75 \"episodes\" and, in its most complete version, included the following stages:\n\nThe \"Book of the Dead\" also contains a spell for this process, which the deceased may use on themselves:\nTranslating literally as \"opening of the mouth,\" the Egyptian terms for the ritual are \"wpt-r\" and \"um-r.\" According to Ann Macy Roth, the verb \"wpi\" connotes an opening that splits, divides or separates: \"it can be used, for example, to describe the separation of two combatants, the dividing of time, or even an analysis or determination of the truth.\"\n\nParallels between the Opening of the Mouth and Psalm 51 have been noted.

Its closest relatives are the Chilean pigeon and the ring-tailed pigeon, which form a clade of \"Patagioenas\" with a terminal tail band and iridescent plumage on their necks. There are at least 8 sub-species, and some authorities split this species into the northern band-tailed pigeon (\"Patagioenas fasciata\") and the southern band-tailed pigeon (\"Patagioenas albilinea\").\n\nIt ranges from British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California, and southern Arizona south in higher elevations through Mexico and Central America to northern Argentina. In autumn it migrates out of its permanent resident range into northern California, New Mexico, and parts of Utah and Colorado. It is found from almost sea level to , generally in oak, pine-oak, and coniferous forests. It feeds on seeds, notably acorns, as well as berries and small fruits.\n\nIt is the biggest pigeon in North America, measuring long and weighing . The coastal subspecies \"P. f. monilis\" (averaging ) is larger than the inland subspecies (averaging ). The plumage is gray, somewhat darker above. The head and underparts have a faint pink cast, especially in the adult male; the belly is nearly white. The distal half of the tail is also pale (except in the subspecies of Baja California), whence the English name. The bill and feet are yellow, good identification marks at sufficiently close range. Adults have green iridescence on the back of the neck, adjacent to a thin white collar on the nape. Juvenile birds have white feather edges above, giving a scaly appearance.\n\nThis species is relatively quiet for a pigeon. Its voice is low-pitched and owl-like, often in two-syllable calls that rise and then fall (\"huu-ooh\") with even spacing between calls. It also makes a variety of harsh squawking sounds for a variety of reasons.\n\nIt builds a rudimentary platform nest out of twigs, in which it lays one or two eggs. Outside the breeding season it forms flocks, sometimes over 50 birds, and often becomes nomadic, following the acorn crop or moving to lower altitudes or other areas outside its breeding range. They commonly congregate at and drink from mineral springs, although it is not fully understood why. In addition to acorns and other seeds, the band-tailed pigeon will seasonally consume fruits such as Pacific madrona and Toyon berries. This species often visits bird feeders.\n\nThe parasitic louse \"Columbicola extinctus\", believed to have become extinct with the extinction of the passenger pigeon, was recently rediscovered on the band-tailed pigeon. The band-tailed pigeon is the closest genetic relative of the passenger pigeon and has been investigated for being used in efforts to bring back that extinct species.\n\n"}

Prior to managing the resort, Loyless, a native of west Georgia, served as a newspaper reporter, editor and publisher at papers in Augusta, Columbus and Macon.\n\nAs a young editor Loyless earned a reputation for bluntness and a fiery temper that did not always limit itself to print. An 1897 dispute with H.C. Hanson, editor of the rival \"Macon Morning Telegraph\" (later merged with \"Macon Evening News\" to form the \"Macon Telegraph\") in which Loyless accused Hanson of bias in reporting became so heated that when meeting Hanson in person Loyless struck him. Hanson in turn drew a handgun.\n\nBy 1915 Loyless was editor of the \"Augusta Chronicle\". He was one of the few newspaper editors in Georgia to proclaim the innocence of Leo Frank and denounced his prosecutors as corrupt. Though he continued to edit the paper until 1920, his editorials about Frank cost him his local popularity and made him an enemy of the Ku Klux Klan. Soon after his departure from the \"Chronicle\", he became the manager of the Warm Springs resort.\n\nLoyless proved an ambitious caretaker of the much-in-disrepair property. After a young man suffering from polio discovered that the springs helped him, Loyless and Warm Springs attracted the attention of Franklin D.

He is the author of various articles on the war in Syria, Brexit, US politics and homelessness.\n\nIn April 2016, Newmark was made President of the new Braintree District Community Foundation, an organisation led by local people supporting community projects.\n\nHe has authored a report on homelessness at the Centre for Social Justice. The report was for a think-tank and it highlighted the long-term nature of homelessness and also that homelessness has become normalised.\n\nNewmark's special interests include: Economic Policy, Foreign Affairs (Middle East, India, China and USA); Poverty Reduction & International Development (Micro Finance), Special Needs Education and Women & Equality (Founder and Co-Chairman of Women2Win). Many female candidates in the 2015 general election were subsequently successful in their bid to become MPs.\n\nPublications include: \"Direct Democracy: An Agenda for a New Model Party\" (2005); \"Simply Red; The True State of the Public Finances\" (CPS, 2006); \"The Price of Irresponsibility\" (CPS, 2008) and the \"Hidden Debt Bombshell\" (CPS, 2009).\n\nNewmark is involved with charity work in Rwanda and also helps homeless charities.\n\nIn 2009 Newmark co-founded the charity \"A Partner in Education\", which helps Rwandan teachers to give the nation's children an improved education. It supports training for teachers and provides an inclusive environment for children. The charity has built a school in Rwanda that caters for over 300 children.\n\nHe has volunteered for the Braintree Salvation Army and the homeless charity Crisis in London. His report for the Centre for Social Justice think-tank on rough sleeping highlighted the growth of ‘tent cities’ and the normalisation of rough sleeping.\n\nHe is married to Lucy Keegan, daughter of the military historian Sir John Keegan, and has four sons - Benjamin, Sam, Max and Zachary - and one daughter, Lily.\n\nNewmark is involved in various charities including PARC, a respite centre based in Braintree for Children with severe disabilities, Farleigh Hospice and A Partner in Education, which he founded in 2010.\n\n"}

Two trains terminate here every hour on a normal weekday timetabled service running to and from Brighton.\n\nHistorically, the station was planned to be the southern terminus of a new line running from the Midlands to the South Coast, and delivering holidaymakers to the new town of West Worthing; it was consequently built near the northern end of Grand Avenue, which runs from the station to the sea. The line was never constructed.\n\nThe station was built by J.T. Firbank and opened on 4 November 1889. It was expanded by the addition of a large goods yard in 1905 which catered for the produce of the large number of market gardens in the area, but by 1932 part of the yard was given over to the carriage sheds which, until mid-2008, stood to the west of the station.\n\nIn January 2008 demolition of the former depot building began. The building was removed because of asbestos and poor condition of the structure.\n\nThe station and all trains serving it are run by Southern but during peak times a few Thameslink trains to Littlehampton in the south, Haywards Heath and Bedford to the north and call here with the typical off-peak service consisting of the following:\n\n°=Thameslink\n\n"}

The series' primary focus is on the effect of advances in science and technology on western society in its philosophical aspects.\n\nThe title comes from the philosophical idea that the universe essentially only exists as one perceives it through what one knows; therefore, if one changes one's perception of the universe with new knowledge, one has essentially changed the universe itself. To illustrate this concept, James Burke tells the various stories of important scientific discoveries and technological advances and how they fundamentally altered how western civilization perceives the world. The series runs in roughly chronological order, from around the beginning of the Middle Ages to the present.\n\nIn the United States, the ten-week hour-long series was broadcast from 13 October to 15 December 1986, on PBS and was rebroadcast on The Learning Channel in 1993.\n\nA 1985 companion book was published with the same title, also written by Burke, presenting the same general premise of the television series in expanded detail. Burke read from the book for an abridged audiocassette and compact disc set available from Macmillan Audio.\n\n1. \"The Way We Are: It Started with the Greeks\"<br>\n2. \"In the Light of the Above: Medieval Conflict - Faith & Reason\"\n3. \"Point of View: Scientific Imagination in the Renaissance\"\n4. \"A Matter of Fact: Printing Transforms Knowledge\"\n5. \"Infinitely Reasonable: Science Revises the Heavens\"\n6. \"Credit Where It's Due: The Factory & Marketplace Revolution\"\n7. \"What the Doctor Ordered: Social Impacts of New Medical Knowledge\"\n8. \"Fit to Rule: Darwin's Revolution\"\n9. \"Making Waves: The New Physics - Newton Revised\"\n10. \"Worlds Without End: Changing Knowledge, Changing Reality\"\n\nLicensed by the BBC, \"The Day the Universe Changed\" was released on DVD in January 2009 by Documentary-Video. The five-disc set is closed captioned for the hearing impaired and approximately 550 minutes in length.\n\nAlfred Unger of \"The Christian Science Monitor\" (14 October 1986) said \"\"The Day the Universe Changed\" is studded with flashes of insight amid its potpourri of intellectual revelations. Burke believes that it will encourage viewers to examine what they know, digest what he has to tell them, and come up with, possibly, a new way of looking at things.\"\n\nJohn Corry of \"The New York Times\" (16 October 1986) called it \"[t]elevision on a grand scale. Mr. Burke is interested in ideas, and they bubble and perk throughout. Sometimes we'll get lost, but most likely we'll stay interested. This is provocative stuff.\"\n\nDiana Simmonds of the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" (6 August 1988) said, \"James Burke could have the answer. Maddeningly, he has the answer to most things and has had for years. This year he's being dazzling in \"The Day The Universe Changed\" (SBS). This series, in which he verbally dances through the earth-shattering events in history is, quite simply, exciting. Like an intravenous slug of ice-cold Akvavit, he provokes shivers of shock and pleasure. His mix of cleverness, egotism, fun, imagination and accessibility is similar to the television styles of Robert Hughes or J.K.Galbraith, except that Burke is also naughty — like a mischievous elf.\"\n\nWhilst Carl Davis composed the main title theme and some incidental music, the series itself made extensive use of brief extracts from classical music, including:\n"}

It closed after the death of its owner.\n\nThe railroad ran from Wilton to Greenfield, New Hampshire, using a state-owned rail line that was once part of the Boston and Maine Railroad's Hillsboro Branch. The line is still in limited commercial use, but has not been used for regular passenger service since the 1930s.\n\nThe railroad opened May 17, 2003, running from Wilton to the former Boston & Maine Railroad railyard in Greenfield, covering the entire route of the Peterboro Railroad which built the line from Wilton to Greenfield in the 1860s. Passengers were allowed to get off and stretch their legs in Greenfield before getting back on the train and heading back to Wilton. On August 23, 2003, the railroad began running almost a mile north of Greenfield to Greenfield State Park.\n\nThe Wilton Scenic Railroad had many plans before it ended service in 2006. One was to use the former B&M freight depot in Wilton, built in 1860, as the Wilton Scenic Railroad's depot. Stuart Draper owned the building as a storage unit for his company Draper Energy. It was his dream to renovate the freight depot. The depot never became part of the railroad. \n\nService was provided by a pair of 800 horsepower (600 kW), diesel engine Budd Rail Diesel Cars, previously used by BC Rail in British Columbia, Canada. Stuart Draper, the railroad's founder, died of a heart attack on January 31, 2006. In October 2006, the railroad's two RDCs were sold to the Newport Dinner Train in Rhode Island.\n\nIn March 2018 it was announced that the owner of the Milford and Bennington Railroad (the current freight operator of the rail line), in cooperation with the towns of Wilton and Greenfield, was looking at bringing back the scenic railroad. In October 2018 it was reported that the owner of the railroad had entered into a tentative agreement with an owner of passenger equipment. NHDOT is currently assessing the condition of the tracks, and the New Hampshire Attorney General is determining if the line for passenger operations needs to go out to bid. Pan Am Railways, a regional class II freight carrier, has also expressed interest in bringing back the Wilton Scenic in its first ever attempt at a heritage operation.\n\n"}

This derivative of benzidine is a precursor to polybenzimidazole, which forms fibers that are renowned for their chemical and thermal stability. As its water-soluble tetrahydrochloride, DAB has been used in immunohistochemical staining of nucleic acids and proteins.\n\nDAB is symmetric about the central carbon bond between both ring structures. In the crystal, the rings of each molecule are co-planar and the amine units connect molecules to form an intermolecular 3-dimensional hydrogen bond network.\n\nDiaminobenzidine, which is commercially available, is prepared by treating 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine with ammonia with a copper catalyst at high temperature and pressure, followed by acidic workup.\n\nAn alternate synthesis route involves the diacylation of benzidine with acetic anhydride under basic conditions:\n\nThe diacetylated compound then undergoes nitration with nitric acid to produce an ortho-dinitro compound due to the ortho-directing acetyl substituents:\n\nThe acetyl groups are then removed through saponification:\n\nThe dinitrobenzidine compound is then reduced with hydrochloric acid and iron to produce 3,3'-diaminobenzidine:\n\nThe reduction of the dinitrobenzidine compound can also proceed with tin(II) chloride instead of iron powder or with sodium dithionite in methanol.\n\nIn its main application, DAB is the precursor to polybenzimidazole.\n\nDiaminobenzidine is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of hemoglobin to give a dark-brown color. This color change is used to detect fingerprints in blood. The solubility of DAB in water allows for adaptability compared to other detection solutions which use toxic solvents. Improperly prepared tissue samples may give false positives.\nIn research, this reaction is used to stain cells that were prepared with hydrogen peroxidase enzyme, following common immunocytochemistry protocols. Relevant to Alzheimer's disease, Aβ protein amyloid plaques are targeted by a primary antibody, and subsequently by a secondary antibody, which is conjugated with a peroxidase enzyme. This will bind DAB as a substrate and oxidize it, producing an easily observable brown color. Plaques can then be quantified for further evaluation. One other method uses complexes of injected biocytin with avidin or streptavidin, biotin, and then peroxidase.\n\n"}

Appointed on 17 July 2016, he was dismissed from his role on 12 June 2017.\n\nHe is the first Secretary of State for Wales to have served as an Assembly Member, as well as the first Conservative officeholder to represent a Welsh constituency since Nicholas Edwards (1979–1987). In 2016, Jones joined the political advisory board of Leave Means Leave.\n\nDavid Jones was born in Stepney, London to Welsh parents, Elspeth () and Bryn Jones, and is a Welsh speaker. His father was a British Army officer who served in northwest India and later ran pharmacies around the Wrexham area.\n\nHe was educated at Ruabon Grammar School, University College London – where he was an active member of UCL Conservative Society – and Chester College of Law. He qualified as a solicitor in 1976, and was senior partner of a practice (David Jones & Company) based at Llandudno.\n\nAs a young solicitor he had worked in Ruthin alongside future Plaid Cymru Deputy Welsh First Minister Ieuan Wyn Jones. He also worked in a Bangor practice led by former Labour MP for Conwy, Sir Elwyn Jones.\n\nIn 1999 he contested the seat of Conwy in the inaugural Assembly Elections. In 2002, Jones unexpectedly became a member of the Welsh Assembly for the North Wales electoral region, filling the seat vacated by the ex-Welsh Office minister Rod Richards, who had resigned for health reasons.\n\nJones made it clear from the outset that he would not seek re-election to the Assembly and stepped down at the 2003 elections.\n\nAt the 2005 general election, Jones was elected as MP for Clwyd West, defeating the sitting Labour Party MP Gareth Thomas by a majority of 133 votes. This was his third candidacy for the Conservative Party in general elections; he had previously contested Conwy at the 1997 election and finished second to Labour's Christine Russell in the City of Chester in at the 2001 general election.\n\nHis maiden speech to the House of Commons was on 23 May 2005, when he focused on the needs of his rural constituency and on crime. He also expressed concern about wind farms planned for his constituency (the proposed Gwynt y Mor wind farm would be one of the biggest wind farms in the United Kingdom).\n\nHe was a member of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee from 2005 to 2010, and on 7 November 2006 was appointed Shadow Minister for Wales.

He was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Wales Office on 13 May 2010.\n\nHe was appointed Secretary of State for Wales on 4 September 2012, following David Cameron's first Cabinet reshuffle, and removed from office in another reshuffle on 14 July 2014. After Theresa May's appointment as Prime Minister, he was appointed as a Minister of State at the Department for Exiting the European Union. He was subsequently dismissed from this role on 12 June 2017.\n\nA fluent Welsh language speaker, Jones also maintains an active blog. He has been known to give up his activity on social media for Lent. His constituency office is based in Colwyn Bay.\n\nIn February 2013, \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that as Welsh Secretary Jones took a chauffeur-driven Jaguar on a journey of about 100 metres. A spokesman for the Welsh Office said: \"The Secretary of State for Wales did travel by car to Cabinet today as he was reading Cabinet papers and briefing until his arrival at Downing Street.\"\n\nDuring an interview on ITV Wales \"Face to Face\" programme in February 2013, discussing a Parliamentary vote on the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill on 5 February, Jones said: \"I was one of two cabinet ministers who did vote against it and it was for various reasons. Certainly in constituency terms, I felt that overwhelmingly the constituents of Clwyd West were opposed to the change. But also I regard marriage as an institution that has developed over many centuries, essentially for the provision of a warm and safe environment for the upbringing of children, which is clearly something that two same-sex partners can't do. Which is not to say that I'm in any sense opposed to stable and committed same-sex partnerships\". The gay rights organisation Stonewall issued a statement expressing disappointment at his comments. In a statement after the interview, Jones said: \"I made the point of stressing that I was fully supportive of committed same-sex relationships. I simply sought to point out that, since same-sex partners could not biologically procreate children, the institution of marriage was one that, in my opinion, should be reserved to opposite sex partners.\"\n\nIn 2014, Jones was accused by fellow MP Guto Bebb of being co-author of the blog \"Thoughts of Oscar\". Jones denied having anything to do with the blog, for which local newsagent Nigel Roberts claimed full responsibility. Richie Windmill, the leader of the \"Victims of Oscar\" action group, was arrested in October 2015, along with his wife, on suspicion of harassment, but were released without charge. They claimed the arrest was an act of revenge for exposing David Jones as a major contributor to the blog and accused him of using his masonic connections to arrange their arrests.\n\nOn 4 September 2012, Jones was promoted to Secretary of State for Wales, and he was in consequence appointed to the Privy Council on 10 September.\n\nJones stated his top priorities would be to promote economic growth and deliver major infrastructure projects including a new nuclear power station at the Wylfa site on Anglesey, upgrades to rail lines in North Wales and improvements to the M4 motorway and the A55, and exploiting the full economic potential of the Holyhead and Milford Haven Waterway ports.\n\nOngoing issues with the Welsh Government include a Supreme Court challenge by Her Majesty's Government to legislation passed in the Welsh Assembly about local government byelaws and the Welsh government's objection to a Wales Office consultation on changing the boundaries of assembly constituencies.\n\nJones described the Welsh Government's planning guideline Tan 8 as \"an atrocity\".\n\nFollowing Jones leading the Welsh arm of the Vote Leave campaign for the EU referendum, he was re-appointed to Theresa May's cabinet. Following her re-shuffle Jones lost his position.\n\nJones has been married to Sara Tudor, a former nurse, since 1982. The couple have two sons.\n\nJones is a supporter of Liverpool F.C.

The founding members were Farley \"Funkin\" Keith (later known as Farley \"Jackmaster\" Funk), Mickey \"Mixin\" Oliver, Ralphi Rosario, Kenny \"Jammin\" Jason, and Scott \"Smokin\" Silz. In 1984, Scott Silz was asked to leave the group and was replaced by Julian \"Jumpin\" Perez in 1985, as the winner of a HMF sponsored DJ Battle. Another DJ, Jeff Davis, was supposed to be a sixth member, but Silz mentioned in an interview that he never showed up, leaving just the five members. Julian's tenure as a member was about a year and then, Mario \"Smokin\" Diaz, became a member of this Legendary group and played with them throughout their radio time in Chicago.\n\nCreated to act as the resident DJs on Chicago FM radio station (now defunct) WBMX's Saturday Night Live Ain't No Jive mix show hosted by Armando Rivera, the members quickly established themselves as a force to be reckoned with. Soon Friday Night Jams, Mini Mixes and specialty edited remixes were added. The Chicago house music scene exploded as the Hot Mix 5 show and WBMX became the #1 Radio show in Chicago, by airing a new sound called House Music that was presented by their unique style of turntablism. Mickey Oliver became known by his editing and Turntable skills, and Farley, Ralphi and Kenny each had their own incredible unique styles. Soon the Hot Mix 5 Radio show became known all over the world as their mixes were recorded on cassette tapes and sent across America and abroad. Together, with their Turntable skills and this new genre that emerged called House Music, they broke most every Chicago House Music Records and Italo Disco tracks, while airing to millions of Chicago listeners. Together, the've became legends as their mixes are still being sold today on the likes of eBay and other outlets. Many of the Top Djs in the world have recognized the Hot Mix 5 as their mentors, as to setting the bar of what a DJ can be.\n\nThe City of Chicago, recognized the Hot Mix 5's contribution to the creation of House music and honored them by presenting each member with an individual street named after them and in addition a street called \"Hot Mix 5 Way\", which is located in downtown Chicago on the corner of Michigan Avenue and Balbo Drive. Kenny Jason was presented with a street sign which is called DJ Kenny Jammin Jason Boulevard, located on the corner of Kedzie and Logan Blvd near Logan Square in Chicago. Farley also received a street sign which is located at 13th & Michigan, also in Chicago. Today, The Hot Mix 5 DJs continue to perform globally spreading the sound of House Music. Mickey has a TV show called Intensi-T, a live stage show at the Planet Hollywood complex on the Las Vegas Strip, and mentioned as a Grammy semi finalist in 2012. Ralphi, a Grammy finalist in 2013, has produced recordings for many Major recording artists with countless charting hits.

He was appointed Secretary of State for Scotland in 2015. He has served as the Member of Parliament for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale in Scotland since 2005.\n\nHe was first elected as the MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale in 2005 and served as Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland from 2005–10 and Under-Secretary of State for Scotland from 2010–15. He served in the Cabinet as Scotland Secretary from 2015 until 2019; the first Conservative to hold the position since Michael Forsyth in 1997.\n\nBorn in Dumfries, Mundell grew up in Newton Wamphray and Lockerbie. He attended Lockerbie Academy before reading Law at the University of Edinburgh (MA), also gaining a Diploma in Legal Practice (Dip LP). After further studies, he graduated from Strathclyde Business School as MBA.\n\nHaving become a Young Conservative aged 14, he switched to the Social Democratic Party (SDP) while at university in 1981. In 2002, he stated: \"the first Thatcher Government did get a bit bogged down and it wasn't really the radical government that subsequently emerged... And the fact that you had a completely new opportunity to wipe the slate clean, with no baggage, was a very attractive thing\".\n\nHe practised as a solicitor before joining BT as Group Legal Advisor for Scotland in 1991. He became BT Scotland's Head of National Affairs, remaining with BT until being elected as an MSP. Mundell served as an SDP Councillor for Annandale and Eskdale from 1984–86 and then for Dumfries and Galloway until 1987, while a postgraduate student.\n\nMundell is a member of the Society of Writers to Her Majesty's Signet (WS) and of the Law Society of Scotland.\n\nMundell was elected to the Scottish Parliament in 1999 and 2003 as a \"list\" MSP for the South of Scotland.\n\nIn the 2005 general election, Mundell was elected as MP for the Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale constituency. Following his election to Westminster, Mundell resigned from the Scottish Parliament in June 2005. His seat was taken by Derek Brownlee, who was next on the Conservatives' South of Scotland candidate list. As the sole Conservative Scottish parliamentary representative, David Cameron (as Leader of HM Opposition) appointed him Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland in December 2005.\n\nMundell was among the 18 MPs (either Scottish or representing Scottish constituencies) who supported the Commons Motion stating football \"should not be any different from other competing sports and our young talent should be allowed to show their skills on the world stage\", thereby endorsing the idea of Team GB entering a British football team in the London 2012 Olympics. Football's governing bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland oppose a Great Britain team, fearing it would stop them competing as individual nations in future tournaments.\n\nMundell represented the Scottish Conservative Party at the three Scottish Leaders' Debates broadcast on ITV1, Sky News and BBC1 during the 2010 general election campaign.\n\nBefore the 2010 general election, Mundell served as the Conservative Shadow Scottish Secretary. Following that election, the Conservative Party formed a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. He held the non-cabinet role of Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, since the office of Secretary of State for Scotland was given to Liberal Democrat MP Danny Alexander (then Michael Moore and Alistair Carmichael), in view of the Liberal Democrats' greater representation of Scottish seats. On 9 June 2010, Mundell was appointed a Privy Counsellor.\n\nMundell was returned to Parliament at the 2015 general election with a much reduced majority of 798 votes (1.5%), although the Conservative Party's share of the vote increased by 1.8%. \nHe succeeded Liberal Democrat Alistair Carmichael as Secretary of State for Scotland, and became a part-time member of the cabinet committee working on strategies for Brexit.\nHe was the only Conservative MP to represent a Scottish constituency in the 56th parliament (2015–2017), but was joined by a further twelve in the 2017 snap general election. Following the election of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister, Mundell was sacked from his role and went to the backbenches for the first time since he was elected as an MP.\n\nMundell retained his seat at the 2019 general election with a reduced majority.\n\nIn 2015, Mundell opened a food bank in the Dumfries and Galloway constituency, which adjoins his own and was at the time represented by the Scottish National Party's Richard Arkless. After the opening, Mundell was escorted from an angry anti-austerity demonstration by police. Mundell, who had previously denied that welfare reform changes were behind the increased demand for food banks, was accused of hypocrisy by opponents who said the opening was \"nothing to celebrate\". Mundell said he was willing to work with all local organisations who wanted to eradicate poverty.\n\nOn 13 January 2016, Mundell publicly came out as gay on his personal website; he is believed to be the first openly gay Conservative cabinet minister. His nickname is 'Fluffy'.\n\nHe was previously married to Lynda Carmichael but the couple have divorced. He has three children, one of whom, Oliver Mundell, is the Conservative MSP for Dumfriesshire having won the seat in the Scottish Parliament in May 2016.\n\n"}

{"id": "1872702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872702", "title": "Alec Trevelyan", "text": "Alec Trevelyan\n\nAlec Trevelyan (006), also known as Janus, is a fictional character and the main antagonist in the 1995 James Bond film \"GoldenEye\", the first film to feature actor Pierce Brosnan as the titular spy. Trevelyan is portrayed by actor Sean Bean. The likeness of Bean as Alec Trevelyan was also used for the 1997 video game, \"GoldenEye 007\".\n\nOnce known as \"Agent 006\" under the employment of Her Majesty's Secret Service, Trevelyan betrays MI6 during a mission to blow up the Arkhangelsk chemical weapons facility in the Soviet Union while working with his close friend, James Bond (Pierce Brosnan). During the operation, Trevelyan is caught and apparently executed by the base's commander, Colonel Arkady Ourumov (Gottfried John). Presuming Trevelyan dead, Bond continues the mission and escapes aboard a supply plane. Bond later admits to M (Judi Dench) that he feels responsible for Trevelyan's apparent death.\n\nNine years later, Bond's pursuit of a stolen helicopter and investigation of an explosion at Severnaya leads him to Saint Petersburg, where he learns from Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane) that \"Janus\", the head of the crime syndicate responsible for the theft, is a Lienz Cossack. Later, when he finally meets Janus, Bond is shocked to discover Trevelyan, who staged his own execution at Arkhangelsk and now employs Ourumov, now a general in the Russian army. Trevelyan's face is scarred from the explosion at the weapons factory, a direct result of Bond changing the sequence detonation timers.\n\nTrevelyan reveals that his motive for his betrayal is a personal one. His parents were Lienz Cossacks who had collaborated with the Nazis but attempted to defect to the UK at the end of World War II. When the UK instead sent them back to the Soviets, many were executed by Joseph Stalin's death squads. Though Trevelyan's parents survived, his father, ashamed to have lived, killed his wife and himself. At the time, Trevelyan was only six years old. He was then transported to the United Kingdom and taken in by MI6, which continued to sponsor his training and education throughout his childhood (by Trevelyan's own account, MI6 thought he would've been \"too young to remember\"). He began formal work for the British government on turning 18 and began planning his revenge against the British government for his family's demise. He had considered asking his close friend to join him in his scheme but knew deep down that Bond would never betray MI6 to help him.\n\nTrevelyan's scheme begins with the theft of the experimental Tiger helicopter from the French frigate \"La Fayette\" docked in Monte Carlo, using his two primary operatives, Ourumov and Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen). With the helicopter, the two fly to the GoldenEye satellite facility in Severnaya, where they murder the staff and steal the access disk and keys for the GoldenEye satellite and program the satellite to target the facility in order to cover up the theft. The GoldenEye satellite, actually two disposable satellites named \"Petya\" and \"Mischa\", are capable of emitting targeted electromagnetic pulses capable of destroying any machinery with an electronic signal. As \"Petya\" destroys the Severnaya facility, Ourumov and Onatopp escape aboard the Tiger helicopter, which is insulated against electromagnetic radiation.\n\n\"Mischa\" would then be used to aid Trevelyan in stealing hundreds of millions of pounds sterling via computer from the Bank of England in London, and erasing all evidence of the transaction. \"Mischa\" would also erase the bank's financial records, crippling the British economy and government, triggering a catastrophic currency crisis, and causing global economic chaos.\n\nBond stops this scheme with the help of surviving Severnaya technician Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco) and CIA agent Jack Wade (Joe Don Baker). Wade helps Bond and Natalya track Trevelyan's headquarters, and Natalya subsequently programs the GoldenEye satellite to crash after resetting the access codes. As Bond attempts to disable the GoldenEye antenna, Trevelyan attacks him. In the subsequent fight, Trevelyan finally gets the better of Bond, and is about to shoot him when Bond kicks a ladder releasing it and carrying Bond to the bottom of a satellite antenna, suspended high above the dish. Trevelyan then climbs down to Bond, who slips and is just able to stay on the tiny platform. Bond eventually knocks Trevelyan off the antenna, but reflexively grabs him by the leg. While hanging, Trevelyan smugly asks Bond, \"For England, James?\" to which Bond replies, \"No, for me.\" Bond then lets go, and Trevelyan falls all the way down to the dish; he survives, but is mortally wounded. Moments later, the antenna array, due to Bond's sabotage, explodes and collapses in a fiery wreck on top of Trevelyan, killing him.\n\n\nTrevelyan is the only 00 Agent (other than Bond himself) to have a substantial role in a Bond film, which includes a sizeable screen and speaking time. The only other 00 agent to have any amount of screentime in a Bond film is \"Octopussy\"s 009, portrayed by stuntman Andy Bradford. Apart from seeing the back of their heads or shortly before they are killed and/or dead already (\"Thunderball\", \"A View to a Kill\", and \"The Living Daylights\"), other 00 agents are rarely seen and only spoken of. When Bean auditioned for the film, he was considered for the role of Bond (see List of actors considered for the James Bond character).\n\nTrevelyan has been ranked among the greatest Bond villains and is considered the dark inversion of Bond.\n"}

After leaving school, she worked as an accounts clerk in the Team Valley, then attended Newcastle College and the Trades Union Congress Academy in London.\n\nHodgson later worked for Northern Rock in Gosforth, and then as a payroll and accounting clerk for local companies. After being a full-time mother for a few years in the mid-1990s, and volunteering for the Labour Party in Stockton-on-Tees during the 1997 general election campaign, she became a party organiser in 1999.\n\nIn 2000, she became the local Party organiser for two years in the Mitcham and Morden constituency, helping the sitting Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh to be re-elected at the 2001 general election.

Micropolygons allow a renderer to create a highly detailed image.\n\nThe concept of micropolygons was developed within the Reyes algorithm, in which geometric primitives are tessellated at render time into a rectangular grid of tiny, four-sided polygons. A shader might fill each micropolygon with a single color or assign colors on a per-vertex basis. Shaders that operate on micropolygons can process an entire grid of them at once in SIMD fashion. This often leads to faster shader execution, and allows shaders to compute spatial derivatives (e.g. for texture filtering) by comparing values at neighboring micropolygon vertices.\n\nFurthermore, a renderer using micropolygons can support displacement mapping simply by perturbing micropolygon vertices during shading. This displacement is usually not limited to the local surface normal but can be given an arbitrary direction.\n\n"}

He has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Gravesham since 2005. He has been a vocal supporter of pro-Brexit lobby group Leave Means Leave.\n\nHolloway was born on the 29 July 1965 in Faversham, Kent, the son of the Revd Roger Holloway OBE (died 2010). He was privately educated at Cranleigh School before going to Magdalene College, Cambridge where he studied social and political sciences, graduating as MA, before postgraduate studies at Imperial College London (MBA).\n\nAfter graduating from university Holloway attended the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, from which he was commissioned into the British Army's Grenadier Guards in 1987. During his four-year military career he saw service with the British Army on the Rhine as an Armoured Infantry platoon officer, and in the Persian Gulf War.\n\nAfter resigning from the Army in 1991 with the rank of Captain, Holloway worked as an investigative journalist and reporter with ITN, \"World in Action\", \"Panorama\", and also the \"Sunday Times\". During his media career he produced an award-winning documentary series for ITV called \"No Fixed Abode\" (1991), in which he spent three months homeless on the streets of London examining the plight of the capital's growing homeless population, particularly those with mental health issues.\n\nHolloway was elected in the 2005 general election to represent the Kent constituency of Gravesham, defeating a former Labour Minister, Chris Pond, by just 654 votes, but with one of the largest swings from Labour to Conservative in the country at 4.9% at that general election. This was the first time since the Second World War that Gravesham (or its predecessor Gravesend constituency) had not been held by the party of Government.\n\nHe delivered his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 28 June 2005. Holloway was also invited to speak (on 15 September 2006) alongside US Congressman John Shimkus to students on the campus of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE).\n\nIn 2009 a report written by Holloway suggested that some of the claims about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction used to support the UK government's case for war in 2003 originated from an Iraqi taxi driver, and that this may have included the claim about them being ready to launch in 45 minutes\". According to Holloway, reservations expressed by MI6 analysts about much of the data were ignored when preparing the case for war under pressure from Downing Street.\n\nHe was criticised in the local media in May 2009 for having the highest expenses claims in North Kent, but argued his claims were legitimate. In the wake of the Westminster Parliamentary Expenses scandal in 2009, Holloway was ordered by Sir Thomas Legg, the head of a committee examining abuse of expenses by Members of Parliament, to repay £1000 to the Exchequer which he had over-claimed. In July 2009, he was criticised by a local newspaper after he responded to a request for an interview about his plans for the summer recess with an expletive laden rejection. This came after all the other local MPs had given answers to the newspapers questions.\n\nHolloway was returned as MP for Gravesham on 6 May 2010 with 22,956 votes (48.5% of the vote) and with an increased majority of 9,312. He went on to be re-elected in 2015 and 2017.\n\nIn October 2010 he was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to David Lidington, Minister of State for Europe and NATO in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In 2011, he resigned this junior governmental post to defy of a three-line (party) whip and vote in favour of an early referendum on membership of the EU. \nIn October 2014 he was one of just six Conservative MPs to vote against air strikes targeting Islamic State in Iraq, after visiting a border region held by the Kurdish Peshmerga. He argued the campaign hadn't \"been thought through\". He actively abstained in the vote for air strikes in Syria in November 2015.\n\nIn a September 2015 Parliamentary speech Holloway described giving asylum to refugees from the Middle East as \"bonkers\", stating than many asylum seekers go on holiday in the countries they had fled from and used his barber as an example. His barber, a Kurdish refugee, subsequently stated that he was holidaying in Great Yarmouth that week, not Iraq.\n\nHolloway publicly supported the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum.\n\nHe was criticised by political rivals in June 2017 after he was seen campaigning with Janice Atkinson, a former UKIP MEP, who had been suspended from her former party after a fraud enquiry was started relating to her expenses and who had subsequently become vice-president of Marine Le Pen's far-right European Parliament grouping.\n\nAs Chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on drones, Holloway provided an article to \"Politics Home\" and was interviewed about drones on BBC Radio 5 Live on 17 July 2018.\n\nHolloway was a member of the Defence Select Committee from 2006 to 2010, and served for a time as Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Middle East Council. In Parliament, he has additionally been a member of the Science and Technology Committee, the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Public Administration Committee.\n\nIn April 2018, Holloway said in Parliament that sleeping rough is \"a lot more comfortable\" than military exercises and that the majority of rough sleepers were \"foreign nationals\", in a debate on tackling street homelessness. Rival politicians and charities pointed to evidence that 78 homeless people had died the previous winter and that 80% of recorded homeless people were UK nationals. Holloway defended his position during the debate by pointing to his personal experience of being in the army and having spent several months sleeping on the streets as part of a television programme.\n\nIn 2020, he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary of State Robert Jenrick.\n\n"}

This area was explored in 1847 by the botanist Robert Wight.\n\nThe national park is one of the last undisturbed tracts of South Western Ghats mountain rain forests and tropical moist evergreen forest in India. Contiguous with the proposed Karimpuzha National Park () to the north and Mukurthi National Park (78.46 km) to the north-east, it is the core of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (1,455.4 km), and is part of the Nilgiri Sub-Cluster (6,000 km), Western Ghats World Heritage Site, recognised by UNESCO in 2007.\n\nPlans for a hydroelectric project that threatened the park's biodiversity stimulated an environmentalist social movement in the 1970s, known as the Save Silent Valley movement, which resulted in cancelling the project and creating the park in 1980. The visitors' centre for the park is at Sairandhri.\n\nThe Silent Valley region is locally known as \"\"Sairandhrivanam\"\", which in Malayalam means \"Sairandhri's Forest\". Sairandhri is Draupadi, the wife of the Pandavas in the epic Mahabharatha, who disguised herself as Sairandhri, the maid of a queen named Sudeshna, while her family was in exile. The Pandavas, deprived of their kingdom, set out on a 13-year exile. They wandered south, into what is now Kerala, until one day they came upon a magical valley where rolling grasslands met wooded ravines, a deep green river bubbled its course through impenetrable forest, where at dawn and twilight the tiger and elephant would drink together at the water's edge, where all was harmonious and man unknown. Beside that river, in a cave on a hill slope, the Pandavas halted.\n\nThe first Western investigation of the watersheds of the Silent Valley area was in 1857 by the botanist Robert Wight. The British named the area Silent Valley because of a perceived absence of noisy cicadas. Another story attributes the name to the anglicisation of Sairandhri. A third story, refers to the presence there of many lion-tailed macaques \"Macaca silenus\". \nIn 1914 the forest of the Silent Valley area was declared a reserve forest, however, from 1927 to 1976 portions of the Silent Valley forest area were subjected to forestry operations. In 1928 the location on the Kunthipuzha River at Sairandhri was identified as an ideal site for electricity generation and in 1958 a study and survey of the area was conducted and a hydroelectric project of 120 MV costing Rs. 17 crore was proposed by the Kerala State Electricity Board.\n\nSilent Valley is home to the largest population of lion-tailed macaques, an endangered species of primate. Public controversy over their habitat led to the establishment of Silent Valley National Park.\n\nIn 1973 the valley became the focus of \"Save Silent Valley\", India's fiercest environmental movement of the decade, when the Kerala State Electricity Board decided to implement the Silent Valley Hydro-Electric Project (SVHEP) centered on a dam across the Kunthipuzha River. The resulting reservoir would flood 8.3 km of virgin rainforest and threaten the lion-tailed macaque. In 1976 the Kerala State Electricity Board announced plans to begin dam construction and the issue was brought to public attention. Romulus Whitaker, founder of the Madras Snake Park and the Madras Crocodile Bank, was probably the first person to draw public attention to the small and remote area.\n\nIn 1981 Prof.C.V.Subramanian, the internationally acclaimed Mycologist, wrote to Mrs Indira Gandhi, seeking her intervention to stop the Dam construction which held very unique Flora and fauna. Prof Subramanian also submitted a report on the Silent Valley on the basis of which Mrs Gandhi, decided to abandon the project. The Silent Valley forests were declared as a National Park. On 7 September 1985 the Silent Valley National Park was formally inaugurated and a memorial at Sairandhri to Indira Gandhi was unveiled by Rajiv Gandhi, her son and the next Prime Minister. On 1 September 1986 Silent Valley National Park was designated as the core area of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Since then, a long-term conservation effort has been undertaken to preserve the Silent Valley ecosystem.\n\nIn 2001 a new hydro project was proposed and the \"Man vs. Monkey debate\" was revived. The proposed site of the dam (64.5 m high and 275 m long) is just 3.5 km downstream of the old dam site at Sairandhiri, 500 m outside the National Park boundary. The Kerala Minister for Electricity called The Pathrakkadavu dam (PHEP) an \"eco-friendly alternative\" to the old Silent Valley project. The claim was that the submergence area of the PHEP would be a negligible .041 km compared to 8.30 km submergence of the 1970s (SVHEP).\nFrom January to May 2003, a rapid Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out. On 15 November, Minister for Forest Binoy Viswam said that the proposed buffer zone for Silent Valley would be declared soon.\n\nOn 21 February 2007 ex-Chief Minister A. K. Antony told reporters after a cabinet meeting that \"when the Silent Valley proposal was dropped, the centre had promised to give clearance to the Pooyamkutty project. This promise, however, had not been honoured. The Kerala \"government has not taken any decision\" on reviving the Silent Valley Hydel Project\".\n\nOn 18 April 2007, Kerala Chief Minister V S Achuthanandan and his cabinet approved the Pathrakkadavu Hydro-electric project and sent it to the Union Government for environmental approval.\n\nTerritorial forests located around the national park have been subject to a working-plan to accomplish revenue oriented objectives such as extraction of bamboo and reed which affect the long-term conservation of the park. In addition Illegal activities such as ganja cultivation, setting forest fires, trapping and poaching wild animals, frequently occur in the territorial forests located in the immediate vicinity of the national park. This has resulted in degradation of habitat and reduced forest cover, which has adverse effects on the long-term survival of the core area of the national park.\nOn 21 November 2009, Union Minister of Forest and Environment Jairam Ramesh and Kerala Forest Minister Binoy Viswam declared, while inaugurating the silver jubilee celebration of Silent Valley National Park in Palakkad, that the buffer zone of the Park would be made an integral part of it in order to ensure better protection of the area. This means that the total park area is now increased to . It is now the largest national park in Kerala.\n\nOn 6 June 2007 the Kerala cabinet approved the buffer zone proposal. The new 147.22 km zone will include 80.75 km taken from Attapady Forest Range, 27.09 km from Mannarkkad Forest Range and 39.38 km from Kalikavu Forest Range and consolidated to form a new range, Bhavani Forest Range, of 94 km and 54 km would be brought under the existing Silent Valley Range of the National Park. The Cabinet also sanctioned 35 staff to protect the area and two new forest stations in Bhavani range at Anavai and Thudukki. Forest Minister Benoy Viswom said \"the zone would have reserve forest status and tribals in the area would not be affected. The decision reaffirmed the commitment of the LDF Government to protection of environment. The zone is a necessity, not just of the State but also of the nation.\"\n\nThe proposal was then sent to Kerala Minister for Electricity, Mr. A.K. Balan, who has voiced the need for setting up the Pathrakadavu hydroelectric project in the proposed southwest buffer zone of the National Park, the Thenkara Range of the Mannarkkad Forest Division. As of 9 May 2007 Mr. Balan has not given his opinion on the buffer zone proposal.\nIn August 2006, the new Minister for Forests, Benoy Viswom, approved a proposal from the Conservator of Forests for a 148 km buffer zone around the core area of the park. The proposal says: \"It is felt absolutely essential that an effective buffer of forests should be immediately formed around the national park in order to save the world famous Silent Valley National Park from all potential dangers. This can only be achieved by bringing the management of Silent Valley National Park as well as the proposed buffer zone under one management umbrella to insulate the park from all possible dangers.\" The proposed buffer zone will have 94 km in Attappady Reserve Forest east of the Kunthipuzha and 54 km taken from the Mannarkaad range and Nilambur south division west of the river.\n\nIn January 2006, the former Kerala Minister for Forest and Environment, A. Sujanapal, said the Government would consider the demand for a 600 km buffer zone for Silent Valley National Park made by Bharathapuzha Protection Committee, Malampuzha Protection Committee, One Earth One Life and Jana Jagratha. A buffer zone proposal was made in the 1986 park management plan but not implemented.\nIn 1979, Dr. M.S. Swaminathan, then Secretary to the Department of Agriculture, visited the Silent Valley area and suggested that 389.52 km including the Silent Valley (89.52 km), New Amarambalam (80 km), Attappadi (120 km) in Kerala and Kunda in Coimbatore (100 km) reserve forests, should be developed into a National Rainforest Biosphere Reserve.\n\nSilent Valley is rectangular, twelve kilometres from north to south and seven from east to west. Located between 11°03' to 11°13' N (latitude) and 76°21' to 76°35' E (longitude) it is separated from the eastern and northern high altitude plateaus of the (Nilgiris Mountains) by high continuous ridges including Sispara Peak (2,206 m) at the north end of the park. The park gradually slopes southward down to the Palakkad plains and to the west it is bounded by irregular ridges. The altitude varies from 658 m to 2328 m at Anginda Peak, but most of the park lies within the altitude range of 880 m to 1200 m. Soils are blackish and slightly acidic in evergreen forests where there is good accumulation of organic matter. The underlying rock in the area is granite with schists and gneiss, which give rise to the loamy laterite soils on slopes.\n\nThe Kunthipuzha River drains the entire 15 km length of the park from north to south into the Bharathapuzha River. Kunthipuzha River divides the park into a narrow eastern sector of width 2 kilometers and a wide western sector of 5 kilometers. The river is characterized by its crystal clear water and perennial nature. The main tributaries of the river, Kunthancholapuzha, Karingathodu, Madrimaranthodu, Valiaparathodu and Kummaathanthodu originate on the upper slopes of the eastern side of the valley. The river is uniformly shallow, with no flood plains or meanders. Its bed falls from 1,861 m to 900 m over a distance of 12 km, the last 8 km being particularly level with a fall of only 60 m. Kunthipuzha is one of the less torrential rivers of the Western Ghats, with a pesticide-free catchment area.\n\nSilent Valley gets copious amounts of rainfall during the monsoons, but the actual amount varies within the region due to the varied topography. In general, rainfall is higher at higher altitudes and decreases from the west to the east due to the rain shadow effect. Eighty per cent of the rainfall occurs during the south-west monsoon between June and September. The park also receives a significant amount of rainfall during the north-east monsoon between October and November.\n\nThe park being completely enclosed within a ring of hills, has its own micro-climate and probably receives some convectional rainfall, in addition to rain from the two monsoons. In the remaining months, condensation on vegetation of mist shrouding the valley is estimated to yield 15 per cent of the total water generated in the rainforest.\n\nIn 2006, the Walakkad area of the park received the highest ever annual rainfall of 9,569.6 mm. In 2000, the figure was 7,788 mm; in 2001, 8,351.9 mm; in 2004, 8465.3 mm; and in 2005, 9,347.8 mm. The annual rainfall received in the valley (at Sairandhri?) was 7,788.8 mm in 2000; 8,361.9 mm in 2001. In 2002, 4,262.5 mm; in 2003, 3,499.65 mm; in 2004, 6,521.27 mm, in 2005, 6,919.38 mm; in 2006, 6,845.05 mm; in 2007, 6,009.35 mm; and in 2008 it was 4386.5 mm. The figure till October 2009 was 5,477.4 mm. Average annual rainfall in the park between 2000 and 2008 was thus 6,066 mm.\n\nThe mean annual temperature is 20.2 °C. The hottest months are April and May when the mean temperature is 23 °C and the coolest months are January and February when the mean temperature is 18 °C. Because of the high rainfall, the relative humidity is consistently high (above 95%) between June and December.\n\nThere is no record of the valley ever having been settled, but the Mudugar and Irula tribal people are indigenous to the area and do live in the adjacent valley of Attappady Reserved Forest. Also, the Kurumbar people live in the highest range outside the park bordering on the Nilgiris.\n\nMany of the Mudugar, Irula and Kurumbar now work as day labourers and porters. Some work for the Forest Department in the park as forest guards and visitor guides. 16 out of 21 tribal colonies in the Attappady range cultivate marijuana. Many Mudugar are in abject poverty and easily recruited by the so-called \"ganja mafia\". In 2006, it was planned to employ 50 additional men from the 21 tribal settlements as forest guards.<ref name=\"Hindu3/12/06\"></ref>\n\nThe valley areas of the park are in a Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests Ecoregion. Hilly areas above 1,000 m are in the South Western Ghats montane rain forests region. Above 1,500 m, the evergreen forests begin to give way to stunted forests, called sholas, interspersed with open grassland, both of which are of interest to ecologists as the rich biodiversity here has never been disturbed by human settlements. Several threatened species are endemic here. New plant and animal species are often discovered here. \nBirdlife International lists 16 bird species in Silent Valley as threatened or restricted:- Nilgiri wood-pigeon, Malabar parakeet, Malabar grey hornbill, white-bellied treepie, grey-headed bulbul, broad-tailed grassbird, rufous babbler, Wynaad laughing thrush, Nilgiri laughing thrush, Nilgiri blue robin, black-and-rufous flycatcher, Nilgiri flycatcher, white-bellied blue-flycatcher, crimson-backed sunbird and Nilgiri pipit. \nRare bird species found here include the Ceylon frogmouth and great Indian hornbill. The 2006 winter bird survey discovered the long-legged buzzard, a new species of raptor at Sispara, the park's highest peak. The survey found 10 endangered species recorded in the IUCN Red List including the red winged crested cuckoo, Malabar pied hornbill and pale harrier. The area is home to 15 endemic species including the black-and-orange flycatcher. It recorded 138 species of birds including 17 species that were newly observed in the Silent Valley area. The most abundant bird was the black bulbul.\n\nThere are at least 34 species of mammals at Silent Valley including the threatened lion-tailed macaque, Niligiri langur, Malabar giant squirrel, Nilgiri tahr, Peshwa's bat (\"Myotis peshwa\") and hairy-winged bat. There are nine species of bats, rats and mice.<ref name=\"Hindu7/29/01\"></ref>\n\nDistribution and demography of all diurnal primates were studied in Silent Valley National Park and adjacent areas for a period of three years from 1993 to 1996. Fourteen troops of lion-tailed macaque, eighty-five troops of Nilgiri langur, fifteen troops of bonnet macaque and seven troops of Hanuman langur were observed. Of these, the Nilgiri langur was randomly distributed, whereas the lion-tailed macaque troops were confined to the southern sector of the Park. Bonnet macaques and Hanuman langurs were occasional visitors. The Silent Valley forest remains one of the most undisturbed viable habitats left for the endemic and endangered primates lion-tailed macaque and Nilgiri langur.\n\nTiger, leopard, leopard cat, jungle cat, common palm civet, small Indian civet, brown palm civet, ruddy mongoose, stripe-necked mongoose, dhole, clawless otter, sloth bear, small Travancore flying squirrel, Indian pangolin (scaly anteater), porcupine, wild boar, sambar, spotted deer, barking deer, mouse deer, elephant and gaur also live here.\n\nThere are at least 730 identified species of insects in the park. The maximum number of species belong to the orders Lepidoptera and Coleoptera. Many unclassified species have been collected and there is a need for further studies.\n\n33 species of crickets and grasshoppers have been recorded of which one was new. 41 species of true bugs (eight new) have been recorded. 128 species of beetles including 10 new species have been recorded.\n\nOver 128 species of butterflies and 400 species of moths live here. A 1993 study found butterflies belonging to 9 families. The families Nymphalidae and Papilionidae contained the maximum number of species. 13 species were endemic to South India, including 5 species having protected status.\nSeven species of butterflies were observed migrating in a mixed swarm of thousands of butterflies towards the Silent Valley National Park. In one instance an observer noted several birds attempting to catch these butterflies.\n\nA survey jointly conducted by Indian Dragonfly Society and the Forest and Wildlife Department in September 2018 in the buffer zone of the Silent Valley National Park found 82 species of odonata. The species found include \"Indosticta deccanensis\", \"Burmagomphus laidlawi\", \"Microgomphus souteri\", \"Onychogomphus nilgiriensis\", \"Euphaea dispar\", \"Idionyx travancorensis\", \"Megalogomphus hannyngtoni\" and \"Lestes dorothea\".\n\nAt least 500 species of earthworms and leeches have also been identified in the park.\n\nThe Silent Valley Bush Frog, \"Raorchestes silentvalley\", first described in 2016, is named after the park.\n\nThe flora of the valley include about a 1000 species of flowering plants, 108 species of orchids, 100 ferns and fern allies, 200 liverworts, 75 lichens and about 200 algae. A majority of these plants are endemic to the Western Ghats.\n\n\"Angiosperm\" flora currently identified here include 966 species belonging to 134 families and 599 genera. There are 701 \"Dicotyledons\" distributed among 113 families and 420 genera. There are 265 \"Monocotyledons\" here distributed among 21 families and 139 genera. Families best represented are the \"Orchids\" with 108 species including the rare, endemic and highly endangered orchids Ipsea malabarica, Bulbophyllum silentvalliensis and Eria tiagii, \"Grasses\" (56), \"Legumes\" (55), \"Rubiaceae\" (49) and \"Asters\" (45). There are many rare, endemic and economically valuable species, such as cardamom \"Ellettaria cardamomum\", black pepper \"Piper nigrum\", yams \"Dioscorea spp.\", beans \"Phaseolus sp.\", a pest-resistant strain of rice \"Oryza Pittambi\", and 110 plant species of importance in Ayurvedic medicine. Seven new plant species have been recorded from Silent Valley, including in 1996, \"Impatiens sivarajanii\", a new species of \"Balsaminaceae\".\n\nOccurrence of lion-tailed macaque is dependent on the flowering of \"Cullenia exarillata\" in the forest.\n\nSix distinct tree associations have been described in the valley. Three are restricted to the southern sector:\n\nThe remainder are confined to the central and northern parts of the park:\n\nA study of natural regeneration of 12 important tree species of Silent Valley tropical rain forests showed good natural regeneration of all 12 species. The species studied were \"Palaquium ellipticum\", \"Cullenia exarillata\", \"Poeciloneuron indicum\", \"Myristica dactyloides\", \"Elaeocarpus glandulosus\", \"Litsea floribunda\", \"Mesua nagassarium\", \"Cinnamomum malabatrum\", \"Agrostistachys meeboldii\", \"Calophyllum polyanthum\", \"Garcinia morella\" and \"Actinodaphne campanulata\".\n\nRecent selective felling of three trees per acre, has led to the cutting of 48,000 m of timber from about 20 km.\nThere is a huge hollow kattualying tree here which can fit 12 people inside.\n\nThroughout human history about 10% of the genetic stock found in the wild has been bred into palatable and higher yielding cereals, fruits and vegetables. Future food security depends on the preservation of the remaining 90% of the stock through protection of high biodiversity habitats like Silent valley.\n\nThe National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources of ICAR (India), Plant Exploration and Collection Division has identified Silent Valley as high in bio-diversity and an important Gene Pool resource for Recombinant DNA innovations. An important example of use of wild germplasm is gene selection from the wild varieties of rice \"Oryza nivara\" (Central India) \" and Oryza Pittambi\" found in Silent Valley for the traits of broad spectrum disease resistance in high yielding hybrid rice varieties including IR-36, which are responsible for much of the Green Revolution throughout Asia.\n\nAlso, genetic evaluation of plant growth promoting Rhizobacteria obtained from Silent Valley indicated that strain, IISR 331, could increase the growth of black pepper cuttings by 228% and showed 82.7% inhibition of the common plant wilting disease \"Phytopthora capsici\" in laboratory tests (in vitro).\n\nFire is one of the major threats facing forests in Kerala. People engaged in grazing livestock often burn an area to get fresh grass shoots for their cattle, especially during dry season when fire danger is greatest. Also, illicit activities like ganja cultivation, poaching, tree felling, non timber forest products (NTFP) collection and very often careless tourists and pilgrims are responsible for big forest fires.\n\nSilent Valley is home to some of India's largest illegal plantations of cannabis. Cannabis is one of the traditional plantations in these forests and there are people who depend on 'Ganja economy' for a livelihood. Tribes like Irula, Muduga and Kurumba (particularly the last one) have always grown cannabis in their history. The seedless variety of cannabis cultivated in Silent Valley is known as \"Sairandhri\" and is renowned internationally for its quality.\n\nAccording to former additional chief secretary Madhava Menon, the cannabis cultivated here is one of the best in the world and is sold worldwide. The cannabis mafia has cut hundreds of acres of evergreen tropical forest in the Attappady Hills, including Silent Valley buffer zones, for illegal cultivation of the cash crop. The Forest Department had an ambitious plan to root out ganja cultivation from the Attappady forests by April 2006.\n\nThe ticket counter of the Silent Valley National Park at Mukkali was attacked by a group of Maoists in December, 2014. A big contingent of special police has been deployed there since then, but the growing influence of Maoist groups in tribal east Kerala is of grave concern.\n\n\n"}

He is a founding member of the Stuckists art group. His work has been called \"raw and autobiographical\".\n\nJoseph Machine was born in Chatham, Kent, and comes from a Romany background on the Isle of Sheppey.\nIn 1988 Machine was sent to Alston House Approved School, Rochester, for the theft of scrap material, and the following year to Dover Borstal for young offenders, after burgling a greengrocers in Leysdown (Isle of Sheppey). He spent time claiming benefits and running the family business, an amusement arcade in Leysdown, as well as breeding Rottweiler dogs and working as a bouncer in South London night clubs.\n\nHe started painting around 1988 and has not had any formal college art training. He has described creativity as the way out of the background in which he felt trapped: \"Painting and writing have been far better for me than any of the mistakes I made in stealing and fighting.\"\n\nSince 1998 he has been having psychotherapy to deal with violence and sex problems.\n\nIn 1999 he was one of the 13 original founder members of the Stuckists, an anti-conceptual art group co-founded by Billy Childish and Charles Thomson. His painting \"Diana Dors With an Axe\" was used on the front cover of the first book on the group, \"The Stuckists\", and also to promote the show \"The Real Turner Prize Show\" in Shoreditch in 2000.\nMachine has exhibited widely with the Stuckists, most notably in their first national museum exhibition, at the Walker Art Gallery for the 2004 Liverpool Biennial. The exhibition, titled \"The Stuckists Punk Victorian\", was a definitive showing of the Stuckist oeuvre, and Machine was one of the \"featured artists\". Reviewing the Walker show, Mark Lawson commented, referring to Machine's painting, \"Sea Shanty\":\nIn January 2005, he took part in a Stuckist protest at the launch of the \"Triumph of Painting\" show at the Saatchi Gallery in London. In December that year he was part of the Stuckist protest outside the Turner Prize at Tate Britain to draw attention to the Tate's purchase of its trustee Chris Ofili's work \"The Upper Room\" and demand the resignation of Tate Director, Sir Nicholas Serota.\n\nMachine was one of the ten leading Stuckist artists to show in the Go West at Spectrum London gallery in October 2006, where six of his paintings sold in advance of the show opening.\n\nMachine commented on the Stuckists: \"some of the paintings are not all that marvellous ... But everyone's painting and getting involved\". Billy Childish owns a Machine painting of a woman slashing her wrists, which he describes as \"quite disturbing\".\n\nMachine sang with the \"junk\" group, The Dirty Numbers, and has published six poetry books.\n\nIn 2003 Machine married Charlotte Gavin, who has exhibited her work in Stuckist shows.\n\nMachine's work is strongly autobiographical and often draws on life experiences of sex and violence. Machine works with a limited range of mostly five colours (which Machine claims was initially due to poverty), and has cited his grandfather, who used to paint, as a major influence.\n\nRecurrent images are emaciated women, sailors and bloodshed. He has shown fighting dogs and a sailor having his throat slit . Other images are Ute Lemper, and Diana Dors with an axe and also with a sub-machine gun. \"My Grandfather Will Fight You\" depicts a gaunt older man with clenched fists and blood-spattered shirt, painted on two wooden boards nailed together.

{"id": "1872736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872736", "title": "Apex predator", "text": "Apex predator\n\nApex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management, conservation and ecotourism.\n\nApex predators have a long evolutionary history, dating at least to the Cambrian period when animals such as \"Anomalocaris\" dominated the seas.\n\nHumans have for many centuries interacted with apex predators including the wolf, birds of prey and cormorants to hunt game animals, birds, and fish respectively. More recently, humans have started interacting with apex predators in new ways. These include interactions via ecotourism, such as with the tiger shark, and through rewilding efforts, such as the proposed reintroduction of the lynx.\n\nApex predators affect prey species' population dynamics and populations of other predators, both in aquatic and in terrestrial ecosystems. Non-native predatory fish, for instance, have sometimes devastated formerly dominant predators. A lake manipulation study found that when the non-native smallmouth bass was removed, lake trout, the suppressed native apex predator, diversified its prey selection and increased its trophic level. As a terrestrial example, the badger, an apex predator, predates on and also competes with the hedgehog, a mesopredator, for food such as insects, small mammals, reptiles, amphibians and ground-nesting bird's eggs. Removal of badgers (in a trial investigating bovine tuberculosis) caused hedgehog densities to more than double. Predators that exert a top-down control on organisms in their community are often considered keystone species. Humans are not considered apex predators because their diets are typically diverse, although human trophic levels increase with consumption of meat.\nApex predators can have profound effects on ecosystems, as the consequences of both controlling prey density and restricting smaller predators, and may be capable of self-regulation. They are central to the functioning of ecosystems, the regulation of disease, and the maintenance of biodiversity. When introduced to subarctic islands, for example, Arctic foxes' predation of seabirds has been shown to turn grassland into tundra. Such wide-ranging effects on lower levels of an ecosystem are termed trophic cascades. The removal of top-level predators, often through human agency, can cause or disrupt trophic cascades. For example, reduction in the population of sperm whales, apex predators with a fractional trophic level of 4.7, by hunting has caused an increase in the population of large squid, trophic level over 4 (carnivores that eat other carnivores). This effect, called mesopredator release, occurs in terrestrial and marine ecosystems; for instance, in North America, the ranges of all apex carnivores have contracted whereas those of 60% of mesopredators have grown in the past two centuries.\n\nBecause apex predators have powerful effects on other predators, on herbivores, and on plants, they can be important in nature conservation. Humans have hunted many apex predators close to extinction, but in some parts of the world these predators are now returning. They are increasingly threatened by climate change. For example, the polar bear requires extensive areas of sea ice to hunt its prey, typically seals, but climate change is shrinking the sea ice of the Arctic, forcing polar bears to fast on land for increasingly long periods.\n\nDramatic changes in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem were recorded after the gray wolf, both an apex predator and a keystone species (one with a large effect on its ecosystem), was reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park in 1995 as a conservation measure. Elk, the wolves' primary prey, became less abundant and changed their behavior, freeing riparian zones from constant grazing and allowing willows, aspens and cottonwoods to flourish, creating habitats for beaver, moose and scores of other species. In addition to their effect on prey species, the wolves' presence also affected one of the park's vulnerable species, the grizzly bear: emerging from hibernation, having fasted for months, the bears chose to scavenge wolf kills, especially during the autumn as they prepared to hibernate once again. The grizzly bear gives birth during hibernation, so the increased food supply is expected to produce an increase in the numbers of cubs observed. Dozens of other species, including eagles, ravens, magpies, coyotes and black bears have also been documented as scavenging from wolf kills within the park.\n\nEcologists have debated whether humans are apex predators. For instance, Sylvain Bonhommeau and colleagues argued in 2013 that across the global food web, a fractional human trophic level (HTL) can be calculated as the mean trophic level of every species in the human diet, weighted by the proportion which that species forms in the diet. This analysis gives an average HTL of 2.21, varying between 2.04 (for Burundi, with a 96.7% plant-based diet) and 2.57 (for Iceland, with 50% meat and fish, 50% plants). These values are comparable to those of non-apex predators such as anchovy or pig.\n\nHowever, Peter D. Roopnarine criticised Bonhommeau's approach in 2014, arguing that humans are apex predators, and that the HTL was based on terrestrial farming where indeed humans have a low trophic level, mainly eating producers (crop plants at level 1) or primary consumers (herbivores at level 2), which as expected places humans at a level slightly above 2. Roopnarine instead calculated the position of humans in two marine ecosystems, a Caribbean coral reef and the Benguela system near South Africa. In these systems, humans mainly eat predatory fish and have a fractional trophic level of 4.65 and 4.5 respectively, which in Roopnarine's view makes those humans apex predators.\n\nApex predators are thought to have existed since at least the Cambrian period, around 500 million years ago. Extinct species cannot be directly determined to be apex predators as their behaviour cannot be observed, and clues to ecological relationships, such as bite marks on bones or shells, do not form a complete picture. However, indirect evidence such as the absence of any discernible predator in an environment is suggestive. \"Anomalocaris\" was an aquatic apex predator, in the Cambrian. Its mouthparts are clearly predatory, and there were no larger animals in the seas at that time.\n\nCarnivorous theropod dinosaurs including \"Allosaurus\" and \"Tyrannosaurus\" have been described as apex predators, based on their size, morphology, and dietary needs. \n\nA Permian shark, \"Triodus sessilis\", was discovered containing two amphibians (\"Archegosaurus decheni\" and \"Cheliderpeton latirostre\"), one of which had consumed a fish, \"Acanthodes bronni\", showing that the shark had lived at a trophic level of at least 4.\n\nAmong more recent fossils, the sabre-tooth cats, like \"Smilodon\", are considered to have been apex predators in the Cenozoic.\n\nHumans hunted with wolves and in turn with domestic dogs for some 40,000 years; this collaboration may have helped modern humans to outcompete the Neanderthals. Humans still hunt with dogs, which have often been bred as gun dogs to point to, flush out, or retrieve prey. The Portuguese Water Dog was used to drive fish into nets. Several breeds of dog have been used to chase large prey such as deer and wolves. \n\nEagles and falcons, which are apex predators, are used in falconry, hunting birds or mammals. Tethered cormorants, also top predators, have been used to catch fish.\n\nEcotourism sometimes relies on apex predators to attract business. Tour operators may in consequence decide to intervene in ecosystems, for example by providing food to attract predators to areas that can conveniently be visited. This in turn can have effects on predator population and therefore on the wider ecosystem. As a result, provisioning of species such as the tiger shark is controversial, but its effects are not well established by empirical evidence. Other affected apex predators include big cats and crocodiles.\n\nIn some densely populated areas like the British Isles, all the large native predators like the wolf, bear, wolverine and lynx have become locally extinct, allowing herbivores such as deer to multiply unchecked except by hunting. In 2015, plans were made to reintroduce lynx to the counties of Norfolk, Cumbria, and Northumberland in England, and Aberdeenshire in Scotland as part of the rewilding movement. The reintroduction of large predators is controversial, in part because of concern among farmers for their livestock. Conservationists such as Paul Lister propose instead to allow wolves and bears to hunt their prey in a \"managed environment\" on large fenced reserves.\n\n"}
{"id": "1872740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872740", "title": "Susan Edmonstone Ferrier", "text": "Susan Edmonstone Ferrier\n\nSusan Edmonstone Ferrier (7 September 1782 – 5 November 1854) was a Scottish novelist. Her novels, giving vivid accounts of Scottish life and presenting sharp views on women's education, remained popular throughout the 19th century.\n\nSusan Ferrier was the youngest daughter of Helen Coutts (1741–1797) (daughter of Robert Coutts, a farmer near Montrose) and James Ferrier (1744–1829), Writer to the Signet and one of the principal clerks of the Court of Session, in which office he was a colleague of Sir Walter Scott. Her father came from Linlithgow. She was probably born at Lady Stair's Close, Edinburgh, as the ninth of ten surviving children. The family moved in 1784 to 11 (now 25) George Street in the New Town.\n\nFerrier was privately educated. Through her family she came to know many notable Edinburgh people, including Sir Walter Scott and the novelist Henry Mackenzie. In 1797 her father took her in 1797 to Inveraray, home of his client and patron John Campbell, 5th Duke of Argyll. She became a friend of the family, especially of a granddaughter, Charlotte Clavering (died 1869), with whom she corresponded. Clavering was initially involved in the writing of Ferrier's first novel \"Marriage\", although in the end her contribution to it was limited to the section entitled 'The History of Mrs Douglas'. Some of the letters between Ferrier and Clavering can be found in the front matter of a six-volume edition of the novels.\n\nAfter her mother died Ferrier kept house for her father because her three older sisters were married. Like many well-to-do Edinburgh families, they took a house outside the city in the summer, East Morningside House, and while there she wrote \"The Inheritance\". Although she still wished her work to appear anonymously, her identity was widely known by then.\n\nIn 1811 Ferrier visited Walter Scott at Ashiestiel Farm and House on the banks of the River Tweed, near Clovenfords in the Scottish Borders, and again in 1829 and 1831 at his new house, Abbotsford. They enjoyed each other's company and he wrote of her: \"This gifted personage besides having great talents has conversation the least exigeant of any author, female at least..., simple, full of humour, and exceedingly ready at repartee, and all this without the least affectation of the blue stocking.\" He mentioned her in the same sentence as Maria Edgeworth and Frances Burney in 1825. Ferrier's account of the visits was eventually published posthumously in the magazine \"Temple Bar\" (1874).\n\nFerrier's own tastes in literature appear in her correspondence. She was an admirer of Jane Austen and of Scott (although she had reservations about some works of his), but scorned John Galt and John Gibson Lockhart. The last of several visits to London was paid in 1830 to see an oculist, when she stayed for a few days at the villa of Lord Casilis in Isleworth, the model for the house known as Woodlands in \"Destiny\".\n\nBrought up in the Church of Scotland, Ferrier joined the Free Church after the Disruption of 1843. She suffered from eye troubles and became reclusive in her old age. She died on 5 November 1854 at her brother's house at 38 Albany Street, Edinburgh, and was buried with her family in St Cuthbert's Churchyard. The grave lies on a main dividing wall immediately north of the church.\n\nFerrier's eldest brother married the sister of John Wilson, who wrote under the pseudonym Christopher North.\n\nFerrier wrote three novels. \"Marriage\" was written in 1810 but was much revised. It was published anonymously in 1818, by Edinburgh publisher William Blackwood. Blackwood paid £150 for the novel. Its success was remarkable, and it was translated into French and published in 1825.\n\nIn 1824 Blackwood was prepared to pay £1000 for the second novel, \"The Inheritance\", which according to 20th-century scholars, \"mixes sententious moralizing with detailed, wry, caustic observation of the 'thrice-told tale' of factors which make unions happy or unhappy.\" The third novel, \"Destiny\", was dedicated to Sir Walter Scott, who found that Robert Cadell of Edinburgh was willing to pay £1700 in 1831. \n\nIn 1841 she sold the copyright to the three novels to Richard Bentley, who reissued them in an illustrated edition with authorial revisions. In 1851 this edition was reprinted and for the first time Ferrier's name was included as the author. The library edition of 1881 and 1882 included a Memoir. \n\nA book-length memoir and correspondence appeared in 1898. Modern critical appraisals have been sparse, however in 1982 the National Library of Scotland produced a full catalogue of her works and life for an exhibition.\n\nHer novels, which combine humour with vivid accounts of Scottish social life and sharp views on marriage and female education, retained their popularity through the 19th-century. In the 20th-century their popularity began to wane, although editions of \"Marriage\" have appeared sporadically since the Second World War.\n\nAccording to an early 20th-century history of literature, \"In the novels of Susan Edmonstone Ferrier there is something of the rough sarcasm of Smollett, mingled with a strong didactic flavour and with occasional displays of sentiment that may be due to Mackenzie. To her personal friend Scott, she may have owed something in her studies of Scottish life, but Maria Edgeworth was her principal model.\" The book criticizes her works for loose plotting and \"coarse workmanship\", but praises her vigour and calls it \"fresh and interesting.\" \n\nIt has been argued recently that the three novels form a trilogy – an extended inquiry on the subjects of nation, history, and the evolution of female consciousness.\n\nIn December 2017, the Scottish author Val McDermid commented in The Observer newspaper that she hoped to revive the memory of Ferrier as Scotland's \"Jane Austen\".\n\n\n"}

Formerly Minister for Women, she served as Minister of State for Skills and Apprenticeships from 2017 until her resignation in July 2019. First elected as a Conservative, Milton had the Conservative whip removed on 3 September 2019 and subsequently sat as an independent politician. On 5 November 2019 Milton announced she had declined an offer to appeal the removal of the Conservative whip and would stand for re-election in the December 2019 general election as an independent politician, in which she lost to the Conservative Angela Richardson.\n\nAnne Frances Turner was born on 3 November 1955 in Sussex, England to Patrick and Nesta Turner. She attended Haywards Heath Grammar School in West Sussex. She trained as a nurse at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London and obtained a diploma in district nursing from the London South Bank University. Milton worked for the NHS for 25 years as a nurse which included working in primary care, research and supporting palliative care nurses. During the 1980s, she was a shop steward for the Royal College of Nursing.\n\nMilton was a councillor for the Borough of Reigate and Banstead from 1999 to 2004 and was Conservative Group leader on the council from 2000 to 2003 and a member of the South East England Regional Assembly. She applied to go on the Conservative Party's list of Parliamentary candidates in 1999 and was shortlisted in the selections for Bexhill and Battle and for Bridgwater but was not selected for a seat for the 2001 general election.\n\nMilton was selected to contest the Guildford parliamentary constituency in the 2005 general election, a seat which the Conservatives had unexpectedly lost in 2001 to the Liberal Democrat Sue Doughty with the constituency becoming a marginal. She was elected as the MP for Guildford at the 2005 general election with a margin of victory of 347 votes.\n\nAfter the election, she was appointed to the Health Select Committee serving till December 2006. During the 2005-2010 parliament, Milton worked as the Shadow Minister for Tourism from November 2006 and then the Shadow Minister for Health in July 2007. In February 2006, Milton was among a minority of Conservative MPs to oppose exceptions for private clubs from the proposed Smoking ban in England. Milton had previously announced her opposition to a partial ban, stating it was \"the worst possible solution\".\n\nMilton held her seat in the 2010 general election and increased her majority to 7,782 votes (14%). In July 2010, Milton suggested that doctors should describe obese patients as 'fat' to encourage them to take responsibility for their condition. This was criticised by campaigners who pointed out that a clinical definition was being replaced with a subjective, pejorative term.\n\nDuring the 2010-2015 parliament, she served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Department of Health, then, as a result of a ministerial reshuffle in September 2012, Milton was appointed a Government Whip (Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury), Vice-Chamberlain of the Household and later Treasurer of the Household. She abstained on the parliamentary vote on the legalisation of same sex marriage in February 2013 citing a lack of consensus amongst her constituents. In March 2015, she was appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom and therefore granted the title The Right Honourable. She voted for the United Kingdom to remain with the European Union (EU) in the June 2016 membership referendum. Milton was re-elected as MP for Guildford in the 2017 snap general election. After the election, she was selected as the Minister of State for Skills and Apprenticeships and the Minister for Women.\n\nOn 23 October 2018, Milton resigned from the Commons Reference Group on Representation and Inclusion, chaired by Commons speaker John Bercow, citing incompetence in Bercow's ability to tackle bullying and sexual harassment problems in Parliament.\n\nOn 23 July 2019, Milton resigned as Minister of State for Skills and Apprenticeships shortly before Boris Johnson was announced as the new leader of the Conservative Party and, thus, Prime Minister. She said that she could not serve in a government which said there was a possibility of the UK leaving the European Union with no deal.\n\nShe married Neil Milton in 1979 in Haywards Heath; the couple later divorced. Her current husband, Dr. Graham Henderson, whom she married in February 2000 in Surrey, is a former local medical director at Virgin Healthcare. Milton lives in Surrey and has four children, one of whom is yachtswoman Nikki Henderson.\n"}

It was named for the bridge of boats, or \"zeugma\", that crossed the Euphrates river at that location.\n\nZeugma was founded as Seleucia by Seleucus I Nicator in the early 3rd century BC on the site where he had the first bridge over the Euphrates built. In 64 BC, the Romans controlled the city. Zeugma was of great importance to the Romans as it was located at a strategically important place. Up to 70'000 people shall have lived in the city, and it became a center for the military and commerce for the Romans. In 253 AD, it was destroyed by the Sassanids, but was later rebuilt.\n\nIn late antiquity, Zeugma was a diocese, but the place seems to have been abandoned in the 7th century due to Persian and Arab raids.

{"id": "1872760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872760", "title": "Douglas Carswell", "text": "Douglas Carswell\n\nJohn Douglas Wilson Carswell (born 3 May 1971) is a British former Member of Parliament who in 2014 became the first elected MP for the UK Independence Party (UKIP), representing Clacton. From March 2017 to May 2017 (general election), he sat as an independent.\n\nAs a member of the Conservative Party, Carswell was elected as the MP for Harwich in 2005, and for Clacton in 2010. In August 2014, he changed his political allegiance to UKIP and announced his resignation as an MP. He stood in the subsequent by-election and was returned as a UKIP MP. He explained that he was joining UKIP out of a desire to see \"fundamental change in British politics\" and because he believed \"many of those at the top of the Conservative Party are simply not on our side. They aren't serious about the change that Britain so desperately needs.\" In 2016, Carswell admitted that he had \"jumped ship with the express goal of changing the image of UKIP and ensuring that it was an asset rather than a liability in the referendum campaign…to decontaminate the brand\". He left UKIP on 25 March 2017, to sit as an independent MP. He did not stand at the 2017 general election.\n\nCarswell is the son of two physicians. He lived in Uganda until his late teens. His father, Wilson Carswell, a respected Scottish doctor and Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, diagnosed the first confirmed Ugandan cases of HIV/AIDS in the early 1980s, and was one of a number of people engaged in drawing the world's attention to the unfolding pandemic. His father's experiences in Uganda were the inspiration for the character Dr Nicholas Garrigan in Giles Foden's novel \"The Last King of Scotland\". Carswell later attributed his libertarianism to his experiences of the \"arbitrary rule\" of Idi Amin.\n\nThe young Carswell was educated at two independent boarding schools for boys: St Andrews School in Turi in Kenya in East Africa, and Charterhouse in Godalming, Surrey, in southern England, followed by the University of East Anglia (UEA), where he was taught by Edward Acton, and graduated with an upper second-class honours bachelor's degree in history in 1993. He then attended King's College London, receiving a master's degree in British imperial history.\n\nCarswell worked as corporate development manager for television broadcasting in Italy from 1997 until 1999, and later for Invesco.\n\nAt the 2001 general election, Carswell contested Sedgefield, the constituency of Prime Minister Tony Blair, as the Conservative candidate. Blair's majority fell by 7,430 votes with Carswell effecting a swing of 4.7% to the Conservatives compared to 1997, against a national swing of 1.8%. In the months before the 2005 general election, Carswell worked in the Conservative Party's Policy Unit, then run by David Cameron.\n\nCarswell was elected to the House of Commons at the 2005 general election for the constituency of Harwich, defeating Ivan Henderson, the sitting Labour Member of Parliament (MP), by 920 votes. Carswell made his maiden speech on 28 June 2005 in the debate on the Identity Cards Bill. He was a member of Conservative Friends of Israel. Carswell served on the House of Commons' Education Select Committee and the Public Accounts Committee.\nIn 2008, Carswell took part in an Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme trip to Afghanistan, after which he called for more resources to be allocated to British troops serving there.\n\nIn April 2008, Carswell was reported to be launching plans for Speaker Michael Martin to be removed after the 2010 general election, saying that the Speaker had \"demonstrated that he is not the man to oversee the vital job of restoring faith in Westminster politics\".\nMartin later became the first Speaker in 314 years to resign after cross-party criticism of his handling of the MPs' expenses scandal.\n\nIn December 2009, Carswell tabled a Bill in the House of Commons calling for a public referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union (EU). \"The Daily Telegraph\" nominated him a Briton of the Year 2009, and \"Spectator\" readers voted him their choice as Parliamentarian of the Year in the same year. In February 2010, he asked Gus O'Donnell to suspend Cabinet meetings held outside London, when it was found that the government was using them to host Labour Party events in marginal seats.\n\nIn the new constituency of Clacton that was created from Harwich at the 2010 general election, Carswell increased his majority over Henderson to 12,068 votes. UKIP decided not to field a candidate against Carswell in the 2010 general election. Instead, the party actively campaigned in support of his re-election in view of his staunch anti-EU views.\n\nIn the first week of the new parliamentary session of the Conservative-led Government, Carswell revealed he intended to force a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon, over the need to resolve an oversight of apportionment in the European Parliament by re-ratifying the treaty.\n\nCarswell also strongly advocated for electoral reform, including the right for constituents to be able to recall MPs. The Recall of MPs Act 2015 later became law.\n\nOn 28 August 2014, Carswell defected from the Conservatives to UKIP. Although not required to do so, he resigned his seat as an MP, thus triggering a by-election. Less than a month before switching parties, Carswell had approved a letter from Conservative supporter Giles Watling to a local newspaper describing UKIP as a \"one policy party\" and saying \"a vote for Ukip will be a vote for Labour\". He later said he had been \"decidedly cool towards the sentiments of the letter.\"\n\nFollowing Carswell's resignation, Roger Lord, UKIP's nominated candidate for the 2015 general election, declared that he still wanted to stand, although the UKIP National Executive Committee voted to select Carswell. Two early opinion polls showed Carswell with a substantial lead. He was successful at the by-election on 9 October 2014, with a substantial majority of 12,404 votes over his nearest rival.\n\nCarswell later contrasted his willingness to put his switch of parties to the electorate to that of the eleven anti-Brexit MPs who switched to The Independent Group, none of whom held by-elections when changing parties. He noted \"When I changed parties it didn't occur to me to not hold a by election. If my own electorate weren't supportive, what was the point?\"\n\nAt the 2015 United Kingdom general election, Carswell won the seat of Clacton with a majority of 3,437 – down from a majority of 12,404 in the 2014 by-election. Carswell won UKIP's only seat in the general election.\n\nCarswell is a Eurosceptic, and supported Vote Leave – advocating leaving the EU – during the EU referendum in June 2016.\n\nIn March 2017, Carswell quit UKIP to become an independent MP for Clacton, leaving UKIP with no MPs in Parliament. On quitting the party he said, \"Now we can be certain that that <nowiki>[</nowiki>Brexit<nowiki>]</nowiki> is going to happen, I have decided that I will be leaving Ukip.\"\n\nOn 20 April 2017, following the announcement two days earlier by Prime Minister Theresa May of a snap UK general election, Carswell confirmed he would not be a candidate in the June election.\n\nHis relationship with then-UKIP party leader Nigel Farage was full of \"animosity\" and \"tension\"; on several occasions he called for Farage to step down as party leader. Farage called Carswell \"irrelevant\" in response to them supporting different campaigns to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum. In response to Carswell calling for the party leader's resignation, Farage said that Carswell should \"put up or shut up\", further saying that \"either he's going to have to accept that [UKIP is unified] or do something different\". After Farage's resignation as UKIP leader following the EU referendum, Carswell tweeted a \"sunshades smiley emoji\", which some parts of the media described as showing the \"uneasy relationship\" between the two men, Carswell later said to the BBC that \"I tweet smiley faces all the time, I'm very optimistic\". He also said that while Farage had \"played a role\" in the referendum, the resignation was \"a huge opportunity\" for the party. This happened a week after Farage suggested that Carswell could be kicked out of the party, saying that \"We find somebody inside our party who doesn't agree with anything the party stands for, it's a very odd state of affairs\".\n\nCarswell engaged in a Twitter argument with University of Sussex science policy professor Paul Nightingale, after Nightingale compared international trade to the effect that Jupiter and the moon have on the tides, saying \"Jupiter is big but the moon moves tides\". Carswell claimed that Nightingale was wrong, incorrectly replying \"Actually it's the gravitational pull of the sun. The moon's gravity does Spring/neap tides.\" In fact, the opposite is true.\n\nAfter being elected in 2005, Carswell originally designated a £1 million flat in London as his second home, and claimed over £21,000 for food, rent and furniture. In 2007 he began renting a house in Thorpe-le-Soken in Essex, which he designated his second home, and again paid a deposit and for furniture, including a £655 love seat, from his expenses (see Flipping § Second home flipping). Between 2007 and 2009 he claimed £32,000 in expenses for the house, commenting \"I believe this is entirely justified\". Following an investigation of the expenses of all MPs, Carswell was ordered to repay £2,159 in expenses.\n\nConservative Party commentator and \"Daily Telegraph\" columnist Charles Moore credits Carswell, together with MEP Daniel Hannan, as the architects behind the idea of a Great Repeal Bill, as well as the concept of a \"Contract with Britain\" offered during the election, the \"recall\" of MPs who have displeased their constituents, open primaries for the selection of parliamentary candidates, and plans for elected police commissioners. According to Moore's analysis not only is \"The localism of the Carswell/Hannan \"direct democracy\" movement is now good Coalition orthodoxy\", but Cameron's policy guru, Steve Hilton, \"enthusiastically lifted several bits of The Plan\", the best-selling moderniser book written by Carswell and co-author Daniel Hannan.\n\nEven before the formation of the Coalition, the influence of Carswell's ideas was evident in speeches made by David Cameron – most notably a speech to the Open University made by David Cameron in Milton Keynes in May 2009.\n\n\"New Statesman\" commentator Stephen Bush has argued that Carswell was correct to recognise that a successful Brexit campaign depended on its messages being associated with people other than Farage, but also observed that there \"is no electoral majority to be found Britain for the libertarian brand of conservatism that Carswell espouses\".\n\nBush also suggested that Carswell's ability to win his seat owed more to the appeal of his party to Clacton's voters than his own personal influence, observing that \"the evidence suggests that he has kept his seat thanks to the popularity of the party leaders he has consistently undermined and worked against\".\n\nDuring his time as a UKIP MP, Carswell, along with Mark Reckless and Stephen Crowther, established UKIP Parliamentary Resource Unit Limited.\n\nCarswell co-founded Disruptive, a data analytics company. Companies House filings show that Carswell resigned as a Director on 10 April 2019.\n\nCarswell was portrayed by actor Simon Paisley Day in the 2019 HBO- and Channel 4-produced drama \"\".\n\nCarswell and his wife Clementine have a daughter. Carswell's recreations include gardening, swimming, running, blogging, riding and making quince jelly.\n\n\n"}

She read Archaeology and Anthropology at Cambridge then studied for a postgraduate diploma in journalism at Cardiff University. She began her career as a reporter on the \"Bradford Telegraph and Argus\" in 1979. She was appointed assistant editor at Asia Television in Hong Kong in 1982. She returned to Britain in 1983 to become home news editor at the BBC. She left the BBC in 1995. She became a freelance video producer in 1998 before lecturing in video production at the Chichester College of Art and Design from 2000.\n\nShe was elected secretary of the Chelsea Constituency Labour Party in 1993, and became the chairman of the Chichester Constituency Labour Party in 1998. In 2000, she was selected to contest the safe Conservative seat of Chichester at the 2001 General Election and finished third, behind the winner Andrew Tyrie.\n\nIn November 2004 Ivor Caplin, the Labour MP for the very marginal Hove constituency, announced his retirement at the next election and Celia Barlow was chosen to fight the seat through a controversial All-Women Shortlist. It was widely assumed that she would be defeated by Nicholas Boles, considered a rising star of the Conservative Party, but she was elected at the 2005 General Election with a majority of just 420 votes. She became the first of the new MPs elected in 2005 to make their maiden speech in the House of Commons.\n\nBarlow was a member of the Procedure Committee and previously served on the Environmental Audit Select Committee.\n\nAfter May 2006 she served as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Ian Pearson, Economic Secretary in HM Treasury and Parliamentary Under-Secretary in the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. She is a member of parliamentary group EURIM.\n\nBarlow was defeated at the 2010 General Election by Conservative candidate Mike Weatherley.\n\nShe was one of many UK MPs to be implicated in the 2009 Expenses Scandal, claiming more than £28,000 in expenses on her second home, then 'flipping' it and using it as her main residence. The expense claims included the cost of a whirlpool bath and a high lustre silver shower screen Barlow later made political capital out of the fact she failed to claim for a second home in London.\n\nShe was also forced to repay £635 for a mortgage valuation on her main home; a breach of the expenses rules. She later offered to apologise for her expense claims.\n\nBarlow married the former BBC North America foreign correspondent and University of Hull-educated Sam Jaffa in August 1988 in Bromsgrove. Her husband stood for the Eastleigh seat in 2001 as a Labour candidate coming third. They have two sons and one daughter together. They divorced in 2011.\n\n"}

RKC has a 26-acre (105,000 m²) campus in Rajkot.\n\nThe foundation stone of Rajkumar College was laid in 1868. The institution was designed by Colonel Keatinge and was formally opened by the Governor of Bombay, H. B. Sir Seymour Fitzgerald, in 1870. The college was founded for the education of the princely order by the princes and chiefs of Kathiawad for their sons and relations.\n\nIn 1938, on the initiative of its founding members, the college became a public school (private school in American terms). The college is a founding member of the Indian Public Schools Conference and a member of the Round Square conference of schools, a worldwide association of more than 60 schools that allows students to travel between schools and tour the country or do community service.\n\nIn 2001 the college opened its doors to girls, in what has been a boys' bastion for over a century. The school has around 50 girls, with boarding facilities.\n\nAnother endeavor of the Rajkumar College Administration has been Priyalok Villas, a pre-school program for the kids; originally housed in a 1909 Hyde sanatorium but now housed in a different building.

{"id": "1872789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872789", "title": "James Earl Rudder", "text": "James Earl Rudder\n\nJames Earl Rudder (May 6, 1910 – March 23, 1970) was a United States Army Major General. As a Lieutenant Colonel he commanded the historic Pointe du Hoc battle during the Invasion of Normandy. He also commanded U.S. forces at the Battle of the Hurtgen wood and led a series of delaying actions and ambushes during the Battle of the Bulge. General Rudder also at various times served as Texas Land Commissioner, the 16th president of Texas A&M University, third president of the Texas A&M University System, mayor of Brady, Texas, and a high school and college teacher and coach.\n\nAfter graduation from Texas A&M, Rudder had been commissioned a second lieutenant of infantry in the United States Organized Reserve Corps. After being called into active duty in 1941, Rudder took part in the D-Day landings as commanding officer of the United States Army's 2nd Ranger Battalion.\n\nHis U.S. Army Rangers stormed the beach at Pointe du Hoc, scaling 100-foot (30-meter) cliffs under enemy fire to reach and destroy a German gun battery. The battalion's casualty rate for this perilous mission was greater than 50%. Rudder himself was wounded twice during the course of the fighting. Though there was fierce resistance the Germans had removed the main armament from Pointe du Hoc in April 1944, and secretly constructed Maisy battery as the main heavy artillery position in the sector which was left operational. In spite of this Rudder ordered his men to dig in and they fought off German counterattacks for two days until relieved. His men and he helped to successfully establish a beachhead for the Allied forces. The siege was replicated in the 1962 epic film \"The Longest Day\".\n\nSeven months later, Rudder was re-assigned in the middle of an assault to the 109th Infantry Regiment, which saw key service in the Battle of the Bulge. Rudder earned military honors including the Distinguished Service Cross, Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Cluster, Purple Heart with Oak Leaf Cluster, French Legion of Honor with Croix de Guerre and Palm, and Order of Leopold (Belgium) with Croix de Guerre and Palm. He was a full colonel by the war's end and was promoted to brigadier general of the United States Army Reserve in 1954 and major general in 1957.\n\nRudder served as mayor of Brady, Texas, for six years from 1946-52. In 1953, he became vice president of Brady Aviation Company. On January 1, 1955, he assumed the office of Texas Land Commissioner after James Bascom Giles abandoned the position. At that time, the Veterans Land Program was under scrutiny for mismanagement and corruption. Rudder undertook the task of reforming policies, expediting land applications, and closely supervising proper accounting procedures. He also oversaw the proper leasing of state lands by employing more field inspectors for oil and gas sites and adding a seismic exploration staff. In addition, he improved working conditions for his staff and instigated a program to preserve the many deteriorating General Land Office documents.\n\nRudder won the 1956 state land commissioner election as a Democrat. He became vice president of Texas A&M University in 1958 and was named its president in 1959. He was president of the entire A&M System from 1965 until his death in 1970. In 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson presented him with the Army Distinguished Service Medal, the Army's highest peacetime service award. Since his death in 1970, an annual service has been held in Normandy, France, in his honor.\n\nWhile president of Texas A&M, Rudder is credited for transforming it from a small, all-male land-grant college to the renowned university of today. Specifically, he made membership in the Corps of Cadets optional, allowed women to attend, and led efforts to integrate the campus. While the changes were hugely unpopular to the former students (it has been said only a president with Rudder's heroic military record could pull off such drastic changes), there is no doubt these changes freed Texas A&M to become the fourth-largest university in the United States. Many reminders of Rudder are on campus, including Rudder Tower, next to the Memorial Student Center. A special training unit within the Corps of Cadets known as \"Rudder's Rangers\" is named in his honor. Cadets within the Corps of Cadets at A&M are expected to be able to recite an excerpt from the inscription on Rudder tower, a \"Campusology\" that reads:\n\nRudder died on March 23, 1970, after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nThe Major General James E. Rudder Medal is awarded annually by the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) to an Army Reserve Soldier - serving or retired - whose career in the Army Reserve exemplifies the example of the Army Reserve Citizen-Soldier modeled by General Rudder.\n\n\n"}

It closed permanently in October 2011. A new facility, The Rio Tinto Alcan Planetarium, near Olympic Stadium in Montreal, opened in April 2013.\n\nThe planetarium was opened in advance of Expo 67 and inaugurated on April 1, 1966, by then-Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau. Its inaugural show, \"New Skies for a New City\", premiered on April 4, 1966. Work had commenced on the project more than three years before its launch, under the guidance of Dr. Pierre Gendron, a former professor of chemistry and founding Dean of the Faculty of Science at the University of Ottawa, who was an avid amateur astronomer. As president of the Board of Directors of Dow Breweries, Gendron convinced Dow to create a world-class planetarium in Montreal as part of the Canadian Centennial celebrations.\n\nThe architectural firm selected for the project was David-Barott-Boulva. The chosen design had an astronomical theme and the exterior of the dome resembled Saturn surrounded by its rings. The Planetarium was built at a cost of $1.2 million on the site of the historic Bonaventure Station on Chaboillez Square near Old Montreal.\n\nThe Planetarium produced more than 250 shows, was visited by nearly six million spectators and made more than 58,000 presentations in both French and English. The Planetarium was one of Montreal's most popular tourist attractions.\n\nOn October 10, 2011, the Dow Planetarium presented its final show.

{"id": "1872793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872793", "title": "EuroPride", "text": "EuroPride\n\nEuroPride is a pan-European international event dedicated to LGBTI pride, hosted by a different European city each year. The host city is usually one with an established pride event or a significant LGBTI community.\n\nFor up to a month, numerous sporting, artistic and human rights events are staged throughout the host city. EuroPride usually culminates during a weekend with a traditional Mardi Gras-style pride parade, live music, human rights conference, special club nights, and an AIDS memorial vigil.\n\nEuroPride was inaugurated in London in 1992, attended by estimated crowds of over 100,000. The following year, Berlin hosted the festivities. When Amsterdam hosted EuroPride in 1994, it turned into a financial disaster, leaving debts of approximately 450,000 euros. In 1996, EuroPride moved to Copenhagen, where it enjoyed strong support from city leaders. The organisers were successful on all fronts but not able to achieve a financial surplus.\n\nParis hosted EuroPride in 1997. The festival had numerous commercial sponsors and was widely hailed as a success. During the parade, over 300,000 people marched to the Bastille. Stockholm was the host city in 1998. London was to host EuroPride again in 1999, but the event was canceled when the organisers went bankrupt.\nIn 2000, WorldPride took place for the first time and, as has happened each time since, when WorldPride is in Europe, no separate EuroPride takes place. The event took place in Rome and was well-attended by LGBTI people from all over the world. After initially supporting the event, city leaders pulled their support just days before due to pressure exerted by the Vatican, which was organising its Great Jubilee.\n\nVienna hosted the 2001 EuroPride, drawing large crowds from Central Europe. In 2002, Köln (Cologne), Germany, held the then-biggest ever EuroPride; officials estimated crowds to number well over one million. EuroPride was hosted by Manchester in 2003, and Hamburg in 2004. Oslo hosted it in 2005, with Ian McKellen as the guest of honour.\n\nLondon hosted the event in 2006, organising a two-week festival culminating in a parade on the final day (1 July) in which marchers were invited to walk down Oxford Street, one of the city's busiest shopping streets, the first time they had been legally allowed to do so. The parade was attended by Mayor of London Ken Livingstone, Conservative MP Alan Duncan, human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, and the first transgender MEP, Italian Vladimir Luxuria.\n\nFollowing the parade, events were held in three of the capital's squares: a rally in Trafalgar Square addressed by Ian McKellen, and entertainment in Leicester and Soho Squares. EuroPride 2006 marked the first time that London's main pride rally and entertainment areas were staged within the city itself, rather than in open parks.\n\nIn 2007, Madrid hosted EuroPride, which took place in Chueca, the capital's gay village, during the last week in June. Madrid was chosen because of the gay marriage and gender identity laws Spain had passed during the previous two years. More than 1.2 million people attended the final parade as it passed through the downtown streets of Alcalá, and Gran Vía, ending up at Plaza de España. For the first time, Madrid City Hall contributed financing to the MADO (Madrid Orgullo) organisation. In addition, a private event, the Infinitamentegay Party, took place in Casa de Campo Park.\n\nIn 2008, the Stockholm Pride organization organised EuroPride for a second time, held from 25 June to 3 August in Stockholm, a decade after hosting EuroPride 1998.\n\nZurich hosted EuroPride in 2009 with a month-long roster of events from 2 May to 7 June, culminating in a parade through downtown Zurich on 6 June.\n\nThe 2010 event was held in Warsaw, Poland. Organisers prepared multifaceted events between July 9 to 18. The Parade took place on July 17. It marked the first time this pan-European LGBT celebration took place in a former communist country. The Warsaw EuroPride formulated, as its main theme, a demand for legalisation of \nsame sex civil partnerships.\n\nIn 2011, EuroPride returned to Rome. Hosted by Claudia Gerini, the parade closed with a performance and a speech by Lady Gaga at the Circus Maximus. That year one million people took part.\n\nThe 2013 EuroPride was in Marseille, France from July 10–20, focusing on gay marriage in France and celebrated the biggest gay wedding in Europe \n\nThe 2016 EuroPride returned to Amsterdam. UK singer/songwriter Tara McDonald sang her single \"I Need A Miracle\" which was chosen as the EuroPride anthem and was remixed by Gregor Salto.\n\nThere was no EuroPride in 2017 as WorldPride took place in Madrid.\n\nIn June 2019, President of Austria Alexander Van der Bellen became the first Head of State to address a EuroPride parade.\n\nThe European Pride Organisers Association, which licences EuroPride and owns the trademark, has decided that a World Pride event held in Europe also automatically carries the title of EuroPride.\n\nThe first World Pride was held in Rome in 2000 (see above). The second WorldPride was held in Jerusalem in 2005-2006.\n\nLondon, also hosting the 2012 Summer Olympics, beat out competing candidate, Stockholm, in the fall of 2008 to hold World Pride 2012, which was held from 23 June to 8 July.\n\nWorldPride 2017 was held in Madrid, and WorldPride 2021 will be held in Copenhagen, Denmark.\n\nMadrid's EuroPride 2007 was the most well-attended ever, with an estimated 2.5 million visitors. This huge attendance was not only a success for Madrid, but for the whole LGBT Spanish community, due to the celebration of the change of terms in the laws related to gay marriage and adoptions.\n\nMadrid was one of the first Spanish cities celebrating the legalization of gay marriage, with the support of all political parties, even the conservatives in the Government, headed by the ex-mayor of the city, Alberto Ruíz Gallardón from Partido Popular.\n\nDue to these and other advances in same-sex freedom and social progress, Madrid was chosen in 2012 to host WorldPride 2017.\n\nThe European Pride Organisers Association (often shortened to \"EPOA\" or \"EuroPride\") was founded in London in 1992 ahead of the first EuroPride. It owns the \"EuroPride\" trademark and licenses its use to one Pride organisation each year.\n\nEPOA is a small organisation with eight elected board members, all of whom serve with Pride organisations in Europe. It has no paid staff, and has its headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. The board meets several times each year, often holding a meeting in a city holding its Pride event that weekend.\n\nAny Pride organisation can become a member of EPOA upon payment of a membership fee. This gives the organisation voting rights at the Annual General Meeting, including on votes on future EuroPride bids. Membership to EPOA automatically makes a Pride a member of InterPride, its international equivalent. EPOA has more than 60 members across Europe.\n\nThe current President of EPOA is Latvian human rights activist, Kristine Garina.\n\n\n"}

He has been the Member of Parliament for Kettering since the 2005 general election.\n\nHollobone was born on 7 November 1964 in Bromley, Kent. He was privately educated at Dulwich College, where he was a contemporary of former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. He went on to study at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford where he was awarded a BA degree in Modern History and Economics. He was a prominent member of the Oxford University branch of the Monday Club - a 'hard right' pressure group that was later disassociated from the Conservative Party over its policies, such as the voluntary repatriation of ethnic minorities.\n\nIn 1984, he worked as a voluntary teacher in Honduras with a Baptist mission. He worked for various companies as an industry research analyst and investment banker between 1987 and 2003 and was in the Territorial Army between 1987 and 1995.\n\nHis elected political career began in the London Borough of Bromley, where he served as a councillor for the Martins Hill & Town ward between 1990 and 1994, when he did not stand again and the Liberal Democrat candidate won his former seat. He unsuccessfully contested Lewisham East at the 1997 General Election where he was defeated by the sitting Labour MP Bridget Prentice by 12,127 votes. In 1998 he sought re-election to the London Borough of Bromley in his former ward, but was defeated by the Liberal Democrats.\n\nHe was later selected as the Conservative candidate for the marginal Northamptonshire constituency of Kettering for the 2001 general election; he lost to incumbent Labour MP Phil Sawford by 665 votes. Following his defeat, Hollobone moved to Kettering and secured election in 2003 to Kettering Borough Council—first representing the rural ward of Buccleuch, before representing the suburban ward of Piper's Hill from 2007. He also became Vice Chairman of the Kettering Conservative Constituency Association in 2002. He was re-elected as a councillor in 2011, but did not re-stand in 2015.\n\nHollobone secured election to the House of Commons at his third attempt, during the 2005 general election, defeating Phil Sawford by 3,301 votes. He made his maiden speech on 24 May 2005.\n\nSome of his subsequent speeches were not well received. In 2006, he was one of three new MPs specifically mentioned in an article in \"The Times\" about manipulating the performance figures for the Theyworkforyou website. The article claimed new MPs boosted \"their ratings on the internet by saying very little, very often\". Whilst Hollobone's frequent \"speeches\" might give the appearance of \"Churchill or Gladstone\", many were interventions of only two or three sentences. In response, Hollobone said that as a new MP he tried to speak as often as possible on behalf of constituents and take part in many different debates.\n\nHollobone was rated as the Conservatives' most rebellious MP in 2010. He stated that his job is to \"represent constituents in Westminster, it's not to represent Westminster in the constituency\".\n\nHe has attempted to reintroduce national service. His private member's bill on capital punishment received its first reading in the House of Commons on 24 June 2013, but was withdrawn, and so did not receive a second reading. Similarly, his Young Offenders (Parental Responsibility) Bill, Foreign National Offenders (Exclusion from the United Kingdom) Bill, Fishing Grounds and Territorial Waters (Repatriation) Bill, Asylum Seekers (Return to Nearest Safe Country) Bill, BBC Licence Fee (Civil Debt) Bill and Equality and Diversity (Reform) Bill, all due for second reading on 28 February 2014, were all withdrawn. His European Communities Act 1972 (Repeal) Bill failed to progress to a vote.\n\nHe was re-elected at the 2010 general election, 2015 general election and 2017 general election.\n\nIn March 2015, Hollobone was criticised by \"The Independent\" for being one of just 4 MPs who voted against a Bill to increase the powers of the House of Lords to penalise peers who had broken the law and expel the worst offenders. This followed an expenses scandal relating to the former peer Lord Hanningfield. Hollobone argued the act could be used to discriminate against older male peers.\n\nIn January 2016, the Labour Party unsuccessfully proposed an amendment in Parliament that would have required private landlords to make their homes \"fit for human habitation\". According to Parliament's register of interests, Hollobone was one of 72 Conservative MPs who voted against the amendment who personally derived an income from renting out property. The Conservative Government had responded to the amendment that they believed homes should be fit for human habitation but did not want to pass the new law that would explicitly require it.\n\nIn February 2018, following the announcement that Northamptonshire County Council had brought in a \"section 114\" notice, putting it in special measures following a crises in its finances, Hollobone was one of seven local MPs who released a statement arguing that the problems with the authority were down to mismanagement from the Conservative councillors who led it rather than funding cuts from the Conservative Government. They further argued that government commissioners should take over the running of the Council.\n\nIn March 2018, he joined three other Conservative backbench MPs in \"talking out\" a bill by Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, which aimed to reverse moves to privatise the NHS. By filibustering for three-and-a-half hours, Lucas was left with just 17 minutes to present her bill, which was subsequently shelved without a vote.\n\nIn Parliament he serves on the Panel of Chairs, for which he receives an annual payment of £15,000 (in addition to his MP's salary of £77,379). He has previously been a member of the Transport Committee and the Backbench Business Committee.\n\nHollobone is regarded as being on the right wing of the Conservative Party, and is a member of the socially conservative Cornerstone Group. He has advocated the privatisation of both the NHS and the BBC and policies such as bringing back capital punishment and military conscription.\n\nIn 2013, Hollobone was one of four MPs who camped outside Parliament in a move to facilitate parliamentary debate on what they called an \"Alternative Queen’s Speech\" – an attempt to show what a future Conservative government might deliver. Some 42 policies were listed including reintroduction of the death penalty and conscription, privatising the BBC, banning the burka in public places and preparation to leave the European Union.\n\nHollobone was a supporter of the Better Off Out campaign, which campaigned for Britain's withdrawal from the EU. The Eurosceptic United Kingdom Independence Party did not field a candidate against Hollobone in the 2010 general election and subsequently campaigned for his re-election as a result of his Eurosceptic views. Hollobone continued to deny speculation that he would be the most likely MP to follow Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless in defecting to UKIP and remained a Conservative MP. UKIP did not field a candidate against him again in the 2017 general election.\n\nIn February 2010, Hollobone described the wearing of burqas as like \"going round wearing a paper bag over your head\" and expressed his \"huge sympathy\" with those calling for a ban on the garments. He went on to say that he would refuse to speak with constituents wearing burkas if they came to see him, although he did not cite any examples of where this had happened in the past and he was told he would face legal action if he was to do so. On 30 June 2010, Hollobone introduced the Face Coverings (Regulation) Bill, which would regulate the use of certain facial coverings, including the burka, in public. However, his bill did not progress further towards adoption.\n\nIn April 2009, Hollobone was reported to be the thriftiest Member of Parliament in terms of expenses: the average MP claimed £144,176 whereas Hollobone's expenses bill amounted to £47,737. In response to a written question by Hollobone, the expenses claimed for public duties by former Prime Ministers after they had left office was revealed to the public. In November 2017, Hollobone was reported to be the MP who had benefited from the largest sum of expenses that he was not entitled to, but had not been forced to pay the money back. The unjustified claim of £17,000 was written off because the expenses watchdog admitted that it should have picked up on the error earlier.\n\nHe married Donna Cooksey in St John's church, Cranford in June 2001.\nThey had a son named Thomas in June 2004 and a daughter named Emily in 2006 and lived in Barton Seagrave.

His father was a draper living in the Kensington Fields area of Liverpool.\n\nSilverman attended Liverpool Institute and the University of Liverpool, thanks to scholarships. During the First World War he was a conscientious objector to military service and served three prison sentences, in Preston, Wormwood Scrubs and Belfast prisons.\n\nSilverman was a lecturer in English at the National University of Finland from 1921 to 1925, and then returned to the University of Liverpool to read law. After qualifying as a solicitor he worked on workmen's compensation claims and landlord-tenant disputes.\n\nFrom 1932 to 1938 Silverman served on Liverpool City Council. He contested Liverpool Exchange without success at a by-election in 1933, but was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Nelson and Colne in the general election in 1935.\n\nSilverman was prominent in his support for Jews worldwide and for their rights in Palestine. He rethought his pacifism in light of the reports of antisemitism in Europe, and reluctantly supported Britain's entry into the Second World War. He was vocal in asking from the government (and Churchill in particular) for a statement of war aims, which had become a contentious issue in the early years of the war. Silverman was prominent within the debates over the potential repatriation of Jewish refugees, telling Churchill 'that it would be difficult to conceive of a more cruel procedure than to take people who have lost everything they have – their homes, their relatives, their children, all the things that make life decent and possible – and compel them against their will, to go back to the scene of those crimes'.\n\nSilverman was widely expected to join the government after the Labour victory in the general election in 1945, but, as he was a leftist, he was not appointed by Clement Attlee. He became opposed to the government's foreign policy. He refused to support German rearmament in 1954 and had the Labour Party Whip withdrawn from November 1954 to April 1955. He was one of the founders of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. In 1961, as a protest against bipartisan support for British nuclear weapons, he voted against the Royal Air Force, Royal Navy and British Army estimates in the House of Commons, and was suspended from the Labour Party Whip from March 1961 until May 1963.\n\nSilverman died on 9 February 1968 following a stroke.\n\nA fervent opponent of the death penalty, Silverman founded the National Campaign for the Abolition of Capital Punishment. He wrote about several miscarriages of justice in the 1940s and 1950s, such as the hanging of Timothy Evans when it later emerged that serial killer John Christie had murdered Evans' wife and had given perjured evidence at Evans' trial in 1949. Silverman proposed a private member's bill on abolition of the death penalty, which was passed by 200 votes to 98 on a free vote in the House of Commons on 28 June 1956; but was defeated in the House of Lords.\n\nIn 1965, he successfully piloted the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill through Parliament, abolishing capital punishment for murder in the UK and in the British Armed Forces for a period of five years but with provision for abolition to be made permanent by affirmative resolutions of both Houses of Parliament before the end of that period. The appropriate resolutions were passed in 1969. Silverman was opposed at the 1966 general election in the Nelson and Colne constituency by Patrick Downey, the uncle of Lesley Anne Downey, a victim in the Moors murders case, who stood on an explicitly pro-hanging platform. Downey polled over 5,000 votes, 13.7%, then the largest vote for a genuinely independent candidate since 1945.\n\n\n"}

She has served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Llanelli since 2005.\n\nShe held the position of Shadow Secretary of State for Wales, having been appointed to the post by Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn in September 2015 until she resigned in June 2016. On 6 October 2016, Corbyn appointed Griffith as Shadow Secretary of State for Defence, replacing Clive Lewis.\n\nGriffith was born in Dublin, Republic of Ireland, on 4 December 1956. Her family comes from mining villages near Neath, in South Wales. Her mother was born in Neath. Her father was Professor Thomas Gwynfor Griffith; her mother was Dr. Rhiannon Howell.\n\nShe was educated at Newland High School for Girls (now called Newland School for Girls) in Hull and Somerville College, Oxford where she graduated with a first class degree in modern languages in 1979. After Oxford, she trained to be a teacher (PGCE) at the University of Wales, Bangor.\n\nGriffith became a teacher at Queen Elizabeth Cambria School in Carmarthen then Gowerton Comprehensive School in Swansea. She was a member of the NUT. Prior to entering Parliament, she was an education adviser and an Estyn Schools Inspector (the Welsh equivalent of Ofsted) from 1992. Immediately before becoming an MP she was Head of Languages at Morriston Comprehensive School, Swansea. She speaks five languages: English, Welsh, Italian, French and Spanish and has written a book on language teaching.\n\nGriffith was a founder member of a local Women's Aid organisation and is a member of the National Union of Teachers and the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers.\n\nGriffith joined the Labour Party in 1981 and has held many posts of responsibility within the party, including Secretary of the Carmarthenshire County Labour Party. She was elected as a councillor to the Carmarthen Town Council in 1987, serving as the sheriff in 1997 and deputy mayor in 1998.\n\nShe was selected to contest the Welsh seat of Llanelli for Labour at the 2005 General Election following the imposition of an all-women shortlist after the retirement of Denzil Davies. She won the seat with a majority of 7,234 votes and remains the MP there. Griffith made her maiden speech on 19 May 2005. She was a member of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, Welsh Affairs Select Committee and European Scrutiny Committee. She also chaired the All-Party Steel and Metals Group. Griffith was PPS to Harriet Harman MP in her capacity as Minister for Women and Equality before the 2010 general election.\n\nGriffith was re-elected in 2010 with her majority reduced by 2,533 votes. In October 2010, she became Shadow Minister for Business, Innovation and Skills until October 2011 when she became Shadow Minister for Wales. On 13 September 2015 she became Shadow Secretary of State for Wales. She resigned from this position on 27 June 2016 following a series of other resignations from Jeremy Corbyn's Shadow Cabinet, but was appointed Shadow Defence Secretary four months later. She supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election.\n\nHer main political interests are tackling climate change and issues affecting industry. She has been Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Modern Languages since 2015.\n\nShe is a member of Labour Friends of Israel.\n\nGriffith held her seat at the 2019 general election.\n\nOn 6th April 2020, she was appointed by Keir Starmer to be Shadow Secretary of State for Wales, one of only a few MPs to continue from Jeremy Corbyn's Shadow Cabinet.\nIn June 2009, Griffith was named as one of the Welsh MPs whose expenses had been overpaid. Following a review of expenses Sir Thomas Legg ordered Griffith to repay £4,099.77 in mortgage interest claims.\n\nIn June 2010, Griffith had to repay the cost of sending 71 letters having been found to have breached Parliamentary rules on using House of Commons stationery for political purposes. The Department of Resources ruled that the letters, sent out just before the general election, \"sought to communicate information about the Labour Party and that its intention was to persuade constituents to vote accordingly for the sitting party member\". Griffith also apologised for her actions.\n\nGriffith is divorced, her former husband was a social worker. In a photo shoot for \"The Independent\" in February 2016, Griffith came out as lesbian, commenting that her sexuality had been known among friends, family and colleagues since the mid-1990s. She was named on the 2017 Pinc List of leading Welsh LGBT figures.\n\nGriffith owns a house in Llanelli, a flat in London, and a smallholding in Carmarthenshire which received Tir Gofal funding.

Cylinder and wheel dimensions were identical.\n\nThe class was originally designed by Peter Drummond, whose elder (and better known) brother Dugald had been in the company's locomotive department in earlier years and was at that time Chief Mechanical Engineer of the London and South Western Railway.\n\nIn appearance they were fairly typical Drummond family products with the stiffener across the cab roof.

The last of these, 54398 \"Ben Alder\", was withdrawn in 1953 and placed in storage in the hope that it would be preserved.\n\nUnfortunately the hopes for 54398 – which included the intention to restore the locomotive to Highland Railway condition – came to nothing, and following storage at various locations (including Boat of Garten) it was eventually cut up in 1967; and so, none were preserved. However, a charitable organisation has been formed with the aim of building a working replica of 54398 Ben Alder. \n\n\n"}

Since 2005, he has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Ludlow constituency in Shropshire.\n\nHe has been a farmer since 1987, at his family's farm just over the county boundary in Herefordshire, at Leintwardine near Ludlow, and was elected in 2001 as a councillor on the South Shropshire District Council, of which he was the Conservative leader in 2003–2005. He was also secretary of the Ludlow Conservative Association for a year in 2001..\n\nPhilip Dunne was born in Ludlow, Shropshire, and has an ancestry of politicians and courtiers. He is the son of Sir Thomas Dunne KG, the former Lord Lieutenant of Herefordshire and Worcestershire, who in turn is the son of Philip Russell Rendel Dunne (who briefly sat in the Commons), who in turn was the son of Edward Marten Dunne (who also sat in the Commons). Philip Dunne was educated at Abberley Hall School, followed by Eton College and Keble College, Oxford, where he was awarded a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics. At Oxford he was part of the Bullingdon Club.\n\nHe was elected to the House of Commons at the 2005 general election for Ludlow when he unseated the incumbent Liberal Democrat MP, Matthew Green. Dunne regained the (historically safe) seat for the Conservatives; the seat having been lost at the 2001 general election. He made his maiden speech on 8 June 2005. During his first term in Parliament (2005–2010) he was a member of the Work and Pensions Select committee, and in 2006 he was appointed to the Public Accounts Committee.\n\nPhilip Dunne held the Ludlow constituency seat in the 2010 general election with a notable swing from the Liberal Democrats, giving Dunne a 52.8 per cent share of the vote and a new, strengthened majority of 9,749. In the 2015 general election Dunne again increased his share of the vote and substantially increased his majority.\n\nIn July 2016, he was appointed as Minister for State for Health. In Prime Minister Theresa May's January 2018 reshuffle, he was dismissed from his ministerial post. Before losing his post, Dunne was accused of belittling the winter NHS bed crisis by suggesting unwell people in accident and emergency departments of hospitals without beds could instead use seats.\n\nJust before the Conservative leadership election of 2005, he balloted his constituents about whom he should vote for in the contest. After this ballot Dunne announced that he would be supporting David Cameron; he was also Chairman of Cameron's campaign in Shropshire.\n\nFollowing the formation of the Liberal Democrat–Conservative coalition government shortly after the general election, Philip Dunne was appointed as an unpaid assistant government whip in the House of Commons. In September 2012, he was appointed Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology with responsibility for defence procurement and defence exports. In this role, he was the minister responsible for, and one of the backers of, the bill which became the Defence Reform Act 2014. He was appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in the 2019 New Years Honours List, giving him the honorific title \"The Right Honourable\".\n\nIn the 2019 leadership election, Dunne managed Jeremy Hunt's campaign.\n\nAt a hustings held in Church Stretton he allegedly told the Labour candidate, Kuldip Sahota, that he was \"talking through his turban\".\n\nHe is married to Domenica and they have two sons and two daughters.

The more rural ridings of Saint-Jean, Verchères—Les-Patriotes and Chambly—Borduas are Bloquist strongholds. Vaudreuil-Soulanges, west of Montreal, has a significant Anglophone population and can usually be expected to vote Liberal—its 2004 fall to the BQ on election night was one of the biggest surprises on election night. The fallout from the sponsorship scandal allowed the Bloc to sweep the region in 2006 for the first time, although the Liberals regained the traditional Liberal seat of Brossard-La Prairie in 2008, albeit on a judicial recount.

{"id": "1872854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872854", "title": "Biochemical cascade", "text": "Biochemical cascade\n\nA biochemical cascade, also known as a signaling cascade or signaling pathway, is a series of chemical reactions that occur within a biological cell when initiated by a stimulus. This stimulus, known as a first messenger, acts on a receptor that is transduced to the cell interior through second messengers which amplify the signal and transfer it to effector molecules, causing the cell to respond to the initial stimulus. Most biochemical cascades are series of events, in which one event triggers the next, in a linear fashion. At each step of the signaling cascade, various controlling factors are involved to regulate cellular actions, in order to respond effectively to cues about their changing internal and external environments.\n\nAn example would be the coagulation cascade of secondary hemostasis which leads to fibrin formation, and thus, the initiation of blood coagulation. Another example, sonic hedgehog signaling pathway, is one of the key regulators of embryonic development and is present in all bilaterians. Signaling proteins give cells information to make the embryo develop properly. When the pathway malfunctions, it can result in diseases like basal cell carcinoma. Recent studies point to the role of hedgehog signaling in regulating adult stem cells involved in maintenance and regeneration of adult tissues. The pathway has also been implicated in the development of some cancers. Drugs that specifically target hedgehog signaling to fight diseases are being actively developed by a number of pharmaceutical companies.\n\nCells require a full and functional cellular machinery to live. When they belong to complex multicellular organisms, they need to communicate among themselves and work for symbiosis in order to give life to the organism. These communications between cells triggers intracellular signaling cascades, termed signal transduction pathways, that regulate specific cellular functions. Each signal transduction occurs with a primary extracellular messenger that binds to a transmembrane or nuclear receptor, initiating intracellular signals. The complex formed produces or releases second messengers that integrate and adapt the signal, amplifying it, by activating molecular targets, which in turn trigger effectors that will lead to the desired cellular response.\n\nSignal transduction is realized by activation of specific receptors and consequent production/delivery of second messengers, such as Ca or cAMP. These molecules operate as signal transducers, triggering intracellular cascades and in turn amplifying the initial signal.\nTwo main signal transduction mechanisms have been identified, via nuclear receptors, or via transmembrane receptors. In the first one, first messenger cross through the cell membrane, binding and activating intracellular receptors localized at nucleus or cytosol, which then act as transcriptional factors regulating directly gene expression. This is possible due to the lipophilic nature of those ligands, mainly hormones. In the signal transduction via transmembrane receptors, first messenger bind to the extracellular domain of transmembrane receptor activating it. This receptors may have intrinsic catalytic activity or may be coupled to effector enzymes, or may also be associated to ionic channels. Therefore, there are four main transmembrane receptor types: G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs), serine/threonine kinase receptors (RSTKs), and ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs).\nSecond messengers can be classified into three classes: \n\nThe cellular response in signal transduction cascades involves alteration of the expression of effector genes or activation/inhibition of targeted proteins. Regulation of protein activity mainly involves phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events, leading to its activation or inhibition. It is the case for the vast majority of responses as a consequence of the binding of the primary messengers to membrane receptors. This response is quick, as it involves regulation of molecules that are already present in the cell. On the other hand, the induction or repression of the expression of genes requires the binding of transcriptional factors to the regulatory sequences of these genes. The transcriptional factors are activated by the primary messengers, in most cases, due to their function as nuclear receptors for these messengers. The secondary messengers like DAG or Ca could also induce or repress gene expression, via transcriptional factors. This response is slower than the first because it involves more steps, like transcription of genes and then the effect of newly formed proteins in a specific target. The target could be a protein or another gene.\n\nIn biochemistry, several important enzymatic cascades and signal transduction cascades participate in metabolic pathways or signaling networks, in which enzymes are usually involved to catalyze the reactions. For example, the tissue factor pathway in the coagulation cascade of secondary hemostasis is the primary pathway leading to fibrin formation, and thus, the initiation of blood coagulation. The pathways are a series of reactions, in which a zymogen (inactive enzyme precursor) of a serine protease and its glycoprotein co-factors are activated to become active components that then catalyze the next reaction in the cascade, ultimately resulting in cross-linked fibrin.\n\nAnother example, sonic hedgehog signaling pathway, is one of the key regulators of embryonic development and is present in all bilaterians. Different parts of the embryo have different concentrations of hedgehog signaling proteins, which give cells information to make the embryo develop properly and correctly into a head or a tail. When the pathway malfunctions, it can result in diseases like basal cell carcinoma. Recent studies point to the role of hedgehog signaling in regulating adult stem cells involved in maintenance and regeneration of adult tissues. The pathway has also been implicated in the development of some cancers. Drugs that specifically target hedgehog signaling to fight diseases are being actively developed by a number of pharmaceutical companies. Most biochemical cascades are series of events, in which one event triggers the next, in a linear fashion.\n\nBiochemical cascades include: \n\nConversely, negative cascades include events that are in a circular fashion, or can cause or be caused by multiple events. Negative cascades include:\n\nAdhesion is an essential process to epithelial cells so that epithelium can be formed and cells can be in permanent contact with extracellular matrix and other cells. Several pathways exist to accomplish this communication and adhesion with environment. But the main signalling pathways are the cadherin and integrin pathways.\nThe cadherin pathway is present in adhesion junctions or in desmosomes and it is responsible for epithelial adhesion and communication with adjacent cells. Cadherin is a transmembrane glycoprotein receptor that establishes contact with another cadherin present in the surface of a neighbour cell forming an adhesion complex. This adhesion complex is formed by β-catenin and α-catenin, and p120 is essential for its stabilization and regulation. This complex then binds to actin, leading to polymerization. For actin polymerization through the cadherin pathway, proteins of the Rho GTPases family are also involved. This complex is regulated by phosphorylation, which leads to downregulation of adhesion. Several factors can induce the phosphorylation, like EGF, HGF or v-Src. The cadherin pathway also has an important function in survival and proliferation because it regulates the concentration of cytoplasmic β-catenin. When β-catenin is free in the cytoplasm, normally it is degraded, however if the Wnt signalling is activated, β-catenin degradation is inhibited and it is translocated to the nucleus where it forms a complex with transcription factors. This leads to activation of genes responsible for cell proliferation and survival. So the cadherin-catenin complex is essential for cell fate regulation. \nIntegrins are heterodimeric glycoprotein receptors that recognize proteins present in the extracellular matrix, like fibronectin and laminin. In order to function, integrins have to form complexes with ILK and Fak proteins. For adhesion to the extracellular matrix, ILK activate the Rac and Cdc42 proteins and leading to actin polymerization. ERK also leads to actin polymerization through activation of cPLA2. Recruitment of FAK by integrin leads to Akt activation and this inhibits pro-apoptotic factors like BAD and Bax. When adhesion through integrins do not occur the pro-apoptotic factors are not inhibited and resulting in apoptosis.\n\nThe hepatocyte is a complex and multifunctional differentiated cell whose cell response will be influenced by the zone in hepatic lobule, because concentrations of oxygen and toxic substances present in the hepatic sinusoids change from periportal zone to centrilobular zone10. The hepatocytes of the intermediate zone have the appropriate morphological and functional features since they have the environment with average concentrations of oxygen and other substances. \nThis specialized cell is capable of:\nThe hepatocyte also regulates other functions for constitutive synthesis of proteins (albumin, ALT and AST) that influences the synthesis or activation of other molecules (synthesis of urea and essential amino acids), activate vitamin D, utilization of vitamin K, transporter expression of vitamin A and conversion of thyroxine.\n\nPurinergic signalling has an essential role at interactions between neurons and glia cells, allowing these to detect action potentials and modulate neuronal activity, contributing for intra and extracellular homeostasis regulation. Besides purinergic neurotransmitter, ATP acts as a trophic factor at cellular development and growth, being involved on microglia activation and migration, and also on axonal myelination by oligodendrocytes. There are two main types of purinergic receptors, P1 binding to adenosine, and P2 binding to ATP or ADP, presenting different signalling cascades.\nThe Nrf2/ARE signalling pathway has a fundamental role at fighting against oxidative stress, to which neurons are especially vulnerable due to its high oxygen consumption and high lipid content. This neuroprotective pathway involves control of neuronal activity by perisynaptic astrocytes and neuronal glutamate release, with the establishment of tripartite synapses. The Nrf2/ARE activation leads to a higher expression of enzymes involved in glutathione syntheses and metabolism, that have a key role in antioxidant response.\nThe LKB1/NUAK1 signalling pathway regulates terminal axon branching at cortical neurons, via local immobilized mitochondria capture. Besides NUAK1, LKB1 kinase acts under other effectors enzymes as SAD-A/B and MARK, therefore regulating neuronal polarization and axonal growth, respectively. These kinase cascades implicates also Tau and others MAP.\nAn extended knowledge of these and others neuronal pathways could provide new potential therapeutic targets for several neurodegenerative chronic diseases as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, and also amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n\nThe blood cells (erythrocytes, leukocytes and platelets) are produced by hematopoiesis.\nThe erythrocytes have as main function the O delivery to the tissues, and this transfer occurs by diffusion and is determined by the O tension (PO). The erythrocyte is able to feel the tissue need for O and cause a change in vascular caliber, through the pathway of ATP release, which requires an increase in cAMP, and are regulated by the phosphodiesterase (PDE). This pathway can be triggered via two mechanisms: physiological stimulus (like reduced O2 tension) and activation of the prostacyclin receptor (IPR). This pathway includes heterotrimeric G proteins, adenylyl cyclase (AC), protein kinase A (PKA), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and a final conduit that transport ATP to vascular lumen (pannexin 1 or voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC)). The released ATP acts on purinergic receptors on endothelial cells, triggering the synthesis and release of several vasodilators, like nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI). \nThe current model of leukocyte adhesion cascade includes many steps mentioned in Table 1. The integrin-mediated adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells is related with morphological changes in both leukocytes and endothelial cells, which together support leukocyte migration through the venular walls. Rho and Ras small GTPases are involved in the principal leukocyte signaling pathways underlying chemokine-stimulated integrin-dependent adhesion, and have important roles in regulating cell shape, adhesion and motility.\nAfter a vascular injury occurs, platelets are activated by locally exposed collagen (glycoprotein (GP) VI receptor), locally generated thrombin (PAR1 and PAR4 receptors), platelet-derived thromboxane A2 (TxA2) (TP receptor) and ADP (P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptors) that is either released from damaged cells or secreted from platelet dense granules. The von Willebrand factor (VWF) serves as an essential accessory molecule. In general terms, platelet activation initiated by agonist takes to a signaling cascade that leads to an increase of the cytosolic calcium concentration. Consequently, the integrin αβ is activated and the binding to fibrinogen allows the aggregation of platelets to each other. The increase of cytosolic calcium also leads to shape change and TxA2 synthesis, leading to signal amplification.\n\nThe main goal of biochemical cascades in lymphocytes is the secretion of molecules that can suppress altered cells or eliminate pathogenic agents, through proliferation, differentiation and activation of these cells. Therefore, the antigenic receptors play a central role in signal transduction in lymphocytes, because when antigens interact with them lead to a cascade of signal events. These receptors, that recognize the antigen soluble (B cells) or linked to a molecule on Antigen Presenting Cells (T cells), do not have long cytoplasm tails, so they are anchored to signal proteins, which contain a long cytoplasmic tails with a motif that can be phosphorylated (ITAM – immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif) and resulting in different signal pathways. The antigen receptor and signal protein form a stable complex, named BCR or TCR, in B or T cells, respectively. The family Src is essential for signal transduction in these cells, because it is responsible for phosphorylation of ITAMs. Therefore, Lyn and Lck, in lymphocytes B and T, respectively, phosphorylate immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs after the antigen recognition and the conformational change of the receptor, which leads to the binding of Syk/Zap-70 kinases to ITAM and its activation. Syk kinase is specific of lymphocytes B and Zap-70 is present in T cells. After activation of these enzymes, some adaptor proteins are phosphorylated, like BLNK (B cells) and LAT (T cells). These proteins after phosphorylation become activated and allow binding of others enzymes that continue the biochemical cascade. One example of a protein that binds to adaptor proteins and become activated is PLC that is very important in the lymphocyte signal pathways. PLC is responsible for PKC activation, via DAG and Ca, which leads to phosphorylation of CARMA1 molecule, and formation of CBM complex. This complex activates Iκκ kinase, which phosphorylates I-κB, and then allows the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus and transcription of genes encoding cytokines, for example. Others transcriptional factors like NFAT and AP1 complex are also important for transcription of cytokines. The differentiation of B cells to plasma cells is also an example of a signal mechanism in lymphocytes, induced by a cytokine receptor. In this case, some interleukins bind to a specific receptor, which leads to activation of MAPK/ERK pathway. Consequently, the BLIMP1 protein is translated and inhibits PAX5, allowing immunoglobulin genes transcription and activation of XBP1 (important for the secretory apparatus formation and enhancing of protein synthesis). Also, the coreceptors (CD28/CD19) play an important role because they can improve the antigen/receptor binding and initiate parallel cascade events, like activation o PI3 Kinase. PIP3 then is responsible for activation of several proteins, like vav (leads to activation of JNK pathway, which consequently leads to activation of c-Jun) and btk (can also activate PLC).\n\nThe Wnt signaling pathway can be divided in canonical and non-canonical. The canonical signaling involves binding of Wnt to Frizzled and LRP5 co-receptor, leading to GSK3 phosphorylation and inhibition of β-catenin degradation, resulting in its accumulation and translocation to the nucleus, where it acts as a transcription factor. The non-canonical Wnt signaling can be divided in planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway and Wnt/calcium pathway. It is characterized by binding of Wnt to Frizzled and activation of G proteins and to an increase of intracellular levels of calcium through mechanisms involving PKC 50. The Wnt signaling pathway plays a significative role in osteoblastogenesis and bone formation, inducing the differentiation of mesenquimal pluripotent cells in osteoblasts and inhibiting the RANKL/RANK pathway and osteoclastogenesis.\n\nRANKL is a member of the TNF superfamily of ligands. Through binding to the RANK receptor it activates various molecules, like NF-kappa B, MAPK, NFAT and PI3K52. The RANKL/RANK signaling pathway regulates osteoclastogenesis, as well as, the survival and activation of osteoclasts.\n\nAdenosine is very relevant in bone metabolism, as it plays a role in formation and activation of both osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Adenosine acts by binding to purinergic receptors and influencing adenylyl cyclase activity and the formation of cAMP and PKA 54. Adenosine may have opposite effects on bone metabolism, because while certain purinergic receptors stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity, others have the opposite effect. Under certain circumstances adenosine stimulates bone destruction and in other situations it promotes bone formation, depending on the purinergic receptor that is being activated.\n\nSelf-renewal and differentiation abilities are exceptional properties of stem cells. These cells can be classified by their differentiation capacity, which progressively decrease with development, in totipotents, pluripotents, multipotents and unipotents.\n\nSelf-renewal process is highly regulated from cell cycle and genetic transcription control. There are some signaling pathways, such as LIF/JAK/STAT3 (Leukemia inhibitory factor/Janus kinase/Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) and BMP/SMADs/Id (Bone morphogenetic proteins/ Mothers against decapentaplegic/ Inhibitor of differentiation), mediated by transcription factors, epigenetic regulators and others components, and they are responsible for self-renewal genes expression and inhibition of differentiation genes expression, respectively.\n\nAt cell cycle level there is an increase of complexity of the mechanisms in somatic stem cells. However, it is observed a decrease of self-renewal potential with age. These mechanisms are regulated by p16-CDK4/6-Rb and p19-p53-P21 signaling pathways. Embryonic stem cells have constitutive cyclin E-CDK2 activity, which hyperphosphorylates and inactivates Rb. This leads to a short G1 phase of the cell cycle with rapid G1-S transition and little dependence on mitogenic signals or D cyclins for S phase entry. In fetal stem cells, mitogens promote a relatively rapid G1-S transition through cooperative action of cyclin D-CDK4/6 and cyclin E-CDK2 to inactivate Rb family proteins. p16 and p19 expression are inhibited by Hmga2-dependent chromatin regulation. Many young adult stem cells are quiescent most of the time. In the absence of mitogenic signals, cyclin-CDKs and the G1-S transition are suppressed by cell cycle inhibitors including Ink4 and Cip/Kip family proteins. As a result, Rb is hypophosphorylated and inhibits E2F, promoting quiescence in G0-phase of the cell cycle. Mitogen stimulation mobilizes these cells into cycle by activating cyclin D expression. In old adult stem cells, let-7 microRNA expression increases, reducing Hmga2 levels and increasing p16 and p19 levels. This reduces the sensitivity of stem cells to mitogenic signals by inhibiting cyclin-CDK complexes. As a result, either stem cells cannot enter the cell cycle, or cell division slows in many tissues.\n\nExtrinsic regulation is made by signals from the niche, where stem cells are found, which is able to promote quiescent state and cell cycle activation in somatic stem cells. Asymmetric division is characteristic of somatic stem cells, maintaining the reservoir of stem cells in the tissue and production of specialized cells of the same.\n\nStem cells show an elevated therapeutic potential, mainly in hemato-oncologic pathologies, such as leukemia and lymphomas. Little groups of stem cells were found into tumours, calling cancer stem cells. There are evidences that these cells promote tumor growth and metastasis.\n\nThe oocyte is the female cell involved in reproduction. There is a close relationship between the oocyte and the surrounding follicular cells which is crucial to the development of both. GDF9 and BMP15 produced by the oocyte bind to BMPR2 receptors on follicular cells activating SMADs 2/3, ensuring follicular development. Concomitantly, oocyte growth is initiated by binding of KITL to its receptor KIT in the oocyte, leading to the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway, allowing oocyte survival and development. During embryogenesis, oocytes initiate meiosis and stop in prophase I. This arrest is maintained by elevated levels of cAMP within the oocyte. It was recently suggested that cGMP cooperates with cAMP to maintain the cell cycle arrest. During meiotic maturation, the LH peak that precedes ovulation activates MAPK pathway leading to gap junction disruption and breakdown of communication between the oocyte and the follicular cells. PDE3A is activated and degrades cAMP, leading to cell cycle progression and oocyte maturation. The LH surge also leads to the production of progesterone and prostaglandins that induce the expression of ADAMTS1 and other proteases, as well as their inhibitors. This will lead to degradation of the follicular wall, but limiting the damage and ensuring that the rupture occurs in the appropriate location, releasing the oocyte into the Fallopian tubes. Oocyte activation depends on fertilization by sperm. It is initiated with sperm's attraction induced by prostaglandins produced by the oocyte, which will create a gradient that will influence the sperm's direction and velocity. After fusion with the oocyte, PLC ζ of the spermatozoa is released into the oocyte leading to an increase in Ca2+ levels that will activate CaMKII which will degrade MPF, leading to the resumption of meiosis. The increased Ca levels will induce the exocytosis of cortical granules that degrade ZP receptors, used by sperm to penetrate the oocyte, blocking polyspermy. Deregulation of these pathways will lead to several diseases like, oocyte maturation failure syndrome which results in infertility. Increasing our molecular knowledge of oocyte development mechanisms could improve the outcome of assisted reproduction procedures, facilitating conception.\n\nSpermatozoon is the male gamete. After ejaculation this cell is not mature, so it can not fertilize the oocyte. To have the ability to fertilize the female gamete, this cell suffers capacitation and acrosome reaction in female reproductive tract. The signaling pathways best described for spermatozoon involve these processes. The cAMP/PKA signaling pathway leads to sperm cells capacitation; however, adenylyl cyclase in sperm cells is different from the somatic cells. Adenylyl cyclase in spermatozoon does not recognize G proteins, so it is stimulated by bicarbonate and Ca ions. Then, it converts adenosine triphosphate into cyclic AMP, which activates Protein kinase A. PKA leads to protein tyrosine phosphorylation.\nPhospholipase C (PLC) is involved in acrosome reaction. ZP3 is a glycoprotein present in zona pelucida and it interacts with receptors in spermatozoon. So, ZP3 can activate G protein coupled receptors and tyrosine kinase receptors, that leads to production of PLC. PLC cleaves the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacyl glycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. IP3 is released as a soluble structure into the cytosol and DAG remains bound to the membrane. IP3 binds to IP3 receptors, present in acrosome membrane. In addition, calcium and DAG together work to activate protein kinase C, which goes on to phosphorylate other molecules, leading to altered cellular activity. These actions cause an increase in cytosolic concentration of Ca that leads to dispersion of actin and consequently promotes plasmatic membrane and outer acrosome membrane fusion.\nProgesterone is a steroid hormone produced in cumulus oophorus. In somatic cells it binds to receptors in nucleus; however, in spermatozoon its receptors are present in plasmatic membrane. This hormone activates AKT that leads to activation of other protein kinases, involved in capacitation and acrosome reaction.\nWhen ROS (reactive oxygen species) are present in high concentration, they can affect the physiology of cells, but when they are present in moderated concentration they are important for acrosome reaction and capacitation. ROS can interact with cAMP/PKA and progesterone pathway, stimulating them. ROS also interacts with ERK pathway that leads to activation of Ras, MEK and MEK-like proteins. These proteins activate protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) that phosphorylates various proteins important for capacitation and acrosome reaction.\n\nVarious signalling pathways, as FGF, WNT and TGF-β pathways, regulate the processes involved in embryogenesis.\n\nFGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor) ligands bind to receptors tyrosine kinase, FGFR (Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors), and form a stable complex with co-receptors HSPG (Heparan Sulphate Proteoglycans) that will promote autophosphorylation of the intracellular domain of FGFR and consequent activation of four main pathways: MAPK/ERK, PI3K, PLCγ and JAK/STAT.\nThe WNT pathway allows β-catenin function in gene transcription, once the interaction between WNT ligand and G protein-coupled receptor Frizzled inhibits GSK-3 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3) and thus formation of β-catenin destruction complex. Although there is some controversy about the effects of this pathway in embryogenesis, it is thought that WNT signalling induces primitive streak, mesoderm and endoderm formation.\nIn TGF-β (Transforming Growth Factor β) pathway, BMP (Bone Morphogenic Protein), Activin and Nodal ligands bind to their receptors and activate Smads that bind to DNA and promote gene transcription. Activin is necessary for mesoderm and specially endoderm differentiation, and Nodal and BMP are involved in embryo patterning. BMP is also responsible for formation of extra-embryonic tissues before and during gastrulation, and for early mesoderm differentiation, when Activin and FGF pathways are activated.\n\nPathway building has been performed by individual groups studying a network of interest (e.g., immune signaling pathway) as well as by large bioinformatics consortia (e.g., the Reactome Project) and commercial entities (e.g., Ingenuity Systems). Pathway building is the process of identifying and integrating the entities, interactions, and associated annotations, and populating the knowledge base. Pathway construction can have either a data-driven objective (DDO) or a knowledge-driven objective (KDO). Data-driven pathway construction is used to generate relationship information of genes or proteins identified in a specific experiment such as a microarray study. Knowledge-driven pathway construction entails development of a detailed pathway knowledge　base for particular domains of interest, such as a cell type, disease, or system. The curation process of a biological pathway entails identifying and structuring content, mining information manually and/or computationally, and assembling a knowledgebase using appropriate software tools. A schematic illustrating the major steps involved in the data-driven and knowledge-driven construction processes.\n\nFor either DDO or KDO pathway construction, the first step is to mine pertinent information from relevant information sources about the entities and interactions. The information retrieved is assembled using appropriate formats, information standards, and pathway building tools to obtain a pathway prototype. The pathway is further refined to include context-specific annotations such as species, cell/tissue type, or disease type. The pathway can then be verified by the domain experts and updated by the curators based on appropriate feedback. Recent attempts to improve knowledge integration have led to refined classifications of cellular entities, such as GO, and to the assembly of structured knowledge repositories. Data repositories, which contain information regarding sequence data, metabolism, signaling, reactions, and interactions are a major source of information for pathway building. A few useful databases are described in the following table.\nLegend: Y – Yes, N – No; BIND – Biomolecular Interaction Network Database, DIP – Database of Interacting Proteins, GNPV – Genome Network Platform Viewer, HPRD = Human Protein Reference Database, MINT – Molecular Interaction database, MIPS – Munich Information center for Protein Sequences, UNIHI – Unified Human Interactome, OPHID – Online Predicted Human Interaction Database, EcoCyc – Encyclopaedia of E. Coli Genes and Metabolism, MetaCyc – aMetabolic Pathway database, KEGG – Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, PANTHER – Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationship database, STKE – Signal Transduction Knowledge Environment, PID – The Pathway Interaction Database, BioPP – Biological Pathway Publisher. A comprehensive list of resources can be found at http://www.pathguide.org.\n\nThe increasing amount of genomic and molecular information is the basis for understanding higher-order biological systems, such as the cell and the organism, and their interactions with the environment, as well as for medical, industrial and other practical applications. The KEGG resource provides a reference knowledge base for linking genomes to biological systems, categorized as building blocks in the genomic space (KEGG GENES), the chemical space (KEGG LIGAND), wiring diagrams of interaction networks and reaction networks (KEGG PATHWAY), and ontologies for pathway reconstruction (BRITE database).\nThe KEGG PATHWAY database is a collection of manually drawn pathway maps for metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing such as signal transduction, ligand–receptor interaction and cell communication, various other cellular processes and human diseases, all based on extensive survey of published literature.\n\nGene Map Annotator and Pathway Profiler (GenMAPP) a free, open-source, stand-alone computer program is designed for organizing, analyzing, and sharing genome scale data in the context of biological pathways. GenMAPP database support multiple gene annotations and species as well as custom species database creation for a potentially unlimited number of species. Pathway resources are expanded by utilizing homology information to translate pathway content between species and extending existing pathways with data derived from conserved protein interactions and coexpression. A new mode of data visualization including time-course, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and splicing, has been implemented with GenMAPP database to support analysis of complex data. GenMAPP also offers innovative ways to display and share data by incorporating HTML export of analyses for entire sets of pathways as organized web pages. In short, GenMAPP provides a means to rapidly interrogate complex experimental data for pathway-level changes in a diverse range of organisms.\n\nGiven the genetic makeup of an organism, the complete set of possible reactions constitutes its reactome. Reactome, located at http://www.reactome.org is a curated, peer-reviewed resource of human biological processes/pathway data. The basic unit of the Reactome database is a reaction; reactions are then grouped into causal chains to form pathways The Reactome data model allows us to represent many diverse processes in the human system, including the pathways of intermediary metabolism, regulatory pathways, and signal transduction, and high-level processes, such as the cell cycle. Reactome provides a qualitative framework, on which quantitative data can be superimposed. Tools have been developed to facilitate custom data entry and annotation by expert biologists, and to allow visualization and exploration of the finished dataset as an interactive process map. Although the primary curational domain is pathways from Homo sapiens, electronic projections of human pathways onto other organisms are regularly created via putative orthologs, thus making Reactome relevant to model organism research communities. The database is publicly available under open source terms, which allows both its content and its software infrastructure to be freely used and redistributed. Studying whole transcriptional profiles and cataloging protein–protein interactions has yielded much valuable biological information, from the genome or proteome to the physiology of an organism, an organ, a tissue or even a single cell. The Reactome database containing a framework of possible reactions which, when combined with expression and enzyme kinetic data, provides the infrastructure for quantitative models, therefore, an integrated view of biological processes, which links such gene products and can be systematically mined by using bioinformatics applications. Reactome data available in a variety of standard formats, including BioPAX, SBML and PSI-MI, and also enable data exchange with other pathway databases, such as the Cycs, KEGG and amaze, and molecular interaction databases, such as BIND and HPRD. The next data release will cover apoptosis, including the death receptor signaling pathways, and the Bcl2 pathways, as well as pathways involved in hemostasis. Other topics currently under development include several signaling pathways, mitosis, visual phototransduction and hematopoeisis. In summary, Reactome provides high-quality curated summaries of fundamental biological processes in humans in a form of biologist-friendly visualization of pathways data, and is an open-source project.\n\nIn the post-genomic age, high-throughput sequencing and gene/protein profiling techniques have transformed biological research by enabling comprehensive monitoring of a biological system, yielding a list of differentially expressed genes or proteins, which is useful in identifying genes that may have roles in a given phenomenon or phenotype. With DNA microarrays and genome-wide gene engineering, it is possible to screen global gene expression profiles to contribute a wealth of genomic data to the public domain. With RNA interference, it is possible to distill the inferences contained in the experimental literature and primary databases into knowledge bases that consist of annotated representations of biological pathways. In this case, individual genes and proteins are known to be involved in biological processes, components, or structures, as well as how and where gene products interact with each other. Pathway-oriented approaches for analyzing microarray data, by grouping long lists of individual genes, proteins, and/or other biological molecules according to the pathways they are involved in into smaller sets of related genes or proteins, which reduces the complexity, have proven useful for connecting genomic data to specific biological processes and systems. Identifying active pathways that differ between two conditions can have more explanatory power than a simple list of different genes or proteins. In addition, a large number of pathway analytic methods exploit pathway knowledge in public repositories such as Gene Ontology (GO) or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), rather than inferring pathways from molecular measurements. Furthermore, different research focuses have given the word \"pathway\" different meanings. For example, 'pathway' can denote a metabolic pathway involving a sequence of enzyme-catalyzed reactions of small molecules, or a signaling pathway involving a set of protein phosphorylation reactions and gene regulation events. Therefore, the term \"pathway analysis\" has a very broad application. For instance, it can refer to the analysis physical interaction networks (e.g., protein–protein interactions), kinetic simulation of pathways, and steady-state pathway analysis (e.g., flux-balance analysis), as well as its usage in the inference of pathways from expression and sequence data. Several functional enrichment analysis tools and algorithms have been developed to enhance data interpretation. The existing knowledge base–driven pathway analysis methods in each generation have been summarized in recent literature.\n\nA program package MatchMiner was used to scan HUGO names for cloned genes of interest are scanned, then are input into GoMiner, which leveraged the GO to identify the biological processes, functions and components represented in the gene profile. Also, Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) and KEGG database can be used for the analysis of microarray expression data and the analysis of each GO biological process (P), cellular component (C), and molecular function (F) ontology. In addition, DAVID tools can be used to analyze the roles of genes in metabolic pathways and show the biological relationships between genes or gene-products and may represent metabolic pathways. These two databases also provide bioinformatics tools online to combine specific biochemical information on a certain organism and facilitate the interpretation of biological meanings for experimental data. By using a combined approach of Microarray-Bioinformatic technologies, a potential metabolic mechanism contributing to colorectal cancer (CRC) has been demonstrated Several environmental factors may be involved in a series of points along the genetic pathway to CRC. These include genes associated with bile acid metabolism, glycolysis metabolism and fatty acid metabolism pathways, supporting a hypothesis that some metabolic alternations observed in colon carcinoma may occur in the development of CRC.\n\nCellular models are instrumental in dissecting a complex pathological process into simpler molecular events. Parkinson's disease (PD) is multifactorial and clinically heterogeneous; the aetiology of the sporadic (and most common) form is still unclear and only a few molecular mechanisms have been clarified so far in the neurodegenerative cascade. In such a multifaceted picture, it is particularly important to identify experimental models that simplify the study of the different networks of proteins and genes involved. Cellular models that reproduce some of the features of the neurons that degenerate in PD have contributed to many advances in our comprehension of the pathogenic flow of the disease. In particular, the pivotal biochemical pathways (i.e. apoptosis and oxidative stress, mitochondrial impairment and dysfunctional mitophagy, unfolded protein stress and improper removal of misfolded proteins) have been widely explored in cell lines, challenged with toxic insults or genetically modified. The central role of a-synuclein has generated many models aiming to elucidate its contribution to the dysregulation of various cellular processes. Classical cellular models appear to be the correct choice for preliminary studies on the molecular action of new drugs or potential toxins and for understanding the role of single genetic factors. Moreover, the availability of novel cellular systems, such as cybrids or induced pluripotent stem cells, offers the chance to exploit the advantages of an in vitro investigation, although mirroring more closely the cell population being affected.\n\nSynaptic degeneration and death of nerve cells are defining features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent age-related neurodegenerative disorders. In AD, neurons in the hippocampus and basal forebrain (brain regions that subserve learning and memory functions) are selectively vulnerable. Studies of postmortem brain tissue from AD people have provided evidence for increased levels of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired glucose uptake in vulnerable neuronal populations. Studies of animal and cell culture models of AD suggest that increased levels of oxidative stress (membrane lipid peroxidation, in particular) may disrupt neuronal energy metabolism and ion homeostasis, by impairing the function of membrane ion-motive ATPases, glucose and glutamate transporters. Such oxidative and metabolic compromise may thereby render neurons vulnerable to excitotoxicity and apoptosis. Recent studies suggest that AD can manifest systemic alterations in energy metabolism (e.g., increased insulin resistance and dysregulation of glucose metabolism). Emerging evidence that dietary restriction can forestall the development of AD is consistent with a major \"metabolic\" component to these disorders, and provides optimism that these devastating brain disorders of aging may be largely preventable.\n\n"}

The duchy lay left of the Rhine river between the Electorate of Cologne in the east and the Duchy of Limburg in the west. It had territories on both sides of the river Rur, around its capital Jülich – the former Roman \"Iuliacum\" – in the lower Rhineland. The duchy amalgamated with the County of Berg beyond the Rhine in 1423, and from then on also became known as \"Jülich-Berg\".\n\nIts territory lies in present-day Germany (part of North Rhine-Westphalia) and in the present-day Netherlands (part of the Limburg province), its population sharing the same Limburgish dialect.\n\nThe first count in the gau of Jülich in Lower Lorraine, Gerhard I, was mentioned in 1003; his grandson Gerhard III began to call himself Count of Jülich in 1081. William IV, who became count in 1219, significantly enlarged the territory and in 1234 granted Jülich town privileges, provoking the Cologne Archbishop Konrad von Hochstaden, whose troops devastated the city five years later. William IV's son Walram (Count from 1278 to 1297) remained a fierce opponent of the Bishopric, supporting Duke John I of Brabant at the 1288 Battle of Worringen against Archbishop Siegfried II of Westerburg. Though Walram's younger brother Count Gerhard V had sided with German king Adolf of Nassau against his rival Albert I of Habsburg, he managed to retain his territories after Adolf of Nassau lost the Battle of Göllheim in 1298, and in 1314 supported the coronation of Louis IV of Wittelsbach at the nearby City of Aachen, once more against the will of the Cologne bishop.\nThe long-time conflict came to an end when Gerhard's younger son Walram became Archbishop of Cologne in 1332. His elder brother Count William V in 1336 received the title of a margrave from Emperor Louis IV, and in 1356 Emperor Charles IV of Luxembourg raised William V to the rank of duke. His son Duke William II, however, became entangled in a fierce feud with the Emperor's half-brother Wenceslaus of Luxembourg, Duke of Brabant, whom he defeated at the Battle of Baesweiler in 1371.\n\nThereafter Jülich's history became closely intertwined with that of its neighbours: the Duchies of Cleves and Berg as well as Guelders and the County of Mark: Duke William II had married Mary, the daughter of Duke Reginald II of Guelders, and duchess herself after the death of her half-brother Reginald III of Guelders in 1371. William II settled the conflict with the Imperial House of Luxembourg and his son William III inherited both duchies. When in 1423 however his younger brother Rainald died without heirs, the Gelderland estates chose Arnold of Egmond as duke, while Jülich amalgamated with Berg.\n\nIn 1511 Duke John III of Cleves inherited Jülich and Berg through marriage with Maria of Jülich-Berg, the daughter of the last Duke, William IV. She inherited her father's estates: Jülich and Berg with the County of Ravensberg. From 1521 Jülich-Berg and Cleves formed the United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg in a personal union under Duke John III.\n\nWhen the last duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg died without direct heirs in 1609, the War of the Jülich succession broke out. It ended with the 1614 Treaty of Xanten, which divided the separate duchies between Palatinate-Neuburg and the Margraviate of Brandenburg. Jülich and Berg fell to Count Palatine Wolfgang William of Neuburg and after the last duke of Palatinate-Neuburg (also Elector of the Palatinate from 1685) Charles III Philip had died without issue in 1742, Count Charles Theodore of Palatinate-Sulzbach (after 1777 also Duke of Bavaria) inherited Jülich and Berg.\n\nIn 1794 Revolutionary France occupied the Duchy of Jülich (Duché de Juliers), which became part of the French département of the Roer. The Treaty of Lunéville in 1801 officially acknowledged the cession of Jülich to France. In 1815, following the defeat of Napoleon, the duchy became part of the Prussian Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg (after 1822 part of the Prussian Rhine Province), except for the cities Sittard and Tegelen, which became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.\n\n\n– \"1393-1423 in Union with Guelders, from 1423 with Berg, from 1437 with Ravensberg\" –\n\n\n– \"from 1521 a part of the United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg\" –\n\n– \"in union with Berg and Palatinate-Neuburg, after 1690 also with the Electorate of the Palatinate, from 1777 also with Bavaria–\n\nSeveral cities and municipalities belonged to the Duchy of Jülich: -\nJülichDürenMünstereifelEuskirchenNideggenBergheimKasterGrevenbroichMönchengladbachDahlenDülkenLinnichRanderathBrüggenSüchtelnAldenhovenHeimbachMonschau WassenbergHeinsbergGangeltGeilenkirchenWaldfeuchtSittardSusterenSinzigTegelenRemagen.\n\n\n<BR>\n"}

A member of the Conservative Party, she has served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Mid Bedfordshire since 2005. She is considered to be on the political right of the Conservative Party.\n\nBorn in Liverpool to a working class family, Dorries began work as a trainee nurse and subsequently became a medical representative. During her early career, she spent a year in Zambia as the head of a community school. After returning to the UK, she founded Company Kids Ltd; which provided child day-care services for working parents. She sold the company in 1998.\n\nDorries was elected to Parliament at the 2005 general election for the Conservative safe seat of Mid Bedfordshire, with a majority of 11,355 votes. As a backbencher, she introduced several unsuccessful Private Member's Bills, including attempts to reduce the time limit for abortions in the UK and changes to the rules regarding counselling for the women involved, and the advocacy of sexual abstinence for girls in sex education. An opponent of John Bercow, she attempted to have him removed as Speaker of the House of Commons. She also clashed with David Cameron and George Osborne, describing them as \"two arrogant posh boys\". In November 2012, she was suspended from the Conservative whip owing to her taking part in reality TV programme \"I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!\" without informing the Chief Whip. The whip was returned to Dorries in May 2013 and she was re-admitted to the parliamentary party.\n\nIn July 2019, Boris Johnson made Dorries Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Health and Social Care with responsibility for mental health, suicide prevention and patient safety. In February 2020, she was the first MP to be diagnosed with COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic. In May of that year, she was promoted to the rank of Minister of State.\n\nBorn Nadine Vanessa Bargery in Liverpool, her father was a bus driver who became a lift operator having suffered from Raynaud's disease. Her father was a Roman Catholic of Irish descent, while her mother was an English Protestant. She was raised as a Protestant. She was raised in Anfield, Liverpool, and educated at Rose Heath Primary School and Halewood Grange Comprehensive School, before her family moved to Runcorn. She grew up on a council estate. She entered nursing in 1975 as a trainee at Warrington General Hospital.\n\nAccording to an interview with \"The Times\" in 2014, Dorries' parents divorced during her adolescence. While training to be a nurse at 21, she shared a flat with her father. He died at the age of 42. From 1978 to 1981, she was a nurse in Warrington and Liverpool according to a 2009 report. Her CV when she was a parliamentary candidate in 2001 stated Liverpool and London as places where she worked as a nurse. She left the Merseyside area after she married Paul Dorries, a mining engineer.\n\nIn 1982, Dorries became a medical representative to Ethicla Ltd for a year, before spending a year in Zambia (1983–84) as the head of a community school, where her husband ran a copper mine. She founded Company Kids Ltd in 1987 which provided child day-care services for working parents. The company was sold in 1998 to BUPA; Dorries was subsequently a director of the health provider during the following year.\n\nAs Nadine Bargery, she was selected as the prospective parliamentary candidate (PPC) for Hazel Grove in Spring 2000. Her candidacy split the constituency party, and she was briefly deselected in August before being centrally imposed. Standing for the seat at the 2001 general election, she was unsuccessful in her attempt to succeed the Liberal Democrat candidate Andrew Stunell, who retained the seat with a majority of 8,435 votes. Dorries worked for three years as a special adviser to Oliver Letwin, then Shadow Chancellor, including managing his relations with the media.\n\nIn 2009, she gave this account of her 2005 selection:\nThree weeks before the 2005 general election I, a council estate Scouser, was selected as the Conservative candidate to represent a southern rural constituency. Because the vacancy occurred so quickly and so close to D-day, the party provided my association with a shortlist of seventeen candidates, of which about five were women. Following a long day of interviews in hot sunny rooms, the list was whittled down to a shortlist of three ... I was informed that I had been selected outright on the first ballot ... That pride, that sense of achievement, the knowledge that I was selected on the basis of my performance and merit above all other candidates on that day is what enables me to hold my head up high in this place.\n\nDorries' account of her own selection appears to contradict a news report which \"The Times\" ran at the time, reporting that Conservative Campaign Headquarters placed a majority of women on the shortlist and pressed for the selection of a female candidate:\nMrs Dorries, who has three teenage children, easily beat her 11 rivals and won the plum safe seat on the first ballot at the selection this weekend. Party officials were thrilled that the seat has gone to a woman. Previously, only two women had been selected in the 17 safe seats where sitting MPs have retired. Senior party figures had made clear to local dignitaries that they would like the seat to go to a woman and presented the constituency with a shortlist of seven women and five men to underline the point.\n\nIn a debate on \"Woman's Hour\", broadcast on 22 August 2001, Dorries (as Nadine Bargery) had advocated all-women shortlists if the behaviour of Conservative selection committees did not change. In 2009 though, Dorries was highly critical of David Cameron's proposal to consider using all-women shortlists, arguing against a move which would create \"two classes of MPs\". She wrote that \"Sometimes I feel sorry for some of the Labour women who were selected via all-women shortlists. Everyone knows who they are. They are constantly derided.\"\n\nDorries was elected to the House of Commons at the 2005 general election for the safe seat of Mid Bedfordshire on the retirement through ill health after a series of scandals of Jonathan Sayeed, with a majority of 11,355, and made her maiden speech on 25 May 2005. She was re-elected in 2010, with an increased majority and a swing of 2.3% from the Lib Dems.\n\nDorries, described as \"a right-wing, working-class Conservative\", is a member of the socially conservative Cornerstone Group. A Christian, she has said in an interview for a Salvation Army newspaper: \"I am not an MP for any reason other than because God wants me to be. There is nothing I did that got me here; it is what God did. There is nothing amazing or special about me, I am just a conduit for God to use.\" In 2008, she won \"The Spectator\" magazine's Readers' Representative Award.\n\nDorries initially supported the attempt of David Davis to become Conservative leader in 2005 but later withdrew her endorsement. David Cameron, the successful candidate, though \"represent[s] everything that through my life . . . [I have] been suspicious of.\" In May 2007, she criticised Cameron for ignoring the recommendations of the Conservative public policy working group in favour of grammar schools. However, she did defend the selection of Elizabeth Truss in 2009, whose Conservative candidature was called into question after an extra-marital affair was revealed.\n\nDorries served as a member of the Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills Committee. In the year to November 2008, she attended only 2% of sessions. The committee then reformed as the Science and Technology Select Committee; she did not attend a single session. In 2010, she was elected to the Health Select Committee.\n\nDorries has said she witnessed \"botched\" abortions on two occasions, an experience that influenced her campaign to lower the point during a pregnancy at which an abortion can be performed.\n\nOn 31 October 2006, Dorries introduced a Private Member's Bill in the House of Commons, which would have reduced the time limit for abortion in Great Britain from 24 to 21 weeks; introduced a ten-day 'cooling-off' period for women wishing to have an abortion, during which time the woman would be required to undergo counselling; and accelerate access to abortion at the end of the cooling-off period. Dorries alleged she had received death threats from pro-choice activists and was given police protection. Parliament voted by 187 to 108 to reject the bill.\n\nIn May 2008, Dorries tabled an amendment to the proposed Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill seeking to reduce the upper limit for abortions to 20 weeks from the current 24 weeks of pregnancy. Reportedly written by Andrea Williams then of The Lawyers' Christian Fellowship, Dorries has denied that her campaigning on the abortion issue receives funding from Christian fundamentalist groups, although Dorries website for the \"20 Reasons for 20 Weeks\" campaign in 2008 was registered by Christian Concern For Our Nation (CCFON), another organisation with which Williams is involved; one of the pressure group's interns set up the website without charge to Dorries. According to \"Guardian\" journalist Kira Cochrane it was the greatest challenge to women's abortion rights in nearly 20 years.\n\nDorries' amendment was defeated by 332 votes to 190, with a separate 22-week limit opposed by 304 votes to 233. A majority of MPs continued to support the 24-week limit. She said of her tactics on this issue in 2007: \"If I were to argue that all abortions should be banned, the ethical discussions would go round in circles ... My view is that the only way\nforward is to argue for a reduction in the time limit ... it’s every baby’s right to have a life.\"\n\nIn May 2008, Dorries featured in the Channel 4 \"Dispatches\" documentary \"In God's Name\". The programme examined the growing influence of Christian evangelical movements in the UK and highlighted the Lawyers' Christian Fellowship's involvement in lobbying the British Government on issues such as abortion, gay rights and the enforcing of laws relating to blasphemy. The programme included footage of a LCF representative meeting with Dorries to influence policy on matters where they had a common agenda.\n\nIn April 2009, Dorries stated that she had commenced legal action following the leaked publication of emails sent by Damian McBride, Prime Minister Gordon Brown's head of strategy and planning, which suggested spreading a rumour that Dorries had a one-night stand with a fellow MP, in an email to Derek Draper, a Labour-supporting blogger. McBride resigned and Dorries denounced the accusation as libellous: \"[t]he allegations regarding myself are 100 per cent untrue\", and demanded an apology intent on exposing the Number 10 \"cesspit\".\n\nBrown subsequently said he was \"sorry\" and that he took \"full responsibility for what happened\". Dorries threatened libel proceedings against McBride, Draper and Downing Street but did not carry out that threat. McBride paid Dorries an undisclosed sum, estimated at £1,000 plus £2,500 towards her costs.\n\nIn May 2009, \"The Daily Telegraph\", as part of its exposure of MPs' expenses claims, questioned whether the property in Dorries' constituency, on which she claimed £24,222 Additional Costs Allowance (for \"secondary\" housing costs), had been in fact her main or only home from 2007 onwards. The newspaper also queried hotel bills including one for 'Mr N Dorries': these had been disallowed by the Fees Office and Dorries said they were submitted by mistake. On 22 May 2009, she spoke on BBC Radio 4 and drew parallels between the McCarthy 'Witch-Hunts' and the press's 'drip-drip' revelation of MP's expenses, eliciting David Cameron's public criticism. She said everyone was fearing a 'suicide', and colleagues were constantly checking up on each other. Later in the day her blog was taken down. It transpired that Withers, lawyers acting for the Barclay Brothers, the owners of the \"Daily Telegraph\", had required the removal of the blog, on threat of libel action against the service provider.\n\nIn January 2010, it was reported that Dorries was being investigated by John Lyon, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, regarding her claim for second home expenses There was some debate as to the location of her main home. It was also reported that Dorries had claimed £20,000 in office expenses for work undertaken by a media relations and public affairs company.\n\nIn late 2009, Dorries campaigned against what she called \"a proposal to ban the wearing of high heels in the office\" which was to be debated at the 2009 Trades Union Congress (TUC). The motion, submitted to the TUC by the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists, pointed out that \"around two million days a year are lost through sickness as a result of lower limb disorders\" and that \"many employers in the retail sector force women workers to wear high heels as part of their dress code\". It did not call for a ban on high heels at work, but rather called on employers to consider the health impact of their dress codes and encourage the wearing of healthy, comfortable shoes.\n\nPrior to John Bercow's election as Speaker of the House of Commons in June 2009, Dorries accused him of opportunism and disloyalty to the Conservative Party and questioned his mental stability. She described his election as \"a two-fingered salute to the British people from Labour MPs, and to the Conservative Party\". After Bercow's wife, Sally, was approved as a Labour parliamentary candidate and gave an interview about her personal life, Dorries argued that the Bercows were damaging the historic respect accorded to the office of Speaker.\n\nIn February 2010 Dorries took part in the Channel 4 documentary series \"Tower Block of Commons\", in which MPs stay with welfare claimants.\n\nIn October 2010, Dorries suggested that benefit claimants who made more than 35,000 postings on Twitter should be reported to the Department for Work and Pensions. On being told by the \"Bedfordshire on Sunday\" newspaper that one of her constituents was out of work because of ill health and had posted more than 37,000 tweets, Dorries told the newspaper that her constituent's tweeting gave housebound disabled people a bad name.\n\nThe Conservative Party returned to power in coalition with the Liberal Democrats following the 2010 general election. In 2012, she was voted best MP on Twitter by the \"politics.co.uk\" website.\n\nShe was reportedly part of a plot to oust John Bercow from the Speaker's chair in the run up to the 2010 general election, and, after the election, sent an email to all new MPs advocating his removal.\n\nOn 9 May 2010, two days after retaining the Mid Bedfordshire seat at the general election, \"The Sunday Times\" reported that Dorries was facing the first complaint about an MP's expenses claim of the new parliament. The newspaper reported that she had claimed around £10,000 for an annual report in 2007 on her performance as an MP, but that her former Commons researcher had never seen the report or worked on it. Dorries insisted that she had indeed published the report, placing a photograph of it on her blog. She subsequently told the \"Biggleswade Advertiser\" that the report was never printed and a credit note issued with refund on 13 September 2008.\n\nOn 13 January 2011, it was reported by the \"Daily Mirror\" that police were investigating Dorries concerning her expenses. Three days later, \"The Sunday Times\" reported that police had since handed a file to the Crown Prosecution Service for consideration. In February 2013, it was reported that Dorries was being investigated by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority over her expenses, although no specific details were given at this time.\n\nOn 27 June 2013, Dorries announced she would no longer claim her personal expenses as an MP, but would draw on her salary for such costs. She argued that she would be in a better position to campaign for the abolition of the present expenses arrangements by doing so. Dorries herself stood for election as a deputy speaker after one of the three posts became vacant. In the Commons vote during October 2013, she gained the support of 13 MPs, and was the first of the six candidates to be eliminated in the voting process.\n\nA complaint from the Liberal Conspiracy website, regarding Dorries' use of the House of Commons' Portcullis emblem on her blog, had been upheld in March 2008, on the basis that Dorries \"gave the impression it had some kind of parliamentary endorsement or authority.\"\n\nOn 21 October 2010, the MP's standards watchdog criticised Dorries for maintaining a blog which would \"mislead constituents\" as to how much actual time she was spending in her constituency. Dorries said: \"My blog is 70% fiction and 30% fact. It is written as a tool to enable my constituents to know me better and to reassure them of my commitment to Mid Bedfordshire. I rely heavily on poetic licence and frequently replace one place name/event/fact with another.\" Referring to her main home being in Gloucestershire she said \"I have always been aware that should my personal domestic arrangements become the knowledge of my political opponents, they would be able to exaggerate that to good effect.\"\n\nShe gave an explanation of the statement to her local newspaper, in which she said that her whereabouts on her blog had been disguised, on police advice, because of unwanted attention. She also said that she made the statement in order to protect her staff and family.\n\nOn 27 October 2010, Dorries partially retracted her 70% fiction claim, posting a blog entry which stated that \"It also only takes any individual with a smattering of intelligence to see that everything on the blog is accurate, because it is largely a record of real time events. It was only ever the perception of where I was on any particular day which was disguised.\"\n\nThe conservative journalist Peter Oborne suggested, in his \"Telegraph\" blog a fortnight later, that Cameron should have \"ordered Miss Dorries to apologise personally to her constituents, and stripped her of the party whip there and then.\"\n\nOn 4 May 2011, Dorries proposed a bill to require that sex education in schools should include content promoting abstinence to girls aged 13–16 which was presented as teaching them \"how to say no.\" While sex education already mentions the option of abstinence, the bill would have required active promotion of abstinence to girls, with no such requirement in the education provided to boys. Owing to Dorries' claims about practices used in teaching about sex, Sarah Ditum in \"The Guardian\" accused Dorries of making Sex and Relationship Education (SRE) \"sound like a terrifying exercise in depravity.\"\n\nThe bill drew criticism from healthcare and sex education professionals, questioning claims made during the bill's reading. Labour MP Chris Bryant described the bill as being \"the daftest piece of legislation I have seen\". Dorries accused her opponents of behaving as though she were advocating \"the compulsory wearing of chastity belts for all teenage girls.\"\n\nThe sexual abstinence bill was set for second reading on 20 January 2012 (Bill 185), after she was granted leave to introduce the Bill on a vote of 67 to 61 on 4 May 2011. The Bill, placed eighth on the order paper, was withdrawn shortly before its second reading.\n\nDorries proposed amendments to the Health and Social Care Bill 2011 which would have blocked abortion services such as BPAS and Marie Stopes International from providing counselling services. She argued that these organisations had a vested financial interest in encouraging abortions, but according to Zoe Williams \"independent\" counselling services could be \"faith-based groups\" intent on discouraging women from having an abortion. David Cameron's government at first supported the proposal, but later changed its mind, reportedly because then-Liberal Democrat leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was opposed to the change.\n\nDorries' criticism of Cameron's policy shift was supported by some commentators such as Cristina Odone who shares Dorries concerns. Clegg's apparent opposition was for Dorries a means of \"blackmailing our Prime Minister\", and a question regarding Lib Dems influence was the source of Cameron's description of Dorries as \"extremely frustrated\" at Prime minister's questions on 7 September. Cameron was criticised by feminists among others for the comment, and subsequently apologised.\n\nThe issue of abortion counselling was debated in the Commons immediately following this incident. The motion was originally seconded by Labour MP Frank Field, but he withdrew his support after health minister Anne Milton intervened to suggest the government would support the spirit of Dorries' amendment. The amendment was lost by 368 votes to 118, a majority of 250. Despite this, Dorries claimed a victory because of Milton's comments.\n\nIn August 2011, Dorries led the first delegation of Members of Parliament to Equatorial Guinea. Equatorial Guinea is a small African country, but the third-biggest oil producer on the continent, ruled since 1979 by President Teodoro Obiang Nguema. It has one of the worst human rights records on the continent. She met the Prime Minister of Equatorial Guinea, Ignacio Milam Tang. She has been quoted as saying to him: \"We are here to dispel some of the myths about Equatorial Guinea and also with humility to offer you help to avoid the mistakes we have made.\" According to the official website of Equatorial Guinea, Dorries was one of nine MPs on the trip.\n\nOn 6 March 2012, Dorries criticised David Cameron and Nick Clegg of the coalition government over their taxation policies. Referring to the proposed cuts in child benefit, she told the \"Financial Times\" \"The problem is that policy is being run by two public schoolboys who don't know what it's like to go to the supermarket and have to put things back on the shelves because they can't afford it for their children's lunchboxes. What's worse, they don't care, either\". She again criticised Cameron, and also George Osborne, in similar terms on 23 April, calling them \"two arrogant posh boys who don't know the price of milk – who show no remorse, no contrition and no passion to want to understand the lives of others\".\n\nFollowing Dorries' claim, in a \"Mail on Sunday\" article, that Cameron could be replaced within a year, George Osborne said on \"The Andrew Marr Show\" on 6 May 2012: \"Nadine Dorries, for the last seven years, I don't think has agreed with anything either myself, David Cameron, or indeed most Conservatives in the leadership of the party have done\". In the summer of 2012, Dorries criticised Osborne again for sending a badly briefed junior Treasury Minister, Chloe Smith, to deputise for him on \"Newsnight\" in order to defend a government u-turn on fuel duty.\n\nDorries opposed the government's ultimately successful legislation to introduce same-sex marriage. In May 2012, on the Conservative Home website she wrote: \"Gay marriage is a policy which has been pursued by the metro elite gay activists and needs to be put into the same bin [as reform of the House of Lords]\". In an interview with Mehdi Hasan in October 2012, Dorries said she favoured gay marriage, but only after Britain has left the European Convention on Human Rights. In an exchange with Iain Dale around the same time, she speculated that issue could cost her (then) party four million votes at the next general election.\n\nIn February 2013, at the time of the Bill's second reading in the House of Commons, she argued that the bill avoided the issue of consummation and thus contradicted the Marriages Act 1973, and therefore did not make gay marriage equal to heterosexual marriage. She also argued that there was no provision for adultery, or faithlessness, as it might apply to gay couples because the term applies to heterosexual couples only.\n\nEarly in November 2012, it was announced that Dorries had agreed to appear in \"I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here\". Other Conservatives objected to her decision and her constituents were \"overwhelmingly negative\" on local radio. Neither the Conservative Chief Whip, Sir George Young, or the Chairman of the Mid Bedfordshire Conservative Association were informed of her absence from Parliament. The Conservative Party suspended Dorries from the party whip on 6 November, after her confirmation that she was planning to be absent from Parliament. John Lyon, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, received a complaint about her behaviour.\n\nThe series began on 11 November 2012, but on 21 November; Dorries became the first contestant to be voted off the show. Dorries met George Young on 27 November, who asked her to rebuild her relationship with the party. She then sat as an independent MP, but continued to deny the whip had been withdrawn, stating it had merely been suspended.\n\nOn 8 May 2013, Dorries regained the Conservative whip without any conditions having been applied. George Osborne reportedly objected to her regaining the parliamentary whip, while commentators speculated that, should she not be readmitted, Dorries might join UKIP, which had made gains from the Conservatives in the previous week's local elections. Peter Oborne observed at this point that Dorries had still not declared the amount she was paid for her appearance on \"I'm a Celebrity...\" in the register of members interests, last published on 22 April, despite her promise to do so.\n\nShortly after regaining the whip, Dorries floated the idea of joint Conservative-UKIP candidates at the next general election in 2015, with herself as such a candidate. \"This is not party policy and it's not going to happen\", a Conservative Party spokesman told the Press Association.\n\nFollowing the publication of a report by the Standards Committee on 11 November 2013, Dorries apologised in the House of Commons to her fellow MPs for two errors of judgement. Her confidentiality agreement with ITV over her fee for appearing on \"I'm A Celebrity...\" had led to her refusing to disclose the information to Kathryn Hudson, the parliamentary commissioner for standards. In so doing, she had broken the MP's code of conduct. The all-party standards committee said that she should never have agreed to such a clause in her contract. In addition, Dorries had falsely claimed that payment for eight pieces of work in the media did not need to be declared as they were made to Averbrook, her company, rather than to herself directly. Andy McSmith, writing in \"The Independent\" at the beginning of December 2013, said that Dorries had finally disclosed her income (amounting to £20,228 in total) from appearing on \"I'm a Celebrity...\" in the register of members' interests.\n\nDorries' daughter was among the highest-earning family members employed by MPs with a salary of £40,000–45,000 as an office manager, even though her daughter lived 96 miles away from the office. Subsequently, Dorries' sister was taken on as \"senior secretary\" with a salary of £30,000–35,000.\n\nIn October 2013, Dorries criticised a fellow Conservative MP, Kris Hopkins, as \"one of parliament's slimiest, nastiest MPs\" on her Twitter account, and criticised Prime Minister David Cameron's decision to promote Hopkins to a junior ministerial post within the Department for Communities and Local Government as \"a really awful decision\".\n\nA Conservative majority government was elected at the 2015 general election.\n\nOn 29 May 2015, the independent candidate in Mid Bedfordshire, Tim Ireland, lodged an appeal against the result accusing Dorries of breaches of section 106 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 by making false statements about his character. The development first emerged in early-June after the three-week petition for such an action had expired. The petition was rejected by the High Court of Justice because it was served at Dorries' constituency office and not her home address.\n\n\"Buzzfeed\" reported that in October 2017 Dorries had become confused about her party's position on Brexit after talking with a politics teacher about a key element of her party's position, Britain's proposed exit from the European Union Customs Union. The EU Customs Union is an agreement between EU members not to impose tariffs (i.e. import taxes) on goods passing across their mutual borders. From a semi-private discussion that \"Buzzfeed\" made public, it was suggested that Dorries believed the UK could leave the EU but stay within the customs union whilst at the same time negotiating free trade deals with other countries. Later in December 2017 she tweeted: \"If we stay in the single market and the customs union, we haven't left.\"\n\nIn August 2018, Boris Johnson was criticised for a column that he had written in the \"Daily Telegraph\". As part of an article discussing the introduction of a burka ban in Denmark, Johnson said that Muslim women who wore burkas \"look like letter boxes\" and the garment gave them the appearance of \"bank robbers\", although the point of the article was to condemn governments who tell 'a free-born adult woman what she may or may not wear, in a public place, when she is simply minding her own business'. Dorries, however, said that Johnson \"did not go far enough\", saying the burka should have no place in Britain and it was \"shameful that countries like France and Denmark are way ahead of us on this\". On 7 August 2018, Dorries tweeted \"No woman in a liberal, progressive society should be forced to cover up her beauty or her bruises.\"\n\nIn November 2018, Dorries, who was strongly in favour of Brexit, said of the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated between the UK Government and the EU27: \"This is a very sad place to be, but unfortunately, the future of the country and of our relationship with Europe is at stake. This deal gives us no voice, no votes, no MEPs, no commissioner\".\n\nWhen Boris Johnson became prime minister in July 2019, Dorries was appointed as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Mental Health, Suicide Prevention and Patient Safety. \n\nOn 10 March 2020, she was the first MP to be diagnosed with COVID-19 in the 2019–20 pandemic. As a carrier of the virus, it was revealed she could have infected the guests of an International Women's Day event that took place on 3 March at Downing Street and, on 6 March, she held surgery attended by 12 people, whose details were later passed on to the National Health Service.\n\nIn May 2020, Dorries was promoted to the ministerial rank of Minister of State.\n\nOn 14 May 2020, Dorries was criticised after she retweeted a doctored video from a far-right Twitter account which falsely claimed that Labour leader Keir Starmer obstructed the prosecution of grooming gangs while he served as Director of Public Prosecutions.\n\nIt became public knowledge in September 2013 that Dorries had signed a three-book deal for a six-figure advance. The first book was published the following April.\n\nHer first novel, \"The Four Streets\", which draws on her Liverpool Catholic background, became a No.1 best-selling e-book with 100,000 copies sold in the format by July 2014, although print sales in hardback and paperback were significantly lower with, respectively, 2,735 and 637 units sold by then. Dorries' work of fiction gained mostly negative reviews.\n\nSarah Ditum in the \"New Statesman\" complained that some of the sentences \"read like clippings from Wikipedia\" while Christopher Howse, writing for \"The Daily Telegraph\", thought \"The Four Streets\" was \"the worst novel I've read in 10 years.\" \"You should read the next one. It’s much better\", Dorries told Ann Treneman of \"The Times\".\n\nDorries was married to Paul Dorries, with whom she had three daughters. The couple separated in 2007 and subsequently divorced. She is a keen supporter of Liverpool Football Club. She has said that her great-grandfather, George Bargery, was one of the founders of Everton Football Club.\n\nAfter Dorries tested positive for COVID-19 in March 2020, close contacts who revealed symptoms of the virus were forced to self-isolate. She said the COVID-19 caused her to completely lose her sense of taste and smell.\n\n"}

After graduation he worked as a civil engineer for Morrison Construction and as a student reporter for the Gaelic section of BBC Radio Scotland. After qualifying as a teacher at Jordanhill College in 1996 , he then taught the first Gaelic Medium Class at Salen and Acharacle Primary Schools in Argyll on the Scottish mainland.\n\nUnusually, MacNeil is a Roman Catholic representing a strongly Presbyterian parliamentary constituency.\n\nAfter being defeated by the Labour Party's David Stewart in Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber at the 2001 general election, he was elected in 2005 for (the Western Isles), gaining the seat from Labour's Calum MacDonald.\n\nIn March 2006, MacNeil came to attention when he lodged a complaint with the Metropolitan Police regarding the Labour Party Cash for Peerages scandal. In April 2006, he and former \"anti-corruption\" MP Martin Bell wrote to prime minister, Tony Blair calling for all appointments to the House of Lords to be suspended in the wake of the scandal. In November 2006 he won the Best Scot at Westminster section of the Scottish Politician of the Year awards for instigating the inquiry into possible abuse of the honours system. On 17 November 2006 MacNeil had the highest bill for travel in 2006–07. This is mainly due to the distance of his constituency from London as well as the dispersed geographical nature of the constituency. He also received awards from \"The Spectator\" magazine and the Political Studies Society for setting the political agenda in Britain during 2006. He is a member of the editorial board for political monthly \"Total Politics\". MacNeil was re-elected to Parliament in 2010.\n\nHe has served on a number of parliamentary committees. In June 2015 he was appointed chair of the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee; in July 2016, chair of the International Trade Select Committee; and in October 2017, a member of the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy.\n\nOutside of Parliament, he has also served as a member of the Advisory Board at \"Polar Research and Policy Initiative\" since February 2016.\n\nIn July 2019 MacNeil criticised the then Conservative leadership candidate, Boris Johnson for stating that learning English is essential for immigrants. MacNeil called English a \"Germanic import\" in contrast to indigenous Celtic languages.\n\nIn 2007, the \"Sunday Mail\" reported MacNeil had \"kissed and fondled\" two girls aged 17 and 18 in a hotel room while his pregnant wife was in hospital, in 2005. MacNeil said he bitterly regretted the incident and said he was angry it had diverted attention from the \"substantial political issues\" he had been pursuing. In a statement, MacNeil, then 36, apologised for the \"embarrassment and hurt\" caused to his family by his actions.\nIn May 2016, MacNeil and his wife announced that they had separated; this followed reports that MacNeil had had an affair with a Westminster-based journalist, Serena Cowdy.\n\n"}

His paintings draw on pop art and the work of Alphonse Mucha, and often depict celebrities, including Madonna.\n\nPaul Harvey was born in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire. He attended Burton Grammar School (1971–1978) and North Staffordshire Polytechnic (1978–1982) for Foundation Art and BA (Hons) Design. In 1982 he moved to London and played in post-punk bands including Happy Refugees; in 1986 he moved to Newcastle to join Pauline Murray's band. During this time, he co-published-and-drew \"Mauretania Comics\" with comics artist Chris Reynolds, and also taught graffiti art.\n\nIn 2001, he became a full-time lecturer in graphic design at North Tyneside College (now Tyne Metropolitan College, within The Creative Studios department). The same year, he joined the Stuckism art group, founding a Newcastle branch. In 2002, he joined Murray's re-formed punk band Penetration; he curated the show, \"Stuck in Newcastle\", at the Newcastle Arts Centre, and was a joint winner of the Stuckists \"Real Turner Prize Show 2002\".\n\nHe showed with the group at the Wednesbury Museum in 2003. 2003–2005, he gained an MA in Fine Art Practice at the University of Northumbria. In 2004, he was the Stuckist co-curator with Hiroko Oshima of the Ryu Art Group of the show, \"Members Only: the Artist Group in Japan and Britain\", which took place at the Bailiffgate Museum, Alnwick.\n\nHe was a featured artist in \"The Stuckists Punk Victorian\" show at the Walker Art Gallery for the 2004 Liverpool Biennial. His painting of artist and model Emily Mann was used to promote the show. The painting was based on a photograph of Mann by Charles Thomson and was originally intended to promote the Stuckists \"Real Turner Prize Show 2003\": at that time the placard contained the text, \"Serota needs a good spanking\".\n\nHowever, according to Harvey, another artist Gina Bold \"got really angry and started a debate about the S&M/fetish allusion. She got really pissed off with me because I didn’t agree with her. Then it got a bit nasty—the whole thing was just daft. Then the show got cancelled—and it had all been a complete waste of my fucking time.\" He later repainted the placard with a woman's face, and it was used in this form for the Walker show.\n\nIn 2006, he was one of the ten \"leading Stuckists\" in the Go West exhibition at Spectrum London gallery. In 2007, he was in the show, \"I Won't Have Sex with You as Long as We're Married\", at the A Gallery.\n\nIn 2008, he was commissioned by Job cigarette papers to create a set of campaign posters with a stylistic reference to Alphonse Mucha, who had created earlier paintings for the firm. Harvey made works featuring famous double acts to emphasise the sales message of \"The Original Double\", a reference to the twin-size packets of papers made by Job. Harvey's enthusiasm for the project came about because \"Mucha is one of his heroes\", said Mark Ross, the director of Glorious Creative agency managing the campaign. The work created some controversy: Gilbert and George gave their endorsement to the images, but The Mighty Boosh and The White Stripes were not pleased to be featured. \"Famous Doubles\", a show of the original paintings used for the posters, was promoted at the Wanted Gallery in Notting Hill by Fraser Kee Scott, director of the A Gallery.\n\nIn 2009, his painting of Charles Saatchi was banned from the window display of the Artspace Gallery in Maddox Street, London, on the grounds that it was \"too controversial for the area\". It was the centrepiece of the show, \"Stuckist Clowns Doing Their Dirty Work\", the first exhibition of the Stuckists in Mayfair, and showed Saatchi with a sheep at his feet and a halo made from a cheese wrapper. The Saatchi Gallery said that Saatchi \"would not have any problem\" with the painting's display. The gallery announced they were shutting down the show. Harvey said:\nThe Stuckists considered legal action, and co-ordinated, on the event's Facebook page, a campaign of emails to the gallery, which agreed to exhibit the painting in the window and to continue the show.\n\nAs of 2010, Harvey is researching a PhD on Stuckism at Northumbria University.\n\nCurrently, Harvey teaches Graphic Design at Queen Alexandra Sixth Form College in North Shields.\n\nHis images are often derived from pictures of film and singing \"stars\" in magazines, and reworked into a new context. His style references pop art and Alfons Mucha. The incorporation of modern symbols poses an ambiguity as to the amount of irony present, though the artist has claimed that he does not intend this. Possibly his best-known work is a painting of the singer Madonna. The elements mentioned are clearly visible, with small dumbbells around the border, for example Madonna, contrasting with Art Nouveau curves and languidity.\nHe has described his work as strong line defining flat areas of colour, \"dealing with ideas of beauty and decoration\" and often appropriating images from art history and popular culture.\n\nHe describes his methodology: \"I use photographs but change the composition on a computer. I project onto canvas, trace the masses with a blue pencil, paint the details freehand with a sable brush, and the larger areas two to four times (for opacity) with Japanese or decorator’s brushes. I often change figures to get it right. I paint incessantly at home—paintings take up to three months.\"\n\n"}

An example of a performative contradiction is the statement \"I am dead\" because the very act of proposing it presupposes the actor is alive.\n\nSolipsism is often held to be a performative contradiction if stated. If not stated it is usually considered an example of the normative application of \"qui tacet consentire videtur\" (He who remains silent vigorously consents).\nJürgen Habermas and related philosophers point out that statements spoken during justificatory argumentation carry additional presuppositions and so certain statements are performative contradictions in this context. Habermas claims that post-modernism's epistemological relativism suffers from a performative contradiction. Hans-Hermann Hoppe claims in his theory of argumentation ethics that arguing against self-ownership results in a performative contradiction.\n\nJaakko Hintikka more rigorously fleshed out the notion of performative contradiction in analyzing Descartes' famous \"cogito ergo sum\" argument, concluding that \"cogito ergo sum\" relies on performance rather than logical inference.\n\n\n"}

It also reached number seven on the Easy Listening chart. The song is one of the official anthems for the city of San Francisco. In 2018, it was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or artistically significant.\"\n\nThe music was written by George Cory, with lyrics by Douglass Cross, about two amateur writers nostalgic for San Francisco after moving to New York.\n\nAlthough the song was originally written for Claramae Turner, who often used it as an encore, she never got around to recording it. The song found its way to Tony Bennett through Ralph Sharon, Bennett's longtime accompanist and friends with the composers. Sharon brought the music along when he and Bennett were on tour and on their way to San Francisco's Fairmont Hotel.\n\nPrior to Tony Bennett hearing it, the song was pitched to Tennessee Ernie Ford, whom Claramae Turner suggested Cross take it to. Ford turned the song down.\n\nIn December 1961, in the famous \"Venetian Room\" at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco, Tony Bennett first sang \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\". In the audience that night were San Francisco mayor George Christopher and future mayor Joseph L. Alioto. From the 1960s through the 1980s, at San Francisco's premier supper club the \"Venetian Room,\" Bennett sang the city song.\n\nBennett first recorded the song at the CBS 30th Street Studio on January 23, 1962; CBS released it as the b-side of \"Once Upon A Time.\" The A-side received no attention, and DJs began flipping the record over and playing \"San Francisco.\" It became a hit on the pop singles chart in 1962 and spent close to a year on various other charts, achieving gold record status. It then won the top prize of Grammy Award for Record of the Year, as well as for Best Male Solo Vocal Performance.\n\nIn 2001 \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\" was ranked 23rd on an RIAA/NEA list of the most historically significant Songs of the 20th Century.\n\nIt has often been performed in public by Bennett in concert as well as on special occasions. A statue of Tony Bennett was unveiled outside the Fairmont Hotel on 19 August 2016, in honor of his 90th birthday, the hotel performance, and the song's history with San Francisco.\n\nThe Songwriters Hall of Fame gave Bennett the \"Towering Performance Award\" for his vocal rendition of the song.\n\nRhythm and blues singer Bobby Womack released a version on Minit Records which peaked at #48 on the \"Billboard\" R&B chart in 1969.\n\nOn May 15, 1984, the song was adopted by the City and County of San Francisco as one of its two official anthems, the other being the title song from the 1936 film \"San Francisco (1936 film)\".\n\nThe San Francisco Giants play the song after each victory at their home field, Oracle Park. Bennett has performed the song live at multiple Giants games, including the first game at Oracle (then called Pacific Bell Park) in 2000 and before games in the 2002 and 2010 World Series.\n\nAt noon (PDT) on Saturday, April 25, 2020, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic and the shelter-in-place orders for people across the United States, San Franciscan residents sang I Left My Heart in San Francisco in unison from their residences and other places of sheltering as a tribute to the spirit of the city and its fight to keep the virus in check.

He has been described as \"one of the most provocative names in American underground culture,\" and \"the father of remodernist cinema.\"\n\nJesse Richards was born in New Haven. He had an ambition to be a forest ranger during his teens, which was also the time he started to make films. He studied film production at the School of Visual Arts, New York City, which he left after a nervous breakdown. He directed plays including \"Hamlet\" and \"Look Back In Anger\" for the New Haven Theatre Company, and made short romance and punk films.\n\nIn 1999, Richards was arrested for reckless burning, destruction of property and disorderly conduct. After the charges were dropped, he began painting.\n\nRichards is affiliated with the Stuckist art movement in 2001 and founded a gallery as the first Stuckism center in the United States in 2002, helping to organize shows. The center opened its doors with a show entitled \"We Just Wanna Show Some Fucking Paintings.\"\n\nIn 2003, an anti-war \"Clown Trial of President Bush\" took place outside the New Haven Federal Courthouse, in order to \"highlight the fact that the Iraq War does not have the support of the United Nations, thus violating a binding contract with the UN\". It was staged by local Stuckist artists dressed in clown costume, led by Richards with Nicholas Watson and Tony Juliano. One of the participants was a public defender for the state of Connecticut.\n\nSimultaneously the Stuckism center opened a \"War on Bush\" show, including work from Brazil, Australia, Germany and the UK, while the London equivalent staged a \"War on Blair\" show. Richards said the original intention of a straightforward art show to an anti-war show had been changed after a phone discussion with Stuckism founder, Charles Thomson. Richards told \"The Yale Herald\", \"Duchamp would go over to the Yale University Art Gallery and he would say, 'This is crap,' and he would go paint a picture.\"\n\nAlso in 2003, Richards was an exhibitor in the UK show, \"Stuck in Wednesbury\" at Wednesbury Museum & Art Gallery, the first Stuckist show in a public gallery, and in \"The Stuckists Summer Show\" at the Stuckism International Gallery, London.\n\nIn 2004, Richards was one of eight artists in the \"International Stuckists\" section of \"The Stuckists Punk Victorian\" show at the Walker Art Gallery during the Liverpool Biennial. He said of his exhibited work, \"Nightlife\": \"This came out of heavy drinking and loneliness. New Haven's social scene is entirely going to bars, so it was my only way to meet new people.\"\n\nRichards reviewed the Biennial and the Stuckist show, where he found Joe Machine's \"My Grandfather Will Fight You\", \"one of the best Stuckist paintings. Machine's work is the epitome of raw, real expressive painting.\" He said that Stuckist Photographer Andy Bullock's work was \"silly installation photography\" which was \"trying to be trendy.\"\n\nIn 2005, 160 paintings from the Walker Art Gallery show, including one by Richards, were offered as a donation to the Tate gallery, but rejected by Sir Nicholas Serota, because \"We do not feel that the work is of sufficient quality in terms of accomplishment, innovation or originality of thought to warrant preservation in perpetuity in the national collection\".\n\nIn 2005, Richards was a co-ordinator of, and participated in, \"Addressing the Shadow and Making Friends with Wild Dogs: Remodernism\", the first Remodernism exhibition in the US to include work from all of the Remodernist groups, including the Stuckists, the Defastenists, Remodernist Film and Photography, and Stuckism Photography. The show took place at the CBGB 313 gallery.\n\nIn 2006, Richards was one of the artists in \"The Triumph of Stuckism\", a show at Liverpool John Moores University Hope Street Gallery, curated by Naive John at the invitation of Professor Colin Fallows, Chair of Research at Liverpool School of Art and Design, and part of the Liverpool Biennial 2006.\n\nRichards left the Stuckist movement in 2006.\n\nStuckist group shows organized or featuring work by Richards include:\n\nRichards has worked on films with Nicholas Watson since 1996. Their film noir, \"Blackout\", was premiered at the event \"Stuck Films\" at the New Haven Stuckism International Center in 2002.\n\nIn 2003, Richards co-produced \"Shooting at the Moon\", a short film premiering at the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival. In 2008, the film made its London premiere at Horse Hospital during its FLIXATION Underground Cinema Club event. Richards said that his films had previously often contained nudity, but this time he wanted to do the opposite and the two leads do not quite even kiss:\n\nA book of pinhole photography called \"Dark Chamber\", featuring new work by Richards as well as work by Wolf Howard, Billy Childish and others was published by Urban Fox Press in May 2007.\n\nBrian Sherwin said of Richards that his work was \"Street truth\":\n\nIn February 2010, the Australian film magazine Filmink announced Richards' participation in a compilation feature film by the Remodernist film movement. The film is scheduled to premiere in New York in December 2010.\n\nRichards announced in July 2010 that he joined a \"new international film collective\" called Subvex, which was initiated by Tobias Morgan, co-director of The Auteurs's Garage. \"Subvex is currently based in Paris and New York and advocates the occupation of new spaces for the projection of films that would otherwise struggle to receive distribution in a mainstream market, and emphasises the development of ground-level cultures around new waves in contemporary filmmaking\". In August 2010, Subvex announced its first project, an 8 mm film version of Exquisite Corpse, which will feature new work by Richards, Jonas Mekas, Bill Morrison, Nina Menkes, Lav Diaz, Ian Helliwell, Amos Poe and others. The collaboration is not-for-profit and is being financed through crowdsourcing.\n\nIn December 2010, Richards joined the Board of Directors of Cine Foundation International.\n\nRichards currently lives in Granby, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 2004, Richards and fellow filmmaker Harris Smith co-founded Remodernist Film and Photography, a new Remodernist group attempting to introduce Remodernist/Stuckist values into film and photography.\n\nIn 2008, Richards published a Remodernist Film Manifesto, calling for a \"new spirituality in cinema\" and the use of intuition in filmmaking. He described Remodernist film as a \"stripped down, minimal, lyrical, punk kind of filmmaking\". Point four of the manifesto is:\nThere were also criticisms of Stanley Kubrick, digital video, and Dogme 95.\n\nIn late August 2009, an International Alliance of Remodernist Filmmakers was started by Richards in order to promote discussion and collaboration amongst those following the manifesto. The filmmakers include Jesse Richards, Harris Smith, Christopher Michael Beer, Dmitri Trakovsky, Kate Shults, Peter Rinaldi and Khurrem Gold of America, Roy Rezaali of the Netherlands, Rouzbeh Rashidi of Iran and Dean Kavanagh of Ireland.\n\nIn October 2009, with the intention \"to further develop and explain Remodernist film concepts\", a series of articles by Richards, Peter Rinaldi and Roy Rezaali were published in the magazine MungBeing In Richards' two essays in the magazine, he explains the development of cinema in terms of modernism, postmodernism and remodernism, and discusses remodernist film craft as involving filmmakers \"teaching themselves to paint pictures, to try acting in their own movies and those of others (especially if they are shy), to be nude models for other artists, to meditate, worship if they are religious, to do things that affect their levels of consciousness, try things that make them nervous or uncomfortable, to go out and be involved in life, to find adventure, to jump in the ocean. I think that is the exploration of craft\". He also relaxes the criticisms made in the manifesto about digital video, claiming that can \"have a place in Remodernist cinema\", but with a \"new language\" and not in the way it is used now, which he says is to \"mimic film\".\n\nHe describes his specific approach to Remodernist filmmaking as well:\n\nThese things, these \"shadows\" that we are hiding within ourselves, need to be brought forth into the light of day – in our films, in our work, in our poetry. It's necessary for us to share these parts of ourselves so we and the people we share with can grow into complete, honest human beings. Now, this kind of brutal honesty about ourselves shown through imagery that isn't shy, has been explored to a degree in the work from the Cinema of Transgression, and is advocated by Antonin Artaud in his writings about the Theatre of Cruelty, and his later writings on cinema. But I don't think it's quite as simple as just that. As human beings, we are also full of beauty and love and poetry – we can see this in ourselves and in others and in the world around us. So this beauty must be explored as well, and in combination with the exploration of the shadow. The funny thing is that if we would just be honest as filmmakers, or painters, or as whatever we happen to work with, if we could be this honest, this approach would happen automatically. But we are told again and again- these things don't go together, don't tell people about that thing that you can't get out of your head- that image is inappropriate. We've become very afraid of just expressing ourselves honestly, of removing the desperate attempts to appear clever, we've been afraid of showing our true selves out of fear that others will think us fools. So this is where Artaud, the Cinema of Transgression, and even Andrei Tarkovsky have not gone quite the distance. The cinematic exploration of spirituality and transgression together – pubic hair, blood and shit and love and the green grass and the dying cherry blossoms, falling snow, passing trains – every single fucking beautiful piece of life – that is what my conception of Remodernist film is.\n\nThe articles also broaden the aim of the movement, explaining the common bond among Remodernist filmmakers being a search for truth, knowledge, authenticity and spirituality in their work, but having different approaches on achieving that goal.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1872984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872984", "title": "Vestry", "text": "Vestry\n\nA vestry was a committee for the local secular and ecclesiastical government for a parish in England and Wales, which originally met in the vestry or sacristy of the parish church, and consequently became known colloquially as the \"vestry\".\n\nFor many centuries the vestries were the sole \"de facto\" local government and presided over local, communal fundraising and expenditure until the mid or late 19th century with local Established Church chairmanship. More punitive matters tended to be dealt with by the manorial court and hundred court during the epoch of the vestries. Their initial power derived from custom and was very occasionally ratified by the common law or asserted in statute such as the Elizabethan Poor Law. At the high point of their powers before removal of Poor Law responsibilities in 1834, the vestries spent not far short of one-fifth of the budget of the British government which derived much of its income from global trade and imperialism.\n\nSecular and ecclesiastical aspects of the vestries were separated, for all areas where they had not earlier been, under a reforming statute of 1894. Their secular duties have been performed in England since then by parish councils or more superior councils, leaving their ecclesiastical duties to the Church of England where they have been performed by parochial church councils (PCCs) since 1921. Realised secularisation of local government was opposed by administrations of the Tory Party preceding the Third Salisbury ministry, the British government led by Lord Salisbury from 1895 to 1900 and several earlier influential High Whigs.\n\nA public right in the PCC (church) meeting remains in that all Members of an overlapping civil parish can speak at their annual meetings (which may appoint churchwardens for instance). A right to tax by a PCC for church chancel repairs remains as to liable (apportioned) local residents and businesses across an apportioned area of many church parishes, in the form of chancel repair liability however in some tithes were replaced by no further such taxation.\n\nThe term vestry remains in use outside of England and Wales to refer to the elected governing body and legal representative of a parish church, for example in the Scottish and American Episcopal Churches. \n\nThe vestry was a meeting of the parish ratepayers chaired by the incumbent of the parish, originally held in the parish church or its vestry, from which it got its name.\n\nThe vestry committees were not established by any law, but they evolved independently in each parish according to local needs from their roots in medieval parochial governance. By the late 17th century they had become, along with the county magistrates, the rulers of rural England.\n\nIn England, until the 19th century, the parish vestry committee equated to today's parochial church councils plus all local government responsible for secular local business, which is now the responsibility of a District Council as well as in some areas a Civil Parish Council, and other activities, such as administering locally the poor law.\nThe original unit of settlement among the Anglo-Saxons in England was the \"tun\" or town. The inhabitants met to carry out this business in the town moot or meeting, at which they empowered or tasked men with various positions and the common law would be promulgated. Later with the rise of the shire, the township would send its reeve and four best men to represent it in the courts of the hundred and shire. However, township independence in the Saxon system was lost to the feudal manorial court leet which replaced the town meeting.\n\nAssembly of parishes rested on land ownership, so increasingly the manorial system, with parishes assembled by lords of the manor in concert with local clergy and religious institutions by serving via a new church a manor, or more than one manor plus commons, barren land (waste) and land set aside for church benefit as rectory or vicarage lands (glebelands). Initially, the manor was the principal unit of local administration, common customs and justice in the rural economy, but over time the church replaced the manorial court as to key elements of rural life and improvement — it levied its local tax on produce, tithes. Much subinfeudation, division of manors and a new mercantile middle class had widely eroded the old feudal model by the early Tudor period and which changes nationally accelerated with the Reformation in the 1530s seeing the sequestration of religious houses and the greatest estates of the church, but also under Mary I and others a turning to the parish system to attend to social and economic needs. These changes transformed participation in the township or parish meeting, which dealt with an increasing variety of civil and ecclesiastical demands, needs and projects. This new meeting was supervised by the parish priest (vicar/rector/curate), probably the best educated of the inhabitants, and became generally dubbed the vestry meeting.\n\nAs the complexity of rural society increased, the vestry meetings pragmatically acquired greater responsibilities, and were given the power to grant or deny payments from parish funds. Although the vestry committees were not established by any law, and had come into being in an unregulated ad-hoc process, it was highly convenient to allow them to develop. This was convenient when they were the obvious body for administering the Edwardian and Elizabethan systems for support of the poor on a parochial basis. This was their first, and for many centuries their principal, statutory power.\n\nWith this gradual formalisation of civil responsibilities, the ecclesiastical parishes acquired a dual nature and could be classed as both civil and ecclesiastical parishes. In England, until the 19th century, the parish vestry was in effect what would today usually be called a parochial church council, but was also responsible for all the secular parish business now dealt with by civil bodies, such as parish councils.\n\nEventually, the vestry assumed a variety of tasks. It became responsible for appointing parish officials, such as the parish clerk, overseers of the poor, sextons and scavengers, constables and nightwatchmen.\n\nAt the high point of their powers, just prior to removal of Poor Law responsibilities in 1834, the vestries spent not far short of one-fifth of the budget of the national government itself. More than 15,600 ecclesiastical parish vestries looked after their own:\nchurches and burial grounds, parish cottages and workhouses, endowed charities, market crosses, pumps, pounds, whipping posts, stocks, cages, watch houses, weights and scales, clocks and fire engines.\nOr to put it another way: the maintenance of the church and its services, the keeping of the peace, the repression of vagrancy, the relief of destitution, the mending of roads, the suppression of nuisances, the destruction of vermin, the furnishing of soldiers and sailors, even to some extent the enforcement of religious and moral discipline. These were among the multitudinous duties imposed on the parish and its officers, that is to say the vestry and its organisation, by the law of the land, and by local custom and practice as the situation demanded.\n\nThis level of activity had resulted in an increasing sophistication of administration. The decisions and accounts of the vestry committee would be administered by the parish clerk, and records of parish business would be stored in a \"parish chest\" kept in the church and provided for security with three different locks, the individual keys to which would be held by such as the parish priest and churchwardens.\n\nWhilst the vestry was a general meeting of all inhabitant rate-paying householders in a parish, in the 17th century the huge growth of population in some parishes, mostly urban, made it increasingly difficult to convene and conduct meetings. Consequently, in some of these a new body, the select vestry, was created. This was an administrative committee of selected parishioners whose members generally had a property qualification and who were recruited largely by co-option. This took responsibility from the community at large and improved efficiency, but over time tended to lead to governance by a self-perpetuating elite. This committee was also known as the \"close vestry\", whilst the term \"open vestry\" was used for the meeting of all ratepayers.\n\nBy the late 17th century, the existence of a number of autocratic and corrupt select vestries had become a national scandal, and several bills were introduced to parliament in the 1690s, but none became acts. There was continual agitation for reform, and in 1698 to keep the debate alive the House of Lords insisted that a bill to reform the select vestries, the Select Vestries Bill, would always be the first item of business of the Lords in a new parliament until a reform bill was passed. The First Reading of the bill was made annually, but every year it never got any further. This continues to this day as an archaic custom in the Lords to assert the independence from the Crown, even though the select vestries have long been abolished.\n\n \nA major responsibility of the vestry had been the administration of the Poor Law, but the widespread unemployment following the Napoleonic Wars overwhelmed the vestries, and under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 this duty was transferred to elected boards of guardians for single parishes or to poor law unions for larger areas. These new bodies now received the poor law levy and administered the system, and removed a large portion of the income of the vestry and a significant part of its duties.\n\nThe vestries escaped the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which brought more democratic and open processes to municipal bodies, but there was gradual movement to separate the vestry's ecclesiastical and secular duties. The Vestries Act 1850 prevented the holding of meeting in churches, and in London, vestries were incorporated under the Metropolis Management Act 1855 to create properly regulated civil bodies for London parishes, but they did not have any ecclesiastical duties.\n\nAs the 19th century progressed the parish vestry progressively lost its secular duties to the increasing number of local boards which came into being and operated across greater areas than single parishes for a specific purpose. These were able to levy their own rate. Among these were the local boards of health created under the Public Health Act 1848, the Burial boards, which took over responsibility for secular burials in 1853, and the Sanitary Districts which were established in 1875. The church rate ceased to be levied in many parishes and was made voluntary in 1868.\n\nHowever, the proliferation of these local bodies led to a confusing fragmentation of local government responsibilities, and this became a driver for large scale reform in local government, which resulted in the Local Government Act 1894. The problem of so many local bodies was expressed by H H Fowler, President of the Local Government Board, who said in the parliamentary debate for the 1894 Act...\n\nUnder the Act, secular and ecclesiastical duties were finally separated when a system of elected rural parish councils and urban district councils was introduced. This removed all secular matters from the parish vestries, and created parish councils or parish meetings to manage these. The parish vestries were left with only church affairs to manage.\n\nFollowing the removal of civil powers in 1894, the vestry meetings continued to administer church matters in Church of England parishes until the Parochial Church Councils (Powers) Measure 1921 Act established parochial church councils as their successors. Since then, the only remnant of the vestry meeting has been the meeting of parishioners, which is convened annually solely for the election of churchwardens of the ecclesiastical parish. This is sometime referred to as the \"annual vestry meeting\". All other roles of the vestry meetings are now undertaken by parochial church councils.\n\nThe term \"vestry\" continues to be used in some other denominations for a body of lay members elected by the congregation to run the business of a church parish, such as in the Scottish and American Episcopal Churches. In the American Episcopal church, vestry members are generally elected annually and serve as the legal representatives of the church . Within the Church of Ireland the term \"select vestry\" is used to describe the members of the parish who are elected to conduct the affairs of the parish.\n\nThe Vestries Acts 1818 to 1853 is the collective title of the following Acts:\n\n\n\n"}

Such corrections typically become important when a significant number of electrons reach speeds greater than 0.86c (Lorentz factor formula_1=2).\n\nSuch plasmas may be created either by heating a gas to very high temperatures or by the impact of a high-energy particle beam. A relativistic plasma with a thermal distribution function has temperatures greater than around 260 keV, or 3.0 GK (5.5 billion degrees Fahrenheit), where approximately 10% of the electrons have formula_2. Since these temperatures are so high, most relativistic plasmas are small and brief, and are often the result of a relativistic beam impacting some target. (More mundanely, \"relativistic plasma\" might denote a normal, cold plasma moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to the observer.)\n\nRelativistic plasmas may result when two particle beams collide at speeds comparable to the speed of light, and in the cores of supernovae. Plasmas hot enough for particles other than electrons to be relativistic are even more rare, since other particles are more massive and thus require more energy to accelerate to a significant fraction of the speed of light. (About 10% of protons would have formula_3 at a temperature of 481 MeV - 5.6 TK.) Still higher energies are necessary to achieve a quark–gluon plasma.\n\nThe primary changes in a plasma's behavior as it approaches the relativistic regime is slight modifications to the equations which describe a non-relativistic plasma and to collision and interaction cross sections. The equations may also need modifications to account for pair production of electron-positron pairs (or other particles at the highest temperatures).\n\nA plasma double layer with a large potential drop and layer separation, may accelerate electrons to relativistic velocities, and produce synchrotron radiation.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1873016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873016", "title": "History of Internet Explorer", "text": "History of Internet Explorer\n\nMicrosoft has developed eleven versions of Internet Explorer for Windows from 1995 to 2013. Microsoft has also developed Internet Explorer for Mac, Internet Explorer for UNIX and Internet Explorer Mobile respectively for Apple Macintosh, Unix and mobile devices. The first two are discontinued but the latter runs on Windows CE, Windows Mobile and Windows Phone.\n\nThe first Internet Explorer was derived from Spyglass Mosaic. The original Mosaic came from NCSA, but since NCSA was a public entity it relied on Spyglass as its commercial licensing partner. Spyglass in turn delivered two versions of the Mosaic browser to Microsoft, one wholly based on the NCSA source code, and another engineered from scratch but conceptually modeled on the NCSA browser. Internet Explorer was initially built using the Spyglass, not the NCSA source code. The license to Microsoft provided Spyglass (and thus NCSA) with a quarterly fee plus a percentage of Microsoft's revenues for the software.\n\nThe browser was then modified and released as Internet Explorer. Microsoft originally released Internet Explorer 1.0 in August 1995 in two packages: at retail in Microsoft Plus! add-on for Windows 95 and via the simultaneous OEM release of Windows 95. Version 1.5 was released several months later for Windows NT, with support for basic table rendering, an important early web standard. Version 2.0 was released for both Windows 95 and Windows NT in November 1995, featuring support for SSL, cookies, VRML, and Internet newsgroups. Version 2.0 was also released for the Macintosh and Windows 3.1 in April 1996. Version 2 was also included in Microsoft's \"Internet Starter Kit for Windows 95\" in early 1996, which retailed for US$19.99 and included a how-to book and 30 days of Internet access on MSN among other features. Internet Explorer 3.0 was released free of charge in August 1996 by bundling it with Windows 95, another OEM release. Microsoft thus made no direct revenues on IE and was liable to pay Spyglass only the minimum quarterly fee. In 1997, Spyglass threatened Microsoft with a contractual audit, in response to which Microsoft settled for US$8 million. Version 3 included Internet Mail and News 1.0 and the Windows Address Book. It also brought the browser much closer to the bar that had been set by Netscape, including the support of Netscape's plugins technology (NPAPI), ActiveX, frames, and a reverse-engineered version of JavaScript named JScript. Later, Microsoft NetMeeting and Windows Media Player were integrated into the product and thus helper applications became not as necessary as they once were. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) were also introduced with version 3 of Internet Explorer.\n\nVersion 4 released in September 1997, was shipped with Windows 95 OSR (OEM Service Release) 2.5, and the latest beta version of Windows 98 and was modified to integrate more closely with Microsoft Windows. It included an option to enable \"Active Desktop\" which displayed World Wide Web content on the desktop itself and was updated automatically as the content changed. The user could select other pages for use as Active Desktops as well. \"Active Channel\" technology was also introduced to automatically obtain information updates from websites. The technology was based on an XML standard known as Channel Definition Format (CDF), which predated the currently used web syndication formats like RSS. This version was designed to work on Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT, and could be downloaded from the Internet, free of charge. It supported Dynamic HTML (DHTML). Outlook Express 4.0 also came integrated into the browser and replaced the aging Microsoft Internet Mail & News product that was released with previous versions. Version 5 came out in March 1999, following Microsoft's release of Internet Explorer 5.0 Beta versions in late 1998 . Bi-directional text, ruby text and direct XML/XSLT support were included in this release, along with enhanced support for CSS Level 1 and 2. The actual release of Internet Explorer 5 happened in three stages. Firstly, a Developer Preview was released in June 1998 (5.0B1), and then a Public Preview was released in November 1998 (5.0B2). Then in March 1999 the final release was released (5.0). In September it was released with Windows 98. Version 5.0 was the last one to be released for Windows 3.1x or Windows NT 3.x. Internet Explorer 5.5 was later released for Windows Me in July 2000, and included many bug fixes and security patches. Version 5.5 was the last to have \"Compatibility Mode\", which allowed Internet Explorer 4 to be run side by side with the 5.x. With IE6, there was a quirks mode that could be triggered to make it behave like IE5.5 Version 6 was released with Windows XP on August 27, 2001. It mainly focused on privacy and security features, as they had become customer priorities. Microsoft implemented tools that support P3P, a technology under development by the W3C.\n\nIn a legal case brought by the US Department of Justice and twenty U.S. states, Microsoft was accused of breaking an earlier consent decree, by bundling Internet Explorer with its operating system software. The department took issue with Microsoft's contract with OEM computer manufacturers that bound the manufacturers to include Internet Explorer with the copies of Microsoft Windows they installed on systems they shipped. It would not allow the manufacturer to put an icon for any other web browser on the default desktop in place of Internet Explorer. Microsoft maintained that integration of its web browser into its operating system was in the interests of consumers.\n\nMicrosoft asserted in court that IE was integrated with Windows 98, and that Windows 98 could not be made to operate without it. Australian computer scientist Shane Brooks later demonstrated that Windows 98 could in fact run with IE files removed. Brooks went on to develop software designed to customize Windows by removing \"undesired components\", which is now known as LitePC. Microsoft has claimed that the software did not remove \"all\" components of Internet Explorer, leaving many dynamic link library files behind.\n\nOn April 3, 2000, Judge Jackson issued his \"findings of fact\" that Microsoft had abused its monopoly position by attempting to \"dissuade Netscape from developing Navigator as a platform\", that it \"withheld crucial technical information\", and attempted to reduce Navigator's usage share by \"giving Internet Explorer away and rewarding firms that helped build its usage share\" and \"excluding Navigator from important distribution channels\".\n\nJackson also released a \"remedy\" that suggested Microsoft should be broken up into two companies. This remedy was overturned on appeal, amidst charges that Jackson had revealed a bias against Microsoft in communication with reporters. The findings of fact that Microsoft had broken the law, however, were upheld. Seven months later, the Department of Justice agreed on a settlement agreement with Microsoft. As of 2004, although nineteen states have agreed to the settlement, Massachusetts is still holding out.\n\nIn a May 7, 2003 Microsoft online chat, Brian Countryman, Internet Explorer Program Manager, declared that on Microsoft Windows, Internet Explorer would cease to be distributed separately from the operating system (IE 6 being the last standalone version); it would, however, be continued as a part of the evolution of the operating system, with updates coming bundled in operating system upgrades. Thus, Internet Explorer and Windows itself would be kept more in sync.\n\nNew feature work did continue in 2003 during the development of Windows Vista; a preview release was released at the Professional Developers Conference in October 2003 which contained an updated Internet Explorer with a version number of 6.05. New features noted by reviewers included a Download Manager, pop-up blocker, add-on manager and a tool to clear browsing history. With the exception of the download manager, which was eventually discarded, these features all appeared in builds of Internet Explorer included with preview builds of Windows XP Service Pack 2 a few months later.\n\nWindows XP Service Pack 2, which was released in August 2004 after a number of delays, also contained a number of security-related fixes, new restrictions on code execution, and user interface elements that aimed to better protect the user from malware. One notable user interface element that was introduced was the \"information bar\". Tony Schriner, a developer on the Internet Explorer team, explained that the information bar was introduced to reduce the possibility that the user might mis-click and allow the installation of software they did not intend, as well as to simply reduce the number of pop-ups displayed to the user. Most reviews of this release focused on the addition of the pop-up blocker, as it had been seen as a major omission at a time when pop-up ads had become a major source of irritation for web users.\n\nOn December 19, 2005, Microsoft announced that it would no longer support Internet Explorer for the Macintosh, and recommended using other Macintosh browsers such as Safari.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2009 Internet Explorer market share slowly declined, and the policy change (announced in 2003) of only releasing new versions with new versions of the Windows operating system was reversed with plans for IE7. In 2006, five years after the release of IE 6, beta versions of Version 7.0 were released, and version 7 was released that October (the same month as Firefox 2.0). Internet Explorer was renamed Windows Internet Explorer, as part of Microsoft's rebranding of component names that are included with Windows. It was available as part of Windows Vista, and as a separate download via Microsoft Update for Windows XP with Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1. Internet Explorer 7 was also available for download directly from Microsoft's website. Large amounts of the underlying architecture, including the rendering engine and security framework, had been completely overhauled. Partly as a result of security enhancements, the browser became a stand-alone application, rather than integrated with the Windows shell, and was no longer capable of acting as a file browser. The first security advisory was posted only one day after the day of release, but it turned out to be a security problem in Outlook Express, not in Internet Explorer 7. The first vulnerability exclusive to Internet Explorer 7 was posted after 6 days. In March 2009 Version 8.0 was released, with the first public beta having been released on March 5, 2008. IE8 offered better support for web standards than previous versions, with plans for improved support for RSS, CSS, and Ajax, as well as full compliance for Cascading Style Sheets 2.1. It was also the first version to successfully pass the Acid2 test. In addition, Internet Explorer 8 included new features such as \"WebSlices\" and an improved phishing filter.\n\nWith Google's popular Chrome browser steadily gaining popularity due to its speed, simplicity, and support of newer technologies like HTML5, Microsoft released Internet Explorer 9 in September 2010, marketing it as showcasing the \"Beauty of the Web;\" Internet Explorer 9 offered features intended to enhance web browsing, such as partial HTML5 support, hardware acceleration, and better Windows integration. Adobe released a beta version of Flash 10.2 tailored to take advantage of Internet Explorer 9's built-in hardware acceleration capabilities on November 30, 2010. Microsoft tried to make Internet Explorer simpler to use (and thus more desirable) than its competitors, and added features such as the ability to drag URLs and bookmarks to the Windows Taskbar, a unified downloads manager, a redesigned new tab page featuring your most recently visited sites, and the ability to \"tear\" tabs away from a window, or drag them away vertically to create their own window. All of these functions already existed on alternate browsers though, such as Opera, Google Chrome and Firefox, and a lot of these functions look similar to what other browsers already had.\n\nWhen it released in December 2010, Internet Explorer 9 required Windows Vista SP2 or later, in a time when 44% of computers still ran Windows XP. The marketing strategy or lack of cross-platform support was met with criticism, and backfired with Microsoft Edge's slow adoption on Windows 10. Google Chrome imposed no such restrictions, supporting Windows XP until 2014.\n\nOn September 30, 2014, Microsoft, during a media event, announced the next version of Windows, under the name Windows 10. At that time, it was announced that Windows 10 would be the last completely new version of Windows, but Windows would still live on as more of a service with continuous improvements over its foreseeable future. During the event, a successor to Internet Explorer was announced, under the codename \"Project Spartan\". This meant the inevitable death of Internet Explorer after nearly 20 years, though this fact was not initially stated during the launch of Windows 10.\n\nLater, the new interface and render engine for Project Spartan were leaked to Insiders in a developer preview of Windows 10, which could be enabled in Internet Explorer on Windows 10. On the same date as the launch of the new interface, a page on Microsoft's website announced the new name for Project Spartan—Microsoft Edge.\n\nWindows 10 was released on July 29, 2015 as a free upgrade to existing Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 customers. While Microsoft Edge was featured front-and-center, Internet Explorer 11 remains available to use in the new OS for compatibility purposes, although it is hidden in the Windows Accessories folder. A notable trace of Internet Explorer, though, exists in that the platform version number of the EdgeHTML rendering engine in the first release, version 12, clearly continues the numbering scheme of the predecessor Trident engine used in IE.\n\nThe adoption rate of Internet Explorer seems to be closely related to that of Microsoft Windows, as it is the default web browser that comes with Windows. Since the integration of Internet Explorer 2.0 with Windows 95 OSR 1 in 1996, and especially after version 4.0's release, the adoption was greatly accelerated: from below 20% in 1996 to about 40% in 1998 and over 80% in 2000.\n\nA CNN article noted at the release of Internet Explorer 4: \"Microsoft's Internet Explorer has made inroads and various estimates put its share of the browser market 30 to 35 percent from about 10 percent a year ago.\" By 2002, Internet Explorer had almost completely superseded its main rival Netscape and dominated the market with up to 95 percent market share.\nAfter having fought and won the browser wars of the late 1990s, Internet Explorer gained almost total dominance of the browser market. Having attained a peak of about 95% during 2002 and 2003, its market share has since declined at a slow but steady pace. Usage is higher in Asia and lower in Europe.\n\nFirefox 1.0 had surpassed Internet Explorer 5 in early 2005 with Firefox 1.0 at roughly 8 percent market share.\nAn article notes at the release of Internet Explorer 7 in October 2006 that \"IE6 had the lion's share of the browser market with 77.22%. Internet Explorer 7 had climbed to 3.18%, while Firefox 2.0 was at 0.69%.\"\n\nInternet Explorer 7 was released at the same time as Firefox 2.0, and overtook Firefox 1.x by November 2006, at roughly 9% market share. Firefox 2.0 had overtaken 1.x by January 2007, but IE7 did not surpass IE6 until December 2007. By January 2008, their respective version market share stood at 43% IE7, 32% IE6, 16% FF2, 4% Safari 3 and both FF1.x and IE5 versions at less than half a percent.\n\nApproximate usage over time based on various usage share counters averaged for the year overall, or for the fourth quarter, or for the last month in the year depending on availability of reference.\n\nAccording to StatCounter Internet Explorer's marketshare fell below 50% in September 2010. In May 2012 it was announced that Google Chrome overtook Internet Explorer as the most used browser worldwide.\n\nApproximate usage over time based on various usage share counters averaged for the year overall, or for the fourth quarter, or for the last month in the year depending on availability of reference.\n\nBrowser Helper Objects are also used by many search engine companies and third parties for creating add-ons that access their services, such as search engine toolbars. Because of the use of COM, it is possible to embed web-browsing functionality in third-party applications. Hence, there are a number of Internet Explorer shells, and a number of content-centric applications like RealPlayer also use Internet Explorer's web browsing module for viewing web pages within the applications.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1873017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873017", "title": "Boxcar Bertha", "text": "Boxcar Bertha\n\nBoxcar Bertha is a low budget 1972 American romantic crime drama film directed by Martin Scorsese. It is a loose adaptation of \"Sister of the Road\", a pseudo-autobiographical account of the fictional character Bertha Thompson, written by Ben L. Reitman. It was Scorsese's second feature film.\n\nThe film tells the story of Boxcar Bertha Thompson and \"Big\" Bill Shelly, two train robbers and lovers who are caught up in the plight of railroad workers in the American South. When Bertha is implicated in the murder of a wealthy gambler, the pair become fugitives.\n\n\nAfter the success of \"Bloody Mama\", Roger Corman wanted to make another female gangster film. Julie Corman researched female gangsters and came across the story of Boxcar Bertha. Martin Scorsese was hired to direct on the strength of his first feature. He was given the lead actors, including Barbara Hershey, David Carradine, and Barry Primus, and a shooting schedule of 24 days in Arkansas. The Reader Railroad was used for the train scenes.\n\nThe locomotive in those scenes was 1920 Baldwin 2-6-2 #108, who later saw service on the Conway Scenic Railroad in the late 1970s. The engine is currently at the Blacklands Railroad yard in Sulphur Springs, Texas, awaiting restoration. Locomotive #1702, a USATC S160 2-8-0 built by Baldwin in 1942, was also seen in the film as well. The locomotive is now operational at the Great Smoky Mountains Railroad.\n\nScorsese makes a cameo in the film as one of Bertha's clients during the brothel montage.\n\nHershey later called the film \"a lot of fun even though it's terribly crippled by Roger Corman and the violence and sex. But between the actors and Marty Scorsese the director, we had a lot of fun. We really had characters down but one tends to not see all that, because you end up seeing all the blood and sex.\"\n\n\"Boxcar Bertha\" received mixed reviews from critics. It holds a rating of 52% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 23 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The website's critical consensus says, \"Too derivative of other Roger Corman crime pictures to stand out, \"Boxcar Bertha\" feels more like a training exercise for a fledgling Martin Scorsese than a fully formed picture in its own right.\"\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and called it \"a weirdly interesting movie ... Director Martin Scorsese has gone for mood and atmosphere more than for action, and his violence is always blunt and unpleasant — never liberating and exhilarating, as the New Violence is supposed to be. We get the feeling we're inhabiting the dark night of a soul.\" Howard Thompson of \"The New York Times\" found the film an \"interesting surprise,\" with an \"excellent\" performance by Carradine and \"beautiful\" direction by Scorsese, \"who really comes into his own here.\" Arthur D. Murphy of \"Variety\" was negative, writing, \"Whatever its intentions, \"Boxcar Bertha\" is not much more than an excuse to slaughter a lot of people ... The final cut has stripped away whatever mood and motivation may have been in the script, leaving little more than fights, shotgun blasts, beatings and aimless movement.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film 1 star out of 4 and called it a \"trashy movie\" with violence that \"does not shock. It merely depresses.\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"What is most impressive about \"Boxcar Bertha\" ... is how 28-year old director Martin Scorsese, in his first Hollywood venture, has managed to shape such familiar material into a viable film.\" Tom Milne of \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" declared: \"Abrasively scripted, stunningly shot, and beautifully acted by David Carradine, Barbara Hershey and Barry Primus in particular, \"Boxcar Bertha\" is much more than the exploitation picture it has been written off as (by \"Variety,\" for instance) and makes a worthy companion piece to both \"Bloody Mama\" and \"Bonnie and Clyde.\"\"\n\n\n"}
