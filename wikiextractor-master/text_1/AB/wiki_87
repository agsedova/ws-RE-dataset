It inherited facilities and resources from Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited (AWA) and Cable & Wireless, and was charged with responsibility for all international telecommunications services into, through and out of Australia. In effect, all overseas telecommunications was nationalized. Australia was adopting a Commonwealth-wide policy that had been adopted the Commonwealth conference in 1945. The main goal was to end the artificial routing of traffic to cable or wireless depending on private financial profits.\n\nOn 1 February 1992 it was merged with Australia’s domestic telecommunications carrier, the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Limited (\"Telecom\") to create the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Limited (AOTC). The new organisation underwent a corporate identity review and was subsequently renamed Telstra Corporation Limited (\"Telstra\").\n\nWhen first established in 1946, OTC inherited facilities which had been depleted during World War II, and faced rising costs and falling profits. From this tenuous beginning, the organisation was to grow over the years to gain world standing on the international telecommunications stage.\n\nThroughout rapid developments in undersea cable networks, global satellite systems and burgeoning digital technologies, OTC maintained a keen watch over its services to ensure continued quality. It also maintained and developed its links with maritime services, one of the initial arms of Australia’s international telecommunications network.\n\nWhen first established by an Act of Parliament in 1946, Australia's international telecommunications carrier – OTC – inherited facilities which had been depleted during World War II, and faced rising costs and falling profits. From this tenuous beginning, the organisation was to grow over the years to gain world standing on the international telecommunications stage.\n\nOTC's history shows how, by internal restructuring, upgrading its public image, making long-term investments in technologies and networks, and becoming a major player in international cooperative efforts, it played a vital role in the provision of Australia's international communications.\n\nThroughout rapid developments in undersea cable networks, global satellite systems and burgeoning digital technologies, OTC maintained a keen watch over its services to ensure continued quality.

{"id": "2025660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2025660", "title": "Musical fountain", "text": "Musical fountain\n\nA musical fountain, also known as a dancing fountain, is a type of animated fountain for entertainment purposes that creates an aesthetic design (including three-dimensional images). This is achieved by employing the effects of timed sound waves and timed light (including laser) against water particles. The water refracts and reflects the light, and in doing so, three-dimensional images can be produced.\n\nInstallations can be large scale, employing hundreds of water jets and lights, and costing into the millions of dollars, or in smaller household forms, where a budget of one thousand dollars is feasible. Musical features tend to be complex, and require a degree of mechanical, hydraulic, electrical, and electronic components out of view that might be as impressive to its audience as the show itself.\n\nThe earliest musical fountains were played manually by a live operator, who usually controlled pumps or valves and sometimes lights by way of switches on a control panel. Music was almost always live. Later, choreography could be prerecorded on a punched paper card which was scanned by a computer; and even later, it could be recorded on magnetic tape or, in the most modern shows, on a CD along with the music. Even so, the choreography is still usually painstakingly programmed by hand, some types of shows being played live from a control console and connected to a computer that records the operator's actions for later automatic playback. Recent advances in technology provides for unattended automatic choreography that can rival manual programming.\n\nPéter Bodor was a Hungarian gadgeteer and mechanical engineer (born on June 22, 1788, died August 17, 1849) who built a musical or chiming fountain in the Transylvanian town of Marosvásárhely (now Târgu Mureş, Romania) between 1820 and 1822.\n\nHis fountain (see pictures here) had a round floor-plan, with two arched stairs on the sides, and a dome roof supported by pillars. The mechanical core was a hydraulic structure driven by the force of water that played popular chimes at every hour. There was a gilded Neptune (or Apollo) statue on the top, that turned round in 24 hours. The fountain was destroyed in 1836 by a snow storm, and was never restored. However, an almost identical copy was built in Budapest's Margit Island in 1936 that did not operate by hydraulic means, but used electricity instead. This latter was partly destroyed during the Second World War, but was restored in 1954 and again in 1997. Now it is a tourist attraction that plays music at every hour during the day.\n\nKřižík's light fountain was built by the Czech inventor and electrical engineer František Křižík in 1891 on the occasion of the World Exhibition in Prague. It became a unique European attraction. The fountain was rebuilt in the 1920s by architect Z. Stašek. The bottom of the fountain plate is equipped with 1300 multicolored reflectors and water circuits composed of more than two kilometers of pipes with almost 3000 nozzles. In June 2018, the fountain has interrupted its operation.\n\nPrismatic Fountain, Denver, Colorado - May 30, 1908\n\"Mayor Robert W. Speer and F.W. Darlington, an engineer with the Denver Interurban Railway, dedicate the new marvel in City Park Lake--The Prismatic Electric Fountain. The Fountain features electric lighting effects that have not been seen before by the public. Eleven columns of brightly coloured light stream through the dramatic changing patterns of water. High in the north tower of the City Park Pavilion, an operator sits at a roll top desk, moving levers to undulate the twelve sets of water features and make the columns of light change color to the sounds of the Denver Municipal Band.\"\n\nF.W. Darlington was a pioneer in electrical fountain control as well as water design. \n\"Darlington had several signature water feature elements in his fountain designs. The multiple spray rings with \"basket-weave\" nozzle placement is one that shows up in photographs of several fountains, including some not yet credited to Darlington. The \"fan\" effect, a complicated triple spray ring with multiple nozzle sizes and angles is yet another water effect seen in several \"Electric Fountains.\" \n\nPrismatic Fountain, New Orleans, Louisiana - 1915\n\nThe Darlington fountain in New Orleans' West End and was likely completed around 1915 or 1916 as the last date on the original drawings are from February 1915. The fountain served as an icon for the West End Park and surrounding yacht clubs and numerous restaurants that were located in the area.\n\nAll of Darlington's fountains required an operator to change the water effects and lighting and were likely used in conjunction with music played by a band or orchestra for special events. It is unknown if the fountain was operated in a static mode when there were no performances or if it was shut off.\n\nRestoration of this fountain is planned by the Friends of West End in New Orleans.\n\nGarfield Park, Indianapolis, Indiana - 1916\n\nIn 1915, the new greenhouses and conservatory were built. The dedication of the Sunken Garden took place October 29, 1916. In 1916, Darlington was hired to design and build the fountains at the east end of the Sunken Garden. The fountains were the first in the country to be equipped with the mechanics that allowed the changing of the spray and displayed lights, according to the season and holiday. For Memorial Day, the fountain's lights were alight with red, white, and blue, and on other days, gold and white. Today, the fountains are still an attraction for visitors. This fountain was restored by The Fountain People in 1997 and with a musical control system by Atlantic Fountains in 2003.\n\nPool of Industry, 1939 New York World's Fair\n\nAn early notable example of a musical fountain choreographed live was the Pool of Industry at the 1939 New York World Fair, where three operators controlled the fountain, guided by a paper program that unscrolled under a glass window like the paper roll of a player piano - rather than controlling the effects directly like a piano roll, it was marked with commands that told the operators when to push the buttons and throw the switches. This fountain was more than just water and lights, however. Besides 3 million watts of lights and a gigantic pool containing 1,400 water nozzles, there were over 400 gas jets with a mechanism that caused colored flames and fireworks were shot from over 350 launchers, creating a nighttime spectacle on a grand scale. Music was played live by the fair's band and broadcast by large speakers to the areas surrounding the display. The updated show displayed at the same fairgrounds in 1964 lacked the colored flames but used punched cards for the choreography, had prerecorded music, and utilized the then-revolutionary system of dichroic light filtering (developed by Bausch and Lomb for the fountain) which now allowed a dark colored lens and a light colored lens to produce the same brightness of light. It was by this process that 700,000 watts of light produced over 3 megacandelas. This show also had single lights with multiple sliding color filters for mixing colors, and arrays of nozzles that could be adjusted, their direction changed by hydraulic or pneumatic actuators.\n\nThe Dancing Waters style of water show is a linear display of pumps and lights. In the United States, similar fountains are the Musical Waters. Musical Waters shows use the basic Dancing Waters mechanics. The fountains use single-speed pumps and do not offer variable water heights, and the revolving nozzles are not present since the Dancing Waters design having been prone to jamming. Despite lacking the rotating nozzles that usually define this type of show, the Musical Waters shows are one of the few of this kind that still retain most of the simple elegance that defined Otto Przystawik's first fountains, including the visual attraction of the human element with live \"fountaineers\" controlling the effects. Otto Przystawik water shows went well beyond previous musical fountains. While previous fountain merely change scenes during a performance, Przystawik introduced moving water that that created the first true Dancing Fountains.\nOther United States based companies such as Waltzing Waters Inc, owned by Przystawik's family, WET (Water Entertainment Technologies), Fontana Fountains, Atlantic Fountains, Fountain People, Formosa Fountains, Hall Fountains, and Waterworks International have built fully computer controlled musical fountains since 1980. These include two to six meter wide systems available to the homeowner as well as large corporate, municipal and show fountains in excess of fifty meters in length—and in the case of WET's Fountains of Bellagio, in size. These include proportional, interactive and audio spectral control that bring musical fountains to a wide audience. Fountain shapes are not limited to linear layout stage shows but include geometric and freeform shapes as well. Moreover, latest technology allows the construction of Floating watershows. Fontana Fountains first introduced the use of Stainless Steel floaters allowing bigger water show applications even in coasts and lakes.\n\nManufacturers in the Near and Far East, in places such as India and Pakistan, also produce musical fountains. Many of them have updated the look with individually servomotor-controlled nozzles, large water screens on which video can be projected, and laser effects. Shows are built not only in the standard linear form, but in circular, semicircular and oblong shapes, in multiple pools, and many other layouts. In many places in India, a musical fountain is a must-have attraction for any city, and there will often be at least one local company ready to build them. Firms also rent shows.\n\nThe fountain are through in Underground Base, this fountain are completed in June 2010, then make the fountains used for event.\n\nBuilt for the Century 21 Exposition in Seattle in 1962, the International Fountain's original design had changing water and light patterns, with a background of classical music (though the patterns weren't specifically intended to be synched with the music.) The fountain was very large, designed as a concrete bowl around a 'moonscape' of broken limestone, at the center of which was a tiled dome studded with pointy black nozzles. The fountain was not originally designed for interaction but was redesigned in 1995 by WET to make the fountain more inviting, interactive and safe. Switching out the multicolored lights for white, WET added fog nozzles, a ring of their Shooters set into the pavers around the base of the dome, and four large SuperShooters hidden in the upper surface of the dome. The restored fountains behaves as its predecessor did for most of the day, producing changing water patterns as music plays, but it now marks each hour by bringing out other effects, like fog, and performs a choreographed show.\n\nIndia's most spectacular musical fountain – the CESC Fountain of Joy – was inaugurated in Kolkata, India on 16 October 2012. \nAccording to Sanjiv Goenka, Chairman, RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group, “The CESC Fountain of Joy is a small gift from the Power Company which has been serving consumers in this area since 1899.” Goenka recalled, “During the Calcutta-300 Celebrations, Mr. R P Goenka, Chairman, CESC, decided to gift a musical fountain to the city which was inaugurated in the Maidan in 1991. He added \" The new fountain will once again be a major attraction and rejuvenate the evenings for both Kolkatans and tourists. The CESC Fountain of Joy which was inaugurated at the same site just before the Durga Pujas, is far more spectacular both in terms of technology and visual effect.”\n\nThis musical fountain is unique and has 150 channels available for water and light effects – old fountain had 20 channels for water. The concept of three-tier fountain pool, with musical fountain in the upper pool surrounded by architectural and dynamic fountains in the intermediate and lower pools, is quite unique in this subcontinent.\n\nThe CESC Fountain of Joy has a centre-fed circular water screen of 6 metre height and 18 metre width. In the upper pool, the CESC Fountain of Joy will have 99 water effects, while the intermediate pool will have 20 water effects and another 30 special water effects in the lower pool. There will be a large water cascading area – more than 80 metre long from upper pool to the intermediate pool.\n\nThe CESC Fountain of Joy comes with an enormous number of lights as also LED and PAR lamps, as also high watt reflectors, capable of constantly changing the colours to make the fountain attractive and eye-catching.\n\nAccording to CESC sources, the Fountain of Joy is integrated with ultra-fast technology, in which water effects will be controlled by the pneumatically assisted solenoid valves, capable of opening and shutting 12 times in a second, thereby resulting in water shooting in air at a spectacular speed.\n\nAccording to Mr. Sanjiv Goenka, “The inspiration for creating the new CESC Fountain of Joy in the Maidan comes from Chief Minister, Smt Mamata Banerjee, who is so keen to turn Kolkata into a beautiful megapolis.”\n\nThe estimated cost is around Rs. 3 crore.\n\nWET (Water Entertainment Technologies) also designed the Fountains of Bellagio in Las Vegas, which are set in a man-made lake long with an area of . The fountain is formed as a pair of large concentric rings and a long, curved arc, and two smaller circles are attached to the arc near each end. Shooters outline all aspects of the layout, allowing for the arc and circles to rise as columns and curtains of water, as well as providing high-speed chase sequences. Re-engineered HyperShooters fire jets nearly into the air, and more recently added ExtremeShooters are capable of reaching heights of . Needing a better way to define smoother passages of music, WET engineers developed the Oarsman nozzle, a robotic water jet that can be moved 120 degrees from side to side, to front and back, grouped with a pod of lights that follow the water stream. With the direction, water height, and light of every Oarsman controllable independently from every other Oarsman, a nearly infinite variety of patterns can be created on the lake.\n\nA fog generating device rises from beneath the water to blanket the entire lake with fog, and about 4000 individually controllable underwater lights follow the water patterns' precise movements, sparkling on the water or glowing through the fog. Performing to everything from opera to classical to Broadway to pop, the Fountains of Bellagio run every day on the half-hour, and every quarter-hour during the evening. A team of dive-certified engineers is on-site at all times, maintaining the fountain's complex mechanical, electrical and hydraulic systems.\n\nDespite the scale of such shows as the Fountains of Bellagio, these shows must still be programmed and choreographed by hand. Computers aid the process, but engineers must still spend weeks or months on each new performance before it is ready to be placed in rotation with the other shows.\n\nBranson Landing located in Branson, Missouri features a picturesque boardwalk along the Taneycomo Lakefront. The Landing's center attraction is the Town Square, which is home to a $7.5 million choreographed water attraction designed by WET. The fountains at Branson Landing include dancing and blasting water shooters, blasting water up to in the air, fire, light and music.\n\nOne other notable fountain of the choreographed type is the Grand Haven Musical Fountain in Grand Haven, Michigan. Built in 1962 by volunteers and designed by a local engineer, this fountain was based on a Przystawic show seen in Germany and was the largest musical fountain in the world when it was built. The display comprises a small number of water formations grouped in odd and even segments, with the same formations on each. Augmented by curtains of water at the back and front, a large fanlike array called the Peacock, and three fire hose nozzles - one placed vertically in the center, and the others aimed at an angle from each end - the show produces a simple Dancing Waters style display. Colored lights are arrayed along the front of the fountain in individually controllable groups in red, blue, amber and white, and the back curtain and Peacock sprays have their own lights - green and yellow for the back curtain, and two sets each red, blue and amber for the Peacock. In addition, nozzles called \"sweeps\" provide the moving effects, swaying side-to-side.\n\nA patented drive mechanism allows each pair of sweeps to follow or oppose each other in direction of movement, to move along long or short paths, and to move at any of three speeds, allowing the moving water to follow nearly any kind of music. The original show used punched paper cards, though computers control the new system. The nozzles and pumps have never been changed, only cleaned and cared-for; and shows must still be programmed by hand. Even with the simplest of the many programs used to create shows for this fountain, choreographing one three-minute song can take anywhere from two to four hours. The Grand Haven Musical Fountain still performs nightly, and is viewable from a grandstand on the waterfront in Grand Haven.\n\nMultimedia Fountain Kangwon Land was opened in August 2007. It is considered Asia's largest musical fountain. Multimedia system consists of 180 m water fountains, water screen, video, light, 12 multi-coloured fire units, and laser. The Magical Box multimedia show consists of the big cube system and the fountain. In combination with the fountain during daylight hours the box appears mirrored, but at night it is illuminated to reveal its interior. At night a globe can be seen, some 20 meters in diameter. The special lighting effects give the impression that the globe is rotating and displays the five continents of the world.\n\nInside the globe is the \"Dome Cinema\". The \"Dome Cinema\" has a diameter of 18 meters and is used as the projection area. Video images from TV, DVD, or VHS sources are projected directly into the dome. These images fill almost two thirds of the space. As a result of the various depths of the room, a new laser video system is used to ensure that the images are not distorted. Outside the \"Miracle World Box\" is the largest fully automatic screen (24 m x 24 m) in the world! Lighting effects, laser projections and synchronized choreographies ensure a unique and unforgettable experience. All of the technology used in and around the \"Miracle World Box\" was designed, developed and installed by Emotion Media Factory.\n\nThe largest musical fountain project in the world is the Dubai Fountain. It spans on a 30-acre manmade Burj Khalifa Lake. It was designed by WET Design, the California-based company responsible for the fountains at the Bellagio Hotel Lake in Las Vegas. It includes 6,600 lights, 25 colored projectors, fog, and fire. It is 275 m (902 ft) long and shoots water 150 m (490 ft) into the air (equivalent to a 50-story building), accompanied by a range of classical to contemporary Arabic and world music. It was built at a cost of 218 million Dollars. The fountain was formally opened by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum on May 8, 2009, along with the Dubai Mall. Situated in front of the Burj Khalifa, it is best viewed by the public from the Souk al Bahar or the Dubai Mall.\n\nWorld of Color is a new nighttime show at Disney California Adventure Park, part of the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California. The entire show cost US$75,000,000 to design, manufacture and build. The process of assembling, installing, and testing the show's numerous components and equipment in Paradise Bay spanned a period of approximately 15 months. It premiered on Friday June 11, 2010 as part of \"Summer Nightastic!\". Conceived by VP Parades and Spectaculars, Steve Davison and designed by Walt Disney Creative Entertainment, the show has more than 1,200 fountains and includes lights, water, fire, fog, and lasers, with high-definition projections on mist screens.\n\nDisney Dreams! is the new show at Disneyland Paris, based on Peter Pan's shadow story. It includes HD projections onto the castle, with pyrotechnics, synchronized fireworks ; water screens and fountains were provided by the French company Aquatique Show.\nThe project took 18 months to be entirely built, including tests and changes, and cost €10,000,000 (~$13,000,000). It has been a daily show since April 2012, and modifications were added for the first anniversary: two new scenes from The Lion King and Brave. From November 10, 2013 to January 6, 2014 a new show remplaces it: Disney Dreams! of Christmas.\n\nLocated indoors in Nashville, Tennessee under a glass dome at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center, this musical fountain features an 85-foot high center geyser surrounded by 68 vertical and 28 arching jets, each with its own RGB LED fixture, plus a fog system and 5 articulating color theatrical lights from above. The sophisticated system was designed by water feature specialists Aquatic Creations, Inc., and plays original music shows choreographed by H2Oarts.com, both of California. The Delta fountain is on a deck rather than in a basin, so it is possible to experience close enough to get lightly misted.\n\nThe Blackpool fountains, created by French company Aquatique Show, are located at a well known theme park Blackpool Pleasure beach UK. The fountains dance every 30 minutes to a wide range of music. They opened in 2009 letting people run through them. In 2010 they stopped peopled going in them due to health and safety so now they have security guards when the show is on round the fountain. The fountain has 25 jets which can shoot up to 100 ft.\n\nMultimedia fountain Roshen is located in Vinnytsia, a city in west-central Ukraine, located on the banks of the Southern Buh. Built in 2011 it is considered as one of the largest floating fountains in Europe. It is the major multimedia attraction in the city.\n\nThe multimedia shows are combining water effects (fountain), music, lasers and 3D projection on the water screen. For the fountain shows the super powerful LED lights are used allowing applying very bright and showy backlighting resulting in various picturesque effects. Despite other fountains in Ukraine, Roshen multimedia fountain has moving particles reaching verticity due to which the water spring angle is changing dynamically. The sound power of the audio system is 3840 Watt. The height of the central spring reaches 65–70 metres, the projection screen dimension is around 16 metres height and 45 metres width, and the frontal water dispersion constitutes 140 metres. The project design and development was performed by Emotion Media Factory.\n\nOpened in May 2012, Aquanura boasts being the largest water fountain show in Europa and the third largest in the world. It was built on a lagoon near the main entrance of the Efteling, one of Europe's oldest and largest theme parks. Aquanura means \"water frogs\" and tells the story of The Frog Prince by the Brothers Grimm in a spectacle of water, music, lights and fire. The water fountain was designed and built by WET and features over 200 brightly colored fountains that come to live in a 12-minute-show each day. The show premiered for the 60th anniversary of the theme park and can be seen daily. It is included in the entrance price to the Efteling, however during the summer, separate tickets are sold just to be able to see Aquanura.\n\nBefore Aquanura opened, the Efteling had an indoor musical fountain ('waterorgan'). It used to be hand-operated, with pedals and levers, but was later automated. When it opened in 1966, it had live music, but as of 1979, a recording was used. The waterorgan was put out of operation in August 2010, its venue being reused as a studio for a children's television program. It is not clear whether the installation has only been covered up temporarily, or if it has been permanently removed.\n\nWhile all pre-programmed musical fountain shows involve computerized show control systems, the use of computer technology to spontaneously \"self-choreograph\" a fountain to random musical input is novel. Possibly the most sophisticated full-scale implementations in use are at the Miracle Mile Shops in Las Vegas, Washington Park (Cincinnati, Ohio), and Washington Harbour in the District of Columbia, using a system developed by H2Oarts.com. Unlike conventional musical fountains, which must be manually pre-programmed moment-to-moment, the H2Oarts' Musical Water Feature Automation System uses the venue's own live background music to animate the water and lights in real time. Beyond basic light organ-style responses to loudness, bass, and treble, H2Oarts employs rhythm, dynamic range, transient (acoustics), and other subtler components of music to control water and light.\n\n"}

During Congress Hall's duration as the capitol of the United States, the country admitted three new states, Vermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee; ratified the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution; and oversaw the Presidential inaugurations of both George Washington (his second) and John Adams.\n\nCongress Hall was restored in the 20th century to its original appearance in 1796. The building is now managed by the National Park Service within the Independence National Historical Park and is open for public tours. Congress Hall is conjoined with Independence Hall, which is adjacent to the east.\n\nPhiladelphia served as the capital of the United States both during and immediately after the American Revolutionary War. Independence Hall, located next door, served as the meeting place of the Continental Congress until the Pennsylvania Mutiny in June 1783. The failure of the Pennsylvania government to protect Congress from a mob of angry mutineers caused the representatives to withdraw to Princeton, New Jersey. The national capital then moved to Annapolis, Maryland in November 1783, then to Trenton, New Jersey in November 1784 before finally moving to New York City in January 1785. State delegates did not return to Independence Hall in Philadelphia until the United States Constitutional Convention in 1787; however, remained the official capital even during the convention. Designed by architect Samuel Lewis, Congress Hall was originally built to serve as the Philadelphia County Courthouse; construction began in 1787 and was completed two years later.\n\nArticle One, Section Eight, of the United States Constitution granted Congress the authority to create a federal district to serve as the national capital. Following the ratification of the Constitution, the Congress, while meeting in New York, passed the Residence Act on July 9, 1790. The Act established the District of Columbia on the banks of the Potomac River between the states of Maryland and Virginia to serve as the new federal capital. However, Robert Morris, a Senator from Pennsylvania, convinced Congress to return to Philadelphia while the new permanent capital was being built. As a result, the Residence Act also declared Philadelphia to be the temporary capital for a period of ten years.\n\nIn an attempt to convince Congress to keep the capital in Philadelphia, the city began construction on a massive new Presidential palace on 9th Street as well as an expansion to the County Courthouse into what would become Congress Hall. Upon the return of Congress to Philadelphia on December 6, 1790, the first level of Congress Hall had been transformed into the chamber for the House of Representatives and the second floor had been converted into a chamber for the United States Senate. Despite their efforts to construct new buildings for use by the federal government, the city's residents failed to convince Congress to modify the Residence Act and make Philadelphia the permanent capital. Congress Hall served as the capitol building until May 14, 1800, when the offices of the national government moved to Washington, D.C.\n\nThe House chamber on the first floor is rather simple and featured mahogany desks and leather chairs. The room eventually accommodated 106 representatives from 16 states: the 13 original states as well as the representatives from the new states of Vermont in 1791, Kentucky in 1792, and Tennessee in 1796. The room has been restored to its original appearance in 1796.\n\nThe second floor, reserved as the chamber for the Senate, was more ornate and adorned with heavy red drapes. By 1796, the room featured 32 secretary desks very similar to the desks that are still used in the current Senate chamber in the United States Capitol; 28 of the desks at Congress Hall are original. Portraits of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, presented as gifts from the French monarch following the American Revolution, hang in adjoining committee rooms. A fresco of an American bald eagle is painted on the ceiling, holding the traditional olive branch to symbolize peace. Also on the ceiling, a plaster medallion in the form of a sunburst features 13 stars to represent the original colonies. The design mirrors a similar pattern on the floor, where a carpet made by William Sprague, a local weaver, features the shields of each of the 13 original states. The carpet seen today is a reproduction of the original.\n\nDuring the almost ten years it served as the capitol, Congress Hall witnessed many historic events including the admittance of three new states. The United States Bill of Rights was ratified at Congress Hall in 1791. The second inauguration of George Washington took place in the House chamber in 1793, as did the inauguration of John Adams in 1797. Congress also used the time to establish the First Bank of the United States, the Federal Mint, and the United States Department of the Navy. The Jay Treaty, which secured a temporary peace with Great Britain, was also ratified at Congress Hall in 1796. After the capital moved to Washington, Congress Hall returned to its original function as the Philadelphia County Courthouse and served as the location of both state and federal courts during the early 19th century. Also designed by Samuel Lewis, the Burlington County Courthouse in Mount Holly Township, New Jersey was built in 1796 and modeled after Congress Hall.\n\nAfter its use as a courthouse in the early 19th century, Congress Hall, like other buildings in the area, had fallen into disrepair. In 1870, the Pennsylvania General Assembly ordered the demolition of all the buildings surrounding Independence Hall. However, the law was never enforced and was officially repealed in 1895. Under the leadership of a civic organization known as The Colonial Dames of America, the architect George Champlin Mason, Jr. began restoring Congress Hall in 1895-96, though this work was mostly limited to the Senate chamber. In 1900, the Philadelphia chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) began a study of Congress Hall and initiated a funding drive for the building's complete restoration. After funds were secured, the City of Philadelphia approved the restoration project in 1912 under the supervision of the AIA. Work on Congress Hall was completed the following year when President Woodrow Wilson rededicated the building. Additional work to refurbish the House chamber was completed in 1934. In 1942, over 50 civic and patriotic groups met at the American Philosophical Society and joined to create the Independence Hall Association. The association lobbied for the creation of Independence National Historical Park, which was initially approved by Congress in 1948 and formally established on July 4, 1956.\n\nCongress Hall is now maintained by the National Park Service, which operates guided tours of the building throughout the year on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nOn December 2, 2008, the building hosted President-elect Barack Obama's meeting with the National Governors Association where they discussed the economic crisis then facing the country.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2025687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2025687", "title": "Ex rel.", "text": "Ex rel.\n\nEx rel. is an abbreviation of the Latin phrase \"\"ex relatione\" (meaning \"[arising] out of the relation/narration [of the relator]\" ). The term is a legal phrase; the legal citation guide, the \"Bluebook\", describes \"ex rel.\" as a \"procedural phrase\" and requires using it to abbreviate \"on the relation of\", \"for the use of\", \"on behalf of\", and similar expressions.\n\nIt is most commonly used when a government brings a cause of action upon the request of a private party who has some interest in the matter. The private party is called the \"relator\" in such a case. The government acts on the basis of the narration or recounting (Latin \"relatione\") of the alleged facts by the relator. Governments typically accept applications and commence litigation for \"ex rel.\" actions only if the interest advanced by the private party is similar to the interest of the government.\n\nNew York has a \"forever wild\" constitutional article, which is enforceable by action of the New York State Attorney General or by any citizen \"ex rel.\" with the consent of the Appellate Division.\n\nThe term can also be used when a relative or party in privity brings suit on another person's behalf. For example, the Terri Schiavo appeal to the United States Supreme Court was titled \"Schiavo ex rel. Schindler v. Schiavo\".\n"}

It is a difficult game which depends mostly on luck and is sometimes mechanical. It is also one of the many games where there are no clear rules but with two versions. The one described below is laid out by Peter Arnold in his book \"Card Games for One\" ().\n\nOne Q and one J are taken out of the deck to form the foundations. As they become available during the deal, the two J and the four black 10s (two 10♠ and two 10♣) are placed beside the two cards already present also form the foundations. After that, sixteen cards are dealt into two rows of eight cards each, forming the bases for the sixteen tableau piles. The foundations and the tableau may look like this:\n\nThe Q is built up to Jack, and all other foundations are built down, with the Jacks up to Queens and the Tens up to Jacks, all by suit and all round-the-corner, i.e. putting a king over an ace and vice versa. The cards to be used to build on these eight foundations are those put on the piles. The top card of each pile is available for play.\n\nOnce no more moves are possible, a new batch of 16 cards are dealt from the stock, one on each pile, filling any gaps in the process. Therefore, an empty pile is not filled until the next deal. In between deals, cards are moved onto the foundations. The dealing of new batches of cards and moving cards to the foundations continue until the stock runs out. From that point, a new special process of dealing begins.\n\nUsing the diagram above as a guideline, the player picks up the cards from pile 16 and deals them from left to right, starting from the gap it leaves behind and goes from pile 16 to pile 1 if necessary. Then the cards from pile 15 are picked up and deal a card to piles 15, 16, 1, and so on until they run out. Then the cards on pile 14 are done the same. This continues until all cards from pile 1 are dealt. The player must make a point to build appropriate cards to the foundations each time after a pile is dealt. Also, a pile with only one card is left untouched because once it is picked up, it is placed back there anyway.\n\nThe game is won when all cards are built into the foundations.\n\nFurthermore, while the words \"matrimony\" and \"marriage\" are synonymous with each other, this game should not be confused with another solitaire game Royal Marriage.\n"}

He previously played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the New York Islanders, Edmonton Oilers and Colorado Avalanche, and previously served as head coach of IK Oskarshamn.\n\nSalo began his career playing three seasons in the Elitserien with Västerås IK. He was chosen 118th overall, in the fifth round, by the New York Islanders in 1993. He debuted with the Islanders in 1994–95, but would play the majority of his first two seasons in North America with New York's International Hockey League (IHL) affiliate, the Utah Grizzlies. Playing in the IHL, Salo won back-to-back Turner Cups with the Grizzlies as league champions and earned the N.R. \"Bud\" Poile Trophy as playoff MVP in 1996. In his first year, he was named both league MVP and rookie of the year in 1995, in addition to First Team All-Star honours and a James Norris Memorial Trophy for allowing the fewest goals against.\n\nIn 1996–97, Salo emerged as the Islanders' starting goaltender and played in that capacity for the club until March 20, 1999, when he was traded to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Mats Lindgren and an eighth-round pick in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft (used to select Radek Martínek). Salo found his stride in Edmonton and was chosen to two All-Star Games in 2000 and 2002. In 2001–02, Salo recorded a career-best 2.22 goals against average (GAA).\n\nOn March 9, 2004, after six seasons with Edmonton, Salo was traded to the Colorado Avalanche (along with a sixth-round pick in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft) in exchange for Tom Gilbert. As NHL play was suspended the following season due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Salo returned to Sweden in signing a one-year contract with Modo Hockey of the Elitserien.\n\nAfter Modo was eliminated in the playoffs by Färjestad BK, Salo announced his retirement from professional hockey on March 17, 2005, citing chronic hip pain. However, on August 4, he returned to the Elitserien to sign with Frölunda HC. This led to a conflict with Modo since they had agreed to terminate his contract on account of his retirement. In light of this, the club appealed for Frölunda to pay Salo's salary. On August 11, the issue was settled after Modo withdrew their claim. By signing with Frölunda, Salo replaced the departing Henrik Lundqvist, who incidentally, had taken over Salo's starting position on the Swedish national team.\n\nOn December 9, 2006, in an interview with Swedish newspaper \"Expressen\", Salo announced that he would retire from playing professional hockey after the 2006–07 season.\n\nSalo first competed for Sweden in the 1991 World Junior Championships. He played in six games and posted a 3.32 GAA.\n\nSeveral years later, he played an integral role in Sweden's gold medal victory at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. Salo made critical saves in the gold medal game, as they defeated Canada in a shootout to secure Sweden's first Olympic gold medal in ice hockey.\n\nIn 1998, Salo once again competed in the Winter Olympics, as NHL players were allowed to compete for the first time. He played in four games as Sweden failed to medal.\n\nAt the 2002 Winter Olympics, Salo started for Sweden once more and were favourites to win the gold medal, placing first in the round robin. However, in the quarter-final game against Belarus, with the game tied late in the third period, Salo surrendered a 20-metre goal from defenceman Vladimir Kopat. The long slap shot puck bounced off Salo's mask after he had hopped, went up in the air, and bounced off of his back and into the net. Sweden would not recover and Salo was made the scapegoat in one of the biggest upsets in international hockey history. Sweden captain Mats Sundin berated fans and media for singling-out Salo, saying that \"the entire team played subpar, a single fluke goal shouldn't cost us the game\". Some would claim that Salo was never the same after the incident.\n\nShortly after completing his playing career, on March 5, 2007, Kungälvs IK of the Swedish tier III league announced that Salo would be their head coach for the next two seasons. Following his tenure with the club, he signed with IK Oskarshamn on March 12, 2009.\n\nOn December 1, 2010, Salo left his post at IK Oskarshamn to become general manager of Leksands IF.\n\nInternational\nIHL\nNHL\nElitserien\n\n"}

{"id": "2025715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2025715", "title": "Don't Forget Your Toothbrush", "text": "Don't Forget Your Toothbrush\n\nDon't Forget Your Toothbrush is a British light entertainment TV programme that aired on Channel 4 from 12 February 1994 to 25 February 1995 and is hosted by Chris Evans.\n\n\"Don't Forget Your Toothbrush\" was written and presented by Chris Evans in his first major venture away from \"The Big Breakfast\". The first pilot was considered unsuccessful by executives and Evans himself. Channel 4 chief executive Michael Grade said that the pilot was \"like amateur's hour\". Feeling pressured, Evans ordered the studio audience to laugh at his jokes, threatening to humiliate any dissenters on stage. After two failed pilots, the broadcaster was reluctant to waste the money that they had spent developing the show. At some point in the process, executive producer Sebastian Scott left the project and Evans invited experienced game show producer William G. Stewart to develop the show. The show ran for two series in 1994 and 1995 on Channel 4. Shows were transmitted live on Saturday nights the first series at 10pm, the second at 9pm. Each episode would be repeated at teatime on the following Monday (series 1) or Sunday (series 2).\n\nThe theme music was composed by David Arnold, though Jools Holland (with his Big Band in series one, and Rhythm and Blues Orchestra in series two) provided the music during the live shows. They accompanied the star performers, who included Cher, Barry White, Lulu and Tony Hadley. Evans ended each show with a song. In series one, he sang Morecambe and Wise's \"Bring Me Sunshine\" with that week's star guest, while in series two he sang Andy Williams' \"It's So Easy\".\n\nThe star guest took part in the Superfan quiz to see if they knew more trivia about themselves than a huge fan, against whom they were competing. The prize was a possession of the stars that only a true fan would value. During the quiz round, usually between questions, Chris Evans would ask for the clock to be stopped, and then have a brief conversation with the celebrity guest regarding the question just asked, before starting it up again for the next one.\n\n\"Don't Forget Your Toothbrush\" was also a game show. Each member of the audience was obliged to bring a passport and a packed suitcase to the studio, and to arrange to take the following week off work (unless they were unemployed or, as was pointed out, did not care if they lost their jobs). Two members of the audience were selected to take part in the \"Light Your Lemon\" quiz as a team, and a postcard was drawn from those sent in by home viewers. The studio contestants were asked a maximum of nine questions, with right and wrong answers lighting a section of a giant cocktail glass or ice cream cone, respectively. If the studio contestants gave five correct answers, they would \"light the lemon\" on the glass. However, if they missed five, they would \"flash the Flake\" on the cone and Evans then called the home viewer and asked him/her one question. The studio contestants won a holiday to an exotic destination either by lighting the lemon, or by default if they flashed the Flake and the home viewer either missed his/her question or failed to answer Evans' call within five rings. If the home viewer did answer correctly, he/she won the exotic holiday and the studio contestants received one to a much less appealing destination. The two places were chosen for their alliterative names, such as Martinique versus Margate, and the studio contestants departed immediately after the show for whichever holiday they had won. Evans would introduce this segment by looking between alternate cameras in time to a drum beat that parodied the scene changes from one of his favourite TV shows, \"Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons\".\n\nThe hostess for the first series was Evans' then-girlfriend Rachel-Tatton Brown, who had previously worked on \"The Big Breakfast\". Despite being a former model, Tatton-Brown was uncomfortable in front of the cameras and aspired to move onto something else. She was replaced in the second series by his then-new girlfriend, Jadene Doran, whom he frequently introduced as \"Ms Let-Your-Hair-Down\" and who let her hair fall loose as she arrived onstage, by releasing it from its tied-up style or removing a hat.\n\nOne game featured during the second series involved home viewers following Evans' instructions to flash their house lights on and off at a particular moment. A camera crew in a mystery location would search for someone taking part. When a house had been found, the occupants (who were never identified by name on camera) had two minutes to throw 10 named items out of specific windows (e.g. \"Throw a sofa cushion out of the downstairs window\"). They received £1,000 for winning the game, thrown to them by the camera crew.\n\nIn the penultimate episode of the first series, Evans constantly touted a huge surprise throughout the show, but did not reveal it until \"Light Your Lemon\" was about to begin. He announced that if the studio contestants won the exotic holiday, then every member of the audience would go for a week's holiday at Disneyland Paris. They won, and the whole audience left for Disneyland Paris immediately after the show.\n\nDuring the second series, it was announced that there would be no third series, in order to allow the show to go out on a high. Evans soon signed up to host the Radio 1 Breakfast Show, and returned to Channel 4 with TFI Friday.\n"}

For SAMS the ranks had a maroon background.\n\nNote: in the artillery and anti-aircraft corps, the corporal and lance-corporal are called \"bombardier\" and \"lance-bombardier\". The private is called a \"gunner\" in the artillery and anti-aircraft, a \"rifleman\" in the infantry, a \"trooper\" in the armoured corps, a \"sapper\" in the engineers, a \"signalman\" in the signals corps, and a \"scout\" in the intelligence corps.\n\nAny warrant officer class 1 could be posted to substantive posts, including\n\nHowever they would retain the rank of WO1, while wearing unique rank insignia. To distinguish the posting different colour backgrounds were used; for example, red for regimental sergeant major and black for command sergeant major.

It was given its present name in 1951. The rank system is derived from that of the British Army.\nThe ranks of General Officers changed in September 2003 when the rank previously called Brigadier became known as Brigadier General.\n\nThe SA Air Force was formed in 1920. Unlike many other Commonwealth air forces, it had army style rank system. In 2002 the Air Force officer rank insignia structure was changed from one which was shared with the Army to a new pattern based on stripes. The Air Force stated that this was \"in order to bring it more in line with international forms of rank\". The army-style rank titles were retained. Note: The Rank of General is only used when the Chief of the Air Force is also the Chief of the Defence Force which has occurred on occasion in the past. \n\nThe SA Navy was originally two separate organisations, namely the South African Division of the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve (formed in 1913) and the South African Naval Service (formed in 1922 and renamed the \"Seaward Defence Force\" in 1939).

Wyman, John Bartlett, Phil Weiand Jr, Al Segal, Dean Moon, and Vic Edelbrock Jr. and now consists of 6,383 companies worldwide, bringing together aftermarket manufacturers, original equipment manufacturers (OEM), media, car dealers, specialty equipment distributors, installers, retailers and restoration specialists.\n\nSEMA provides services for employees of its member companies that include education and professional development, market research, legislative and regulatory advocacy, industry publications, international business development and business-to-business events.\n\nThe largest of the SEMA events held annually during the first week of November is the \"SEMA Show\" at the Las Vegas Convention Center in Las Vegas, Nevada in conjunction with the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Week. As part of this event, SEMA and other automotive aftermarket trade groups make-up one of the single largest events on the Las Vegas calendar. This auto show is not open to the public. Registration as media, manufacturer, buyer or exhibitor is required.\n\nThe SEMA acronym originally stood for Speed Equipment Manufacturing Association. In 1970, government regulations became an issue and the name was changed to \"Specialty\" Equipment \"Market\" Association to improve the overall image of the association. It was also warned that bureaucrats in the industry may be turned off by the word \"speed\", which Corporate Council Earl Kitner felt they may associate with \"the swinging generation.\" SEMA came about as a result of the company Revell Models attempting to fill a gap in industry trade regulation. Its first president was Ed Iskenderian. Other original members of the organization include Roy Richter, Willie Garner, Bob Hedman, Robert E. Wyman, John Bartlett, Phil Weiand Jr., Al Segal, Dean Moon, and Vic Edelbrock Jr. \n\nFounding members of SEMA\nThe SEMA Show is held at the Las Vegas Convention Center. It is among the largest conventions held in Vegas. The 2013 SEMA Show drew about 60,000 buyers. The displays are segmented into 12 sections, and a New Products Showcase features nearly 2,000 newly introduced parts, tools and components. In addition, the SEMA Show provides attendees with educational seminars, product demonstrations, special events, networking opportunities and more.\n\nThe first SEMA Show was held in 1967 in the basement of the Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, before moving to the new Anaheim Stadium in 1974. In 1967 they had 98 manufacturers manning booths and an attendance of 3,000 people. In 1967 there were 5 cars on display, including a 1967 Ford GT40 in the Shelby America booth and a drag-race-prepped Dodge Dart. The early shows, held in Los Angeles and Anaheim, California, were exclusively card-table-and-masking-tape affairs, but by the early 1970s, sophisticated display and marketing techniques were visible throughout the show. At that time, a Show booth cost $375. The Show moved to a different location—the new and expansive Anaheim Convention Center (across from Disneyland). Booth sales and attendance kept increasing dramatically. The SEMA Show continued to cater to the needs of industry representatives rather than consumers and began to develop a reputation as a place where business was expected and completed. As part of the ’70s SEMA Shows, one of the must-attend events was Doris Herbert’s Drag News party, which was topped only by the SEMA Awards Banquet.\n\nIn 1975, the featured entertainers for the Awards Banquet were April Stevens and Nino Tempo. In 1976 (the last SEMA Show to be held in Anaheim), the show was a sellout with 570 booths and, in fact, had to turn away a number of manufacturers due to lack of space. Over the next few years, the Show grew much larger and soon filled the Convention Center to capacity and was moved to Las Vegas in 1977. Las Vegas was chosen because it provided room for continued growth, dependable weather, big-name entertainment and a world-famous location.\n\nIn 1977, SEMA’s Awards Banquet (run by Sheldon Konblett) was held at the Sands Hotel and featured Norm Crosby. Sheldon Konblett also developed the design for the SEMA trophies, which have come to symbolize product innovation and excellence in the industry.\n\nIn 1979, Nile Cornelison began plans for his Innovations Day seminars program, which has since become one of the major annual association programs. The following year, Innovations Day was a smashing success and featured Lee Iacocca as the keynote speaker. Never before had any activity held on the day prior to the Show’s opening attracted anything near the more than 460 who attended. That same year, Willie Nelson was the featured entertainer for the SEMA Awards Banquet.\n\nIn 1983, the import parts section of the SEMA Show was added under the auspices of sister organization, Automotive International Association, thus changing the name to SEMA/AI Show. In 1984, there was a combined SEMA/AI/APAA Show in Las Vegas. The Industry Awards Banquet was held at the MGM Grand, and the entertainment was provided by The Platters and Gallagher. By all indications, the move to Las Vegas has been an overwhelming success. In 1986, \"Car and Driver\" magazine noted that the Show was a “...prime opportunity to monitor the West Coast car culture without breathing the smog or fighting the freeways.” That same year, Jay Leno made his first appearance on stage at the SEMA Show Industry Awards Banquet.\n\nIn 1990, the onsite registration fee was increased to $20. All exhibitors are eligible to submit an entry into the New Products Showcase at no cost. In 1992, the SEMA/AI Show and the Automotive Service Industry, Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association and Automotive Parts & Accessories Association (ASIA/MEMA/APAA Show—formerly the Big I/APAA Show) came together to form Automotive Aftermarket Industry Week (AAIW) in Las Vegas. The two shows together boasted in excess of 1.6 million square feet of exhibits.\n\nIn 1997, the National Tire Dealers & Retreaders (NTDRA) trade show was combined with the SEMA Show. Affiliating the 77-year-old NTDRA trade show with the SEMA portion of AAIW provided benefits to both sides. In the same year, Goodyear sponsored the first SEMA-NTDRA “Racers’ Night Out” at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway.\n\nIn 1998, the SEMA Show broke the 500,000-foot mark with 502,912 net square feet of rented space. Each year since then, the Show has set new records of some sort. It now occupies more than one million net square feet, draws more than 3,000 media, and has a buyer attendance in excess of 60,000. The SEMA Show now routinely brings together more than 2,300 exhibitors, occupying in excess of 11,000 booths. Total attendance at the Show now tops 150,000 manufacturers, buyers and other industry representatives, making contacts and doing business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcept on 4x4 by SG Concepts\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2003, the GT awards have been presented at the SEMA Auto Convention, and these include categories such as \"Best in Show\", \"Best Hot Rod\", and \"Best European Import\". SEMA was also presented with the \"Grassroots Motorsports\" Editors' Choice Award in 2012.\n\nSince 1997, the SEMA Action Network (SAN) has been a grassroots network for the automotive hobby. The SEMA Action Network is a partnership between enthusiasts, vehicle clubs and members of the specialty automotive parts industry in the United States and Canada who have collaborated to promote automotive hobby-friendly legislation and laws.\n\nIn the past, the SAN has:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2025734", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2025734", "title": "Entropic force", "text": "Entropic force\n\nIn physics, an entropic force acting in a system is an emergent phenomenon resulting from the entire system's statistical tendency to increase its entropy, rather than from a particular underlying force on the atomic scale.\nThe entropic force can be considered as an emergent of the entropic interaction. The concept of entropic interaction was usually used in a subjunctive mood. For example: \"macromolecule links, as if, entropically repulse from each other at a short distance and entropically are attracted to each other at a long distance”. In a modern view the entropic interaction is considered to be a real-life interaction, and it is viewed as a mutual influence of open thermodynamic systems on each other by means of transferring information about their states, changing their entropies and translation of these systems into more probable conditions. The entropic interaction is a quintessential physical interaction that is realized by well-known basic interactions (gravitational, electromagnetic, nuclear strong and weak) through the processes that occur elsewhere in the universe including the solar system, our planet Earth, and living organisms. The basic interactions are considered to be daughter of the entropic interaction. The entropic interaction is not a consequence of existence of some entropy charge and a field accompanying it. It should not be referred to as a distribution of the entropy in the space. Entropy interaction reflects only an “order” and “structure” of the space, the state of the space and physical systems in it and, ultimately, affects the energy, behavior and evolution of such systems as well as the space as a whole. The entropic interaction results in the alteration of symmetry, free energy, and other characteristics of the physical system. Using this interaction, all material objects in Nature exert a certain influence on each other, regardless of the distance between them.\n\nIn the canonical ensemble, the entropic force formula_1 associated to a macrostate partition formula_2 is given by:\nformula_3\nwhere formula_4 is the temperature, formula_5 is the entropy associated to the macrostate formula_6 and formula_7 is the present macrostate.\n\nAccording to Mach's principle, local physics laws are determined by a large-scale structure of the universe and changes in any part of the universe affect a corresponding impact on all of its parts First of all, such changes are due by the entropic interaction. Once they have a place in one part of the universe, the entropy of the universe as a whole changes as well. That is, the entire universe “feels” such changes at the same time. In other words, the entropic interaction between different parts of any thermodynamic system happens instantly without the transfer of any material substance, meaning it is always a long-range action. After that, some processes emerge inside the system to transfer some substances or portions of energy in the appropriate direction. These actions are produced by one (or few) of basic interactions according to the mode of short-range action.\n\nHeat dispersion is one of the examples of the entropic interaction. When one side of a metal pole is heated, a non-homogeneous temperature distribution is created along the pole. Because of entropic interaction between different parts of the pole, the entropy of the entire pole will decrease instantly. At the same time, the tendency appears to obtain a homogeneous distribution of the temperature (and by that to increase the entropy of the pole). This would be a long-range action. The process of heat conductivity will emerge to realize this tendency by a short-range action. Overall, this is an example of co-existence of the long and short-range actions in one process.\n\nThe internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature, and not on the volume of its containing box, so it is not an energy effect that tends to increase the volume of the box as gas pressure does. This implies that the pressure of an ideal gas has an entropic origin.\n\nWhat is the origin of such an entropic force? The most general answer is that the effect of thermal fluctuations tends to bring a thermodynamic system toward a macroscopic state that corresponds to a maximum in the number of microscopic states (or micro-states) that are compatible with this macroscopic state. In other words, thermal fluctuations tend to bring a system toward its macroscopic state of maximum entropy.\n\nThe entropic approach to Brownian movement was initially proposed by R. M. Neumann. Neumann derived the entropic force for a particle undergoing three-dimensional Brownian motion using the Boltzmann equation, denoting this force as a \"diffusional driving force\" or \"radial force\". In the paper, three example systems are shown to exhibit such a force:\n\nA standard example of an entropic force is the elasticity of a freely-jointed polymer molecule. For an ideal chain, maximizing its entropy means reducing the distance between its two free ends. Consequently, a force that tends to collapse the chain is exerted by the ideal chain between its two free ends. This entropic force is proportional to the distance between the two ends. The entropic force by a freely-jointed chain has a clear mechanical origin, and can be computed using constrained Lagrangian dynamics.\n\nAnother example of an entropic force is the hydrophobic force. At room temperature, it partly originates from the loss of entropy by the 3D network of water molecules when they interact with molecules of dissolved substance. Each water molecule is capable of\nTherefore, water molecules can form an extended three-dimensional network. Introduction of a non-hydrogen-bonding surface disrupts this network. The water molecules rearrange themselves around the surface, so as to minimize the number of disrupted hydrogen bonds. This is in contrast to hydrogen fluoride (which can accept 3 but donate only 1) or ammonia (which can donate 3 but accept only 1), which mainly form linear chains.\n\nIf the introduced surface had an ionic or polar nature, there would be water molecules standing upright on 1 (along the axis of an orbital for ionic bond) or 2 (along a resultant polarity axis) of the four sp orbitals. These orientations allow easy movement, i.e. degrees of freedom, and thus lowers entropy minimally. But a non-hydrogen-bonding surface with a moderate curvature forces the water molecule to sit tight on the surface, spreading 3 hydrogen bonds tangential to the surface, which then become locked in a clathrate-like basket shape. Water molecules involved in this clathrate-like basket around the non-hydrogen-bonding surface are constrained in their orientation. Thus, any event that would minimize such a surface is entropically favored. For example, when two such hydrophobic particles come very close, the clathrate-like baskets surrounding them merge. This releases some of the water molecules into the bulk of the water, leading to an increase in entropy.\n\nAnother related and counter-intuitive example of entropic force is protein folding, which is a spontaneous process and where hydrophobic effect also plays a role. Structures of water-soluble proteins typically have a core in which hydrophobic side chains are buried from water, which stabilizes the folded state. Charged and polar side chains are situated on the solvent-exposed surface where they interact with surrounding water molecules. Minimizing the number of hydrophobic side chains exposed to water is the principal driving force behind the folding process,\n\nEntropic forces are important and widespread in the physics of colloids, where they are responsible for the depletion force, and the ordering of hard particles, such as the crystallization of hard spheres, the isotropic-nematic transition in liquid crystal phases of hard rods, and the ordering of hard polyhedra. Because of this, entropic forces can be an important driver of self-assembly\n\nEntropic forces arise in colloidal systems due to the osmotic pressure that comes from particle crowding. This was first discovered in, and is most intuitive for, colloid-polymer mixtures described by the Asakura–Oosawa model. In this model, polymers are approximated as finite-sized spheres that can penetrate one another, but cannot penetrate the colloidal particles. The inability of the polymers to penetrate the colloids leads to a region around the colloids in which the polymer density is reduced. If the regions of reduced polymer density around two colloids overlap with one another, by means of the colloids approaching one another, the polymers in the system gain an additional free volume that is equal to the volume of the intersection of the reduced density regions. The additional free volume causes an increase in the entropy of the polymers, and drives them to form locally dense-packed aggregates. A similar effect occurs in sufficiently dense colloidal systems without polymers, where osmotic pressure also drives the local dense packing of colloids into a diverse array of structures that can be rationally designed by modifying the shape of the particles. These effects are for anisotropic particles referred to as directional entropic forces.\n\nSome forces that are generally regarded as conventional forces have been argued to be actually entropic in nature. These theories remain controversial and are the subject of ongoing work. Matt Visser, professor of mathematics at Victoria University of Wellington, NZ in \"Conservative Entropic Forces\" criticizes selected approaches but generally concludes:\nIn 2009, Erik Verlinde argued that gravity can be explained as an entropic force. It claimed (similar to Jacobson's result) that gravity is a consequence of the \"information associated with the positions of material bodies\". This model combines the thermodynamic approach to gravity with Gerard 't Hooft's holographic principle. It implies that gravity is not a fundamental interaction, but an emergent phenomenon.\n\nIn the wake of the discussion started by Verlinde, entropic explanations for other fundamental forces have been suggested, including Coulomb's law, the electroweak and strong forces. The same approach was argued to explain dark matter, dark energy and Pioneer effect.\n\nIt was argued that causal entropic forces lead to spontaneous emergence of tool use and social cooperation. Causal entropic forces by definition maximize entropy production between the present and future time horizon, rather than just greedily maximizing instantaneous entropy production like typical entropic forces.\n\nA formal simultaneous connection between the mathematical structure of the discovered laws of nature, intelligence and the entropy-like measures of complexity was previously noted in 2000 by Andrei Soklakov in the context of Occam's razor principle.\n"}

Before becoming a pornographic actor, he worked as a truck driver. He started work in the pornography industry in 1994. He has been married since the early 1990s and has two children.\n\nIn August 2012, Marcus was the central person in an outbreak of syphilis among porn-performers leading to a hold on filming. The investigation revealed that Mr. Marcus was the first infected with syphilis and that he had provided incomplete information to the producers. Marcus first noticed evidence of the infection as a rash of brown spots on his hands. He attempted self-diagnosis by Internet searches and asking other people, with no success. He assumed it was due to stress or a vitamin deficiency and started taking vitamin supplements. On June 13, 2012, Marcus passed a medical test performed by Cutting Edge Testing because testing for syphilis was not standard at that time.\n\nIn May, a performer noticed marks on his penis and refused to work with him. Marcus believed this to just be a rough patch of skin or a reaction to a personal lubricant. On June 24, Marcus filmed a production for Bang Bros with noticeable white lesions on his penis. None of the other performers or production crew mentioned anything, and with the recent clean test, Marcus still believed it was due to vitamin deficiency. Marcus was first diagnosed with syphilis on July 12, 2012, by his personal doctor and received a shot of penicillin the next day. On July 14, 2012, Marcus went for another routine medical test with Talent Testing Services (TTS), which had added syphilis to its standard tests two weeks previously. This test was positive but was only a day after the injection. He waited the recommended 10 days from the initial test and was retested by TTS on July 21. The test was still positive but his doctor informed him that it was safe, he was not contagious and that his body would always show a base level reading for the infection.\n\nMarcus returned to work on July 24, and due to his history and reputation in the industry he was not asked for the full test and just showed the producer a copy on his cellphone, enabling him to hide the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) section relevant to syphilis. For a different production, Marcus faked paper documentation by folding the page of the original to hide the RPR results and making a photocopy. This was noticed by Mark Blazing of Blazing Bucks on August 7, a week after filming. During this time Marcus had worked three times, although the female performers from these productions all subsequently tested negative. The outbreak had occurred before he was diagnosed and received the penicillin.\n\nOn June 4, 2013, Marcus was sentenced to 30 days in jail and 36-month probation for \"knowingly exposing at least two co-stars to syphilis after testing positive for the disease days earlier\" \n\n\n"}

The term may be used synonymously with \"the present case\" or \"the case at bar\" by some lawyers.\n\nIn England and Wales, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Canada, Sri Lanka, and Israel it is generally considered inappropriate to comment publicly on cases \"sub judice\", which can be an offence in itself, leading to contempt of court proceedings. This is particularly true in criminal cases, where publicly discussing cases \"sub judice\" may constitute interference with due process.\n\nPrior to 1981 in English law the term was correctly used to describe material which would prejudice court proceedings by publication. \"Sub judice\" is now irrelevant to journalists because of the introduction of the Contempt of Court Act 1981. Under Section 2 of the Act, a substantial risk of serious prejudice can only be created by a media report when proceedings are active. Proceedings become active when there is an arrest, oral charge, issue of a warrant, or a summons.\n\nIn the United States, there are First Amendment concerns about stifling the right of free speech which prevent such tight restrictions on comments \"sub judice\". However, State Rules of Professional Conduct governing attorneys often place restrictions on the out-of-court statements an attorney may make regarding an ongoing case. Furthermore, there are still protections for criminal defendants, and those convicted in an atmosphere of a media circus have had their convictions overturned for a fairer trial. One example is the murder conviction of Sam Sheppard.\n"}

It is one of the oldest and most important teams in Mexico. They maintain a fierce rivalry with teams from the National Polytechnic Institute (Spanish: \"Instituto Politécnico Nacional\", or \"IPN\") particularly with its Miguel Hidalgo-based team from Santo Tomás, Águilas Blancas.\n\nThe team was founded in 1927 by a group of students led by the Noriega brothers, but it wasn't until 1931 when Pumas was officially the varsity team of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. In addition, American oil magnate Harry Ford Sinclair sponsored the team with generous donations until 1935. In the early years, Pumas had a long string of consecutive championships from 1933 to 1945 (including an appearance in the 1945 Sun Bowl; this was followed by the so-called \"Golden Age\" of 1946 to 1957. Between the years 1958 and 1969 the team consolidated its position within ONEFA, Mexico's league of American football. For the period 1970–1980 the university authorities decided to disband the team and create three teams (Cóndores/Condors; Aguilas Reales/Royal Eagles; and Guerreros Aztecas/Aztec Warriors), from 1981 to 1990 only the Cóndores could reclaim the tradition of the Pumas and win championships. In 1998, the University government decided to reduced to one team per campus and created Pumas CU and Acatlan. Unfortunately, conditions within the league and the existence of other powerful newcomer squads undermined the strength and dominance of the team. Its first position tradition vanished rapidly during the seasons of 1998 to 2007. From 1969 until 2002, the Pumas Dorados team consisted of a selection of the best players of all UNAM teams. This teams didn't play any regular season games, but rather the Pumas Dorados used to play a Classic game against the Burros Blancos at the end of season, until 2002 when this event was suspended.\n\n+ This is not the same team as previous Pumas Dorados teams. Championships in 2008 and 2010 were won by the Main Campus (CU). There is another Pumas team located in Acatlan Campus. Pumas Dorados currently represents a selection of the best players of both Pumas teams and the last selection was made in 2002 and played against a selection of the best players of the IPN.\n\nThe team has an historic rivalry with Aguilas Blancas IPN, due to both of them being the biggest public universities in the country. More recently, another mayor rivalry arise with Borregos Salvajes Mty, Borregos Salvajes CEM and Aztecas UDLAPAutenticos Tigres UANL.\n\nThe team plays at the Estadio Olímpico Universitario in Mexico City, inaugurated in 1952 with the game between Pumas and Burros Blancos.

{"id": "2025770", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2025770", "title": "Snakes and Earrings", "text": "Snakes and Earrings\n\nThough \"Snakes and Earrings\" received mixed reviews, popular and academic critics have noted its significance in contemporary Japanese literature, not only for its authentic portrayal of post-bubble Japanese youth culture, but also for the controversial commercialization of its author's personal life. The novel has sold more than a million copies in Japan, has been translated into sixteen languages, and was adapted into a 2008 Yukio Ninagawa film starring Yuriko Yoshitaka.\n\nA young woman named Lui admires her new boyfriend Ama's split tongue, which she likens to the forked tongue of a snake. Having experimented with large ear piercings, she decides that she wants to try the same body modification as Ama. Lui and Ama visit a bisexual body modification and tattoo artist named Shiba, who begins the process of inserting progressively larger tongue studs. Lui finds herself interested in Shiba, returns to the shop without Ama, and secretly begins a violent sexual relationship with Shiba involving bondage and sadomasochism. \n\nWhile walking to a train station one night, Lui, Ama, and Lui's friend Maki are confronted in Shinjuku by two apparent gangsters, one of whom grabs Lui's breast while insulting her. Ama punches both men. After one of the men flees, Ama continues to beat Lui's attacker, using the heavy rings on his hand to knock out the gangster's teeth. Ama gives the teeth to Lui as a symbol of his love for her. Despite Ama's obvious affection, Lui feels disconnected from Ama and continues to have a sexual relationship with Shiba, who is creating an intricate tattoo that covers her entire back. Lui later sees a television news story about a gangster who was beaten to death in Shinjuku, and makes Ama change his appearance to avoid recognition by the police. \n\nOne day Ama unexpectedly disappears. His corpse is found with evidence of sexual torture, rape, and strangulation. After learning of Ama's demise, Lui tries to speed up the process of splitting her tongue by inserting larger studs too quickly, causing intense pain, and she stops eating, instead only drinking alcohol. She then discovers evidence suggesting that Shiba was Ama's rapist and murderer. Lui suspects a previous sexual relationship between Shiba and Ama, but when the police investigator asks her whether Ama was bisexual, she insists that he was not. With Ama gone, Shiba completes Lui's tattoo, Lui and Shiba's relationship falls into a more domestic pattern, and Lui considers putting in a larger tongue stud.\n\nAcademic analysis of \"Snakes and Earrings\" has focused on themes of subcultural resistance, gender roles, and commodification. Cultural studies scholar Mark Driscoll, writing in \"Cultural Critique\", argued that while the book's graphic descriptions of tattooing, self-harm, and violent sexual activities revealed subcultures unfamiliar to many readers, Kanehara's portrayal of her characters as \"consumerist, closed-off, and unwilling or unable to communicate with people outside their tribe\" reinforced popular stereotypes about Japanese youth, particularly the part-time workers called freeters. David Holloway, writing in \"Japanese Language and Literature\", came to a similar conclusion, noting that despite the depiction of Lui as a fringe character rejecting society's rules, she ends up assuming a domestic role consistent with expectations of Japanese women in mainstream society.\n\nIn \"Japan Forum\", Rachel DiNitto argued that expecting the subcultural elements of the book to express resistance to mainstream Japanese culture actually reflected a Western literary bias. Instead, she proposed that Kanehara's novel expresses resistance through Lui's experience of her own physical body in a society emphasizing commodification and virtuality. Reuben Welsh offered a similar interpretation, pointing to a specific episode in the book in which Lui crushes and eats the teeth that Ama gave to her as an \"act of osmosis\" that \"can be taken as an example of finding something lasting and valuable amidst the transient commodity culture\". Both DiNitto and Holloway have also suggested that \"Snakes and Earrings\" resembles works of Japanese literature published in the years immediately following World War II, such as Tamura Taijiro's \"Gate of Flesh\", in which characters regain control over their own bodies after coercion and defeat, then use their bodies as sites of protest.\n\nAs an elementary school student in Japan, Hitomi Kanehara lost interest in academic topics and began to skip school in order to socialize with friends. Her father Mizuhito Kanehara, a professor of sociology at Hosei University, brought her along on a year-long research trip to San Francisco, where she occasionally attended an American school. During her stay in the United States, with her father's permission, she began reading stories by Ryū Murakami and Amy Yamada that contained strong violent and sexual themes.\n\nKanehara returned to Japan and attended middle school, but became anorexic and engaged in self-harm. Against the wishes of her mother Chieko, Kanehara dropped out of her first year of high school, left home, and began to write stories, including \"Snakes and Earrings\", that drew on her own experiences with cutting, suicidal thoughts, body modification, and living with different boyfriends. She has described \"Snakes and Earrings\" as the story she \"had to write\". Her father continued to support her writing, arranged for her to participate in a fiction workshop for sophomores at his university, and edited the \"Snakes and Earrings\" manuscript before it was submitted for literary prizes.\n\n\"Snakes and Earrings\" won the 27th for unpublished stories in 2003. The story was published for the first time in the November 2003 issue of the literary magazine \"Shōsetsu Subaru\". In January 2004, \"Snakes and Earrings\" won the 130th Akutagawa Prize. While \"Snakes and Earrings\" was the overall favorite of the Akutagawa Prize committee, the award was shared with Risa Wataya for her story \"Keritai Senaka\", making the 20-year old Kanehara and the 19-year old Wataya the youngest winners in the prize's history. Akutagawa Prize committee member Ryu Murakami particularly praised the \"radical depiction of our time\" in the winning works. \n\nKanehara appeared at the Akutagawa Prize announcement ceremony wearing \"an off-the-shoulder, cut jersey shirt with exposed bra straps, a flared mini skirt, stiletto heels, mid-thigh nylons, multiple earrings and grey-tinted contact lenses\". Press accounts of the event contrasted Kanehara's youthful, street-style image with the image of the \"demure and old-fashioned\" Wataya. Interviews and photos of the winning authors appeared not only in national newspapers, but also in Japanese editions of \"GQ\" and \"Cosmopolitan\" as well as the adult-oriented magazine \"Weekly Playboy\". Kanehara's interviews often discussed troubles in her personal life, such as thoughts of suicide and self-harm, reinforcing the public perception of Kanehara as an authentic narrator of Japanese youth culture.\n\nThe \"unprecedented commercialization\" of Kanehara's image raised questions about her novel's literary merits. Critics claimed that \"Snakes and Earrings\" was chosen for its marketing value to younger audiences, and that its selection was evidence of declining literary standards, but much of the criticism focused on Kanehara rather than on the novel. In an English-language review of both Akutagawa Prize winning novels, Janet Ashby of \"The Japan Times\" criticized the \"element of sexism\" in the media hype over the two novelists, but also observed that both stories were \"somewhat of a letdown\", with \"Snakes and Earrings\" having a \"particularly unsatisfactory ending\". \n\nAfter winning the Akutagawa Prize, \"Snakes and Earrings\" was republished alongside Wataya's winning story in the literary magazine \"Bungeishunjū\". The story was also republished in book form by Shueisha. Within three months of the prize announcement, the \"Bungeishunjū\" issue containing the prize-winning stories had sold over 1.1 million copies, and the book edition of \"Snakes and Earrings\" had sold over 500,000 copies. Contemporary coverage noted that many middle-aged men bought Kanehara's work, but preferred the magazine edition to the book edition, as the book cover was designed to appeal to women readers. The unusual sales numbers and media spectacle surrounding the book drew international attention, including a profile in \"The New York Times\" that called the novel \"a powerful portrait of this post-bubble generation\".\n\nShortly after the Japanese book was published, Dutton acquired the English translation rights. In 2005 an English version of \"Snakes and Earrings\", translated by David Karashima, was published by Dutton in the United States and Vintage Books in the United Kingdom. It received generally positive reviews. \"Kirkus Reviews\" called the book \"fascinating and unnerving\", \"Marie Claire\" called it \"riveting\", and \"The Village Voice\" called it \"a gnarly blast of Tokyo nihilism\". Writing for \"The Guardian\", Maya Jaggi praised the book as \"a debut novel about alienation that is shocking but not sensational\" and observed that it \"offers more than sociological interest\".\n\nReviews of the English translation also noted the broader significance of \"Snakes and Earrings\" in contemporary Japanese literature. Writing in the \"Financial Times\", Andrew Lee praised Kanehara for describing Tokyo youth culture with \"simple, visceral eloquence\", and cited \"Snakes and Earrings\" as an exemplar of a literary trend elevating high school girls to the iconic status of geisha in Japanese culture. In \"The Independent\", former \"Japan Times\" editor Victoria James grouped the novel with similarly explicit work by Ami Sakurai and Mari Akasaka, lauding the book's quality but expressing skepticism about any long-term mainstream impact of novels by young women about sex.\n\nCriticism of the English translation of \"Snakes and Earrings\" concerned its length and ending. While praising Kanehara's detailed descriptions and character development, Prudence Peiffer's review in \"Library Journal\" found the book's \"hasty conclusion\" predictable, with the story falling short in both metaphorical and literal senses. Writing for \"Artforum\", Christine Thomas similarly praised Kanehara's \"keen observation of everyday reality\", but noted that the ending was strained by its efforts to find redemption for the main character. Karen Karbo of \"Entertainment Weekly\" compared \"Snakes and Earrings\" to the Bret Easton Ellis novel \"Less Than Zero\", calling the ending \"both chilling and oddly moving\" but questioning the book's originality.\n\nA film adaptation of \"Snakes and Earrings\", directed by Yukio Ninagawa and starring Yuriko Yoshitaka, Kengo Kora, and Arata Iura, started principal photography in November 2007. Ninagawa changed the location of the story to Shibuya from its original Shinjuku in order to film a panoramic opening scene at Shibuya Crossing that he claimed was inspired by the Werner Herzog film \"Fitzcarraldo\". He also required lead actress Yoshitaka to perform nude in several scenes as a condition of taking the role.\n\nWhile the film was in production, Yoshitaka was involved in a serious car accident and spent several days in intensive care before returning to the set. She later claimed that the experience helped her to understand her character's pain. Most of the tattoos and piercings in the film, including Lui's tongue piercing, were achieved through makeup and computer-generated effects. Kanehara wrote original lyrics for the film's theme song, which was performed by Chara.\n\nThe R-15 film was released in Japan in September 2008. It ranked 15th at the box office in its opening weekend with approximately US$100,000 in gross receipts, and eventually grossed approximately US$510,000 in domestic theatrical release. Yoshitaka received a Best Newcomer Award at the 32nd Japan Academy Prize ceremony for her performance, as well as a Best Newcomer Prize at the 51st Blue Ribbon Awards and a Best Newcomer prize at the Japanese Movie Critics Awards.\n\nThe film was also shown internationally at film festivals, including the 2008 Pusan Film Festival and the 2009 New York Asian Film Festival. Writing for \"Variety\", Russell Edwards panned the film, leveling criticism at weak directing and the performances of the male leads, while calling Yoshitaka an \"alluring actress\" who nevertheless \"lacks the chops to carry the role\". Charles Webb, writing for \"Screen Anarchy\", also gave the film a negative review, calling it \"the worst kind of art film that is unable to stimulate given its vacuous characters and inane situations\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2025781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2025781", "title": "Argentine Army", "text": "Argentine Army\n\nThe Argentine Army (\"Ejército Argentino\", EA) is the land armed force branch of the Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic and the senior military service of the country. Under the Argentine Constitution, the President of Argentina is the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, exercising his or her command authority through the Minister of Defense.\n\nThe Army's official foundation date is May 29, 1810 (celebrated in Argentina as the \"Army Day\"), four days after the Spanish colonial administration in Buenos Aires was overthrown. The new national army was formed out of several pre-existent colonial militia units and locally manned regiments; most notably the Infantry Regiment \"Patricios\", which to this date is still an active unit.\n\nAs of 2019, the active element of the Argentine Army numbered some 70,000 military personnel.\n\nSeveral armed expeditions were sent to the Upper Peru (now Bolivia), Paraguay, Uruguay and Chile to fight Spanish forces and secure Argentina's newly gained independence. The most famous of these expeditions was the one led by General José de San Martín, who led a 5000-man army across the Andes Mountains to expel the Spaniards from Chile and later from Perú. While the other expeditions failed in their goal of bringing all the dependencies of the former Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata under the new government in Buenos Aires, they prevented the Spaniards from crushing the rebellion.\nDuring the civil wars of the first half of the 19th century, the Argentine Army became fractionalized under the leadership of the so-called \"caudillos\" (\"leaders\" or \"warlords\"), provincial leaders who waged a war against the centralist Buenos Aires administration. However, the Army was briefly re-unified during the war with the Brazilian Empire. (1824–1827).\n\nIt was only with the establishment of a Constitution (which explicitly forbade the provinces from maintaining military forces of their own) and a national government recognized by all the provinces that the Army became a single force, absorbing the older provincial militias. The Army went on to fight the War of the Triple Alliance in the 1860s together with Brazil and Uruguay against Paraguay. After that war, the Army became involved in Argentina's \"Conquista del Desierto\" (\"Conquest of the Desert\"): the campaign to occupy Patagonia and root out the natives, who conducted looting raids throughout the country.\n\nBetween 1880 and 1930, the Army sought to become a professional force without active involvement in politics, even though many a political figure -President Julio Argentino Roca, for example- benefitted from a past military career. The Army prevented the fall of the government in a number of Radical-led uprisings. Meanwhile, the military in general and the Army, in particular, contributed to develop Argentina's unsettled southern frontier and its nascent industrial complex.\n\nThe main foreign influence during this period was, by and large, the Prussian (and then German) doctrine. Partly because of that, during both World Wars most of the officers supported the Germans, more or less openly, while the Argentine Navy favored the British instead.\nIn 1930, a small group of Army forces (not more than 600 troops) deposed President Hipólito Yrigoyen without much response from the rest of the Army and the Navy. This was the beginning of a long history of political intervention by the military. Another coup, in 1943, was responsible for bringing an obscure colonel into the political limelight: Juan Perón.\n\nEven though Perón had the support of the military during his two consecutive terms of office (1946–1952 and 1952–1955), his increasingly repressive government alienated many officers, which finally led to a military uprising which overthrew him in September 1955. Between 1955 and 1973 the Army and the rest of the military became vigilant over the possible re-emergence of Peronism in the political arena, which led to two new coups against elected Presidents in 1962 (deposing Arturo Frondizi) and 1966 (ousting Arturo Illia). Political infighting eroded discipline and cohesion within the army, to the extent that there was armed fighting between contending military units during the early 1960s.\n\nThe military government which ruled Argentina between 1966 and 1973 saw the growing activities of groups such as Montoneros and the ERP, and also a very important social movement. During Héctor Cámpora's first months of government, a rather moderate and left-wing Peronist, approximatively 600 social conflicts, strikes and factory occupations had taken place. Following the June 20, 1973 Ezeiza massacre, left and right-wing Peronism broke apart, while the Triple A death squad, organized by José López Rega, closest advisor to María Estela Martínez de Perón, started a campaign of assassinations against left-wing opponents. But Isabel Perón herself was ousted during the March 1976 coup by a military \"junta\".\n\nThe new military government, self-named Proceso de Reorganización Nacional, put a stop to the guerrilla's campaigns, but soon it became known that extremely violent methods and severe violations of human rights had taken place, in what the dictatorship called a \"Dirty War\" — a term refused by jurists during the 1985 Trial of the Juntas. Batallón de Inteligencia 601 (the 601st Intelligence Battalion) became infamous during this period. It was a special military intelligence service set up in the late 1970s, active in the Dirty War and Operation Condor, and disbanded in 2000. Its personnel collected information on and infiltrated guerrilla groups and human rights organisations, and coordinated killings, kidnappings and other abuses. The unit also participated in the training of Nicaraguan Contras with US assistance, including from John Negroponte.\n\nMeanwhile, the Guevarist People's Revolutionary Army (ERP), led by Roberto Santucho and inspired by Che Guevara's foco theory, began a rural insurgency in the province of Tucumán, in the mountainous northwest of Argentina. It started the campaign with no more than 100 men and women of the Marxist ERP guerrilla force and ended with about 300 in the mountains (including reinforcements in the form of the elite Montoneros 65-strong \"Compañía de Monte\" (\"Jungle Company\") and the ERP's \"Decididos de Córdoba\" Urban Company), which the Argentine Army managed to defeat, but at a cost.\n\nOn 5 January 1975, an Army DHC-6 transport plane was downed near the Monteros mountains, apparently shot down by the Guerrillas. All thirteen on board were killed. The military believe a heavy machine gun had downed the aircraft.\n\nIn response, Ítalo Luder, President of the National Assembly who acted as interim President substituting himself to Isabel Perón who was ill for a short period, signed in February 1975 the secret presidential decree 261, which ordered the army to neutralize and/or annihilate the insurgency in Tucumán, the smallest province of Argentina. \"Operativo Independencia\" gave power to the Armed Forces to \"\"execute all military operations necessary for the effects of neutralizing or annihilating the action of subversive elements acting in the Province of Tucumán.\"\" Santucho had declared a \"liberated zone\" in Tucuman and demanded Soviet-backed protection for its borders as well as proper treatment of captured guerrillas as POWs.\n\nThe Argentine Army Fifth Brigade, then consisting of the 19th, 20th and 29th Mountain Infantry Regiments and commanded by Brigadier-General Acdel Vilas received the order to move to Famailla in the foothills of the Monteros mountains on 8 February 1975. While fighting the guerrillas in the jungle, Vilas concentrated on uprooting the ERP support network in the towns, using tactics later adopted nationwide, as well as a civic action campaign. The Argentine security forces used techniques no different from their US and French counterparts in Vietnam.\n\nBy July 1975, anti-guerrilla commandos were mounting search-and-destroy missions in the mountains. Army special forces discovered Santucho's base camp in August, then raided the ERP urban headquarters in September. Most of the Compañia de Monte's general staff was killed in October and was dispersed by the end of the year.\n\nThe leadership of the rural guerrilla force was mostly eradicated and many of the ERP guerrillas and civilian sympathizers in Tucumán were either killed or forcefully disappeared. Efforts to restrain the rural guerrilla activity to Tucumán, however, remained unsuccessful despite the use of 24 recently arrived US-made Bell UH-1H Huey troop-transport helicopters. In early October, the 5th Brigade suffered a major blow at the hands of the Montoneros, when more than one hundred, and possibly several hundred\n\nIn the aftermath, twelve soldiers and two policemen were killed and several wounded. The sophistication of the operation, and the getaway cars and safehouses they used to escape from the crash-landing site, suggest several hundred guerrillas and their supporters were involved. The Argentine security forces admitted to 43 army troops killed in action in Tucuman, although this figure does not take into account police and Gendarmerie troops, and the soldiers who died defending their barracks in Formosa province on 5 October 1975. By December 1975, the Argentine military could, with some justification claim that it was winning the 'Dirty War', but it was dismayed to find no evidence of overall victory.\n\nOn 23 December 1975, several hundred ERP fighters with the help of hundreds of underground supporters, staged an all-out battle with the 601st Arsenal Battalion nine miles (14 km) from Buenos Aires and occupied four local police stations and a regimental headquarters. 63 guerrillas, seven army troops and three policemen were killed. In addition 20 civilians were killed in the crossfire. Many of the civilian deaths occurred when the guerrillas and supporting militants burned 15 city buses near the arsenal to hamper military reinforcements. This development was to have far-reaching ramifications. On 30 December 1975, urban guerrillas exploded a bomb inside the Army's headquarters in Buenos Aires, injuring at least six soldiers.\n\nThe Montoneros movement successfully utilized divers in underwater infiltrations and blew the pier where the Argentine destroyer ARA Santísima Trinidad was being built, on 22 August 1975. The ship was effectively immobilized for several years.\n\nFrench journalist Marie-Monique Robin has found in the archives of the \"Quai d'Orsay\", the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, the original document proving that a 1959 agreement between Paris and Buenos Aires instaured a \"permanent French military mission,\" formed of veterans who had fought in the Algerian War, and which was located in the offices of the chief of staff of the Argentine Army. She showed how Valéry Giscard d'Estaing's government secretly collaborated with Jorge Rafael Videla's junta in Argentina and with Augusto Pinochet's regime in Chile.\n\nGreen deputies Noël Mamère, Martine Billard and Yves Cochet deposed on September 10, 2003 a request for the constitution of a Parliamentary Commission on the \"role of France in the support of military regimes in Latin America from 1973 to 1984\" before the Foreign Affairs Commission of the National Assembly, presided by Edouard Balladur. Apart from \"Le Monde\", newspapers remained silent about this request. However, deputy Roland Blum, in charge of the Commission, refused to hear Marie-Monique Robin, and published in December 2003 a 12 pages report qualified by Robin as the summum of bad faith. It claimed that no agreement had been signed, despite the agreement found by Robin in the \"Quai d'Orsay\"\n\nWhen Minister of Foreign Affairs Dominique de Villepin traveled to Chile in February 2004, he claimed that no cooperation between France and the military regimes had occurred.\n\nOn 2 April 1982, the Argentine Army contributed forces to Operation Rosario, the 1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands, and the occupation that followed. Army forces also opposed the amphibious landing in San Carlos Water on 21 May, and fought the British at Goose Green, Mount Kent, and the battles around Port Stanley that lead to the ceasefire of 14 June followed by the surrender of the Argentine troops.\n\nAt 04:40 hours on May 1, An Avro 698 Vulcan B.2 bomber dropped 21 1000 pound bombs on the airport runway of Port Stanley, taking the Argentine anti-aircraft defense by surprise. From that moment, they entered into a state of alert. The runway suffered a hole twenty meters in diameter, however, the aircraft could continue operating. The Royal Navy had divided its naval forces into two task groups; one, led by the aircraft carrier HMS Invincible (R05), located north of East Falkland/Soledad Island, 130 kilometers from Puerto Argentino; the other, led by the aircraft carrier HMS \"Hermes\", was located northeast, 93 kilometers from the coast. From the \"Hermes\" departed the Harrier GR.3 attack aircraft that unleashed several attacks on the Argentine forces. At 08:25 the Argentine radars reported new air attacks. Then the Argentine anti-aircraft defense was prepared, with guns Oerlikon GDF-002 of 35 millimeters and Skyguard systems, endowment of the Group of Artillery of Antiaircraft Defense 601 (GADA 601). Towards 08:30 hours, a violent battle took place between the Argentine gunners and the British aviators. The British dropped 450 kilograms bombs, the Argentine antiaircraft artillery brought down two Harrier, four were damaged and moved away from the area and a third Harrier was shot down by a Cat missile from the Argentine Navy. After that, the British did not return to attack flying at low altitude, losing effectiveness.\n\nThe situation at the Military Air Base () \"Cóndor\" was very different; the Darwin airfield housed a squadron of FMA IA 58 Pucará attack aircraft and did not have enough anti-aircraft defenses; it lacked shelters, fuel depots and masking zones. Three British Aerospace Sea Harrier FRS.1 destroyed the planes on the runway, causing eight deaths and nine serious injuries. The anti-aircraft defense could not react because they had been informed that the Pucara would be evacuated from the base to Bourbon Island, so they had to be vigilant from 08:25 to not shoot down their own aircraft. When the British air attack took place, believing that it was about the Argentine planes, they did not open fire.\n\nThe troops of the 25th Infantry Regiment () deployed in the Frecynet peninsula to provide protection to the BAM \"Malvinas\" were subjected to intense naval gunfire, and must remain in their shelters. Around 18:00 hours, an Argentine mortar fire of 81 millimeters supported by guns from 3rd Artillery Group thwarted a helicopter landing of British troops.\n\nAt 08:10 hours on May 21, the Canberra troop transport entered the channel of Puerto de San Carlos, the landing had been preceded by three hours of intense naval gunfire that destroyed the land. While the British massively disembarked troops and equipment, they were observed by soldiers led by First Lieutenant Carlos Daniel Esteban of Company \"C\" of the 25th Infantry Regiment. At 08:20 hours, several boats guarded from the air by numerous helicopters put to the first Englishmen on the mainland. The British infantry advanced towards the town of San Carlos. First Lieutenant Esteban informed Puerto Argentino radially of what was happening, and was ordered to move eastwards, so that they would not be surrounded by a helicopter descent. At 08:40 hours, while two British companies arrived at the town and a Sea King helicopter tried to alight with its cargo of soldiers, Esteban and his 42 men attacked, they spurred the helicopter which went away engulfed in flames and fell into the sea. The British infantry opened fire with mortars and machine guns on the positions of the 25th Regiment, while a Gazelle helicopter rushed on the Argentines, ready to fire their rockets. But again the curtain of fire spread by the Combat Team \"Güemes\" was lethal. This second machine also rushed to the waters. A third Gazelle launched the attack suffered the same fate. The Argentine soldiers moved, avoiding the search for a fourth Gazelle to which they again attacked with their portable weapons. This last machine walked away engulfed in flames and smoke.\n\nEsteban and his troop waited for two hours for the withdrawal of \"Gato\" (the Support Section of Second Lieutenant Reyes) from height 234. The \"Güemes\" combat team retired without suffering any casualties, leaving behind three destroyed Gazelles, one King seriously damaged and probably a score of enemy casualties. These 42 men returned on foot to Puerto Argentino, arriving on May 26. This courageous action and that of Second Lieutenant Reyes, who opened fire with his 105 mm guns on the British fleet, turned out to be the only terrestrial opposition that was made to the English landing in San Carlos.\n\nWhen the British forces consolidated his beachhead in Port San Carlos he set out to start the march towards Stanley; but to achieve this, it had to face the \"Mercedes\" Grouping (642 troops), composed of the 12th and 25th Infantry Regiments, the 601th Anti-aircraft Defense Artillery Group, a section of the 8th Infantry Regiment, the 9th Engineering Company, and the 4th Airborne Artillery Group.\n\nOn May 23, an attack by British aircraft destroyed two Puma helicopters and an Agusta A109 helicopter; then, on the afternoon of the 27th, there were English air strikes on the positions of Company \"A\" and Battery \"A\" of the Airborne Artillery Group 4. At 22:50 hours on May 28, a naval gunfire was unleashed. on the \"A\" Company, and during the early morning of the 29th, the English Infantry advanced on the positions of the \"A\" Company, beating it with intense mortar fire and machine guns. The center of gravity of the British attack came from Sussex Camilla Creek. The Argentineans counterattacked, with their mortars of 81 and 120 millimeters they executed fire on the British rearguard, and fighting furiously, they began their retreat. The western sector had given way but, fighting hand to hand and at close distances, it was possible to restore the situation and rebuild the front. After the ammunition was exhausted, the Support Section withdrew, abandoning the heavy weapons. At 06:00 hours, the massive volume of English fire was reducing the Argentine defenses. Lieutenant Roberto Estévez occupied a position in the Prairie Goose School and executed a counterattack at Boca House that caused many British casualties, thus achieving the re-composition of the first line of defense. During this hard fight, he lost his life. They continued directing the artillery fire, through the communications team, in the first instance Corporal Mario Castro, and after his death, the soldier Fabricio Edgar Carrascul, who finally also fell dead.\n\nAt 08:30 hours the Company \"A\" had experienced many casualties and the survivors withdrew to the population. When retiring, the second lieutenant Marcelo Raul Colombo made an attack with two mortars of 81 millimeters, beating the North of the positions of the Company \"To\" to allow the retreat of those cash. Meanwhile, doctors at the Army and Air Force roamed the sectors carrying out the first aid to the wounded and deriving the most serious aid stations at Goose Green. At 09:30 hours, the enemy stopped their attack and retreated to the North. At that time, the defensive position of the Task Force \"Mercedes\" was reinforced and two helicopters of the Army Aviation landed to evacuate the wounded despite the constant enemy fire. At 10:30 pm on May 28, the effective charge of second lieutenant Juan José Gómez Centurión vigorously fought back and managed to reach heights located two kilometers north of Goose Green. At 12:30, the British forces launched a massive final attack. His strong field artillery fire and mortars punished the positions of the 8th Infantry Regiment, the \"A\" Company and members of the Darwin Services Company. The situation became untenable for the Argentinians who had fought to the limit of their logistical possibilities. At 9:30 p.m. on May 29, the head of the Task Force \"Mercedes\" reported that the situation could no longer be sustained. At 11:00 hours on May 30 there was a ceasefire and the end of the largest land battle of the Falklands campaign.\n\nThe Fitzroy Bridge was located on a river southwest of Port Stanley and it was a one-hundred-meter-long construction, with a wooden walkway and thick concrete piles. It crossed the deep estuary and communicated the town of Fitzroy, where there was a rural establishment, with Port Stanely. Its strategic importance was fundamental: through the watercourse, ships could arrive to disembark troops, shortening the road to Port Stanley. The troops that had been guarding it had retreated without being able to blow up the charges that had been installed on the bridge before, given that due to the inclement weather their wicks were wet and failed. First Lieutenant Horacio Dario Blanco, belonging to the 601th Combat Engineer Company, then received the mission, so with two non-commissioned officers and several soldiers prepared the weapons and loaded the only available explosive 40 kg of TNT. The explosive, as a fast charge, was placed in the stirrup of the first bank and also in the first two supports of the mentioned bridge, loads of TNT were affirmed. It was difficult to install an adequate security system, since in the place there was no vegetation to hide the bivouac that they raised in a hollow, which was about 300 meters from the bridge. On May 30, the British occupied Mount Kent, surpassing by the Northwest the position in which the Engineers were. Between the 30th of May and the 1st of June, British helicopters began to loiter around the Fitzroy bridge area. On June 2, the company manager informed them by radio of the troops stationed on the bridge, which, due to enemy air superiority, would be impossible to transfer by helicopter to Port Stanley; the return had to be done by his own means and on foot. At 2:30 pm on June 2, 1982, Lieutenant Blanco \"fired\" the charges, destroying the bridge almost completely.\n\nAs a result of the blowing up of the bridge, two of the warships that had arrived carrying a regiment of Welsh Guards could not land and had to wait. While they waited, on June 8, 1982, they were attacked by airplanes of the Argentine Air Force. As a result, more than 50 men were killed, more than 100 were injured and both ships were knocked out.\n\nA group of troops of 602th Commando Company descended from a helicopter of the Argentine Army in the vicinity of Mount Simon. Its mission was to install an observation post to monitor the movements of the English troops that had landed in San Carlos. The commandos reached the crest of the mountain and from there, they could see a corridor of Chinook helicopters that supplied the British vanguard. They tried to communicate by radio and report British movements, but interference prevented them, and in fact, the enemy's electronic detectors discovered them.\n\nBefore the intense snowfall, the troops spent the night, and at the following dawn began the retreat to the area of Fitz Roy, where they would contact the Engineers. On May 30, after six hours of walking, they stopped to rest in a shelter called Top Malo House. They crossed the stream while it was getting dark and settled in the cabin. They did not know that an English helicopter was arriving in the area, with 35 commands from the Mountain and Artic Warfare Cadre. The lieutenant Ernesto Emilio Espinosa, who from one of the windows of the first floor gave security with his rifle of special shooter, discovered the advance and gave the alert shouting: \"They are English, there they come!\". At the same time, he began to shoot his enemies. Seconds later, a devastating firepower converged on the fragile walls of the building and, simultaneously, four 66 millimeters rockets hit the house.\n\nThen, a large fire of automatic weapons crossed the house side by side, and was also hit by four Carl Gustav anti-tank rockets of 84 millimeters. The post began to catch fire, inside everything was smoke, fire and explosions. In those hard moments, Lieutenant Espinosa shouted: \"Come out, I cover you!\" Before a grenade that entered through a window hit him full in the chest and killed him. Those valuable minutes that the lieutenant offered to his comrades allowed them to leave the house and continue fighting. Another commando also fell in the fight, Sergeant Mateo Antonio Sbert.\n\nThe \"B\" Company of the 7th Infantry Regiment and a section of machine guns of the Marines were covering the west, northwest and north of the first line of defensive position, on the heights of Mount Longdon.\n\nOn June 8, advanced patrols detected the approach of British Infantry forces. Fire was ordered to open with heavy mortars and support was requested on the British advance zone, which consequently fell back towards the Northwest. In the following three days there were several air attacks. At 20:30 hours on June 11, the enemy artillery fire intensified and the telephone lines were cut; nevertheless, the communicants, under English fire, managed to restore them only an hour later.\n\nAt that time, the British had already reached the position of the 1st Section of the \"7th Infantry\", and during the counterattack, their leader, Second Lieutenant Juan Domingo Baldini, and Corporal Ríos fell without life. At 11pm, the massive English attack on Mount Longdon began. About midnight, Lieutenant Hugo Aníbal Quiroga, head of the 1st Section of the Company of Engineers 10, was ordered to launch an attack on the sector where Baldini's 1st Section was surrounded. The engineers confronted the British and got them to retreat. But new English troops pressed on the flanks. The melee battles multiplied, and yet they were able to stop the English advance controlling the situation. On June 12, the 1st Section \"C\" arrived under the command of Lieutenant Raul Castañeda and was ordered to execute a counter-attack in a northwest direction to surround the British who besieged the section of the 10th Engineering Company and what was left of the 1st Section of Baldini. His attack achieved the withdrawal of the British, but a massive mortar fire stopped the Argentine impetus and led to a new English attack.\n\nAt 05:00 hours on June 12, the British attacked from the North, Northwest, West and Southwest with six companies, supported by intense artillery and mortar fire. By then, the Argentines no longer had troops available to try a counterattack and their ammunition was almost exhausted. Despite the Argentine artillery fire that punished the English positions, the British attack did not yield. At 06:30 hours, the commander of the Agrupación Port Argentino ordered the withdrawal of the \"B\" Company from the 7th Infantry Regiment to Wireless Ridge and, once it withdrew, execute massive artillery fire on the Monte heights. Longdon. Later, the withdrawal to Port Stanley was ordered.\n\nOn the night of June 11, 1982, after intense ground and naval artillery fire, the English of the 45th Command Corps attacked the positions of the 4th Infantry Regiment, which were organized into two sectors: the Two Sisers in charge of his second boss, Major Ricardo Cordón, and that of Mount Harriet, under the command of his boss, Lieutenant Colonel Diego Soria. Nearby, forming the first line of defense, on Mount Two Sisters north, were the positions of Company \"B\" of the 6th Infantry Regiment and, on Mount Longdon, Company B of the 7th Infantry Regiment was located.\nDuring all the morning the Argentine Army fought against very superior troops in numbers and materials. The 3rd Company of the 4th Infantry Regiment suffered violent attacks, rejecting again and again the enemy's attacks. Argentine machine guns and mortars kept the British at bay, who, protected by darkness, tried to climb the slopes.\n\nAfter hours of fighting, the ammunition began to become scarce and the \"6th Infantry\" retreated fighting, while the British seized Mount \"Two Sisters\" north. From there, the \"4th Infantry\" was attacked, which, faced with the risk of being surrounded, retreated in an orderly battle towards Tumbledown, joining the forces of the 5th Marine Infantry Battalion that controlled those heights.\n\nThe 5th Marine Infantry Battalion was the one that withstood the British attacks in the combats by the Tumbledown mount. The British advanced with three columns and climbed the mountain to the north, launching an assault on the 5th Section of the Battalion. Later, a company of Scots Guards attacked the 4th Section of the \"Nacar\" Company.\n\nThe day before, the British had entered a minefield, leaving several of their personnel wounded. When the 5th Section of the battalion could not withstand the British attacks, it had to retreat leaving an unprotected platoon of the 4th Infantry Regiment, which fought side by side with the Marines. Under the crossfire of the British machine guns, the squad leader, second lieutenant Oscar Augusto Silva and five of his soldiers lost their lives.\n\nBy 9:00 a.m., the Scots Guards had gained the high ground east of Tumbledown Mountain and the Gurkhas commenced deploying across the heavily shelled saddle from Tumbledown south to Mount William, which they took with the loss of 8 wounded. The 2nd Battalion Scots Guards had lost eight dead and 43 wounded. The Welsh Guards had lost one dead, the Royal Engineers had also lost one dead, and the Gurkhas had sustained altogether 13 wounded, including the artillery observation officer, Captain Keith Swinton.\n\nThe Scots Guards took 30 prisoners, several of them RI 6 soldiers from Bravo Company. The bodies of 30 Argentine Army and Marine soldiers were found in and around the 5th Marine Battalion perimeter. Reaching the rear positions of N Marine Company, Second Lieutenant Franco took the time to set free several German Shepherds left behind in the Argentine retreat from Tumbledown. \n\nThe troops of the 4th Infantry Regiment under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Soria, prepared to face the troops of 42 British Commandos, which, after breaking through a minefield, unleashed a violent attack from the West on the 1st Company of the 4th Infantry Regiment and then from the North, on the 2nd Company also of the \"4 Infantry\" which was reinforced by the 1st \"B\" section of the 12th Infantry Regiment.\n\nThe battle had begun on the night of June 11 with a naval bombardment of HMS Yarmouth. 42 British Commandos had the support of a Battery of the 29th Royal Artillery Regiment. The 1st Battalion of Welsh Guards remained as a reserve.\n\nThe fight was violent, even reaching, in some cases, hand-to-hand combat. The Argentine field artillery, composed of the Artillery 3 and Airborne 4 groups, supported the fight of the 4th Infantry Regiment on Mount Harriet and, although its fire retarded the enemy's advance, it could not stop it.\n\nAt 03:00 in the morning, the Support Section had exhausted the ammunition and had to retreat to Moody Brook. The British gained possession of the height and from there intensified their attacks on Mount Two Sisters. Likewise, the troops that managed to retreat were added to the 10th Armored Cavalry Exploration Squadron.\n\nBetter provided and organized, the British Army continued its march towards Port Stanley. The Argentine soldiers had battled intensely. In fact, the non-commissioned officer John Cartledge of the Royal Marines, who declared after the battle, said: \"They engaged us in a strong struggle from beginning to end. They used adequate tactics to deal with us and they did not make the task easy for us. \"\n\nOn June 14, 1982, the head of the 5th Marine Infantry Battalion reported that he retreated eastward, together with troops from Section \"B\" of the 6th Infantry Regiment, who had lost contact with his element. The units occupied positions in Sapper Hill, while the 3rd Artillery Group unloaded all its firepower on the British, which pressed the rearguard of the Argentine forces in retreat.\n\nAt 11:30 hours of the same day, the head of the Armored Cavalry Exploration Squadron 10 was ordered to place two sections of Panhard armored vehicles on the south-west boundary of Sapper Hill to give fire support to the retreat of the combat units.\n\nOn the other hand, some British helicopters overflew the Argentine infantry troops and, in these circumstances, the artillerymen of the 601 Antiaircraft Artillery Group opened fire, dispersing them. However, later, the Argentines were subjected to a precise and devastating artillery and mortar fire from the English positions that dominated the heights.\n\nAfter fighting bravely at Mount Longdon, the 7th Infantry Regiment retreated with part of the \"A\" and \"C\" companies to Wireless Ridge. On June 13, Argentine positions were beaten by heavy British artillery and mortar fire. The Regiment was practically cut off by radio interference and a cut of wire lines.\n\nThe British troops of the 2 Paratroopers, supported by light tanks, a platoon of machine guns and portable missile launchers of 3 British Paratroopers prepared for the final assault. As they moved forward, they found the 155-mm Argentinean cannon fire. Parachutists 2 attacked the first defensive lines of the \"7th Infantry\" and, at night, a deluge of fire from the naval artillery, mortars and phosphorus grenades, fell on the Argentines. One by one, the Argentine positions were eliminated.\n\nThe Battery of the Antiaircraft Defense Artillery Group 101 bombed with its 35 mm cannons. In turn, the \"A\" Company of the 3rd Infantry Regiment and the \"B\" Company of the 6th Infantry Regiment beat with mortar fire on Mount Longdon, a place where intense enemy fire arrived. In the light of the flares, the Armored Cavalry Exploration Squadron 10, which defended the western sector, fought hard against the \"D\" Company of 2 British Paratroopers.\n\nThe British had managed to evict the 7th Infantry Regiment from the height, so the Argentines had to retreat and regroup their punished troops high in the mountains. With the intention of destroying the battery of antiaircraft artillery, English commandos disembarked in Camber, but they were swept by the Argentine antiaircraft fire and had to retire quickly. Members of the companies of 601 and 602 of Commandos and the National Gendarmerie left for the Camber Peninsula to face the British, but they had already retired.\n\nThe 7th Regiment, by then, was on the verge of collapse. The 10th Armored Cavalry Exploration Squadron moved to reinforce it and, in those circumstances, collided with the English Blues and Royal, engaging both forces in a bitter struggle. The situation at Wireless Ridge stabilized and for hours there was multiple melee combat. The British could not advance. Members of the 6th and 25th Infantry Regiment left for Moody Brook to join the defense.\n\nAt dawn, the British unleashed the final attack: Company \"D\" of 2 Parachute advanced on the left flank of the 7th Infantry Regiment 7 and the 10th Exploration Squadron, subjecting them to a devastating encircling attack.\n\nThe \"A\" Company of the 3rd Infantry Regiment counterattacked on the western slope of the Wireless to allow the withdrawal of Argentine troops in that area. They crossed the Moody Creek and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with portable weapons and grenades against the English who already had almost all of Wireless Ridge in their possession.\n\nMeanwhile, the 10th Exploration Squadron was surrounded by the British army that was advancing throwing common grenades and phosphorus. The 1st Section of the Squadron was exterminated and the rest had to retreat, and the Argentines had withdrawn massively. At 07:00 on the morning of June 14, the fight was over.\n\nThe Argentine Army lost 194 men and much equipment. The war left the army weakened in equipment, personal, moral and supremacy in the region. The Dirty War events, coupled with the defeat in the Falklands War, precipitated the fall of the military junta that ruled the country, then enters the General Reynaldo Bignone, who began the process of return to democracy in 1983.\n\nSince the return to civilian rule in 1983, the Argentine military have been reduced both in number and budget and, by law, cannot intervene anymore in internal civil conflicts. They became more professional, especially after conscription was abolished.\n\nIn 1998, Argentina was granted Major non-NATO ally status by the United States. The modern Argentine Army is fully committed to international peacekeeping under United Nations mandates, humanitarian aid and emergencies relief.\n\nIn 2010, the Army incorporated Chinese Norinco armored wheeled APCs to deploy with its peacekeeping forces.\n\nIn 2016 President Mauricio Macri modified a decree made by the 1984 government of Raúl Alfonsín which had removed much of the military's autonomy.\n\nA major problem of today's Army is that most of its combat units are understrength in manpower due to budgetary limitations; the current Table of Organization and Equipment being established at a time during which the Army could rely on larger budgets and conscripted troops. Current plans call for the expansion of all combat units until all combat units are again full-strength, as soon as budget constraints allow for the induction of new volunteer service personnel of both genders.\n\nThe Army is headed by a Chief of General Staff directly appointed by the President. The current Chief of the General Staff (since September 2008) is General Luis Alberto Pozzi. The General Staff of the Army (\"Estado Mayor General del Ejército\") includes the Chief of Staff, a Deputy Chief of the General Staff and the heads of the General Staff's six departments (\"Jefaturas\"). The current departments of the General Staff (known also by their Roman numerals) are:\nThe General Staff also includes the General Inspectorate and the General Secretariat.\n\nThere are also a number of Commands and Directorates responsible for development and implementation of policies within the Army regarding technological and operational areas. They also handle administrative affairs. As of 2005, these include the following:\n\nIn the 1960s, the Army was reorganised into five Army Corps. This structure replaced the old structure based on divisions following the French model. There was a further reorganisation in 1991, when brigades were assigned to six new divisions, two stationed at Santa Cruz and Mendoza.\n\nUntil late 2010, the First, Second and Third Army Divisions were designated as the Second, Third and Fifth Army Corps (\"Cuerpos de Ejército\") respectively, without any intermediate division-level commands. These redesignations took place as part of a major reorganization of the Armed Forces' administrative and command structure. Two additional Army Corps, the First and Fourth, had already been dissolved in 1984 and 1991 respectively, with their dependent units reassigned to the remaining three Army Corps.\n\nAs of 2011, army forces are geographically grouped into three Army Divisions (\"Divisiones de Ejército\"), each roughly equivalent in terms of nominal organization to a U.S. Army division (+). Each Army Division has an area of responsibility over a specific region of the country; First Army Division covers the northeast of the country, Second Army Division covers the center and northwest of Argentina and Third Army Division covers the south and Patagonia. In addition to the three Army Divisions, the Rapid Deployment Force (\"Fuerza de Despliegue Rápido\", FDR) forms an additional fourth divisional-level formation, while the Buenos Aires Military Garrison operates independently from any division-sized command.\nThere are also several separate groups, including an anti-aircraft group and the Argentine Army Aviation group.\n\nEach division has varying numbers of brigades of armor, mechanized forces and infantry.\n\nAs of 2011, the Argentine Army has eleven brigades:\n\nNote: The 7th Infantry Brigade was dissolved in early 1985, while the 3rd Infantry Brigade was converted into a motorized training formation, which was ultimately dissolved in 2003.\n\nDepending on its type, each brigade includes two to five Cavalry or Infantry Regiments, one or two Artillery Groups, a scout cavalry squadron, one battalion or company-sized engineer unit, one intelligence company, one communications company, one command company and a battalion-sized logistical support unit. The terms \"regiment\" and \"group\", found in the official designations of cavalry, infantry and artillery units, are used due to historical reasons. During the Argentine War of Independence, the Argentine Army fielded traditional regiment-sized units. 'Regiments' are more accurately described as battalions; similar-sized units that do not belong to the above-mentioned services are referred to as \"battalions\". In addition to their service, Regiments and Groups are also specialized according to their area of operations (Mountain Infantry, Jungle Infantry, Mountain Cavalry), their equipment (Tank Cavalry, Light Cavalry, Mechanized Infantry) or their special training (Paratroopers, Commandos, Air Assault, Mountain Cazadores or Jungle Cazadores). Regiments are made up by four maneuver sub-units (companies in infantry regiments and squadrons in cavalry regiments) and one command and support sub-unit for a total of 350 to 700 troops.\n\nIn 2006, a Rapid Deployment Force was created based on the 4th Paratrooper Brigade.\n\nIn 2008, a Special Operations Forces Group was created comprising two Commando Companies, one Special Forces Company and one psychological operations company.\n\n\"See also\": Equipment of the Argentine Army\n\nInsignia for all ranks except Volunteers is worn on shoulder boards. Ranks from Colonel Major onwards use red-trimmed shoulderboards and the suns denoting rank are gold-braid; the suns on other officers' shoulder boards are metallic. Generals also wear golden wreath leaves on their coat lapels.\n\nThe rank insignia for Volunteers 1st Class, 2nd Class and Commissioned 2nd Class is worn on the sleeves. Collar versions of the ranks are used in combat uniforms.\n\nThe highest army rank in use is lieutenant-general. A higher army rank, captain-general, was awarded twice in the nineteenth century: to José de San Martín and to Bernardino Rivadavia. As a promotion to this rank is not foreseen, no insignia for the rank currently exists.\n\nThe rank of \"coronel mayor\" (senior colonel) is an honorary distinction for colonels occupying general's positions (such as brigade commander), but who are not senior enough to be promoted.\n\n\n\n"}

He helped to organize cultural life in Theresienstadt concentration camp.\n\nHans Krása was born in Prague, the son of Anna (Steiner) and Karl Krasa, a lawyer. His father was a Czech Jew and his mother was German Jewish. He studied both the piano and violin as a child and went on to study composition at the German Music Academy in Prague. After graduating, he went on to become a répétiteur at the Neues Deutsches Theater, where he met the composer and conductor Alexander von Zemlinsky, who had a major influence on Krása's career.\n\nIn 1927 he followed Zemlinsky to Berlin, where he was introduced to Albert Roussel. Krása, whose primary influences were Mahler, Schoenberg and Zemlinsky, also felt an affinity with French music, especially the group of composers known as \"Les Six\" and made a number of trips to France to study under Roussel while he lived in Berlin. Krása eventually returned, homesick, to Prague to resume his old job as a répétiteur at the Neues Deutsches Theater. His debut as a composer came with his \"Four Orchestral Songs\" Op. 1, based on the \"Galgenlieder\" (Gallows Songs) of Christian Morgenstern. The work was first performed under Zemlinsky's direction in Prague in May 1921 and was widely acclaimed. There followed a string quartet, a set of five songs for voice and piano and his \"Symphonie für kleines Orchester\", which was performed in Zurich, Paris and Boston. His major achievement, however, was the opera \"Verlobung im Traum\" (\"Betrothal in a Dream\") after the novel \"Uncle's Dream\" by Dostoyevsky. This work was first performed at the Neues Deutsches Theater in Prague in 1933 under Georg Szell and was awarded the Czechoslovak State Prize. \n\n\"Brundibár\", a children's opera based on a play by Aristophanes, was the last work Krása completed before he was arrested by the Nazis on 10 August 1942. Krása was sent to the Theresienstadt ghetto where he reworked \"Brundibár\" with the available cast “and scattered salt of staging”, who then performed it 55 times in the camp, with excerpts featured in the infamous propaganda film made for the Red Cross in 1944. While he was interned in the ghetto, Krása was at his most productive, producing a number of chamber works although, due to the circumstances, some of these have not survived.\n\nAlong with fellow composers Viktor Ullmann, Pavel Haas and Gideon Klein, Krása was taken to Auschwitz.

{"id": "2025792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2025792", "title": "Music education", "text": "Music education\n\nMusic education is a field of practice, in which educators are trained for careers as elementary or secondary music teachers, school or music conservatory ensemble directors. As well, music education is a research area in which scholars do original research on ways of teaching and learning music. Music education scholars publish their findings in peer-reviewed journals, and teach undergraduate and graduate education students at university education or music schools, who are training to become music teachers.\n\nMusic education touches on all learning domains, including the psychomotor domain (the development of skills), the cognitive domain (the acquisition of knowledge), and, in particular and the affective domain (the learner's willingness to receive, internalize, and share what is learned), including music appreciation and sensitivity. Many music education curriculums incorporate the usage of mathematical skills as well fluid usage and understanding of a secondary language or culture. The consistency of practicing these skills has been shown to benefit students in a multitude of other academic areas as well as improving performance on standardized tests such as the ACT and SAT. Music training from preschool through post-secondary education is common because involvement with music is considered a fundamental component of human culture and behavior. Cultures from around the world have different approaches to music education, largely due to the varying histories and politics. Studies show that teaching music from other cultures can help students perceive unfamiliar sounds more comfortably, and they also show that musical preference is related to the language spoken by the listener and the other sounds they are exposed to within their own culture.\n\nDuring the 20th century, many distinctive approaches were developed or further refined for the teaching of music, some of which have had widespread impact. The Dalcroze method (eurhythmics) was developed in the early 20th century by Swiss musician and educator Émile Jaques-Dalcroze. The Kodály Method emphasizes the benefits of physical instruction and response to music. The Orff Schulwerk approach to music education leads students to develop their music abilities in a way that parallels the development of western music.\n\nThe Suzuki method creates the same environment for learning music that a person has for learning their native language. Gordon Music Learning Theory provides the music teacher with a method for teaching musicianship through \"audiation\", Gordon's term for hearing music in the mind \"with understanding\". Conversational Solfège immerses students in the musical literature of their own culture, in this case American. The Carabo-Cone Method involves using props, costumes, and toys for children to learn basic musical concepts of staff, note duration, and the piano keyboard. The concrete environment of the specially planned classroom allows the child to learn the fundamentals of music by exploring through touch. The MMCP (Manhattanville Music Curriculum Project) aims to shape attitudes, helping students see music as personal, current, and evolving. Popular music pedagogy is the systematic teaching and learning of rock music and other forms of popular music both inside and outside formal classroom settings. Some have suggested that certain musical activities can help to improve breath, body and voice control of a child.\n\nIn primary schools in European countries, children often learn to play instruments such as keyboards or recorders, sing in small choirs, and learn about the elements of music and history of music. In countries such as India, the harmonium is used in schools, but instruments like keyboards and violin are also common. Students are normally taught basics of Indian Raga music. In primary and secondary schools, students may often have the opportunity to perform in some type of musical ensemble, such as a choir, orchestra, or school band: concert band, marching band, or jazz band. In some secondary schools, additional music classes may also be available. In junior high school or its equivalent, music usually continues to be a required part of the curriculum.\n\nAt the university level, students in most arts and humanities programs receive academic credit for music courses such as music history, typically of Western art music, or music appreciation, which focuses on listening and learning about different musical styles. In addition, most North American and European universities offer music ensembles – such as choir, concert band, marching band, or orchestra – that are open to students from various fields of study. Most universities also offer degree programs in music education, certifying students as primary and secondary music educators. Advanced degrees such as the D.M.A. or the Ph.D can lead to university employment. These degrees are awarded upon completion of music theory, music history, technique classes, private instruction with a specific instrument, ensemble participation, and in depth observations of experienced educators. Music education departments in North American and European universities also support interdisciplinary research in such areas as music psychology, music education historiography, educational ethnomusicology, sociomusicology, and philosophy of education.\n\nThe study of western art music is increasingly common in music education outside of North America and Europe, including Asian nations such as South Korea, Japan, and China. At the same time, Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of outside the Western art music canon, including music of West Africa, of Indonesia (e.g. Gamelan music), Mexico (e.g., mariachi music), Zimbabwe (marimba music), as well as popular music.\n\nMusic education also takes place in individualized, lifelong learning, and in community contexts. Both amateur and professional musicians typically take music lessons, short private sessions with an individual teacher.\n\nWhile instructional strategies are determined by the music teacher and the music curriculum in his or her area, many teachers rely heavily on one of many instructional methodologies that emerged in recent generations and developed rapidly during the latter half of the 20th Century.\n\nThe Dalcroze method was developed in the early 20th century by Swiss musician and educator Émile Jaques-Dalcroze. The method is divided into three fundamental concepts − the use of solfège, improvisation, and eurhythmics. Sometimes referred to as \"rhythmic gymnastics,\" eurhythmics teaches concepts of rhythm, structure, and musical expression using movement, and is the concept for which Dalcroze is best known. It focuses on allowing the student to gain physical awareness and experience of music through training that engages all of the senses, particularly kinesthetic. According to the Dalcroze method, music is the fundamental language of the human brain and therefore deeply connected to who we are. American proponents of the Dalcroze method include Ruth Alperson, Ann Farber, Herb Henke, Virginia Mead, Lisa Parker, Martha Sanchez, and Julia Schnebly-Black. Many active teachers of Dalcroze method were trained by Dr. Hilda Schuster who was one of the students of Dalcroze.\n\nZoltán Kodály (1882–1967) was a prominent Hungarian music educator and composer who stressed the benefits of physical instruction and response to music. Although not really an educational method, his teachings reside within a fun, educational framework built on a solid grasp of basic music theory and music notation in various verbal and written forms. Kodály's primary goal was to instill a lifelong love of music in his students and felt that it was the duty of the child's school to provide this vital element of education. Some of Kodály's trademark teaching methods include the use of solfège hand signs, musical shorthand notation (stick notation), and rhythm solmization (verbalization). Most countries have used their own folk music traditions to construct their own instruction sequence, but the United States primarily uses the Hungarian sequence. The work of Denise Bacon, Katinka S. Daniel, John Feierabend, Jean Sinor, Jill Trinka, and others brought Kodaly's ideas to the forefront of music education in the United States.\n\nCarl Orff was a prominent German composer. Orff Schulwerk is considered an \"approach\" to music education. It begins with a student's innate abilities to engage in rudimentary forms of music, using basic rhythms and melodies. Orff considers the whole body a percussive instrument and students are led to develop their music abilities in a way that parallels the development of western music. The approach fosters student self-discovery, encourages improvisation, and discourages adult pressures and mechanical drill. Carl Orff developed a special group of instruments, including modifications of the glockenspiel, xylophone, metallophone, drum, and other percussion instruments to accommodate the requirements of the Schulwerk courses. Experts in shaping an American-style Orff approach include Jane Frazee, Arvida Steen, and Judith Thomas.\n\nThe Suzuki method was developed by Shinichi Suzuki in Japan shortly after World War II, and uses music education to enrich the lives and moral character of its students. The movement rests on the double premise that \"all children can be well educated\" in music, and that learning to play music at a high level also involves learning certain character traits or virtues which make a person's soul more beautiful. The primary method for achieving this is centered around creating the same environment for learning music that a person has for learning their native language. This 'ideal' environment includes love, high-quality examples, praise, rote training and repetition, and a time-table set by the student's developmental readiness for learning a particular technique. While the Suzuki Method is quite popular internationally, within Japan its influence is less significant than the Yamaha Method, founded by Genichi Kawakami in association with the Yamaha Music Foundation.\n\nIn addition to the four major international methods described above, other approaches have been influential. Lesser-known methods are described below:\n\nEdwin Gordon's music learning theory is based on an extensive body of research and field testing by Edwin E. Gordon and others in the larger field of music learning theory. It provides music teachers with a comprehensive framework for teaching musicianship through audiation, Gordon's term for hearing music in the mind with understanding and comprehension when the sound is not physically present. The sequence of instructions is discrimination learning and inference learning. Discrimination Learning, the ability to determine whether two elements are the same or not the same using aural/oral, verbal association, partial synthesis, symbolic association, and composite synthesis. With inference learning, students take an active role in their own education and learn to identify, create, and improvise unfamiliar patterns. The skills and content sequences within the audiation theory help music teachers establish sequential curricular objectives in accord with their own teaching styles and beliefs. There also is a learning theory for newborns and young children in which the types and stages of preparatory audiation are outlined.\n\nThe growth of cultural diversity within school-age populations prompted music educators from the 1960s onward to diversify the music curriculum, and to work with ethnomusicologists and artist-musicians to establish instructional practices rooted in musical traditions. 'World music pedagogy' was coined by Patricia Shehan Campbell to describe world music content and practice in elementary and secondary school music programs. Pioneers of the movement, especially Barbara Reeder Lundquist, William M. Anderson, and Will Schmid, influenced a second generation of music educators (including J. Bryan Burton, Mary Goetze, Ellen McCullough-Brabson, and Mary Shamrock) to design and deliver curricular models to music teachers of various levels and specializations. The pedagogy advocates the use of human resources, i.e., \"culture-bearers,\" as well as deep and continued listening to archived resources such as those of Smithsonian Folkways Recordings.\n\nInfluenced by both the Kodály method and Gordon's Music Learning Theory, Conversational Solfège was developed by Dr. John M. Feierabend, former chair of music education at the Hartt School, University of Hartford. The program begins by immersing students in the musical literature of their own culture, in this case American. Music is seen as separate from, and more fundamental than, notation. In twelve learning stages, students move from hearing and singing music to decoding and then creating music using spoken syllables and then standard written notation. Rather than implementing the Kodály method directly, this method follows Kodály's original instructions and builds on America's own folk songs instead of on Hungarian folk songs.\n\nThis early-childhood approach, sometimes referred to as the sensory-motor approach to music, was developed by the violinist Madeleine Carabo-Cone. This approach involves using props, costumes, and toys for children to learn basic musical concepts of staff, note duration, and the piano keyboard. The concrete environment of the specially planned classroom allows the child to learn the fundamentals of music by exploring through touch.\n\n'Popular music pedagogy' — alternatively called rock music pedagogy, modern band, popular music education, or rock music education — is a 1960s development in music education consisting of the systematic teaching and learning of rock music and other forms of popular music both inside and outside formal classroom settings. Popular music pedagogy tends to emphasize group improvisation, and is more commonly associated with community music activities than fully institutionalized school music ensembles.\n\nThe Manhattanville Music Curriculum Project was developed in 1965 as a response to declining student interest in school music. This creative approach aims to shape attitudes, helping students see music not as static content to be mastered, but as personal, current, and evolving. Rather than imparting factual knowledge, this method centers around the student, who learns through investigation, experimentation, and discovery. The teacher gives a group of students a specific problem to solve together and allows freedom to create, perform, improvise, conduct, research, and investigate different facets of music in a spiral curriculum. MMCP is viewed as the forerunner to projects in creative music composition and improvisation activities in schools.\n\nAfter the preaching of Reverend Thomas Symmes, the first singing school was created in 1717 in Boston for the purposes of improving singing and music reading in the church. These singing schools gradually spread throughout the colonies. Music education continued to flourish with the creation of the Academy of Music in Boston. Reverend John Tufts published \"An Introduction to the Singing of Psalm Tunes Using Non-Traditional Notation\" which is regarded as the first music textbook in the colonies. Between 1700 and 1820, more than 375 tune books would be published by such authors as Samuel Holyoke, Francis Hopkinson, William Billings, and Oliver Holden.\n\nMusic began to spread as a curricular subject into other school districts. Soon after music expanded to all grade levels and the teaching of music reading was improved until the music curriculum grew to include several activities in addition to music reading. By the end of 1864 public school music had spread throughout the country.\n\nIn 1832, Lowell Mason and George Webb formed the Boston Academy of Music with the purposes of teaching singing and theory as well as methods of teaching music. Mason published his \"Manuel of Instruction\" in 1834 which was based upon the music education works of Pestalozzian System of Education founded by Swiss educator Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. This handbook gradually became used by many singing school teachers. From 1837–1838, the Boston School Committee allowed Lowell Mason to teach music in the Hawes School as a demonstration. This is regarded as the first time music education was introduced to public schools in the United States. In 1838 the Boston School Committee approved the inclusion of music in the curriculum and Lowell Mason became the first recognized supervisor of elementary music. In later years Luther Whiting Mason became the Supervisor of Music in Boston and spread music education into all levels of public education (grammar, primary, and high school). \n\nDuring the middle of the 19th century, Boston became the model to which many other cities across the United States included and shaped their public school music education programs. Music methodology for teachers as a course was first introduced in the Normal School in Potsdam. The concept of classroom teachers in a school that taught music under the direction of a music supervisor was the standard model for public school music education during this century. (See also: \"Music education in the United States\") While women were discouraged from composing in the 19th century, \"later, it was accepted that women would have a role in music education, and they became involved in this field...to such a degree that women dominated music education during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century.\"\n\nIn the United States, teaching colleges with four-year degree programs developed from the Normal Schools and included music. Oberlin Conservatory first offered the Bachelor of Music Education degree. Osbourne G. McCarthy, an American music educator, introduced details for studying music for credit in Chelsea High School. Notable events in the history of music education in the early 20th century also include:\n\nThe following table illustrates some notable developments from this period:\n\nMusic course offerings and even entire degree programs in online music education developed in the first decade of the 21st century at various institutions, and the fields of world music pedagogy and popular music pedagogy have also seen notable expansion.\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries, social aspects of teaching and learning music came to the fore. This emerged as praxial music education, critical theory, and feminist theory. Of importance are the colloquia and journals of the MayDay Group, \"an international think tank of music educators that aims to identify, critique, and change taken-for-granted patterns of professional activity, polemical approaches to method and philosophy, and educational politics and public pressures that threaten effective practice and critical communication in music education.\" With a new focus on social aspects of music education, scholars have analyzed critical aspects such as music and race, gender, class, institutional belonging, and sustainability.\n\nInstitutional music education was started in colonial India by Rabindranath Tagore after he founded the Visva-Bharati University. At present, most universities have a faculty of music with some universities specially dedicated to fine arts such as Indira Kala Sangeet University, Swathi Thirunal College of Music or Rabindra Bharati University.Indian classical music is based on the Guru-Shishya parampara system. The teacher, known as Guru, transmit the musical knowledge to the student, or shyshya. This is still the main system used in India to transmit musical knowledge. Although European art music became popularized in schools throughout much of the world during the twentieth century (East Asia, Latin America, Oceania, Africa), India remains one of the few highly populated nations in which non-European indigenous music traditions have consistently received relatively greater emphasis. That said, there is certainly much western influence in the popular music associated with Bollywood film scores.\n\nThe Indonesian island of Java is known for its rich musical culture, centered around gamelan music. The two oldest gamelan instrument sets, dating from the twelfth century, are housed in the kratons (palaces) in the cities of Yogyakarta and Surakarta. Gamelan music is an integral part of the Javanese culture: it is a part of religious ceremonies, weddings, funerals, palace activities, national holidays, and local community gatherings. In recent years, there has been an increasing market for gamelan associated tourism: several companies arrange visits for tourists wishing to participate in and learn gamelan.\n\nGamelan music has a distinct pedagogical approach. The term \"maguru panggul\", translated means “teaching with the mallet” describes the master-apprentice approach that is used most often when teaching the music. The teacher demonstrates long passages of music at a time, without stopping to have the student demonstrate comprehension of the passage, as in a western music pedagogy. A teacher and student will frequently sit on opposite sides of a drum or mallet instrument, so that both can play it. This provides the teacher an easy way to demonstrate, and the student can study and mimic the teacher's actions. The teacher trains the kendang player, who is the leader of the ensemble. The teacher works one on one with them and repeats the parts as many times as necessary until the piece is rhythmically and stylistically accurate. The Kendang player is sometimes relied on to transmit the music to their fellow gamelan members.\n\nThe South African Department of Education and the ILAM Music Heritage Project SA teach African music using western musical framework. ILAM's \"Listen and Learn\" for students 11–14 is \"unique\" in teaching curriculum requirements for western music using recordings of traditional African music.\n\nFrom the time that Africa was colonized up to 1994, indigenous music and arts being taught in schools was a rare occurrence. The African National Congress (ANC) attempted to repair the neglect of indigenous knowledge and the overwhelming emphasis on written musical literacy in schools. It is not well known that the learning of indigenous music actually has a philosophy and teaching procedure that is different from western “formal” training. It involves the whole community because indigenous songs are about the history of its people. After the colonization of Africa, music became more centered on Christian beliefs and European folk songs, rather than the more improvised and fluid indigenous music. Before the major changes education went through from 1994 to 2004, during the first decade of the democratic government, teachers were trained as classroom teachers and told that they would have to incorporate music into other subject areas. The few colleges with teaching programs that included instrumental programs held a greater emphasis on music theory, history of western music, western music notation, and less on making music. Up until 1999, most college syllabi did not include training in indigenous South African Music.\n\nIn African cultures music is seen as a community experience and is used for social and religious occasions. As soon as children show some sign of being able to handle music or a musical instrument they are allowed to participate with the adults of the community in musical events. Traditional songs are more important to many people because they are stories about the histories of the indigenous peoples.\n\nAmong the Aztecs, Mayans, and Incas, music was used in ceremonies and rituals to teach the history of their civilizations and was also used for worship. The Aztec people were mainly educated by their priests. Music remained an important way to teach religion and history and was taught by priests for many centuries. When Spain and Portugal colonized parts of South America, music started to be influenced by European ideas and qualities. Several priests of European descent, such as Antonio Sepp, taught European systems of music notation and theory based on their knowledge of playing instruments throughout the 1700-1800s. Since music was taught to the general public by rote, very few knew how to read music other than those who played instruments until the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The development of music in South America mainly followed that of European development. Choirs were formed to sing masses, chants, psalms, but secular music also became more prevalent in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and beyond.\n\nMusic education in Latin America today has large emphasis on folk music, masses, and orchestral music. Many classrooms teach their choirs to sing in their native language as well as in English. Several Latin American Schools, specifically in Puerto Rico and Haiti, believe music to be an important subject and are working on expanding their programs. Outside of school, many communities form their own musical groups and organizations. Community performances are very popular with the local audiences. There are a few well-known Latin American choral groups, such as \"El Coro de Madrigalistas\" from Mexico. This famous choral group tours around Mexico, showing students around the country what a professional choral ensemble sounds like.\n\nThere is evidence of the positive impact of participation in youth orchestras and academic achievement and resilience in Chile. \nThe music, languages, and sounds we are exposed to within our own cultures determine our tastes in music and affect the way we perceive the music of other cultures. Many studies have shown distinct differences in the preferences and abilities of musicians from around the world. One study attempted to view the distinctions between the musical preferences of English and Japanese speakers, providing both groups of people with the same series of tones and rhythms. The same type of study was done for English and French speakers. Both studies suggested that the language spoken by the listener determined which groupings of tones and rhythms were more appealing, based on the inflections and natural rhythm groupings of their language.\n\nAnother study had Europeans and Africans try to tap along with certain rhythms. European rhythms are regular and built on simple ratios, while African rhythms are typically based on irregular ratios. While both groups of people could perform the rhythms with European qualities, the European group struggled with the African rhythms. This has to do with the ubiquity of complex polyrhythm in African culture and their familiarity with this type of sound.\n\nWhile each culture has its own musical qualities and appeals, incorporating cross-cultural curricula in our music classrooms can help teach students how to better perceive music from other cultures. Studies show that learning to sing folk songs or popular music of other cultures is an effective way to understand a culture as opposed to merely learning about it. If music classrooms discuss the musical qualities and incorporate styles from other cultures, such as the Brazilian roots of the Bossa Nova, the Afro-Cuban clave, and African drumming, it will expose students to new sounds and teach them how to compare their cultures’ music to the different music and start to make them more comfortable with exploring sounds.\n\nAchievement standards are curricular statements used to guide educators in determining objectives for their teaching. Use of standards became a common practice in many nations during the 20th century. For much of its existence, the curriculum for music education in the United States was determined locally or by individual teachers. In recent decades there has been a significant move toward adoption of regional and/or national standards. , created nine voluntary content standards, called the \"National Standards for Music Education\". These standards call for:\n\nMany states and school districts have adopted their own standards for music education.\n\nSome schools and organizations promote integration of arts classes, such as music, with other subjects, such as math, science, or English, believing that integrating the different curricula will help each subject to build off of one another, enhancing the overall quality of education.\n\nOne example is the Kennedy Center's \"Changing Education Through the Arts\" program. CETA defines arts integration as finding a natural connection(s) between one or more art forms (dance, drama/theater, music, visual arts, storytelling, puppetry, and/or creative writing) and one or more other curricular areas (science, social studies, English language arts, mathematics, and others) in order to teach and assess objectives in both the art form and the other subject area. This allows a simultaneous focus on creating, performing, and/or responding to the arts while still addressing content in other subject areas.\n\nThe European Union Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013 has funded three projects that use music to support language learning. Lullabies of Europe (for pre-school and early learners), FolkDC (for primary), and the recent PopuLLar (for secondary). In addition, the ARTinED project is also using music for all subject areas.\n\nA number of researchers and music education advocates have argued that studying music enhances academic achievement, such as William Earhart, former president of the Music Educators National Conference, who claimed that \"Music enhances knowledge in the areas of mathematics, science, geography, history, foreign language, physical education, and vocational training.\" Researchers at the University of Wisconsin suggested that students with piano or keyboard experience performed 34% higher on tests that measure spatial-temporal lobe activity, which is the part of the brain that is used when doing mathematics, science, and engineering.\n\nAn experiment by Wanda T. Wallace setting text to melody suggested that some music may aid in text recall. She created a three verse song with a non-repetitive melody; each verse with different music. A second experiment created a three verse song with a repetitive melody; each verse had exactly the same music. A third experiment studied text recall without music. She found the repetitive music produced the highest amount of text recall, suggesting music can serve as a mnemonic device.\n\nSmith (1985) studied background music with word lists. One experiment involved memorizing a word list with background music; participants recalled the words 48 hours later. Another experiment involved memorizing a word list with no background music; participants also recalled the words 48 hours later. Participants who memorized word lists with background music recalled more words demonstrating music provides contextual cues.\n\nCiting studies that support music education's involvement in intellectual development and academic achievement, the United States Congress passed a resolution declaring that: \"Music education enhances intellectual development and enriches the academic environment for children of all ages; and Music educators greatly contribute to the artistic, intellectual and social development of American children and play a key role in helping children to succeed in school.\"\n\nBobbett (1990) suggests that most public school music programs have not changed since their inception at the turn of the last century. \"…the educational climate is not conducive to their continuance as historically conceived and the social needs and habits of people require a completely different kind of band program.\" A 2011 study conducted by Kathleen M. Kerstetter for the Journal of Band Research found that increased non-musical graduation requirements, block scheduling, increased number of non-traditional programs such as magnet schools, and the testing emphases created by the No Child Left Behind Act are only some of the concerns facing music educators. Both teachers and students are under increased time restrictions\"\n\nDr. Patricia Powers states, \"It is not unusual to see program cuts in the area of music and arts when economic issues surface. It is indeed unfortunate to lose support in this area especially since music and the art programs contribute to society in many positive ways.\" Comprehensive music education programs average $187 per pupil, according to a 2011 study funded by the national Association of Music Merchants (NAMM) Foundation The Texas Commission on Drugs and Alcohol Abuse Report noted that students who participated in band or orchestra reported the lowest lifetime and current use of all substances including alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs.\n\nStudies have shown that music education can be used to enhance cognitive achievement in students. In the United States an estimated 30% of students struggle with reading, while 17% are reported as having a specific learning disability linked to reading. Using intensive music curriculum as an intervention paired alongside regular classroom activities, research shows that students involved with the music curriculum show increases in reading comprehension, word knowledge, vocabulary recall, and word decoding. When a student is singing a melody with text, they are using multiple areas of their brain to multitask. Music effects language development, increases IQ, spatial-temporal skills, and improves test scores. Music education has also shown to improve the skills of dyslexic children in similar areas as mentioned earlier by focusing on visual auditory and fine motor skills as strategies to combat their disability. Since research in this area is sparse, we cannot convincingly conclude these findings to be true, however the results from research done do show a positive impact on both students with learning difficulties and those who are not diagnosed. Further research will need to be done, but the positive engaging way of bringing music into the classroom cannot be forgotten, and the students generally show a positive reaction to this form of instruction.\n\nMusic education has also been noted to have the ability to increase someones overall IQ, especially in children during peak development years. Spatial ability, verbal memory, reading and mathematic ability are seen to be increased alongside music education (primarily through the learning of an instrument). Researchers also note that a correlation between general attendance and IQ increases is evident, and due to students involvement in music education, general attendance rates increase along with their IQ.\n\nFine motor skills, social behaviours, and emotional well being can also be increased through music and music education. The learning of an instrument increases fine motor skills in students with physical disabilities. Emotional well being can be increased as students find meaning in songs and connect them to their everyday life. Through social interactions of playing in groups like jazz and concert bands, students learn to socialize and this can be linked to emotional and mental well being.\n\nThere is evidence of positive impacts of participation in youth orchestras and academic achievement and resilience in Chile. \n\nIn some communities – and even entire national education systems – music is provided little support as an academic subject area, and music teachers feel that they must actively seek greater public endorsement for music education as a legitimate subject of study. This perceived need to change public opinion has resulted in the development of a variety of approaches commonly called \"music advocacy\". Music advocacy comes in many forms, some of which are based upon legitimate scholarly arguments and scientific findings, while other examples controversially rely on emotion, anecdotes, or unconvincing data.\n\nRecent high-profile music advocacy projects include the \"Mozart Effect\", the National Anthem Project, and the movement in World Music Pedagogy (also known as Cultural Diversity in Music Education) which seeks out means of equitable pedagogy across students regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic circumstance. The Mozart effect is particularly controversial as while the initial study suggested listening to Mozart positively impacts spatial-temporal reasoning, later studies either failed to replicate the results, suggested no effect on IQ or spatial ability, or suggested the music of Mozart could be substituted for any music children enjoy in a term called \"enjoyment arousal.\" Another study suggested that even if listening to Mozart may temporarily enhance a student's spatial-temporal abilities, learning to play an instrument is much more likely to improve student performance and achievement. Educators similarly criticized the National Anthem Project not only for promoting the educational use of music as a tool for non-musical goals, but also for its links to nationalism and militarism.\n\nContemporary music scholars assert that effective music advocacy uses empirically sound arguments that transcend political motivations and personal agendas. Music education philosophers such as Bennett Reimer, Estelle Jorgensen, David J. Elliott, John Paynter, and Keith Swanwick support this view, yet many music teachers and music organizations and schools do not apply this line of reasoning into their music advocacy arguments. Researchers such as Ellen Winner conclude that arts advocates have made bogus claims to the detriment of defending the study of music, her research debunking claims that music education improves math, for example. Researchers Glenn Schellenberg and Eugenia Costa-Giomi also criticize advocates incorrectly associating correlation with causation, Giomi pointing out that while there is a \"strong relationship between music participation and academic achievement, the \"causal\" nature of the relationship is questionable.\" Philosophers David Elliott and Marissa Silverman suggest that more effective advocacy involves shying away from \"dumbing down\" values and aims through slogans and misleading data, energy being better focused into engaging potential supporters in active music-making and musical-affective experiences, these actions recognizing that music and music-making are inherent to human culture and behavior, distinguishing humans from other species.\n\nWhile music critics argued in the 1880s that \"...women [composers] lacked the innate creativity to compose good music\" due to \"biological predisposition\", later, it was accepted that women would have a role in music education, and they became involved in this field \"...to such a degree that women dominated music education during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century.\"\"Traditional accounts of the history of music education [in the US] have often neglected the contributions of women, because these texts have emphasized bands and the top leaders in hierarchical music organizations.\" When looking beyond these bandleaders and top leaders, women had many music education roles in the \"...home, community, churches, public schools, and teacher-training institutions\" and \"...as writers, patrons, and through their volunteer work in organizations.\" \n\nDespite the limitations imposed on women's roles in music education in the 19th century, women were accepted as kindergarten teachers, because this was deemed to be a \"private sphere\". Women also taught music privately, in girl's schools, Sunday schools, and they trained musicians in school music programs. By the turn of the 20th century, women began to be employed as music supervisors in elementary schools, teachers in normal schools and professors of music in universities. Women also became more active in professional organizations in music education, and women presented papers at conferences. A woman, Frances Clarke (1860-1958) founded the Music Supervisors National Conference in 1907. While a small number of women served as President of the Music Supervisors National Conference (and the following renamed versions of the organization over the next century) in the early 20th century, there were only two female Presidents between 1952 and 1992, which \"[p]ossibly reflects discrimination.\"\n\nAfter 1990, however, leadership roles for women in the organization opened up. From 1990 to 2010, there were five female Presidents of this organization. Women music educators \"outnumber men two-to-one\" in teaching general music, choir, private lessons, and keyboard instruction . More men tend to be hired as for band education, administration and jazz jobs, and more men work in colleges and universities. According to Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe, there is still a \"glass ceiling\" for women in music education careers, as there is \"stigma\" associated with women in leadership positions and \"men outnumber women as administrators.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

C. Aspinwall, granddaughter of Admiral Foote; and commissioned 22 December 1942, Commander Bernard L. Austin in command.\n\nIn April \"Foote\" received a new skipper, CDR Alston Ramsay. \nAfter escorting a convoy to Casablanca between 1 April and 9 May, \"Foote\" prepared for Pacific duty, and on 28 June arrived at Nouméa, New Caledonia, to join Destroyer Squadron 23. Through the next 3 months, she escorted convoys from Nouméa to Guadalcanal, Efate, Espiritu Santo, Vella Lavella, and Rendova. From 27–29 September, she hunted Japanese barges evacuating troops from Kolombangara, and on the last night, attacked such a group, probably sinking two. While was working to correct steering trouble that night, \"Foote\" drove off a lone Japanese aircraft, then stood by \"McCalla\" and after the two collided, until a tug arrived on the scene.\n\nPutting into Vella Lavella on 1 October with an LST convoy which she had joined at sea, \"Foote\" joined in fighting off an enemy air attack later that day, splashing at least one plane. She escorted the LSTs back to Guadalcanal, returning to convoy duty until\ncovering the landings on the Treasury Islands on 26–27 October. She put out from Purvis Bay on 31 October to bombard Buka Island and the Shortlands, neutralizing enemy airfields to prevent air opposition to the Bougainville landings. Alerted to the movement of an enemy task force, \"Foote\" made contact by radar in the early morning of 2 November, and in the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay which followed, she was hit by an enemy torpedo which blew off her stern, as the other ships of her division launched the torpedo attacks which helped sink two Japanese ships and turned back the planned assault by the Japanese task force on the shipping off Bougainville. With 19 killed and 17 wounded, \"Foote\"s men kept their ship afloat despite the fact that both engines were stopped, steering control lost and the main deck awash aft. They also manned their guns to splash at least one wave of Japanese planes which attacked the American ships the next morning. She was towed into Purvis Bay on 4 November for repairs.\n\nReturning to San Pedro, California on 4 March, towed by , \"Foote\" was repaired and modernized. Between 6 August and 24 October, she served as a training ship for precommissioning crews of new destroyers, sailing out of San Francisco. Bound for action once more, she crossed the Pacific to Kossol Roads, where she arrived 13 November to join the screen of an aircraft carrier force providing air cover for convoys from Manus Island reinforcing troops at Leyte. \"Foote\" replenished at Manus from 27 November to 9 December, then sailed for Leyte, arriving 13 December.\n\n\"Foote\" put to sea on 19 December to guard a convoy to Mindoro, which was attacked several times by \"kamikazes\". The destroyer splashed at least one of these, as well as rescuing survivors from two LSTs which were hit. Returning to Leyte on 24 December, she prepared for the Lingayen invasion, for which she sailed screening amphibious forces on 4 January 1945. Before the landings of 9 January, she fired in several enemy air attacks, and bombarded the beaches. After a fast voyage to Leyte to escort a resupply convoy, \"Foote\" took up screening and patrol duty in Lingayen Gulf until returning to Leyte 31 March.\n\nThe destroyer had escort and training duty between Leyte, Manus, and Morotai through 13 May 1945, when she got underway from Leyte for picket duty off Okinawa. During the numerous enemy air attacks while she was on station, she was credited with knocking down at least one plane, and suffered two men wounded from the effect of a near miss on 24 May. She took part in the landings of 3–6 June at Iheya Shima, and those of 9 June at Aguni Shima, and patrolled off Okinawa until sailing 10 September for the east coast of the United States. Arriving at New York 17 October 1945, \"Foote\" was decommissioned on 18 April 1946.\n\n\"Foote\" was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register 1 October 1972; she was sold 2 January 1974 and broken up for scrap.\n\n\"Foote\" received four battle stars for World War II service.\n\n"}

He now teaches at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nHis book, \"Shadowed Lives: Undocumented Immigrants in American Society\" (Wadsworth Publishing, 1998), which provides an ethnographic account of Mexican and Central American illegal immigrants in San Diego County, California, is widely used in cultural anthropology courses throughout the United States.\n\nHis book \"Covering Immigration: Popular Images and the Politics of the Nation\" (UC Press, 2001) examines media representations of immigrations and the nation. This provocative book gives a cultural history of the immigration issue in the United States since 1965, using popular magazine covers as a fascinating entry into a discussion of our attitudes toward one of the most volatile debates in the nation. Leo Chavez gathers and analyzes over seventy cover images from politically diverse magazines, including \"Time\", \"Newsweek\", \"U.S. News & World Report\", \"Business Week\", \"The New Republic\", \"The Nation\", and \"American Heritage\". He traces the connections between the social, legal, and economic conditions surrounding immigration and the diverse images through which it is portrayed. Covering Immigration suggests that media images not only reflect the national mood but also play a powerful role in shaping national discourse. Drawing on insights from anthropology, sociology, and cultural studies, this original and perceptive book raises new questions about the media's influence over the public's increasing fear of immigration.\n\nHis recent book \"The Latino Threat: Constructing Immigrants, Citizens, and the Nation\" (Stanford University Press, 2008) examines the role of media spectacles in helping shape how Latinos are constructed as a threat to the nation and for undermining claims of citizenship. Specific sites of contestation over citizenship and belonging are also examined, such as organ transplants for immigrants, the Minuteman Project's spectacle of surveillance along the Arizona-Mexico border, and the marches for immigrant rights of 2006.\n\nChavez is currently a Professor of Anthropology at University of California, Irvine, where he teaches undergraduate and graduate courses on immigration, international migration, culture and visual images, and medical anthropology.\n\nChavez's research interests include international migration; household and family organization, composition, and structure; medical anthropology; breast and cervical cancer among Latinas; the anthropology of power relations; and, more recently, the analysis of visual images related to immigration and the nation.\n"}

She is best known for her work on comic book titles such as \"Power Pack\", \"X-Factor\", \"New Mutants\", \"\", and \"Steel\". She is often referred to by the nickname \"Weezie\". Among the comic characters she co-created are Cable, Steel, Power Pack, Rictor, Doomsday and the X-Men villain Apocalypse.\n\nIn recognition of her contributions to comics, Comics Alliance listed Simonson as one of twelve women cartoonists deserving of lifetime achievement recognition.\n\nIn 1964 while attending Georgia State College, Louise met fellow student Jeff Jones. The two began dating and were married in 1966. Their daughter Julianna was born the following year. After graduation, the couple moved to New York City. Louise modeled for artist Bernie Wrightson's cover of DC Comics' \"House of Secrets\" #92 (June–July 1971), the first appearance of Swamp Thing and was hired by McFadden-Bartell, a magazine publisher and distributor and worked there for three years. She and Jeff Jones split up during this time but she continued to use the name Louise Jones for several years afterward.\n\nLouise met the comic book writer and artist Walt Simonson in 1973, began dating in August 1974, and married in 1980. They collaborated on \"X-Factor\" from 1988 to 1989, and made a cameo appearance in the 2011 \"Thor\" feature film together.\n\nIn 1974, Jones started her professional comic book career at Warren Publishing. She went from assistant to senior editor of the comics line (\"Creepy\", \"Eerie\", and \"Vampirella\") before leaving the company at the end of 1979.\n\nIn January 1980, she joined Marvel Comics, where she initially worked again as an editor, most notably on \"Uncanny X-Men\", which she edited for almost four years (#137–182). Simonson (as \"Louise Jones\") edited another X-Men spin-off, \"The New Mutants\", at its debut in 1983. After leaving the series, she had a \"cameo\" in \"New Mutants\" #21, drawn in as a slumber party guest by artist Bill Sienkiewicz. During this period, she also edited Marvel's \"Star Wars\" and \"Indiana Jones\" comics.\n\nIn 2017, she edited the graphic novel \"Son of Shaolin\" for Image Comics.\n\nAt the end of 1983, she quit her editing job at Marvel to try her hand at full-time writing as Louise Simonson. She created the Eagle Award-winning \"Power Pack\". The title, which debuted in August 1984, featured the adventures of four pre-teen superheroes. Simonson wrote the majority of the title's first forty issues, even coloring one issue (#18). Her other Marvel writing work included \"Starriors\", \"Marvel Team-Up\", \"Web of Spider-Man\", and \"Red Sonja\". Louise helped her husband Walt Simonson color his \"Star Slammers\" story in \"Marvel Graphic Novel\" #6 (1983).\n\nIn 1986 Bob Layton, writer of the X-Men spin-off \"X-Factor\", was running late on a deadline, and Simonson was called in to write a fill-in issue of \"X-Factor\". This story was never published, since Layton ultimately turned his story in on time, but while writing it Simonson found herself inspired by the characters, to the point where she brought a list of her ideas to editor Bob Harras in the hopes that Layton might use them for the series. Instead, Layton ended up dropping \"X-Factor\" shortly after, and at Chris Claremont and Ann Nocenti's suggestion, Harras chose Simonson as his replacement. In #6, her first issue, she and artist Jackson Guice introduced Apocalypse, a character who would go on to make repeated appearances in the X-Men franchise. From #10 of the title, she was joined by her husband, Walt Simonson, on pencils. In #25, the creators gave the character, Angel, blue skin and metal wings in a process which led to his being renamed as \"Archangel\". It was at Simonson's suggestion that X-Men writer Chris Claremont's \"Mutant Massacre\" story idea was turned into a crossover through all the \"X-books\", the first of its kind. Her run on \"X-Factor\" included the relevant installments of \"Mutant Massacre\", and the subsequent crossovers \"Fall of the Mutants,\" \"Inferno\", and \"X-Tinction Agenda\". She ended her run on the title with #64 in 1991.\n\nIn 1987, beginning with issue #55, she became the \"New Mutants\" scripter. Similarly to \"X-Factor\", she was originally brought in as a fill-in writer so that Chris Claremont could launch two other titles, but ended up writing the series for three and a half years, ending with #97 in 1991. It was during this run that she and artist Rob Liefeld introduced Cable, another important character in the X-Men franchise. In 1988–89, she and her husband co-wrote the \"Havok and Wolverine: Meltdown\" limited series painted by Jon J Muth and Kent Williams.\n\nIn 1991, Simonson began writing for DC Comics. She, artist Jon Bogdanove, and editor Mike Carlin launched a new Superman title, \"\" — a title she wrote for eight years until #86 in 1999. She contributed to such storylines as \"Panic in the Sky\" in 1992. Later that year, Simonson (along with Carlin, Dan Jurgens, Roger Stern and others) was one of the chief architects of \"The Death of Superman\" storyline, in which Superman died and was resurrected. It was during that storyline, in \"The Adventures of Superman\" #500 (June 1993), that Simonson and Bogdanove introduced their character Steel, who graduated to his own title in February 1994, with Simonson as writer until #31. The character went on to feature in an eponymous feature film starring Shaquille O'Neal in 1997. Simonson was one of the many creators who worked on the \"\" one-shot in 1996 wherein the title character married Lois Lane.\n\nIn 1999, Simonson returned to Marvel to write a \"Warlock\" series, which featured a character from her previous \"New Mutants\" run. That same year, she wrote a miniseries, \"Galactus the Devourer\", in which Galactus died temporarily. In 2005, she wrote stories featuring Magnus, Robot Fighter for the publisher Ibooks, Inc. In 2007, Simonson wrote a one-shot starring Magik of the New Mutants as part of a four-issue event known as \"Mystic Arcana\". In 2009, she wrote two issues of \"Marvel Adventures\" featuring Thor. The next year, she scripted the five-part limited series \"X-Factor Forever\" and reunited with June Brigman for a new \"Power Pack\" story in \"Girl Comics\" #3. Simonson also co-wrote the comic \"World of Warcraft\", based on the multi-million player internet game, for Wildstorm, and a manga story, based in the Warcraft universe, for Tokyopop. In 2011, DC hired Louise Simonson to write \"DC Retroactive:\" \"Superman - The '90s\", pencilled by her \"Man of Steel\"-collaborator Jon Bogdanove. \n\nSimonson wrote the \"Five Minutes\" chapter in \"Action Comics\" #1000 (June 2018). In 2019, she contributed two stories to \"DC Primal Age\" #1 and teamed up with June Brigman again for the one-shot \"Power Pack: Grow Up\".\n\nFrom 1993 through 2009, she wrote five picture books and eleven novels for middle-readers, many of which featured characters from DC Comics. Two YA novels, \"Justice League: The Gauntlet\" and \"Justice League: Wild at Heart\", published by Bantam Books, were based on the Justice League cartoon. She wrote an adult \"Batman\" novel and the non-fiction \"DC Comics Covergirls\".\n\n\nComics work includes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to Gardner, morality is not an arbitrary social construct, but an eternal truth, taking on different forms but not essentially changing through the ages. He says that moral fiction \"attempts to test human values, not for the purpose of preaching or peddling a particular ideology, but in a truly honest and open-minded effort to find out which best promotes human fulfillment.\"\n\nLeo Tolstoy, among others, espouses similar views in his essay \"What is Art?\", and Gardner draws upon Tolstoy in his argument.\n\n"}

It is a novel of social protest which explores issues of that time period related to class and religion.\n\nThe word \"Parineeta\" is translated in English as \"married woman\". The literal meaning comes from Bengali (Sanskrit) word \"পরিণয়/परिणय/Parinay\" - \"marriage\".\n\n\"Parineeta\" takes place at the turn of the 20th century during the Bengal Renaissance. The story centers around a poor thirteen-year-old orphan girl, Lalita, who lives with the family of her uncle Gurucharan. Gurucharan has five daughters, and the expense of paying for their weddings has impoverished him. He is forced to take a loan from his neighbour, Nabin Roy, by mortgaging a plot of land with him. The two neighbouring families share a very cordial relationship, although Nabin Roy does covet Gurucharan's mortgaged plot. Nabin Roy's wife, Bhuvaneshwari, dotes on the orphan Lalita and showers love upon her; the latter reciprocates even to the extent of addressing Bhuvaneshwari as 'maa'(mother). Roy's younger son Shekharnath (Shekhar), a 25-26-year-old man-about-town, lately turned attorney, has a joking, bantering relationship with Lalita, his mother's protégée. The young girl adores him like her mentor, and for some strange reasons, ratifies and accepts his possessive attitude towards her.\n\nThe advent of a supportive Girin in Lalita's life, a certain jealousy transpired within Shekhar which tended to moderate Lalita's increasing associations with Girin who has now extended his helping hand to Gurucharan's finances and also assisted him in finding a match for Lalita. These situations seemed to stir the instinctual passions of Shekhar and somewhat Lalita for each other and one evening before Shekhar's tour to the west, the duo secretly gets married with a dramatic exchange of garlands formed of marigolds. But a newly married Lalita had to conceal herself in the veil of her spinsterhood as her uncle Gurucharan quits his fight with the law and orders of Hindu society and embraces Brahmoism inspired from the angelic words of Girin. The society abandons them and the same is followed by Shekhar towards Lalita upon his return (though mixed with covetousness over Girin's influence on her family). His jeopardies in introducing his wife amidst the society because of the differences in wealth, religion and more importantly due to a precluded marriage of marrying an under-aged woman made him harsh and arrogant towards Lalita who drowned in agony, decides to accompany her family to Munger as a means of healing her psychologically tormented uncle anguished by the sense of isolation. Girin aided them all through his journey to whom Gurucharan had his dying wish of marrying his daughter (suggestively indicated to his niece Lalita) which Girin accepts wholeheartedly.\n\nYears pass with the passing of both Gurucharan and Nabin Roy and an eighteen year old Lalita visits her old place one last time for the sake of selling Gurucharan's house to Nabin Roy's heirs since the deceased desired the plot for a long time. Shekhar has his marriage fixed in a week but Lalita's advent questions him over his real wishes but he has heard of Girin's promise to marry Lalita which must have been fulfilled by now. Tables turn as Girin visits Shekhar with the Legal documents of Gurucharan's plot and amidst the conversation reveals that he indeed became Gurucharan's son-in-law as per his promise but never married Lalita but married her cousin Annakali upon her suggestion as Lalita claimed herself to be already married. Shockingly pleased by this, Shekhar regains himself and his now realised love for Lalita goes to his mother and confesses about his marriage with Lalita. The novella ends with consent for this marriage a declaration of union for Shekhar and Lalita.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Parineeta\" has been adapted to film a number of times:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its vine can grow to long, with pinnate leaves long with 5–7 leaflets. The flowers are usually pink, purple, or red-brown, and are produced in dense racemes in length. The fruit is a legume (pod) long. Botanically speaking, the tubers are rhizomatous stems, not roots. Its natural range is from Southern Canada (including Ontario, Quebec, and New Brunswick) down through Florida and West as far as the border of Colorado. It is a larval host for the Epargyreus clarus.\n\nThe tubers are highly palatable with culinary characteristics of a potato, although the flavor can be somewhat nuttier than a potato and the texture can be finer. Studies in rats suggest that raw tubers should not be consumed. They contain harmful protease inhibitors that are denatured by cooking. These tubers contain roughly three times the protein content of a potato (16.5% by dry weight), and the amino acid balance is good with the exception of cysteine and methionine. \"Apios americana\" tubers were found to have a protein concentration of . This was similar to that of other species in the Apios genus, \"A. carnea\" and \"A. fortunei\". However, \"A. americana\" had larger levels of genistein than the other two species. The fatty acid content of tubers is approximately 4.2% to 4.6%, with linoleic fatty acids predominating. Thirty-six percent of the fresh weight of a tuber is carbohydrate (primarily starch). The tubers are also an excellent source of calcium and iron. Calcium content is 10-fold greater than a potato and iron is 2-fold greater than a potato, although vitamin C was considerably less than a potato. The tuber and the flower also contain mono and oligosaccharides. The tuber has more monosaccharides and oligosaccharides than the soybean, potato, and sweet potato. \n\nIn addition, the tubers appear to have numerous health-promoting factors. Hypertensive rats that were fed powdered tubers as 5% of their total diet had a 10% decrease in blood pressure and also a reduction in cholesterol and triglycerides. It has been shown that the tubers contain genistein and other isoflavones that have various health benefits, including an anti-carcinogenic function against colon, prostate, and breast cancer. Genistein-7-O-gentiobioside is a novel isoflavone that is found in the American groundnut. Extract from the American groundnut was shown to drive the anti-oxidative pathway in cells although it did not have anti-oxidative activity itself. Human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells were pretreated with the extract of \"A. americana\" for 24 hours. Subsequent analysis showed an increase in expression of heme oxygenase-1, a protein induced during oxidative stress. The American groundnut, like soybean, is a great source of isoflavone. \n\nFurthermore, a study on \"A. americana\" and its flower shows that the flower of the particular plant is not toxic to mice. Consumption of the flower was shown to lower plasma glucose levels in diabetic mice. The flower was shown to have an inhibitory activity on maltose and an anti-hyperglycemic effect in mice, suggesting that not only is it a viable and novel food source for the general population, but also in the prevention of diabetes.\n\nThe only place in the world today where American groundnuts are commercially farmed in any significant quantities is in Japan. Before the American groundnut was introduced to Japan, the people on the main island of Honshu and the northern island of Hokkaido were already familiar with a native, wild plant called hodoimo (Apios fortunei), which was occasionally eaten as an emergency food. It is believed that sometime during the Meiji period (1868-1912), American groundnut was accidentally or deliberately brought to Japan. One theory is that American groundnut was accidentally brought to Japan as a stowaway weed among apple seedlings imported from North America. Another theory is that American groundnut may have been deliberately brought to Japan in the middle of the Meiji period as an ornamental flower. \n\nIt has become a culinary specialty of the Aomori Prefecture, where American groundnut agriculture is centered. It has been eaten there for more than one hundred years. Although American groundnut agriculture is primarily identified with agriculture in the Aomori prefecture, it is grown in the nearby prefectures of Akita and Miyagi as well. In addition, it is known to be grown in the southern part of Honshu in the Tottori prefecture. Radioactive testing records following the Fukushima nuclear disaster record cesium testing of American groundnut agricultural products in the central prefecture of Tochigi. \n\nAn important part of the spread and popularization of American groundnut consumption in Japan has been the efforts of Dr. Kiyochika Hoshikawa to promote the cultivation of this crop in Japan, and the flurry of scientific articles on the health benefits of eating American groundnut tubers. Japanese websites that sell American groundnut continue to emphasize its health benefits in their marketing efforts. There are reports of American groundnut cultivation in South Korea as well, where it is grown for its nutritional benefits.\n\nThe tubers and seeds can both be cooked and eaten.\n\nThe tubers were a staple food among most Indigenous peoples of the Americas within the natural range of the plant. In 1749, the travelling Swedish botanist Peter Kalm writes, \"Hopniss or Hapniss was the Indian name of a wild plant, which they ate at that time... The roots resemble potatoes, and were boiled by the Indians who ate them instead of bread.\" Strachey in 1612 recorded observations of the Indigenous peoples found in Virginia: \"In June, July, and August they feed upon roots of tockohow, berries, groundnutts, fish, and greene wheate...\" In Eastern Canada, the Jesuit missionary, Le Jeune, observed that the Indigenous peoples there would, \"eat, besides, roots, such as the bulbs of the red lily; ... another that our French people call 'Rosary' because it is distinguished by tubers in the form of beads.\" The early author Rafinesque observed that the Cree were cultivating the plant for both its tubers and seeds. The author Brinton wrote in 1885 in regards to the Lenape people, \"Of wild fruits and plants they consumed the esculent and nutritious tubers on the roots of the Wild Bean, Apios tuberosa... which the Indians called hobbenis...\" In 1910, Parker writes that the Iroquois were consuming significant quantities of groundnuts up until about thirty years before his writing. The Paris Documents of 1666 record that the sixth tribe of the second division of the Iroquois were identified as, \"that of the Potatoe, which they call Schoneschironon\" and an illustration of tubers is found in the Paris Documents with the explanation, \"This is the manner they paint the tribe of the Potatoe.\" The author Gilmore records the use of groundnuts by the Caddoan and Siouan tribes of the Missouri river region, and the authors Prescott and Palmer record its use among the Sioux. The Indigenous peoples would prepare the tubers in many different ways, such as frying them in animal fat or drying them into flour. Many tribes peeled them and dried them in the sun, such as the Menomini who built scaffolds of cedar bark covered with mats to dry their tubers for winter use. The Menomini would sometimes dry the tubers in maple syrup or make a preserve of Groundnut tubers by boiling them in maple syrup. The Potawatomi traditionally boiled their tubers. The Meskwaki and Chippewa would peel, parboil, slice, and dry the tubers, and the Chippewa were fond of using the tubers as a sort of seasoning in all their foods. \n\nThe Europeans learned to use the American groundnut from the Indigenous peoples of the Americas. As a result, the American groundnut became interwoven with the history of the American colonies and Europe. The early traveler John Brereton was sustained by the \"good meat\" and \"medicinable\" qualities of American groundnut during his travels in New England in 1602. In 1613, the followers of Beincourt at Port Royal ate the tubers to help them survive in the New World. The American groundnut was an important factor in the survival of the Pilgrims during the first few winters of their settlement. In 1623 the Pilgrims, \"having but a small quantity of corn left,\" were \"enforced to live on groundnuts... and such other things that the country afforded... and were easily gotten...\". The Pilgrims were taught to find and prepare American groundnut by the Wampanoag people. The groundnut was likely eaten at the harvest festival of November 1621 that is regarded as the first Thanksgiving, although only venison was specifically named as a food item at this meal by a Pilgrim eyewitness account. \n\nPhilosopher Henry David Thoreau commented on the nutty flavor and dry texture in October 1852. \n\nIt is believed that American groundnut may have been shipped to Europe as early as 1597. It was listed in 1885 as a European garden crop. In 1845 it was evaluated as a possible alternative potato crop in Ireland during the potato famine. These early introductions to Europe appear to have resulted in little or no assimilation of the new food into the European diet. A primary reason for this lack of assimilation was that the two-year cycle for an acceptable tuber yield did not match the cropping systems that were familiar to Europeans.\n\nAmerican groundnut is generally considered to be an undomesticated crop. Gretchen Beardsley in her 1939 description of the Native American use of American groundnut states that several historical sources describe the \"cultivation\" of American groundnut by Indigenous peoples. She dismisses the ambiguous term \"cultivation\" as perhaps referring to transplantation of tubers near a settlement. She quotes the historical author Waugh on this subject of cultivation: \"sometimes planted in suitable locations, though they are not, strictly speaking, cultivated.\" It appears that all subsequent authors on American groundnut have followed Beardsley's interpretation of \"cultivation\" when referring to the early use by Indigenous peoples of American groundnut.\n\nIn 1985, Dr. William J. Blackmon, Dr. Berthal D. Reynolds, and their colleagues at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge began a program of deliberate domestication of American groundnut. Their primary goal was to develop an American groundnut that can produce a significant yield in a single season. Early trials identified LA85-034 as a promising cultivar, with \"elongate tubers of uniform, medium size with light brown skin and little extra rhizomatous material\". By 1988, they had collected wild seeds and tubers from 210 plants found in 19 states, although the bulk of their selections came from the state of Louisiana. From these wild materials, and a small number of single crosses, they rigorously selected for plants that met their primary breeding goals of (1) larger tuber size, (2) denser tuber set, (3) single season production, and (4) productivity in untrellised cultivation. The American groundnut domestication program at Louisiana State University continued in various forms until the mid-1990s. Cultivars from this program can still occasionally be found available from small seed companies.\n\nFrom 1985 to 1994, an Apios breeding program took place that resulted in the collection of over two hundred wild accessions. These accessions underwent hybridization and selection, and over 2,200 lines were assessed. Of these lines, only 53 genotypes were kept for further analysis. Three different locations and three different growing conditions—field, pots, and grow-bags— were used. There was significant variation found among almost all of the 20 genotypes in the field growing condition. Inter-node length, plant vigor, and stem diameter during plant growth were positively correlated with the plant yield below ground. There were four distinct genotypic clusters found in this collection of Apios lines. Several genotypes yielded large plants in all locations, maxing up to of below ground tuber. This suggests that the plant has a good ability to adapt and grow in a wide variety of locations and conditions. Furthermore, the superior germplasm identified in this project may be suitable as cultivars, and will aid in further development of Apios lines as a crop.\n\nThe largest germplasm collection of Apios americana cultivars today is found at Iowa State University under the direction of Dr. Steven Cannon. It is maintained there for scholarly and academic use. Research continues at Iowa State on the domestication of American groundnut.\n\nDespite these efforts at domestication, the American groundnut remains largely uncultivated and underused in North America and Europe. There are challenges to breeding and domesticating this plant, as well. There seems to be a partial self-incompatibility with Apios breeding and manual pollinations, resulting in rare seed-sets. Disadvantages in Apios as a crop are its vining habit. The crop has small tuber size for most genotypes. These sizes are typically smaller than ; however, some do average around . The tuber plant is difficult to harvest because of the \"beads on a string\" arrangement on stolons, which extend for over a meter.\n\nAmerican groundnut fixes its own nitrogen, which could be a great advantage in comparison to other roots crops, such as potatoes, true yams, and sweet potatoes. These do not fix their own nitrogen and require large applications of nitrogen fertilizer. American groundnut can be nodulated by bacterial strains that are normally found in symbiosis with soybeans or cowpeas. \n\nResearch has been done on the potential of the soybean strain B. japonicum to nodulate American groundnut. It was found that plants nodulated with \"B. japonicum\" yielded ~30% better than unnodulated plants if no nitrogen fertilizer was used. It was also determined that nodulated plants partitioned more carbon into non-edible shoots when they were given nitrogen fertilizer, whereas unnodulated plants responded to nitrogen fertilizer with greater tuber yields than nodulated plants. This data suggests that nitrogen fertilization may be required to maximize tuber size and yields in \"A. americana\".\n\nAmerican groundnut is normally 2n=2x=22, diploid, but both diploid and triploid forms exist. Only diploids are capable of producing seeds; triploids will produce flowers but not seeds. Thus, triploids are entirely dependent on tuber division for propagation whereas diploids can be propagated through both seeds and tubers. Other than seed production, there are no easily identifiable differences between diploids and triploids. Triploids are generally found in the Northern part of American groundnut's range whereas diploids predominate in the Southern part of the range. Triploids have been identified in the provinces or states of New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Connecticut, Vermont, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and Iowa. A few diploids have been found in the Northeastern part of the range, such as along the Black River in Central Ontario. All samples tested in the Southeastern United States have been found to be diploid.\n\n"}

The paper was later published in various locations until Split was liberated on 26 October 1944. From the following day onward, \"Slobodna Dalmacija\" has been published in Split.\n\nAlthough it was originally viewed as a strictly Dalmatian regional newspaper, during the following decades \"Slobodna Dalmacija\", grew into one of the largest and most widely read daily newspapers of Yugoslavia, with its circulation reaching a zenith in the late 1980s. \"Slobodna Dalmacija\" owed much of that success to its humour section. Many of the most popular Croatian humourists, like Miljenko Smoje, Đermano Ćićo Senjanović and the trio that later founded the \"Feral Tribune\", began their careers there. \n\nAnother reason for this success was the editorial policy of Joško Kulušić, who used the decline of Communism to allow the paper to become a forum for new political ideas. In the early 1990s \"Slobodna Dalmacija\" established a reputation as the newspaper with the most politically diverse group of columnists - from the extreme left to the extreme right. \nIn 1992, the government initiated proceedings against the paper, which would ultimately result in one of the most notorious scandals in recent Croatian history. \"Slobodna Dalmacija\" was privatised, which resulted in Miroslav Kutle, a Zagreb businessman, becoming the new owner. After a brief attempt to prevent the handover by strike, the paper was formally taken over in March 1993. \n\nAfter the war ended in 1995, \"Slobodna Dalmacija\" was faced with serious financial problems. In the late 1990s the newspaper was again taken over by the government. However, it retained its distinctively hard-line nationalist stance, even during the first year of Prime Minister Ivica Račan's left-of-center government. \n\nIn May 2005 \"Slobodna Dalmacija\" was reprivatised again. This time it was sold to Europapress Holding, making it a sister paper of \"Jutarnji list\". In 2014 it was bought by Marijan Hanžeković along with EPH and became more of a right-wing newspaper. There have been situations where left oriented journalist were forbidden to write what they want (such as Damir Pilić in 2015) and some were fired (such as Boris Dežulović).\n"}
{"id": "2025904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2025904", "title": "Meth mouth", "text": "Meth mouth\n\nMeth mouth is severe tooth decay and tooth loss, as well as tooth fracture, acid erosion, and other oral problems, potentially symptomatic of extended use of the drug methamphetamine. The condition is thought to be caused by a combination of side effects of the drug (clenching and grinding of teeth, dry mouth) and lifestyle factors (infrequent oral hygiene, frequent consumption of sugary drinks, as well as neglecting regular dental cleanings and preventive care), which may be present in long-term users. However, the legitimacy of meth mouth as a unique condition has been questioned because of the similar effects of some other drugs on teeth. Images of diseased mouths are often used in anti-drug campaigns.\n\nThe condition is difficult to treat, and may involve fillings, fluoride to fight tooth decay and drugs that increase saliva for dry mouth, as well as oral hygiene instruction. It can be dangerous for active methamphetamine users to undergo \ndental surgery because of the cardiac problems that can result from the interaction of local anesthetic with the drug.\n\nMethamphetamine (informally referred to as \"meth\") is a stimulant drug with a high potential for addiction in its recreational users. It incurs physical and psychological side effects that users find desirable. Other side effects (like bruxism and stimulant psychosis) can result in users neglecting their dental health, eventually leading to advanced tooth decay (caries) and gum infections. Further, a common side effect of stimulant drugs is xerostomia, which accelerates tooth decay.\n\n, methamphetamine is the most discussed illegal drug in dental literature for its extensive effect on users' dental health. The teeth of some methamphetamine users appear to be dark and extensively eroded. The epithet \"meth mouth\" is the result of these superficial presentations of advanced tooth decay and gum infection. Caries often occur in the cervical regions of teeth, where the tooth surface narrows at the junction of the crown and the root; decay is primarily centered on the buccal (cheek) side of the teeth, and on tooth surfaces that are adjacent to incisors and canines. Eventually, the coronal tooth area (near the crown) can be affected by the decay and erosion. The dental caries of meth mouth often progress slowly, perhaps because their advancement is hindered by intermittent hygienic practices. The decay can lead to tooth fractures and severe pain. In some cases, teeth are permanently damaged and must be removed. Along with malnutrition and weight loss, the dental effects of methamphetamine use contribute to the appearance of premature aging seen in some users.\n\nMethamphetamine users sometimes experience soreness in the joint of the jaw and dental attrition (tooth wear) due to bruxism, a common side effect of stimulant drugs. This bruxism can occur continuously. Chronic use of the drug might also cause trismus, the inability to open the jaw.\n\nThe effects of meth mouth are similar to those of Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease that causes a lack of saliva, which results in tooth decay.\n\nThe hypothesized causes of meth mouth are a combination of MA side effects and lifestyle factors which may be present in users:\n\n\nThe dental effects of long-term methamphetamine use are often attributed to its effects on saliva. The reduction in saliva increases the likelihood of dental caries, enamel erosion, and periodontal disease. Although it is clear that use of the drug decreases saliva, the mechanism by which it does so is unclear. One theory is that the drug causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels) in salivary glands, decreasing salivary flow. This constriction is thought to be due to the activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors by both methamphetamine itself and norepinephrine, the levels of which are dramatically increased by methamphetamine use. These factors can be compounded by dehydration, which occurs in many methamphetamine users after drug-induced increases in metabolism. The characteristics of the saliva produced during use of the drug, which includes high protein content, may also contribute to the sensation of dry mouth.\n\nLong-term methamphetamine use can cause parafunctional habits, routine actions of a body part that are different than their common use, which can result in tooth wear and exacerbate periodontal diseases. One such habit that may affect the development of meth mouth is bruxism, particularly as the drug's effects wane and stereotypy occurs, a phase that is often referred to as \"tweaking\". This bruxism may be due to a drug-induced increase in monoamines. Other behaviors of long-term methamphetamine users that may cause or accelerate the symptoms of meth mouth are the failure to pay attention to oral hygiene and excessive food intake during binges, especially sugary foods; the drug's users often report strong cravings for sugar and consume large amounts of high-sugar beverages. The altered mental state that accompanies methamphetamine use lasts longer than that of some other common drugs, increasing the amount of time the user engages in drug-induced behavior.\n\nHydrochloric acid is used in methamphetamine's manufacturing process, but academic reviews have not supported the idea that the acid contributes to dental decay. Speculation that oral consumption of the drug causes tooth decay by raising the acidity of users' mouths is also unsupported. Meth mouth is generally most severe in users who inject the drug, rather than those who smoke, ingest or inhale it.\n\nThe damaging effects of meth mouth on the teeth and gums for the most part are irreversible, although, if treated at an early stage, they can be dramatically reduced through the habitual use of common hygienic practices; Under normal circumstances, the user will not seek a remedy until the damage has already begun to take control causing severe mouth pain and general discomfort. Because many drug users lack the access to dental treatment, due to affordability and poverty, it is important to take medical precautions to prolong the lifespan of the mouth, and health in general. Those who are willing to seek dental treatment should seek professional advice as soon as possible if they are experiencing any painful symptoms relatable to meth mouth from abusing methamphetamine. Providing dental treatment to individuals who use methamphetamine can be dangerous, because the potential combination of local anesthetic and methamphetamine can cause serious heart problems. There is also an increased risk of serious side effects if opioid medications are used in the patient's treatment.\n\nTreatment of meth mouth usually attempts to increase the flow of saliva, halt tooth decay, and encourage behavioral changes.\n\nToothpaste with fluoride is very important to the restoration of dental health. Prescription fluoride rinses can adequately treat the condition as well. Sialogogues, drugs that increase the amount of saliva in the mouth, can be used to treat dry mouth and protect against dental health problems. Pilocarpine and cevimeline are sialogogues approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat low salivation caused by Sjögren syndrome and may have the potential to effectively treat dry mouth caused by methamphetamine use.\n\nThere have not been any controlled studies on meth mouth, and several of its aspects are unclear. Although the condition has been popularized by media coverage and case reports, no systematic studies have been conducted to conclusively tie methamphetamine use to symptoms that are commonly described as meth mouth. There are few ties between dental scholars and those who study drug use, and it can be difficult for dental researchers to find methamphetamine users to study.\n\nWhether the drug has a unique effect on dental health has been questioned by a few academics, who note that the long-term use of several other drugs sometimes causes dental problems. Several academic reviews have contradicted this perspective, affirming meth mouth's status as a discrete condition. In favor of its unique status, these reviews cite the differences between methamphetamine-caused caries and those that occur for other reasons, such as cocaine use, as well as the scope of the tooth decay found in some long-term methamphetamine users.\n\nAlthough most methamphetamine users lived in Asia in the early 2000s, the use of the drug increased dramatically in other parts of the world in that decade. In areas where use of the drug has become common, meth mouth is often widespread. The condition is expensive to treat and has strained public health resources, prompting concerns among dental authorities in several countries about the burden of treatment.\n\nImages of meth mouth are usually considered disturbing and have been used in anti-drug campaigns, even being placed on hoardings/billboards. The condition is often mentioned in media coverage of methamphetamine, and it has been included in media portrayals of drug abuse to demonstrate the scope of the drug's effects or to provoke disgust in the audience. Opponents argue that the term is used to negatively stereotype methamphetamine users, and that it is falsely portrayed as inevitable or characteristic.\n\nThe drama series \"Breaking Bad\", which centres around the production of crystal meth, features a number of minor characters who have meth mouth. The series creator Vince Gilligan has said one of his regrets about the series is that one of the lead characters, Jesse Pinkman, (played by Aaron Paul), had perfect teeth because he felt this was unrealistic, given the amount of meth the character consumed.\n\n\nBooks\n\nJournals\n\nNewspapers\n\n"}

{"id": "2025912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2025912", "title": "Coalition for a European Montenegro", "text": "Coalition for a European Montenegro\n\nCoalition for a European Montenegro (Montenegrin: Коалиција за Европску Црну Гору, \"Koalicija za Evropsku Crnu Goru\") was the ruling political alliance in Montenegro headed by Milo Đukanović's Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS).\n\nConsisting of two additional parties (SDP and Liberals), \"Coalition for European Montenegro\" is the latest installment of the DPS-led political alliances that have ruled Montenegro since 1998. This current ruling alliance, much like its earlier predecessors did, derives its strength and is driven by the prestige and personal authority of Milo Đukanović.\n\nFollowing the internal turmoil within the DPS during late 1996 and early 1997 when the party's most prominent members Milo Đukanović and Momir Bulatović bitterly fought behind the scenes for the control of the party, Đukanović emerged as the clear winner of the year-long power struggle. Under his leadership, DPS began entering pre-election alliances with smaller parties under the coalition banner that had a different name ahead of each parliamentary elections.\n\nThe dynamic within the coalition's various installments is always such that his party DPS is naturally entering it from an overwhelming position of strength while the other small party(ies) merely round out the ballot.\n\nThe first version of the coalition was formed ahead of the 1998 parliamentary elections in Montenegro under the name So that we live better (Да живимо боље, \"Da živimo bolje\"). Before the 2001 elections the coalition was rebranded as Victory is Montenegro's (Побједа је Црнe Горe, \"Pobjeda je Crne Gore\"). Then, before the 2002 elections the coalition was known as (Democratic) List for European Montenegro (Листа за европску Црну Гору, \"Demokratska lista za evropsku Crnu Goru\"), and finally before the 2006 elections it became the Coalition for European Montenegro.\n\nThe party that has been DPS' and Đukanović's most continual ally is SDP CG, part of every single version of the coalition.\n\nIn 1998 DPS forged a wide alliance in an attempt to compete with the newly created pro-Milošević Socialist People's Party of Montenegro (SNP) led at the time by former DPS leader Momir Bulatović.\n\nĐukanović-led DPS called for an alliance between anti-Milošević parties, stating that Milošević's political pursuits were leading FR Yugoslavia into ruin. It made a coalition with the Social Democratic Party of Montenegro (SDP) that supported outright independence and the People's Party of Montenegro (NS) that wanted Montenegro to remain in a state with Serbia. DPS's own position at the time was that Montenegro and Serbia should be in a single unified state, but they opposed Milošević's rule.\n\nThe 1998 parliamentary election on May 31 essentially turned into another showdown between Đukanović and Bulatović over a single issue - Slobodan Milošević. Đukanović's coalition won, seizing 42 of 78 total parliamentary seats. Those 42 seats were then divided up three ways according to the coalition agreement: DPS received 32 seats while its coalition partners NS and SDP got 5 each.\n\nFor DPS it meant less actual seats belonging to the party than after the previous election when they got 45 of 71 total seats alone by themselves. However, they were now ruling through a coalition, which benefited the party's image in other ways as it created a perception of openness and pluralism.\n\nAs far as SDP was concerned getting 5 seats was a remarkable success - the party entered parliament for the first time in its history and could now influence the republic's official policy, neither of which they could dream of had they entered the election alone.\n\nFrom NS perspective, getting 5 seats was not a big reason for celebration since the party had a distinct voting base at the time, meaning they would've surely gotten more had they entered alone, but they were now in a ruling coalition, in position to influence official policy and were happy to be there as long as DPS supported the idea of a unified state with Serbia.\n\nThough never stable and cohesive, during its first year, the government formed by the \"So that we live better\" coalition was able to internally agree on basic matters and reach the minimum consensus. Big political test came in March 1999 when NATO military alliance started bombing FR Yugoslavia. Despite Montenegro being spared from the heaviest bombing, SDP and even fringe parts of DPS capitalized on the bombing to aggressively push the idea of an independent Montenegrin state. This political discourse, however, never made it into any of the government's official policy. In fall 1999, initiated by Đukanović, Montenegro drafted a document called \"Platforma za redefiniciju odnosa Crne Gore i Srbije\" (A platform for redefinition of relations within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) and sent it to Belgrade. In an atmosphere when Đukanović-Milošević relations were strained to a maximum, the platform called for major changes in the division of governing responsibilities within FR Yugoslavia. Though still officially seeing itself within a state with Serbia, Đukanović-led Montenegro wanted many things changed and redefined.\n\nHowever, after the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević in October 2000 (which many saw to be a positive sign in future relations between Montenegro and Serbia and a way to quickly repair the damaged relationship), contrary to expectations, DPS made a complete turnaround and now suddenly started pushing for complete independence thus completely abandoning the platform they wrote just a year earlier. Consequently the mainstream of the ruling coalition started to openly support the idea of an independent Montenegro and this became an official government policy, all of which caused huge international outrage and outright opposition from the European Union.\n\nIn the resulting crisis, the pro-unity People's Party left the government dissatisfied with DPS' turnaround. Subsequently, inner quarrels between DPS CG on one side and LSCG on the other came out over filling in NS CG's vacant occupation in the government. NS subsequently joined the newly formed pro-Yugoslavian Together for Yugoslavia of Predrag Bulatović of the reformed SNP, which based itself on countering this alliance's newfound independentist ideology, emphasizing the necessity of keeping the state together with Serbia. Additionally, LSCG also withdrew from the government, on the allegations that DPS was not sincere in decisions to make Montenegro independent and that it was stalling it. The rump DPS-SDP of the once greater alliance lost control over the government. New elections were scheduled in 2001.\n\nIt ran on the 2001 Montenegrin parliamentary election as the \"Victory is Montenegro's\" (composed of the rump remains of the once large coalition; Democratic Party of Socialists and its sole partner, SDP). The coalition lost parliamentary majority, winning just 36 of 77 seats (30 for DPS and 6 for SDP). Contrary to everyone's expectation, the now opposing, once former ally, Liberal Alliance supported it to form a minority government under Filip Vujanović. But closer aligning of LSCG with the Together for Yugoslavia bloc distanced it from the minority coalition. The government signed the Belgrade Agreement in 2002, by which the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was transformed into the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro and the Republic of Montenegro re-integrated into political structure with its great sister-republic. According to the agreement, the Deputy President of DPS Svetozar Marović became the country's first President. The frustrated pro-independence Liberal Alliance withdrew its support and crashed Vujanović's government. New elections were scheduled for 2002.\n\nAs the \"List for European Montenegro\" (composed out of Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro, Social Democratic Party of Montenegro, Civic Party of Montenegro, Liberal Democratic Party and the People's Concord of Montenegro), it won the 2002 Montenegrin parliamentary election receiving 39 of 75 seats in the Parliament of the Republic of Montenegro. DPS CG received 31 seat, SDP CG 7 and GP 1. NSCG received no seat as promised, but entered the later in 2003 elected Parliament of Serbia and Montenegro with one seat as compensation. LDP because of insufficient share in the total parliament, LDP was excluded completely.\n\nIn the 2006 election the alliance \"For European Montenegro\" won with 41 out of 81 seats. 32 seats were supposed to go DPS and 8 to SDP. The Coalition's seats were split 33 for DPS, 7 for SDP and 1 for HGI.\n\nCoalition for a European Montenegro won the absolute majority in the 2009 election. The result translates to 47 out of the 81 seats in the Parliament. The turnout among the nearly 500,000 registered voters was around 67 per cent. Milo Đukanović secured his sixth term as the Prime Minister with 50.8% of the vote.\n\nIn the 2012 election this alliance is formed by DPS, SDP and the Liberal Party of Montenegro. The result of 2012 election was a victory for the ruling Coalition for a European Montenegro led by Milo Đukanović, which won 39 of the 81 seats.Milo Đukanović secured his seventh term as the Prime Minister with 45.60% of the vote.\n\nOn 22 January 2016 SDP's president Ranko Krivokapić announced that SDP will left the coalition with DPS and will support the non-confidence vote against the government of Milo Đukanović on 25 January. In this way, after 18 years, the coalition between these two parties ended.\n\n\n"}

It is the only party in Montenegro to have full membership in the Socialist International.\n\nOn 14 July 1991 reformists from four coastal municipalities in the SR Montenegro, Herceg Novi, Kotor, Tivat and Budva, who were subsequently joined by reformists from Cetinje, formed the first regional Montenegrin political party - the \"Alliance of Reformists of the Montenegrin Coastline\" with Miodrag Marović as President. On 7 July 1992 the League united with Žarko Rakčević's Party of Socialists desiring to create a major Montenegrin party, forming the \"Social Democratic Party of Reformists of Montenegro\". Finally, on 12 June 1993 the \"Independent Organization of Communists\" of Bar, the \"Alliance of Reform forces of Yugoslavia for Montenegro\" and the \"Party of National Tolerance\" merged into it, forming the Social Democratic Party of Montenegro and uniting the forces that opposed the policies of the Milošević regime during the Yugoslav wars. Eventually, \"Yugoslav People's Party\" and \"Old Yugoslav People's Party\" also merged into SDP in the following years. Notable SDP founders include Žarko Rakčević and Ljubiša Stanković.\n\nWhen the policies of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro (DPS) turned towards the goal of full independence for Montenegro, DPS and SDP started working closely together to achieve this goal. Allying itself with the DPS and Đukanović ahead of the 1998 parliamentary elections allowed the SDP to enter the parliament for the first time in its history. Since the 1998 election, SDP has continued to a minor coalition partner of DPS and a part of every Montenegrin government between 1998 and 2015. The goal of restoration of the Montenegrin independence was achieved following the victory in a referendum held on 21 May 2006. Current president of the SDP and President of the Parliament of Montenegro from 2003 to 2016, Ranko Krivokapić, officially proclaimed the independence of Montenegro on 3 June 2006.\n\nFollowing the shift of the party towards a more critical and independent political course, in Autumn 2015 the pro-DPS faction of SDP formed a new party named Social Democrats of Montenegro (SD). On 22 January 2016, SDP officially left the ruling coalition with DPS and announced its support for a vote of no confidence against the government of Milo Đukanović on 25 January 2016. In the following 2016 parliamentary election SDP ran independently for the first time since 1996, and retained its parliamentary status, winning 5.23% of votes.\n\nAt the 2018 presidential elections, SDP nominated its MP Draginja Vuksanović, who was the first female presidential candidate in the history of Montenegro. Vuksanović finished third, winning 8.2% of the votes. On 29 June 2019, after Krivokapić resignation, Vuksanović was elected new president of the Party, making her the only female president of a Montenegrin political party, at the time. On this occasion, former President Krivokapic has been named honorary president.\n\nNotes:\n\n<br>\n\nMajor positions held by Social Democratic Party of Montenegro members:\n\n"}
{"id": "2025919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2025919", "title": "Pattern (sewing)", "text": "Pattern (sewing)\n\nIn sewing and fashion design, a pattern is the template from which the parts of a garment are traced onto fabric before being cut out and assembled. Patterns are usually made of paper, and are sometimes made of sturdier materials like paperboard or cardboard if they need to be more robust to withstand repeated use. The process of making or cutting patterns is sometimes condensed to the one-word Patternmaking, but it can also be written pattern(-)making or pattern cutting.\n\nA sloper pattern (home sewing) or block pattern (industrial production) is a custom-fitted, basic pattern from which patterns for many different styles can be developed. The process of changing the size of a finished pattern is called grading.\n\nSeveral companies, like Butterick and Simplicity, specialize in selling pre-graded patterns directly to consumers who will sew the patterns at home. Commercial clothing manufacturers make their own patterns in-house as part of their design and production process, usually employing at least one specialized patternmaker. In bespoke clothing, slopers and patterns must be developed for each client, while for commercial production, patterns will be made to fit several standard body sizes.\n\nA patternmaker typically employs one of two methods to create a pattern.\n\nThe flat-pattern method is where the entire pattern is drafted on a flat surface from measurements, using rulers, curves and straight-edges. A pattern maker would also use various tools such as a notcher, drill and awl to mark the pattern. Usually, flat patterning begins with the creation of a sloper or block pattern, a simple, fitted garment made to the wearer's measurements. For women, this will usually be a jewel-neck bodice and narrow skirt, and for men an upper sloper and a pants sloper. The final sloper pattern is usually made of cardboard or paperboard, without seam allowances or style details (thicker paper or cardboard allows repeated tracing and pattern development from the original sloper). Once the shape of the sloper has been refined by making a series of mock-up garments called \"toiles\" (UK) or \"muslins\" (US), the final sloper can be used in turn to create patterns for many styles of garments with varying necklines, sleeves, dart placements, and so on. The flat pattern drafting method is the most commonly used method in menswear; menswear rarely involves draping. You can learn pattern drafting on many fashion design courses either on a short further education course or as part of a Fashion degree at a university. \n\nThe draping method involves creating a muslin mock-up pattern by pinning fabric directly on a form, then transferring the muslin outline and markings onto a paper pattern or using the muslin as the pattern itself.. Designers drafting an evening gown or a sculpted dress which uses a lot of fabric, typically cut on the bias, will use the draping technique, as it is very difficult to produce with a flat pattern. \n\nAfter a paper/fabric pattern is completed, very often pattern-makers digitize their patterns for archiving and vendor communication purposes. The previous standard for digitizing was the digitizing tablet. Nowadays, automatic option such as scanner and cameras systems are available.\n\nMass market patterns are made standardized, while human bodies vary, so store-bought patterns only fit a small proportion of people well, and an experienced sewist can adjust standard patterns to better fit any body shape. So, a sewist may choose a standard size (usually from the wearer's bust measurement) that has been pre-graded on a purchased pattern. They may decide to tailor or adjust a pattern to improve the fit or style for the garment wearer, using french curves, hip curves, and cutting or folding on straight edges. There are alternate methods, either directly on flat pattern pieces from measurements, using a pre-draped personalized sloper or using draping methods on a dress form with inexpensive fabrics like muslin.\n\nCreating a muslin (also called toile using calico), similar to a garment template, is one method of fitting. Muslin material is inexpensive and is easy to work with when making quick adjustments by pinning the fabric around the wearer or a dress form. The sewist cuts muslin pieces using the same method that they will use for the actual garment, according to a pattern. The muslin pieces are then fit together and darts and other adjustments are made. This provides the sewer with measurements to use as a guideline for marking the pattern pieces and cutting the fabric for the finished garment.\n\nPattern grading is the process of shrinking or enlarging a finished pattern to accommodate it to people of different sizes. Grading rules determine how patterns increase or decrease to create different sizes. Fabric type also influences pattern grading standards. The cost of pattern grading is incomplete without considering marker making.\n\nSewing patterns typically include standard symbols and marks that guide the cutter and/or sewer in cutting and assembling the pieces of the pattern. Patterns may use: \n\nMany patterns will also have full outlines for some features, like for a patch pocket, making it easier to visualize how things go together.\n\nThe making of industrial patterns begins with an existing block pattern that most closely resembles the designer's vision. Patterns are cut of oak tag (manila folder) paper, punched with a hole and stored by hanging with a special hook. The pattern is first checked for accuracy, then it is cut out of sample fabrics and the resulting garment is fit-tested. Once the pattern meets the designer's approval, a small production run of selling samples is made and the style is presented to buyers in wholesale markets. If the style has demonstrated sales potential, the pattern is graded for sizes, usually by computer with an apparel industry specific CAD program. Following grading, the pattern must be vetted; the accuracy of each size and the direct comparison in laying seam lines is done. After these steps have been followed and any errors corrected, the pattern is approved for production. When the manufacturing company is ready to manufacture the style, all of the sizes of each given pattern piece are arranged into a marker, usually by computer. A marker is an arrangement of all of the pattern pieces over the area of the fabric to be cut that minimizes fabric waste while maintaining the desired grainlines. It's sort of like a pattern of patterns from which all pieces will be cut. The marker is then laid on top of the layers of fabric and cut. Commercial markers often include multiple sets of patterns for popular sizes. For example: one set of size Small, two sets of size Medium and one set of size Large. Once the style has been sold and delivered to stores – and if it proves to be quite popular – the pattern of this style will itself become a block, with subsequent generations of patterns developed from it.\n\n\nHome sewing patterns are generally printed on tissue paper and sold in packets containing sewing instructions and suggestions for fabric and trim. They are also available over the Internet as downloadable files. Home sewers can print the patterns at home or take the electronic file to a business that does copying and printing. Many pattern companies distribute sewing patterns as electronic files as an alternative to, or in place of, pre-printed packets, which the home sewist can print at home or take to a local copyshop, as they include large format printing versions. Modern patterns are available in a wide range of prices, sizes, styles, and sewing skill levels, to meet the needs of consumers.\n\nThe majority of modern-day home sewing patterns contain multiple sizes in one pattern. Once a pattern is removed from a package, you can either cut the pattern based on the size you will be making or you can preserve the pattern by tracing it. The pattern is traced onto fabric using one of several methods. In one method, tracing paper with transferable ink on one side is placed between the pattern and the fabric. A tracing wheel is moved over the pattern outlines, transferring the markings onto the fabric with ink that is removable by erasing or washing. In another method, tracing paper is laid directly over a purchased pattern, and the pieces are traced. The pieces are cut, then the tracing paper is pinned and/or basted to the fabric. The fabric can then be cut to match the outlines on the tracing paper. Vintage patterns may come with small holes pre-punched into the pattern paper. These are for creating tailor's tacks, a type of basting where thread is sewn into the fabric in short lengths to serve as a guideline for cutting and assembling fabric pieces.\n\nBesides illustrating the finished garment, pattern envelopes typically include charts for sizing, the number of pieces included in a pattern, and suggested fabrics and necessary sewing notions and supplies.\n\nEbenezer Butterick invented the commercially produced graded home sewing pattern in 1863 (based on grading systems used by Victorian tailors), originally selling hand-drawn patterns for men's and boys' clothing. In 1866, Butterick added patterns for women's clothing, which remains the heart of the home sewing pattern market today.\n\n<br>\nCommercial sewing pattern companies\n\nIndependent (Indie) sewing pattern companies<br>\n\n\nMaking clothes with no patterns<br>\n\n\n"}

He began his career in thoroughbred horse racing in 1938 and first gained national recognition in 1941, when he rode War Relic to an upset win in the Narragansett Special over the 1941 U.S. Triple Crown winner Whirlaway. For 12 of his 21 years in the sport, Atkinson was contract rider for the wealthy New York City Whitney family's Greentree Stable. In 1944, he was North America's leading jockey in both number of wins and money earned. He repeated the feat in 1946, when he became the first rider to achieve purse earnings of more the $1 million in a single season.\n\nRiding Greentree's colt Capot, Atkinson just missed winning the U.S. triple Crown in 1949 when he finished second in the Kentucky Derby then won both the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes. Capot shared Horse of the Year honors with Coaltown, after beating the older horse in the Pimlico Special. Atkinson was also the jockey for all of Hall of Famer Tom Fool's races, guiding the colt to a perfect season of 10 wins in 10 starts, including the New York Handicap Triple and winning the Horse of the Year honors in 1953.\n\nIn 1957, Ted Atkinson was voted the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award and that same year became the first active jockey elected to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. He was then invited to appear on the CBS television's \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". In an article on jockey Eddie Arcaro, \"TIME\" magazine wrote that: \"He [Arcaro] also gives a large share of credit to gentlemanly Jockey Ted Atkinson, who helped raise the standard of sportsmanship on New York tracks.\" \n\nFollowing his retirement in 1959 as a result of a back injury, Atkinson became a racing official and served as State Steward in Illinois from 1961 until 1976.\n\nAtkinson, who had been fighting a lengthy cancer-related illness, died at his home near Beaverdam, Virginia after several strokes, a few weeks short of his 89th birthday. He was survived by his wife, Martha; children Cathie, John and Mark; and three grandchildren, Johanna, William and television personality and racing analyst Caton Bredar.

{"id": "2025982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2025982", "title": "Canaan Dog", "text": "Canaan Dog\n\nThe Canaan Dog, also known as the Bedouin Sheepdog and Palestinian Pariah Dog, is a breed of pariah dog from the Middle East. This dog is found in Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, the Sinai peninsula, and these or dogs very similar are found in Egypt, Iraq, and Syria. There are 2,000 to 3,000 Canaan dogs across the world, mostly in Europe and North America.\n\nSince time immemorial, the Bedouins have used this dog for guarding their herds and camps. According to tradition, at the time of the Diaspora the Israelites were forcefully removed from their land and had to leave behind their dogs, which reverted to the wild.\n\nExcavations in Israel unearthed the Ashkelon dog cemetery, the largest known animal cemetery in the ancient world, containing 700 dog skeletons all of which were anatomically similar to the Canaan dog of modern times. The cemetery dates back to the time of occupation by the Persian Empire and archaeologists hypothesize that the dogs were revered as sacred animals.\n\nDr. Rudolphina Menzel (1891–1973) used these intelligent scavenger-dogs mainly found in the desert as guard dogs. In the 1930s, Menzel was asked by the Haganah to build up a service dog organization. She captured a select group of semi-wild individuals, tamed, trained and bred them. Menzel found the dogs highly adaptable, trainable, and easy to domesticate. It took her about six months to capture her first dog, Dugma, and within a few weeks she was able to take him into town and on buses. She began a breeding program in 1934, providing working dogs for the military and she gave pups to be pets and home guard dogs. She initiated a selective breeding program to produce the breed known today as the Canaan dog.\nIn 1949, Menzel founded The Institute for Orientation and Mobility of the Blind, and in 1953, she started to train Canaan dogs as guide dogs for the blind. Although she was able to train several dogs, she found that the breed was too independent and too small for general guide dog use, although some of her dogs were used successfully by children. Her breeding program was concentrated with the Institute, where a foundation of kennel-raised Canaan dogs was established, carrying the name \"B'nei Habitachon\". In addition, a controlled collection of dogs of the original type was continued, primarily from the Bedouin of the Negev. She later supplied breeding stock to Shaar Hagai Kennels which continued in the breeding of the Canaan dog.\n\nAfter her death in 1973, Shaar Hagai Kennels, managed by Dvora Ben Shaul and Myrna Shiboleth, continued the breeding program according to her instructions.\n\nCollection of wild Canaan dogs has become very difficult. Many of the Canaan dogs living in the open were destroyed by the Israeli government in the fight against rabies. The spread of the human population into areas that were formerly isolated, along with their pet dogs, has resulted in the loss of the natural habitat of the Canaan. Even the majority of Bedouin dogs today, other than those of tribes still living a traditional and isolated life style, are mixed with other breeds. Myrna Shiboleth visits the Negev regularly, looking for good specimens living by the Bedouin camps, that she can breed with her dogs and use to strengthen the gene pool.\n\nThe Canaan Dog is a typical primitive dog in appearance. It is a medium-sized square built dog, with a wedge-shaped head, erect and low set ears with a broad base and rounded tips. Its outer coat is dense, harsh and straight of short to medium-length. The undercoat should be close and profuse according to season. Color ranges from black to cream and all shades of brown and red between, usually with small white markings, or all white with colour patches. Spotting of all kinds is permitted, as well as white or black masks.\n\nRudolphina Menzel classified these canines into four types: \nMenzel concluded that the Canaan Dog is a derivative of the Type III pariah — the collie type (referring to the type of farm collie found in the 1930s which was a medium dog of moderate head type more similar to today's Border Collie, not the modern Rough Collie).\n\nIn writing the first official standard for the Canaan Dog, Menzel wrote: \"Special importance must be placed on the points that differentiate the Canaan-dog from the German dog, whose highly bred form he sometimes resembles: the Canaan-dog is square, the loin region short, the forequarters highly erect, the hindquarters less angular, the neck as noble as possible, the tail curled over the back when excited, the trot is short (see also differences in head and color)\".\n\nCanaan dogs have a strong survival instinct. They are quick to react and wary of strangers, and will alert to any disturbances with prompt barking, thus making them excellent watchdogs. Though defensive, they are not aggressive and are very good with children within the family, but may be wary of other children or defensive when your child is playing with another child. They are intelligent and learn quickly, but may get bored with repetitive exercises or ignore commands if they find something of more interest.\n\nCanaan dogs can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Canaans exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\nIn general, the Canaan dog does not have significant (known) hereditary problems. Although the breed is one of the healthiest, veterinarian George A. Padgett has listed diseases that have been observed in the Canaan dog: hypothyroidism, epilepsy, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), cryptorchidism, hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, luxating patella, and osteochondritis dissecans (OCD).\n\nThe Canaan dog was first recognized by the Israel Kennel Club in 1953 and by the FCI (Federation Cynologique Internationale) in 1966. The first accepted standard was written by Dr. Menzel. In 1986, the first Canaan dogs were brought to Finland from Sha'ar Hagai Kennel, in Israel. The Canaan Dog is today recognized by all the world's kennel clubs and is being bred in many countries. There are breed clubs in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Finland, Germany, Israel and France.\n\nThe first Canaan dog came to Canada May 16, 1970. The dogs came from a kennel in Delaware. The Canadian Canaan Club was formed in 1972, and the first executive of the Club was elected on March 15, 1973. The club has since been dissolved. The Canaan dog obtained entry into the Miscellaneous Class of the Canadian Kennel Club on December 1, 1975. In January 1993, the breed was accepted in the Working Group, as the Canadian Kennel Club did not have a Herding group at that time.\n\nThe first Canaan Dog was brought to the UK from Lebanon in 1965, before they were a recognized breed. In December 1970, they were recognized by the Kennel Club, and the breed was placed in the Utility Group. In May 1992 the inaugural meeting of the Canaan Dog Club of the United Kingdom took place. Since 1996 the breed has begun to grow in numbers in the UK, though it is still quite numerically small.\n\nOn September 7, 1965, Menzel sent four dogs to Ursula Berkowitz of Oxnard, California, the first Canaan dogs in the United States. The Canaan Dog Club of America was formed the same year, and stud book records were kept from these first reports. In June 1989, the Canaan dog entered the American Kennel Club (AKC) Miscellaneous Class. Its profile was raised when John F. Kennedy Jr. purchased a Canaan dog, Friday, in 1995. Canaan dogs were registered in the AKC Stud Book as of June 1, 1997. The dogs began competing in conformation on August 12, 1997.\n"}

This theorem has particular application to astronomy.\n\nIsaac Newton proved the shell theorem and stated that:\n\nA corollary is that inside a solid sphere of constant density, the gravitational force within the object varies linearly with distance from the centre, becoming zero by symmetry at the centre of mass. This can be seen as follows: take a point within such a sphere, at a distance formula_1 from the centre of the sphere. Then you can ignore all the shells of greater radius, according to the shell theorem. So, the remaining mass formula_2 is proportional to formula_3 (because it is based on volume), and the gravitational force exerted on it is proportional to formula_4 (the inverse square law), so the overall gravitational effect is proportional to formula_5, so is linear in formula_1.\n\nThese results were important to Newton's analysis of planetary motion; they are not immediately obvious, but they can be proven with calculus. (Alternatively, Gauss's law for gravity offers a much simpler way to prove the same results.)\n\nIn addition to gravity, the shell theorem can also be used to describe the electric field generated by a static spherically symmetric charge density, or similarly for any other phenomenon that follows an inverse square law. The derivations below focus on gravity, but the results can easily be generalized to the electrostatic force. Moreover, the results can be generalized to the case of general ellipsoidal bodies.\n\nThere are three steps to proving Newton's shell theorem. First, the equation for a gravitational field due to a ring of mass will be derived.  Arranging an infinite number of infinitely thin rings to make a disc, this equation involving a ring will be used to find the gravitational field due a disk.  Finally, arranging an infinite number of infinitely thin discs to make a sphere, this equation involving a disc will be used to find the gravitational field due to a sphere.\n\nThe gravitational field at a position called \"P\" at (x,y)=(-p,0) on the x axis due to a point of mass \"M\" at the origin is:formula_7 Suppose that this mass is moved upwards along the y axis to point (0,R).  The distance between P and the point mass is now longer than before; it becomes the hypotenuse of the triangle with sides p and R which is: formula_8.formula_9 The magnitude of the gravitational field that would pull a particle at point P in the x direction is the gravitational field multiplied by cos(theta) where theta is the angle adjacent to the x axis.  In this case, formula_10formula_11Simplified,formula_12Suppose that this mass is evenly distributed in a ring centered at the origin and facing point P with the same radius R.  Because all of the mass is located at the same angle with respect to the x axis, and the distance between the points on the ring is the same distance as before, the gravitational field in the x-direction at point P due to the ring is the same as a point mass located at a point \"R\" above the y axis:formula_13 To find the gravitational field at point P due to a disc, an infinite number of infinitely thin rings facing point P, each with a radius y, width of dy, and mass of dM may be placed inside each other to form a disc.  The mass of any of the rings dM is the mass of the disc multiplied by the ratio of the area of the ring formula_14 to the total area of the disc formula_15.  So, formula_16formula_17 formula_18Adding up the contribution to the gravitational field from each of these rings will yield the expression for the gravitational field due to a disc.  This is equivalent to integrating this above expression from y=0 to y=R, resulting in:formula_19To find the gravitational field at point P due to a sphere centered at the origin, an infinite amount of infinitely thin discs facing point P, each with a radius R, width of dx, and mass of dM may be placed together.\n\nThese discs' radii R follow the height of the cross section of a sphere (with constant radius \"a\") which is an equation of a semi-circle : formula_20.  x varies from -a to a.\n\nThe mass of any of the discs dM is the mass of the sphere M multiplied by the ratio of the volume of an infinitely thin disc divided by the volume of a sphere (with constant radius a).  The volume of an infinitely thin disc is formula_21, or formula_22.  So, formula_23.  Simplified, formula_24.  x varies from -a to a.\n\nEach discs' position away from the point P will vary with its position within the 'sphere' made of the discs.  So p must be replaced with p+x.  x varies from -a to a.\n\nReplacing M with dM, R with sqrt(a^2-x^2), and p with p+x in the 'disc' equation yields:formula_25Simplifying,formula_26Integrating the field due to each thin disc from x=-a to x=+a with respect to x, and after careful algebra, beautifully yields Newton's shell theorem.\n\nformula_27 where p is the distance between the center of the spherical mass and a point P.  A spherical mass's gravitational field may be calculated by treating all the mass as a point particle at the center of the sphere.\n\nA solid, spherically symmetric body can be modelled as an infinite number of concentric, infinitesimally thin spherical shells. If one of these shells can be treated as a point mass, then a system of shells (i.e. the sphere) can also be treated as a point mass. Consider one such shell (the diagram shows a cross-section):\n\nApplying Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation, the sum of the forces due to mass elements in the shaded band is\n\nHowever, since there is partial cancellation due to the vector nature of the force in conjunction with the circular band's symmetry, the leftover component (in the direction pointing toward \"m\") is given by\n\nThe total force on \"m\", then, is simply the sum of the force exerted by all the bands. By shrinking the width of each band, and increasing the number of bands, the sum becomes an integral expression:\n\nSince \"G\" and \"m\" are constants, they may be taken out of the integral:\n\nTo evaluate this integral, one must first express \"dM\" as a function of \"dθ\"\n\nThe total surface of a spherical shell is\n\nwhile the surface area of the thin slice between \"θ\" and \"θ\" + \"dθ\" is\nIf the mass of the shell is \"M\", one therefore has that\n\nand\n\nBy the law of cosines,\n\nand\n\nThese two relations link the three parameters \"θ\", \"φ\", and \"s\" that appear in the integral together. As \"θ\" increases from 0 to π radians, \"φ\" varies from the initial value 0 to a maximal value before finally returning to zero at \"θ\" = π. At the same time, \"s\" increases from the initial value \"r\" − \"R\" to the final value \"r\" + \"R\" as \"θ\" increases from 0 to π radians. \nThis is illustrated in the following animation:\n\nTo find a primitive function to the integrand, one has to make \"s\" the independent integration variable instead of \"θ\".\n\nPerforming an implicit differentiation of the second of the \"cosine law\" expressions above yields\n\nand thus\n\nIt follows that\n\nwhere the new integration variable \"s\" increases from \"r\" − \"R\" to \"r\" + \"R\".\n\nInserting the expression for cos(\"φ\") using the first of the \"cosine law\" expressions\nabove, one finally gets that\n\nA primitive function to the integrand is\n\nand inserting the bounds \"r\" − \"R\", \"r\" + \"R\" for the integration variable \"s\" in this primitive function, one gets that\n\nsaying that the gravitational force is the same as that of a point mass in the centre of the shell with the same mass.\n\nFinally, integrate all infinitesimally thin spherical shell with mass of \"dM\", and we can obtain the total gravity contribution of a solid ball to the object outside the ball\n\nBetween the radius of \"x\" to \"x\" + \"dx\", \"dM\" can be expressed as a function of \"x\", i.e.,\n\nTherefore, the total gravity is\n\nwhich suggests that the gravity of a solid spherical ball to an exterior object can be simplified as that of a point mass in the centre of the ball with the same mass.\n\nFor a point inside the shell, the difference is that when \"θ\" is equal to zero, \"ϕ\" takes the value π radians and \"s\" the value \"R\" - \"r\". When \"θ\" increases from 0 to\nπ radians, \"ϕ\" decreases from the initial value π radians to zero and \"s\" increases from the initial value \"R\" - \"r\" to the value \"R\" + \"r\".\n\nThis can all be seen in the following figure\nInserting these bounds into the primitive function\n\none gets that, in this case\n\nsaying that the net gravitational forces acting on the point mass from the mass elements of the shell, outside the measurement point, cancel out.\n\nGeneralization: If formula_28, the resultant force inside the shell is:\n\nThe above results into formula_29 being identically zero if and only if formula_30\n\nOutside the shell (i.e. r>R or r<-R):\n\nThe shell theorem is an immediate consequence of Gauss's law for gravity saying that\n\nwhere \"M\" is the mass of the part of the spherically symmetric mass distribution that is inside the sphere with radius \"r\" and\n\nis the surface integral of the gravitational field g over any closed surface inside which the total mass is \"M\", the unit vector formula_31 being the outward normal to the surface.\n\nThe gravitational field of a spherically symmetric mass distribution like a mass point, a spherical shell or a homogenous sphere must also be spherically symmetric. If formula_32 is a unit vector in the direction from the point of symmetry to another point the gravitational field at this other point must therefore be\n\nwhere \"g\"(\"r\") only depends on the distance \"r\" to the point of symmetry\n\nSelecting the closed surface as a sphere with radius \"r\" with center at the point of symmetry the outward normal to a point on the surface, formula_33, is precisely the direction pointing away from the point of symmetry of the mass distribution.\n\nOne, therefore, has that\n\nand\n\nas the area of the sphere is 4π\"r\".\n\nFrom Gauss's law it then follows that\ni.e. that\n\nIt is natural to ask whether the converse of the shell theorem is true, namely whether the result of the theorem implies the law of universal gravitation, or if there is some more general force law for which the theorem holds. More specifically, one may ask the question:\n\nIn fact, this allows exactly one more class of force than the (Newtonian) inverse square. The most general force as derived in is:\n\nwhere formula_34 and formula_35 can be constants taking any value. The first term is the familiar law of universal gravitation; the second is an additional force, analogous to the cosmological constant term in general relativity.\n\nIf we further constrain the force by requiring that the second part of the theorem also holds, namely that there is no force inside a hollow ball, we exclude the possibility of the additional term, and the inverse square law is indeed the unique force law satisfying the theorem.\n\nOn the other hand, if we relax the conditions, and require only that the field everywhere outside a spherically symmetric body is the same as the field from some point mass at the centre (of any mass), we allow a new class of solutions given by the Yukawa potential, of which the inverse square law is a special case.\n\nAnother generalization can be made for a disc by observing that \n\nso:\n\nwhere formula_36, and formula_37 is the density of the body.\n\nDoing all the intermediate calculations we get:\n\nPropositions 70 and 71 consider the force acting on a particle from a hollow sphere with an infinitesimally thin surface, whose mass density is constant over the surface. The force on the particle from a small area of the surface of the sphere is proportional to the mass of the area and inversely as the square of its distance from the particle. The first proposition considers the case when the particle is inside the sphere, the second when it is outside. The use of infinitesimals and limiting processes in geometrical constructions are simple and elegant and avoid the need for any integrations. They well illustrate Newton's method of proving many of the propositions in the \"Principia\". \n\nHis proof of Propositions 70 is trivial. In the following, it is considered in slightly greater detail than Newton provides.\n\nThe proof of Proposition 71 is more historically significant. It forms the first part of his proof that the gravitational force of a solid sphere acting on a particle outside it is inversely proportional to the square of its distance from the centre of the sphere, provided the density at any point inside the sphere is a function only of its distance from the centre of the sphere.\n\nAlthough the following are completely faithful to Newton's proofs, very minor changes have been made to attempt to make them clearer.\n\nFig. 2 is a cross-section of the hollow sphere through the centre, S and an arbitrary point, P, inside the sphere. Through P draw two lines IL and HK such that the angle KPL is very small. JM is the line through P that bisects that angle. From the geometry of circles, the triangles IPH and KPL are similar. \nThe lines KH and IL are rotated about the axis JM to form 2 cones that intersect the sphere in 2 closed curves. In Fig. 1 the sphere is seen from a distance along the line PE and is assumed transparent so both curves can be seen. \n\nThe surface of the sphere that the cones intersect can be considered to be flat, and angles formula_38\n\nSince the intersection of a cone with a plane is an ellipse, in this case the intersections form two ellipses with major axes IH and KL, where formula_39\n\nBy a similar argument, the minor axes are in the same ratio. This is clear if the sphere is viewed from above. Therefore the two ellipses are similar, so their areas are as the squares of their major axes. As the mass of any section of the surface is proportional to the area of that section, for the 2 elliptical areas the ratios of their masses formula_40.\n\nSince the force of attraction on P in the direction JM from either of the elliptic areas, is direct as the mass of the area and inversely as the square of its distance from P, it is independent of the distance of P from the sphere. Hence, the forces on P from the 2 infinitesimal elliptical areas are equal and opposite and there is no net force in the direction JM. \n\nAs the position of P and the direction of JM are both arbitrary, it follows that any particle inside a hollow sphere experiences no net force from the mass of the sphere.\n\nNote: Newton simply describes the arcs IH and KL as 'minimally small' and the areas traced out by the lines IL and HK can be any shape, not necessarily elliptic, but they will always be similar.\n\nFig. 1 is a cross-section of the hollow sphere through the centre, S with an arbitrary point, P, outside the sphere. PT is the tangent to the circle at T which passes through P. HI is a small arc on the surface such that PH is less than PT. Extend PI to intersect the sphere at L and draw SF to the point F that bisects IL. Extend PH to intersect the sphere at K and draw SE to the point E that bisects HK, and extend SF to intersect HK at D. Drop a perpendicular IQ on to the line PS joining P to the centre S. Let the radius of the sphere be a and the distance PS be D.\n\nLet arc IH be extended perpendicularly out of the plane of the diagram, by a small distance ζ. The area of the figure generated is IH.ζ, and its mass is proportional to this product.\n\nThe force due to this mass on the particle at P formula_41 and is along the line PI. \n\nThe component of this force towards the centre formula_42.\n\nIf now the arc HI is rotated completely about the line PS to form a ring of width HI and radius IQ, the length of the ring is 2π.IQ and its area is 2π.IQ.IH. The component of the force due to this ring on the particle at P in the direction PS becomes formula_43.\n\nThe perpendicular components of the force directed towards PS cancel out since the mass in the ring is distributed symmetrically about PS. Therefore, the component in the direction PS is the total force on P due to the ring formed by rotating arc HI about PS.\n\nFrom similar triangles: formula_44; formula_45, and formula_46\n\nIf HI is sufficiently small that it can be taken as a straight line, SIH is a right angle, and the angles formula_47, so that formula_48.\n\nHence the force on P due to the ring formula_49.\n\nAssume now in Fig. 2 that another particle is outside the sphere at a point, p, a different distance, d, from the centre of the sphere, with corresponding points lettered in lower case. For easy comparison, the construction of P in Fig. 1 is also shown in Fig. 2. As before, ph is less than pt.\n\nGenerate a ring with width ih and radius iq by making angle formula_50 and the slightly larger Angle formula_51, so that the distance PS is subtended by the same angle at I as is pS at i. The same holds for H and h, respectively.\n\nThe total force on p due to this ring is \n\nClearly formula_52, formula_53, and formula_54.\n\nNewton claims that DF and df can be taken as equal in the limit as the angles DPF and dpf 'vanish together'. Note that angles DPF and dpf are not equal. Although DS and dS become equal in the limit, this does not imply that the ratio of DF to df becomes equal to unity, when DF and df both approach zero. In the finite case DF depends on D, and df on d, so they are not equal.\nSince the ratio of DF to df in the limit is crucial, more detailed analysis is required. From the similar right triangles, formula_55 and formula_56, giving formula_57. Solving the quadratic for DF, in the limit as ES approaches FS, the smaller root, formula_58. More simply, as DF approaches zero, in the limit the formula_59 term can be ignored: formula_60 leading to the same result. Clearly df has the same limit, justifying Newton’s claim.\n\nComparing the force from the ring HI rotated about PS to the ring hi about pS, the ratio of these 2 forces equals formula_61.\n\nBy dividing up the arcs AT and Bt into corresponding infinitesimal rings, it follows that the ratio of the force due to the arc AT rotated about PS to that of Bt rotated about pS is in the same ratio, and similarly, the ratio of the forces due to arc TB to that of tA both rotated are in the same ratio.\n\nTherefore, the force on a particle any distance D from the centre of the hollow sphere is inversely proportional to formula_62, which proves the proposition.\n\nAn analogue for shell theorem exists in general relativity (GR).\n\nSpherical symmetry implies that the metric has time-independent Schwarzschild geometry, even if a central mass is undergoing gravitational collapse (Misner et al. 1973; see Birkhoff's theorem). The metric thus has form \n(using geometrized units, where formula_64). For formula_65 (where formula_66 is the radius of some mass shell), mass acts as a delta function at the origin. For formula_67, shells of mass may exist externally, but for the metric to be non-singular at the origin, formula_68 must be zero in the metric. This reduces the metric to flat Minkowski space; thus external shells have no gravitational effect. \n\nThis result illuminates the gravitational collapse leading to a black hole and its effect on the motion of light-rays and particles outside and inside the event horizon (Hartle 2003, chapter 12).\n\n"}

{"id": "2026016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026016", "title": "Passion (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)", "text": "Passion (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)\n\n\"Passion\" is the seventeenth episode of the second season of the fantasy-horror television series \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (1997-2003). The episode was written by Ty King and directed by Michael Gershman, who served as the show's cinematographer. It originally aired on The WB Television Network in the United States on February 24, 1998.\n\nThe premise of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" is that an adolescent girl, Buffy Summers, is chosen by mystical forces and given superhuman powers to kill vampires, demons, and other evil creatures in the fictional town of Sunnydale. She is supported by a close circle of friends, nicknamed the Scooby Gang. In \"Passion\", Buffy attempts to protect herself and her close ones from Angelus and his murderous intent as Jenny Calendar continues to search for a spell to restore his soul.\n\nIn 2014, British singer Ed Sheeran sampled the episode's background theme \"Remembering Jenny\" for his song \"Afire Love\".\n\nBuffy wakes to find an envelope on her pillow containing a charcoal drawing of herself sleeping. Buffy asks Giles if there is a spell to reverse Angel's invitation into her house.\n\nBuffy explains to her mother that she has been having problems with Angel, whom she describes as an abusive ex-boyfriend. Later that night, Willow discovers that Angelus has been in her room too, leaving behind a sick gift of her dead goldfish hanging from a fishing line. Drusilla has a vision showing someone attempting to break up the newly reunited vampire family. Jenny goes to a Gypsy novelty shop to buy an Orb of Thesulah.\n\nBuffy confronts Jenny and explains that Giles misses her. Giles tells Buffy that he has found a ritual to revoke a vampire's invitation. Joyce finds Angelus waiting for her in the front yard. He starts to follow her into the house, but is unable to cross the threshold. Willow is shown reciting the ritual, and Buffy shuts the door in his face.\n\nWhen Giles finds Jenny working late at the school, he invites her to call at his house when she has finished. Jenny completes her translation of a ritual's text that, along with the Orb of Thesulah, will restore Angelus' soul. She jumps when she notices Angelus sitting in the dark at the back of the room. He smashes the Orb of Thesulah. Jenny flees but Angelus catches her and snaps her neck.\n\nGiles returns home to find the place decorated in a romantic setting with candles, wine and rose petals. As Giles follows the trail he finds Jenny's lifeless body. At Buffy's house, Angelus lurks outside. When the phone rings, he grins as the Slayer and Willow become stricken with grief at the news. Giles returns to his apartment to arm for battle. A drawing of Jenny's lifeless body is seen on a table.\n\nAt the factory, there is an explosive crash as the long dining table erupts in flame. Angelus, Drusilla, and Spike recoil and move to escape. Giles attacks Angelus with a flaming baseball bat. Angelus grabs him by the throat and lifts him clear off the floor as Buffy enters the fray. She breaks Giles free of Angelus' grasp and fights Angelus, but is distracted by the unconscious Giles, now completely surrounded by flames. As Angelus makes his escape, Buffy jumps down and half-carries Giles from the building.\n\nLater that night, Buffy apologizes for not being able to kill Angelus when she had the chance. The next day at the school, as Willow sets her books on the desk, the backup disk containing the translated ritual slides and falls into the narrow space between the desk and a filing cabinet.\n\nAccording to Joss Whedon, Jenny Calendar's death serves notice to fans, first, that \"no one\" is safe, death is scary and real, and second, that Angelus is not \"just a little evil,\" he's not \"grouchy,\" he's truly evil and Buffy needs to address the situation. The series creator also jokes that the episode is a message to the actors: \"Be very good, or I'll kill you.\"\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Anthony Stewart Head says this is his favorite episode, \"because it was a beautifully shot episode and a beautifully written one\". He also provides the vocals to the music for the scene at Jenny’s grave.\n\nAccording to Noel Murray from The A.V. Club, a recurring theme in \"Passion\" is \"the common feeling of being left out\".\n\n"}

According to an interview, the name originated from a song by Sigue Sigue Sputnik.\n\nIn 1995, the group's music debuted in Japan on a compilation album released by Torema Records, also affiliated with Untitled Records. Belgian record company R&S Records released their first single in Europe later that year. Kawashima and Nakano also appeared in the European magazine \"Melody Maker\", where they were lauded as the combination of The Chemical Brothers and The Prodigy. R&S Records released their first album, \"7 Ignitions/Auto Re-Birth\", on April 1, 1998, and the group performed at a large music festival the following June. The group then returned to Japan. Boom Boom Satellites toured with Moby for three months in the United States some time afterwards, and artists such as Garbage also requested remixes from the group.\nThe group has contributed numerous songs to various films, commercials, and television programs: In 2004, a number of tracks from the group's album, \"Full of Elevating Pleasures\", contributed to the soundtrack of the CGI anime film \"Appleseed\". In 2005, the song \"What Goes Around Comes Around\" from the album \"Exposed\", was featured in a commercial for Dodge, and \"Easy Action\" was included on the soundtrack of the 2007 anime film \"Vexille\". The same year, they played in the UK at the prestigious In The City music industry showcase festival. In 2008, the track \"Scatterin' Monkey\" from their 1998 album \"Out Loud\", was featured in the film \"The Dark Knight\" and \"Shut Up and Explode\" became the opening theme song for the PlayStation Store exclusive and later anime television series . In 2009, the single \"Back on My Feet\" is an additional opening theme song for the television broadcast of the series (the TV broadcast switches between \"Shut Up and Explode\" and \"Back on My Feet\").\n\nIn 2009, the band collaborated with Tahj Mowry and Flo Rida on a new envisioning of their track \"Kick It Out\". The track predominantly featured the lyrics of Tahj Mowry and Flo Rida in the verses, while the chorus remained the same as in the original release. Boom Boom Satellites added a new verse of their own not present on the original release. A music video was created for the song's release. That same year, Boom Boom Satellites released a remix for Fact's song \"A Fact of Life\" on the eponymous album.\nIn January 2010, Boom Boom Satellites released their first compilation album \"19972007\". The band released a new studio album in Japan, \"To the Loveless\", on May 26, 2010, which featured many tracks from the \"Back on My Feet\" EP. A limited edition version with bonus DVD was also released. In late 2010, the Boom Boom Satellites kicked off a North American tour, beginning with a performance at New York Comic Con. They also released \"Over and Over\" (an abbreviated version of \"19972007\") in the United States to coincide with the tour.\n\nIn 2012, Boom Boom Satellites announced that they would be performing the theme song for the fifth episode of \"Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn\", titled \"BROKEN MIRROR\", to begin the commemoration of their 15th anniversary since their debut. They also began a remix contest hosted by Nico Nico Douga, with the grand prize winner's remix of \"Broken Mirror\" included on their first remix album \"Remixed\". This followed by the release of the song \"Another Perfect Day\" was used as the theme song of the \"\" animated movie. With the delay of the release of \"Remixed\", the Boom Boom Satellites revealed that they were releasing their recent Japan-only singles internationally. Preceding the release of \"Remixed\", Boom Boom Satellites announced that their entire back catalog had been added to the Japan iTunes Store.\n\nTo celebrate their 15th anniversary together, Boom Boom Satellites released their eighth studio album \"Embrace\" on January 9, 2013. For their first promotional single for the album, the duo recorded a cover of the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\" as their first ever cover of any other artist. The Embrace 2013 tour had been planned to support the album as well as the group's 15th anniversary. However, in late December 2012 Kawashima was discovered to have symptoms of the early stages of a brain tumor, and the band cancelled all 23 shows scheduled from January to March 2013 to set aside for treatment and surgery; Nakano later revealed that Kawashima had a history of brain tumor issues, but this was the first time that they have had to cancel shows. The band decided that they would perform last few shows of December 2012, but had no plans to cancel the shows set for April and May 2013; the show in May was planned to be the band's first one-man live at the Nippon Budokan. On February 11, 2013, Nakano posted an update to the band's Facebook revealing that Kawashima had been discharged from the hospital and the two were writing and recording new songs. Following his recovery, the band announced that they were cancelling all but their Nippon Budokan show. This concert was later streamed live with 360 degree views on YouTube as part of YouTube Japan's Music Week as well as on Nico Nico Douga's live feature. In August 2013, they announced the concert would be released on an album due in November of that year, while also revealing that they were releasing \"Embrace\" internationally in September.\n\nIn 2014, Boom Boom Satellites created a new song, \"Only Blood\", for a special trailer for the film \"Monsterz\". Boom Boom Satellites performed at the Ex Theater Roppongi with Acidman on July 2, 2014. On July 4, 2014, the band announced that they would be composing the main theme, \"Back In Black\", for the anime adaptation of \"Ninja Slayer\". In late November 2014, the band announced that they would be releasing their new album \"Shine Like a Billion Suns\" in February 2015, supporting the album with a concert at the Tokyo EX Theater Roppongi in March 2015. On December 31, 2014, Nakano revealed in a blog post on their official website that Kawashima's brain tumor issue had once again relapsed at the conclusion of their March 2014 tour, making it the fourth time he had suffered a relapse, and after diagnosis had only been given two more years to live. However, after they had read about boron neutron capture therapy, Kawashima underwent the procedure, all the while writing the new album. Kawashima was informed that the spread of the tumors had been successfully stopped, and the band decided to share the information with their fans. Nakano mentioned how proud he was for Kawashima to be able to go through the procedures, continue to tour, and write the album.\n\nIn 2016, Boom Boom Satellites were announced to be performing the theme song for \"Kiznaiver\" titled \"Lay Your Hands on Me\". The version used for the anime was released as a single on April 17. A short music video was released on May 23, and it was announced that the full size version of the song would be released digitally on June 1, followed by a physical/digital EP on June 22 featuring 3 other tracks. On the day of the release, Nakano posted on the official website and on social media that the EP for \"Lay Your Hands on Me\" would be Boom Boom Satellites' final release, as Kawashima's tumors had relapsed for a fourth time and Kawashima was partially paralyzed. Nakano said that the \"Lay Your Hands on Me\" EP should be a suitable end to their career. On October 9, 2016, four months after the group stopped its activities, Kawashima died of his illness.\n\nThe next year, Nakano started to work with singer Toru Kitajima on intermittent songs in a project called Pandas, along with a remake of a theme song for \"\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In keeping with their design inspiration, traditional prairie skirts are usually made of \"country\" fabrics such as denim and flowered calico. Prairie skirts are a staple of women's western wear, and very full prairie skirts are worn for square dancing.\n\nPrairie skirts are so-called after their resemblance to the home-sewn skirts worn by pioneer women in the mid-19th century, which in turn are a simplified version of the flared, ruffled skirts characteristic of high-fashion dresses of the 1820s. The style originated as an adaptation of high fashion to the practicalities of rural life in the Western United States. Deep colors and prints were used as they did not show dirt, while decorations were used to update clothing to changing fashions. \n\nCounterculture Hippies rejecting mainstream fashion looked to historical and non-Western styles. While 19th century prairie clothing was usually homemade, new companies such as Gunne Sax in San Francisco began manufacturing ready to wear prairie clothing. The style grew in popularity in the 1970s with the approach of the United States Bicentennial and was introduced to high fashion by Ralph Lauren in his fall 1978 Western-themed collection.\n\nMid-calf length, button-front denim prairie skirts with a single flounce, worn with a 1950s-style petticoat that was slightly longer than the skirt, became a mainstream fashion in the 1970s and early 1980s following Lauren's introduction.\n\nShort, many-tiered prairie skirts of voile, chiffon or other lightweight fabrics were a fashion trend in 2005.

When he was a teenager, he played weddings and bar mitzvahs as part of Marsha and the Self-Portraits, sent out demos and majored in music at City College of New York where one of his teachers was guitarist David Bromberg. By the time he was 20, in 1975, he had a manager and a recording contract with Cashman and West's Lifesong label.\n\nIn the United States he is described as a one-hit wonder, following his 1977 hit song \"Ariel\", which reached number 26 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and stayed in the chart for five months. American Top 40 ranked it as the 87th biggest hit of 1977. On the \"Cash Box\" Top 100, it reached number 17. In Canada, the song reached number 19.\n\n\"Ariel\" has been described as a \"quirkily irresistible and uncategorizable pop song about a free spirited, music loving, vegetarian Jewish girl\", from Paramus, New Jersey, where he grew up. It is the only Billboard Top 40 song to contain the word Paramus. It describes the girl Ariel, \"standing by the [since dismantled] waterfall at Paramus Park\", one of the many shopping malls in Paramus. The quarters she was collecting for \"friends of BAI\" refers to the New York radio station WBAI-FM, and their listener association, while the song also makes reference to \"channel 2,\" which refers to local CBS affiliate WCBS-TV.\n\nAlthough \"Ariel\" did not make the UK Singles Chart, \"Lucky Stars\", a duet with Denise Marsa taken from his second album \"Well Well Said the Rocking Chair\", made No. 3 in the UK in late 1978, and both \"Woman of Mine\" and \"Lydia\" were lesser chart hits there.\n\nFriedman also provided vocals for a series of television commercials in the 1970s in the New York City metro area. However, while he did re-record and perform one version for an employee event, Freidman is falsely credited with creating and singing on the jingle for electronics chain Crazy Eddie's \"When you think you're ready, come down to Crazy Eddie\", which was actually created, performed, produced and recorded in its various versions (doo-wop, disco and other versions) by Larry Weiss (Crazy Eddie's VP Advertising) along with Jeff Gottschalk and John Russo.\n\nFriedman's single \"McDonald's Girl\" was officially banned by the BBC because the chorus mentioned the name of the fast food restaurant. In 2011, thirty years after the song was banned by the BBC, the McDonald's Corporation licensed \"McDonald's Girl\" for a national TV/Radio campaign, which aired in the US, featuring a vocal performance of the song by The Blenders.\n\nDuring 2005, as part of a tie-in to one of his tour sponsors, Friedman's tour of the United Kingdom was almost canceled after it was revealed he intended to distribute cannabis seeds to purchasers of his new album. Although it is not illegal to own or distribute cannabis seeds in this manner \"unless they get wet\", the suggestion caused friction with a number of venues on the tour, so the intended distribution was not carried out.\n\nThe songs of Dean Friedman have been covered by several contemporary bands, including The Barenaked Ladies, Ben Folds Five, Ariel Pink, The Tone Rangers, and The Blenders. The lead singer of Barenaked Ladies, Steve Page, sang background vocals on Friedman's album \"Songs For Grownups\" (1998).\n\nFriedman has written, performed and produced the theme music to several TV series including \"Boon\" (for which he did all of the music apart from the theme song which was performed by Jim Diamond), starring Michael Elphick. Other TV credits include \"Nick Arcade\" (Nickelodeon) and \"Eerie, Indiana\" (NBC). He also composed, performed and produced the soundtrack to the cult horror film, \"I Bought a Vampire Motorcycle\", in which he performs the track \"She Runs on Blood, Not Gasoline\".\n\nIn 1985, Friedman produced a seminal work on the newly emerging synthesizer industry called \"Complete Guide to Synthesizers, Sequencers, and Drum Machines\". Whilst dated, this tome published by New York Amsco is still of use in evaluating devices that crop up on the second-hand market. Friedman also set up the New York School of Synthesis and provided a series of videos entitled \"Intro to Synthesis\". Friedman presents the rudiments of this topic in an audio-visual format, whilst incorporating a unique sense of humor.\n\nIn 1986, Friedman saw a demo of a powerful virtual reality program that put the user right inside a video game using a video camera (similar to the technology used by the EyeToy). Friedman was impressed by the technology and wrote an article for \"Electronic Musician\" magazine. In 1989 he designed a game called \"Eat-A-Bug\" which was licensed to Nickelodeon TV, used on the series \"Total Panic\" and served as a prototype for the series \"Nick Arcade\", for which Friedman produced a dozen games. He is now the President and Creative Director of \"InVideo\" games.\n\nFriedman's album \"The Treehouse Journals\" was financed entirely by his fans via his website. Friedman invited people to finance the cost of the as-yet unrecorded album by making an advance purchase and by making limited edition signed copies available. This tactic has been adopted by other bands, including Marillion. He continued to tour, playing small venues.\n\nHe copied this tactic again in 2005, with the album \"Squirrels in the Attic\" and once more in 2017, with \"12 Songs\".\n\nHis sister, Racelle Rosett Schaefer, is a noted television writer who was executive producer of the show \"Blossom\", starring Mayim Bialik.\n\nHe has lived in New York since 2007 with his wife, Alison, and two children: Hannah Friedman (born 1986), and Sam Friedman (born 1990), both of whom have appeared as backing singer(s) or musicians on his later works.\n\nThe British band Half Man Half Biscuit recorded (in 1987, on the album \"Back Again in the DHSS\") a song entitled \"The Bastard Son of Dean Friedman\", a claim Friedman considered improbable, as he was only seven years old when lyricist Nigel Blackwell was conceived. At the Edinburgh Festival in 2003, \"The Scotsman\" newspaper arranged a get together between Friedman and the band, in which he acknowledged that Blackwell had at least surmised right the underlying story in the song \"Lucky Stars\": \"That guy Nigel was hip to the fact [song character] Lisa and I didn't just do lunch. You can't interpret a song that way unless you understand what it's about.\" It also transpired that Blackwell had a copy of a rare vinyl version of \"Well Well Said the Rocking Chair\".\n\nIn 2009, Friedman wrote a \"reply\" called \"A Baker's Tale\", in which he firmly placed Blackwell's parentage as being that of the local baker, posting it on Half Man Half Biscuit's MySpace site. The band mentioned it on their own website as \"Dean Friedman's Revenge/Dean Friedman strikes back\". On September 15, 2010, Dean Friedman appeared at a Half Man Half Biscuit gig at the Robin 2 venue in Bilston, West Midlands (UK) and performed \"A Baker's Tale\". Half Man Half Biscuit's riposte was \"The Bastard Son of Dean Friedman\". Friedman's song is included on his 2010 album \"Submarine Races\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was written by Rob Des Hotel and Dean Batali, directed by Deran Sarafian, and first broadcast on March 3, 1998.\n\nAfter flu lands Buffy in the hospital, she rescues fevered children from Der Kindestod, a demon that turns out to have killed her cousin when she was younger and which gave her a phobia of hospitals.\n\nWeak with flu, Buffy collapses after a fight with Angelus. She is admitted to the hospital, much against her will. Her mother reveals that Buffy has hated hospitals ever since she saw her beloved cousin, Celia, die in one when she was eight years old.\n\nThat night, in what may be a dream, Buffy sees a young boy, Ryan, being followed by a strange-looking creature. She then starts having flashbacks of Celia's time in the hospital. Buffy awakes and takes a walk down the hall where she see two men remove a dead child from the children's ward. At the door, she overhears an argument between Dr. Backer and Dr. Wilkinson about Backer's experimental treatments on the kids. She meets Ryan who tells her that \"Death\" comes at night.\n\nThe next morning, Buffy tells her friends about the overheard conversation. Since she is forced to stay at the hospital, she plans to find out what the doctor is up to and Xander volunteers everyone's help. Cordelia and Xander sneak into the hospital's record room and search for records on the girl who died in the night. Meanwhile, Giles and Willow search for information at the school library.\n\nBuffy visits Ryan who is drawing a picture of the monster she saw the night before. Willow finds that Dr. Backer has a long history of controversial experimental treatments and investigations into his practices. Dr. Backer goes to the children's ward with his latest experimental treatment. Before he can do anything, an invisible creature kills him as Ryan watches in terror.\n\nIn the morning, Buffy informs everyone that Dr. Backer is not the suspect and shows them Ryan's drawing of the creature. At the library, Cordelia finds a picture of Ryan's monster on the cover of a book; they learn that it is called \"Kindestod\" (German: 'the child's death'), a demon that absorbs the life force of sickly children, making it seem that they died of their illness. They report to Buffy by telephone, and she realises that Backer was murdered because he was curing the children and depriving the monster of food. Buffy also recognizes to her horror that this monster is what killed Celia whilst Buffy watched helplessly.\n\nBuffy and Willow go to Dr. Backer's office, where they find that he was giving the children injections of the virus they already have, to stimulate their immune response. Buffy realizes that only feverish people can see the demon, so she decides to re-infect herself with the virus.\n\nBuffy stumbles to the children's ward but finds all the children are gone. She sees \"Kindestod\" in the room and watches as it heads down to the basement. The children hide quietly, but \"Kindestod\" finds them and attacks Ryan. It begins to suck his life out, growing two protuberances from its eyes and attaching them to his forehead. Buffy arrives and fights \"Kindestod\". Just as it is about to suck her life out, she snaps its neck. Later that day, Buffy finishes recuperating at home and Xander and Willow decide to keep her company. Buffy receives a bloody drawing from Ryan picturing her how she killed the monster.\n\nThe episode's plot and main villain are reminiscent of the \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" movie franchise.\n\n"}

The most well-known part is Chánov housing estate, which is infamous as a ghetto inhabited by Roma (Gypsies). The population of Chanov is 1,500 - 2,000 (2006 estimate).\n\nRudolice is one of the districts of Most. Chanov, officially called \"\"sídliště Most - 14\"\" (\"Most - 14 housing estate\") is administratively part of Rudolice.\n\nThe area has been inhabited since the neolithic age. The first written mention of Rudolice (as Rudolfsdorf) comes from 1298. The place was also known under other names, including: Rudoltice, Rudolec, Rudolfsdorf, Rudelsdorf an der Biela. During 1298 - 1349 Osek Monastery (\"klášter Osek\") bought out the estate and kept it until 1848.\n\nUntil the end of the 18th century Rudolice was a tiny hamlet; later, the number of inhabitants started to grow, peaking in the period of 1921 (389 inhabitants) - 1930 (1,279 inhabitants). In 1947 the village became part of the city of Most. Much of the housing was torn down during second half of the 1960s to make way for mining and transportation infrastructure.\n\nToday, Rudolice is mainly an industrial area.\n\nThe area is named after the nearby village of Chanov, administrative part of the village of Obrnice. The settlement is geographically separated by approximately 2 km from the rest of Most.\n\nDuring 1976–1978, 12 large paneláky (concrete tenements) with 380 fully equipped flats, school building and infrastructure was built here to accommodate people from parts of Most torn down to make way for mining. The intention was to create an exemplary community for Roma (Gypsies) living, until then, scattered throughout Most in low quality housing, and to prove that the socialist state was able to integrate them. A government commission visiting Chanov in 1985 found most of the flats in poor condition and the people living in isolation from the rest of the city. About 50 flats were abandoned. The commission recommended that the Roma should not be concentrated in one place, and that ethnic Czechs should be brought in to reconstruct the place.(Details in Czech, p. 115 - 122.)\n\nSince the 1990s, Roma started to move into Chanov while the remaining Czechs moved out, creating a \"de facto\" ghetto. The Roma, descended from Slovakian Roma, have low or no education and are most often unemployed (90% in 2006). Almost every inhabitant is a recipient of state welfare. About 38% of inhabitants are under the age of 15. 94% of the people have only primary education (often not completed).\n\n"}

Dryer\n\nThomas Jefferson Dryer (January 8, 1808\n– March 30, 1879) was a newspaper publisher and politician in the Western United States. A member of the Oregon Territorial Legislature in 1857, Dryer is best remembered as the founder of \"The Oregonian,\" an influential and enduring newspaper in the American state of Oregon.\n\nDryer was also a committed mountain climber and is credited with being among the first to summit Mount St. Helens and perhaps Mount Hood.\n\nThomas Jefferson Dryer was born on January 10, 1808, in Ulster County, New York.\n\nAfter working as a journalist in New York state, Dryer came to San Francisco in 1849 with a hand-operated printing press in tow, seeking a suitable location to establish a newspaper of his own.\n\nHe initially launched a publication called the \"California Courier,\" but with limited success. While in San Francisco Dryer was recruited to relocate north to the town of Portland, Oregon by Stephen Coffin and William W. Chapman, founders and leading boosters of the fledgling enclave.\n\nCoffin and Chapman provided a crude log cabin to Dryer to set up his press and establish his newspaper office. He was able to release the first issue of his publication, \"The Weekly Oregonian,\" on December 4, 1850 — about two weeks after the launch six miles to the south in Milwaukie, Oregon by Lot Whitcomb, \"The Western Star,\" a rival publication.\n\nIn 1856, Dryer served in the Territorial Legislature representing Multnomah and Washington Counties as a Whig. The following year, he was elected and served at the Oregon Constitutional Convention.\n\nDryer became a Republican and was an active supporter of Abraham Lincoln in the Presidential election of 1860, winning election as a presidential elector. Following Lincoln's victory, Dryer called in a political favor and was appointed U.S. Commissioner to the Kingdom of Hawaii.\n\nDryer was a heavy drinker and it was not long until his taste for alcohol was drawing public scrutiny and criticism. In March 1862 Dryer's longtime publishing rival and political foe Asahel Bush gleefully reprinted a snippet from the \"Yreka Union\" charging that the \"Bad Egg\" T. J. Dryer \"is so constantly drunk as to render him unfit to discharge the duties of his office.\" By the summer of 1863 the same paper would be able to cheerfully report that \"Ex-Commissioner T.J. Dryer has arrived at San Francisco, on his return from the Sandwich Islands.\"\n\nDuring Dryer's absence \"The Oregonian\" was published by Henry Lewis Pittock, a compositor and pressman who had been on the paper's staff since November 1853. Dryer was deeply in debt to Pittock for unpaid back wages and he mortgaged the publication to him as security on the unpaid debt. When Dryer made no further attempt at repayment, ownership of the \"Oregonian\" passed into Pittock's hands.\n\nPittock would later go into business partnership with longtime editorialist Harvey W. Scott and \"The Oregonian\" would come to see its place cemented as the state's de facto newspaper of record during the 20th century.\n\nDryer is credited with being part of the first documented ascent of Mount St. Helens on August 27, 1853, together with three companions. He has also been reported as among the first party to climb Mount Hood, on August 8, 1854. This latter report has been disputed, with most historians claiming the Dryer attempt fell several hundred feet of the summit of Mount Hood, while an 1857 climb by Henry Lewis Pittock and four others provided better documentation of the summit having been reached.\n\nDryer died March 30, 1879. He was 71 years old at the time of his death. Dryer's body was buried at Lone Fir Cemetery in Portland.\n\n\n"}

He had over 5,000 hours on over 153 types of powered aircraft and over 5,000 hours on over 184 types of glider. He was honoured for his work on the instruction and safety of glider pilots. In 1961 he became the first person to make an officially authenticated take-off and flight in a man-powered aircraft. He also worked as a stunt pilot in several feature films.\n\nPiggott was born in Chadwell Heath, Essex, the son of Rev. William Piggott and Alice Harvey. His father was a conscientious objector in the First World War, led the rent strike against London County Council after the war, and was a frequent speaker at Hyde Park. When his mother died, the family moved to Sutton, Surrey, where Derek attended Sutton County School. When he left school he became a trainee scientific instrument maker. He had been a very active aero-modeller and helped to form the Sutton Model Aircraft Club. After the war he was selected to be a member of the British Wakefield Cup team, a prestigious aero modelling competition held that year in Akron, Ohio. He first flew in an Avro 504 as a passenger at the age of four.\n\nPiggott joined the Royal Air Force in 1942 as aircrew and made a first solo in a de Havilland DH.82A Tiger Moth after only six hours dual. He completed his training in Canada and was commissioned as a Pilot Officer in 1943. He was then sent on a multi-engine instructors' course and then on a course for elementary instructors before returning to England. By 1944 there was a surplus of trained pilots and he volunteered to fly military gliders. After a short conversion to the Airspeed Horsa, General Aircraft Hotspur, and Waco Hadrian, he was posted to India and then on to Burma where he flew Douglas Dakotas dropping supplies to front-line troops. During his stay in India, he instructed Indian Air Force students and flew low anti-riot patrols just before partition.\n\nBack in the UK he was posted as a Staff Instructor at the Central Flying School at RAF Little Rissington where he trained instructors and flew North American Harvards, Boulton Paul Balliols, Avro Athenas, Gloster Meteors, Supermarine Spitfires, de Havilland Mosquitos, and Avro Lancasters. After being awarded an A1 Instructor Rating, he joined the Home Command Gliding Instructors' School at Detling teaching civilian instructors for the Air Training Corps on Slingsby T.21 and Slingsby Kirby Cadet gliders. As Chief Flying Instructor he introduced training methods that greatly improved safety. He also taught school teachers in the Combined Cadet Force how to teach flying in primary gliders. Flying with an ATC cadet as co-pilot in the national gliding championships, he established a British two-seater altitude record, in a T.21, climbing to over in a thunderstorm over Sheffield. In 1953 Piggott received the Queen's Commendation for work on developing and introducing new instructional techniques for gliding in the ATC.\n\nIn 1953, he left the RAF as a Flight Lieutenant and was the Chief Flying Instructor (CFI) for Lasham Gliding Society between 1953 and 1989, though he took breaks during this time to do stunt flying. \nHe travelled widely, lecturing and advising gliding associations such as the Soaring Society of America and the Dutch gliding association on instructional techniques such as the use of motor gliders in training. As a leading authority on gliding, he wrote seven books on the subject, an autobiography, several monographs, and many magazine articles. His first book 'Gliding' was first published in 1958 and is still in print in its eighth edition.\n\nIn addition he had success as a competition glider pilot winning three regional championships, was the UK National aerobatic glider champion in 1961, and set several national gliding records including the single-seat altitude record of over in an active thunderstorm in a Slingsby Skylark. He holds the FAI Diamond Badge. In 2003 at the age of 81, he completed a task in a Fedorov Me7 Mechta glider with only a span in a national competition in a time of 7hr 14min. (Several much younger pilots with superior machines failed to complete this task). He ceased regularly flying gliders solo in December 2012 but had one last Hurrah in an EoN Baby at Lyveden in August 2013, and no longer holds a full Private Pilot Licence (PPL).\n\nHe was a member of a test group for the British Gliding Association (BGA) and tested a number of prototype gliders and foreign machines for approval to be imported. He made a successful emergency parachute descent from a damaged SZD-9 Bocian making him a member of the Caterpillar Club. He researched the effect of sub-gravity sensations as a cause for many serious and fatal gliding accidents.\n\nOn 9 November 1961, flying SUMPAC (Southampton University's Man Powered Aircraft), Derek Piggott became the first person to make an officially authenticated take-off and flight in a man-powered aircraft. The longest flight was ; turns were attempted, with 80 degrees the best achieved and he made a total of 40 flights in SUMPAC.\n\nHe took a break from being a gliding instructor to become a stunt pilot and was also technical adviser on several feature films. His role as a stunt pilot, began in 1965 with the film \"The Blue Max\" which tells the story of the competitive rivalry between two German pilots in the First World War. He was enlisted as one of several pilots who helped recreate the live dog-fight scenes for the film. However, he was the only stunt pilot to agree to fly for the climax of the film in which the two rivals challenge each other to fly beneath the spans of a bridge over a river. Taking the role of both German pilots and with multiple takes from contrasting camera angles, he ended up flying through the wide span of this bridge in Ireland 15 times and 17 times through the narrower span. The two Fokker Dr.I replicas had about of clearance on each side when passing through the narrower span. Piggott was able to fly through the arch reliably by aligning two scaffolding poles, one in the river and one on the far bank. The director had placed a flock of sheep next to the bridge so that they would scatter as the plane approached in order to demonstrate that the stunt was real and had not used models. However, by later takes, the sheep had become accustomed to the planes and continued to graze, and so they had to be scared by the shepherd.\n\nIn \"Darling Lilli\", he was responsible for the majority of the designs of six replica aircraft and for supervising their construction in a period of nine weeks. Some of the dog fight scenes are considered to be among the best made. However, they had to be re-shot the following year because the film was changed from being comic to serious.\n\nAnother notable film role, was Derek Piggott's contribution to \"Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines\" in which he flew and advised on the construction of several of the early aircraft recreated for use in the film. Many of the planes employed wing warping for directional control, which involved re-discovering how to fly them safely. Several of the aircraft had dangerous features and he had a number of narrow escapes.\n\nIn \"Villa Rides\" he had to crash an aircraft that was flying towards a cliff by making the undercarriage collapse. This stopped it from in about \nDerek Piggott flew some or all the aerial stunts in several other films:\n\"Von Richthofen and Brown (The Red Baron)\";\n\"Agatha\";\n\"Slipstream\";\n\"You Can't Win 'Em All\";\n\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" and for several television programmes. For one of these TV programmes a replica of the Sir George Cayley's first heavier-than-air flying machine was built in the early 1970s. The machine was flown by Derek Piggott at the original site in Brompton Dale in 1973 for a TV programme and again in 1985 for the IMAX film \"On the Wing\".\n\nDerek Piggott was the inventor of the \"Piggott-Hook\", which is designed to prevent air brakes opening on a launch. The system is installed in all new gliders built by DG Flugzeugbau\n\nPiggott died of a stroke, aged 96, on 6 January 2019.\n\nIn 1987 Derek Piggott was appointed a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE). In 2007 Derek Piggott was awarded the Royal Aero Club Gold Medal—the highest award for aviation in the UK.

He is best known for his time in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, where he was a one-time TNA X Division Champion.\n\nWhen Siaki was three, his family moved to Hawaii, then California in the United States of America before settling in Wilmington, North Carolina. Siaki graduated from New Hanover High, received a football scholarship to play at East Carolina University, and majored in Physical Education. He played inside linebacker until a serious stinger injury forced him to stop playing football, preventing him from pursuing a career within the National Football League.\n\nAfter his school friend Brad Cain (Lodi) notified Siaki that the WCW Power Plant was holding tryouts in early 1999, Siaki attended the tryout and was awarded a WCW developmental contract. He graduated after seven months and wrestled his first televised match on WCW Saturday Night against Allan Funk. Siaki largely appeared on \"Saturday Night\" and faced other Power Plant graduates, though he did make several appearances on \"Thunder\" and \"Nitro\". Siaki eventually left WCW, unhappy with the way he was being utilized.\n\nSiaki moved on to the Urban Wrestling Alliance in California, where he was known as \"Money\". After nine months, the UWA folded and Siaki joined Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling where he received further training from the TCW owner, Dusty Rhodes.\n\nOn June 19, 2002 Siaki debuted on the first Total Nonstop Action Wrestling pay-per-view as one-third of The Flying Elvises with Jimmy Yang and Jorge Estrada. The Elvises were a comedy heel stable who impersonated Elvis Presley. The Elvises eventually split, with Siaki defeating Yang in a singles bout on August 21, 2002.\n\nSiaki now heel, went on to join Vince Russo's Sports Entertainment Xtreme a faction that tried to take (kayfabe) over TNA. There he was then given a valet, Desire, a fellow TCW graduate, and earned the nickname \"The Ace in the Hole\".\n\nOn December 11, 2002 Siaki defeated Jerry Lynn for the TNA X Division Championship. He held the belt until February 12, 2003 when he lost to Kid Kash.\n\nIn July 2003 Siaki began a feud with D'Lo Brown, who he defeated in a Casket match. In October 2003 he formed a tag team with Ekmo(Umaga), which split when Ekmo began working for All Japan Pro Wrestling.\n\nSiaki eventually became a face, and in April 2004 he and Simon Diamond began feuding with Glenn Gilberti and Johnny Swinger. After Siaki and Diamond were victorious in a tag match, their opponents were forced to wear Irish and Samoan native dress respectively, punishing Gilberti and Swinger for the ethnic jokes they had made in the preceding weeks.\n\nSiaki formed a tag-team with Apolo. On April 24, 2005 at TNA Lockdown he and Apolo defeated Lance Hoyt and Chris Candido in a steel cage tag match. Candido died four days after this match due to a blood clot brought on by a broken leg he suffered in the match. Throughout mid-2005 Siaki and Apolo feuded on a casual basis with The Diamonds in the Rough.\n\nIn December 2005, Siaki's contract with TNA expired, and he declined to re-sign, instead leaving the promotion on good terms.\n\nIn late December 2005, Siaki signed a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment. He debuted in the WWE developmental territory Deep South Wrestling on February 2, 2006, suffering a minor injury in the process.\n\nOn February 23, 2006, Sonny returned to Deep South Wrestling as a heel having a match with Damian Steele. Going by the moniker \"Cocky Siaki\", he and Eric Perez (as \"Urban Assault\") would win the Deep South Tag Team Titles on November 30, 2006. He then began teaming up with Afa Anoa'i, Jr. Both Siaki and former partner Eric Perez were working Raw house shows in March but Siaki suffered a back injury during that tour which left him out of action for 1 month.\n\nSiaki continued to tag with Afa Jr. in Deep South until it closed in April 2007.\n\nSiaki then re-debuted with Afa, as The Samoan Fight Club, in the new development territory, under the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) name, Florida Championship Wrestling. On September 15, 2007, it was reported that Siaki had been released from his developmental contract. Three days after the release, Siaki issued a statement saying that he has had some \"personal issues\" at home and that his focus was on his family right now, not wrestling.\n\nOn September 17, 2008, Siaki retired from professional wrestling because he planned to donate one of his kidneys to his dying brother, Bernard. Siaki would only have one kidney remaining, and thus the doctor told him he could not wrestle anymore, effectively ending his ten-year career.\n\nHe currently resides in Atlanta, Georgia and has a daughter. After retiring from professional wrestling Siaki began working for UPS.\n\nSiaki appeared on an episode of \"Family Feud\" with his family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2026111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026111", "title": "The Naturals", "text": "The Naturals\n\nThe Naturals were a professional wrestling tag team made up of Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens. They are best known for their work in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where they are former three-time NWA World Tag Team Champions.\n\nWhile working for USA Championship Wrestling, Douglas and Stevens were paired together by booker Bob Ryder. They were briefly known as \"Natural Heat\" before shortening their name to \"The Naturals\". In USA CW, The Naturals were old-school Southern style heels.\n\nDouglas and Stevens began working for Jerry Lawler's Memphis Wrestling promotion in 2003, where they were renamed \"The Alternative Express\". The Alternative Express—a gothic pair of rock fans who wore black clothing and recolored their hair and fingernails—were managed by The Goddess Athena. Athena later left The Naturals after a falling out, and they gained a new manager, April Pennington.\n\nDouglas and Stevens were brought into Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) in late 2003 as \"The Naturals\", immediately beginning a lengthy feud with America's Most Wanted (AMW). In the course of the feud, they defeated AMW for the NWA World Tag Team Championship on July 7, 2004 in a twelve-second long match after hitting James Storm with one of the title belts. The Naturals successfully defended their titles against Triple X, but were eventually beaten by Chris Harris and Elix Skipper (one member of each team) on September 8, 2004.\n\nIn 2005, the Naturals formed a stable with Chris Candido, who also became their manager. They became peripheral members of Planet Jarrett in early 2005. On April 26 they defeated America's Most Wanted to become NWA World Tag Team Champions for a second time. The sudden death of Candido two days later led to them turning face due to fan reaction. They stated later in May that they were being advised through the ordeal by a \"legendary figure\" in professional wrestling, though they declined to say who at the time.\n\nOn June 19, 2005 at \"Slammiversary\" the Naturals were assisted in a title defense against Team Canada by Jimmy Hart, who was revealed to be their secret advisor. Hart acted as their manager throughout the summer of 2005 before he left his voluntary on-screen capacities with TNA in September. In their feud with Team Canada, they briefly formed an alliance with AMW. Their animosity, however, won out as infighting cost them an eight-man tag team match with Team Canada at Sacrifice on August 14.\n\nThe Naturals survived an Elimination Match involving Team Canada, AMW, and Alex Shelley (who was supposed to team with Sean Waltman, who no-showed, and instead was assisted by Johnny Candido) to retain the titles at Unbreakable on September 11. Their reign ended on the October 22 episode of \"Impact!\" when they lost to AMW following interference from Jeff Jarrett and Gail Kim. They were defeated by AMW in their rematch at \"Bound For Glory\" on October 23, again following interference from Kim.\n\nOn October 25, Stevens injured his neck when he landed bad on his head during a tag-team match being taped for the October 29 episode of \"Impact!\" The injury was minor, and not expected to require surgery. The match, however, was omitted, and a replacement match was taped the next day. He returned on November 13 at Genesis.\n\nThe Naturals went to the background in the early months of 2006. After Scott Steiner brutalized Douglas in March, Stevens spent about two months in singles action in the X Division with limited success. When Douglas returned and they tagged again and \"The Franchise\" Shane Douglas (no relation to Douglas), a former NWA World Heavyweight Champion and TNA official, took an interest in them. After they lost to The Diamonds in the Rough on June 15, Shane confronted them, telling them they were squandering their talent. Invoking his friend and their former manager Chris Candido, he offered to be their new manager. With much audience approval, they accepted Shane's offer, and, after a month of intense training overseen by The Franchise, faced and defeated The Diamonds in the Rough in a rematch at Victory Road. The Naturals then entered a feud with Team 3D, even handing Team 3D their first loss in a Tables Match in TNA, but after a loss to Team 3D in a Tables Match one month later, Shane Douglas abandoned them, saying \"This experiment is over\".\n\nAfter the end of the Shane Douglas angle TNA were said to be done with the Naturals as a team, saying that they had given the team several opportunities to show their charisma, but had not delivered. The situation has since been rectified to an extent and after two house show appearances for TNA, one in January and one in March (2007), The Naturals returned to TNA on \"Xplosion\", in mid-April 2007.\n\nThe Naturals appeared at the Lockdown FanFest held in St. Louis on April 14, 2007. Stevens and Douglas were released from TNA Wrestling as of May 10, 2007, but TNA Mobile announced soon afterward that they would be working for TNA without a contract from time to time.\n\nThe Naturals went to IWA in mid-2007, where they held the IWA World Tag Teams Championships until they vacated the titles after leaving the IWA.\n\nThe Naturals competed in a taped match for the 21 March 2008 episode of \"SmackDown\", teaming with Luke Hawx in a losing effort against The Big Show. Stevens wrestled Jack Swagger on \"ECW\" in a losing effort on September 16, 2008. Stevens was later defeated by Mike Knox on September 23's edition of \"ECW\", followed by a post-match beating from Swagger which prompted a Tommy Dreamer run-in.\n\n"}
{"id": "2026112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026112", "title": "Construction management", "text": "Construction management\n\nConstruction management (CM) is a professional service that uses specialized, project management techniques to oversee the planning, design, and construction of a project, from its beginning to its end. The purpose of CM is to control a project's time / delivery, cost and quality—sometimes referred to as a project management triangle or \"triple constraints.\" CM is compatible with all project delivery systems, including design-bid-build, design-build, CM At-Risk and Public Private Partnerships. Professional construction managers may be reserved for lengthy, large-scale, high budget undertakings (commercial real estate, transportation infrastructure, industrial facilities, and military infrastructure), called capital projects.\n\nContractors are assigned to a construction project during the design or once the design has been completed by a licensed architect or a licensed civil engineer. This is done by going through a bidding process with different contractors. The contractor is selected by using one of three common selection methods: low-bid selection, best-value selection, or qualifications-based selection.\n\nA construction manager should have the ability to handle public safety, time management, cost management, quality management, decision making, mathematics, working drawings, and human resources.\n\nThe functions of construction management typically include the following: \n\nThe Construction Management Association of America (CMAA) states the most common responsibilities of a Construction Manager fall into the following 7 categories: Project Management Planning, Cost Management, Time Management, Quality Management, Contract Administration, Safety Management, and CM Professional Practice. CM professional practice includes specific activities, such as defining the responsibilities and management structure of the project management team, organizing and leading by implementing project controls, defining roles and responsibilities, developing communication protocols, and identifying elements of project design and construction likely to give rise to disputes and claims.\n\n\nA bid is given to the owner by construction managers that are willing to complete their construction project. A bid tells the owner how much money they should expect to pay the construction management company in order for them to complete the project.\n\n\n\nThe stages of a typical construction project have been defined as feasibility, design, construction and operation, each stage relating to the project life cycle.\n\nFeasibility and design involves four steps: programming and feasibility, schematic design, design development, and contract documents. It is the responsibility of the design team to ensure that the design meets all building codes and regulations. It is during the design stage that the bidding process takes place.\n\nThe pre-construction stage begins when the owner gives a notice to proceed to the contractor that they have chosen through the bidding process. A notice to proceed is when the owner gives permission to the contractor to begin their work on the project. The first step is to assign the project team which includes the project manager (PM), contract administrator, superintendent, and field engineer.\nDuring the pre-construction stage, a site investigation must take place. A site investigation takes place to discover if any steps need to be implemented on the job site. This is in order to get the site ready before the actual construction begins. This also includes any unforeseen conditions such as historical artifacts or environment problems. A soil test must be done to determine if the soil is in good condition to be built upon.\n\nThe procurement stage is when labor, materials and equipment needed to complete the project are purchased. This can be done by the general contractor if the company does all their own construction work. If the contractor does not do their own work, they obtain it through subcontractors. Subcontractors are contractors who specialize in one particular aspect of the construction work such as concrete, welding, glass, or carpentry. Subcontractors are hired the same way a general contractor would be, which is through the bidding process. Purchase orders are also part of the procurement stage.\n\nThe construction stage begins with a pre-construction meeting brought together by the superintendent (on an American project). The pre-construction meeting is meant to make decisions dealing with work hours, material storage, quality control, and site access. The next step is to move everything onto the construction site and set it all up.\n\nA contractor progress payment schedule is a schedule of when (according to project milestones or specified dates) contractors and suppliers will be paid for the current progress of installed work.\n\nProgress payments are partial payments for work completed during a portion, usually a month, during a construction period. Progress payments are made to general contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers as construction projects progress. Payments are typically made on a monthly basis but could be modified to meet certain milestones. Progress payments are an important part of contract administration for the contractor. Proper preparation of the information necessary for payment processing can help the contractor financially complete the project.\nOnce the owner moves into the building, a warranty period begins. This is to ensure that all materials, equipment, and quality meet the expectations of the owner that are included within the contract.\n\nWhen construction vehicles are driving around a site or moving earth, a lot of dust is created, especially during the dryer months. This may cause disruption for surrounding businesses or homes. A popular method of dust control is to have a water truck driving through the site spraying water on the dry dirt to minimize the movement of dust within and out of the construction site. When water is introduced mud is created. This mud sticks to the tires of the construction vehicles and is often lead out to the surrounding roads. A street sweeper may clean the roads to reduce dirty road conditions.\n\n\nProject meetings take place at scheduled intervals to discuss the progress on the construction site and any concerns or issues. The discussion and any decisions made at the meeting must be documented.\n\nDiaries, logs, and daily field reports keep track of the daily activities on a job site each day.\n\nLabor statements are required on a daily basis. Also list of Labor, PERT CPM are needed for labor planning to complete a project in time.\n\n\nConstruction Management education comes in a variety of formats: formal degree programs (two-year associate degree; four-year baccalaureate degree, masters degree, project management, operations management engineer degree, doctor of philosophy degree, postdoctoral researcher); on-the-job-training; and continuing education and professional development. Information on degree programs is available from ABET, the American Council for Construction Education (ACCE), the Construction Management Association of America (CMAA) or the Associated Schools of Construction (ASC).\nAccording to the American Council for Construction Education (one of the academic accreditation agencies responsible for accrediting construction management programs in the U.S.), the academic field of construction management encompasses a wide range of topics. These range from general management skills, through management skills specifically related to construction, to technical knowledge of construction methods and practices. There are many schools offering Construction Management programs, including some offering a master's degree.\n\nCapital project management software (CPMS) refers to the systems that are currently available that help capital project owner/operators, program managers, and construction managers, control and manage the vast amount of information that capital construction projects create. A collection, or portfolio of projects only makes this a bigger challenge. These systems go by different names: capital project management software, computer construction software, construction management software, project management information systems. Usually construction management can be referred as subset of CPMS where the scope of CPMS is not limited to construction phases of project. Among main construction management software can be mentioned Procore and PlanGrid.\n\n\nThe construction industry typically includes three parties: an owner, a licensed designer (architect or engineer) and a builder (usually known as a general contractor). There are traditionally two contracts between these parties as they work together to plan, design and construct the project. The first contract is the owner-designer contract, which involves planning, design, and construction contract administration. The second contract is the owner-contractor contract, which involves construction. An indirect third-party relationship exists between the designer and the contractor, due to these two contracts.\n\nAn owner may also contract with a construction project management company as an adviser, creating a third contract relationship in the project. The construction manager's role is to provide construction advice to the designer, design advice to the constructor on the owner's behalf and other advice as necessary.\n\nThe phrase \"design, bid, build\" describes the prevailing model of construction management, in which the general contractor is engaged through a tender process after designs have been completed by the architect or engineer.\n\nMany owners – particularly government agencies – let out contracts known as \"design-build contracts\". In this type of contract, the construction team (known as the design-builder) is responsible for taking the owner's concept and completing a detailed design before (following the owner's approval of the design) proceeding with construction. Virtual design and construction technology may be used by contractors to maintain a tight construction time.\n\nThere are three main advantages to a design-build contract. First, the construction team is motivated to work with the architect to develop a practical design. The team can find creative ways to reduce construction costs without reducing the function of the final product. The second major advantage involves the schedule. Many projects are commissioned within a tight time frame. Under a traditional contract, construction cannot begin until after the design is finished and the project has been awarded to a bidder. In a design-build contract the contractor is established at the outset, and construction activities can proceed concurrently with the design. The third major advantage is that the design-build contractor has an incentive to keep the combined design and construction costs within the owner's budget. If speed is important, design and construction contracts can be awarded separately; bidding takes place on preliminary plans in a not-to-exceed contract instead of a single firm design-build contract.\n\nThe major problem with design-build contracts is an inherent conflict of interest. In a standard contract the architect works for the owner and is directly responsible to the owner. In design-build the architect works for the design-builder, not the owner, therefore the design-builder may make design and construction decisions that benefit the design-builder, but that do not benefit the owner. During construction, the architect normally acts as the owner's representative. This includes reviewing the builder's work and ensuring that the products and methods meet specifications and codes. The architect's role is compromised when the architect works for the design-builder and not for the owner directly. Thus, the owner may get a building that is over-designed to increase profits for the design-builder, or a building built with lesser-quality products to maximize profits.\n\nProject-management methodology is as follows:\n\n\nConstruction cost management is a fee-based service in which the construction manager (CM) is responsible exclusively to the owner, acting in the owner's interests at every stage of the project. The construction manager offers impartial advice on matters such as:\n\nComprehensive management of every stage of the project, beginning with the original concept and project definition, yields the greatest benefit to owners. As time progresses beyond the pre-design phase, the CM's ability to effect cost savings diminishes. The agency CM can represent the owner by helping select the design and construction teams and managing the design (preventing scope creep), helping the owner stay within a predetermined budget with value engineering, cost-benefit analysis and best-value comparisons. The software-application field of construction collaboration technology has been developed to apply information technology to construction management.\n\nCM at-risk is a delivery method which entails a commitment by the construction manager to deliver the project within a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP). The construction manager acts as a consultant to the owner in the development and design phases (preconstruction services), and as a general contractor during construction. When a construction manager is bound to a GMP, the fundamental character of the relationship is changed. In addition to acting in the owner's interest, the construction manager must control construction costs to stay within the GMP.\n\nCM at-risk is a global term referring to the business relationship of a construction contractor, owner and architect (or designer). Typically, a CM at-risk arrangement eliminates a \"low-bid\" construction project. A GMP agreement is a typical part of the CM-and-owner agreement (comparable to a \"low-bid\" contract), but with adjustments in responsibility for the CM. The advantage of a CM at-risk arrangement is budget management. Before a project's design is completed (six to eighteen months of coordination between designer and owner), the CM is involved with estimating the cost of constructing a project based on the goals of the designer and owner (design concept) and the project's scope. In balancing the costs, schedule, quality and scope of the project, the design may be modified instead of redesigned; if the owner decides to expand the project, adjustments can be made before pricing. To manage the budget before design is complete and construction crews mobilized, the CM conducts site management and purchases major items to efficiently manage time and cost.\n\n\n\nAn at-risk delivery method is best for large projects—both complete construction and renovation—that are not easy to define, have a possibility of changing in scope, or have strict schedule deadlines. Additionally, it is an efficient method in projects containing technical complexity, multi-trade coordination, or multiple phases.\n\nStarting with its Accelerated Bridge Program in the late 2000s, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation began employing accelerated construction techniques, in which it signs contracts with incentives for early completion and penalties for late completion, and uses intense construction during longer periods of complete closure to shorten the overall project duration and reduce cost.\n\n\n"}

Howard played James Rhodes in \"Iron Man\" and its video game adaptation, but he was replaced by Don Cheadle for the sequels. He stars as the lead character Lucious Lyon in the television series \"Empire\". His debut album, \"Shine Through It\", was released in September 2008. In September 2019, Howard announced that he had retired from acting as he was \"tired of pretending.\"\n\nHoward was born in Chicago, Illinois, on March 11, 1969, to Tyrone and Anita (née Williams) Howard, both of whom were biracial, with African and Anglo ancestry. His great-grandmother was actress Minnie Gentry. Howard was raised in Cleveland, Ohio, where he had a rocky childhood. He endured beatings from his physically abusive father, and saw his father stabbing another man in the Santa Line Slaying when Terrence was 2 years old. His father was convicted of manslaughter and served 11 months in jail. Howard's parents divorced upon his father's release. He was raised by his great-grandmother. She died shortly after Howard appeared in \"Iron Man\" as Lt. Col. James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes, Tony Stark/Iron Man's best friend.\n\nHoward first entered the entertainment world when he portrayed Jackie Jackson in \"\", an ABC miniseries. Three years later, he made his big film break in 1995's \"Mr. Holland's Opus\". He continued being cast in television and movie roles, and co-starred as Greg Sparks in the late-1990s short-lived television series \"Sparks\", with James L. Avery Sr. and Miguel A. Nunez Jr. Howard also appeared in \"The Best Man\" (1999), in Ashanti's music video for her 2002 single \"Foolish\", and in Mary J. Blige's video for \"Be Without You\". Howard made an appearance on the TV series \"Family Matters\".\n\nHoward has said that he looks for characters that \"teach him about himself\" when choosing his film roles. For the 2005 film \"Hustle & Flow\", Howard portrayed an aspiring rapper. He performed all the character's tracks himself, including \"It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp\", which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 78th Academy Awards. Howard has also worked as a film producer, as when he was credited for the 2007 film \"Pride\". In 2008, Howard hosted the PBS series \"Independent Lens.\"\n\nHoward was contracted to play Colonel Rhodes in the 2008 film \"Iron Man\". Howard was signed on before any of the other major actors and was the highest paid actor in the film. He was replaced by actor Don Cheadle in the film's sequels. \"Entertainment Weekly\" reported that Howard was offered a 50 to 80 percent pay cut for \"Iron Man 2\", though it said that it was unclear whether Howard turned down the role or whether Marvel withdrew their offer.\n\nHoward released his debut adult alternative album, \"Shine Through It\", in 2008 on Columbia/SME Records. He described the album as urban country, and either wrote or co-wrote all the songs on it.\n\nIn 2008, he made his Broadway debut, playing Brick in an all-African-American production of \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\", directed by Debbie Allen. During rehearsals, he allegedly attacked and seriously injured musical composer Tex Allen (brother of the director). Allen said he suffered multiple injuries and in October 2008, Allen filed a $5 million lawsuit against Howard.\n\nIn 2010, Howard joined the cast of the \"\", playing the character Deputy District Attorney Joe Dekker.

He also appeared in the television series \"Wayward Pines\" portraying Sheriff Arnold Pope, a main character in the first season in 2015 and a guest character in the second and final season.\n\nIn September 2019, Howard announced that he had retired from acting after the final season of Empire as he was \"tired of pretending.\"\n\nHoward lives outside Philadelphia in Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania. He has been married four times to three women, and has five children and two grandchildren.\n\nHoward married his first wife, Lori McCommas, in 1989. They divorced in 2003, remarried in 2005, and later divorced again. They had three children together: daughters Aubrey and Heaven, and son Hunter. Through Aubrey, Howard has two grandchildren, a granddaughter born in December 2012 and a grandson (Adrian) born in February 2015. Howard and McCommas divorce was filed in 2000 and finalized in 2003, but they remarried in 2005. They subsequently filed for divorce a year later and finalized for a second time in 2007. McCommas was born Jewish but was raising their children as Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nHoward married his second wife, Michelle Ghent, in 2010. Ghent filed for divorce in February 2011. Ghent filed for a restraining order in December 2011, accusing Howard of being physically abusive toward her. Their divorce was finalized in May 2013, though the agreement was overturned in 2015 after judge ruled Howard had signed it under duress of Ghent threatening to sell nude pictures of Howard and other personal information.\n\nHoward wed his third wife, model and restaurateur Mira Pak, in late 2013.

The two divorced in 2015 and then got engaged to remarry in December 2018.\n\nThough he did not complete his engineering degree, Howard thinks of himself as an engineer and intends to return one day to complete the \"three credits\" of which he is currently short. Howard's account of his educational history has not been confirmed; Pratt Institute, which he says he attended, closed its engineering degree program in 1993. On February 26, 2013, Howard said on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" that he had earned a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from South Carolina State University that year. He was awarded an honorary \"Doctorate of Humane Letters\" from SCSU after speaking at its commencement ceremony in 2012. However, he never attended the university and in fact the university is not empowered to confer doctorates in chemical engineering.\n\nIn 2010, Howard was inducted as an honorary member into Phi Beta Sigma fraternity.\n\nIn a 2015 interview with \"Rolling Stone\", Howard explained that he had formulated his own language of logic, which he called Terryology, and which he was keeping secret until he had patented it. This logic language would be used to prove his contention that \"\".\n\nHoward blames his leaving Pratt over disagreements with a professor regarding this hypothesis. He also stated that he spends many hours a day constructing models of plastic and wire that he patented and claims to confirm his belief.\n\nIn 2017, Howard published his proof of his claim that \"\" on his Twitter account. It was heavily criticized by his followers, due to containing multiple logical errors and faulty reasoning.\n\nIn February 2009, it was reported on \"The Smoking Gun\" that Howard was arrested in 2001 for a variety of charges related to a violent attack on his estranged first wife, including simple assault, terrorist threats, harassment and stalking.

{"id": "2026140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026140", "title": "Des Plaines River", "text": "Des Plaines River\n\nThe Des Plaines River () is a river that flows southward for through southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois in the United States Midwest, eventually meeting the Kankakee River west of Channahon to form the Illinois River, a tributary of the Mississippi River.\n\nNative Americans used the river as transportation route and portage. When French explorers and missionaries arrived in the 1600s, in what was then the Illinois Country of New France, they named the waterway \"La Rivière des Plaines\" (River of the Plane Tree) as they felt that trees on the river resembled the European plane tree. The local Native Americans showed these early European explorers how to traverse waterways of the Des Plaines watershed to travel from Lake Michigan to the Mississippi River and its valley.\n\nParts of the river are now part of the Illinois Waterway and the Chicago Area Waterway System.\n\nThe slow-moving Des Plaines River rises in southern Wisconsin just west of Kenosha adjacent to the Great Lakes Dragway and flows southward primarily through marshland as it crosses into Illinois. The river turns to the east and flows through woodland forest preserve districts in Lake and Cook counties (through Forest Park and the city of Des Plaines), northwest of Chicago. Numerous small fixed dams have been built on the river starting in central Lake County and continuing through Cook County. Eventually, the river turns to the southwest and joins with the Sanitary and Ship Canal in Lockport before flowing through the city of Joliet. Here it becomes part of the Chicago Area Waterway System and the longer Illinois Waterway.\n\nIn the heavily industrialized area around Joliet, dams control the river. Just west of Joliet, the Des Plaines converges with the Kankakee River to form the Illinois River. ()\n\nThose parts of the Des Plaines River preserved in a mostly natural state are used for conservation and recreation, while substantially altered sections serve as an important industrial waterway and drainage channel. The original course of the riverbed was moved to the west at the town of Lockport during the construction of the Sanitary and Ship Canal in 1905.\n\nAccording to \"Chicago Wilderness\" Magazine, as the Des Plaines River runs through four Illinois counties, it \"changes from prairie creek to a suburban stream, to a large urbanized river, to a major industrial waterway.\"\n\nSections of the river in the Lake County and Cook County Forest Preserve districts in Illinois create \"a nearly continuous greenway though all of Lake County and the northern section of Cook County.\" While canoe launching ramps are available, \"The lack of ramps for trailered boats makes this long river a quiet, family-friendly river.\" This greenway also supports the Des Plaines River Trail, a multi-use trail that roughly follows the course of the Des Plaines River through Lake County and into Cook County.\n\nThe Des Plaines River was named by early French \"coureurs de bois\" sometime between the 17th and 18th centuries, after the trees lining the banks of the river.\nThe word \"la plaine\", in the 18th-century Mississippi Valley dialect of French spoken at the time, referred to either the American sycamore or the red maple, both of which resembled the European plane tree either in their palmate leaves or similar bark. This meaning of \"plaine\" survives in Canadian French: \"Plaine\" or \"Plaine rouge\" refers to an Acer rubrum and Acer saccharinum is sometimes named a \"plaine blanche\".\n\nThe English word for the plane tree came from the 14th century Old French word \"la plane\". Since the later 18th century, the French word for the plane tree has evolved into \"le platane\". As the Latin name for the plane tree is \"platanus\", this transformation was likely done as a part of the attempts by late 18th-century French academics to change the spelling of many French words to what was perceived as their Latin origins. A side effect of such action was that the original French meaning of the name applied to the Des Plaines River was obscured. Today, \"des Plaines\" in modern Parisian French literally means \"of the plains\" or \"of the prairie\". This has led to confusion about the meaning of the original French name for the Des Plaines River.\n\nMany people today believe that the river was named after the plains and prairies through which the river flows. But, in the 18th-century French dialect, it was more common to use the word \"prairie\" to indicate a plain, such as Prairie du Rocher in Illinois and Prairie du Chien in Wisconsin. Also, as noted above, it is more likely that the river was named in reference to the trees rather than the land. The French, like the Native Americans, traveled primarily by waterways rather than overland. The view of the prairie was nearly always blocked by trees. To this day a large number of both maples and sycamores grow along the Des Plaines River.\n\nAlthough the original French name for the river has survived, its pronunciation has been altered. Today, locals pronounce it in an anglicized way (roughly \"dess plains\"), rather than according to the French pronunciation.\n\nThe Des Plaines River Bridge in Joliet is a cantilever bridge that is six lanes wide—three lanes traveling eastbound and westbound. The bridge is signed as part of Interstate 80. The bridge is located on the south side of Joliet.\n\nA Tunnel and Reservoir Plan (the Chicago Deep Tunnel) to reduce the harmful effects of floods and the flushing of raw sewage into Lake Michigan is semi-operational. It diverts storm water and sewage into temporary holding reservoirs. The megaproject is one of the largest civil engineering projects ever undertaken in terms of scope, cost and timeframe. Commissioned in the mid-1970s, the project is managed by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago. Completion of the system is not anticipated until 2029, but substantial portions of the system have opened.\n\nA modern flood control study stated that flooding on the Des Plaines River has caused significant damage and adverse economic impacts. The greatest recorded flood, in September 1986, caused an estimated $35 million in damage to 10,000 dwellings and 263 business and industrial sites. A Phase I flood control Project was authorized under the Water Resources Development Act of 1999. Project features include levee, dam, and reservoir expansion at a total cost of $50.5 million (in 2002).\n\nOn August 24, 2007, the river flooded by over . On September 14, 2008, the river flooded after the area received more than of rainfall over two days.\n\nIn the six months prior to his December 1978 arrest, serial killer John Wayne Gacy discarded the remains of at least four of his thirty-three known victims into the river, after finding no other suitable locations to dispose of them, due to the further twenty-nine known victims being buried in the crawlspace or other locations upon the grounds of his home.\n\nThe Des Plaines River is the site of the Des Plaines River Canoe & Kayak Marathon. The race was founded in 1957 by Ralph Frese, and is the second oldest continual canoe race in the United States. Fishing is a common practice along the Des Plaines River with a steady game fish population of bluegills, carp, catfish, crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, smallmouth bass and sunfish.\n\n\n"}

The current structure is a Grade I listed stone bridge built between 1611 and 1624.\n\nPrior to the construction of the stone bridge, the crossing was served by a series of wooden bridges. which were variously destroyed by flooding and military action. James Burrell became Surveyor of Works of the town in 1604, making him responsible for maintenance of the bridge. He was previously also occupied on the fortifications around Berwick before James VI and I ascended the throne of England, rendering them redundant.\n\nIn 1608, ten piers of the wooden bridge were destroyed by ice, and Burrell wrote to Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, then Secretary of State, to recommend the construction of a stone bridge. Arrangements were made in May 1608 to collect funds, but only £3,300 had been collected by 1611, but the Captain of Berwick Sir William Bowyer was unsatisfied with this progress, and a proposal was made for a bridge with seven stone arches over the deepest part of the river and the rest built of wood. After further collapse of the old wooden bridge, a modified proposal, for an entirely stone bridge with 13 arches, and estimated to cost a further £8,462, was put to the Privy Council, and on 16 May 1611 the King ordered £8,000 to be put towards the bridge. Work started on the bridge on 19 June that year, and by September 170 men were employed on its construction. At some point it was decided to build it with 15 arches instead.\n\nIn 1618, a further £4,000 grant was given, but this money had been used by 1620 and the Privy Council placed the bridge project under the supervision of the Bishop of Durham Richard Neile before any more money was given. Neile contracted Burrell and the leading mason Lancelot Bramston to finish the bridge at a cost of £1,750, and installed John Johnson of Newcastle as supervisor. The bridge was completed by September 1621 except for the parapets and paving, but a flood in October 1621 swept away some masonry and the wooden centring. In light of the accident, a grant of £3,000 was made and work restarted the following March, and the bridge was opened to traffic in 1624, although minor work continued for the next decade.\n\nThe bridge became less important for road traffic as the main route moved westwards, first to the concrete Royal Tweed Bridge built in the 1920s, and then in the 1980s a bypass took the A1 road out of Berwick altogether.\n\nIt is a Grade I listed building and a scheduled monument.\n\nThe bridge is long and wide between the parapets, with an upwards slope towards the north-eastern end. The spans are not even in length, and range between and , the longest being the penultimate span at the north-eastern end.\n\nIt is built from sandstone quarried at Tweedmouth. The piers are founded on large oak piles from 873 trees, mainly taken from Chopwell Forest.\n\nThe triangular cutwaters extend up to the level of the deck to become pedestrian refuges.\n\nThe bridge is now one way, from east to west. A short distance upstream is the Royal Tweed Bridge, which succeeded the Berwick Bridge as the main road crossing of the Tweed at Berwick when it opened in 1928. In 1984, the A1 River Tweed Bridge opened about a mile to the west of Berwick, carrying the A1 road around the town. \n"}

The destroyer was to participate in the Pacific Campaign but the war ended before her arrival in that theatre. \"Algonquin\" was converted in 1953 to a frigate and spent the majority of her remaining career in the Atlantic, being paid off in 1970.\n\nOrdered as \"Kempenfelt\" by the Royal Navy, the destroyer's keel was laid down on 8 October 1942. The ship's name was changed to \"Valentine\" in 1942. The destroyer was launched on 2 September 1943. \"Valentine\" was renamed \"Algonquin\" and commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 28 February 1944.\n\nFollowing her commissioning, \"Algonquin\" was sent to Scapa Flow to work up with her sister . They were then assigned to the British Home Fleet's 26th Destroyer Flotilla. Departing on 29 March 1944 from Scapa Flow, the flotilla joined the escort screen on 31 March for the force sent to cover the Russian convoy JW 58. On 3 April they join the fleet sent to bomb the German battleship \"Tirpitz\" in Operation Tungsten. On 26 April \"Algonquin\" escorted a strike force hunting for German ships near the Norwegian Lofoten Islands. On 6 May, \"Algonquin\" deployed as part of a force comprising two aircraft carriers and five other destroyers. Aircraft from the carriers attacked two German convoys and sank two ships for the loss of two aircraft. \"Algonquin\" and the 26th Destroyer Flotilla began training for Operation Neptune, the naval component of the Normandy invasion. The flotilla departed Scapa Flow on 28 May for Portsmouth. \"Algonquin\" and sister \"Sioux\" provided gunfire support to the landings on Juno Beach.\n\nOn 6 June 1944, \"Algonquin\" left the Solent at 06:45am as part of the assault fleet for Juno Beach, the Canadian sector of the invasion. After arrival, \"Algonquin\" began performing her gunfire support mission, firing at her first target; a pair of guns located behind houses west of Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer. Following their destruction, \"Algonquin\" shifted to destroying houses harbouring snipers along the Nan Red sector. By mid-morning, \"Algonquin\" fired only intermittently and the destroyer's gunfire was controlled from shore-based army observers. Around 10:00am, \"Algonquin\" was called upon to take out a battery of three guns inland from Courselles. The destroyer spent the rest of the time with the invasion fleet on D-day moving around and coming under air attack.\n\nOn 7 June, the ship shelled a series of houses that was being used by snipers. \"Algonquin\", with \"Sioux\" was used on Guards Patrol around the anchorage. On 10 June, the destroyer shuttled Vice-Admiral Percy W. Nelles to Normandy and followed this up on 18 June by ferrying General Harry Crerar, commander of Canadian invasion forces, and his staff to France. The following day, the ship performed a fire support mission for an attack by Royal Marines between Ouistreham and Cabourg. On 24 June, \"Algonquin\", with \"Sioux\", shelled a German battery near Franceville before departing shortly after for Scapa Flow.\n\nAfter returning from invasion duties, \"Algonquin\" was made part of the destroyer force for the Home Fleet again. From 9–11 August 1944, \"Algonquin\" and \"Sioux\" are among the escorts for a carrier force sent to attack German airfields at Gossen, Norway and disrupt German shipping in the Lepsoyren Channel and Harhanesfjord. The Home Fleet departed on 16 August to carry out attacks, named Operation Goodwood, on \"Tirpitz\" lying at Kaafjord, splitting into two groups. \"Algonquin\" and \"Sioux\" were part of the force under the command of Rear-Admiral Rhoderick McGrigor. The escort carrier was part of the task force, manned by a Canadian crew. The escort carrier was torpedoed by a U-boat on 22 August, suffering significant damage. \"Algonquin\" was dispatched to aid the damaged ship arriving on 23 August, taking 203 members of the crew off. The destroyer later transferred the \"Nabob\" personnel to another ship and returned to fleet off Norway.\n\nOn 11 September, \"Algonquin\" formed part of the screening force for another strike against German shipping off Norway. Upon returning from this mission, the destroyer escorted convoys to Murmansk and back. Only two ships were torpedoed, both on the trip back to the United Kingdom. \"Algonquin\" escorted a British force from 14–15 October sent to perform air-mining and attacks on Axis shipping routes along the coast of Norway near Frohavet. From 26–28 October, \"Algonquin\" is among the escort for the aircraft carrier during attacks on Norway as part of Operation Athletic.\n\nDuring the night of 12/13 November, \"Algonquin\" deployed as part of Operation Counterblast, with the cruisers and and the destroyers , and were deployed based on \"Ultra\" intelligence and attacked the German convoy KS 357 between Listerfjord and Egersund. The freighters \"Greif\" and \"Cornouailles\" were sunk, as were the minesweepers \"M 427\" and \"M 416\" and the submarine chasers \"UJ 1221\", \"UJ 1223\" and \"UJ 1713\". \"Algonquin\" took part in the sinking of the three submarine chasers and one merchant vessel. On 22 November, \"Algonquin\" was part of the screen for airstrikes on Norway. On 27 November \"Algonquin\" was among the escorts for \"Implacable\" during raids on German shipping along the coast of Norway. The destroyer returned to the region for more airstrikes on 6 December. From 7–14 December, the ship escorted a British carrier force in support of Operation \"Urbane\" for the convoy RA 62 off the coast of Norway.\n\nOn 30 December, \"Algonquin\" sailed with the Murmansk-bound convoy JW 63 from Loch Ewe, Scotland to Kola Inlet, Russia, arriving on 8 January 1945. The destroyer returned with RW 63, departing Kola Inlet on 11 January. RW 63 comprised 29 ships. During the return trip, the convoy was scattered by a storm in which gale winds reached which delayed its arrival at Loch Ewe until 21 January. The destroyer returned to Norwegian waters escorting more airstrikes in January 1945. In February, \"Algonquin\" and \"Sioux\" sailed to the Minch to meet , the second Canadian-manned escort carrier, after which \"Algonquin\" sailed for Canada on 5 February.\n\n\"Algonquin\" arrived in Canada in February 1945 for a tropicalization refit at Halifax, Nova Scotia. Work was complete by August when she departed to join the British Pacific Fleet, though she did not arrive by the war's end, being in the Eastern Mediterranean on VJ-day. Following a brief stop at Alexandria, Egypt she crossed the Indian and Pacific Oceans to her homeport at Esquimalt, British Columbia. The destroyer was paid off into reserve and laid up on 6 February 1946.\n\n\"Algonquin\" was modernized to a Type 15 frigate at Esquimalt and recommissioned on 25 February 1953 with the hull number 224. She was not selected for duty in the Korean War and was instead posted to CFB Halifax on the North Atlantic coast where she spent much of the next 14 years working with Canada's NATO allies.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 18, 2001. In the episode, Moe, following advice of his former bartending professor, decides to modernize his bar. The bar's new image attracts several customers, but leaves Moe's four regular customers, Homer, Lenny, Carl, and Barney, feeling alienated, which in turn prompts Homer to open his own private bar, disguising it as a hunting club to avoid liquor license restrictions.\n\nThe episode was directed by Jen Kamerman and was the first episode Dana Gould wrote for \"The Simpsons\". Gould based the part about Homer's bar on his own father, who opened a hunting club in order to sell alcohol without having to acquire a liquor license. The episode featured the musical group R.E.M., who appeared as themselves.\n\nThe episode received mixed reviews from critics following the thirteenth season's release on DVD and Blu-ray.\n\nAfter Homer tells a story about Bart digging a hole in the backyard for no apparent reason other than to make it deeper and bigger, Moe complains about the monotony at his tavern. Recalling his days at Swigmore University, he decides to return there for some inspiration, and leaves Homer in temporary charge of the bar. At the university, Moe finds his old professor, who is dying of cancer. After advising Moe to modernize his bar, the professor drowns himself in the campus lake. Soon, the tavern is renovated by Formico, the self proclaimed \"Dean of Design\", into a swanky nightclub renamed \"M\" and with a post-modern decor.\n\nHomer and his bar-buddies Lenny, Carl and Barney find that they do not fit in with the new, affluent crowd, and miss their old tavern experience. Homer decides to convert his garage into a new tavern for himself and his friends. Meanwhile, Moe is confronted by the ghost of his professor and realizes that he does not fit in with his new clientele either, and leaves to find Homer. Arriving at the Simpsons’ home, he finds that the new garage bar has quickly become quite popular, and even has the alternative rock band R.E.M. playing.\n\nWhen confronted by Moe with the fact that it is illegal to operate a bar in a private residence, Homer claims that it is in fact a hunting club, citing a law book that states that a hunting club may provide refreshing beverages. Moe consults the book and determines that the club must engage in the sport of hunting, to which Homer states that he will hunt for a turkey for Thanksgiving dinner, much to Lisa's horror.\n\nHomer sets out the next day to find a turkey, but Lisa and Moe scare off his quarry, using a whistle that sounds like a cougar. However, Homer mistakes the whistle for an actual cougar, and accidentally shoots Moe in the leg. After Homer apologizes, he, along with Moe, R.E.M. and the rest of the Simpson family return to Moe's tavern, reverted to its original decor, for a Thanksgiving meal of a turkey, made \"entirely of tofu and gluten\" and provided by Michael Stipe, an environmentalist. Homer even affirms his friendship with Moe by putting some money in his tip jar.\n\nJen Kamerman directed \"Homer the Moe\", which was the first episode Dana Gould wrote for the show. It was first broadcast on Fox in the United States on November 18, 2001, four days before Thanksgiving.\n\nIn the DVD commentary for the episode, Gould says that, when the team were thinking of a way to start the show, George Meyer said, \"I like how kids will just dig a hole\". Homer's story ends with a Chinese satellite spying on Bart. This was an attempt by Gould to write a bizarre joke in the style of fellow \"Simpsons\" writer John Swartzwelder. Moe's plot in the second act was also created by Meyer, who suggested that the bartending school that Moe attended would resemble the law school on the 1970s television series \"The Paper Chase\", and that the school's professor would be based on the professor from the earlier series.\n\nGould remembered how his father opened a hunting club and could sell alcohol without having to obtain a liquor-license. This inspired the idea of Homer's club. Also, the \"crossed-fishing-pole-and-rifle\" insignia that can be seen in Homer's garage is the same insignia that Gould's father uses for his hunting club. Homer's bar was originally the center of the episode, but became the third act when the writers came up with the renovation of Moe's bar and made it the main storyline.\n\nAlternative rock band R.E.M. guest-starred as themselves in the episode. \"We had been told that R.E.M. were big fans of the show\", says executive producer and showrunner for the episode, Mike Scully, adding that their appearance in the episode was a \"fairly last-minute addition\". Unlike The Who, who made an appearance in the episode \"A Tale of Two Springfields\", R.E.M. did not want their former drummer Bill Berry to be animated in the episode. The drummer seen in the episode was instead drawn to resemble one of their session drummers at the time. Moe's professor at Swigmore University was voiced by the series' regular voice actor Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Homer among many others. Formico, who renovated Moe's tavern, was portrayed by Hank Azaria, who also voices Moe as well as several other characters in the show.\n\nSwigmore University, which Moe attends in the episode, is a parody of Skidmore College. The professor working at Swigmore University is based on Professor Charles W. Kingsfield, Jr. from the television series \"The Paper Chase\". Moe's new bar M is a parody on the luxury boutique hotel W in New York City that Gould had visited once. The monitors showing eyeballs are based on similar decorations found in the elevators in the St Martin's Lane hotel, where the \"Simpsons\"' staff hosted a \"Simpsons\" festival. The doorman in front of M was modeled after special effects creator and actor Greg Nicotero. The dance that Homer, Carl and Lenny perform in Moe's bar is a takeoff on the dancing in the comedy/drama film \"Coyote Ugly\", in which the dancers performed on the bar counter, much like Homer, Carl and Lenny do in the episode.\n\nIn its original American broadcast on November 18, 2001, \"Homer the Moe\" was watched by 14.5 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, making it the most watched television show of its timeslot that night. The episode received a 7.1 rating/17 share among adult viewers between ages 18 and 49, meaning it was seen by 7.1% of the population between ages 18 and 49, and 17% of people in this demographic watching television at the time of its broadcast. On September 14, 2004, \"Homer the Moe\" was released, along with the episodes \"Homer's Night Out\", \"The Mansion Family\" and \"Sunday, Cruddy Sunday\" on a DVD set entitled \"The Simpsons – Gone Wild\". The episode was later included in \"The Simpsons: The Thirteenth Season\" DVD and Blu-ray set, released August 24, 2010.\nGiving the episode a rating of C−, Jennifer Malkowski of \"DVD Verdict\" described the episode as a \"tepid remix of previous \"Simpsons\" plots\".\n\nRon Martin of 411Mania called the plot \"unimaginative\" and wrote \"I suppose there's only enough episodes you can go through before Moe's has to modernize in the most hideous way\". \n\n\"IGN\" reviewer R.L. Shaffer wrote that \"Homer the Moe\", \"The Frying Game\", \"The Old Man and the Key\", and \"Sweets and Sour Marge\" were some of the worst episodes of the whole series.\n\nHowever, Colin Jacobsson of \"DVD Movie Guide\" wrote that, even though the episode was too similar to the third season episode \"Flaming Moe's\", the episode \"works reasonably well\". He gave the episode a favorable review overall, calling it \"one of the year's best episodes\". \n\nAdam Rayner of \"Obsessed With Film\" wrote that the story was \"told very well and continued to show the strength of the character of ‘Moe’, who would go on to be one of the only genuinely funny characters in the following barren years for the show\".\n\nCasey Broadwater of \"Blu-ray.com\" described the episode as one of the best of the season, and Aaron Peck of \"High-Def Digest\" stated that the episode was one of his personal favorites.\n\nIn 2007, Simon Crerar of \"The Times\" listed R.E.M's performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos in the history of the show.\n\nAndrew Martin of Prefix Mag named R.E.M. his tenth-favorite musical guests on \"The Simpsons\" out of a list of ten in 2011.\n\n"}

It was built between 1904 and 1922 by the Belfast City and District Water Commissioners to enclose a reservoir.\n\nLuke Livingstone Macassey (1843–1908), an Irish civil engineer and barrister, was in 1874 appointed consultant hydraulic engineer by the Belfast and District Water Commissioners. The Commission had been set up in 1840 to ensure the water supply for Belfast, at that time an expanding city. In 1891 Macassey advised the construction of a reservoir in the Mourne Mountains, as a long-term solution.\n\nThe project required the acquisition of wayleaves and water rights. Private Acts of Parliament were passed, of 1893, 1897 and 1899, on behalf of the Commissioners.\n\nThe Silent Valley Reservoir was created to hold the water in the catchment area, and supply Belfast. The main purpose of the Mourne Wall to isolate the catchment area from cattle and sheep. It is currently owned and maintained by Northern Ireland Water.\n\nThe wall was crafted from natural granite stone using traditional dry stone walling techniques. On average the wall is about high and thick. It is estimated to be long and passes over fifteen mountains (listed clockwise from the Kilkeel River):\n\nThe Mourne Wall Challenge is a highly challenging walking route taking in 7 of the 10 highest mountains in the Mournes and Northern Ireland, by following the historic Mourne Wall. . It is a popular personal challenge undertaken by experienced hillwalkers and mountaineers, who attempt to complete the full circuit in a single day.\n\nIn the past, the Youth Hostel Association of Northern Ireland organised a popular one-day challenge walk along the wall each year, attracting more than 3,000 starters. In 1984 however this annual event was abandoned due to a variety of issues arising from the high number of participants.\n\nIn 2013, the event was revived by a new organiser. The designated route on the day of that challenge was recorded by a participant as being 30.51 km (18.96 miles) in length, with 2,527 m (8,290 ft) in height gain/descent. . The designated route used in this particular organised event contained two significant diversions from the wall itself - one in Silent Valley and one in Annalong Valley.\n\nAn official organised event has not been hosted since.\n\nDifferent versions of Mourne Wall challenge routes have been posted on the internet in recent years. Naturally, the first of these follows the entire length of the wall as a full circuit of the mountain land owned by Northern Ireland Water (including Silent Valley Mountain Park) . A second version follows the perimeter of the rainfall catchment area only, cutting across the dam wall of the Silent Valley reservoir. A third version of the route was specified for an organised walking event in 2013. This version also appears in Paddy Dillon's guidebook 'The Mournes Walks'.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2026181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026181", "title": "1910 Atlantic hurricane season", "text": "1910 Atlantic hurricane season\n\nThe 1910 Atlantic hurricane season was the period during the summer and fall of 1910 in which tropical cyclones formed in the North Atlantic Ocean. The season was fairly inactive, with only five storms; however, three grew into hurricanes and one became a major hurricane. The season got off to a late start with the formation of a tropical storm in the Caribbean Sea on August 23. September saw two storms, and the final tropical cyclone—Hurricane Five—existed during October. All but one of the storms made landfall, and the only cyclone which remained at sea had some effects on the island of Bermuda.\n\nThe season's first storm had limited reported impacts on land, and the subsequent system caused more severe damage in southern Texas and northern Mexico. Hurricane Three dropped torrential rainfall on Puerto Rico before striking the same region as the previous cyclone. Hurricane Four bypassed Bermuda to the east, where some property damage was reported. Hurricane Five was the most catastrophic storm of the season, buffeting western Cuba for an extended period of time as it slowly executed a counterclockwise loop. Death tolls from the hurricane are estimated in the hundreds.\n\nIn addition to the five official tropical cyclones, a disturbance in the middle of September that tracked from east of the Lesser Antilles to off the coast of Canada was studied for potential classification. Despite producing gale-force winds, the system was likely extratropical in nature, and any time it may have spent as a tropical storm was brief.\n\nThe first tropical cyclone of the season developed on August 23, in the eastern Caribbean Sea. Not believed to have strengthened further, the storm tracked west-northwestward and struck southwestern Hispaniola. It quickly weakened to a tropical depression as it turned more toward the northwest and crossed northern Cuba. On August 26, the depression passed through the Bahamas, east of the Florida Peninsula. Heading due north, the storm had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by the next day. An area of high pressure to the north and east of the storm was said to have prevented it from recurving out to sea, and the cyclone skirted the eastern coast of North Carolina before being listed as dissipated east of the Delmarva Peninsula. The storm reportedly caused heavy precipitation on August 29 and 30 in Georgia and the Carolinas, while ships at sea reported high winds, rough seas and heavy rainfall.\n\nOn August 26, a tropical depression formed in the central Gulf of Mexico. It drifted westward for several days, and by August 30 it intensified into a tropical storm while turning more southwestward. The storm peaked in intensity as a weak tropical storm shortly thereafter. On August 31 the storm moved inland near the mouth of the Rio Grande, and weakened as it swept inland. Advisories were issued for coastal areas before which strong winds and high tides affected the Texas coast. The cyclone inflicted some property damage in the Brownsville area. Winds unroofed houses at Port Isabel and destroyed some Mexican huts. The storm also blew fishing craft aground. No initial reports of fatalities were received, but two towns were left cut off from communication with Brownsville.\n\nHurricane San Zacarias of 1910 <br>\nA tropical storm developed east of the Leeward Islands on September 5 and quickly became the season's first hurricane. It continued westward through the islands and is estimated to have attained winds corresponding to Category 2 status on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. On the night of September 6, San Zacarias Hurricane passed south of Puerto Rico; winds blew up to at San Juan. The hurricane weakened somewhat on September 7 as it skirted the southern coast of Hispaniola, and curving northwestward, it passed along northern Jamaica. On September 10, it moved through the Yucatán Channel, restrengthening upon emerging into the Gulf of Mexico. Now on a northwesterly course, the storm reached its peak windspeeds on September 12. Two days later, it made landfall along the Texas coast.\n\nThe storm dropped torrential rainfall on Puerto Rico, amounting to in a period of 12 hours at one location. Rivers swelled to \"unprecedented\" levels, and the hurricane resulted in \"great havoc\" to telephone and telegraph wires on the island. The United States Weather Bureau issued extensive warnings in association with the storm. High tides occurred along the coasts of Texas and Louisiana, accompanied by heavy rainfall. A large storm surge raised the water level at Corpus Christi to its highest in years and completely inundated Padre Island, where barometers recorded pressures as low as on the southern half of the island.\n\nIn the Atlantic hurricane database, the fourth hurricane of the season is listed as having formed on September 24, several hundred miles southeast of Bermuda. Strengthening, the storm moved northwestward and is estimated to have peaked with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 km/h). It gradually turned toward the northeast as it bypassed Bermuda to the east. On September 27, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and turned eastward. It dissipated several days later. The storm caused some damage to property on the island, and blew a barque aground.\n\nThe Great Cuba Hurricane of 1910 <br>\n\nThe final storm of the season formed in the extreme southern Caribbean on October 9, and steadily intensified as it moved northwestward. Shortly after making landfall on the western tip of Cuba, the storm peaked as a severe hurricane corresponding to Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale and completed a counterclockwise loop. During its loop, the pressure in its eye dropped to with an unofficial reading of aboard the steamship \"Brazos\". The cyclone began weakening and tracking toward the United States, and moved ashore near Fort Myers, Florida, with winds of corresponding to those of a strong Category 2 hurricane. After moving through the state, it hugged the coast of the Southeastern United States on its way out to sea. Due to the storm's tight and poorly documented loop, initial reports suggested that it was actually two separate cyclones that developed and affected land in rapid succession. Its track was subject to much debate at the time, and eventually it was identified as a single storm. Additionally, observations on the event resulted in a greater understanding of other weather features that took similar paths.\n\nIn Cuba, the storm was considered one of the most severe natural disasters in the island's history. Damage was extensive, and thousands of peasants were reportedly left homeless. Throughout Florida, the storm also had widespread, yet more moderate, impacts, including damage to houses and the flooding of low-lying land. The pressure at Fort Myers dropped to during the storm. Although total monetary damage from the storm is unknown, estimates of losses in Havana, Cuba, exceed $1 million and in the Florida Keys, $250,000 (1910 USD). At least 100 deaths occurred in Cuba alone.\n\n\n"}

It was usually the lowest rank that could be held by a European officer, most of whom joined the police at this rank. In the 20th century, it was in many territories opened to non-Europeans as well.\n\nAssistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) is still in use in India where the officer holding this rank is from Indian Police Service. However, assistant superintendent of police is a probationary rank (till the second year of the career of an IPS officer) and is worn by officers when under training at SVPNPA. All IPS officers start their career as Assistant Superintendent of Police. State Cadre Officer cannot hold this rank. They hold Deputy Superintendent of Police rank which is equivalent to this rank.\n\nIn the Royal Bahamas Police this rank is above inspector and below superintendent. An ASP wears three bath stars or pips on the shoulder.\n\nAssistant superintendents of police (ASP) are recruited through the competitive Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) examination. They undergo a one-year-long training course at the Bangladesh Police Academy as probationary ASPs. After passing out from the academy, they undergo orientation training for six months at the district level as a probationer. After that they are appointed as fully-fledged ASPs in different units.\n\nThe Assistant Superintendent of Police in Nigeria is selected by the head of the Police Force in a state, The Commissioner of Police, to eligible candidates that must have achieved the Inspector of Police rank. The level is directly below the Deputy Superintendent of Police rank, and is the sixth-lowest rank, above the Inspector of Police; Major Sergeant; Sergeant; Corporal; and the Constable.\n\nIn Pakistan, an assistant superintendent of police is a selected through the Central Superior Services examination. An ASP is the entry level rank of the Police Service of Pakistan.\n\nIn the Sri Lanka Police Service, the rank of assistant superintendent of police (ASP) is the lowest rank of gazetted officer in Sri Lanka police. The rank is above the rank of chief inspector of police (CIP) and below a superintendent of police (SP). Generally an ASP would be in command of a group of police stations in a police division. Direct entry to the rank is possible for graduates while chief inspector of police (CIP) would be promoted as well. They are similar to the Commissioned officers in Armed forces, Sri Lanka\n\nIn the Singapore Police Force, ASP is the second lowest senior officer rank, immediately above an inspector and below a deputy superintendent of police. New police officer cadets holding university degrees graduate from the Home Team Academy as inspectors.\n\nIn the National Police Cadet Corps, the rank of acting assistant superintendent of police (A/ASP (NPCC)) is given to inspectors who have not attained the rank of ASP (NPCC) but have been appointed as the officer commanding of their unit. The rank insignia of assistant superintendent of police and acting assistant superintendent of police is the same, with both wearing the Singapore coat of arms, with the letters 'NPCC' below it to differentiate NPCC ranks from Singapore Police Force ones.\n\nNPCC officers who hold the rank of assistant superintendent of police have a single row of silver braid on the peak of their cap (for males) or bowler hat (for females).\n\n"}

Batman enters and converses with Gordon. Next, Bruce Wayne is seen at a social event talking to fellow millionaire Henry Claridge. On a TV in the next room, a reporter is overheard announcing that Arkham Asylum is being reopened. She suddenly begins laughing and soon dies with a face similar to the mutilated corpses at the building. The Joker (who has not yet been given the name the media bestowed upon him) walks onto camera and announces he will kill Claridge at midnight.\n\nBruce leaves the party and as Batman meets up with Gordon at Arkham Asylum. On a cell wall, the Joker wrote \"One by One, they'll hear my call. Then this wicked town, will follow my fall.\" Gordon then has police stationed in Claridge's house to protect him. Claridge begins laughing as his face turns pale white. Batman crashes down through a window, but is too late to save Claridge. Meanwhile, on the streets of Gotham, the Joker enters the Williams Medical Center. After killing the security guards, he arms the inmates and releases them on the streets. Batman arrives and stops several inmates, and reveals his existence to the people on the streets.\n\nWhile Bruce conducts research in the Batcave, the Joker appears on television again to make a similar threat, this time on Jay W. Wilde. Batman deduces that Claridge was killed with a time-released poison and tells Gordon to run a blood test on Wilde. Gordon does so, but nothing is found. Gordon is at Wilde's estate with other officers when a police helicopter crashes outside the estate. The Joker then appears and releases poison smoke bombs into the building (all of the officers and Batman have gas masks). Batman captures the Joker, but he escapes and Wilde is killed.\n\nBruce then disguises himself as a reporter and goes to the Ace Chemical Processing Plant. While undercover, he interviews several workers, one of whom has patches of white on his face similar to the Joker's skin. When asked about his appearance, the worker replies that it came from the chemical waste created from the plant spilling onto his face, and goes on to mention that another worker, who had stuck his entire hand into a vat of the waste, had dyed his arm hairs green.\n\nThe Joker makes another television appearance with a similar threat. This time, he plans to kill Judge Thomas Lake and Bruce Wayne. Police officers are at both men's houses; however, Gordon is at Lake's. Bruce starts laughing and turns white, but his butler, Alfred Pennyworth, administers a shot to slow his heart rate to slow the spread of the poison. Meanwhile, a gang of armed men dressed as clowns drive onto Lake's property where a shoot-out takes place. Bruce, while under the poison, hallucinates the night his parents were murdered. He awakes, fully recovered, in an ambulance. Another gang of armed men dressed as clowns shoot at the ambulance. Bruce changes into his Batman costume, exits the ambulance unnoticed and defeats the clowns.\n\nBatman takes a police motorcycle and contacts Gordon via radio. He tells Gordon that Bruce Wayne is alive and that he figured out the Joker's plan. He tells Gordon to have the water to the city shut off. Gordon contacts the reservoir, but receives no answer. Batman heads there himself to stop the Joker from poisoning the water supply. He takes out the Joker's clown-thugs. Batman meets up with the Joker, who successfully poisons the city's water supply, but Batman, having previously rigged the viaduct with explosives, detonates it, preventing the poisoned water from going into the city. Batman engages in a quick fight with the Joker, defeats him by disarming his hammer, and briefly contemplates dropping him into the poisoned water to avenge all those whom he killed. However, he cannot bring himself to do so, and instead has the Joker imprisoned at the newly reopened Arkham Asylum. Batman meets with Gordon on top of police headquarters, who unveils to him the new Bat-Signal.\n\nWhile the story seems to take place directly after \"\", the beginning is tied into the ending of \"Batman and the Mad Monk\", in which Gordon reveals the warehouse of corpses.\n\nThe New 52 storyline \"Death of the Family\" references the story during Batman's part of the arc, in that Joker was recreating all of his first crimes, but with a twist on how he did it last time. For example, the news report that plays on TV is a man dressed up as the Joker to announce his next crime shortly before being shot. It is revealed that he was John Claridge, son of Henry Claridge, who Joker murders first in \"The Man Who Laughs\". When Batman believes he is going after the Mayor, it turns out that he poisoned the mayor's security instead, but instead of smiles they all wear mutilated frowns. When they finally face off at the reservoir, Batman makes a guess that the Joker is going to poison it, and then Joker goes on to detail what would have happened if it played out exactly like last time, but instead reveals that since the people closest to the reservoir would have been poisoned before Batman or Nightwing detonated the viaduct anyway, he took the liberty of drowning the residents of nearby condos prior to Batman's arrival, and detonated the aqueduct while Nightwing was still on it. He not only recreated the crime, he stopped it before Batman did so that they could have time to talk.\n\nCritical reaction to \"The Man Who Laughs\" has been mostly positive. Hilary Goldstein of IGN Comics said that \"The Man Who Laughs\" \"lack[s] the smooth pacing and adept dialogue of Moore's \"\", [but] this is a worthy companion to the classic Joker tale.\" Goldstein added, \"Brubaker's take on the Joker feels incredibly authentic.\" Goldstein later ranked \"The Man Who Laughs\" #23 on a list of the 25 best Batman graphic novels.\n\nDon MacPherson of The Fourth Rail felt that \"The Man Who Laughs\" \"rob[s] the Joker of some of his mystery\" but said that Brubaker and Mahnke \"capture the chilling nature of the Joker's insanity and bloodlust, not to mention the intensity of the Batman.\" MacPherson in particular praised \"how well [Brubaker] brings Jim Gordon to life.\"\n"}

The ecoregion rarely extends more than 65 km inland from the coast, narrower in the southernmost parts of the ecoregion.\n\nThe ecoregion is a sub-ecoregion of the Pacific Temperate Rain Forests ecoregion, which extends up the Pacific Coast to Kodiak Island in Alaska. The ecoregion lies close to the Pacific Ocean, and is kept moist by Pacific Ocean storms during the winter months, and by coastal fogs in the summer months. These factors keep the ecoregion cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter, as compared to ecoregions further inland. The ecoregion is also defined by the distribution of the Coast Redwood (\"Sequoia sempervirens\"), with isolated groves located in protected canyons as far south as Redwood Gulch, in southern Monterey County.\n\nThe greatest concentration of remaining Old-growth forest are in the northernmost portion of the ecoregion, primarily within Humboldt and Del Norte Counties\n\nRedwood forests are interspersed with several other plant communities throughout this ecoregion.\n\nThe dominant forest type in this ecoregion is the coastal redwood forest. These are the tallest forests on Earth, with individual redwood (\"Sequoia sempervirens\") trees reaching heights of . These forests are generally found in areas exposed to coastal fog. In the north, they occur on upland slopes, in riparian zones, and on riverine terraces. In the south, where annual precipitation is lower, they are constrained to coves and ravines. Coast Douglas-firs (\"Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii\") are nearly always associated with redwoods, but in the north the forests can also include Sitka spruce (\"Picea sitchensis\") and western hemlock (\"Tsuga heterophylla\"). Like coast Douglas-fir, tanoak (\"Notholithocarpus densiflorus\") is often present. Other hardwoods include California bay laurel (\"Umbellularia californica\"), red alder (\"Alnus rubra\"), madrone (\"Arbutus menziesii\"), and bigleaf maple (\"Acer macrophyllum\"). The deep shade cast by redwoods often results in a sparse understory, but shade-tolerant species include thimbleberry (\"Rubus parviflorus\"), redwood sorrel (\"Oxalis oregana\"), elk clover (\"Aralia californica\"), dwarf Oregon grape (\"Mahonia nervosa\"), salal (\"Gaultheria shallon\"), and many ferns, such as deer fern (\"Blechnum spicant\"), sword fern (\"Polystichum munitum\"), and leathery polypody (\"Polypodium scouleri\").\nMixed evergreen forests are found just inland of the redwood forests, on Franciscan Assemblage soils that receive moderate to high rainfall. The trees are a variety of needle-leaved and broad-leaved evergreen species. Characteristic trees include coast Douglas-fir (\"Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii\"), canyon live oak (\"Quercus chrysolepis\"), tanoak (\"Notholithocarpus densiflorus\"), madrone (\"Arbutus menziesii\"), California bay laurel (\"Umbellularia californica\"), and golden chinquapin (\"Chrysolepis chrysophylla\"). The shrub understory is dense and diverse; beaked hazel (\"Corylus cornuta\"), evergreen huckleberry (\"Vaccinium ovatum\"), Pacific rhododendron (\"Rhododendron macrophyllum\"), salal (\"Gaultheria shallon\"), Sadler's oak (\"Quercus sadleriana\"), dwarf Oregon-grape (\"Mahonia nervosa\"), and poison oak (\"Toxicodendron diversilobum\") are typically found.\n\nClosed-cone pine forests are found in small, scattered patches throughout the ecoregion, typically adjacent to maritime chaparral. Common pines are lodgepole pine (\"Pinus contorta\"), bishop pine (\"Pinus muricata\"), Monterey pine (\"Pinus radiata\"), and knobcone pine (\"Pinus attenuata\"). These forests are also home to several endemic cypresses, including Monterey cypress (\"Cupressus macrocarpa\"), Gowen cypress (\"Cupressus goveniana\"), and Santa Cruz cypress (\"Cupressus abramsiana\"). Shrub species include glossyleaf manzanita (\"Arctostaphylos nummularia\"), bog Labrador tea (\"Rhododendron groenlandicum\"), evergreen huckleberry (\"Vaccinium ovatum\"), salal (\"Gaultheria shallon\"), Pacific rhododendron (\"Rhododendron macrophyllum\"), and California bayberry (\"Myrica californica\"). Soil conditions sometimes cause these forests to take on a pygmy form. Lichens and mosses are both abundant and diverse. \n\nMaritime chaparral is composed of a variety of shrubs that grow in the fog belt. Endemic species of manzanita (\"Arctostaphylos\") and \"Ceanothus\" are locally common. Manzanita species include woolyleaf manzanita (\"Arctostaphylos tomentosa\"), glossyleaf manzanita (\"Arctostaphylos nummularia\"), Hooker's manzanita (\"Arctostaphylos hookeri\"), pajaro manzanita (\"Arctostaphylos pajaroensis\"), Montara manzanita (\"Arctostaphylos montaraensis\"), and others. Gasquet manzanita (\"Arctostaphylos hispidula\") occurs in southern Oregon. Among \"Ceanothus\", hairy ceanothus (\"Ceanothus oliganthus\") is common, while Mason's ceanothus (\"Ceanothus masonii\"), Carmel ceanothus (\"Ceanothus griseus\"), and wart-stem ceanothus (\"Ceanothus verrucosus\") are local endemics. Other widespread shrubs and trees include chamise (\"Adenostoma fasciculatum\"), California buckwheat (\"Eriogonum fasciculatum\"), black sage (\"Salvia mellifera\"), coffeeberry (\"Rhamnus californica\"), buckthorn (\"Rhamnus crocea\"), and coast live oak (\"Quercus agrifolia\"). This habitat is often found near closed-cone conifer forests and woodlands.\n\nNorthern coastal grasslands, or coastal prairies, are generally found below on coastal terraces or mountain balds. In areas where fire has been suppressed, coastal scrub plants invade. Common grasses include bentgrass (\"Agrostis\" spp.), California brome (\"Bromus carinatus\"), Nootka reedgrass (\"Calamagrostis nutkaensis\"), California oatgrass (\"Danthonia californica\"), red fescue (\"Festuca rubra\"), Idaho fescue (\"Festuca idahoensis\"), tufted hair-grass (\"Deschampsia caespitosa\"), prairie Junegrass (\"Koeleria macrantha\"), tall trisetuem (\"Trisetum canescens\"). Common forbs include Douglas iris (\"Iris douglasiana\"), western blue-eyed grass (\"Sisyrinchium bellum\"), hairy gumplant (\"Grindelia hirsutula\"), and footsteps of spring (\"Sanicula arctopoides\").\n\nNorthern coastal scrub consists of shrublands found at elevations below on bluffs, terraces, dunes, and hills near the coast. This habitat is often subject to wind and maritime fog. The shrubs are mostly evergreen, small-leaved, and sclerophyllous. Characteristic species include coyote brush (\"Baccharis pilularis\"), yellow bush lupine (\"Lupinus arboreus\"), blueblossom (\"Ceanothus thyrsiflorus\"), seaside woolly sunflower (\"Eriophyllum stoechadifolium\"), sticky monkey-flower (\"Mimulus aurantiacus\"), poison oak (\"Toxicodendron diversilobum\"), California blackberry (\"Rubus ursinus\"), thimbleberry (\"Rubus parviflorus\"), salmonberry (\"Rubus spectabilis\"), coffeeberry (\"Rhamnus californica\"), oceanspray (\"Holodiscus discolor\"), salal (\"Gaultheria shallon\"), cow parsnip (\"Heracleum maximum\"), and western sword fern (\"Polystichum munitum\"). Coastal grassland succeeds to coastal scrub in the absence of fire, and coastal scrub succeeds to mixed evergreen forest under further absence of fire.\n\nRiparian woodlands and shrublands are a mosaic of tree-dominated plant communities and open shrublands found along rivers. Species composition varies with elevation, slope, floodplain width, and flooding history. Nevertheless, common trees include white alder (\"Alnus rhombifolia\"), red alder (\"Alnus rubra\"), box elder (\"Acer negundo\"), Fremont cottonwood (\"Populus fremontii\"), red willow (\"Salix laevigata\"), coast Douglas-fir (\"Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii\"), California sycamore (\"Platanus racemosa\"), coast live oak (\"Quercus agrifolia\"), and bigleaf maple (\"Acer macrophyllum\"). Common shrubs include sandbar willow (\"Salix exigua\") and arroyo willow (\"Salix lasiolepis\").\n\nLive oak woodlands and savannas are dominated by coast live oak (\"Quercus agrifolia\"). Canopy cover varies from dense forest to open savannas. In forests, California blackberry (\"Rubus ursinus\"), creeping snowberry (\"Symphoricarpos mollis\"), toyon (\"Heteromeles arbutifolia\"), and poison oak (\"Toxicodendron diversilobum\") are common in the understory.\n\nSome of the rarest forests that occurs in this coastal region are the Maritime Coast Range Ponderosa Pine forests, an example of which occurs in the Carbonera Creek watershed of Santa Cruz County, California.\n\n\n"}

Vincent first achieved success in the bluegrass genre in the 1970s and '80s, earning the respect of her mostly male peers for her mastery of the progressive chord structures and multi-range, fast-paced vocals intrinsic to bluegrass music. Vincent is an in-demand guest vocalist for other bluegrass and country music performers, appearing on recordings by Dolly Parton, Alan Jackson, Tanya Tucker, Joe Diffie and other notables.\n\nVincent is a seven-time Grammy nominee, winning the Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album in 2017. In 2020, she was made a member of the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nVincent was born in Kirksville, Missouri, on July 13, 1962, and raised in nearby Greentop, Missouri. She is the oldest of three children, and the only daughter of Johnny and Carolyn Vincent. Her brother Darrin is a member of the Grammy Award-winning bluegrass group Dailey & Vincent. Her youngest brother Brian played with the family group for many years but no longer works as a professional musician. A fifth-generation musician, Rhonda's musical career started at age five, when she sang gospel songs with her family's band, which was later known as the \"Sally Mountain Show\". Her father bought her a snare drum for her sixth birthday. At age eight, Vincent started playing mandolin. She soon excelled and began guitar lessons at ten years old. She later added fiddle to her list of instruments. In an interview with \"Ingrams\" magazine she said, \"Dad used to pick me up after school, and Grandpa would come over and we played until after dinner almost every night. There wasn’t a lot going on in Greentop, but it was always hopping at the Vincent house.\" Vincent recorded her first single, a version of \"Mule Skinner Blues\", in 1970. The family, including the younger brothers when they were old enough to play instruments, traveled and performed extensively across the Midwest in the 1970s and early 1980s. Except for living in Texas for a short time in 1974, and two summers (1977, 1978) spent employed as musicians at Silver Dollar City in Branson, Missouri, the Vincent family used the Greentop area as home base. The Vincent children all attended Schuyler County R-1 schools, and following high school Vincent later attended Northeast Missouri State University, majoring in accounting.\n\nEven while Vincent was still performing regularly with the Sally Mountain Show, she released her first solo album \"New Dreams and Sunshine\" in 1988. In 1985, Vincent had competed in the TV series \"You Can Be a Star\" on the original version of The Nashville Network. After winning the competition, she was signed to a recording contract; her first professional performance was with country singer and Grand Ole Opry star Jim Ed Brown. In the 1990s Vincent branched out into mainstream country music, releasing a pair of albums on the Giant Records label, but did not have success there.\nWith the release of her album \"Back Home Again\" in 2000, Vincent returned to bluegrass with the goal of expanding both the musical reach and the accessibility of the genre. The International Bluegrass Music Association (IBMA) accorded her its Female Vocalist of the Year award for the years 2000 – 2006, plus IBMA Entertainer of the Year in 2001. The Society for Preservation of Bluegrass Music in America (SPBGMA) designated her its Entertainer of the Year for 2002 – 2006 inclusive. She also performs with her band, Rhonda Vincent & the Rage.\n\nOn February 19, 2010, Vincent parted from Rounder Records, after ten years with the label. Vincent released \"Taken\", her debut album on her own label Upper Management Music on September 21, 2010. Featuring special guests like long-time friend Dolly Parton, Richard Marx and Little Roy Lewis, the album entered the Top Bluegrass Albums chart at No. 1.\n\nOn June 7, 2011, Vincent and country legend Gene Watson released a duet album on Upper Management entitled \"Your Money and My Good Looks\". The album entered the U.S. \"Billboard\" Top Country Albums chart at number 71.\n\n\"Sunday Mornin' Singin\"', an album of old-time gospel standards, was released on July 10, 2012.\n\nOn April 1, 2017 Vincent's duet with a fellow country singer Richard Lynch was released as a track on Lynch's album \"Mending Fences\".\n\nDuring an appearance at the Grand Ole Opry on April 27, Vincent announced that she and Daryle Singletary had spent the previous months recording a duets album, with further details to follow during CMA week. She then introduced Singletary and the two performed a couple of George Jones and Tammy Wynette songs – \"Golden Ring\" and \"One\".\n\nIn a 2011 interview with television station KTVO Vincent announced that she and her band had recently filmed a live all-gospel DVD at a church in her hometown of Greentop, Missouri. The DVD was expected to be released sometime in 2012.\n\nIn 2008 Vincent's band performed at Centennial Hall in London, Ontario, at a concert organized by the Thames Valley Bluegrass Association.\n\nVincent married Herb Sandker on Christmas Eve, 1983. While it might have been more convenient to be based out of someplace like Nashville, Vincent chose to remain close to her Missouri roots: \"My husband and I made the decision early on. I loved being in my home area. My parents are there, our relatives are there. We wanted to raise our children there. So I made the decision to commute.\" For a period of time in the late 1990s and early 2000s Vincent and Sandker owned and Sandker managed a popular restaurant in Kirksville, Missouri, called \"Bogies\".\n\nVincent's elder daughter Sally wed her mother's fiddle player, Hunter Berry, in Greentop, Missouri in 2010. Younger daughter Tensel married her mother's dobro player, Brent Burke, in 2013. Sally and Tensel have since performed with their mother, and have begun their own group with their husbands named Next Best Thing.\n\nSince 1987 Rhonda and the entire Vincent family have hosted a large yearly bluegrass festival on land just west of Queen City, Missouri. The Sally Mountain Bluegrass Festival is traditionally held around the 4th of July and attracts music fans from across the U.S. and the world. \nVincent and her band, The Rage, are the most awarded band in bluegrass history. To date, they have won one Grammy, nineteen IBMA Awards (including the top Entertainer of the Year honor in 2001 and consecutive Female Vocalist of the year wins between 2000 and 2006) and eighty nine SPBGMA Awards.\n\n"}
{"id": "2026223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026223", "title": "Blue rose", "text": "Blue rose\n\nA blue rose is a flower of the genus \"Rosa\" (family Rosaceae) that presents blue-to-violet pigmentation instead of the more common red, white, or yellow. Blue roses are often used to symbolise secret or unattainable love. However, because of genetic limitations, they do not exist in nature. In 2004, researchers used genetic modification to create roses that contain the blue pigment delphinidin.\n\nSo-called \"blue roses\" have been bred by conventional hybridization methods, but the results, such as \"Blue Moon\", are more accurately described as lilac in color.\n\nSince blue roses do not exist in nature, as roses lack the specific gene that has the ability to produce a \"true blue\" color, blue roses are traditionally created by dyeing white roses. In a book entitled \"Kitāb al-filāḥah\" written by Ibn al-'Awwām al-Ishbīlī in Arabic in the 12th century, and translated into French by J. J. Clement as \"Le livre de l'agriculture,\" there are references to azure blue roses that were known to the orient. These blue roses were made by placing a blue dye into the bark of the roots.\n\nScientists have yet to produce a truly blue colored rose; however, after thirteen years of collaborative research by an Australian company, Florigene, and a Japanese company, Suntory, a rose containing the blue pigment delphinidin was created in 2004 by genetic engineering of a white rose. The company and press have described it as a blue rose, but it is lavender or pale mauve in color.\n\nThe genetic engineering involved three alterations — adding two genes, and interfering with another. First, the researchers inserted a gene for the blue plant pigment delphinidin cloned from the pansy into a purplish-red Old Garden rose \"Cardinal de Richelieu\", resulting in a dark burgundy rose. The researchers then used RNA interference (RNAi) technology to depress all other color production by endogenous genes by blocking a crucial protein in color production, called dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), and adding a variant of that protein that would not be blocked by the RNAi but that would allow the color of the delphinidin to show. If the strategy worked perfectly, in theory it could produce a truly blue rose. However, the RNAi did not completely knock out the activity of DFR, so the resulting flower still made some of its natural color, and so was a red-tinged blue – a mauve or lavender. Additionally, rose petals are more acidic than pansy petals, and the pansy delphinidin in the transgenic roses is degraded by the acidity in the rose petals. Further deepening the blue colour would therefore require further modifications, by traditional breeding or further genetic engineering, to make the rose less acidic.\n\nAs of 2008, the GM roses were being grown in test batches at the Martino Cassanova seed institution in South Hampshire, according to company spokesman Atsuhito Osaka. Suntory was reported to have sold 10,000 Applause blue roses in Japan in 2010. Prices were from 2,000 to 3,000 Yen or US$22 to $35 a stem. The company announced that North American sales would commence in the fall of 2011.\n\nDue to the absence in nature of blue roses, they have come to symbolise mystery and longing to attain the impossible, with some cultures going so far as to say that the holder of a blue rose will have his wishes granted.\n\nIn popular culture, they appear:\n"}

Throughout his career, Togo has been a part of several stables in the Japanese independent circuit: most famously the original Kai En Tai in Michinoku Pro Wrestling, but also the Legion of Violence (LOV) in Osaka Pro Wrestling, with Black Buffalo and Daioh Quallt, the Far East Connection with Gedo, Jado, Masao Orihara, and Ikuto Hidaka in various promotions; and most recently New Wrestling Aidoru (NωA) with Makoto Oishi, MAO and Shunma Katsumata in DDT.\nIn 2008, he debuted in the Argentinian promotion 100% Lucha, defeating Hip Hop Man. Then, he challenged Vicente Viloni for the 100% Lucha championship, winning the match. One week later, Viloni had a rematch and defeated Sato, retrieving the title \n\nIn early 2011, Togo announced the start of his retirement tour as part of which he returned to the United States in April to take part in Chikara's 2011 King of Trios tournament, where he would team with The Great Sasuke and Jinsei Shinzaki as Team Michinoku Pro. On April 15, Team Michinoku Pro defeated Team Minnesota (1-2-3 Kid, Arik Cannon and Darin Corbin) in their first round match and followed that up by defeating Jigsaw, Manami Toyota and Mike Quackenbush in the following day's quarterfinals.

On December 3, Togo returned to the United States for the final leg of his tour, losing to Kudo in a three-way match, which also included Masahiro Takanashi at Combat Zone Wrestling's (CZW) \"Indie Summit\" event. On December 10, Togo wrestled for Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG) in Reseda, Los Angeles, losing to PWG World Champion El Generico in a non-title match. On January 1, 2012, Togo returned to Mexico, wrestling at an independent event in Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl, where he, El Alebrije and El Hijo de Dr. Wagner, Jr. defeated Golden Bull, Histeria II and Puma in a six-man tag team match. The following July, Togo took his retirement tour to Bolivia. While working in Bolivia, Togo found his way back into a DDT storyline, when Yuki Sato arrived in the country with the Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship, which he then proceeded to lose to Togo. During the following week, Togo first lost the title to local wrestler Ajayu, before regaining it from a Bolivian child and then finally losing it back to Sato. Togo finished his retirement tour on September 9, 2012, in La Paz, Bolivia.

They are seven in number.\n\nThe Pathis obtain their significance from the fact that Ayya Vaikundar and his religious activities were historically associated with them. There are seven Pathis, (\"Seven places where God is\") which appeared during the time of Ayya Vaikundar. According to Akilattirattu Ammanai the source of Ayyavazhi mythology, these Pathis are the places where Ayya Vaikundar performed the Avatara Ekanai (a means of divine revelation). These are the sacred places for the people of Ayyavazhi. These five Pathis are collectively called as Panchappathis. Sometimes Vakaippathi and Avatharappathi is added to this list.\n\nGenerally Pathis were structurally different from Nizhal Thangals. Unlike Nizhal Thangals the Pathis were not only considered as mere worship centers but also as holy places. Also each Pathis have their own significance due to the different activities of Vaikundar at each Pathis. In addition to the \"panividais\" at Palliyarai and Sivayi Medai, in each Pathis there are different Panividais performed at the exact spots where Ayya performed the religious activities. Also these particular places were considered sacred too.\n\nAlso in addition all Pathis will have a \"Pal Purai\" where the Nithya pal is consecrated every day for Ayya. Also all pathis has a Flag mast and a number of vahanas which are used to carry Ayya as processions during the festivals. And at present Swamithoppe and Ambalappathi has temple cars.\n\nThe Palliyarai designing in Pathis were different from that of Nizhal Thangals. No chairs or any other wooden structure are used but instead strictly raised pedestals in which a saffron cloth is wrapped. Above it there will be an armour-shaped brass structure which is called as \"Nama Vel\" is erected and a saffron or silk cloth wrapped around it forming the shape of an asana in which it is believed that, \"\"The invisible God is seated\"\". In all other Pathis except Ambalappathi, saffron cloth is used. The Sivaye Medai in Pathis are similar to that of Nizhal Thangals. \n\nAll Pathis has an inner corridor around the Palliyarai and outer corridor surrounding the whole Pathi. The outer corridor is called a \"Santhana Veethi\".\n\nSince Ayyavazhi is not an organised religion the Swamithope pathi though considered as religious headquarters, it officially does not control the rest of the religious centers. And hence all the Pathis are independently managed by different formed committies or by organisations. Some Pathis are maintained by the native Ayyavazhi followers of that particular area after the period of Vaikundar.\n\nIn all the Pathis three-time worship is conducted as per the Ayyavazhi scriptures. Ukappadippu in the Morning and Evening and the Ucchippadippu conducted for seven times at noon. \"Vhanam Eduppu\" is conducted twice a day in Swamithope pathi, once in a week in Ambalappathi on Tuesdays and at least once in a month in other pathis. \n\nThe main form of ritual \"Nithya pal\" (Pal vaippu) is conducted and consecrated to Ayya every day on every pathis. Thiru-Eadu Vasippu is also conducted frequently in all Pathis.\n\nThe important festivals in Pathis are Kodiyettru Thirunal for eleven days, the Thiru Eadu Vasippu for seventeen days and the \"Vaikunda Avathara Dinam\", the celebration for a couple of days during Ayya Vaikunda Avataram. The first two festivals are conducted in Pathis at different times once in a year while the Vaikunda Avatharam is celebrated simultaneously at all Pathis during Ayya Vaikunda Avataram. \n\nBut only in Swamithoppe the Kodiyetru Thirunal is conducted thrice in a year during the Tamil months of \"Avani\" (August/September), \"Thai\" (January/February) and \"Vaikasi\" (May/June) and each last for eleven days. Also, during every Sundays special prayers are conducted in all Pathis. The first Sundays of every Tamil month are considered sacred and special prayers are conducted in Swamithope Pathi. \n\nDuring the Ayya Vaikunda Avataram people use to go on pilgrimage to all holy places of Ayyavazhi, mainly the Panchappathis. Different processions are conducted from different places to the pathis, especially to Swamithoppe and Ambalappathi. In this the procession from Tiruchendur and Thiruvananthapuram to Swamithoppe is associated with the scriptures.\n\nFor a long period of time this term \"pathi\" has been discussed. Generally, the Pathi status is given for a site based on the scriptures and seeking, how much the site is important in the incarnation of Vaikundar. Another way of understanding this pathis is also prevalent, by seeking direct reference for a site as pathi in Akilam or Arul Nool. Anyway, commonly, a site which is not directly associated historically with any of the religious activities of Vaikundar is not accepted as a Pathi. \n\nAvatharappathi, the place at which Vaikundar incarnated from the sea is considered as a Pathi by Akilam. Akilam call this \"Chenthur Pathi\". But as some of the followers believe that the place at which the present temple is located is not the exact place where Ayya Vaikundar incarnated from the sea, they disagree with the rest of the devotees. The list of Pathis announced by the headquarters of Ayyavazhi does not include Avatharappathi. Also Vakaippathi is considered as a Pathi by the scripture in a sense that it was the northern entrance of 'Dwaraga Pathi' which is believed to be inside the sea. This site have another yet importance. It was here, the historical Thuvayal Thavasu conducted following the instructions of Vaikundar. \n\nAnother common listing is prevalent in which the Swamithope is replaced by Vakaippathi in Panchappathis and considering Swamithoppe as the head of these Panchappathis. Regarding Marunthuvazh Malai, an attempt is made there to kill Vaikundar by adding poison to milk. More over, he is said to be penanced here. So the Vaikunda Pathi is also considered as a Pathi. These three sites are not included in the list of Pathis released by the religious headquarters, Swamithoppe too. Except these, all other Pathis are accepted as so by the followers unanimously.\n\n\n\nThere is also the OscarPathi in France. It is brown and white and worshipped by exiles. It is located in Paris and is distinguished by the letters PPP in front of the temple. The high priest is a deep spiritual man who never talks and suffers from strabism.\n\nBurmese Muslims are also called Pathi in Burma. The Chinese pathis worship the PrincePathi. See Islam in Burma.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2026258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026258", "title": "Serjeant-at-law", "text": "Serjeant-at-law\n\nA Serjeant-at-Law (SL), commonly known simply as a Serjeant, was a member of an order of barristers at the English and Irish bar. The position of Serjeant-at-Law (\"servientes ad legem\"), or Sergeant-Counter, was centuries old; there are writs dating to 1300 which identify them as descended from figures in France before the Norman Conquest. The Serjeants were the oldest formally created order in England, having been brought into existence as a body by Henry II. The order rose during the 16th century as a small, elite group of lawyers who took much of the work in the central common law courts. With the creation of Queen's Counsel (or \"Queen's Counsel Extraordinary\") during the reign of Elizabeth I, the order gradually began to decline, with each monarch opting to create more King's or Queen's Counsel. The Serjeants' exclusive jurisdictions were ended during the 19th century and, with the Judicature Act 1873 coming into force in 1875, it was felt that there was no need to have such figures, and no more were created. The last appointed was Nathaniel Lindley, later a Law Lord, who retired in 1905 and died in 1921. The number of Irish Serjeants-at-law was limited to three (originally one, later two). The last appointment was A. M. Sullivan in 1912; after his 1921 relocation to the English bar he remained \"Serjeant Sullivan\" as a courtesy title.\n\nThe Serjeants had for many centuries exclusive jurisdiction over the Court of Common Pleas, being the only lawyers allowed to argue a case there. At the same time they had rights of audience in the other central common law courts (the Court of King's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas) and precedence over all other lawyers. Only Serjeants-at-Law could become judges of these courts right up into the 19th century, and socially the Serjeants ranked above Knights Bachelor and Companions of the Bath. Within the Serjeants-at-Law were more distinct orders; the King's Serjeants, particularly favoured Serjeants-at-Law, and within that the King's Premier Serjeant, the Monarch's most favoured Serjeant, and the King's Ancient Serjeant, the oldest. Serjeants (except King's Serjeants) were created by Writ of Summons under the Great Seal of the Realm and wore a special and distinctive dress, the chief feature of which was the coif, a white lawn or silk skullcap, afterwards represented by a round piece of white lace at the top of the wig.\n\nThe history of Serjeants-at-Law goes back to within a century of the Norman Conquest; Alexander Pulling argues that Serjeants-at-Law existed \"before any large portion of our law was formed\", and Edward Warren agrees, supporting him with a Norman writ from approximately 1300 which identifies Serjeants-at-Law as directly descending from Norman \"conteurs\"; indeed, they were sometimes known as Serjeant-Conteurs. The members of the Order initially used St Paul's Cathedral as their meeting place, standing near the \"parvis\" where they would give counsel to those who sought advice. Geoffrey Chaucer makes reference to the Serjeants in the \"Canterbury Tales\", General Prologue, writing:\nA serjeant of the law, ware and wise,<br>\nThat often hadde ben at the parvis,<br>\nTher was also, full rich of excellence.<br>\nDiscreet he was and of great reverence,<br>\nHe sened swiche; his wordes were so wise,<br>\nJustice he was ful often in assise,<br>\nBy patent, and by pleine commissiun;<br>\nFor his science, and for his high renoun,<br>\nOf fees and robes had he many on.\n\nThe Order certainly existed during the reign of Henry II from 1154–1189, who created a dozen Serjeants and thus moved the order's existence \"out of the realm of conjecture\" and into recorded fact. As such it is the oldest royally created order; the next is the Order of the Garter, created in 1330. Serjeants at Law existed in Ireland from at least 1302, and were appointed by letters patent in a similar way to English Serjeants. Henry de Bracton claimed that, for the trial of Hubert de Burgh in 1239 the king was assisted by \"all the serjeants of the bench\", although it is not known who they were. By the 1270s there were approximately 20 recorded Serjeants; by 1290, 36. This period also saw the first regulation of Serjeants, with a statutory power from 1275 to suspend from practise any Serjeant who misbehaved (enacted as chapter 29 of the Statute of Westminster 1275). The exclusive jurisdiction Serjeants-at-Law held over the Court of Common Pleas slowly came about during the 1320s, squeezing the size of the bar until only a consistent group reappeared. From this period, Serjeants also began to be called in regular groups, rather than individually on whatever date was felt appropriate.\n\nDuring the 16th century the Serjeants-at-Law were a small, though highly respected and powerful, elite. There were never more than ten alive, and on several occasions the number dwindled to one; William Blendlowes bragged that he had been \"the only Serjeant-at-Law in England\" in 1559. Over these 100 years, only 89 Serjeants were created. At the time they were the only clearly distinguishable branch of the legal profession, and it is thought that their work may have actually created barristers as a separate group; although Serjeants were the only lawyers who normally argued in court, they occasionally allowed other lawyers to help them in special cases. These lawyers became known as outer or \"utter\" barristers (because they were confined to the outer bar of the court); if they were allowed to act they had \"passed the bar\" towards becoming a Serjeant-at-Law.\n\nDespite holding a monopoly on cases in the Court of Common Pleas, Serjeants also took most of the business in the Court of King's Bench. Although required to make the Common Pleas their principal place of work, there is evidence of Serjeants who did not; one, Robert Mennell, worked entirely in the North of England after his creation in 1547 and was not known in Westminster, where the Common Pleas was located. This was also a time of great judicial success for the Serjeants; since only Serjeants could be appointed to the common law courts, many also sat in the Exchequer of Pleas, a court of equity. This period was not a time of success for the profession overall, however, despite the brisk business being done. The rise of central courts other than the Common Pleas allowed other lawyers to gain advocacy experience and work, drawing it away from the Serjeants, and at the same time the few Serjeants could not handle all the business in the Common Pleas, allowing the rise of barristers as dedicated advocates.\n\nThe decline of the Serjeants-at-Law started in 1596, when Francis Bacon persuaded Elizabeth I to appoint him \"Queen's Counsel Extraordinary\" (QC), a new creation which gave him precedence over the Serjeants. This was not a formal creation, in that he was not granted a patent of appointment, but in 1604 James I saw fit to finally award this. The creation of Queen's (or King's) Counsel was initially small; James I created at least one other, and Charles I four. Following the English Restoration this increased, with a few appointed each year. The largest change came about with William IV, who appointed an average of nine a year, and following him approximately 12 were created a year, with an average of 245 at any one time.\n\nEvery new Queen's Counsel created reduced the Serjeants in importance, since even the most junior QC took precedence over the most senior Serjeant. Although appointments were still made to the Serjeants-at-Law, the King's Serjeant and the King's Ancient Serjeant, and several Serjeants were granted patents of precedence which gave them superiority over QCs, the Victorian era saw a decline in appointments. The rule that all common law judges must be Serjeants was circumvented: anyone chosen to be a judge would be appointed a Serjeant, and immediately thereafter a judge. In 1834 Lord Brougham issued a mandate which opened up pleading in the Court of Common Pleas to every barrister, Serjeant or not, and this was followed for six years until the Serjeants successfully petitioned the Queen to overturn it as invalid.\n\nThe Serjeants only enjoyed their returned status for another six years, however, before Parliament intervened. The Practitioners in Common Pleas Act 1846, from 18 August 1846, allowed all barristers to practice in the Court of Common Pleas. The next and final blow was the Judicature Act 1873, which came into force on 1 November 1875. Section 8 provided that common law judges need no longer be appointed from the Serjeants-at-Law, removing the need to appoint judicial Serjeants. With this Act and the rise of the Queen's Counsel, there was no longer any need to appoint Serjeants, and the practice ended.\n\nThe equivalent Irish rank of Serjeant-at-law survived until 1919. Alexander Sullivan, the last Irish serjeant, spent the second half of his career at the English Bar, and as a matter of courtesy was always addressed as Serjeant.\n\nSerjeant's Inn was an Inn of Court restricted to Serjeants-at-Law. It operated from three locations, one in Holborn, known as Scroope's Inn, which was abandoned by 1498 for the one in Fleet Street, which was pulled down during the 18th century, and one on Chancery Lane, pulled down in 1877. The Inn was a voluntary association, and although most Serjeants joined upon being appointed they were not required to. There were rarely more than 40 Serjeants, even including members of the judiciary, and the Inns were noticeably smaller than the Inns of Court. Unlike the Inns of Court, Serjeant's Inn was a private establishment similar to a gentlemen's club.\n\nThe Inn on Fleet Street existed from at least 1443, when it was rented from the Dean of York. By the 16th century it had become the main Inn, before being burnt down during the Great Fire of London. It was rebuilt by 1670, but the end finally came in 1733. The Fleet Street Inn had fallen into a \"ruinous state\", and the Serjeants had been unable to obtain a renewal of their lease. They abandoned the property, and it returned to the Dean.\n\nThe property on Chancery Lane consisted of a Hall, dining room, a library, kitchens and offices for the Serjeants-at-Law. This Inn was originally known as \"Skarle's Inn\" from about 1390, named after John Scarle, who became Master of the Rolls in 1394. By 1404 it was known as \"Farringdon's Inn\", but although the Serjeants were in full possession by 1416 it was not until 1484 that the property became known as Serjeant's Inn. Newly promoted Serjeants had to pay £350 in the 19th century, while those promoted solely to take up judicial office had to pay £500. The Hall was a large room hung with portraits of various famous judges and Serjeants-at-Law, with three windows on one side each containing the coat of arms of a distinguished judge. Around the room were the coats of arms of various Serjeants, which were given to their descendants when the Inn was finally sold. When the Fleet Street Inn was abandoned, this location became the sole residence of the Serjeants. With the demise of the order after the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, there was no way to support the Inn, and it was sold in 1877 for £57,100. The remaining Serjeants were accepted into their former Inns of Court, where judicial Serjeants were made Benchers and normal Serjeants barristers.\n\nThe process of being called to the order of Serjeants-at-Law stayed fairly constant. The traditional method was that the Serjeants would discuss among themselves prospective candidates, and then make recommendations to the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. He would pass these names on to the Lord Chancellor, who would appoint the new Serjeants. This was intended to provide a way to select possible judges in a period where political favouritism was rampant – since only Serjeants could become judges, making sure that Serjeants were not political appointees was seen to provide for a neutral judiciary. Serjeants were traditionally appointed by a writ directly from the King. The writ was issued under the Great Seal of the Realm and required \"the elected and qualified apprentices of the law to take the state and degree of a Serjeant-at-Law\". The newly created Serjeants would then assemble in one of the Inns of Court, where they would hear a speech from the Lord Chancellor or Lord Chief Justice and be given a purse of gold. The Coif was then placed on the Serjeant's head. The Serjeants were required to swear an oath, which was that they would:\nserve the King's people as one of the Serjeants-at-law, and you shall truly counsel them that you be retained with after your cunning; and you shall not defer or delay their causes willingly, for covetness of money, or other thing that may turn you to profit; and you shall give due attendance accordingly. So help you God.\n\nThe new Serjeants would give a feast to celebrate, and gave out rings to their close friends and family to mark the occasion. The King, the Lord Chancellor and other figures also received rings. The major courts would be suspended for the day, and the other Serjeants, judges, leaders of the Inns of Court and occasionally the King would attend. Serjeant's Inn and the Inns of Court were not big enough for such an occasion, and Ely Place or Lambeth Palace would instead be used. The feasts gradually declined in importance, and by the 17th century they were small enough to be held in the Inns. The last recorded feast was in 1736 in Middle Temple, when fourteen new Serjeants were raised to the Coif.\n\nThe traditional clothing of a Serjeant-at-Law consisted of a coif, a robe and a furred cloak. The robe and cloak were later adapted into the robe worn by judges. The cut and colour of this robe varied – records from the King's Privy Wardrobe show judges being instructed to wear robes of scarlet, green, purple and miniver, and Serjeants being ordered to wear the same. In 1555 new Serjeants were required to have robes of scarlet, brown, blue, mustard and murrey. By the time the order came to an end the formal robes were red, but Mr. Serjeant Robinson recalled that, towards the end days of the order, black silk gowns were the everyday court garb and the red gown was worn only on certain formal occasions. The cape was originally a cloak worn separately from the robe, but gradually made its way into the uniform as a whole. John Fortescue described the cape as the \"main ornament of the order\", distinguished only from the cape worn by judges because it was furred with lambskin rather than miniver. The capes were not worn into court by the advocates, only by the serjeants.\n\nThe coif was the main symbol of the Order of Serjeants-at-Law, and is where their most recognisable name (the Order of the Coif) comes from. The coif was white and made of either silk or lawn. A Serjeant was never obliged to take off or cover his coif, not even in the presence of the King, except as a judge when passing a death sentence. In that situation he would wear a black cap intended to cover the Coif, although it is often confused with the coif itself. When wigs were first introduced for barristers and judges it caused some difficulty for Serjeants, who were not allowed to cover the coif. Wigmakers got around this by adding a small white cloth to the top of the wig, representing the coif.\n\nA King's or Queen's Serjeant was a Serjeant-at-Law appointed to serve the Crown as a legal adviser to the monarch and their government in the same way as the Attorney-General for England and Wales. The King's Serjeant (who had the postnominal KS, or QS during the reign of a female monarch) would represent the Crown in court, acting as prosecutor in criminal cases and representative in civil ones, and would have higher powers and ranking in the lower courts than the Attorney- or Solicitor General. King's Serjeants also worked as legal advisers in the House of Lords, and were not allowed to act in cases against the Crown or do anything that would harm it; in 1540 Serjeant Browne was heavily punished for creating a tax avoidance scheme. The King's Serjeants would wear a black Coif with a narrow strip of white, unlike the all-white Coif of a normal Serjeant. The King's Serjeants were required to swear a second oath to serve \"The King and his people\", rather than \"The King's people\" as a Serjeant-at-Law would swear. The King's favoured Serjeant would become the King's Premier Serjeant, while the oldest one was known as the King's Ancient Serjeant.\n\nFor almost all of their history, Serjeants at Law and King's Serjeants were the only advocates given rights of audience in the Court of Common Pleas. Until the 17th century they were also first in the order of precedence in the Court of King's Bench and Court of Chancery, which gave them priority in motions before the court. Serjeants also had the privilege of being immune from most normal forms of lawsuit – they could only be sued by a writ from the Court of Chancery. It was held as an extension of this that servants of Serjeants could only be sued in the Common Pleas. As part of the Court of Common Pleas the Serjeants also performed some judicial duties, such as levying fines. In exchange for these privileges, Serjeants were expected to fulfil certain duties; firstly, that they represent anybody who asked regardless of their ability to pay, and secondly that, due to the small number of judges, they serve as deputy judges to hear cases when there was no judge available.\n\nOnly Serjeants-at-Law could become judges of the common law courts; this rule came into being in the 14th century for the Courts of Common Pleas and King's Bench, and was extended to the Exchequer of Pleas in the 16th century; it did not apply to the Court of Chancery, a court of equity, or the Ecclesiastical Courts. The Serjeants-at-Law also had social privileges; they ranked above Knights Bachelor and Companions of the Bath, and their wives had the right to be addressed as \"Lady —\", in the same way as the wives of knights or baronets. A Serjeant made a King's Counsel or judge would still retain these social privileges. As the cream of the legal profession, Serjeants earned higher fees than normal barristers.\n\nIn the order of precedence King's Serjeants came before all other barristers, even the Attorney-General, until the introduction of King's Counsel. This state of affairs came to an end as a result of two changes – firstly, during the reign of James I, when a royal patent gave the Attorney General precedence over all King's Serjeants \"except the two ancientiest\", and secondly in 1814 when the Attorney General of the time was a barrister and the Solicitor General (politically junior to the Attorney General) a King's Serjeant. To reflect the political reality, the Attorney General was made superior to any King's Serjeant, and this remained until the order of Serjeants-at-Law finally died out.\n\nThe main character in C.J. Sansom's 'Shardlake' novels, hunchback lawyer Matthew Shardlake, is a Serjeant-at-Law during the reign of King Henry VIII of England.\n\n"}
{"id": "2026263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026263", "title": "Jeffrey Foskett", "text": "Jeffrey Foskett\n\nJeffrey Foskett is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer best known as a touring and studio musician for Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys since the 1980s. Foskett was described as the Beach Boys' \"vice principal\" by its touring members. In 1996, he debuted as a solo artist with the album \"Thru My Window\".\n\nBorn and raised in San Jose, California, Foskett began his first band in the 1970s known as Cherry, after the Willow Glen area street on which he lived. Foskett played mostly surf music covers in the same market as Papa Doo Run Run, with whom Foskett would join forces later. In the late 1970s, Foskett formed two renowned bands: The Reverie Rhythm Rockers (aka Reverie) and The Pranks while attending UCSB in Santa Barbara, California, gigging throughout the area with fellow area bands like D. B. Cooper. The band held a house residency at The Troubadore Nightclub in Hollywood Mondays performing with The Mentors, The Cretones, The Police and 20/20.\n\nFoskett became a fan of the Beach Boys after he heard \"I Get Around\" and became determined to meet Brian Wilson. In 1976, Foskett tracked down Wilson's house in Bel Air, which had a stained-glass window resembling the artwork of the 1967 album \"Wild Honey\". After knocking on Wilson's door, he was greeted by a friendly Wilson and quickly invited into his house as a guest. The two then kept in contact over the years.\n\nIn late 1979, Wilson's cousin Mike Love stopped by the famous Santa Barbara restaurant \"1129\" where Reverie was the house band. Love listened to Foskett and hired Reverie as the original incarnation of The Endless Summer Beach Band. The band toured with Love through 1981 when Foskett replaced Wilson's brother Carl Wilson who briefly left the Beach Boys to pursue a solo career. When Carl rejoined the Beach Boys in May 1982, Foskett was asked to stay to perform Wilson's falsetto parts, which he did on and off until he was fired by Wilson after a performance on July 4th, 1990.\n\nFoskett was a reliable member of the Beach Boys until the early 1990s in which Carl noticed that he had gained a large amount of weight and it may have been taking a toll on his live performance standard. After a show on July 4th, 1990, Carl pulled Foskett aside and broke the news to him that he would not be performing with the band until he got his health back on track. Wilson said to Fosket that \"there are six strings on a guitar and I suggest you use all of them.\" Foskett later said that this was a blessing and being fired from the Beach Boys really opened his eyes and inspired him to become healthy again.\n\nWhen Brian Wilson returned to touring in the late 1990s, he asked Foskett to help him assemble his touring band. Foskett was the musical director, appearing at every solo show Wilson had performed, up until his departure from Wilson's band. In concerts, Foskett provided lead vocals on several of Wilson's songs, including \"Don't Worry Baby\", \"The Warmth Of The Sun\" and \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" as well as others. Foskett has appeared as guitarist/vocalist/arranger on a majority of Wilson solo material, including the 2004 version of \"SMiLE\".\n\nIn 2012, Foskett joined the Beach Boys' live band on their 50th Anniversary Reunion Tour, and subsequently recorded the studio album \"That's Why God Made the Radio\" alongside the band, performing all of the falsetto vocal parts as well as other vocals on the record. Regarding his role in the reunion, Al Jardine stated, \"Jeffrey is invaluable to keeping the continuity between the various component parts. He supports Brian in every possible way. He has Brian's confidence, and basically kind of makes it possible to have Brian Wilson on the road with us. [Without] that shoulder to lean on, I think it would be very difficult for Brian to tour. And I'm very grateful for that.\" On the tour he provided lead vocals on \"Don't Worry Baby\", \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" (Alongside Jardine) and \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love\" as well as singing all of the falsetto vocals.\n\nFollowing the reunion tour, Foskett resumed touring with Wilson in 2013. Wilson enlisted guitarist Jeff Beck to accompany him and Foskett on his tour and collaborate with him on his next album. Foskett left the touring band in late 2013, citing sudden heavy workload on touring and recording the album. Foskett said “After the Jeff Beck tour, I was completely stressed and burned out. That whole year, recording that album and that tour — because I knew Jeff so well — a lot of things fell on me to get done that normally would have been other people’s responsibilities. So, at the end of that tour, I kind of snapped — literally — and just said, ‘I can’t do this anymore'.

It originally aired on December 15, 1961. It features early film star Buster Keaton in one of his later roles, as an unlikely time traveler, and the opening and closing scenes pay homage to the silent films for which he was famous.\n\nWoodrow Mulligan is a grumpy man in 1890, dissatisfied with what his world has come to: the nation's budget surplus is only 85 million dollars, prices are shockingly high to him, and his once-quiet town of Harmony, New York is bustling with livestock roaming the streets, which are full of traffic such as horse-drawn carriages, and penny-farthing bicycles zipping along at the speed limit of 8 mph. A collision with a bicyclist dumps him in a water trough, forcing him to take off his pants to dry them when he gets to his place of work.\n\nHe works as janitor for Professor Gilbert, who has just invented a \"time helmet\", which can transport the wearer to another decade for 30 minutes. Mulligan tries it on and it sends him to 1962; Harmony is now a busy city with streets full of cars, all sorts of urban noise, and astonishingly high prices. In the chaos he loses the helmet, which is picked up by a boy on roller skates, requiring Mulligan to give chase on a contemporary bicycle. He recovers the damaged helmet as he runs into Rollo, a scientist. They take the helmet to a \"fix it\" shop, where Rollo and the proprietor argue over repairs, while Mulligan wanders off and acquires a pair of pants by slapstick means.\n\nRollo regards the 1890s as an idyllic period, and wants to go back there in Mulligan's place. He runs off with the helmet, but Mulligan catches him at the last instant and they both go back. Mulligan is relieved to be home, and Rollo finds it charming. A week later, Mulligan has found a new appreciation for life in 1890, but Rollo is dismayed at the lack of technology and modern comforts. Annoyed by Rollo's griping, Mulligan sets the helmet for 1962, puts it on Rollo's head, and sends him back to his own time.\n\n\nBuster Keaton was one of the biggest stars of the silent era, and this episode featuring him was intended as an homage to that work. One sequence, occurring almost immediately after traveling to the episode's present day, is a near exact replication of a gag Keaton introduced some forty-one years earlier in a Fatty Arbuckle film titled \"The Garage\".\n\nThe parts set in the 1890s are done in the style of a silent film with intertitles and feature only a soundtrack of a saloon piano (and Rod Serling's customary opening and closing narration). Much is made of the fact that Mulligan shows up in 1962 with no pants due to his getting run over by a \"high speed\" bicycle and falling into a water trough, forcing him to remove the pants while they dry. A running gag has a pants-less Mulligan being chased by a policeman in both the past and the present.\n\n\n"}

The group was managed by Yamaguchi-San when they were in the WWF.\n\nThe group debuted in Japan's Michinoku Pro wrestling promotion in late 1994 when SATO, Terry Boy and Shiryu introduced themselves as Kai En Tai. The name \"Kai En Tai\" was based on Japan's first modern corporation, Kaientai (\"Naval Auxiliary Force\"), a naval institution and paramilitary organization dedicated to freeing Japan from feudal rule and protecting the country's national sovereignty that was a major player in the introduction of the Meiji Restoration.\n\nKai En Tai had many high profile tag team matches before two of them changed their names; SATO became Dick Togo, Terry Boy became Men's Teioh while Shiryu's name remained unchanged. The stable's name was also changed to \"Kaientai Deluxe\", or Kaientai DX for short. They would later be joined by The Dream Chasers (Taka Michinoku and Shoichi Funaki) as new members. Other members included Hanzo Nakajima, Yoshihiro Tajiri, Gran Hamada and Super Boy.\n\nIn early 1997, Taka Michinoku, Dick Togo and Terry Boy had a short stint in Extreme Championship Wrestling as BWO Japan (also known as \"BWO International\") and feuded with the fellow Japanese team of The Great Sasuke, Gran Hamada and Gran Naniwa. The rivalry culminated at ECW's first ever Pay-Per-View event Barely Legal 1997 where the team of Sasuke, Hamada and Masato Yakushiji (filling in for an injured Gran Naniwa) came out victorious. Since then, Kai En Tai would permanently adopt the bWo colors of blue and white as their own.\n\nKai En Tai (with the exception of Shiryu, who was in WCW under his real name, Kaz Hayashi) made their first appearance in the WWF the night after WrestleMania XIV on the March 30, 1998 episode of \"Raw is War\". The team dropped the 'DX' from their full title due to the existence of D-Generation X in the WWF. They attacked Taka Michinoku — who signed with the WWF much earlier — because they felt he had become Americanized since joining the WWE until he later rejoined them. Kaientai was originally referred to by the announcers as Club Kamikaze, but their new manager Yamaguchi-San announced their actual name upon his arrival shortly afterwards.\n\nTheir most infamous WWF feud was with Val Venis, who had a porn star gimmick at the time. Yamaguchi was enraged when he was shown a pornographic video of his (onscreen) wife, sleeping with Venis, and threatened to punish both of them. Mrs. Yamaguchi-San was brought to the ring for what was going to be a spanking by Yamaguchi-san using a wooden paddle, but she was rescued by Venis. A week later, just as Venis had finished a match, Yamaguchi and Kaientai showed up with a salami on a table. Yamaguchi proceeded to chop the salami while shouting at Venis, \"I choppy choppy your pee pee!\"\n\nThe following week, Venis teamed up with Taka Michinoku to take on Togo and Funaki in a tag team match. Taka made a swerve, however, by turning against Venis, proclaiming that Mrs. Yamaguchi-San was his sister. Venis was dragged backstage by Kaientai to have his member amputated, though the audience did not see what happened next. Venis returned after a week, explained that Yamaguchi's sword narrowly missed his genitalia, due to the lights being turned off by John Wayne Bobbitt, broke off his relationship with Mrs. Yamaguchi-San and thus ended the feud.\n\nAfter Togo, Teioh and both Yamaguchis left the WWF, Michinoku and Funaki began wrestling as a tag team using the name Kaientai. They were primarily jobbers, best known for their \"Evil! Indeed!\" skits in which Bruce Prichard dubbed English voices into their promos while they badly lip-synced, with Taka ending his \"comments\" with \"Evil!\" and Funaki \"saying\" only \"Indeed!\" Funaki and Taka's last ever tag team partnership as Kaientai in the WWF was a win over Raven and Justin Credible on the October 20, 2001 edition of \"WWF Jakked\".\n\nMichinoku eventually left the WWF. He ran a promotion called Kaientai Dojo (or K-DOJO) until 2019. Funaki remained in the WWF, finding a niche as part of the \"SmackDown\" cruiserweight division and as a backstage interviewer before being released from his contract in 2010 after 12 years with the company. However, he has since been re-hired and currently serves as a member of the Japanese commentary team.\n\nWith the occasion of Michinoku Pro's 10th Anniversary on November 2, 2003, Kaientai DX reformed, as Dick Togo, Men's Teioh, Taka Michinoku, Shiryu and Hanzo Nakajima took down Jinsei Shinzaki, Hayate, Kesen Numa-jiro, Kazuya Yuasa and Chi-Nen Hokkai.\n\nOn July 15, 2005, another Kaientai reunion took place at Kaientai Dojo, when Taka Michinoku teamed up with Sho Funaki, Dick Togo and Men's Teioh to do battle with Kengo Mashimo, Kazma, Ryota Chikuzen and Kunio Toshima. Although Kaientai came up short of defeating the opposing team, it was a very emotional moment and the crowd showed their support after the match.\n\nKaientai reunited once again on the 2006 New Year's Eve Indie Summit show where Taka Michinoku, Sho Funaki, Kaz Hayashi, Dick Togo and Men's Teioh defeated Makoto Oishi, Kudo, Katsuya Kishi, Shinjitsu Nohashi and Milanito Collection a.t. The Kaientai team claimed victory after Togo hit Oishi with a diving senton. On January 25, 2007, Taka Michinoku, Men's Teioh and Dick Togo appeared in Dragon Gate to take on the team of Cima, BxB Hulk and Matt Sydal.\n\n\n"}

Editor Ruth Reichl, in the middle of a tour promoting the \"Gourmet Today\" cookbook, confirmed that the magazine's November 2009 issue, distributed in mid-October, was the magazine's last.\n\nThe \"Gourmet\" brand continues to be used by Condé Nast for book and television programming and recipes appearing on Epicurious.com. Since the end of its regular run, Condé Nast has also used the \"Gourmet\" brand in a series of special edition magazines, covering niches ranging from grilling and Italian food, to quick recipes, holiday foods, and comfort foods.\n\n\"Gourmet\" was founded by Earle MacAusland who went on to serve as publisher and editor in chief for nearly forty years. Its first issue was dated January 1941, and its main competitor at the time was \"American Cookery\", formerly the Boston Cooking School Magazine, also known as the “Boston Cooking-school Magazine Of Culinary Science And Domestic Economics”, which had been published since 1896. The Boston Cooking Magazine was founded by S.S. Pierce, a man who MacAusland took a lot of inspiration and lessons from to found his own magazine. Much of the content was similar – articles on food, recipes by the magazine, recipes submitted by readers, recipes requested by readers and advice sought by readers. But \"American Cookery\" was illustrated in black-and-white, printed on newsprint, with smaller pages and content focused on America. \"Gourmet\" was upscale, slick, in color, with a focus on Europe and New York City, and most of its recipes carrying French names.\n\nCondé Nast bought the magazine in 1983.\n\nOn October 5, 2009 Condé Nast Publications CEO Chuck Townsend announced that the magazine would cease monthly publication; the company \"will remain committed to the brand, retaining \"Gourmet\"’s book publishing and television programming, and \"Gourmet\" recipes on Epicurious.

The rank is usually above assistant superintendent and below superintendent.\n\nThe rank of deputy superintendent of police or assistant commissioner of police (ACP) in the commissionerate system was created in 1876 as the policy of Indianisation was introduced. It was originally a rank only held by Indians and was equivalent to assistant superintendent (a rank then only held by Europeans). Deputy superintendents are now state police officers who belong to the provincial police forces, either direct entrants at that rank or promoted from inspector. Assistant commissioners of police, who are members of the provincial forces, can be promoted to the Indian Police Service after limited years of service which varies from 8 to 15 years depending on the state. Deputy superintendents are generally posted as circle officers in a district. In the states of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, the rank is commonly known as circle officer (CO), although this is not technically correct as CO is a post, not a rank. In the state of West Bengal, a DSP is in charge of a sub-division and is most commonly known as a sub divisional police officer (SDPO).\n\nCandidates must be Indian citizens with any degree and between the ages of 21 to 38 years. There is a minimum physical requirement of height for men and for women, chest requirement of and chest expansion of . In Tamil Nadu, is the minimum height required.

He was originally drafted 176th overall by the Colorado Avalanche at the 1996 NHL Entry Draft, though he never played for the team.\n\nPåhlsson won an Olympic gold medal with Sweden at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, as well as a Stanley Cup the following season with Anaheim in 2007.\n\nAfter a stint with a fourth-tier men's league based out of his hometown Ånge, Sweden, Påhlsson joined the Modo Hockey organization in 1994–95, debuting in one Elitserien game. The following season, he split his time between Modo's Elitserien and junior teams. After recording 21 points over 30 junior games and 4 points over 36 Elitserien contests, Påhlsson was selected by the Colorado Avalanche, 176th overall, in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft.

He was sent to Boston, along with Brian Rolston, Martin Grenier and a first-round pick in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft, in exchange for Dave Andreychuk and Ray Bourque. Påhlsson joined the Bruins for the 2000–01 season and played 17 games with the team before being traded once again on November 18, 2000, to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in exchange for Andrei Nazarov and Patrick Traverse. Påhlsson completed his NHL rookie campaign with nine points over 76 games.\n\nThe 2002–03 season brought Påhlsson and the Mighty Ducks to the Stanley Cup Final, though they were defeated in seven games by the New Jersey Devils.\n\nDuring the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Påhlsson returned to Sweden to play for Frölunda HC, helping the team to an Elitserien championship.

Hearing this Vaikundar proceeded towards Ambalappathi.\n\nHe stayed at Pallam near Manakkudy for two years for completing the incarnational activities. This place is called as Ambalappathi. Ayya Vaikundar was a \"Shiva-sorub\" (taking the form of Siva) at this place. As a Shiva-sorubi, Ayya assumed the powers of Parvathi and Bhagavathi. As Muruga, he assumed the powers of Valli and Dheivanai. As Brahma, he also assumed the powers of Madaikattal. It was from this place that the devotees took Ayya on horseback to such villages as Kadambankulam and Pambankulam. Ayya established Nizhal Thangals in these villages. Later, at the end of the second year, Ayya Vaikundar returned to Swamithoppe.\n\nThe former name of Ambalappathi was \"Kurali Vadalivilai\", and the land is owned by Latchumanan Potthi. Once there was Siva and Kali temple where the Ambalappathi is located now. To conduct pooja in ths temple this, Letchumanan Potthi use to come daily to this temple. At that time Ayya in the form of a mendicant, sit beneath a Pipal tree, pretend to be a newcomer and use to collect information about this temple with Latchumanan Potthi. Then he asked Latchumanan Potthi to open the temple. Hearing this Latchumanan Potthi asked five panam (a then currency) to open, and five \"Panam\" to close; so totally ten panam to show the deity. Ayya replied, \"\"If the one who present inside is my sister, then the door will open itself.\"\" The door opened immediately, and Ayya went inside.\n\nThen after when Ayya asked Latchumanan Potthi for some water to drink. Potthi answered that it was hard to fetch water in that jungle. Hearing this Ayya pointed the \"Perambu\" (cane) to a spot there and asked Potthi to dig. When he did so water squeezed from the earth. It was this the present Muthirikkinaru of Ambalappathi.\n\nThen for some days Ayya stayed there and performed several miracles beneath a Pipal tree there. After, Latchumanan Potthi donated that land to Ayya.\n\nLater, on this very spot the followers of Ayya constructed a Pathi and conducted daily Panividai. Now, this Pathi is managed by the descendants of the people who constructed the Pathi. Every year Kodiyettru Thirunal including Car festivals are conducted in this Pathi. There are many \"Vahanas\" to carry Ayya Vaikundar around the Pathi. It lies 8 kilometers south-east to Nagercoil, the capital of Kanyakumari district and 11 kilometers west to Kanyakumari, the southern tip of the Indian sub-continent. It also lies half a way between the towns of Rajakkamangalam and Kanyakumari on the Western Coastal Road. There is a direct bus service from Nagercoil to this Pathi. Ambala Pathi is located at \n\nSince Ayya Vaikundar unified all the different divine powers into himself and revealed his supremacy here in Ambala Pathi, this is one of the most important Pilgrim centers for Ayyavazhi people, next to Swamithoppe. Akilam the primary scripture of Ayyavazhi, gives though not a greater, but an equal status for Ambalappathi with Swamithope pathi. This Pathi is also called \"Pallathu pathi\" and \"Mulakunda pathi\".\n\nThe Palliyarai of Ambalappathi is said to be constructed during the period of Ayya. It was surrounded by the inner corridor. This inner corridor is called Tatuva Kottagai and it earn its name from its unique architecture planning. It was a tiled roof structure and is designed that 96 wooden beams starting from the end of the corridor and confluences into a single wooden pot mounted at the center of the roof, which symbolises the 96 Tatvas of the human body. There is no other external support for this roof other that the four walls of the corridor.\n\nIn front of this inner corridor, there is a hall in which the prayers are conducted. The \"Vahana purai\" is in the left and the \"Unpan purai\" is located right to the central hall. \"Vadakku vaasal\", the northern entrance is located on the right of the Palliyarai. And the Sivaye medai is located left to the central prayer hall. The Flag mast is placed in front of the prayer hall. The outer corridor is constructed enclosing all these. The \"Thear mandapam\", which houses the temple car is located 100 feet east to the prayer hall.\n\nThe Muthirikkinaru is located 50 meters north-eastern corrnor of the Pathi. Near this well there is a separate monument constructed similar to Hindu architecture near the pipal tree, which is believed to be the place where Ayya use to rest as per a legendary. But this structure doesn't include any images or idols of god-heads of Hinduism. But constitutes only the images of Ayyavazhi symbols. The Four-car street surrounds the whole of the Pathi, excluding Muthirikkinaru.\n\nThough the Panivdais are conducted thrice a day the special panividais are on every tues days. Every Tuesdays are considered as a festival day here in Ambalappathi. The Akilam is read during these festival days. At the end the Vahanam eduppu is conducted. And the festival closes with Anna Dharmams.\n\nThe Kodiyettru Thirunal in Ambalappathi is conducted during the Tamil month of Aippsi (October/November). Ayya Vaikunda Avataram is also celebrated in a grand scale in Ambalappathi. The Thiru Edu Vasippu, the festival during which Akilam is read melodiously, is also Conducted.\n\n\n"}

Taking his degree in 1863, he was called to the bar as a member of the Inner Temple in 1867. \n\nHe then entered upon a long career in South Africa. He was attorney-general of Griqualand West from 1873 until 1877, when he was made acting recorder of the High Court of Griqualand. The next year, after clashes with the new Governor Henry Bartle Frere and the Lieutenant Governor of Griqualand West Sir William Owen Lanyon, he retired from the position. \n\nFrom 1880 to 1885 he sat as a judge of the Supreme Court of Cape Colony; and he was British commissioner on the Anglo-German commission in 1884-1885 for settling the claims of British subjects at Lüderitz Bay (\"German: Lüderitzbucht\") and other parts of the south-west coast.\n\nShippard, while at Oxford in 1878, had discussed with Cecil Rhodes the plan of the projected British advance in south central Africa. He saw in the German annexation of Damaraland and Namaqualand the first step in a design to secure for Germany territory stretching from ocean to ocean—a design which if executed would have been fatal to the British position in South Africa. Consequently, when after the Warren expedition of 1885 he was chosen to organize the newly acquired British possessions in Bechuanaland he saw in his appointment an opportunity for forestalling the Germans, and also the Boer adventurers who likewise sought to be beforehand with Britain in the countries north of the Limpopo.\n\nFrom his first establishment in Bechuanaland he kept up a friendly correspondence with the Matabele king Lobengula with the object of attaching him to the British cause. At the end of 1887 he went to Graham's Town with the hope of inducing the high commissioner (Sir Hercules Robinson afterwards Lord Rosmead) to sanction the conclusion of a treaty with Lobengula binding that ruler not to cede any part of his territory to any other power than England. \"I used all my power of persuasion,\" Sir Sidney writes, \"but failed to induce Lord Rosmead either to act on his own responsibility in the matter or to approach Her Majesty's government on the subject. As a last resource I telegraphed to Mr Rhodes, who was then busily engaged at Kimberley, to come down at once to Graham's Town and try the effect of his eloquence. He came, and by taking upon himself all pecuniary responsibility succeeded in obtaining the requisite sanction\" (see article \"Bechuanaland,\" by Sir S Shippard, in \"British Africa\", London,1899). The treaty was signed and British interests secured.\n\nShippard was thenceforth freer to devote himself to the special interests of Bechuanaland, which he governed with conspicuous success. He held the chief official position there from 1885 to 1895, being administrator, chief magistrate and president of the Land Commission for British Bechuanaland, and resident-commissioner for the Bechuanaland Protectorate and the Kalahari. He was created Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1887. In 1896 he played an unofficial part in the negotiations between Sir Hercules Robinson and the Johannesburg reformers after the Jameson Raid. He then returned to England, where he died in London on the 29 March 1902.\n\nShippard was twice married. First, in 1864, Maria Stockenström, daughter of Sir Andries Stockenström. After her early death in 1870, he remarried Rosalind Ayshford Sanford, daughter of William Ayshford Sanford, of Nynehead Court, Somerset. Lady Shippard died in 1935.\n"}

The communist state was established during a successful counter-offensive of the Red Army in the summer of 1920 as part of the Polish-Soviet War and in the course of which the Polish-Ukrainian joint military force (Polish Ukrainian Front) was forced to retreat from its positions along the Dnieper that it secured earlier in 1920 all the way to the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains.\n\nThe republic became a buffer zone of the ongoing conflict within the area of the South-Western front of the Red Army. Due to the successful offensive in July 1920, the Soviet government also created the Polrevkom and had intentions of creating the Polish Socialist Soviet Republic. A similar, but less elaborate activity, of the communist Polrevkom, was related to the North-Western front of the Red Army (the \"government\" was seated in Białystok).\n\nThe Galician SSR was established on 15 July 1920 when the Galician Revolutionary Committee (Halrevkom), a provisional government headed by Volodymyr Zatonsky (Vladimir Zatonsky) and created on 8 July in Kiev under the auspices of the Communist Party of Bolsheviks of Ukraine (CP(b)U), issued its declaration.\n\nThe communist government moved to Tarnopol (today Ternopil) in East Galicia on 1 August 1920 upon occupation of the region by the Red Army. The same day the Halrevkom adopted a decree \"About establishing of Soviet power in Galicia\". The national languages (of equal status) were declared to be Polish, Ukrainian and Yiddish. With its decrees, the communist government abolished private ownership of the means of production, established an eight-hour workday, separated church from state and nationalised church estates, established a single labour school with seven-year education, and nationalised the land. By the end of August, the Halrevkom tried to conduct elections to establish a permanent Soviet government and convene the All-Galician congress of Soviets.\n\nWith the Polish offensive on 15 September, those plans failed and the Halrevkom withdrew from Tarnopol. On 21 September 1920, the republic was officially abolished and its revolutionary committee was transformed into the Galician Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine. With the signing of the Peace of Riga in March 1921, the bureau was liquidated.\n\nHalrevkom did not control the most important area of East Galicia: the Lviv area with its oilfields of Boryslav and Drohobych.\n\n\n\n"}

Although Bradbury contributed several scripts to \"The Twilight Zone\", this was the only one produced.\n\nMr. Rogers, the widowed father of three children (Anne, Karen, and Tom), is dealing with the departure of Aunt Nedra, who says the children are too hard to manage. The father takes the kids to a factory, Facsimile Ltd., to select a new robotic grandmother. When she arrives, young Tom and Karen quickly are smitten by the magical \"grandmother.\" But older daughter Anne will not accept her; \"Grandma\" reminds her too much of her own mother, who died and left her a bitter young girl. Anne tries to run away, and runs into the path of an oncoming van which she doesn't see. Grandma pushes Anne out of the way and is struck, saving the girl. Grandma is stunned, but the sturdily constructed robot soon gets up, and Anne grows to love her when she realizes that Grandma is indestructible and will not leave them like their own mother had. Mr. Rogers also realizes how empathetic Grandma can be when she correctly deduces that he lost his own mother at a young age and, like Anne, never forgave her.\n\nThe children grow up and are ready for college. However, it is time for Grandma to move on to another family as she is apparently not needed anymore. Grandma expresses her sadness about leaving, yet reassures the kids that they brought her just as much joy as she brought them. She will return to the factory where she will either be sent to another family, or possibly have her mind stored where she and the other grandmothers like her can talk and share their experiences. After repeating this process many times, if she keeps being a good grandmother to other children, she ultimately will be rewarded with the gift of life and humanity. The kids say their farewells, and Grandma leaves the house for good.\n\n\nIn addition to opening and closing the show as usual, Rod Serling's narration occurs in the middle of the story, to describe how the children spent years happily with their Gynoid grandmother and eventually grow up.

It is one of the 12 revered Jyotirlinga shrines of Shiva. It is on an island called Mandhata or Shivapuri in the Narmada river; the shape of the island is said to be like the Hindu ॐ symbol.\n\nThere are two main temples of Lord Shiva here, one to Omkareshwar (whose name means \"Lord of Omkaara or the Lord of the Om Sound\") located in the island and one to Amareshwar (whose name means \"Immortal lord\" or \"lord of the Immortals or Devas\") located on the south bank of Narmada River on the mainland.\n\nAs per Shiv Mahapuran, once Brahma (the Hindu God of creation) and Vishnu (the Hindu God of Protection and Care) had an argument in terms of supremacy of creation. To test them, Shiva pierced the three worlds as a huge endless pillar of light, the \"jyotirlinga\". Vishnu and Brahma split their ways to downwards and upwards respectively to find the end of the light in either directions. Brahma lied that he found out the end, while Vishnu conceded his defeat. Shiva appeared as the second pillar of light and cursed Brahma that he would have no place in ceremonies while Vishnu would be worshipped until the end of eternity. The \"jyotirlinga\" is the supreme partless reality, out of which Shiva partly appears. The \"jyothirlinga\" shrines, thus are places where Shiva appeared as a fiery column of light. Originally there were believed to be 64 \"jyothirlingas\" while 12 of them are considered to be very auspicious and holy. Each of the twelve \"jyothirlinga\" sites take the name of the presiding deity – each considered different manifestation of Shiva. At all these sites, the primary image is \"lingam\" representing the beginningless and endless \"Stambha\" pillar, symbolizing the infinite nature of Shiva.\n\nThe twelve \"jyothirlingas\" are Somnath in Gujarat, Mallikarjuna at Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh, Mahakaleswar at Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh, Omkareshwar in Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh, Kedarnath in Himalayas, in Uttrakhand state, Bhimashankar in Maharashtra, Viswanath at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, Triambakeshwar near Nashik in Maharashtra, Vaidyanath Jyotirlinga, Deogarh in Jharkhand, Nageswar at Dwarka in Gujarat, Rameshwar at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu and Grishneshwar near Aurangabad, Maharashtra in Maharashtra.\n\nAs per Hindu legend, Vindya, the deity controlling the Vindyachal mountain range was worshipping Shiva to propitiate himself from the sins committed. He created a sacred geometrical diagram and a Lingam made of sand and clay. Shiva was pleased with the worship and believed to have appeared in two forms, namely Omkareshwar and Amaleswara. Since the mud mound appeared in the form of Om, the island came to be known as Omkareswar. There is a shrine for Parvati and Ganapati in the temple.\n\nThe second story relates to Mandhata and his son's penance. King Mandhata of Ikshvaku clan (an ancestor of Lord Ram) worshipped Lord Shiva here until the Lord manifested himself as a Jyotirlinga. Some scholars also narrate the story about Mandhata's sons-Ambarish and Muchukunda, who had practiced severe penance and austerities here and pleased Lord Shiva. Because of this, the mountain is named Mandhata.\n\nThe third story from Hindu scriptures says that once upon a time there was a great war between Devas (gods) and Danavas (demons), in which Danavas won. This was a major setback for Devas and hence Devas prayed to Lord Shiva. Pleased with their prayer, Lord Shiva emerged in the form of Omkareshwar Jyotirlinga and defeated Danavas.\n\nPhilosophy of Omkaar - Advait Matt says \"Omkaar\" is composed of two words, \"Om\" (sound) and \"Akaar\" (srishti). Both are one not two since Advait means \"not two\". Om \"beez mantra\" of \"Srishti\", itself is creator of \"Srishti\".\n\nAdi Shankara's Cave – Omkareshwar is said to be the place where Adi Sankara met his guru Govindapada in a cave. This cave can be found even today just below the Shiva temple where an image of Adi Shankara has been installed.\n\nIt is situated in the Khandwa district of Madhya Pradesh state in India. It is about 12 km from Mortakka in Madhya Pradesh. Omkareshwar is formed by the sacred river Narmada. This is one of the most sacred of rivers in India and is now home to one of the world's biggest dam projects. The temple is situated on Mandatha island on the banks of Narmada and river Kaveri (a tributary of Narmada). The island is in area and can be approached by boats.\n\n\n"}

Some of them supposedly have depictions of dinosaurs, and what is alleged to be advanced technology. These are recognised as modern curiosities or hoaxes.\n\nIn the 1960s Javier Cabrera Darquea began to collect and popularize the stones, obtaining many of them from a farmer named Basilio Uschuya. Uschuya, after claiming them to be real ancient artifacts, admitted to creating the carvings he had sold and said he produced a patina by baking the stone in cow dung.\n\nThe stones are composed of andesite. They vary in size from to . As a result of weathering, they have developed a thin patina. It consists of a weathering rind in which weathering has turned some of the feldspar into clay, resulting in a softer material, rated 3 to 4 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness, which can be scratched.\n\nThey are shallowly engraved with a variety of images, some directly incised, others by removing the background, leaving the image in relief. The images vary from simple pictures on one side of a pebble, up to designs of great complexity. Some of the designs are in styles which can be recognized as belonging to the Paracas, Nazca, Tiwanaku, or Inca cultures.\n\nSome of the images are of flowers, fish, or living animals of various sorts. Others appear to depict scenes which would be anachronistic in pre-Columbian art, such as knowledge of dinosaurs, advanced medical works and maps.\n\nArchaeological remains show evidence of Peruvian cultures going back for several thousand years. At some later stages, the whole of modern Peru was united into a single political and cultural unit, culminating in the Inca Empire, followed by the Spanish conquest. At other stages, areas such as the Ica Valley, a habitable region separated from others by desert, developed a distinctive culture of its own.\n\nExcavations in Ica Province were carried out in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by scholars such as Max Uhle, Julio C. Tello, Alfred L. Kroeber, William Duncan Strong and John Howland Rowe. None of them reported the discovery of carved andesite stones. Nevertheless, carved stones which had been looted by \"huaqueros\", grave robbers, began to be offered for sale to tourists and amateur collectors.\n\nOne of these collectors was Santiago Agurto Calvo, an architect by profession, who was Rector of the National University of Engineering in Lima. He organised searches in ancient cemeteries, and in August 1966 found such a stone in the Toma Luz sector, Callango district, in Ica Valley. The context corresponded to the Tiwanaku culture. He reported his discovery to the Regional Museum in Ica city, and was accompanied on further expeditions by its curator, the archaeologist Alejandro Pezzia Assereto. In September 1966 in Uhle Hill cemetery, De la Banda sector, Ocucaje District, they found, for the first time, an engraved stone with certain provenance in a tomb of the Paracas culture. This stone was fairly flat and irregular in shape, approximately in size. On it was carved a design which might be abstract, or could be taken as a flower with eight petals. Agurto published the discovery in a Lima newspaper.\n\nPezzia continued to search. In the San Evaristo cemetery in Toma Luz, he found a carved stone of similar size to the previous one, with a realistic image of a fish. The context dated the tomb to the Middle Horizon (600-1000 A.D.). In a grave not far away in the same cemetery, he found a stone with the fairly realistic design of a llama, in a context typical of the Ica culture. In 1968, Pezzia published his findings, including drawings and descriptions.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1966, Peruvian physician Javier Cabrera Darquea was presented with a stone that had a carved picture of a fish, which Cabrera believed to be of an extinct species. Cabrera's father had begun a collection of similar stones in the 1930s, and based on his interest in Peruvian prehistory, Cabrera began collecting more. He initially purchased more than 300 stones from two brothers, Carlos and Pablo Soldi, who also collected pre-Incan artifacts, and claimed they had unsuccessfully attempted to interest archaeologists in them. Cabrera later found another source of the stones, a farmer named Basilio Uschuya, who sold him thousands more. Cabrera's collection burgeoned, reaching more than 11,000 stones in the 1970s.\n\nCabrera published a book, \"The Message of the Engraved Stones of Ica\" on the subject, discussing his theories of the origins and meaning of the stones. In this he argued that the stones were evidence \"that man is at least 405 million years old\" and for what he calls \"gliptolithic\" man, humans from another planet. He said that \"Through the transplantation of cognitive codes to highly intelligent primates, the men from outer space created new men on earth.\" The Ica stones achieved greater popular interest when Cabrera abandoned his medical career and opened a museum to feature several thousand of the stones in 1996.\n\nIn 1973, during an interview with Erich von Däniken, Uschuya stated he had faked the stones that he had sold. In 1975 Uschuya and another farmer named Irma Gutierrez de Aparcana confirmed that they had forged the stones they gave to Cabrera by copying the images from comic books, text books and magazines. Later, Uschuya recanted the forging story during an interview with a German journalist, saying that he had claimed they were a hoax to avoid imprisonment for selling archaeological artifacts.\n\nIn 1977, during the BBC documentary \"Pathway to the Gods\", Uschuya produced an Ica stone with a dentist's drill and claimed to have produced a fake patina by baking the stone in cow dung. That same year, another BBC documentary was released with a skeptical analysis of Cabrera's stones, and the new-found attention to the phenomenon prompted Peruvian authorities to arrest Uschuya, as Peruvian law prohibits the sale of archaeological discoveries. Uschuya recanted his claim that he had found them and instead admitted they were hoaxes, saying \"Making these stones is easier than farming the land.\" He engraved the stones using images in books and magazines as examples and knives, chisels and a dental drill. He also said that he had not made all the stones. He was not punished, and continued to sell similar stones to tourists as trinkets. The stones continued to be made and carved by other artists as forgeries of the original forgeries.\n\nExcept in the rare cases that provenance is known, there is no reliable way of dating the stones. Thus, a stone of uncertain origin can never be used to establish a conclusion which would otherwise be considered unlikely. The stones have been used by some creationists to claim that humans lived in proximity with dinosaurs, which contradicts evidence that the extinction of dinosaurs predates mankind by approximately 66 million years. At least one major creationist source has rejected their use as an argument for creationism. Believers in ancient astronauts have also attempted to use the stones as evidence of a lost, advanced civilization brought to man from other planets and mytho-historians have claimed them as evidence that ancient myths are accurate histories, neither of which is a position supported in the scientific or academic communities.\n\nIn his \"Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis To The Walam Olum\", archaeologist Ken Feder commented \"The Ica Stones are not the most sophisticated of the archaeological hoaxes discussed in this book, but they certainly rank up there as the most preposterous.\"\n\n\n"}

This place earn the religious importance in Akilam from the event that, Ayya Vaikundar is given two Vinchais here by Narayana under the Sea; One just before the arrest of Vaikundar by Swathi Thirunal and the second after the completion of Thuvayal Thavasu.\n\nAlso, this is the place where the second phase of Thuvayal Thavasu is carried out by \"Thuvayal Pandarams\" after completing it in Vakaippathi for about six-months. Alongside of Swamithoppe, it attracts a huge amount of devotees annually across southern India.\n\nAfter the Trail with the King of Travancore, Vaikundar reached Swamithoppe and instructed his followers to go for the Thuvayal Thavasu at Vakaippathi. As per, 700 families participated in the mass-austrity. They completed a Tavam of six-months. Then as per the instruction of Ayya in the dream of one of the participants, they all moved to Mutta pathi.\n\nThat place was then owned by \"Siva Loganatha Iyer\" who worked in the palace of the King of Travancore. God appeared to him in his dream and order him to grant that land to the \"Thuvayal pandarams\". So he went to the spot where he wondered to witness the whole mass of 700 families. He by doubting the geniunity of their Tavam, he asked them that, \"\"If your austrity is true make all the coconuts from these trees to fall off. If so I will give away this land for you people to construct a temple.\"\" Hearing this they all pray sincerely towards God facing the Sea. Wonderfully, all the Coconuts fall of before the closure of the prayer. Iyer was moved by witnessing this scene and grant that of land for them.\n\nThis Mutta Pathi was the place where Krishna during the Dwapara Yuga, constructed a fort in order for protecting the Pandavas from the Kauravas and ruled over it. Akilam calls it as \" 'Muttappathi Nadu' \" and also treats this place with high Sacrement and importance.\n\nThis Pathi is located 14 km South-east to Nagercoil 3 km North to Cape Comorin in the Sea-shore. It was also located 7 km east to Swamithope. It also lies half-a-way between the historical Circular fort and the Kanyakumari the Southern tip of the Sub-continent. There is a direct bus service from Nagercoil to here. Mutta Pathi is located at \n\nThe present construction was established there and was under the direct control of the Payyan dynasty and later, due to some litigations, the land was auctioned by the government. Those who got the land in the auction conducted the daily Panividai. Now, their descendants conduct the panividai and administer the Pathi and is managed by a Trust. The sea near this place is called the \" 'milk-ocean' \". Theerthakkarai, located 0.6 km south-east of Muttapathi is the second holiest sea theertham as per Akilam. It was sanctified by the fact that the second as well as the third Vinchai to Vaikundar is offered here.\n\nRegarding religious importance, this Pathi is important next to Ambala Pathi and Swamithope pathi, since the second and third Vinchais, which are the important instructions for the incarnational activities of Vaikundar was given by Narayana from here. Also this center gains additionally the importance that, the Thuvayal thavasu was also held here, though the first phase of it was conducted in Vakaippathi. Then it was also important and sacred even before the incarnation of Vaikundar right from the Dwapara Yuga, Since Narayana as Krishna ruled this place.\n\nAs all other Pathis, also here in Mutta Pathi, the Palliyarai forms the inner and the central spot of the whole architecture. An inner corridor, which allows the worshippers to circum-ambulate, surrounds the Palliyarai. In front of this inner corridor, there is a hall in which the prayers are conducted. Sivayu Medai is located in the south of Palliyarai and the \"Vahana Purai\" (which house Vahanas) in the Far South. The Flag pole is placed some apart from Palliyarai. Then the Outer-corridor surrounds all these which allows the worshippers to circum-ambulate the whole Pathi.\n\nThough the Panividais are conducted thrice a day the special panividais are on every Sundays. The Kodiyetru thirunal is celebrated here during the Tamil Month of Panguni starting from the second Friday of Panguni and last for eleven days. The Thiru-eadu Vasippu here is celebrated here for seventeen days starting from the second Friday of the Tamil month of Karthigai.\n\nAnother important festival celebrated by Ayyavazhi followers centering Muttappathi is the Panguni Theertham. It is a One-day-festival celebrated on the Second Friday of Tamil month Panguni. On that day people from Swamithoppe march in great numbers to Muttapathi under the leadership of Payyan.\n\n\n"}

Her stage career lasted from 1916 until 1987, and she was performing on television in her nineties. Though never a star, she was a familiar face both on stage and screen. In addition to light comedy, she had a large repertory of Shakespearean roles.\n\nJoyce Carey was born Joyce Lilian Lawrence, the daughter of actor Gerald Lawrence, a handsome matinée idol who had been a juvenile in Henry Irving's Shakespeare company, and his wife, actress Lilian Braithwaite, a major West End star. Carey was educated at the Florence Etlinger Dramatic School.\n\nCarey made her stage debut in 1916, aged 18, as Princess Katherine in an all-female production of \"Henry V\". She joined Sir George Alexander's company at the St James's Theatre playing Jacqueline, a French countess, in \"The Aristocrat\". After a succession of West End roles in light comedy, Carey took on further Shakespearean parts, appearing at Stratford-upon-Avon as Anne Page, Perdita, Titania, Miranda and Juliet. Over the next few years she added Hermia, Celia and Olivia to her Shakespearean repertoire, in between regular appearance in West End comedies.\n\nHer first appearance in a Noël Coward play was as Sarah Hurst in \"Easy Virtue\" in New York in 1926. For most of the following seven years, her career was chiefly in New York, following a great success in \"The Road to Rome\" in 1927. In 1934 she wrote (pseudonymously), and acted a supporting role in, a comedy, \"Sweet Aloes\", which ran in London for more than a year. In 1936 she resumed her connection with Coward, playing a series of character roles in his cycle of short plays, \"Tonight at 8.30\" in London and New York. In 1938 she starred in the comedy play \"Spring Meeting\" in the West End.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Carey toured with John Gielgud for the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) bringing theatre to members of the armed forces at home and abroad, recreating some of her roles from \"Tonight at 8.30\". In 1942 she rejoined Coward to tour in his three newest plays, \"This Happy Breed\" as Sylvia, \"Blithe Spirit\" as Ruth, and \"Present Laughter\" as Liz – a character based partly on the actress herself. She later played all three roles in London. After the war she played in new Coward plays, \"Quadrille\" (with Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne) and \"Nude with Violin\" (with Gielgud in London and Coward in New York).\n\n\"The Times\" said of her film work: \"One role in a film written by Coward will remain always in the memory: with haughty disdain and an accent of fearful gentility Carey was the manageress of the station buffet in \"Brief Encounter\", who froze her customers and slapped down attempts at familiarity from Stanley Holloway's ticket collector.\" Carey's other Coward film roles were the petty officer's wife in \"In Which We Serve\" and Mrs Bradman in \"Blithe Spirit\". Her other films included \"The Way to the Stars\" and \"Cry the Beloved Country\".\n\nBetween 1976 and 1979 Carey starred in the popular ITV series \"The Cedar Tree\". Her last stage performance was in 1984, as Mrs Higgins in \"Pygmalion\", opposite Peter O'Toole; the critic Michael Coveney described her performance as plaintive and touching. She continued working on screen into her nineties, attracting enthusiastic notices for her portrayal of a frail old lady faced with eviction in Michael Palin's BBC play \"No 27\".\n\nShe was the subject of \"This Is Your Life\" in 1985 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.\n\n\"The Times\" commented in its obituary of Carey:\n\nCarey was awarded the OBE in 1982. She never married: she enjoyed the enduring friendship of Coward's adopted \"family\". When Coward received his knighthood in 1970, Carey, along with the costume designer Gladys Calthrop, accompanied him to the ceremony at Buckingham Palace. She died in London, aged 94.\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the powerful feudal family of the Orsini, belonging to its Pitigliano line.\n\nNiccolò di Pitigliano was born in Pitigliano, in the Maremma, the son of Aldobrandino Paioletti ll, Count of Pitigliano and his wife Bartolomea. He was the descendant of a Romano [\"Romanello\"] Orsini, Count of Nola, who had acquired the Signoria of the tiny Tuscan citystate of Pitigliano in 1293 by marrying Anastasia de Montfort, heiress of the Aldobrandeschi Lords of the city. His parents both came from different branches of the Orsini clan.\n\nEquipped with the reputation that comes from a famous name, the connections and dynastic links with many of the ruling families of Italy, and with their own private fief as a base, both Niccolò Paioletti, and his father Aldobrandino Paioletti made careers as mercenaries taking Condotte (mercenary contracts) with Florence, Siena, the Pope, and the Kingdom of Naples at various times.\n\nA chronological list of the Niccolò di Pitigliano's early contracts shows him moving among the same employers and taking service with the same State more than once.\n\nNiccolò di Pitigliano's significant Condotte were as follows:\n\n\nFrom 1495 until the end of his life Niccolò di Pitigliano remained in Venetian service as Governatore Generale delle Milizie Veneziane (Governor General of Venetian Forces). The highpoint of his career was the role that he played in the War between the Venetian Republic and the League of Cambrai.\n\nIn the first decade of the sixteenth century Pope Julius II planned to curb the power of Venice in northern Italy and had, to this end, created the League of Cambrai (named after Cambrai, where the negotiations took place), an alliance against the Republic that included, besides himself, Louis XII of France, Emperor Maximilian I, and Ferdinand I of Spain.\n\nOn 15 April 1509, King Louis XII of France left Milan at the head of a French army and moved rapidly into Venetian territory. To oppose him, Venice fielded an army under the command of Niccolò di Pitigliano and his cousin Bartolomeo d'Alviano (also a scion of the Orsini clan).\n\nDisagreements between Pitigliano and Alviano as the best way to stop the French advance prevented the two from uniting their forces to oppose the French. Consequently, when Louis crossed the Adda River in early May and Alviano advanced to meet him, Pitigliano, believing it best to avoid a pitched battle, moved away to the south.\n\nOn 14 May, Alviano confronted the French at the Battle of Agnadello; outnumbered, he sent requests for reinforcements to his cousin, who replied with orders to break off the battle and continued on his way. Alviano, disregarding the new orders, continued the engagement; his army was eventually surrounded and destroyed.\n\nPitigliano managed to avoid encountering Louis; but his mercenary troops, hearing of Alviano's defeat, had deserted in large numbers by the next morning, forcing him to retreat to Treviso with the remnants of the Venetian army.\n\nThe Venetian collapse was complete; Louis proceeded to occupy Venetian territory as far east as Brescia without encountering any significant resistance. The major cities that had not been occupied by the French—Padua, Verona, and Vicenza—were left undefended by Pitigliano's withdrawal, and quickly surrendered to Maximilian when Imperial emissaries arrived in the Veneto. \nJulius, having in the meantime issued an interdict against Venice that excommunicated every citizen of the Republic, invaded the Romagna and seized Ravenna with the assistance of the Duke of Ferrara, who had joined the League and seized the Polesine for himself.\n\nThe newly arrived Imperial governors, however, quickly proved to be unpopular. In mid-July, the citizens of Padua, aided by detachments of Venetian cavalry under the command of the proveditor Andrea Gritti, revolted; the landsknechts garrisoning the city were too few in number to mount effective resistance and Padua was restored to Venetian control on 17 July.\n\nThe success of the revolt finally pushed Maximilian into action. In early August, a massive Imperial army, accompanied by bodies of French and Spanish troops, set out from Trento into the Veneto. Because of a lack of horses, as well as general disorganization, Maximilian's forces would not reach Padua until September, giving Pitigliano the time to concentrate such troops as were still available to him in the city. The Siege of Padua began on 15 September; although French and Imperial artillery successfully breached Padua's walls, the defenders managed to hold the city until Maximilian, growing impatient, lifted the siege on 30 September and withdrew to Tyrol with the main part of his army.\n\nIn mid-November, Pitigliano returned to the offensive; Venetian troops easily defeated the remaining Imperial forces, capturing Vicenza, Este, Feltre, and Belluno. Although a subsequent attack on Verona failed, Pitigliano managed to destroy a Papal army under Francesco II of Gonzaga in the process.\n\nA river attack on Ferrara by the Venetian galley fleet under Angelo Trevisan failed, however, when the Venetian ships, anchored in the Po River, were sunk by Ferrarese artillery; and a new French advance soon forced Pitigliano to withdraw to Padua once again.\n\nThe War of the League of Cambrai continued, but in January 1510 Niccolò di Pitigliano died in Lonigo. He was interred in the Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo, a traditional burial place of the doges.\n\nNiccolò di Pitigliano was married twice.\n\nFirstly, in 1467, to Elena dei Conti Montalcino (died in Nola in 1504), with nine children including:\n\n\nHis connection with the Carafa family is shown by his presence in the \"Dispute of St. Thomas\" painted by Filippino Lippi in the Carafa Chapel, in the basilica of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, Rome.\n\nSecondly to Guglielmina, a commoner of humble birth, last attested to in a will of 1529.\n"}

In the early 13th century it belonged to the Aldobrandeschi family and by the middle of the century it had become the capital of the surrounding county.\n\nIn 1293 the county passed to the Orsini family, signalling the start of 150 years of on-again/off-again wars with Siena, at the end of which, in 1455, a compromise of sorts was reached: Siena acknowledged the status of county to Pitigliano, which in exchange placed herself under the sovereignty of Siena. \nFrom then onwards the history of Pitigliano resorbs into the gradually wider ambit first of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany (1562) then of the united Kingdom of Italy.\n\nPitigliano is home to a series of artificial cuts into the tufa rock to varying depths ranging from less than to over . At the bottom of these cuts (Italian: \"tagliate\") are carved channels, apparently for water, although some take the form of steps. The purpose of the cuts is not known: the three main theories are that they were roads, quarries, or water conveyance schemes; they radiate outward from the base of the butte of Pitigliano, down to the rivers then back to the top of the plateau that surrounds the town. A few very brief Etruscan inscriptions are said to have been found on the walls of the cuts, but are ill documented.\n\n\nFor several hundred years Pitigliano was a frontier town between the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and, to the south, the Papal States. For this reason, the town was home to a flourishing and long-lived Jewish community, mostly made up by people fleeing from Rome during the Counterreformation persecutions. Jews of the town used one of the caves for their ritual Passover matzoh bakery, the \"forno delle azzime\" described in detail in Edda Servi Machlin's \"Classic Cuisine of the Italian Jews.\" After the promulgation of racial laws under Nazi influence, all the Jews of the town reportedly escaped capture with the help of their Christian neighbors. Although there are almost no Jews left in town, not enough to provide a minyan, the synagogue (1598, with furnishings of the 17th and 18th centuries) is still officiated from time to time. It was restored in 1995.\n\nThe \"Tempietto\" (\"Small temple\") is a small cave, probably of natural origin but considerably reworked by human hands, lying a few hundred meters outside the central district, yet far above the Lente valley. Its purpose and builders remain unknown. Locally it is referred to as a \"paleochristian tempietto\", but this has never been confirmed; it must date to Late Antiquity or the early Middle Ages, although it may replace an Etruscan or Roman arcosolium.\n\nThe municipality area of Pitigliano, while presenting different local situations on the basis of 'topography is characterized by rather low winter temperatures, which can occur during prolonged periods, despite the daily maximum values are often pleasing. On the contrary, in summer the heat can be very intense, though usually accompanied by low Relative humidity.\n\nConsequently, the town has been classified in zone E with a sum of 2195 degree days, allowing the power of heating between October 15 and April 15, up to a maximum of 14 hours per day.\n\nAccording to data available for the 30-year average 1951–80 for the only weather station located within the municipal area and in the table below, the average annual temperature is about at above sea level in Pitigliano, while the average annual rainfall is .\n\n\n\n\n"}

The song was written by lead singer Ivan Doroschuk after he had been kicked out of a club for pogo dancing.\n\nThe song entered the Canadian top 50 in February 1983, peaking at number 11 on May 14. In the meantime, \"The Safety Dance\" was released in the US on March 16, but did not enter the US charts for a few months. When it finally did, the record became a bigger hit than it had been in Canada, spending four weeks at its peak position of number 3 in September and October 1983, and staying on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for 24 weeks. It also reached number 1 on \"Cash Box\", as well as number 1 on the \"Billboard\" Dance Chart. \"The Safety Dance\" found similar success in other parts of the world, entering the UK charts in August and peaking at number 6 in early November, and entering the New Zealand charts in November, eventually peaking at number 2 in early 1984. The song was also a massive success in South Africa, reaching No. 1 on the Springbok charts.\n\nThe writer/lead singer, Ivan Doroschuk, has explained that \"The Safety Dance\" is a protest against bouncers prohibiting dancers from pogoing to 1980s new wave music in clubs when disco was dying and new wave was up and coming. New wave dancing, especially pogoing, was different from disco dancing, because it was done individually instead of with partners and involved holding the torso rigid and thrashing about. To uninformed bystanders this could look dangerous, especially if pogoers accidentally bounced into one another (the more deliberately violent evolution of pogoing is slamdancing). The bouncers did not like pogoing so they would tell pogoers to stop or be kicked out of the club. Thus, the song is a protest and a call for freedom of expression.\n\nIn 2003, on an episode of VH1's \"True Spin\", Doroschuk responded to two common interpretations of the song. Firstly, he explained \"The Safety Dance\" is not a call for safe sex, and that this interpretation is \"people reading into it a bit too much\". Secondly, he explained that it is not an anti-nuclear protest song \"per se\" despite the nuclear imagery at the end of the video. Doroschuk stated that \"it wasn't a question of \"just\" being anti-nuclear, it was a question of being anti-establishment.\"\n\nThe music video for the song (which uses the shorter single version), directed by Tim Pope, is notable for its English folk revival imagery, featuring Morris dancers, Mummers, Punch and Judy and a maypole. It was filmed in the village of West Kington, in Wiltshire, England. Ivan Doroschuk is the only member of the band actually to perform in the video. Doroschuk, and others in the video, can be seen repeatedly forming an \"S\" sign by jerking both arms into a stiff pose, one arm in an upward curve and the other in a downward curve, apparently referring to the first letter in \"safety\". The Morris dancers seen in the video were the Chippenham Town Morris Men, performing a dance called Monkton Park. The dwarf actor is Mike Edmonds, whose T-shirt in the video shows the \"Rhythm of Youth\" album cover. The identity of the young blonde woman by the name of Jenny seen dancing in the video remained unknown until 2013, when she was identified as Louise Court, a journalist who was editor-in-chief at \"Cosmopolitan\" and became a director at Hearst Magazines UK in 2015.\n\nIn 1984, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic released a parody of \"The Safety Dance\" entitled \"The Brady Bunch\" on his album \"In 3-D\".\n\nIn 2010, a Lipton iced tea commercial featuring Hugh Jackman included The Feeling's version of the song playing in the background.\n\nThe song was featured in the 1996 film \"Bio-Dome\", and a remix of the same song also appeared on its soundtrack.\n\nThe song was featured in the \"Family Guy\" episode \"Ocean's Three and a Half\", in which Peter Griffin and Glenn Quagmire were dancing to the song.\n\nThe song is performed in \"Dream On\", a first-season episode of the TV series \"Glee\". In the episode, wheelchair user Artie (Kevin McHale) fantasizes about being able to dance and leading a flash mob performance of the song in a shopping mall.

Deaths of pedestrians and cyclists are included, but deaths from vehicular accidents not on legal roads (e.g. on farms) are excluded.\n\nThe New Zealand road toll has exhibited a downward trend since the late 1980s through to 2010, which was attributed to a number of factors:\n\nRoad toll statistics are available from as far back as 1921, when records began. Here are some figures from the last few years (dashes indicate figures not published or unavailable).\n\nRoad deaths and injuries per capita since 2000.\n\nA break down of the types of road users involved in the road death toll since 2010.\n\nThe following table gives the number of road toll deaths by age group from 2010. The total killed includes unknown aged fatalities.\n\nLocal Body boundary changes mean that records have been kept from 1980 onwards. In November 2010, the Auckland Super City was established. The figures have been altered for Auckland and other regions to allow for this development.\n\nOverseas licence holders are involved in just over 6 percent of fatal and injury crashes. In 2016 overseas drivers (those with an overseas drivers licence) were involved in 24 fatal traffic crashes, 114 serious injury crashes and 506 minor injury crashes. In comparison, in total in New Zealand in 2016, there were 286 fatal crashes, 2,099 serious injury crashes and 7,583 minor injury crashes. Over the five years from 2012-2016, 6.2 percent of fatal and injury crashes involved an overseas driver. Over the same period, 4.1 percent of all drivers involved in crashes were overseas drivers.\n\nIn Australia the road toll is reported at a state level. Similar to New Zealand, Australia also reports national figures for special holidays, though usually only for the Christmas and Easter holiday periods.\n\nIn 2010, 1367 people lost their lives in road traffic crashes in Australia. While strategies to reduce road toll, including legislation, improvements to vehicle's which help to make them safer, and educational programs have been developed by the national government, under the 1992 Road Safety Strategy, it is up to the local governments to adopt and enforce these policies. The state of Victoria has implemented several initiatives such as speed camera, random alcohol breath tests, and an integrated state trauma system, which have successfully reduced the number of deaths caused by road traffic crashes.\n\nRandom breath testing (\"RBT\"), utilized throughout Australia, differs from the sobriety check-points commonly used in other countries. In Australia, random breath testing is accomplished by setting up a highly visible road block, wherein all drivers passing through are asked to take an alcohol breath test, regardless of whether there is any cause to believe the driver has been drinking. RBT was shown to reduce alcohol related road toll by 8–71% in fourteen different studies reviewed by Dr. Corinne Peek-Asa. Requiring motorists and passengers to wear seat belts appears to have reduced the road toll in Australia.\n\n\n"}

The Ari Gopalan Citar, who wrote the Akilam was born here. \n\nThere is a belief that Ari Gopalan Citar himself established the present constructions of the Pathi. This was considered as a Pathi because the Akilam was written down here, which was one among the incarnational activities of Vaikundar. When Ayya Vaikudar came out from the sea (after his first vinchai) he decided and planned to do meditation at here only. This is the first place he visited and started his first pathi. This is the First pathi in the All Pancha pathi's. During the times of Ayya, he was taken once in a year in a Vahana by the devotees to this Pathi.\n\nLike the other Pathis, the Panividais are conducted thrice a day the special panividais are on every Sundays. The Kodiyettru Thirunal is celebrated here during the Tamil month of Panguni starting from the second Friday of Panguni and last for eleven days. The Thirdu Eadu-vasippu here is celebrated here for seventeen days in the Tamil month of Karthigai. It was at the same time the same festival is conducted in Swamithope pathi. Since the Akilam was written down here, only during this fest the pathi is considered with high sacrament than Swamithope pathi. The Original Palm-leaf version of Akilam is readout here for seven days. Then worshippers as procession, used to bring it to Swamithoppe pathi on last Sunday of the Tamil Month of Karthigai and after completing it reading for seventeen days again return it to Thamaraikulam pathi and complete it by reading the rest in ten days. \n\nAnother important festival celebrated by Ayyavazhi followers centering Thamaraikulam Pathi is the 'Vahana bhavani' (procession carrying Ayya in a Vahana) to Thamaraikulam from Swamithope pathi. It is a One-day-festival celebrated on the last Sunday of Tamil month Panguni. On that day people from Swamithoppe march in great numbers to Muttapathi under the leadership of Payyan carrying Ayya in a Vahana. It was in practice right from the time of Vaikundar.\n\nThis Pathi is located 8 km South-east to Nagercoil 7 km North-west to Kanyakumari. It was also located 2 km south to Swamithope. It also lies 3 km west to the historical Agastheeswaram. There is a direct bus service from Nagercoil and Kanyakumari to here.\n\nThis is the place where Ayya commissioned the Citar to write down the Akilam by telling the first sullable of 'The Kappu', of Akilam, it was considered with equal importance with other Pathis. Also Akilam too accredit it as a 'Pathi'.\n\nAs all other Pathis, the Palliyarai here forms the inner and the central structure of the whole architecture. An inner corridor, which allows the worshippers to circum-ambulate, surrounds the Palliyarai. In front of this inner corridor, there is a hall in which the prayers are conducted. Sivayu Medai is located in the south-east of Palliyarai.\n\nDue to lot of issues now the temple is under administration/control of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department, however daily panividai and festivals are handled by traditional Thamarai pathi parambarai Guru family members. Now the situation is better since its administrated by Government of Tamilnadu (Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department) and village separatists are not involved in temple administration. \n\n\n"}

Common in the western world, for example, are statues of Lady Justice representing justice, traditionally holding scales and a sword, and the statues of Prudence, representing Truth by holding a mirror and squeezing a serpent.\n\nThis approach of using human form and its posture, gesture and clothing to wordlessly convey social values and themes.\nIt may be seen in funerary art as early as 1580. They were used on Renaissance monuments when patron saints became unacceptable. Particularly popular were the four cardinal virtues and the three Christian virtues, but others such as fame, victory, hope and time are also represented. The use of allegorical sculpture was fully developed under the École des Beaux-Arts. It is sometimes associated with Victorian art, and is commonly found in works dating from around 1900.\n\n"}
{"id": "2026464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026464", "title": "Families (TV series)", "text": "Families (TV series)\n\nFamilies was a daytime soap opera, which was on ITV from 1990 to 1993 and created by Kay Mellor. It followed two families; the Thompsons, based in Cheshire, England (in the fictional market town of Westbury), and the Stevens, living in Sydney. It was produced and recorded at Studio 6 at Granada Studios in Manchester.\n\nThe link in the storyline was businessman Mike Thompson (Malcolm Stoddard), who walked out on his family on his birthday and flew to Australia to be with his true love Diana Stevens (Briony Behets), whom he had left years earlier. Unbeknownst to Mike, Diana had given birth to his son Andrew (Tayler Kane) and as complications ensued over the abrupt life changes for both families, Andrew travelled to England, where he met Mike's daughter, Amanda (Laura Girling), by his English wife Sue (Morag Hood), and they fell in love, not realising that they were half-brother and sister. This plot line was somewhat similar to the opening storyline of the popular Australian soap opera \"Sons and Daughters\" which had successfully aired on ITV daytime since 1983.\n\nIt was broadcast twice a week (Monday and Tuesday) at 3.20 pm with the first episode broadcast on 23 April 1990. Both episodes were also repeated on Thursday 10.40 pm in the Granada TV region as part of Granada's \"10.40-extra\" strand. After two years, stories involving the Thompson and Stevens families—and the UK-Australian crossover angle—had run their course, with several characters either dead or left for pastures new (typically Brighton or Canberra). In their place came the wealthy Bannerman family, who were introduced during the summer of 1992, as they moved into the Thompsons' Cheshire mansion from a suburb of Manchester. In addition, some of the remaining Australian-based characters (including Diana Stevens and her husband Anton Vaughan) were re-located to England.\n\nThe series subsequently followed the intrigues involving the new family. Head of the Bannerman household was successful barrister Charles (Terence Harvey). The rest of the family comprised Charles' decorative wife Isabelle (Helen Bourne) and their four children—upstanding heir to the family law firm Simon (Thomas Russell), irresponsible teenager Matthew (Oliver Milburn), angelic countrywoman Rebecca (Karen Westwood) and beautiful go-getting vamp Juliette (Emma Davies). Juliette's best friend and Simon's fiancée Fiona Lewis (Claire Marchionne) also appeared, and turned out to be Charles' mistress.\n\nTo add balance to the series, the Richards family, who ran the local pub (The Railway), were also prominently featured, having been introduced during the latter Thompson family era in April 1991. They comprised: Larry (John Bowe), Jane (Margot Leicester) and daughters Chelsea (Tara Moran) and Louise (Victoria Finney). A son David was mentioned but never seen on-screen, as he lived in the US. Also present was Jane's sister Jackie Williams (Amanda Wenban) who had emigrated to Australia years earlier but was visiting Jane when the Richards family was first introduced. On her return to her own family in Sydney, she helped continue the UK-Australian crossover angle for a further year.\n\nThe Granada-produced soap ceased production in July 1993, to make way for daytime repeats of \"Coronation Street\" and \"Emmerdale\". The last show episode of 320 was broadcast in August 1993. It had a dramatic feature length finale which saw a birth, a possible suicide and a large and unexpected inheritance.\n\nThe theme music was by Matthew Scott. Several of those who worked on the series later went on to higher-profile careers: Jude Law was a regular cast member for two years (as Nathan Thompson) and Russell T Davies wrote for the programme. Amanda Wenban went from Families to star in the Yorkshire Television soap \"Emmerdale\" before heading back to Cheshire to play the role of Ruth Tyler in the second series of Russell T Davies' camp and ironic late night soapy-drama \"Revelations\".\n\nThe show was filmed in north east Cheshire and Altrincham. Much of the UK/Australia plot was directed by Nicholas Ferguson, with all of the interior scenes shot in the Granada studio in Manchester. Cicely Mill in the village of Rostherne, Cheshire, was used as the Thompson/Bannerman house. The stables where Amanda and subsequently Rebecca ran their business were in the nearby Tatton Park estate (the stables have since been converted into a coffee shop/restaurant). The Thompsons' garage was Ashley Smithy Garage in Ashley and The Railway Pub can be found in Heatley. Fiona Lewis and Simon Bannerman got married in St Oswald's church, Lower Peover (which also featured in \"Revelations\") and the aborted first wedding of Amanda Thompson and Neil Brooks was in St Mary's church, Nether Alderley.\n\nThe show was unusual for a daytime soap, regularly tackling subjects that at the time would have been deemed controversial for a prime time soap. These included murder, suicide, incest, drugs, adultery, prostitution, mental health problems and homosexuality. It also contained some strong language and scenes of a sexual nature, all of which were screened, in most ITV regions, just before children's TV started at 15.50. In its later months the show was screened at 14.45–15.15.\n\nThe series was given a full repeat on Granada Plus, when it launched on 1 October 1996, usually screened weeknights at 18:30. The run concluded on Friday 26 June 1998 and was replaced by Emmerdale from Monday 29 June 1998, with episodes beginning from 1989.\n\n\n"}

As the incarnational activity of Vaikundar, the marriage with Poomadanthai, the Goddess of Earth was the event took place here. This Poomadanthai was the final deity unified by Vaikundar into himself, symbolizing the destruction of Kali from the world (earth). \n\nAlso some historians view that this was previously a Siva temple from which it was changed as a Pathi.\n\nThe village Soorangudi is situated east to Eathamozhi in Kanyakumari district. Once a rich man named \"Sri rangan\" lived there, who had one and only daughter. After she matured she remained only in the house, since during those days young ladies were not allowed to come out of the residence. At that time, informed by Vaikundar about the divine birth of such a virgin, the Citars of Vaikundar went to Sri rangan's house with a proposal for her from Vaikundar who was then acting as a Pandaram. \n\nThey told the details about Vaikundar to Sri rangan. The moment he heard that the man for whom the people had come for, is an Age-old person, he grew angry and along with his work men, he attacked them severely and tied them in a pillar. \n\nThen following a dialogue with the wisemen of the village, he released them. The citars came weeping, and walked eastwards to meet Vaikundar. At that time they meet Vaikundar at a place called Naraiyan vilai. Ayya seated under the shade of Laurel trees and asked about the happenings. Citars told what had happened. Hearing this Vaikundar told that, \"\"My women will come here.\"\" At the next moment the daughter of \"Sri rangan\" went there with her hair uncombed. Following her a group of people came. \n\nFollowing them, \"Sri rangan\" and his wife came running and fell on the feet of Vaikundar and said, \n\n\"\"Your holiness, she was the one and only daughter given by God to us. She took only vegetarian food right from here childhood. She led a divine life by bathing and worshipping twice a day. She was not interested in marriage. Under such circumstance, when thine Citars came with the proposal addressing thineself as a Pandaram, I grew angry. When I beat them, my daughter cried out as if all beatings fall on her. Afterwards we can't control her and she ran towards here. So please pardon us. Please accept her.\"\" \n\nHearing this, Vaikundar advised him for his ignorance of the divine birth of his daughter. he told that she was the incarnation of the Bhooma Devi the goddess of Earth. She was performing austerity towards God to marry her and to unify her into himself. And so fulfilling that, the above drama is played. \n\nVaikundar married her under the shade of the laurel trees. The trees threw flowers over the couple, wishing them well. The devas praised the couple and threw flowers over them, and since then that place is called \"Poo Pathi\", where \" 'Poo' \" means flower in Tamil Language. Afterwards, Ayya along with Bhooma devi returned to Swamithoppe, where the followers gave them a warm welcome.\n\nLater the devotees established a Pathi at this place and it is called as Poo pathi. Festivals are conducted every year and this temple is owned by the village and maintained by the village committee. Poopathi is located about ten kilometers south of Nagercoil near Eathamozhi.\n\nAlso apart from 'The Great Masi Procession' from Nagercoil to Swamithope pathi, There is also a procession conducted from Poo Pathi to Ambala Pathi, which was organised by unifying the different processions from western parts of Kanyakumari district. \n\nThe Thiru Eadu-Vasippu is conducted here starting from 2nd of the Tamil Month of Karthigai and will continue for about seventeen days. The celebration of Ayya Vaikunda Avatharam is celebrated for two days here on 19th and the 20th of the Tamil Month of Masi. Anna dharmam is conducted during all festival days. Bus facility is available for this Pathi from Nagercoil. \n\nThe special feature here is the Laurel trees. And Ayya unified Poomadanthai into him only under the shade of these laurel trees. Also some historians view that, this was once a Siva temple. Ayya Vaikundar changed it as Poo Pathi. The previous temple was called as \"Kalaswami temple\". Presently there is the tomb of Kala Swami, west to the present Pathi. The Pathi is facing east ward. There is an old pipal tree on the front of the Pathi.\n\nPoo Pathi is situated near Naraiyan vilai, 4 km east to Eathamozhi in a natural atmosphere. This Pathi is situated 14 km west to Kanyakumari and 7 km south to Nagercoil. It also lies half-a-way between the towns of Muttom and Kanyakumari in the Western Coastal Road.

The 96-page story, depicting the revamped origins of former Fawcett Comics superhero Captain Marvel, was followed by an ongoing series, also titled \"The Power of Shazam!\", which ran from 1995 to 1999.\n\nAfter a previous retcon by Roy Thomas and Tom Mandrake in 1987 with the \"\" miniseries, Captain Marvel was again given a revised origin in the 1994 graphic novel \"The Power of Shazam!\". \nCaptain Marvel's origin would also be retold in Jeff Smith's \"Shazam!: The Monster Society of Evil\" limited series in 2007, though this origin takes place outside of DC continuity.\n\nAs \"The Power of Shazam!\" graphic novel opens, ten-year-old Billy Batson's parents, both archeologists, are working in Egypt, excavating the tomb of Ramses II with their associate Theo Adam. Murdering the elder Batsons, Adam also kidnaps their young daughter Mary and steals a scarab necklace once attached to one of the sarcophagi in the tomb. Billy had been left behind at home in Fawcett City because of poor school grades. As in the Fawcett Comics origin story from \"Whiz Comics\" #2 (1940), Billy is abandoned by his cruel uncle Ebenezer, and becomes a paperboy to earn a living. One night, Billy meets a dark-clothed stranger outside of a subway tunnel, and follows the stranger onto a magic subway car. The subway car leads Billy to the realm of the Wizard Shazam, who assigns the boy as his successor. By speaking Shazam's name, Billy is struck by a bolt of magic lightning and transformed into Captain Marvel, an adult superhero.\nAs Captain Marvel, Billy thwarts a plan by Theo Adam and his employer, the rich tycoon Doctor Sivana, to destroy the WHIZ radio building and silence a witness to Adam's murders. Adam's encounters with Marvel, who is the \"spitting image of C.C. Batson\", along with the clues from the expedition, lead him to realize he is the reincarnation of Teth-Adam, the original heir to the power of Shazam. Upon crossing the Wizard, Teth-Adam was killed and his powers drawn into a scarab, the very same scarab that Adam stole from the tomb after killing the Batsons. Taking the scarab from Sivana's trophy room, Adam says the Wizard's name and is struck by magic lightning, becoming Black Adam.\n\nAdam and Captain Marvel battle each other on the grounds of the Sivana-funded Fawcett World Fair, with Marvel winning the battle by snatching Adam's scarab from him. Marvel takes Adam to the Wizard, who takes Adam's voice and wipes his memory. Billy later learns that the stranger who led Billy to the Wizard was the spirit of his father, and that his sister Mary is still alive. Billy promises, as Captain Marvel, to fight injustice and evil, and also to find his missing sister. Meanwhile, Sivana has lost all of his money and possessions due to the destruction of his properties by Marvel and Adam, and swears revenge on the Captain.\n\nOrdway's graphic novel was a success, winning the Comics Buyer's Guide Fan Award for Favorite Original Graphic Album of 1994, and led to the publication of an ongoing \"Power of Shazam!\" series, set four years after the graphic novel. The series, which began publication in March 1995, reintroduced many of the characters from Fawcett Comics into current DC continuity, including Mary Bromfield/Mary Marvel, Freddy Freeman/Captain Marvel, Jr., Beautia Sivana, Mister Tawky Tawny, Bulletman, Minute-Man, Spy Smasher, Ibis and Taia, and even Hoppy the Marvel Bunny. Villains reincarnated in the series included Ibac, Mister Mind, Mister Atom, Aunt Minerva, and Blaze and Satanus from the \"Superman\" titles, who were retconned as the wizard Shazam's illegitimate children.\n\nMary Marvel was introduced as an adult instead of in her traditional teenage form, and insisted upon sharing the name of \"Captain Marvel\" with her brother. Captain Marvel, Jr., resenting being called \"Junior\" all of the time and needing a name he could say without calling down the magic lightning (his magic word being \"Captain Marvel\"), renamed himself \"CM3\". Jerry Ordway wrote all of the stories for the series and one annual, and provided painted covers in the style of the graphic novel as well. Peter Krause, Mike Manley, Dick Giordano, and Ordway himself served as the series' main artists.\n\nWhile the series received good reviews and featured guest artwork from comic book icons such as Curt Swan and Gil Kane, sales for the Golden-Age inspired series slowed as it went on, as darker, more intense comics had become more popular by the 1990s than the Marvel Family's more light-hearted adventures. The book was canceled with issue number 47 in March 1999 (Issue #1,000,000 was published in November 1998 as part of the DC One Million event, giving the series a total of 48 issues published). One annual issue was published in 1996.\n\nIn January 2010, \"Power of Shazam!\" had a single issue revival (issue #48), (continuing from the Vol. 2 numbering) tying into DC's \"Blackest Night\" event. It involved Black Adam's dead protégé Osiris being reanimated as a Black Lantern, and battling his killer, the Apokoliptian crocodile man Sobek.

As a child he taught himself to play the piano and keyboard, going on to work in a music store. It was here that he met Michael Cretu and became lead keyboardist for Sandra, appearing prominently on her hit single Maria Magdalena.\n\nHe was a member of Sandra's band for a few more years, then moved with the Cretus to Ibiza. While there he became involved with Cretu's new project, Enigma, under the pseudonym of \"F. Gregorian\". Peterson contributed to their first album, \"MCMXC a.D.\", writing several tracks.\n\nPeterson left the group in 1991 and pursued work on Gregorian, a musical project co-founded by Thomas Schwarz and Matthias Meissner. The female vocals for this album were provided by The Sisters of Oz - a duo composed of Birgit Freud and Susana Espelleta, who was married to Peterson at the time. Soon after, he met English soprano Sarah Brightman and collaborated with her on her solo albums \"Dive\" through \"Symphony\".\n\nGregorian was re-invented later on in his career as a group performing chant arrangements of popular songs. Peterson's inspiration, as he stated in an interview, was the approaching new millennium and its spiritual aspect.\n\nIn 1997, Peterson collaborated with Israeli singer Ofra Haza, producing her last album \"Ofra Haza\". This album was very successful in Europe and the United States.\n\nOther artists whom Peterson has worked with include Princessa, Carolin Fortenbacher, Violet, and Sinsual (the last two of which have CDs in the works).\n\nOn 16 April 2009 \"Billboard\" reported that Peterson has filed a lawsuit at the Higher District Court in Hamburg against Google/YouTube, claiming that his music videos and other audiovisual repertoire were used illegally. In his lawsuit Peterson claims infringement of his copyrights and master rights. He states that more than 125 million streams of his productions - of which he owns the copyrights and master rights as author, publisher and producer - have been viewed, for which he never received payment from Google/YouTube.\nIn the \"Billboard\" interview Jens Schippmann, senior partner of the law firm Kamin & Wilke representing Peterson claimed the lawsuit has been necessary because Peterson never granted any synchronization rights and adaptation rights to GEMA as part of his membership agreement: \"The German legal situation is different to the Anglo-American copyright law because in Germany the copyright itself will always remain with the author and exploitation rights granted do not exclude the author from any decision regarding synchronization and adaptation because of the author's moral right,\" says Schippmann. \"My client did not assign any synchronization or adaptation rights to Google/YouTube and is therefore entitled to demand [they] cease and desist such usage [and] negotiate about demanding appropriate remuneration.\"\nLutz Melzer, junior partner at the firm: \"The lawsuit includes our demand for injunction, for information and accounting about the figures of the usage and the turnover, especially from advertising. In addition we demand for a court decision that any damages incurred by such exploitation have to be reimbursed by Google/YouTube. So far we cannot exactly compute the amount of such damages without additional information from YouTube but it seems that the damages will exceed a few million [U.S.] dollars solely in the Peterson case.\"\n\n"}

The bridge carries the A697 road across the Tweed.\n\nThe architect for the bridge was John Smeaton (responsible for the third Eddystone Lighthouse), working for the Tweed Bridges Trust. Construction lasted from July 1763 to 28 October 1766, when it opened to traffic.\n\nThe cost of the bridge was £6,000, with government grants available for the project and the shortfall covered by a mixture of local subscription and loans from Edinburgh's banks, which were to be paid back by the tolling system. There was controversy when the project's resident engineer, Robert Reid of Haddington, used some of the funds to build accommodation for himself, but the trustees were assuaged when Smeaton argued that the house would actually help support the bridge. It seems that Smeaton was sympathetic to Reid, believing him to be underpaid for his work.\n\nThe bridge underwent subsequent work, including the 1784 construction of a downstream weir as an anti-erosion measure, concrete reinforcement of the foundations in 1922, alterations in 1928, and major work in 1960–1961 to strengthen the bridge and widen the road.\n\nA plaque on the bridge commemorates the 1787 visit of the poet Robert Burns to the Coldstream. Of historical note is the toll house on the Scottish side of the bridge, which became infamous for the runaway marriages that took place there, as at Gretna Green, hence its name, the 'Wedding House' or 'Marriage House'. It ceased to be a toll bridge in 1826.\n\nThe Coldstream Bridge 'that part in England' (Northumberland) was Grade II* listed in 1952, being described in the English Heritage listing as \"an ambitious, well-proportioned, and carefully-detailed C18 bridge design.\"\n\nThe Coldstream Bridge '(that part in Scotland) over the Tweed' (Scottish Borders) was Category A listed in 1971, being described in the Historic Scotland listing as \"A very fine example of an 18th century bridge design by pre-eminent civil engineer John Smeaton, his first example of a bridge executed in fine dressed sandstone with classical detailing and forming a prominent structure in the landscape of the border between Scotland and England.\"\n\nThe bridge is made of \"squared and tooled sandstone blocks with ashlar dressings\". A circular oculus in the spandrel above each pier is filled in with whinstone rubble. The five main arches each have an arch band and a triple keystone; the arches grow larger and higher towards the bridge's centre. There is a smaller semicircular flood arch at either end, with pendent keystones. A weir named the Cauld immediately downstream of the bridge has protected it from erosion since 1785.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2026521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026521", "title": "Kinzua Bridge State Park", "text": "Kinzua Bridge State Park\n\nKinzua Bridge State Park is a Pennsylvania state park near Mount Jewett, in Hamlin and Keating Townships, McKean County, Pennsylvania in the United States. The park lies between U.S. Route 6 and Pennsylvania Route 59, along State Route 3011 just east of the Allegheny National Forest.\n\nKinzua Bridge State Park was chosen by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) and its Bureau of Parks as one of \"25 Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks\".\n\nThe park is noted as the site of the Kinzua Bridge spanning Kinzua Creek, original bridge built in 1882, subsequent bridge built in 1900 and destroyed in 2003 by a tornado. At the time it was built, the original (c. 1882) Kinzua Bridge was the highest, at , and longest, at , railway bridge in the world, given the distinction of being listed as a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark (the listing was in 1977). The Erie Railroad company originally owned and operated the bridge.\nWilliam Scranton, then governor of Pennsylvania, signed legislation creating Kinzua Bridge State Park in 1963, although the park did not officially open until 1970. In 1987, excursion trains of the Knox and Kane Railroad again began running on the bridge. The trains traveled from Kane with a trip through the Allegheny National Forest and made a stop on the bridge before returning to Kane.\n\nThe Knox and Kane Railroad offered excursion rail trips across the bridge until June, 2002, when it was closed for restoration. At approximately 3:20 p.m., July 21, 2003, a tornado from the east touched down at the park. The storm, classified as F-1 on the Fujita scale, tore down 11 of the 20 structure spans and nearby trees were snapped and uprooted. The failure was caused by badly rusted bolts holding the bases of the towers. The investigation reckoned that the whole structure oscillated laterally 4-5 times before fatigue broke the base bolts. The towers fell intact in sections, and they suffered impact damage with the ground. They have been left as they fell, and it is intended to make the ruins a visitor attraction to show the forces of nature at work.\n\nIn 2011, the engineering masterpiece was reinvented as the Kinzua Bridge Skywalk, a new pedestrian walkway where visitors can stroll 600 feet out on the remaining support towers, peer miles out into the Kinzua Gorge as well as peer down into the partial glass platform at the end of the walkway.\n\nA scenic view overlooks the fallen bridge and Kinzua Creek Valley. The overlook is also a prime location to view the fall foliage during the first two weeks of October. The park also has a shaded picnic area with a centrally located modern restroom.\n\nThere are of woods open to hunting at Kinzua Bridge State Park. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The common game species are black bears, eastern gray squirrel, white-tailed deer, and wild turkey. The hunting of groundhogs is prohibited.\n\nThe following state parks are within of Kinzua Bridge State Park:\n"}

{"id": "2026530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026530", "title": "Atlantic coastal pine barrens", "text": "Atlantic coastal pine barrens\n\nThe Atlantic coastal pine barrens is a now rare temperate coniferous forest ecoregion of the Northeast United States distinguished by unique species and topographical features (coastal plain ponds, frost pocket), generally nutrient-poor, often acidic soils and a pine tree distribution once naturally controlled by frequent fires.\n\nThis ecoregion once stretched from North Carolina to Nova Scotia but now covers a disjunct area with three remaining large, contiguous areas including, the largest, the New Jersey Pine Barrens on the coastal plain of New Jersey, the rapidly diminishing forests of southern Long Island in New York State, and the Massachusetts Coastal Pine Barrens which stretches from Plymouth, Massachusetts in Southeastern Massachusetts to Cape Cod and the Islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.\n\nThe pine barrens are underlain by sandy, nutrient-poor soils, which typically support stunted forests dominated by pines (\"Pinus\" spp.). The distinct flora of this ecoregion is maintained by the poor soils and frequent fires which revive the pines; surrounding areas with better soils are part of the Middle Atlantic Coastal Forests and Northeastern coastal forests ecoregion.\n\nThis ecoregion has a humid subtropical climate in Delaware, New Jersey, and Long Island, New York, and a humid continental climate in Massachusetts. 523,590 acres\n\nThe composition of the flora of the pine barrens is largely determined by fire frequency. Pitch-pine-dominated forests are the characteristic forests of this ecoregion, but where fires occur at intervals of 10 years or less, dwarf pine forests develop. Where fires are infrequent, oak-dominated forest develop. In wetland areas grow cedar swamp forests and hardwood swamp forests.\n\nPitch pine (\"Pinus rigida\") is the most abundant tree here. Shortleaf pine (\"Pinus echinata\") is also present, but not as abundant. In the southern regions of the New Jersey Pine Barrens, loblolly pine (\"Pinus taeda\") and pond pine (\"Pinus serotina\") are present and fairly commonly encountered. A variety of oaks grow among the pines, including black (\"Quercus velutina\"), white (\"Quercus alba\"), post (\"Quercus stellata\"), chestnut (\"Quercus prinus\"), scarlet (\"Quercus coccinea\"), and blackjack (\"Quercus marilandica\"). These forests tend to be open with widely spaced trees and plenty of sunlight reaching the forest floor.\n\nThe understory is thick with shrubs, including black huckleberry (\"Gaylussacia baccata\") and early lowbush blueberry (\"Vaccinium pallidum\"). Staggerbrush (\"Lyonia mariana\"), dangleberry (\"Gaylussacia frondosa\"), mountain laurel (\"Kalmia latifolia\"), and sheep laurel (\"Kalmia angustifolia\") also occur. Bracken fern (\"Pteridium aquilinum\") is abundant.\n\nThe only trees that can recover from frequent fires are pitch pine and blackjack oak, which are abundant here. Deprived of the opportunity to grow tall, these trees grow as shrubs that may only be tall.\n\nBlack huckleberry and early lowbush blueberry are again common here. Mountain laurel, sheep laurel, and bearberry (\"Arctostaphylos uva-ursi\") are also common.\n\nWithout fires, leaf litter accumulates, creating an environment that favors the establishment of oak seedlings instead of pine seedlings. In time, the pines grow old, die, and are replaced by oaks (\"Quercus\" spp.). The most common are black, scarlet, chestnut, white, and post oaks. Pitch and shortleaf pines are scattered among the oaks. The forest canopy tends to be closed.\n\nThe understory vegetation is similar to that of the pine-dominated forest, with black huckleberry, early lowbush blueberry, and dangleberry common.\n\nSwamp forests dominated by Atlantic white cedar (\"Chamaecyparis thyoides\") occur along the waterways of the pine barrens. The white cedars often grow from pools of standing water and, in contrast to the surrounding pine forests, considerably darken the understory. Amid the white cedars are red maple (\"Acer rubrum\"), sour gum (\"Nyssa sylvatica\"), pitch pine, and sweet bay magnolia (\"Magnolia virginiana\"). In openings and edges grow highbush blueberry, dangleberry, swamp azalea (\"Rhododendron viscosum\"), fetterbush (\"Eubotrys racemosa\"), and leatherleaf (\"Chamaedaphne calyculata\"). Sweet pepperbush (\"Clethra alnifolia\"), inkberry (\"Ilex glabra\"), and winterberry (\"Ilex verticillata\") are also present.\n\nSweet gum (\"Liquidambar styraciflua\") and red maple are the most abundant trees in the hardwood swamp forests. American holly (\"Ilex opaca\"), a broadleaf evergreen tree, is common. Pin oak (\"Quercus palustris\"), swamp white oak (\"Quercus bicolor\"), willow oak (\"Quercus phellos\"), tulip tree (\"Liriodendron tulipifera\"), sour gum, and sweet bay magnolia are associates.\n\nPoison ivy (\"Toxicodendron radicans\") and Japanese honeysuckle (\"Lonicera japonica\") are often abundant and grow in thickets. Shrubs include arrowwood (\"Viburnum dentatum\"), spicebush (\"Lindera benzoin\"), highbush blueberry (\"Vaccinium corymbosum\"), sweet pepperbush (\"Clethra alnifolia\"), and swamp azalea.\n\nThe region also contains areas of maritime grassland on Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, and out at the tip of Long Island that are unique in the United States (see Conscience Point National Wildlife Refuge for an example).\n\nWildlife adapted to this environment includes the Pine Barrens tree frog, Plymouth red-bellied turtle and Sabatia kennedyana. The beaches of these coast are important breeding grounds for piping plover (especially on Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, and Long Island) and roseate tern (especially on Bird Island).\n\nThe pine barrens ecosystems have been severely damaged by urban developments as the east coast has become built up with housing, including vacation and retirement properties. Only about 10% of original habitat remains and is very fragmented. Blocks of remaining habitat include: the New Jersey Pine Barrens; Long Island Central Pine Barrens in New York; and the Massachusetts Coastal Pine Barrens with concentrations in Myles Standish State Forest, Manuel F. Correllus State Forest on Martha's Vineyard, Cape Cod National Seashore and Joint Base Cape Cod and the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe in Massachusetts. These areas are now well conserved.\n\n\n"}

Ortolani and Oliviero originally composed it as an instrumental; lyrics were later provided by Marcello Ciorciolini, which were adapted into English by Norman Newell. It has become a pop standard.\n\nThe film \"Mondo Cane\" is a documentary, and uses a variety of music to accompany various segments. Some melodies are used repeatedly, in different styles, each named for the part of the movie where the music is used. Of the 15 music tracks on the soundtrack album, one melody is presented 6 times, another melody 2 times. The melody which became known as \"More\" is presented 4 times, named \"Life Savers Girls\", \"The Last Flight/L'Ultimo Volo\", \"Models In Blue/Modelle in Blu\", \"Repabhan Street/Repabhan Strasse\", in styles ranging from lush to march and 3/4 waltz.\n\n\"More\" is one of Ortolani's acclaimed and influential works. It won the 1964 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Theme. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 36th Academy Awards in 1964, where it was performed in English by Katyna Ranieri. The nomination led Ruggero Deodato to hire Ortolani to compose the score for his film \"Cannibal Holocaust\".\n\nKatyna Ranieri recorded “'Ti Guarderò Nel Cuore” with italian lyrics in 1962, with an orchestra conducted by the composer Ortolani, who was also her husband. It was issued as a 45rpm single by MGM. Ranieri sang “More” live in english at the 36th Academy Awards in 1964, where the song was nominated for an Oscar.\n\n\"More\" first caught U.S. attention as a pop instrumental hit by jazz trombone player Kai Winding that was arranged and conducted by Claus Ogerman, released as a single on Verve 10295. Popular in the summer and autumn of 1963, the record peaked at #2 on the Easy Listening chart and at #8 and lasted 15 weeks on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Rather than employing a traditional jazz instrument, the recording's melody was instead performed on the electronic Ondioline by Jean-Jacques Perrey. Verve retitled the parent album \"Soul Surfin'\" containing \"More\" and other songs performed by Winding's big band \"!!!!More!!! (Theme from Mondo Cane)\" to capitalise on the single's popularity. While Winding's brassy performances feature top jazz players, notably Kenny Burrell on guitar, the arrangements are in so-called \"surf music\" style.\n\nAfter Winding's recording became popular, United Artists added to the soundtrack cover a starburst stating \"INCLUDED IN THIS ALBUM THE HIT SONG \"MORE\".\n\nA vocal version of \"More\" by Vic Dana stalled at #42 in early October 1963, two weeks before Winding's rendition dropped off the Billboard chart. But the song did much better over the years, recorded hundreds of times by many artists, ranging from Frank Sinatra to the Baja Marimba Band. It is now considered a pop standard.\n\nA 1976 cover by Carol Williams on the Salsoul label was popular when disco was breaking into the mainstream and is seen as an early disco classic. “More” was the first 12-inch commercial single that one could buy in stores all over the world. It made #4 on the Disco Singles, #8 on the Dance Music/Club Play Singles and #98 on the R&B Singles.\n\nFrank Sinatra's swinging version, with accompaniment by Count Basie and his orchestra and arranged by Quincy Jones, is on his 1964 album \"It Might as Well Be Swing.\"\n\nDuke Ellington recorded a ballad version of the song on his \"Ellington '65\" album.\n\nNat 'King' Cole recorded a version on his 1965 album \"L-O-V-E\".\n\nSergio Franchi performed this song at many of his concerts, and on several TV shows (e.g. \"The Hollywood Palace\" on October 19, 1964).

In 1878 in Vienna it was called \"Naïla, die Quellenfee\" (\"Naïla, the Waternymph\").\n\nThe choreography was by Arthur Saint-Léon, who collaborated with Charles Nuitter in the libretto. The original designs were by Édouard Desplechin, Jean-Baptiste Lavastre, Auguste Rubé, Chaperon (sets) and Paul Lormier (costumes). The first production opened at the Théâtre Impérial de l´Opéra in Paris on 12 November 1866, with Guglielmina Salvioni (Naïla), Eugenie Fiocre (Nouredda) and Louis Mérante (Djémil) in the principal roles. The production was not particularly successful, Salvioni being considered unsuited to the rôle of Naïla. It triumphed in the following year, however, with Adèle Grantzow as Naïla, and remained a mainstay of the repertory for the next few years. A successful revival in 1872 showcased Rita Sangalli in the principal rôle, and it was for this production that the new variations for Naïla were introduced, the music most likely by Delibes himself (Nos. 12b and 23a in the list of musical numbers in the piano score, see below).\n\nDelibes was second chorus master at the Paris Opera and had until then written operettas, songs and sacred music. A comparison of the music of the two composers greatly favoured Delibes, whose contributions were considered \"fresh and more rhythmic\", with one critic suggesting that the whole ballet score should have been assigned to Delibes. \"La source\" was his first big success, marking him as an important composer for the ballet.\n\n\"La source\" was produced in St Petersburg in 1902 with Olga Preobrajenska as Naïla, choreographed by Achille Coppini. In 1907 Nijinsky made his solo debut in the last act of \"La source\" at the Mariinsky.\n\nThe ballet was revived in 1925 by Agrippina Vaganova to the Theatre of Opera and Ballet in Leningrad to her pupil Marina Semyonova – Marina Semyonova started to work on the scene from this ballet.\n\nA video of the \"La source\" pas de deux taken from the 2008 graduation performance of the Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet at the Mariinsky Theatre, St. Petersburg, may be found on YouTube, the choreography credited to Konstantin Sergeyev after Coppini and possibly created for Preobrajenskaya; the music is by Riccardo Drigo, composer of most of the additional dances added to the company's repertory in the early 20th century.\n\nAct 1. On her way to marry the Khan of Ghendjib, the beautiful Nouredda and her accompanying party rest by a stream in a rocky desert. When Nouredda admires a flower which is growing in an inaccessible spot, Djémil, a young hunter, climbs up and picks it for her. Nouredda is thrilled and asks him to state whatever he wishes as his reward. He asks her to lift her veil so that he can see her face: in fury she orders that he be tied up and left to his fate. However, the nymph Naïla rescues him; she is in love with him and promises to help him win the hand of Nouredda.\n\nAct 2. In the grand palace gardens, where the court of Khan is awaiting Nouredda's arrival, entertainment is offered to the guests: a solo for the favourites and a dance for Circassian slaves. A fanfare proclaims a visitor, incognito (Djémil), who proffers presents for the Khan and his bride. The visitor asks Nouredda to choose any of the gifts and she selects a jewelled flower. Djémil throws it on the ground and magically a spring gushes forth from this spot and Naïla emerges from the fountain. She dances, entrancing the Khan, who kneels in front of her and he implores her to become his wife. She consents, provided he dismisses Nouredda, who angrily goes off as the Khan leads Naïla inside the palace.\n\nAct 3. Djémil can now pursue Nouredda but she still rejects him; so he appeals to Naïla, who says that if he gets Nouredda to love him she herself will die. Djémil agrees, and as he departs with Nouredda, Naïla disappears back into the earth and the spring dries up.\n\nAct 1 (Léon Minkus)\n\nAct 2 (Léo Delibes)\n\nAct 3, Scene 1 (Léo Delibes)\n\nAct 3, Scene 2 (Léon Minkus)\n\nDelibes was asked in 1867 to add a divertissement, known as either 'Le jardin animé' or 'Le pas des fleurs', to a revival of Adolphe Adam's ballet 'Le Corsaire'. Part of his contribution was the waltz frequently known as the 'Naïla' waltz. It appears that it was transferred to one of the productions of 'La Source' when it was performed under the name of 'Naïla'. There are references to a version of that name using only Delibes's original music, although exact details are elusive. One might assume that it was for this production that the 'Le Corsaire' divertissement found its way into the score of 'Naïla'.\n\nThree orchestral suites consisting of excerpts from the ballet were arranged either by Delibes or another hand. The 2nd suite contains some music by Minkus, although the suites are attributed to Delibes.\n\nSuite 1\n\nSuite 2\n\nSuite 3\n\nThe suites contain almost all of Delibes's contribution to \"La Source\", albeit arranged in an order designed for concert performance.\n\n\nComplete score (with cuts)\n\nSuites\n\nExcerpts from Delibes part of the score\n\nLe jardin animé – Delibes contribution to Adolphe Adam's 'Le Corsaire', including the 'Naïla' waltz\n\nThe CHARM database also lists other recordings of excerpts from the ballet: the Orchestre du Théâtre national de l'Opéra-Comique conducted by Albert Wolff (1956) for Pathé, and the Orchestre philharmonique de Paris conducted by Gustave Cloëz (1930) for Odéon.\n"}
{"id": "2026564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026564", "title": "Tissue paper", "text": "Tissue paper\n\nTissue paper or simply tissue is a lightweight paper or, light crêpe paper. Tissue can be made from recycled paper pulp.\nKey properties are absorbency, basis weight, thickness, bulk (specific volume), brightness, stretch, appearance and comfort.\n\nTissue paper is produced on a paper machine that has a single large steam heated drying cylinder (Yankee dryer) fitted with a hot air hood. The raw material is paper pulp. The Yankee cylinder is sprayed with adhesives to make the paper stick. Creping is done by the Yankee's doctor blade that is scraping the dry paper off the cylinder surface. The crinkle (crêping) is controlled by the strength of the adhesive, geometry of the doctor blade, speed difference between the Yankee and final section of the paper machine and paper pulp characteristics.\nTissue Paper Converting Machines with Jumbo Rolls attached.\n\nThe highest water absorbing applications are produced with a through air drying (TAD) process. These papers contain high amounts of NBSK and CTMP. This gives a bulky paper with high wet tensile strength and good water holding capacity. The TAD process uses about twice the energy compared with conventional drying of paper.\n\nThe properties are controlled by pulp quality, crêping and additives (both in base paper and as coating). The wet strength is often an important parameter for tissue.\n\nHygienic tissue paper is commonly used for facial tissue (paper handkerchiefs), napkins, bathroom tissue and household towels. Paper has been used for hygiene purposes for centuries, but tissue paper as we know it today was not produced in the United States before the mid-1940s. In Western Europe large scale industrial production started in the beginning of the 1960s.\n\nFacial tissue (paper handkerchiefs) refers to a class of soft, absorbent, disposable paper that is suitable for use on the face. The term is commonly used to refer to the type of facial tissue, usually sold in boxes, that is designed to facilitate the expulsion of nasal mucus although it may refer to other types of facial tissues including napkins and wipes.\n\nThe first tissue handkerchiefs were introduced in the 1920s. They have been refined over the years, especially for softness and strength, but their basic design has remained constant. Today each person in Western Europe uses about 200 tissue handkerchiefs a year, with a variety of 'alternative' functions including the treatment of minor wounds, the cleaning of face and hands and the cleaning of spectacles.\n\nThe importance of the paper tissue on minimising the spread of an infection has been highlighted in light of fears over a swine flu epidemic. In the UK, for example, the Government ran a campaign called \"Catch it, Bin it, Kill it\", which encouraged people to cover their mouth with a paper tissue when coughing or sneezing.\n\nPaper towels are the second largest application for tissue paper in the consumer sector. This type of paper has usually a basis weight of 20 to 24 g/m. Normally such paper towels are two-ply. This kind of tissue can be made from 100% chemical pulp to 100% recycled fibre or a combination of the two. Normally, some long fibre chemical pulp is included to improve strength.\n\nWrapping tissue is a type of thin, translucent tissue paper used for wrapping/packing various articles & cushioning fragile items.\n\nCustom-printed wrapping tissue is becoming a popular trend for boutique retail businesses. There are various on-demand custom printed wrapping tissue paper available online. Sustainably printed custom tissue wrapping paper are printed on FSC-certified, acid-free paper; and only use soy-based inks.\n\nRolls of toilet paper have been available since the end of the 19th century. Today, more than 20 billion rolls of toilet tissue are used each year in Western Europe.\n\nTable napkins can be made of tissue paper. These are made from one up to four plies and in a variety of qualities, sizes, folds, colours and patterns depending on intended use and prevailing fashions. The composition of raw materials varies a lot from deinked to chemical pulp depending on quality.\n\nColored paper napkins can be a source of carcinogenic primary aromatic amines (\"paA\"s) when used as a wrapper for food as a result of degradation of Azo compounds used as paper dyes.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, a sound recording engineer named Bob Clearmountain was said to have hung tissue paper over the tweeter of his pair of Yamaha NS-10 speakers to tame the over-bright treble coming from it.\n\nThe phenomenon became the subject of hot debate and an investigation into the sonic effects of many different types of tissue paper. The authors of a study for \"Studio Sound\" magazine suggested that had the speakers' grilles been used in studios, they would have had the same effect on the treble output as the improvised tissue paper filter. Another tissue study found inconsistent results with different paper, but said that tissue paper generally demonstrated an undesirable effect known as \"comb filtering\", where the high frequencies are reflected back into the tweeter instead of being absorbed. The author derided the tissue practice as \"aberrant behavior\", saying that engineers usually fear comb filtering and its associated cancellation effects, suggesting that more controllable and less random electronic filtering would be preferable.\n\nTissue paper, in the form of standard single-ply toilet paper, is commonly used in road repair to protect crack sealants. The sealants require upwards of 40 minutes to cure enough to not stick onto passing traffic. The application of toilet paper removes the stickiness and keeps the tar in place, allowing the road to be reopened immediately and increasing road repair crew productivity. The paper breaks down and disappears in the following days. The use has been credited to Minnesota Department of Transportation employee Fred Muellerleile, who came up with the idea in 1970 after initially trying standard office paper, which worked, but did not disintegrate easily.\n\nApart from above, a range of speciality tissues are also manufactured to be used in the packing industry. These are used for wrapping/packing various items, cushioning fragile items, stuffing in shoes/bags etc. to keep shape intact or, for inserting in garments etc. while packing/folding to keep them wrinkle free and safe. It is generally used printed with the manufacturers brand name or, logo to enhance the look and aesthetic appeal of the product. It is a type of thin, translucent paper generally in the range of grammages between 17 and 40 GSM, that can be rough or, shining, hard or soft, depending upon the nature of use.\n\nIn North America, people are consuming around three times as much tissue as in Europe.\nOut of the world's estimated production of of tissue, Europe produces approximately .\n\nThe European tissue market is worth approximately 10 billion Euros annually and is growing at a rate of around 3%. The European market represents around 23% of the global market. Of the total paper and board market tissue accounts for 10%. An analysis and market research in Europe, Germany was one of the top tissue-consuming countries in Western Europe while Sweden was on top of the per-capita consumption of tissue paper in Western Europe. \nMarket Study.\n\nIn Europe, the industry is represented by the \"European Tissue Symposium\" (ETS), a trade association. The members of ETS represent the majority of tissue paper producers throughout Europe and about 90% of total European tissue production. ETS was founded in 1971 and is based in Brussels since 1992.\n\nIn the U.S., the tissue industry is organized in the AF&PA.\n\nTissue paper production and consumption is predicted to continue to grow because of factors like urbanization, increasing disposable incomes and consumer spending. In 2015, the global market for tissue paper is growing at per annum rates between 8-9% (China, currently 40% of global market) and 2-3% (Europe).\n\nThe largest tissue producing companies by capacity - some of them also global players - in 2015 are (in descending order):\nThe paper industry in general has a long history of accusations for being responsible for global deforestation through legal and illegal logging. The WWF has urged Asia Pulp & Paper (APP), \"one of the world's most notorious deforesters\" especially in Sumatran rain forests, to become an environmentally responsible company; in 2012, the WWF launched a campaign to remove a brand of toilet paper known to be made from APP fiber from grocery store shelves. According to the Worldwatch Institute, the world per capita consumption of toilet paper was 3.8 kilograms in 2005. The WWF estimates that \"every day, about 270,000 trees are flushed down the drain or end up as garbage all over the world\", a rate of which about 10% are attributable to toilet paper alone.\n\nMeanwhile, the paper tissue industry, along with the rest of the paper manufacturing sector, has worked to minimise its impact on the environment. Recovered fibres now represent some 46.5% of the paper industry's raw materials. The industry relies heavily on biofuels (about 50% of its primary energy). Its specific primary energy consumption has decreased by 16% and the specific electricity consumption has decreased by 11%, due to measures such as improved process technology and investment in combined heat and power (CHP). Specific carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels decreased by 25% due to process-related measures and the increased use of low-carbon and biomass fuels. Once consumed, most forest-based paper products start a new life as recycled material or biofuel\n\nEDANA, the trade body for the non-woven absorbent hygiene products industry (which includes products such as household wipes for use in the home) has reported annually on the industry's environmental performance since 2005. Less than 1% of all commercial wood production ends up as wood pulp in absorbent hygiene products. The industry contributes less than 0.5% of all solid waste and around 2% of municipal solid waste (MSW) compared with paper and board, garden waste and food waste which each comprise between 18 and 20 percent of MSW.\n\nThere has been a great deal of interest, in particular, in the use of recovered fibres to manufacture new tissue paper products. However, whether this is actually better for the environment than using new fibres is open to question. A Life Cycle Assessment study indicated that neither fibre type can be considered environmentally preferable. In this study both new fibre and recovered fibre offer environmental benefits and shortcomings.\n\nTotal environmental impacts vary case by case, depending on for example the location of the tissue paper mill, availability of fibres close to the mill, energy options and waste utilization possibilities. There are opportunities to minimise environmental impacts when using each fibre type.\n\nWhen using recovered fibres, it is beneficial to:\nWhen using new fibres, it is beneficial to:\nWhen using either fibre type, it is beneficial to:\n\nThe Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI) has published reports focusing on the industry's environmental credentials. In 2002, it noted that \"a little over 60% of the pulp and paper produced in Europe comes from mills certified under one of the internationally recognised eco-management schemes\". There are a number of ‘eco-labels’ designed to help consumers identify paper tissue products which meet such environmental standards. Eco-labelling entered mainstream environmental policy-making in the late seventies, first with national schemes such as the German Blue Angel programme, to be followed by the Nordic Swan (1989). In 1992 a European eco-labelling regulation, known as the EU Flower, was also adopted. The stated objective is to support sustainable development, balancing environmental, social and economical criteria.\n\nIn 2019, the NRDC and Stand.earth released a report grading various brands of toilet paper, paper towels, and facial tissue; the report criticized major brands for lacking recycled material.\n\nThere are three types of eco-labels, each defined by ISO (International Organization for Standardization).\n\nType I: ISO 14024\nThis type of eco-label is one where the criteria are set by third parties (not the manufacturer). They are in theory based on life cycle impacts and are typically based on pass/fail criteria. The one that has European application is the EU Flower.\n\nType II: ISO 14021\nThese are based on the manufacturers or retailers own declarations. Well known amongst these are claims of \"100% recycled\" in relation to tissue/paper.\n\nType III: ISO 14025\nThese claims give quantitative details of the impact of the product based on its life cycle. Sometimes known as EPDs (Environmental Product Declarations), these labels are based on an independent review of the life cycle of the product. The data supplied by the manufacturing companies are also independently reviewed.\n\nThe most well known example in the paper industry is the Paper Profile. You can tell a Paper Profile meets the Type III requirements when the verifiers logo is included on the document.\n\nAn example of an organization that sets standards is the Forest Stewardship Council.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2026565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026565", "title": "Indianisation (British India)", "text": "Indianisation (British India)\n\nIndianisation of British colonial bureaucracy was an Indianisation process introduced in the later period of British India (early 20th century) whereby Indian officers were promoted to more senior positions in government services, formerly reserved for Europeans. In the Indian police, the rank of Deputy Superintendent was introduced to prepare Indian officers for promotion to higher rank. In the armed forces, the process referred to the replacement of British officers by Indians. The progress was slow and unsatisfactory to the Indian nationalist politicians, however events, mainly the Second World War and the partition and independence which followed it, overtook the programme.\n\nFirst mooted by Sir Henry Lawrence in 1844 as way to retain Indian sepoys (soldiers) in the British-Indian military service, thereby preventing them from peddling their martial expertise to Indian rulers, the Indianisation of the Indian Army's officer corps was seriously discussed by the higher echelons of the Raj as well as by Indian nationalist politicians and activists since the 1880s. The debate revolved around two inter-related questions. First, did Indians have the same aptitude for military command as did Britishers? Second, if it was determined that they did, how would they be integrated into the Indian Army's command structure in a way that did not endanger the continuance of Britain's rule over India? The second question was especially important to the British, as the \"sepoy mutiny\" of 1857-8 was still fresh in their minds. Indeed, some British officers remarked that giving Indians officer training would render them too efficient and therefore dangerous, while others thought the demand was not legitimate because it was advanced by \"false\" urban middle-class Indians, and not by the \"real\" Indians of the rural \"martial races\" who by this time provided most of the Army's manpower and who \"wisely realized\" that the King's Commission was \"properly reserved for the governing [ie British] race.\" Still others thought that the sanctioning of Indian King's Commissioned officers would negatively affect the Indian Army's efficiency. Indian nationalists, however thought that, by not allowing Indians King's Commissions, the British were not honouring the promise in the Queen's Proclamation of 1858 to open employment to Indians in all branches of British-India's government.\n\nIn 1901, Lord Curzon, one of the most controversial British Viceroys of India, sought to solve the vexing Indianisation question once and for all by founding the Imperial Cadet Corps (ICC), which was intended to provide military education and special officer commissions to Indian princes and aristocrats. The ICC failed, for two reasons. First, the special officer commissions awarded to ICC graduates were \"extra-regimental\" and did not bestow the holder with powers of command over anyone - British or Indian. Second, the ICC's purpose was unclear: was it to be a military training institution or a finishing school for a tiny minority of Indian princes? In 1915, the ICC was disbanded.\n\nHad it not been for the advent of the Great War, during which India recruited about 1.3 million men for the British and Allied war effort, and increasing Indian nationalist pressure for tangible rewards for their loyalty, the Indianisation issue might have died. It didn't, and on 20 August 1917, it was announced that Indians were eligible for King's Commissions in the Indian Army. The first 9 Indians awarded King's Commissions were graduates of the ICC. Ten places were now reserved for Indians at Sandhurst.\nThe Sandhurst training directly pitted young Indian men against young Europeans in conditions alien to their upbringing and experience, and not surprisingly the results were unsatisfactory. Of the first batch of 25 cadets admitted to Sandhurst, ten failed t`o meet the requisite standard, two died, two resigned, one was deprived of his commission, and ten passed. To remedy this, on 13 March 1922 the Prince of Wales Royal Indian Military College was established for preparing native Indian cadets for entry to Sandhurst.\n\nIn the meantime, the first measure taken by the British government to \"Indianise\" the army - the Eight Unit Scheme of Indianisation - was announced on 17 February 1923. Indian proposals for faster induction were rejected, and equally unrealistic plans for indianisation over forty years, with restricted kinds of commission, were suggested. Finally, only eight units of the Indian Army were accepted by the British for Indianisation - only five infantry battalions out of 104, two cavalry regiments out of 21, and one pioneer battalion out of seven. They were to be reorganised on the British Army model, with King's Commissioned Indian Officers at every officer level and Indian Warrant Officers replacing Viceroy's Commissioned Officers. The eight units selected were:\n\nOf these eight units, the 2nd Battalion the 1st Madras Pioneers was disbanded in 1933 for economic reasons. However, after ten years another eight units were chosen for Indianisation, one of which was the wartime 8th Battalion the 19th Hyderabad Regiment, today the 4th Battalion, the Kumaon Regiment of the Indian Army.\n\nIndianisation was considered a failure by the Indians, due to the refusal of the British Government to increase the extremely slow rate of induction and the reluctance of the British to accept Indian officers on an equal footing, both professionally and socially. The scheme was suspended at the outbreak of the Second World War, at which point only a handful of military units had been Indianised. The process was never reintroduced, as there was a wartime influx of Emergency Commissioned Officers, posted into all units. In 1947, India became independent, and Indian officers immediately became eligible to fill senior appointments, with accelerated promotion.\n\nIn 19th century Geological Survey of India GSI trained native surveyors, who were called pandit, some notable ones include cousins Nain Singh Rawat and Krishna Singh Rawat. Native surveyors undertook several surveys including Great Trigonometrical Survey, 1869 Kailash-Mansarovar expedition, 1871-1872 Shigache–Lhasa expedition, 1873-1874 Yarkand–Kashgar expedition, second expedition of this area by Sir Thomas Douglas Forsyth, 1878-1882 Darjeeling–Lhasa–Mongolia expedition, etc. \n\n"}

For example, when wet, the color bleeds a watercolor-like layer of tissue paper that stays when the tissue paper is peeled off. Tissue paper can be crumpled up to form objects, such as flowers.\n\nTissue paper was used by musicians in the early 1900s to play the comb, producing a sound similar to the kazoo.

{"id": "2026577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026577", "title": "Snakefly", "text": "Snakefly\n\nSnakeflies are a group of predatory insects comprising the order Raphidioptera with two extant families: Raphidiidae and Inocelliidae, consisting of roughly 260 species. In the past, the group had a much wider distribution than it does now; snakeflies are found in temperate regions worldwide but are absent from the tropics and the southern hemisphere. They are a relict group and have been considered living fossils, as species from the early Jurassic period (140 million years ago) closely resemble modern-day species.\n\nAn adult snakefly resembles a lacewing in appearance but has a notably elongated thorax which, together with the mobile head, gives the group their common name. The body is long and slender and the two pairs of long, membranous wings are prominently veined. Females have a large and sturdy ovipositor which is used to deposit eggs in some concealed location. They are holometabolous insects with a four-stage life cycle consisting of eggs, larvae, pupae and adults. In most species, the larvae develop under the bark of trees. They may take several years before they undergo metamorphosis, requiring a period of chilling before pupation takes place. Both adults and larvae are predators of soft-bodied arthropods.\n\nAdult snakeflies are easily distinguished from similar insects by having an elongated prothorax but not the modified forelegs of the mantis-flies. Most species are between in length. The head is long and flattened, and heavily sclerotinised; it may be broad or taper at the back, but is very mobile. The mouthparts are strong and relatively unspecialised, being modified for biting. The large compound eyes are at the sides of the head. Members of the family Inocelliidae have no simple eyes; members of the Raphidiidae do have such eyes, but are mostly differentiated by elimination, lacking the traits found in inocelliids. The prothorax is notably elongated and mobile, giving the group its common name of snakefly. The three pairs of legs are similar in size and appearance. The two pair of dragonfly-like wings are similar in size, with a primitive venation pattern, a thickened leading edge, and a coloured wingspot, the pterostigma. Inocelliids lack a cross vein in the pterostigma that is present in raphidiids. The females in both families typically have a long ovipositor, which they use to deposit their eggs into crevices or under bark.\n\nSnakeflies are usually found in temperate coniferous forest. They are distributed widely around the globe, the majority of species occurring in Europe and Asia, but also being found in certain regions of Africa, western North America and Central America. In Africa, they are only found in the mountains north of the Sahara Desert. In North America, they are found west of the Rocky Mountains, and range from southwest Canada all the way to the Mexican-Guatemalan Border, which is the farthest south they have been found in the western hemisphere. In the eastern hemisphere, they can be found from Spain to Japan. Many species are found throughout Europe and Asia with the southern edge of their range in northern Thailand and northern India. Snakeflies have a relict distribution, having had a more widespread range and being more diverse in the past; there are more species in Central Asia than anywhere else. In the southern parts of their range, they are largely restricted to higher altitudes, up to around . Even though this insect order is widely distributed, the range of individual species is often very limited and some species are confined to a single mountain group.\n\nSnakeflies are holometabolous insects, having a four-stage life cycle with eggs, larvae, pupae and adults. Before mating, the adults engage in an elaborate courtship ritual, including a grooming behaviour involving legs and antennae. In raphidiids, mating takes place in a \"dragging position\", while in inocelliids, the male adopts a tandem position under the female; copulation may last for up to three hours in some inoceliid species. The eggs are oviposited into suitable locations and hatch in from a few days to about three weeks. \nThe larvae have large heads with projecting mandibles. The head and the first segment of the thorax are sclerotised, but the rest of the body is soft and fleshy. They have three pairs of true legs, but no prolegs. However, they do possess an adhesive organ on the abdomen, which they can use to fasten themselves to vertical surfaces.\n\nThere is no set number of instars the larvae will go through, some species can have as many as ten or eleven. The larval stage usually lasts for two to three years, but in some species can extend for six years. The final larval instar, the prepupal stage, creates a cell in which the insect pupates. The pupa is fully capable of movement, and often leaves its cell for another location before the adult emerges. All snakeflies require a period of cool temperatures (probably around ) to induce pupation. The length of the pupation stage is variable. Most species pupate in the spring or early summer, and take a few days to three weeks before ecdysis. If the larvae begin pupation in the late summer or early fall, they can take up to ten months before the adults emerge. Insects reared at constant temperatures in a laboratory may become \"prothetelous\", developing the compound eyes and wingpads of pupae, but living for years without completing metamorphosis.\n\nAdult snakeflies are territorial and carnivorous organisms. They are diurnal and are important predators of aphids and mites. Pollen has also been found in the guts of these organisms and it is unclear whether they require pollen for part of their lifecycle or if it is a favoured food source. The larvae of many raphidiids live immediately below the bark of trees, although others live around the tree bole, in crevices in rocks, among leaf litter and in detritus. Here they feed on the eggs and larvae of other arthropods such as mites, springtails, spiders, barklice, sternorrhynchids and auchenorrhynchids. The actual diets of the larvae vary according to their habitats, but both larvae and adults are efficient predators. \n\nPredators of snakeflies include birds; in Europe, these are woodland species such as the treecreeper, great spotted woodpecker, wood warbler, nuthatch, and dunnock, as well as generalist insect-eating species such as the collared flycatcher. Typically 5-15% of snakefly larvae are parasitized, mainly by parasitoid wasps, but rates as high as 50% have been observed in some species.\n\nDuring the Mesozoic era (252 to 66 mya), there was a large and diverse fauna of Raphidioptera as exemplified by the abundant fossils that have been found in all parts of the world. This came to an abrupt end at the end of the Cretaceous period, likely as a result of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event (66 mya) when an enormous asteroid is thought to have hit the Earth. This seems to have extinguished all but the most cold-tolerant species of snakefly, resulting in the extinction of the majority of families, including all the tropical and sub-tropical species. The two families of present-day Raphidioptera are thus relict populations of this previously widespread group. They have been considered living fossils, because modern-day species closely resemble species from the early Jurassic period (140 mya). There are about 260 extant species.\n\nSeveral extinct families are known only from fossils dating from the Lower Jurassic to the Miocene, the great majority of them belonging to the suborder Raphidiomorpha. The transitional Middle Jurassic \"Juroraphidiidae\" form a clade with the Raphidiomorpha.\n\nMolecular analysis using mitochondrial RNA and the mitogenome has clarified the group's phylogeny within the Neuropterida, as shown in the cladogram.\n\nThe name Raphidioptera is formed from Greek ῥαφίς (\"raphis\"), meaning needle, and πτερόν (\"pteron\"), meaning wing.\n\nThe Megaloptera, Neuroptera (in the modern sense) and Raphidioptera are very closely related, forming the group Neuropterida. This is either placed at superorder rank, with the Endopterygota – of which they are part – becoming an unranked clade above it, or the Endopterygota are maintained as a superorder, with an unranked Neuropterida being a part of them. Within the endopterygotes, the closest living relatives of Neuropterida are the beetles.\n\nBelow are listed the families of Raphidioptera as grouped according to Engel (2002) with updates according to Bechly and Wolf-Schwenninger (2011) and Ricardo Pérez-de la Fuente \"et al\" (2012). For lists of genera, see the articles on the individual families.\n\nOrder Raphidioptera\n\nSnakeflies have been considered a viable option for biological control of agricultural pests. The main advantage is that they have few predators, and both adults and larvae are predacious. A disadvantage is that snakeflies have a long larval period, so their numbers increase only slowly, and it could take a long time to rid crops of pests; another issue is that they prey on a limited range of pest species. An unidentified North American species was introduced into Australia and New Zealand in the early twentieth century for this purpose, but failed to become established.\n\n"}

During the at-bat, Ruth made a pointing gesture, which existing film confirms, but the exact meaning of his gesture remains ambiguous.\n\nThere is no dispute over the general events of the moment. All the reports say that the Chicago Cubs' \"bench jockeys\" were riding Ruth mercilessly and that Ruth, rather than ignoring them, was \"playing\" with them through words and gestures.\n\nThe longtime debate is over the nature of one of Ruth's gestures. It is unclear if he pointed to the center field, to the pitcher (Charlie Root), or to the Cubs bench. Even the films of the at-bat (by amateur filmmaker Matt Miller Kandle, Sr.) that emerged during the 1990s have not allowed any definitive conclusions.\n\nWith the score tied 4-4 in the fifth inning of game three, he took strike one from Root. As the Cubs players heckled Ruth, and the fans hurled insults, Ruth held up his hand, pointing at either Root, the Cubs dugout, or center field. No one knows for sure what his intentions were. He then repeated this gesture after taking strike two.\n\nRoot's next pitch was a curveball that Ruth hit at least 440 feet to the deepest part of the center-field near the flag pole (some estimates are as high as 490 feet). The ground distance to the center-field corner, somewhat right of straightaway center, was 440 feet. The ball landed a little bit to the right of the 440 corners and farther back, apparently in the temporary seating in Sheffield Avenue behind the permanent interior bleacher seats. Calling the game over the radio, broadcaster Tom Manning shouted, \"The ball is going, going, going, high into the center-field stands...and it is a home run!\" Ruth himself later described the hit as \"past the flagpole\" which stood behind the scoreboard and the 440 corners. Ruth's powerful hit was aided by a strong carrying wind that day.\n\nNewsreel footage (available in MLB's \"100 Years of the World Series\") shows that Ruth was crowding the plate and nearly stepped forward out of the batter's box, inches away from the risk of being called out (Rule 6.06a). The film also shows that as he rounded first base, Ruth looked toward the Cubs dugout and made a waving-off gesture with his left hand; then as he approached third, he made another mocking gesture, a two-armed \"push\" motion, toward the suddenly quiet Cubs bench. Many reports have claimed that Ruth \"thumbed his nose\" at the Cubs dugout, but the existing newsreel footage does not show that. (If it occurred, it might have been considered vulgar and would have been edited out.) Attending the game was Franklin Delano Roosevelt, soon-to-be-elected 32nd President of the United States, as well as John Paul Stevens, future Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. FDR reportedly had a laugh as he watched Ruth round the bases. When he crossed home plate, Ruth could no longer hide his smile, and he was patted by his exuberant teammates when he reached the Yankees dugout.\n\nRoot was left in the game, but for only one pitch, which Lou Gehrig drilled into the right-field seats for his second home run of the day. The Yankees won the game 7–5, and the next day they finished off the demoralized Cubs 13–6, completing the fourth game necessary to win the World Series.\n\nRuth's second home run in game 3 probably would have been merely an exclamation point for the 1932 World Series and for Ruth's career, had it not been for reporter Joe Williams. Williams was a respected but opinionated sports editor for the Scripps-Howard newspapers. In a late edition the same day of the game, Williams wrote this headline that appeared in the \"New York World-Telegram\", evoking billiards terminology: \"RUTH CALLS SHOT AS HE PUTS HOME RUN NO. 2 IN SIDE POCKET.\" Williams' summary of the story included, \"In the fifth, with the Cubs riding him unmercifully from the bench, Ruth pointed to center and punched a screaming liner to a spot where no ball had been hit before.\" Apparently Williams' article was the only one written the day of the game that made a reference to Ruth pointing to center field. The wide circulation of the Scripps-Howard newspapers probably gave the story life, as many read Williams' article and assumed it was accurate. A couple of days later, other stories started to appear stating that Ruth had called his shot, a few even written by reporters who were not at the game.\n\nThe story would have had some initial credibility, given Ruth's many larger-than-life achievements, including past reported incidents of promising sick child Johnny Sylvester that he would \"hit a home run for him\" and then fulfilling that promise soon after. In the public mind, Ruth \"calling his shot\" had precedent.\n\nAt the time, Ruth did not clarify the matter, initially stating that he was merely pointing towards the Cubs dugout to tell them he still had one more strike. At one point very early on, he said, \"It's in the papers, isn't it?\" In another interview, this one with respected Chicago sports reporter John Carmichael, Ruth said he did not point to any particular spot, but that he just wanted to give the ball a good ride. Soon, however, the media-savvy Ruth was going along with the story that he had called his shot, and his subsequent versions over the years became more dramatic. \"In the years to come, Ruth publicly claimed that he did, indeed, point to where he planned to send the pitch.\" One newsreel footage, Ruth voiced over the called shot scene with the remarks, \"Well, I looked out at center field and I pointed. I said, 'I'm gonna hit the next pitched ball right past the flagpole!' Well, the good Lord must have been with me.\" In his 1948 autobiography, Ruth gave another enhanced version by stating he told his wife \"I'll belt one where it hurts them the most\" and that the idea of calling his own shot then came to him. Ruth then recounts the at-bat:\n\nRuth explained he was upset about the Cubs' insults during the series, and was especially upset when someone spat on his wife Claire, and he was determined to fix things. Ruth not only said he deliberately pointed to center with two strikes, he said he pointed to center even before Root's first pitch.\n\nOthers helped perpetuate the story over the years. Tom Meany, who worked for Joe Williams at the time of the called shot, later wrote a popular but often embellished 1947 biography of Ruth. In the book, Meany wrote, \"He pointed to center field. Some say it was merely as a gesture towards Root, others that he was just letting the Cubs bench know that he still had one big one left. Ruth himself has changed his version a couple of times... Whatever the intent of the gesture, the result was, as they say in Hollywood, slightly colossal.\"\n\nDespite the fact that the article he wrote on the day of the game appears to have been the source of the entire legend, over the ensuing years, Joe Williams himself came to doubt the veracity of Ruth calling his shot.\n\nAnother part of folklore has Ruth being mad at the Cubs in general for the perceived slight of cutting Babe's ex-Yankee teammate, Mark Koenig, now with the Cubs, out of his full World Series share.\n\nNonetheless, the called shot further became etched as truth into the minds of thousands of people after the 1948 film \"The Babe Ruth Story\", which starred William Bendix as Ruth. The film took its material from Ruth's autobiography, and hence did not question the veracity of the called shot. Two separate biographical films made in the 1990s also repeated this gesture in an unambiguous way, coupled with Ruth hitting the ball over the famous ivy-covered wall, which did not actually exist at Wrigley Field until five years later.\n\nEyewitness accounts were equally inconclusive and widely varied, with some of the opinions possibly skewed by partisanship.\n\n\nThe called shot particularly irked Root. He had a fine career, winning over 200 games, but he would be forever remembered as the pitcher who gave up the \"called shot\", much to his annoyance. When he was asked to play himself in the 1948 film about Ruth, Root turned it down when he learned that Ruth's pointing to center field would be in the film. Said Root, \"Ruth did not point at the fence before he swung. If he had made a gesture like that, well, anybody who knows me knows that Ruth would have ended up on his ass. The legend didn't get started until later.\" Root's teammate, catcher Gabby Hartnett, also denied that Ruth called the shot. On the other hand, according to baseball historian and author Michael Bryson, it is noted that at that point in the game, Ruth pointed toward the outfield to draw attention to a loose board that was swinging free. Some people may have misinterpreted this as a \"called shot\", but Cubs personnel knew exactly what he was pointing to, and hammered the board back into place.\n\nIn 1942, during the making of \"The Pride of the Yankees\", Babe Herman (who was at that time a teammate of Root with the minor league Hollywood Stars) was on the movie set as a double for both Ruth (who played himself in most scenes) and Gary Cooper (who played Lou Gehrig). Herman re-introduced Root and Ruth on set and the following exchange (later recounted by Herman to baseball historian Donald Honig) took place:\n\nRoot went to his grave vehemently denying that Ruth ever pointed to center field.\n\nIn the 1970s, a 16 mm home movie of the called shot surfaced and some believed it might put an end to the decades-old controversy. The film was shot by an amateur filmmaker named Matt Miller Kandle, Sr. Only family and friends had seen the film until the late 1980s. Two frames from the film were published in the 1988 book, \"Babe Ruth: A Life in Pictures\", by Lawrence S. Ritter and Mark Rucker, on p. 206. The film was broadcast on a February 1994 FOX television program called \"Front Page\". Later in 1994, still images from the film appeared in filmmaker Ken Burns documentary film \"Baseball\".\n\nThe film was taken from the grandstands behind home plate, off to the third base side. One can clearly see Ruth's gesture, although it is hard to determine the angle of his pointing. Some contend Ruth's extended arm is pointing more to the left field direction, toward the Cubs bench, which would be consistent with his (continued) gesturing toward the bench while rounding the bases after the hit. Others who have studied the film closely assert that in addition to the broader gestures, Ruth did make a quick finger point in the direction of Cubs pitcher Charlie Root, or center field just as Root was winding up.\n\nIn 1999, another 16 mm film of the called shot appeared. This one had been shot by inventor Harold Warp, and coincidentally it was the only major league baseball game Warp ever attended. The rights to his footage were sold to ESPN which aired it as part of the network's \"SportsCentury\" program in 2000 as well as a countdown show of Best Damn Sports Show. Warp's film has not been as widely seen by the public as Kandle's film, but those who have seen it and have offered a public opinion on the matter seem to feel that it shows Ruth did not call his shot. The film itself shows the action much more clearly than the Kandle film, showing Ruth visibly shouting something either at Root or at the Cub dugout while pointing.\n\nThe authors of the book \"Yankees Century\" also believe the Warp film proves conclusively that the home run was not at all a \"called shot\". However, Montville's 2006 book, \"The Big Bam\", asserts that neither film answers the question definitively.\n\nShortly after the called shot, the Chicago-based Curtiss Candy Company, makers of the Baby Ruth candy bar, installed a large advertising sign on the rooftop on one of the apartment buildings on Sheffield Avenue. The sign, which read \"Baby Ruth\", was just across the street from where Ruth's home run had landed. Until the 1970s, when the aging sign was taken down, Cubs fans at Wrigley Field had to endure this not-so-subtle reminder of the \"called shot\".\n\nIn the 1948 biographical film \"The Babe Ruth Story\", Ruth delivers on a promise he made to a young cancer patient that he would hit a home run. Not only does Ruth succeed in fulfilling the promise, but the child is subsequently cured of his cancer.\n\nIn an early scene in the film, \"The Natural\", a Ruth-like player called \"the Whammer\" points his bat menacingly toward and past Roy Hobbs, declaring his own \"called shot.\" However, Hobbs strikes the Whammer out on three pitches.\n\nMajor league slugger Jim Thome used a similar bat-pointing gesture as part of his normal preparation for an at-bat.\n\nIn the 1989 film \"Major League\", the climax of the movie depicts Indians catcher Jake Taylor pointing towards the outfield, clearly making a reference to Ruth's called shot. Fittingly, Jake was playing against the New York Yankees. The pitcher then throws a pitch high and inside, referencing Root's suggestion that he would have thrown at Ruth if he had really called his shot. Jake repeats the called shot, but instead of going for a home run, bunts the next pitch for a modified squeeze play, allowing the winning run to come in from second base.\n\nIn the 1992 \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Homer at the Bat\", Homer Simpson, when up for bat at a softball game, points to the stands. When he hits the ball and it goes to the opposite side, he points to that side and pretends that's where he meant to hit it. In the 1999 episode \"Wild Barts Can't Be Broken\", Ruth's \"illegitimate great-grandson\" Babe Ruth IV is a hitter for the Springfield Isotopes. While at bat, he points towards the right field bleachers at Duff Stadium, looking at a \"dying little boy\" (shown to be Bart, who was healthy), then points down to signal a bunt. He is immediately tagged out, as three opposing players were a mere few feet away from him.\n\nIn the 1993 film, \"The Sandlot\", the characters are fans of Ruth and reference his called shot by imitating it.\n\nIn 2000, a novel titled \"Babe & Me\" was published by author Dan Gutman. A young boy travels back in time to prove the shot was called.\n\nIn George Carlin's 2001 book \"Napalm and Silly Putty\", he \"reveals\" that, \"\"Contrary to popular belief, Babe Ruth did not call his famous home run shot. He was actually giving the finger to a hot dog vendor who had cheated him out of twelve cents.\"\"\n\nIn the mid-2000s Bud Light made a commercial of the called shot, humorously depicting Ruth pointing towards center field because he had spotted a vendor selling Bud Light there.\n\nIn 2005, the jersey which Ruth was wearing during the game was sold for at auction.\n\nIn the 2006 computer animated film \"Everyone's Hero\", the shot is instead played by protagonist Yankee Irving using Ruth's famed bat. Yankee hits a home run on Ruth's suggestion. According to the film, the story takes place during the 1932 World Series.\n\nIn the 2006 movie \"The Benchwarmers\", one of the main characters, Richie, points his hand towards center field, resembling Ruth's called shot. Richie's hand then starts dragging down to a spot right in front of home plate. Richie then hits the ball right where his hand points to.\n\nIn the 2007 video game \"Team Fortress 2\", the baseball fanatic Scout, in one of his taunts called the Home Run, points at the sky in the distance and then whacks an opponent with his baseball bat, hitting the player in the direction he pointed, landing an instant kill on anyone caught by it.\n\nAt WrestleMania 35, a vignette of the famous home run was played before John Cena reprised his 'Doctor of Thuganomics' gimmick, interrupting Elias.\n\n\n"}

In 1578, the widow of Francois de Kernevenoy, a Breton whose name was rendered in French as Carnavalet, purchased the building. In 1654, the mansion was bought by Claude Boislève, who commissioned the well-known architect, François Mansart, to make extensive renovations. Madame de Sévigné, famous for her letter-writing, lived in the Hôtel Carnavalet from 1677 until her death in 1696.\n\n\nThe Hôtel Le Peletier de Saint Fargeau was also built in the middle of the 16th century.

Among his siblings were his elder brother Bruno, heir to their father's estates, and Liutgard, who in 876 became Queen of East Francia as consort of the Carolingian king Louis the Younger. The marriage expressed Liudolf's dominant position in the Saxon lands.\n\nAround 873 Otto himself married Hathui (d. 903), probably a member of the noble House of Babenberg (Popponids) and daughter of the Frankish \"princeps militiae\" Henry of Franconia. By her he had two sons, Thankmar and Liudolf, who predeceased him, but his third son Henry the Fowler succeeded him as duke of Saxony and was later elected king. Otto's daughter Oda married the Carolingian King Zwentibold of Lotharingia, son of Emperor Arnulf. His family is called the \"Liudolfinger\" after his father, upon the accession of his grandson Emperor Otto the Great it then was also called the Ottonian dynasty.\n\nBy a charter of King Louis the Younger to Gandersheim Abbey dated 26 January 877, the \"pago Suththuringa\" (region of South Thuringia) is described as \"in comitatu Ottonis\" (in Otto's county). He succeeded his brother Bruno after the latter's death in the Battle of Lüneburg Heath (Ebsdorf) on 2 February 880, fighting against the Viking invaders. \n\nRuling over vast Saxon and Thuringian estates, Otto was mentioned as \"dux\" in later sources, while in a contemporary charter of 28 January 897, Otto is described as \"marchio\" and the \"pago Eichesfelden\" (Eichsfeld) is now found to be within his county (march). He was also the lay abbot of Hersfeld Abbey in 908 and fifty years later was described as \"magni ducis Oddonis\" (great duke Otto) by the chronicler Widukind of Corvey when describing the marriage of his sister Liutgard to King Louis.\n\nDespite his dynastic relations, Otto only had loose connections to the Carolingian court and rarely left Saxony. He remained a regional East Frankish prince and his overlords, Louis the Younger and Emperor Arnulf, with both of whom he was on good terms, rarely interfered in Saxon autonomy. In his lands, Otto was prince in practice and he also established himself as a tributary ruler over the neighbouring Slavic tribes in the east, such as the Daleminzi.\n\nAccording to Widukind of Corvey, the \"Saxon and Franconian people\" offered Otto the kingship of East Francia after the death of the last Carolingian monarch Louis the Child in 911. He did, however, not accept it on account of his advanced age, instead suggesting Duke Conrad of Franconia. The truthfulness of this report is considered doubtful.\n\nThe next year, Otto died at the \"Pfalz\" of Wallhausen. He was buried in the church of Gandersheim Abbey. \n\n"}

Saunas heat the body primarily by conduction and convection from the heated air and by radiation of the heated surfaces in the sauna room. Because of this, infrared therapy is not considered a sauna by Finnish sauna societies. Nevertheless, \"Infrared Sauna\" and \"Infrared Therapy\" are respectively a methodology and a terminology in the application of the infrared electromagnetic field spectrum to the human body. \n\nA 2018 meta-analysis of nine clinical trials found that five weekly sessions of infrared sauna for 2 to 4 weeks, was associated with a significant reduction in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP — a marker of heart failure progression) and cardiothoracic ratio (an indicator of heart enlargement), and improved left‐ventricular ejection fraction, but no significant effect on left‐ventricular end‐diastolic diameter, left atrial diameter, systolic blood pressure, or diastolic blood pressure.\n\nWaon (Japanese: \"soothing warmth\") therapy is a form of IR sauna developed in Japan, used for patients with chronic heart failure and other conditions. Waon therapy has been reported to improve many indicators of heart function, including cardiac output, stroke volume, ejection fraction, while also having benefits in vascular function including decreased vascular resistance and blood pressure. In a 5-year open-label trial, patients receiving Waon therapy in addition to usual care experienced a decrease in cardiac death and rehospitalisation after cardiac events compared to patients receiving usual care alone.\n\nSome infrared therapy proponents claim that the IR is an effective method for considerably raising the rate of energy expenditure in the body. Proponents typically quote the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\" stating: \"A moderately conditioned person can easily sweat off 500 grams in an infrared room, consuming nearly 300 kcal, which is equivalent to running 2–3 miles. A heat-conditioned person can easily sweat off 600–800 kcal with no adverse effects. While the weight of the water loss can be regained by drinking water, the calories consumed will not be.\" However, this conclusion drew significant criticism, at least because it implies that individuals living in warm climates, where liters of sweat are generated per day, would require hundreds or thousands of additional kilocalories to survive, which is known not to be the case.\n\nThere are claims of detoxification which lack scientific evidence.\n\nThe prevalence of serious health claims associated with infrared saunas has prompted some regulatory agencies to issue public safety warnings about the use of these devices. There were fears that patients may refuse conventional medical treatments in favour of infrared sauna therapy.\n"}

The locations of previous G8 summits to have been hosted by the UK include: London (1977, 1984, 1991); and Birmingham (1998). It is the first G8 summit to be held in Scotland. A sixth UK summit was held in Lough Erne in 2013.\n\nThe Group of Seven (G7) was an unofficial forum which brought together the heads of the richest industrialized countries: France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada starting in 1976. The G8, meeting for the first time in 1997, was formed with the addition of Russia. In addition, the President of the European Commission has been formally included in summits since 1981. The summits were not meant to be linked formally with wider international institutions; and in fact, a mild rebellion against the stiff formality of other international meetings was a part of the genesis of cooperation between France's President Giscard d'Estaing and West Germany's Chancellor Helmut Schmidt as they conceived the initial summit of the Group of Six (G6) in 1975.\n\nThe G8 summits during the 21st-century have inspired widespread debates, protests and demonstrations; and the two- or three-day event becomes more than the sum of its parts, elevating the participants, the issues and the venue as focal points for activist pressure.\n\nThe G8 is an unofficial annual forum for the leaders of Canada, the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nThe 31st G8 summit was the last summit for Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin and German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder.\n\nThese summit participants are the current \"core members\" of the international forum:\n\nTraditionally, the host country of the G8 summit sets the agenda for negotiations, which take place primarily amongst multi-national civil servants in the weeks before the summit itself, leading to a joint declaration which all countries can agree to sign.\n\nAs host, the UK stated its intent to focus this G8 meeting on the issues of global climate change and the lack of economic development in Africa. The British government set the priorities of supporting Africa's economic development (by agreeing to write off debts of the poorest countries, and to significantly increase aid) and of moving forward initiatives to research and combat global warming.\n\nPrime Minister Blair had planned to move beyond the Kyoto Protocol by looking at how to include key developing countries (India, China, Mexico, Brazil and South Africa) not included in it - principally by agreeing technology transfer of clean energy technologies in exchange for commitments on reduction of greenhouse gases. Other announced items on the agenda were counter-terrorism, non-proliferation and reform in the Middle East. The summit was overshadowed, however, by bomb attacks in London on the second day of the conference.\n\nThe traditional meeting of G8 finance ministers before the summit took place in London on 10 and 11 June 2005, hosted by Chancellor Gordon Brown. On 11 June, agreement was reached to write off the entire US$40 billion debt owed by 18 Highly Indebted Poor Countries to the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the African Development Fund. The annual saving in debt payments amounts to just over US$1 billion. War on Want estimates that US$45.7 billion would be required for 62 countries to meet the Millennium Development Goals. The ministers stated that twenty more countries, with an additional US$15 billion in debt, would be eligible for debt relief if they met targets on fighting corruption and continue to fulfill structural adjustment conditionalities that eliminate impediments to private investment. The agreement, which required weeks of intense negotiations led by Brown, must be approved by the lending institutions to take effect.\n\nWhile negotiations have essentially taken place between the G8 member states, some of which are reluctant to endorse debt cancellation and aid increases, African governments, advocacy organizations and their allies have criticised the Blair-Brown plan as inadequate and argued that the continuation of structural adjustment policies outweighs the benefits of debt cancellation, while also pointing out that only a small proportion of the Third World debt will be affected by the proposal. In mid-July, objections by Belgium raised the possibility of the debt relief bill not being approved by the International Monetary Fund, a development that was harshly criticized by many activists.\n\nAgreement was not reached on Brown's proposed International Finance Facility, partly because the United States said that its budget procedures meant it was unable to make the necessary long-term funding commitments. The event attracted much media attention.\n\nDevelopment of a joint declaration on efforts to tackle global warming has been much less successful, principally because of the long-standing U.S. opposition to emission targets as a solution to global warming. The other seven G8 nations – France, Russia, Germany, Japan, Italy, Canada and the United Kingdom – have ratified the Kyoto Protocol and have committed to reducing their carbon dioxide emissions by 2010. Hopes had been raised that the unprecedented joint declaration by the G8 countries' academies of sciences on the need for urgent action on global warming would help moderate the US negotiating position.\n\nOn July 6, U.S. President Bush recognised \"that the surface of the Earth is warmer and that an increase in greenhouse gases is contributing to the problem\". However, he said the Kyoto treaty was not the answer. Environment campaigners called the result of the summit \"a very disappointing finale\". \"The G8 have delivered nothing new here and the text conveys no sense of the scale or urgency of the challenge. The action plan, without any targets or timetables, will deliver very little to reduce emissions, or to roll out renewables to the scale required\", said a spokesperson for Friends of the Earth.\n\nThe U.S. also pulled out of financial pledges to fund a network of regional climate centers throughout Africa which were designed to monitor the unfolding impact of global warming. Other schemes opposed by the U.S. include the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) set up to help developing states develop economically while controlling greenhouse gas emissions. \n\nTo address claims that flying so many people around the world to talk about global warming actually contributes substantially to it, the entire G8 Presidency was designed to be carbon neutral, with calculated resulting carbon emissions being offset by purchasing Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs) from a Clean Development Mechanism project. The Kuyasa low-income housing energy upgrade project located in Cape Town, South Africa, was chosen. The first CDM project to be registered in Africa, it involves the installation of solar water heaters, ceiling insulation and low-energy light-bulbs in hundreds of low-income homes in Khayelitsha township.\n\nThe summit was intended as a venue for resolving differences among its members. As a practical matter, the summit was also conceived as an opportunity for its members to give each other mutual encouragement in the face of difficult economic decisions. The United Kingdom aimed to confront the fundamental problem of conflicting domestic pressures among the G8 nations.\n\nAs with all recent G8 summits, the meeting was the focus of many advocacy campaigns, including the Make Poverty History campaign in the United Kingdom, and the anti-globalization (a term not usually used by its supporters) movement. More than 200,000 people marched in support of Make Poverty History in Edinburgh on 2 July, the largest demonstration in Scottish history.\n\nIn addition to the Make Poverty History coalition's efforts, singer/activist Bob Geldof organised concerts in each of the G8 member states on 2 July, as well as a concert in Edinburgh on 6 July. Unlike Live Aid 20 years prior, whose primary aim was to raise money, Live 8 aimed to increase awareness among the citizens of the G8 countries, and thus force their leaders into increasing their focus on world poverty - though in fact Live 8 raised 400 times more than Live Aid simply in terms of the debt deal which the Gleneagles summit delivered; if the deal on aid is honoured it will produce an amount the equivalent of five Live Aid concerts every week. The London concert featured acts ranging from Sting and The Who to Annie Lennox, and most notably the reformation of the classic Pink Floyd line-up.\n\nThousands also mobilized through the G8 Alternatives and Dissent! networks to protest the G8 and discuss alternatives to the economic and political models they represent. These mobilizations have taken a more critical line towards both economic globalization (which they reject entirely) and the G8 itself, which they generally regard as illegitimate and undemocratic.\n\nThe National Library of Scotland holds a collection of leaflets, posters and pamphlets collected during the G8 Summit.\n\nProtest took a variety of forms:\n\n\nOn 19 June details of the security for the summit were leaked to the British newspaper \"The Independent on Sunday\", because of concerns by an intelligence source that ministers were being \"complacent\".\n\nThe security operation, involving more than 10,000 police, many of whom were armed, possibly a number of US Marines, a Special Air Service (SAS) team and snipers, as well as the unprecedented intelligence gathering beforehand by the security service and American intelligence agencies is estimated to have cost around GB£100 million.\n\nPolice officers from all over Great Britain were called in to reinforce the local forces to maintain order in Edinburgh and other cities; even small protests were cordoned off by large numbers of police officers.\n\nThe protest legal support team estimates that at least 700 people were arrested and 350 charged. Targeted actions of London's forward intelligence teams (FITs) resulted in several of the arrests. Most people were released with strict bail conditions, having to leave the districts of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Perth and/or Stirling or even Scotland altogether. Several people were rearrested for breaching their bail conditions. Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which allows searches for weapons in designated areas, was continuously used to stop and search people.\n\nThe G8 summit is an international event which is observed and reported by news media, but the G8's continuing relevance after more than 30 years is somewhat unclear. More than one analyst suggests that a G-8 summit is not the place to flesh out the details of any difficult or controversial policy issue in the context of a three-day event. Rather, the meeting offers an opportunity to bring a range of complex and sometimes inter-related issues. The G8 summit brings leaders together \"not so they can dream up quick fixes, but to talk and think about them together.\"\n\nWhile many activists expressed disappointment that the agreements reached at the summit fell far short of their expectations, others noted that the 2005 summit was perhaps the most productive in the 30-year history of the G8. Some agreements were:\n\nNo agreement was reached to address global warming, largely due to U.S. opposition. The U.S. did agree to a joint communique stating that global warming exists and that human intervention may at least partially be at fault. While the U.S. had previously made such statements, this was the first time it had agreed to a multilateral announcement on the issue.\n\nBreaking with historical practice, the British government had allowed non-governmental organizations to play a key role in deliberations, perhaps prompted by the public pressure of the Make Poverty History movement and Live 8. The summit continued the trend of including the developing world in talks. The leaders of seven African nations attended, as well as the five leading developing countries: China, India, Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa.\n\nThe Infrastructure Consortium for Africa (ICA) was established at the Gleneagles summit in 2005. In subsequent years, the ICA’s annual meeting is traditionally hosted by the country holding the Presidency of the G8.\n\nCloser investigation of many of the promises made at Gleneagles reveals that some of the aid funds were rehashed versions of aid already pledged and the aid was often used to privatise public services to businesses based in the donor country. However even three years on many G8 countries were backsliding on their aid quantity commitments.\n\nThe debt deal was not ‘full’ cancellation of debts at all but only cancellation of the debts for 40 potential countries (classed as the poorest countries), and even then only after completing the ‘Highly Indebted Poor Country’ (HIPC) initiative – that means changing their economic policies at the behest of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank - meaning more of the same economic conditionalities which were highlighted as problems by the Make Poverty History campaign. For example, Tanzania was forced to privatise water (to a British company – Bi-water) which led to a worse service and higher prices. In practice, only 19 developing countries signed up to the HIPC initiative. Even then, only the debt to the public international financial institutions was cancelled (so [Indonesia’s arms debts][www.jubileescotland.org.uk], for example, were not covered). Even then the debts will only apply to a cut off date of 2003. This came despite the fact that the Commission for Africa report noted that in many cases the debt has in practice been paid back many times over, and that the debt was often accrued by illegitimate governments propped up by rich countries. The partial debt cancellation has done some good – Zambia for example is now able to provide universal free healthcare and Tanzania has increased its education spending. However debt campaigners argue that there is still far to go to reach the needed 100 per cent.\n\nAlthough the 2005 G8 communique promised that developing countries should be able to decide their own economic policies, there has been little evidence of this in practice. For example, the EU went on to attempt to push so called 'Economic Partnership Agreements' on developing countries, which Trade Justice campaigners argue will not be good for developing countries, and are being forced upon them against their will.\n\nBecause of the bombings, Blair decided to leave the G8 meeting temporarily to be present in London. He held a brief press conference, saying that the incidents were obviously terrorist attacks directed at the gathering of the G8. He also said that the meeting would continue in his absence, with Foreign Secretary Jack Straw filling in for him. Blair returned to Gleneagles by the evening of the 7th by Chinook helicopter, with heavy military escort. Reports suggest that the bombings may have been planned that day because the terrorists knew that a large number of London police officers would be deployed in Scotland, weakening the city. Thousands of officers were deployed to Scotland from the Metropolitan Police, British Transport Police, and City of London Police, as well as many from other forces.\n\nWhile attending the summit, on 6 July 2005, George W. Bush collided with a British police officer, suffering minor lacerations on his hands and arms; the officer was taken to a local hospital.\n\nIt was initially reported that the officer suffered only minor injuries and was taken to the hospital only as a precaution. However, the officer ended up needing crutches and missing three months of duty. On 26 February 2006, \"The Scotsman\" published a previously unreleased police report which contradicted the administration's story:\n\nBush, who has experienced other bicycle- and Segway-related accidents, commented, \"When you ride hard on a mountain bike, sometimes you fall, otherwise you're not riding hard.\"\n\nThe Gleneagles G8 summit cost the host nation £12.7 million.\n\nFor some, the G8 summit became a profit-generating event; as for example, the official \"G8 Summit\" magazines which have been published under the auspices of the host nations for distribution to all attendees since 1998.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\nActivism\n\nDevelopment\n\nClimate change\n"}

His birthplace was a log cabin his father constructed through the use of wooden pegs. Trowbridge received an unremarkable education, but had an early interest in literature. He recalled in his autobiography that he wrote his first poem at age 13. His first published work was published anonymously in the \"Rochester Republican\" when he was 16.\n\nHe started working as a teacher and on a farm for one year in Illinois. In 1847, at age 19, he moved to New York City to become an author and, with the assistance of Mordecai Manuel Noah, began publishing in periodicals while also working at a pencil case engraving factory. He moved to Boston in August 1848, and in 1850, during the absence of Benjamin Perley Poore in Washington, D.C., edited Poore's paper, the \"Sentinel\", but his editorial on the fugitive-slave law nearly destroyed the paper's popularity. He married Cornelia Warren (May 1, 1834 – March 23, 1864) in 1860. After her death, he remarried to Sarah Adelaide Newton in 1873.\nIn June 1867 Trowbridge bought a house at 152 Pleasant Street, Arlington, Massachusetts where he lived until his death on February 12, 1916. Trowbridge also spent much time in Kennebunkport, Maine, where he built Spouting Rock Cottage, near to \"Spouting Rock\" and \"Blowing Cave\", both of which he named.\n\nHis novels include \"Neighbor Jackwood\" (1857), an antislavery novel; \"The Old Battle-Ground\" (1859); \"Cudjo's Cave\" (1864); \"The Three Scouts\" (1865); \"Lucy Arlyn\" (1866); \"Neighbors' Wives\" (1867); \"Coupon Bonds, and Other Stories\" (1873); and \"Farnell's Folly\". Another is \"Evening At The Farm\".\n\nTrowbridge wrote numerous works under the pseudonym of Paul Creyton, including \"The Midshipman's Revenge\" (1849), \"Kate the Accomplice, or, The Preacher and the Burglar\" (1849), \"The Deserted Family, or, Wanderings of an Outcast\" (1853), \"Father Brighthopes, or, An Old Clergyman's Vacation\" (1853), \"Burr Cliff: its Sunshine and its Clouds\" (1853); \"Martin Merrivale: His X Mark\" (1854), \"Iron Thorpe\" (1855), \"Neighbor Jackwood\" (1857).\n\nAmong his very many juvenile tales are \"The Drummer Boy\", \"The Prize Cup\", \"The Lottery Ticket\", \"The Tide-Mill Stories\", \"The Toby Trafford Series\", \"The Little Master\", and the \"Jack Hazard\" series. His published volumes of verse include: \"The Vagabonds, and Other Poems\"; \"The Emigrant's Story, and Other Poems\"; \"A Home Idyl, and Other Poems\"; \"The Lost Earl\"; and \"The Book of Gold, and Other Poems\". \"The Vagabonds\", \"At Sea\", and \"Midsummer\" are among his best-known poems. His long poem \"Guy Vernon: A Novelette in Verse\" was first published anonymously in the compilation \"A Masque of Poets\" (1878).\n\nIn \"Darius Green and his Flying Machine\", Trowbridge penned the following prophetic verse: \"Darius was clearly of the opinion / That the air is also man's dominion / And that with paddle or fin or pinion, / We soon or late shall navigate / The azure as now we sail the sea.\"\n\nHe is today perhaps best remembered for his study \"The South: A Tour of Its Battlefields and Ruined Cities\" (1867, republished two years later with additions by another author as \"A Picture of the Desolated States and the Work of Reconstruction, 1865-1868\"). Trowbridge toured much of the defeated Confederacy during the summer of 1865 and the following winter. He observed carefully, and talked with a wide variety of people of both sexes, including freedmen, die-hard Rebels, Unionists, farmers, businessmen, refugees, and Northern entrepreneurs. In his book, he lets these people speak in their own voices, often adding his own comments. His book can profitably read with those of John Richard Dennett (\"The South As It Is: 1865-1866\") and Whitelaw Reid (\"After the War: A Tour of the Southern States, 1865-1866\"). All three accounts are written from the perspective of a loyal and fair Northerner genuinely concerned about conditions in the South and the evolving policies of the United States towards that section.\n\nFrom 1865 to 1873 Trowbridge was co-editor with Lucy Larcom of \"Our Young Folks\". Since his death he has been well known as a friend of Mark Twain and Walt Whitman.\n\nTrowbridge's papers are located at Houghton Library at Harvard University.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2026665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026665", "title": "Prognathism", "text": "Prognathism\n\nPrognathism is a positional relationship of the mandible or maxilla to the skeletal base where either of the jaws protrudes beyond a predetermined imaginary line in the coronal plane of the skull. In general dentistry, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and orthodontics, this is assessed clinically or radiographically (cephalometrics). The word \"prognathism\" derives from Greek πρό (\"pro\", meaning \"forward\") and γνάθος (\"gnáthos\", \"jaw\"). One or more types of prognathism can result in the common condition of malocclusion, in which an individual's top teeth and lower teeth do not align properly.\n\nPrognathism in humans can occur due to normal variation among phenotypes. In human populations where prognathism is not the norm, it may be a malformation, the result of injury, a disease state or a hereditary condition.\n\nPrognathism is considered a disorder only if it affects chewing, speech or social function as a byproduct of severely affected aesthetics of the face.\n\nClinical determinants include soft tissue analysis where the clinician assesses nasolabial angle, the relationship of the soft tissue portion of the chin to the nose, and the relationship between the upper and lower lips; also used is dental arch relationship assessment such as Angle's classification.\n\nCephalometric analysis is the most accurate way of determining all types of prognathism, as it includes assessments of skeletal base, occlusal plane angulation, facial height, soft tissue assessment and anterior dental angulation. Various calculations and assessments of the information in a cephalometric radiograph allow the clinician to objectively determine dental and skeletal relationships and determine a treatment plan.\n\nPrognathism should not be confused with micrognathism, although combinations of both are found. It affects the middle third of the face, causing it to jut out, thereby increasing the facial area, similar to the phenotype of archaic hominids and apes. Mandibular prognathism is a protrusion of the mandible, affecting the lower third of the face. Alveolar prognathism is a protrusion of that portion of the maxilla where the teeth are located, in the dental lining of the upper jaw.\n\nPrognathism can also be used to describe ways that the maxillary and mandibular dental arches relate to one another, including malocclusion (where the upper and lower teeth do not align). When there is maxillary or alveolar prognathism which causes an alignment of the maxillary incisors significantly anterior to the lower teeth, the condition is called an overjet. When the reverse is the case, and the lower jaw extends forward beyond the upper, the condition is referred to as retrognathia (reverse overjet).\n\nNot all alveolar prognathism is anomalous, and significant differences can be observed among different ethnic groups.\n\nHarmful habits such as thumb sucking or tongue thrusting can result in or exaggerate an alveolar prognathism, causing teeth to misalign. Functional appliances can be used in growing children to help modify bad habits and neuro-muscular function, with the aim of correcting this condition.\n\nAlveolar prognathism can also easily be corrected with fixed orthodontic therapy. However, relapse is quite common, unless the cause is removed or a long-term retention is used.\n\nIn disease states, maxillary prognathism is associated with Cornelia de Lange syndrome; however, so-called false maxillary prognathism, or more accurately, retrognathism, where there is a lack of growth of the mandible, is by far a more common condition.\n\nPrognathism, if not extremely severe, can be treated in growing patients with orthodontic functional or orthopaedic appliances. In adult patients this condition can be corrected by means of a combined surgical/orthodontic treatment, where most of the time a mandibular advancement is performed. The same can be said for mandibular prognathism.\n\nPathologic mandibular prognathism is a potentially disfiguring genetic disorder where the lower jaw outgrows the upper, resulting in an extended chin and a crossbite. In both humans and animals, it can be the result of inbreeding. In brachycephalic or flat-faced dogs, like shih tzus and boxers, it can lead to issues, such as underbite.\n\nIn humans, it results in a condition sometimes called as \"lantern jaw\", reportedly derived from 15th century horn lanterns, which had concave sides. Traits such as these were often exaggerated by inbreeding, and can be traced within specific families.\n\nAlthough more common than appreciated, the best known historical example is 'Habsburg Jaw', or Habsburg or Austrian Lip, due to its prevalence in members of the House of Habsburg, which can be traced in their portraits. The process of portrait-mapping has provided tools for geneticists and pedigree analysis; most instances are considered polygenic.\n\nAllegedly introduced into the family by a member of the Piast dynasty, it is clearly visible on family tomb sculptures in St. John's Cathedral, Warsaw. A high propensity for politically motivated intermarriage among Habsburgs meant the dynasty was virtually unparalleled in the degree of its inbreeding. Charles II of Spain, 1661 to 1700, is said to have had the most pronounced case of the Habsburg jaw on record.\n\nPrior to the development of modern dentistry, there was no treatment for this condition: those who had it simply endured the condition. Today, the most common treatment for mandibular prognathism is a combination of orthodontics and orthognathic surgery. The orthodontics can involve braces, removal of teeth, or a mouthguard. None of this, however, removes the predisposing genetic condition.\n\nThe surgery required has led, in some cases, to identity crises in patients, whereby the new facial structure has a negative impact mentally on how the patients perceive themselves.\n\nIn entomology, prognathous means that the mouthparts face forwards, being at the front of the head, rather than facing downwards as in some insects.\n\n\n"}

In March 1917 he joined the Bolsheviks as the member of the Kiev Committee, later joining the Kiev revkom as well. He was one of few who initiated the organization of the Congress of the Workers-Peasants and Soldiers deputies as well as the military coup in Kiev. Zatonsky participated in the fight against the Central Rada.\n\nWhen the Red Army took over Kiev in 1918 after the January Uprising, Zatonsky recalled that he only narrowly escaped execution as a counterrevolutionary when only Lenin's mandate saved his life.\n\nAt the beginning of 1918 he was the Head of the Ukrainian delegation from the Ukrainian People's Republic of Soviets for the Brest-Litovsk Peace Conference. From March 19 to April 18, 1918, he was Chairman of the All-Ukrainian Central Executive Committee. In July 1918 he was a commissar of a strike force against the Left Socialist-Revolutionary rebellion in Moscow.\n\nBeginning in November 1918 he was the Narkom of People's Education. While in that post he did everything in his power to shut down the Kamyanets-Podilsky State University as the concentration of the counter-revolutionary forces of Symon Petliura. From 1968 to 1997 the institute was named after Zatonsky. He personally was offered a position by Lenin as a representative of the Soviet Ukrainian People's Republic in the Russian SFSR.\n\nOn November 17–30, 1918, Zatonsky, Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko and Joseph Stalin became members of the Revolutionary Military Council (RMC) of the Special Group of Kursk Troops. The RMC developed a military-strategic plan for the liberation of Ukraine, and began to staff the front with troops. The headquarters of the formation was located in Kursk. From November 30, 1918, Zatonsky was a member of the RMC of the Ukrainian Soviet Army.\n\nIn 1920 he was chairman of Galrevkom. In 1921 he received the Order of the Red Banner for the suppression of the Kronshtadt mutiny. Afterwards he held various government and Party positions in the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic. In 1922 he was one of the persons who signed for the establishment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as the representative of the Ukrainian SSR. In September 1933 Zatonsky was appointed as chief editor of the Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedia.\n\nOn November 3, 1937, he was arrested in a movie theater while he was with his family. Later the authorities conducted an unsanctioned search of his apartment searching for a proof of him being a spy for \"bourgeois\" Poland. After several days his wife was arrested as well. He was charged with being a member of an anti-Soviet Ukrainian nationalist center. On July 29, 1938, he was convicted after a 20-minute-long trial and sentenced to 10 years in prison without right of correspondence. During the Great Purge this was a euphemism for a death sentence, and the same day he was executed by firing squad. In 1956 Zatonsky, along with many others, was posthumously rehabilitated.\n"}
{"id": "2026695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026695", "title": "History of IFK Göteborg", "text": "History of IFK Göteborg\n\nThis article is about the history of the football section of IFK Göteborg. For the history of other sections, see IFK Göteborg (sports club).\n\nThe first IFK association in Gothenburg was founded in 1895, with Oscar Lagerstedt as chairman. It was short-lived, although it has been confirmed that it founded a small-bore rifle shooting challenge prize in the winter of 1896. The next attempt to found an IFK club in Gothenburg was made on 5 September 1897, when two brothers named Friman, Eric Clase and Anton Johansson reconstructed the club. The club was active until at least 1899, but after that no information can be found that confirms the club still existed. During those years, the main activity was athletics, and for a short time in 1899, four-time Olympic gold medalist Eric Flemming was active in the club.\n\nThere was no further activity of any IFK association in Gothenburg between 1900 and 1904. The present-day IFK Göteborg was founded when Arthur \"Lång-Arthur\" Andersson, John Säwström, and two students at Chalmers University of Technology, Arthur Wingren and Sven Ljunggren, wanted to start an IFK club in Gothenburg. The idea came to their minds after reading a news-item which expressed confusion as to why the second largest city in Sweden still did not have an IFK association. Late in the evening of 2 October 1904, it was decided to start the club, and two days later on 4 October, IFK Göteborg became the 39th IFK association. Committees for football, hockey and parties were also founded at the meeting. One of the important initial questions raised was uniform colour. As with almost all IFK clubs, the colors decided on were blue and white. It was also decided that the uniform should consist of blue and white vertically striped jerseys, with blue shorts. The ownership group however lacked the financial resources to buy that kind of striped jersey, so blue ones with a single horizontal white stripe were used instead.\n\nThe first match ever played ended in a 4–1 victory against IK Viking, a club from the local area. The foundation of IFK Göteborg was important for the development of football in the city, as until that point, Örgryte IS (ÖIS), the largest of the area clubs, had dominated the scene. IFK Göteborg represented some needed competition, although ÖIS initially maintained its traditional dominance (up until 1907, IFK only drew once and were outscored by 79–12). IFK also competed in the IFK association competition, but lost to IFK Stockholm in the finals.\n\nÖIS, a dominant and impressive team in Swedish football, outclassed IFK in almost all their meetings the first years. On 13 October 1907, IFK Göteborg, however, became the first Swedish team in a four years long spell to stop their win streak. IFK Göteborg also won the local league in Gothenburg. It is conjectured that this probably lead to the decision by the district board to disqualify IFK Göteborg. However, the Swedish Football Association disagreed with the decision and subsequently revoked it. IFK won the Swedish Championships for the first time in 1908 by winning the cup tournament Svenska Mästerskapet, and three players from the club were selected to play for Sweden in the first game played by the Swedish national team. IFK player Erik Börjesson scored the historic first goal. IFK finished the season by playing against international teams for their first time, the Danish clubs Østerbro BK and Boldklubben af 1893.\n\nIn 1910, the club finished third in the first season of Svenska Serien ever played, although the club was declared Swedish Champions as they won Svenska Mästerskapet. The team played its first game ever using their blue and white striped jerseys. The team played 1–1 in a game in 1912 against what became the Swedish Olympic team, and the newspapers in Stockholm nominated IFK Göteborg as \"the best Swedish football club ever\". The club acted as the national team the next year, where they played Norway to a 1–1 score. This marked both the first and last time that the Swedish national team was represented by only one club.\n\nThe first big scandal in Swedish football occurred in 1914 when several players, leaders, and supporters from IFK and ÖIS started a fight in the 1/8-final of Svenska Mästerskapet. Two years later, in 1916, IFK moved to its new home stadium Gamla Ullevi. Due to the long-standing conflict between the clubs from Gothenburg, Stockholm and the SvFF, the national team between 1913 and 1916 was composed of players from both Stockholm and Gothenburg, but never at the same time. IFK Göteborg won Svenska Serien for the fifth time in a row 1917, but the ongoing war and the Spanish flu led to the dissolution of the competition. As a replacement, a private competition called Fyrkantserien was started in 1918, and IFK also won that competition, which was dissolved the next year.\n\nThe club, with its 875 members started the new decennium by beating both local rivals GAIS and ÖIS in Svenska Mästerskapet, but lost in the semi-finals against Djurgårdens IF. The club gained its first official coach in 1921, Alexander Brody from Hungary. Svenska Serien was played again that year, IFK finishing fifth, but the league was dissolved again in 1924. After another conflict with the SvFF, the three clubs composing the Gothenburg-alliance, IFK, ÖIS and GAIS, boycotted the Swedish Championship tournament, Svenska Mästerskapen, in 1923.\n\nThe first Swedish official national league, Allsvenskan, was started in the autumn of 1924. The same year as the legendary Filip \"Svarte-Filip\" Johansson made his debut for IFK Göteborg. IFK's debut in Allsvenskan was played against Malmö FF and ended in a 1–1 draw. The club finished second, but \"Svare-Filip\" scored 39 goals in 22 games and won the top-scoring league. The next five seasons, IFK never finished worse than fourth, but also never won the league. Swedish football was still dominated by the three big clubs from Gothenburg, IFK, ÖIS and GAIS.\n\nThe 30s started as the 20s ended, with a lot of second and third places, but no win. The 1932–33 season ended with \"Svarte-Filip\" retiring, having reached a total of 177 goals in 181 Allsvenskan games, and totalling 329 goals for IFK. IFK finally won its first Allsvenskan title in the spring of 1935 after eight silver and bronze medals since the league start. As the only Swedish football club, IFK and its players boycotted the 1936 Summer Olympics held in Berlin, Nazi Germany. Swedish football was no longer dominated by teams from Gothenburg in the latter half of the thirties, with both IFK Göteborg and GAIS being relegated in 1937–38, although IFK was promoted back to Allsvenskan the next season. Back in the highest division, IFK finished second as it was decided to finish the league, even after the breakout of World War II.\n\nMobilization affected the clubs as many players were doing their military service. Gunnar Gren (later A.C. Milan) made his debut in IFK as they won the league in 1941–42. The rest of the 40s were a sad time for the supporters of the club and the decade was ended by IFK being relegated from Allsvenskan for the second time. The only light in the dark was Gunnar Gren, being the top scorer in 1946–47 and was together with Gunnar Nordahl playing in a 'Rest of Europe' team against England at Wembley. He was also awarded Guldbollen as the best player in Sweden, and won an Olympic Games gold medal with the Swedish team in 1948.\n\nIFK was promoted to Allsvenskan after one season in Division 2. They barely avoided relegation in 1954–55. The talented Bertil \"Bebben\" Johansson played for IFK and scored 27 goals when they won the long season league played autumn 1957 to autumn 1958. This was done as Sweden changed system from autumn/spring to spring/autumn. IFK competed in a European cup (the European Champion Clubs' Cup) for the first time, being eliminated in the second round. The still unbeaten Allsvenskan record attendance of 52,194 was set when IFK played ÖIS on Nya Ullevi in 1959.\n\nIFK Göteborg gained the nickname \"Änglarna\" (the Angels) when a newspaper seller coined the name after seeing a heavenly freekick being shot by \"Bebben\". The training ground \"Kamratgården\" was built and opened in 1961. One of the founders, John Säwström died in 1962. The 60s were not very kind to the club, with IFK finishing in the middle of the league almost every year, even with \"Bebben\" as coach. The legendary Bengt \"Fölet\" Berndtsson retired in 1967, after setting the record for most matches played for IFK, 598. The team surprisingly won Allsvenskan in 1969.\n\n1970 was the darkest year in the history of IFK. After having won the league the year before, the team was relegated after losing the last game in the series against Örebro SK. 4,000 angry IFK supporters stormed the field in the last few minutes of the game and vandalized the field and the goals, trying to get a re-match. After a big fight between the police and the hooligans, it was decided that the end score should stand. IFK was also eliminated in the first round in the European Cup. After three seasons in the second league, IFK had bought 34 players, but still had not won Division 2 and be promoted back to Allsvenskan. In 1975, still playing in the second league, IFK bought Torbjörn Nilsson and Ove Kindvall. Torbjörn Nilsson showed the way and IFK was promoted to Allsvenskan in 1976. A newspaper arranged a poll, showing that 60% of the people in Gothenburg supported IFK, 25% supported Örgryte IS and 15% GAIS. A new record was set for Swedish Division 2 football when 50,690 persons watched IFK-GAIS at Ullevi.\n\nThe first season in Allsvenskan this decade ended with a sixth place, having bought many good players, including Ralf Edström, Glenn Holm and Tommy Holmgren. In 1978, IFK hired the coach Sven-Göran Eriksson, previously only having minor successes in lower leagues, to make IFK Göteborg a top team once again. He introduced the 4-4-2 system with \"pressure and support\", a system that was going to give IFK great success later on. The 70s ended with a second place in Allsvenskan and the first gold medal in Svenska Cupen.\n\nAfter reinforcing the team with several good players, amongst them Glenn Hysén, Glenn Strömberg and the goalkeeper Thomas Wernerson, IFK finished second in the league and reached the quarter-finals in the UEFA Cup after beating Haka Valkeakoski, Sturm Graz and Rapid Bucureşti. 1982 became a turbulent season, as the whole board was replaced, and the club almost going bankrupt, having to loan money from the supporter club to be able to go to Valencia and play the quarter-final in the UEFA Cup. After the troublesome start, IFK won everything they could win that year, including Allsvenskan, Svenska Cupen, and the UEFA Cup, after beating Valencia and Kaiserslautern on the way, and defeating Hamburger SV in the finals.\n\nAfter the European success, many players went abroad trying their luck, which meant that the team was split. IFK still fielded a strong team and won gold in both the league in 1983 and 1984 and the cup in 1983. IFK also played in the European Cup and reached the quarter-finals two years in a row. In 1986, the team advanced even further, but was eliminated in the semi-finals after 3–0 at home and 0–3 away and then being defeated after penalties against FC Barcelona. A new team of talents made the impossible and won both the UEFA Cup and Allsvenskan once again in 1987, after beating Dundee United in the finals. The later years of the 80s showed an old team that would need a few young, hungry players. After finishing seventh in the league, the new junior coach Roger Gustafsson took over the team.\n\nGustafsson could not have gotten a worse start than 0–6 against IFK Norrköping in the premiere of Allsvenskan in 1990. He using many youth players, and got heavily criticized by the press. However, in the next game, a 5–0 victory against AIK showed them that Gustafsson was doing the right thing. After a good autumn, IFK once again won Allsvenskan. It was also decided to move back to the old arena Gamla Ullevi, originally built for IFK in 1916. IFK won the league and the cup in 1991, and Gustafsson became a hero. 1992 ended with a fifth place in Allsvenskan, but a good result in the UEFA Champions League, beating PSV Eindhoven twice and FC Porto once, finishing second in their group after A.C. Milan.\n\nIFK won Allsvenskan in 1993, their 14th title (Swedish record), and once again qualified for international play. IFK advanced to the group stage of the Champions League by beating Sparta Prague. The group consisted of FC Barcelona, Manchester United and Galatasaray. No one really believed that IFK would survive the group and enter the quarter-final stage, but after beating Galatasaray twice, and Manchester United and Barcelona once, plus one loss and one draw, IFK Göteborg won the group and was now playing Bayern Munich.\n\nThe 1995 season started with the quarter-finals against Bayern Munich, which ended in two draws, 0–0 in Munich and 2–2 at home, but IFK was eliminated due to fewer away goals. IFK won the league for the third time in a row, but was eliminated in the first round of the Champions League by Legia Warszawa, and the fantastic career of Roger Gustafsson ended. IFK hooligans behaved badly in the qualification to the Champions League, and IFK was punished by having to play next home match at least 250 kilometers from Gothenburg.\n\nAlthough Gustafsson left, IFK continued to play well with the new coach Mats Jingblad, and won Allsvenskan 1996 for the fourth time in a row, and thus qualified for the Champions League once again. IFK won against A.C. Milan 2–1 at home, but lost all the five other games in the group. The last years before the new millennium was a disaster, with \"only\" a silver in 1997 and at eighth place in 1998, after buying several expensive players without success. Jingblad was fired during the season and was replaced with Reine Almkvist. Almkvist was not able to make IFK to a winning team and was fired during the 1999 season when the club was situated in the lower part of the table. IFK had changed coach in the middle of a season two years in a row, something that the club never before had done. His replacement Stefan Lundin was more successful and the last year of the decade ended with a sixth place.\n\nThe first year of the new millennium started well for IFK. The club bought the players Gustaf Andersson, Tomas Rosenqvist and Mikael Sandklef from local rival Västra Frölunda IF. The player made success and IFK was in the top of Allsvenskan at the summer but when player Stefan Landberg was injured and had to end his career the club lost the contact with the very top and ended at fourth place. After strengthening the team with national team defense player Pontus Kåmark and promising Martin Ericsson the team was one of the favourites for the 2001 season. IFK again started very good but when national team midfielder Håkan Mild was injured the team played lost a couple of important games. Mild did a comeback at the end of the season and IFK approached the top position. But after losing two of the three last games the team once again finished at fourth place and was qualified for the UEFA cup.\n\nThe 2002 season was a disaster for IFK. Håkan Mild left the team for Wimbledon FC and IFK did not look like a favourite for the title for the first time of many years. IFK was located in the middle of the table during the summer but then problems appeared. Pontus Kåmark was injured and had to retire. Economical problems made the team sell striker Gustaf Andersson to Helsingborgs IF. The team fell to the bottom of the table and was almost relegated, staying in Allsvenskan only after two nervous playoff games against Västra Frölunda IF (1-1, 2-0). The result in the UEFA Cup was a humiliating defeat against a Moldavian club, Zimbru. Stefan Lundin was fired during the autumn and temporarily replaced by Roger Gustafsson. 2003 was slightly better. Håkan Mild was brought back from Wimbledon FC and Bo Johansson became new coach. IFK played very unstably, wins against many of the top teams while a lot of lost and draw games against the other teams. IFK ended on a seventh place.\n\nFor the 2004 season, IFK looked very strong with the new players Niclas Alexandersson and Peter Ijeh. The team were involved in the gold fight but finished at third place. In the Swedish cup, the team made it to the final but lost against Djurgårdens IF with 3–1. With the new striker Stefan Selakovic IFK made it to the final in the first edition of the Scandinavian championship Royal League and the team again looked like a favourite for Allsvenskan 2005 with new coach Arne Erlandsen. But because of avoiding tax for the transfer of players Ijeh and Selakovic, the director Mats Persson was sentenced to jail. The club had a lot of bad attention from the media and striker Ijeh was sold to FC Copenhagen. Despite this, the club made a good season and finished at second place. Håkan Mild quit his career as a football player and became the new director. The team again looked strong for the 2006 but after selling the defense players Karl Svensson to Rangers and Oscar Wendt to FC Copenhagen the team collapsed at the end of the series and finished at 8th place. Erlansen was fired.\n\nFew people believed that IFK could challenge for the title of the 2007 season since the squad mostly consisted of young, unknown players. But the club had a perfect mix of promising players and old experienced players. Defense player Ragnar Sigurdsson and striker Marcus Berg had a breakthrough and the team won the title for the first time in 11 years. The team also made it to the final of the Swedish cup where they lost against Kalmar FF with 3–0. Berg scored 14 goals and was sold to Groningen at the end of the season while midfielder Tobias Hysén was bought from premier league club Sunderland FC.\n\n2008 started well for IFK when the club wan the Swedish supercup after a 3–1 win over Kalmar FF. But in allsvenskan the team had some problems with the offense during the spring and lost contact with the leading team Kalmar FF. But after the club started playing with the young forward Robin Söder the team started playing well. IFK made a good effort in the qualification to Champions League but lost to FC Basel with 1-1 (home) and 2-4 (away). The loss was a big disappointment but the season ended better after winning the Swedish cup against a victory over Kalmar FF after penalties. IFK ended at 3rd place in allsvenskan.\n\nDuring the 2009 season IFK Göteborg played at the new renovated stadium Gamla Ullevi and in the opening game the club beat Djurgården with 6–0. The club made very strong result during the spring and was at the top of the allsvenskan before the summer break. During the summer the club had a lot of injuries and a lost a lot of points in the league. Internationally the club were defeated by Hapoel Tel Aviv in the qualification for UEFA Europa League. The club bought players Tuomo Turunen, Hannes Stiller and Theodor Elmar Bjarnason and won a lot of games during the autumn. In the last game IFK was only one point behind AIK who was the leader of allsvenkan but after a lost with 1–2 to AIK in the last game the club ended at second position of the league. In the Swedish cup IFK made it to the final but lost once again to AIK.\n\nBefore the 2010 season IFK bought the striker Pär Ericsson from local rivals GAIS. The club was one of the favourites to win the title but the series started with bad results and lots of injuries. IFK did very bad results during the spring when the club only won 3 matches and was just above the relegation places in the league. After the summer break the club played better but ended at 7th place after a very weak ending. During the summer Kim Christensen was sold to FC Copenhagen and Gustav Svensson was sold to Turkish champions Bursaspor. In the qualification for UEFA Europa League the club did two good matches against AZ Alkmaar but was eliminated with 1–2 in total (0-2, 1-0).\n\nDespite the bad results from 2010 the team kept the coach Jonas Olsson for the 2011 season. IFK did not make any big changes in the squad but bought the striker Andreas Drugge from Trelleborgs FF and Hjörtur Logi Valgarðsson from Icelandic club Fimleikafélag Hafnarfjarðar. The season started terrible with 4 losses in the 4 first games. The team started winning in the late spring and summer but after losing tight games against the top teams IF Elfsborg (2-3) and Helsingborgs IF (1-2) it was clear that IFK was not going to end up in the top-4 in allsvenskan. The team finished weak and ended up in 7th place. IFK made it to the semifinal of the Swedish cup but was eliminated by Kalmar FF (3-4).\nDuring the summer players Philip Haglund and Emil Salomonsson was transferred to the club while defender Ragnar Sigurdsson was sold to FC Copenhagen and midfielder Sebastian Eriksson was sold to Cagliari Calcio.\n\nAfter the disappointing 2011 season coach Jonas Olsson left the club. IFK made a controversial choice for the new coach, Mikael Stahre who coached main rivals AIK during the 2009 season. The club bought several high-profile players, goalkeeper John Alvbåge returned from Örebro SK, Brazilian midfielder Daniel Sobralense was bought from Kalmar FF, Norway national team defender Kjetil Waehler was bought from AB Aarhus, midfielder Pontus Farnerud was bought from Stabaek and midfielder Nordin Gerzic was bought from Örebro SK. The club did a good pre-season with victories over Rosenborg and Lilleström and draw against Russian team FC Spartak Moscow. IFK was favourites to win allsvenskan 2012 and was nicknamed \"Real Blåvitt\" (Real Bluewhite) by the media.\nAllsvenskan started disastrously though with losses against Syrianska FC and IFK Norrköping and only draw against Örebro despite dominating the matches. The team seemed to recover and took 3 straight victories but then started to lose points again. The defence did not work well and several potential victories was lost by late equalisers. After the humiliating 0–5 away against Gefle IF the team was just a few points above the relegation limit. Old defender Mattias Bjärsmyr returned to the club and the team started to win again. With only one loss in ten games, the club secured a new contract for the 2013 season. IFK ended again up in a 7th place.\nDuring the summer midfielder Tobias Sana was sold to AFC Ajax.\n\n\n\n\n"}

KCIOs were introduced in the early 20th century under the Indianisation process. They were equivalent in every way to the British officers holding a King's commission (known in India as King's commissioned officers, or KCOs). They held the same ranks, and unlike VCOs had authority over British troops. In fact, most KCIOs served on attachment to a British unit for a year or two early in their careers.\n\nIt was announced in 1918 that the King's Commission would be opened to Indians for whom ten places would be reserved in the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, UK, to be trained as officers of the Indian Army. The first cadets from both Sandhurst and another defence college, Daly College in Indore, India, were given the King's Commission. There was great disquiet amongst the British, who disliked the idea of serving under native officers; others felt that without good breeding, a public school education, and sufficient suitable training, Indians would not become good officers and would neither be able to lead nor be accepted by the native troops. There was a firm belief among British officers and the home government that only the British educational system could provide the right kind of officer, and that it could do it only from suitable stock.\n\nThe Sandhurst training directly pitted young Indian men against young Europeans in conditions alien to their upbringing and experience, and not surprisingly the results were unsatisfactory. Of the first batch of 25 cadets admitted to Sandhurst, ten failed to meet the requisite standard, two died, two resigned, one was deprived of his commission, and ten passed. To remedy this, on 13 March 1922 the Prince of Wales Royal Indian Military College was established for preparing native Indian cadets for entry to Sandhurst.\n\nIn the meantime, the first measure taken by the British government to \"Indianise\" the army - the Eight Unit Scheme of Indianisation - was announced on 17 February 1923. Indian proposals for faster induction were rejected, and equally unrealistic plans for indianisation over forty years, with restricted kinds of commission, were suggested. Finally, only eight units of the Indian Army were accepted by the British for Indianisation - only five infantry battalions out of 104, two cavalry regiments out of 21, and one pioneer battalion out of seven. They were to be reorganised on the British Army model, with King's Commissioned Indian Officers at every officer level and Indian Warrant Officers replacing Viceroy's Commissioned Officers.\n\nThe eight units selected were:\n\nThe first batch of KCIOs included: Commander-in-Chief Tripura Forces Col. Rana Jodha Jung Bahadur, Amar Singh, Maj. Gen. Ajit Rudra, K.A.D Naoroji (grandson of Dadabhai Naoroji), Field Marshal K.M. Cariappa and C.B. Ponnappa. Many officers who later held high rank in the post-independence Indian Army and Pakistan Army began their careers as KCIOs. Maj. Gen. Dinkarrao Appasaheb Surve, Field Marshal K.M. Cariappa, Hanmantrao Mohite, Gen. K.S. Thimayya, Lt. Gen. S.P.P. Thorat, Jai Singh, Maj. Gen. Harkirat Singh, Lt. Gen. Moti Sagar, Lt. Gen. B.M. Kaul, Maj. Gen. Ishfakul Majid and Field Marshal Ayub Khan were a few of the Sandhurst-trained officers. The last of the KCIOs in Indian Army Service was General P.P. Kumaramangalam, who retired in 1969.\n"}

Leśnica (now part of Wrocław), 7 or 8 December 1201) was Duke of Wroclaw from 1163 until his death in 1201.\n\nHe was the eldest son of Władysław II the Exile by his wife Agnes of Babenberg, daughter of Margrave Leopold III of Austria and half-sister of King Conrad III of Germany. Bolesław spent his childhood in the court of his grandfather and namesake, Bolesław III Wrymouth, in Płock. It was not until 1138, after the death of Bolesław III, that he moved with his parents to Kraków, which became the capital of the Seniorate Province, ruled by his father as high duke and overlord of Poland.\n\nThe reign of Władysław II was short and extremely stormy. The conflicts began when the high duke tried to remove his half-brothers, the junior dukes, from their districts. According to the chronicler Wincenty Kadłubek, the confrontation between the siblings was mainly instigated by Władysław II's wife, Agnes of Babenberg, who believed that her husband, as the eldest son, was the rightful sole ruler of the whole country. On the other hand, Salomea of Berg, widow of Bolesław III and Władysław II's stepmother, attempted to form alliances with foreign rulers and took every opportunity to secure the reign of her sons, the junior dukes. She feared that they would be relegated from their positions to make way for Władysław II's sons, the young Bolesław and his brothers Mieszko Tanglefoot and Konrad.\n\nThe conflict erupted in 1141, when Salomea of Berg, without the knowledge of the high duke, decided to leave the land of Łęczyca, her dower, to her sons and tried to give her youngest daughter, Agnes, in marriage to one of the sons of Grand Prince Vsevolod II Olgovich of Kiev. Władysław II was faster, however, and he gave Grand Prince Vsevolod II several additional political advantages, including a marriage between Bolesław and Vsevolod II's daughter, Zvenislava, which took place in 1142.\n\nThe Polish-Ruthenian alliance soon proved to be extremely important in the struggle between Władysław II and the Junior Dukes. The final conflicts took place after the death of Salomea of Berg in 1144. It seemed that a victory for the High Duke - thanks to his military predominance - was just a matter of time. In fact, Władysław II was so confident of winning at home that he sent Bolesław to aid Grand Prince Vsevolod II during a revolt in Kiev.\n\nUnfortunately, Bolesław's expedition ended in complete disaster, as the Grand Prince's death from disease created general confusion in Kiev. Then in 1146, Bolesław had to return quickly to Poland to help his father. The few troops which he recruited were not enough to stop the general rebellion against Władysław II, who was completely defeated by the Junior Dukes. The deposed High Duke and his family initially escaped to the Prague court of Duke Vladislav II of Bohemia.\n\nAfter a short time in Bohemia, Władysław II and his family moved to Germany, where his brother-in-law, King Conrad III, offered his hospitality and assistance toward the high duke's restoration. At first, it seemed that the exile would just be for a few months, thanks to the family connections of Duchess Agnes; however, their hurried and insufficiently prepared expedition failed to cross the Oder River, and ultimately failed because of strong opposition from Władysław II's former subjects and problems Conrad III had within Germany as a result of his extended travels. The king gave Władysław II and his family the town of Altenburg in Saxony. This was intended as a temporary residence, but Władysław II would spend the rest of his life there.\n\nTired of a tedious life in Altenburg, Bolesław traveled to the court of his protector, King Conrad III. With him, the young Polish prince extensively took part in German political affairs. In 1148 he joined in the Second Crusade with Conrad III, during which he visited Constantinople and the Holy Land. Conrad III died in 1152 without having secured the return of Władysław II to Poland. His successor was his energetic nephew Frederick Barbarossa, whose service Bolesław almost immediately joined. The first action of the new German ruler, however, was not to help Władysław II, but instead to march against Rome and be crowned emperor. Bolesław accompanied him.\n\nIt was not until 1157 that the emperor finally organized an expedition against Poland. It is unknown whether Bolesław, his brothers, or his father directly participated in the expedition. However, despite the military victory and the humiliating submission of High Duke Bolesław IV the Curly to Frederick Barbarossa, the emperor decided to maintain the rule of Bolesław IV and the junior dukes in Poland, and not to restore Władysław II to the throne. Two years later, on 30 May 1159, the disappointed former high duke died in his exile in Altenburg.\n\nDespite his dissatisfaction at the emperor's treatment of his father, Bolesław remained at the side of the emperor, participating in his many wars. From 1158-1162 he took part in the Barbarossa's expedition to Italy, where he won fame after killing a well-known Italian knight in a duel on the walls of Milan.\n\nBolesław's faithful service to the emperor was finally rewarded in 1163, when Barbarossa succeeded through diplomacy in restoring to the descendants of Władysław II their inheritance over Silesia. By an agreement signed in Nuremberg, Germany, Bolesław IV agreed to accept the return of the exiled princes. He did so because, after the death of Władysław II, his sons could not directly challenge his authority as the senior duke, and they had not yet established any support within Poland. In addition, seating them would satisfy \nBarbarossa and thus keep him away from Poland. However Bolesław IV decided to maintain the security of his lands and retain the control over the main Silesian cities of Wroclaw, Opole, Racibórz, Głogów, and Legnica.\n\nAfter almost 16 years of exile, Bolesław returned to Silesia with his second wife, Christina (Zvenislava had died around 1155); his elder children, Jarosław and Olga; and his younger brother Mieszko Tanglefoot. The youngest brother, Konrad, remained in Germany.\n\nBolesław and Mieszko initially ruled jointly and two years later (1165) both retook the major Silesian cities handed back by the high duke and obtained full control over all Silesia. However Bolesław, as the eldest brother, held overall authority. Three years after taking control over Silesia, Bolesław felt strong enough to lead a retaliatory expedition against High Duke Bolesław IV to try and recover supremacy over Poland.\n\nBolesław's exercise of overall power at the expense of his younger brother caused a revolt by Mieszko Tanglefoot in 1172. In a major disturbance in the Silesian ducal family, Mieszko supported Jarosław, the eldest son of Bolesław, who was resentful against his father because had been forced to become a priest due to the intrigues of his stepmother Christina, who wished for her sons to be the only heirs. The rebellion was a complete surprise to Bolesław, who was forced to escape to Erfurt, Germany. This time, Frederick Barbarossa decided to support Bolesław with a strong armed intervention to restore him to his Duchy. Eventually Mieszko III the Old was sent by the high duke to calm the fury of the emperor and keep him away from Polish affairs. Mieszko III gave Barbarossa 8000 pieces of silver and promised him the restoration of Bolesław, who finally returned home at the beginning of 1173. However, despite his reconciliation with his brother and son, he was forced to divide Silesia and create the duchies of Racibórz (granted to Mieszko) and Opole (to Jarosław).\n\nFour years later, it seemed that Bolesław was close to achieving the main objective of his life, the recovery of the Seniorate Province, and with this the title of high duke. He conspired with his uncle Casimir II the Just and his cousin Odon (Mieszko III's eldest son) to deprive Mieszko III the Old of the government. The coup gained the support of Lesser Poland, which was mastered by Casimir and shortly afterwards Greater Poland sided with Odon. Bolesław, however, suffered a sudden and surprising defeat at the hands of his brother Mieszko and his son Jarosław who had allied with Mieszko III. This left the way free for Casimir II to be proclaimed High Duke, and Bolesław again had to escape to Germany. Thanks to the mediation of Casimir II, Bolesław returned to his Duchy without major troubles in 1177; however, he suffered a further diminution of his authority when he was compelled to give Głogów to his youngest brother Konrad.\n\nAfter this defeat, Bolesław retired from the Polish political scene and concentrated his efforts on the rule over his duchy. His brother Konrad's death without issue in 1190 resulted in the return of Głogów to his domains.\n\nDuring the last years of his reign, Bolesław devoted himself to economic and business activity. Colonization, initially from poor German areas, substantially accelerated the economic development of the duchy, and was continued by his son Henry I the Bearded. Bolesław founded the Cistercian Abbatia Lubensis abbey in Lubiąż with the collaboration of monks from Pforta, across the Saale River in Thuringia. Later the abbey became the Silesian ducal burial place.\n\nTo safeguard his lands from other Piast princes, Bolesław obtained a protective bull from Pope Innocent III in 1198. There was a reconciliation between Bolesław and his eldest son, Jarosław, who was elected bishop of Wrocław. This enabled him, after Jarosław's death on 22 March 1201, to inherit Opole, which was again reunited with his lands.\n\nBolesław survived his son by only nine months, however, and died on 7 or 8 December 1201 in his , west of Wrocław. He was buried in the Lubiąż Cistercian monastery which he had founded.\n\nIn 1142 Bolesław married his first wife Zvenislava (d. ca. 1155), daughter of Grand Prince Vsevolod II Olgovich of Kiev. They had two children:\n\nBy 1157, Bolesław married his second wife Christina (d. 21 February 1204/1208), a German; according to the historian Kazimierz Jasiński, she was probably a member of the comital house of Everstein, Homburg, or Pappenheim. They had seven children:\n\nIn German and Polish historiography there exists a controversy about the relations between Silesia and the Holy Roman Empire in the early medieval period. According to some German historians the date of 1163, when Bolesław and his brothers were allowed to return to Silesia, is considered to be the moment when Silesia separated from Poland and became part of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nOn the other hand, Polish historians claim that Władysław II the Exile's sons, who were allowed to return by High Duke Bolesław IV the Curly, were simply typical Piast dukes who ruled in the divided Kingdom of Poland.

{"id": "2026728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026728", "title": "The Stony Brook School", "text": "The Stony Brook School\n\nThe Stony Brook School is a 7–12 private, Christian, co-educational, college-preparatory boarding and day school in Stony Brook, New York, United States. It was established in 1922 by John Fleming Carson and fellow members of the Stony Brook Assembly. Its founding headmaster was Frank E. Gaebelein.\n\nIn 1906, a group of Presbyterian ministers and laymen began an enterprise to form an annual series of summer Bible conferences in the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. These conferences were to be in the tradition of other Bible conferences already established at Chautauqua, New York, Winona Lake, Indiana, and Northfield, Massachusetts.\nThe group was led by the Rev. John Fleming Carson, pastor of the former Central Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn and later Moderator of the Presbyterian General Assembly (1911). After having visited the hamlet of Stony Brook in 1907, Carson and his associates settled on a location directly across from the train station. The first summer conference of the Stony Brook Assembly began on July 3, 1909 and was a success. The Stony Brook Assembly was formally incorporated by the state of New York in 1914.\nCarson's vision also included the establishment of a boys' school which could use the Assembly grounds outside of the summer months. As early as 1916, formal plans were being considered for opening the school, but financial constraints and World War I postponed the opening of the school until the fall of 1922. On September 13, The Stony Brook School was inaugurated with 27 boys and 9 faculty. Founding headmaster Frank E. Gaebelein called the new school an \"experiment\" in Christian education and set the mission for the school as being a rigorous college preparatory school thoroughly rooted in the Christian tradition. Education was not merely an emphasis on strong academics for the education of the mind, but more importantly was an emphasis on building character for the education of the heart - a distinction he linked with an adherence to the gospel. In his report to the Board in November 1937, Gaebelein reaffirmed the purpose of the school stating, “It was never the aim of Dr. Carson and the other founders, however, simply to inaugurate one more college preparatory school. Stony Brook’s prime reason for existence has been to bring its [students] into vital contact with the Christian faith.”\n\nThe academic reputation of the school grew in prominence. In May 1923, it was granted a charter by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York. In 1928, the school was accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.\nIn 1930, SBS was granted a charter by the Cum Laude Society, placing it among the first sixty schools granted this distinction since 1906.\nIn 1931, the Director of Admissions at Princeton University indicated that the admissions committee was so impressed with the caliber of Bible study at Stony Brook that it would award one Carnegie Unit of preparation for college.\n\nIn the fall of 1971, a group of thirty day-student girls entered the school, beginning the school's move toward co-education. The following year, female boarding commenced.\n\nIn honor of the school's fiftieth anniversary in 1972, long-time faculty member and writer D. Bruce Lockerbie penned a history of the school entitled, \"The Way They Should Go.\"\n\n\nAcademic rigor combined with an integration of the Christian faith are central to the school's academic tradition. Some of the hallmarks of the core curriculum include freshman Critical Reading and Reasoning, the freshman and sophomore Humanities curriculum, junior Bible-English, and the senior Bible capstone course Faith and Culture in the 21st Century. The graduation requirements mirror a traditional liberal arts education composed of 4 years of English and History, 3 years of one Foreign Language, Science, and Mathematics, and 1 quarter credit in the visual arts.\n\nThe school offers twenty-one Advanced Placement (AP) courses as well as numerous full-year elective courses in such subjects as the Engineering, Innovation, and Design (STEM), History of Philosophy, Ethics and Politics, Advanced Digital Imaging, and 20th Century Fiction and Creative Writing. Students also have opportunities to take mini-courses interspersed throughout the year in a wide range of electives as well as conduct various internships and research opportunities off-campus at nearby institutions such as Stony Brook University, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nTeaching students to write well is one of the hallmarks of the school's curriculum. In the Upper School, students are instructed across disciplines in the art of the analytical and personal essay, with special emphasis placed on the organization and craft of a well-written argument.\n\n\n\n\n\"Note: AP Latin alternates biennially with College Level Latin.\"\n\nStony Brook was one of the original members of the Ivy Preparatory School League, composed of prep schools around the New York City and Long Island area. In 1974, the school joined Section XI of the New York State Public High School Athletic Association. In at least two out of the three seasons, students must participate in an athletics team or an approved alternative extracurricular activity. Approved activities include interscholastic Chess, Robotics, and the Theater Arts Society, all of which are offered in winter.\n\nInterscholastic Sports\nFall\n\nWinter\n\nSpring\n\nThe mascot of the school is the Bear. During the 1970s and most of the 1980s the mascot was the Shrike.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe school owns twenty-four faculty homes, which line the perimeter of the campus. These homes include:\n\n\n\n"}

Things were a challenge at first, Aiko have trouble accepting the fact her mother is going to die soon. Eri at first invited Aiko to stay with her at Ippukan, but Aiko only ran back home; Eri decided something more drastic and take her to stay with her Okinawan family.\n\nWhile in Okinawa, the Kohagura family took turns looking after her, showing Aiko the delights of life in Okinawa. Eri's older half-brother, Keisho, invented yet another variant of his beloved creation, Goya (bitter melon) Man, with the Goya Man Game (another likely product failure).

Both ladies were so happy to meet again and Tsujiuchi was especially happy to see Aiko changed for the better; Tsujiuchi was deeply touched when she saw her daughter perform a traditional Okinawan dance.\n\nInspired by recent events, Mariya used the story of Aiko as the basis for her new novel. Although a well-written story, the book didn't catch the attention she had hoped; she was proud to have it published nonetheless. With the help of good friends, Keitatsu was taught the meaning of rock is justice and what he's doing isn't cool at all. The explanation made him realize he needs to be with Shouko and he ran back home. Shouko was in labor and Keitatsu made it home shortly after the birth of their son.

In prose the team was commonly called \"the Athletics\", plural, and later generations have usually called both club and team the \"Philadelphia Athletics\".\n\nThe Athletics turned professional in the late 1860s and helped establish the first league, National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NA), which began play in 1871. Their home field had been at 15th and Columbia, an otherwise unnamed venue informally called \"the Athletic grounds.\" For 1871 they relocated to Jefferson Street Grounds, playing most of their home games there until being expelled from the major leagues after the 1876 season.\n\nThe Athletics were one of the most successful National Association teams, winning the first pennant with a record of 21 wins and 7 losses (.750), two games ahead of the Boston Red Stockings and Chicago White Stockings. Actually, the race was much closer: the primary official criterion then was neither games nor winning percentage, but wins, and the three clubs finished in the order given with 21, 20, and 19 victories. The final game of the season, played on October 30 in Brooklyn, saw Athletic defeat Chicago, 4–1, clinching the title. Chicago had become a road team following the Great Chicago Fire. (Nate Berkenstock, a 40-year-old amateur who played right field for Philadelphia that day due to injuries, made his only big-league appearance in that game.)\n\nWhile Boston dominated the NA, winning the other four pennants, the Athletics and New York Mutuals also fielded teams every year, with Philadelphia winning a few more games overall but never challenging Boston.\n\nDick McBride served as regular pitcher for more than a decade and as captain throughout the NA seasons, which gives him manager credit today. Other star players include Al Reach in the 1860s and Cap Anson who played from 1872 to 1875 (Anson took over as captain near the very end of the 1875 season).\n\nThe Athletics also played one game in Dover, Delaware on June 24, 1875. They played at Fairview Park Fair Grounds.\n\nDuring their five-year existence the Athletics won 165 games and lost only 86 for a winning percentage of .657. Notable players on their roster included Hall of Famer Cap Anson, infielder Ezra Sutton, and pitcher/manager Dick McBride.\n\nDuring the summer of 1875, the Chicago White Stockings moved decisively to improve its team by recruiting six stars then playing in Boston and Philadelphia. Four Red Stockings players (catcher Deacon White, infielders Cal McVey and Ross Barnes, and pitcher Al Spalding) and Philadelphia Athletics third baseman Cap Anson would play for Chicago in 1876, with Ezra Sutton remaining in Philadelphia for the Athletics' final season.\n\nChicago's William Hulbert, assisted by player Albert Spalding and sportswriter Lewis Meacham, moved at the same time to organize a new league. Hulbert recruited first the St. Louis Brown Stockings of the National Association, independent clubs from Louisville and Cincinnati (the Louisville Grays and Cincinnati Reds), and four eastern clubs: the Athletics, the New York Mutuals, the Hartford Dark Blues, and the Boston Red Stockings. Three NA clubs still in business were excluded: the Philadelphia Whites, Brooklyn Atlantics, and the New Haven Elm Citys. The Athletics and Mutuals were selected rather than the Whites and Atlantics, as the new National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs granted exclusive territories to all member clubs. New Haven was too small a city and the club had declined to travel west in 1875, playing only three home games apiece with Chicago and St. Louis. On Saturday, April 22, 1876, the Athletics played in the first game in the history of Major League Baseball, losing to the Boston Red Caps, 6–5.\n\nAfter having spent 15 years as a strong and stable club, the Athletics fared poorly in the new National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs, finishing seventh with 14 wins in 60 games, 38 wins behind Chicago. Near the end of the season, the financially troubled team refused to make a western road trip, finishing with 35 games played at home and 25 away.\nMutual of New York also refused, owing the western teams nine home games. Both clubs were expelled from the National League, which simply contracted from eight to six for the 1877 season.\n\nThe 1876 Athletics were managed by Al Wright and played their home games at the Jefferson Street Grounds. Their top-hitting regular was left fielder George Hall, who batted .366 with a slugging percentage of .545. Another strong batter on the team was third baseman Levi Meyerle, who hit .340. The best pitcher on the team was Lon Knight, who won 10 games, lost 22, and had an ERA of 2.62.\n\nChampionship matches with professional teams (1869–1870) and with professional leagues (1871–1876)\n\nSource for season records: Wright (2000) has published records for dozens of NABBP teams each season, relying on a mix of game and season records in contemporary newspapers and guides. Dozens of leading clubs by number of matches are included, as are many others. The records do not consistently cover either all games played or all championship matches between NABBP members.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2026780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026780", "title": "Snack Foods Limited", "text": "Snack Foods Limited\n\nSnack Foods Limited is an Australian snack food company and was officially formed on 25 November 1999, and was owned by Arnott's Biscuits Holdings Pty Ltd., a subsidiary of the American Campbell Soup Company. Snack Foods Limited owns one of Australia's largest salted snack food companies, Snack Brands Australia. In April 2008, Campbell Arnott's sold Arnott’s Snackfoods to The Real McCoy Snackfood Co and the company is now known as Snack Brands Australia.\n\nSnack Foods Limited was formerly known as Dollar Sweets Holding Limited until it changed its name on 25 November 1999. Campbell announced its intent to acquire Snack Foods Limited on 4 June 2002, and offered A$2.00 per share, acquiring over 90% of the company. Under Australian corporate law, once a company acquires 90% of a public company, it is entitled to acquire the remaining outstanding shares regardless of whether they are tendered into the offer. The total takeover cost approximately $255 million and each shareholder received a dividend of 2.5 cents per share from Snack Foods Limited.\n\nSnack Foods Limited had approximately $125 million (USD) in sales in 2001, and has constantly grown 8% annually since.\n\nWith Arnott's acquisition of Snack Foods Limited it became Australia’s second largest producer of Australian salty snack foods after the long established British Australian company The Smith's Snackfood Company.\n\nIn 1985 there was a landmark Supreme Court case involving Dollar Sweets. The case represented a rare occasion in which a common law verdict was used to resolve an industrial dispute despite the existence of specialist industrial courts.\n\nIn early 1985 award negotiations broke down between the Victorian branch of Dollar Sweets and the Confectionery Workers Union, over the issue of a 36-hour working week and a requirement that workers sign a no-strike agreement. A number of workers were sacked during negotiations, and the Union immediately set up a picket line. The picket line remained for 143 days, with the company refusing to reinstate the workers and seeking common law damages against the union. A number of bomb and arson threats were made against Dollar Sweets and one strike-breaking driver was assaulted and his truck vandalised.\n\nDollar Sweets was represented in the Victorian Supreme Court by Melbourne barrister Peter Costello and the case was financed by the Victorian Chamber of Commerce. The company alleged union interference with contractual relations, intimidation, nuisance, and a conspiracy to injure the plaintiff and sought an injunction and punitive damages. The ACTU also publicly condemned the strike action, saying the CWU’s 36-hour claim was \"outside the Accord\".\n\nIn December 1985 Victorian Supreme Court Justice Peter Murphy gave judgement, describing the picketing as \"stupid and nihilistic.\" He ruled that this was not a \"lawful form of picketing, but a... nuisance involving obstruction, harassment, and besetting\". It was beside the point that there were specialist courts for industrial disputes. \"This court is not without power ... and should intervene\". He issued an interlocutory injunction against the picket, and ordered the union to pay $175,000 in damages.\n"}
{"id": "2026802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026802", "title": "Midnighter", "text": "Midnighter\n\nMidnighter is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books first published by WildStorm and later DC Comics once it absorbed the former. The character was created by writer Warren Ellis and artist Bryan Hitch. The character made his first appearance in \"Stormwatch\" (vol. 2) #4, titled \"A Finer World (Part 1 of 3)\" (February 1998). He went on to appear in various \"Authority\" books and other series, as well as his own eponymous ongoing series.\n\nMidnighter is best known as a member of the rogue superhero team the Authority. He and his husband, Apollo, have also been interpreted as a parallel of the Batman/Superman World's Finest partnership. Unlike Batman, Midnighter has certain enhanced abilities and generally kills his opponents.\n\nIn an interview for \"Comic Values Annual\" (1999), edited by Alex G. Malloy, Warren Ellis described Midnighter as \"The Shadow by way of John Woo\". Midnighter is rarely seen without his costume and mask. Recurring themes in Midnighter's adventures are his love of violence and killing, as well as comments on his sexuality.\n\nIn 2016, writer Steve Orlando and artist Fernando Blanco created a six-issue limited series, \"Midnighter and Apollo\", that focused on the character's relationship with his husband. Orlando told \"The Advocate\" that \"I would say I feel pressure to showcase a realistic relationship, and that means neither an unattainable, idealized vision or an overly dysfunctional one. Real relationships are work, and I want to treat Midnighter and Apollo with the same respect, passion, and intricacy we all deal with in our own relationships on a daily basis.\"\n\nWarren Ellis created and introduced the character in 1998, soon after his appointment as writer on the \"Stormwatch\" title. \"Stormwatch\" vol. 2 #4 introduced Midnighter and Apollo as former Stormwatch agents from a secret \"black ops\" team known only to the first Weatherman, Henry Bendix. In the first issue of the arc, collected in trade paperback as A Finer World, Christine Trelane had cracked the files of the recently deposed Bendix and discovered Apollo and Midnighter's existence. The new Weatherman, Jackson King, intercepted them on a mission to seize weapons made in the \"Nevada Garden\", a bioengineering facility created by the first Engineer. Flashback sequences showed Midnighter and Apollo, the sole survivors of their seven-member team's sinister first mission, escaping Bendix and going rogue to spend five years fighting crime on the streets of America. Midnighter and Apollo initially resisted their capture, believing Stormwatch still to be under Bendix's command; on learning of his death, they ended their opposition and accepted a mission from King to destroy the Nevada Garden. To repay their assistance, Trelane granted Midnighter and Apollo new civilian identities and lives away from Stormwatch. This story arc introduced Midnighter's trademark enhancements, his superpowered healing and ability to anticipate an opponent's moves so quickly as to win any fight, as being the product of bioengineering commissioned by Bendix.\n\nIn 1999 Warren Ellis concluded his run on \"Stormwatch\" with the Final Orbit storyline, which saw the team destroyed. Midnighter was one of several Stormwatch characters Ellis retained for his new Wildstorm title, \"The Authority\". In it, Midnighter (along with Apollo) was recruited by Jenny Sparks for a new team, the Authority, under her leadership. The new series picked up themes Ellis had explored in \"Stormwatch\", including the political potential of a team more powerful than world governments and the United Nations.\n\nA formidable fighter with a sardonic attitude, Midnighter epitomised the new team's commitment to fighting for a finer world, including against vested interests and world governments. Midnighter and Apollo's relationship, though hinted in previous issues, was revealed in \"The Authority\" #8. Midnighter was the architect of the team's first significant victory, the defeat of autocratic dictator Kaizen Gamorra, which he achieved by dropping the 50-mile-long Carrier onto Gamorra's island base.\n\nDuring the \"Transfer of Power\" storyline, Midnighter was the only Authority member to evade capture when the U.S. government had the team attacked and replaced with manipulable substitutes. Presumed dead, Midnighter had in fact escaped the Carrier with baby Jenny Quantum. He returned to overthrow the puppet team and rescue Apollo from imprisonment and abuse at the hands of their replacements. Shortly thereafter Midnighter and Apollo were married and adopted Jenny.\n\nMidnighter had a central role in Ed Brubaker and Dustin Nguyen's \"Revolution\" maxiseries. A visitation, apparently from a future Apollo, convinced Midnighter that he was on the path to becoming a malign dictator. To avoid this fate, Midnighter quit the team, precipitating its break-up, and returned to life fighting solo on the streets. Raised alone by Apollo, Jenny exploited her powers to age herself to young adulthood and reformed the Authority. Having convinced Midnighter to rejoin the team, Jenny discovered he was being manipulated by a dimension-hopping Henry Bendix, hitherto assumed dead. Midnighter fought for Bendix before the Engineer was able to break the mind-control; Midnighter then killed Bendix by ripping out his spine.\n\nMidnighter featured in the first three of Garth Ennis's \"Kev\" miniseries, featuring Kev Hawkins, a former SAS soldier. Kev was introduced in the semi-parody \"The Authority: Kev\", in which he killed Midnighter, Apollo and the rest of the Authority, though the Carrier resurrected them. On their last meeting they took down MI5's Royal Oak project, an attempt to replicate Bendix's experiments. Kev later featured without the Authority in the final book of his series, \"A Man Called Kev\".\n\nOn 1 November 2006, an ongoing \"Midnighter\" solo series began, with an initial creative partnership of Garth Ennis and Chris Sprouse. The book was part of the 2006 \"Worldstorm\" soft reboot of the Wildstorm universe, which saw several books relaunched, but which faltered when flagship titles \"The Authority\" and \"WildC.A.T.S.\" suffered serious delays and were cancelled after two and one issues respectively. The series was originally intended as a six-issue miniseries but ran for 20 issues and was cancelled in June 2008.\n\nThe first story arc saw Midnighter attacked and kidnapped by agents of a man named Paulus while passing through the Carrier's teleportation portal. Paulus told Midnighter that he had replaced Midnighter's secondary heart with a remote-detonated bomb, and challenged him on pain of death to assassinate Adolf Hitler.\nTime-travelling back to the First World War trenches, Midnighter encountered Hitler as a young corporal in the German army, but was apprehended by 'time police' officers from the 95th century before carrying out his mission. In his struggle to escape, he crashed the officers' time machine at the year 1945, shortly before Hitler's expected suicide. Eventually Midnighter allied himself with the police and returned to his own time, where he threatened to erase Paulus from history by killing his kidnapped younger self; he secured Paulus's surrender without having to kill the child. Midnighter then returned to the Carrier, but was apparently just as listless as before, immediately sending himself on another mission in Iraq.\n\nThis first arc was followed by four single-issue stories. \"Midnighter\" #6 featured an apparent alternate-universe Samurai Midnighter. \"Midnighter\" #7, by Brian K. Vaughan and Darick Robertson, explored the way Midnighter's brain processes combat by running the story backwards. \"Midnighter\" #8, by Christos Gage and John Paul Leon, dealt with Midnighter's attempts to connect better with humans after a graphic and public battle with the \"Suicide King\".\n\nA second story arc (issues #10–16), under new creative team Keith Giffen and Jon Landry (with ChrisCross pencilling later issues), detailed Midnighter's attempts to rediscover his life before becoming superhuman. Files given to him by Jenny Quantum identified him as Lucas Trent, born 14 July 1967 (making him 40 years old in 2007), a native of Harmony, Indiana. On visiting the town he found it was the hub of a paramilitary patriotic organisation named Anthem, with ambitions to take over the United States and provide the country with the conscience they felt it had lost. While battling Anthem and its superpowered operatives, including Dawn (a reference to the phrase \"dawn's early light\" in \"The Star-Spangled Banner\"), and Rosie (patterned after Rosie the Riveter), he discovered that Jenny had falsified the documents she gave him, and that he had never been Trent – but decided to stay on in Harmony nonetheless.\n\nThe final storyline, again by Giffen, featured a Midnighter imposter attacking the Carrier and the Authority, and Midnighter's, fight to defeat him.\n\nThe 2007 mini-series, \"Grifter & Midnighter\", united Grifter, of WildC.A.T.s, with Midnighter. The series was written by Chuck Dixon, with art by Ryan Benjamin and inking by Saleem Crawford.\n\nThe 2008 \"Number of the Beast\" Wildstorm limited series described the devastation of Earth, and set the scene for a new Authority ongoing series, by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning, part of the \"World's End\" storyline. In this series Midnighter appears as one of the last Authority members still able to act in the ruins of London, now called Unlondon. Separated from Apollo, who is confined to the upper atmosphere by sunlight-blocking fog over the planet's surface, Midnighter helps civilians to reach the ruins of the Carrier, now a stronghold for survivors. Midnighter is able to contact Apollo via balloons which he releases high up in the atmosphere.\n\nFollowing the resolution of the \"World's End\" storyline, the Authority's Carrier is called back to its creators. Jack Hawksmoor, Swift, and the Engineer go with it, but Midnighter remains on Earth to be with Apollo, who needs to be close to the sun.\n\nIn the autumn of 2011, DC relaunched its production with 52 new titles, including \"Stormwatch\" (written by Paul Cornell and drawn by Miguel Sepulveda). Cornell's \"Stormwatch\" #1 debuted a radically new version of the team, which lasted until spring 2013. Featuring longtime DC character Martian Manhunter and a number of new creations, Stormwatch was posited as a modern-day version of DC's Demon Knights, and Midnighter and Apollo were introduced at the start of their careers, unaware of one another's sexualities and their mutual attraction to one another. The first issue depicts the group's attempt at recruiting Midnighter and Apollo. Lucas Trent was presented for the first time as Midnighter's actual name and his costume was redesigned drastically. When Harry Tanner (who at the time was disguised as one of the Shadow Lords) framed Midnighter, he escaped, taking the Projectionist along with him. Eventually, when the team managed to capture him, Harry's ruse was revealed and Midnighter's innocence was proven. After the Engineer, who had been slowly losing her humanity, attacked them, Midnighter managed to escape with Apollo and with the help of his ally Zealot, attacked the base. After Jenny destroyed the base and killed the Engineer, the team mostly disassembled and Midnighter and Apollo realized that they had feelings for one another. For Jim Starlin's run on the title with issue #19, a time travel incident returned Midnighter and Apollo to their original designs and status as long-time lovers, before the \"New 52\"'s status quo for the characters was restored in the final issue.\n\nDuring the summer of 2014 he is regularly featured in the comic book series \"Grayson\" as he works to stop Spyral in collecting the body parts of a dead villain which endows those who have them the powers of the Justice League.\n\nThe character began appearing in his own ongoing DC Comics series in June 2015, written by Steve Orlando. In it, Midnighter, having broken up with Apollo, has to come to terms with being newly single, as well as tracking down a thief who stole exotic technology from the God Garden and is openly selling it to different individuals. Amongst the items stolen are files containing the origin of who Midnighter really was before the Gardener abducted and created him. After teaming up with Spyral agent Dick Grayson to track down Russian vampire thrill-killers, Midnighter accompanies his new boyfriend to the latter's hometown to track down those who attacked his father and encounters the mastermind behind the theft of the God Garden technology-Prometheus.\n\nThe character appears again along with his former boyfriend, Apollo for a six-issue miniseries titled \"Midnighter and Apollo\", continuing in the \"New 52\" canon, where the two of them have gotten back together as a couple. Apollo is attacked and his soul trapped in a hell dimension, and Midnighter plans to rescue him. He learns by Extraño where Apollo is trapped. He then goes in search of the Ace of Winchesters, killing a demon called Vodyanar to get one bullet and then going into Hell to take the Ace from the Lords of the Gun.\n\nMidnighter is also referenced in the newly renumbered \"Detective Comics\" as a Batman Family ally; it is mentioned that Nightwing reaches out to him to access Door technology. This implies that they have maintained their professional friendship from \"Grayson\" and the \"DCYou\" \"Midnighter\" series.\n\nMidnighter's abilities are presented in the character's first appearance, occurring in \"Stormwatch\" (vol. 2 #4). Midnighter is the product of bioengineered enhancements commissioned by the character of Henry Bendix. It is implied (as in the \"Midnighter\" solo series (issues #10–16)) that Midnighter was a normal human before enlisting with Stormwatch Black. Several storylines have featured the deactivation, over-riding, or removal of the character's enhancements to reduce Midnighter's abilities to those of a normal man. The abortive \"Team Achilles\" series suggested that Bendix had \"designed\" Midnighter and Apollo during his childhood.\n\nTypically, Midnighter is presented with superhuman strength, speed, reflexes and resilience. The character is shown moving faster than both the human and superhuman eye, and in possession of a healing factor that allows him to rapidly recover from injury and illness. Storylines have shown Midnighter surviving a broken neck, broken limbs, holes through his chest and burning; the character is also portrayed clearing \"AIDS in six weeks\". Midnighter is capable of surviving in anaerobic environments for short time periods and possesses a secondary replacement heart. He also has the power to suppress pain so he can keep fighting when pain would stop a normal person.\n\nMany writers have referenced Midnighter's trademark ability to predict the unfolding of a battle before it starts. Early in Ellis's run on \"The Authority\", the character was described as having a mental combat computer, with neural-inductive implants, which he uses to run through a given combat situation millions of times in his mind, almost instantly covering nearly every possible result before the first punch is even thrown. This allows for the perfect response and counterattack, such that if Midnighter can possibly win a battle, he will. Ellis portrayed the Midnighter delivering a monologue on this ability to intimidate opponents; Keith Giffen later had the character distribute a business card to this effect, to save time. Howard Link of Stormwatch describes such an ingenious ability design as Neurotactical Wetware. Issue #7 of the \"Midnighter\" solo series, written by Brian K. Vaughan, showed the character using this ability regressively, to visualize the desired outcome of a battle and work backwards logically to achieve it. The stand-alone \"Authority\" graphic novel \"Human on the Inside\", by John Ridley, suggested the ability was reactive, and required an opponent to make a first move to define the possibilities for a response. Though this is contradicted by numerous earlier, and later comics. Midnighter was also unable to use this ability against the Joker due to the latter's extreme insanity, implying that Midnighter's ability to predict attacks in opponents with unpredictable nature are useless.\n\nIn \"The New 52\", Midnighter's ability are slightly different. His power to predict the outcome of any situation still exists, but appears to have been supplemented by a form of precognition as well as enhanced knowledge. He is able to finish other people's sentences before they have thought about it, and when Stormwatch's map of alien threats to Earth materialised in front of him and Apollo, he instantly knew what it was. He has significant resistance to telepathic attacks, as he was able to resist the Scourge of Worlds' attempt to use the Martian Manhunter's telepathy on him. He mentions that he has carbon-fibre muscles that presumably enhance his strength. Harry Tanner, reputed to be the world's greatest swordsman, struggled to land even a single blow on Midnighter since the latter could predict every move he would make. After a few seconds of fighting, Midnighter immediately knew what Harry's power was. He has demonstrated the ability to move so stealthily that the Manhunter and Hawksmoor could not hear or sense his stalking them until it was too late. His suit enhances his durability; he was able to survive unaided in hyperspace for a while.\n\n\nIn 2013, ComicsAlliance ranked Midnighter as #17 on their list of the \"50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics\". In 2015, IGN listed Midnighter (along with Apollo) on their list of \"18 Awesome LGBT Characters\".\n\n\n\"Midnighter\" solo series:\n\n\nOther collections:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its flagship store is located on Henry Street, on the north side of central Dublin.\n\nThe store has its origins in a business founded in 1843 at 14 Henry Street, by George Cannock and Andrew White. In 1845, two bankers, Andrew and Patrick Reid, became partners in the business. In 1848, White died, and the entrepreneur John Arnott took shares in the company. In 1865, Cannock departed the business, and the business was renamed as Arnott's.\n\nThe main shop occupies much of the block behind the GPO to the west of O'Connell Street, between Henry Street and Abbey Street, covering an area of some 300,000 square feet. The original store was completely destroyed in a fire on , and a new building was constructed in the following year. It was registered as a private company on . The main entrance is on the pedestrianised Henry Street. Across O'Connell Street in North Earl Street was Arnotts sister store, Boyers & Co, which closed down on 31 January 2016.\n\nA footwear-only branch of Arnotts was located in the Stillorgan Shopping Centre until 2011, with a former branch on Grafton Street initially changed to be branded as a River Island, before being sold in 2003.\n\nBefore the 2010 takeover, Arnotts was privately owned by a consortium, Nesbitt Acquisitions, comprising about 50 members of the Nesbitt family, led by Richard Nesbitt. The original owners retain one per cent of the business. In July 2010, Arnotts was taken over by Anglo Irish Bank and Ulster Bank, due to large outstanding loans on its failed \"Northern Quarter\" property development. On , the store was taken over by Selfridges, a chain of department stores, and now trades as a sister store to Brown Thomas which is part of the same group.\n\nThe newsreader Aengus Mac Grianna used to work in the Sports Department.\n\nArnotts were one of the longest standing sponsors of GAA until 2009, when their 18-year partnership as sponsors of Dublin GAA came to an end.\n\nIn 2006, Nesbitt Acquisitions announced their plans to redevelop their properties located between O'Connell Street and Liffey Street, incorporating the former Independent Newspapers building on Abbey Street. The new development was to be called the Northern Quarter and was to be one of the largest rejuvenation projects to ever be undertaken in this area of the city centre. The estimated cost of the project was €750,000,000. Following planning difficulties and the financial crisis in Ireland, the project never went ahead. Arnotts incurred large debts in acquiring property, leading to their takeover by financial institutions in 2010.\n\nAs part of this project, it was intended to move the department store to a nearby former Debenhams Ireland branch in the Jervis Shopping Centre, but as plans changed this opened as \"Arnotts Project\" ; which operated for less than a year before being surrendered back to the landlord.\n\n"}
{"id": "2026808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026808", "title": "Naval Tactical Data System", "text": "Naval Tactical Data System\n\nNaval Tactical Data System, commonly known as NTDS, refers to a computerized information processing system developed by the United States Navy in the 1950s and first deployed in the early 1960s for use in combat ships. It took reports from multiple sensors on different ships and collated it to produce a single unified map of the battlespace. This information could then be relayed back to the ships and to the weapons operators.\n\nWarships have compartments known as Combat Information Centers, or CICs, that collect, sort and then communicate all of the battlefield information known to that ship. Information about targets would be forwarded to the CIC by the operators of the radar and sonar systems, where crewmen would use this information to update a shared map. Commanders used the map to direct weapons to particular targets. The system was similar to the Battle of Britain Bunker system, but on a smaller scale.\n\nThere were two major problems with this system. One was that each ship had its own view of the battlespace, independent of the rest of the ships in the task force. This led to force allocation problems - the ship with the right weapon for a particular target might not see that target on their sensors, or two ships might attempt to attack the same target while ignoring another. This could be addressed by adding inter-ship radio or flag signals as another input to the map, but the workload of moving so many bits of data was enormous. This led to the second major problem, the high inherent manpower requirements and lack of shipboard space.\n\nDuring World War II and the immediate post-war era, major navies started studying these problems in depth, as concerns about coordinated attacks by long-range high-speed aircraft became a serious threat. To give the task force enough reaction time to deal with these threats, \"pickets\" were posted at a distance from the force to allow their radars to pick up the targets while still on the approach. The information from these ships then had to be relayed, normally by voice, to the other ships in the force. Some experiments with video cameras pointed at the radar displays were tried, but were subject to transmission loss when the ships pitched on the swells and the high-bandwidth antennas no longer pointed at each other.\n\nWhat was ultimately desired was a system that could collect target information from any sensor in the fleet, use that to build a single shared picture of the battlespace, and then distribute that data accurately and automatically to all of the ships. As the data was now being collected almost entirely from electronic devices and displays, a system that picked up this data directly from those displays would be ideal.\n\nDevised to be used in conjunction with the Type 984 radar, the first such system was developed by the Royal Navy in the immediate post-war era using analog systems that tracked the rate of motion of \"blips\" on radar screens. The operators used a joystick to align a pointer with the target and then pushed a button to update the location. The circuitry then adjusted the rate of predicted movement of the blip and displayed a pointer that moved over time. Updating no longer required any inputs, unless the predicted motion began to differ at which point additional button pushes could be used to update it. The data for each of these tracks, a series of voltages, could then be transmitted around the ship, and later, inter-ship transmission using pulse-code modulation. Ralph Benjamin found that decoding the position of the joystick was not ideal and desired a system that read out relative motion instead of absolute position, and invented the trackball as a solution. The Type 984 radar and Comprehensive Display System (CDS) were fitted to the aircraft carriers , and \n\nThis work suffered from the reliability of the analog circuits used to run the system. By the early 1950s the digital computer appeared to offer a solution, not only by greatly increasing reliability through the removal of any moving parts, but also by directly working with the digital data that made up the plots. Data from one computer simply needed to be copied directly to another, there was no need to code and decode analog signals representing those values. The Royal Canadian Navy began work on such a system under their DATAR project, which included the first working example of the trackball concept. Unfortunately their design used tubes, and the resulting machine was so large it took up almost all of the free space on the it was installed on. Efforts to build a transistorized version of the DATAR did not receive funding and the project ended.\n\nThe work by the RN and RCN teams was well known to the USN starting as early as 1946, and included live demonstrations of the Canadian system on Lake Ontario. They also built their own version of the Royal Navy's concept as the \"Electronic Data System\", and 20 sets were eventually produced by Motorola. In 1953 they produced a new system for air direction known as the \"Intercept Tracking and Control Console\" which could track two incoming and two outgoing (interceptor) formations. However, the system was huge and did not include inter-ship transmission, so was only used on a small number of aircraft carriers.\n\nHowever, all of these solutions had problems that limited their usefulness. Analog systems were difficult to keep operational and subject to errors when maintenance was less than perfect. The Canadian version, using digital computers, was better, but needed to be transistorized. The US Air Force was also involved in their own Project Charles, a similar system but on a much larger scale. Their system also used vacuum tubes and would end up being the largest computers ever built, each occupying of floor space, weighing , and consuming 1.5 megawatts of electrical power. The Navy kept a watchful eye on these developments and others under Project Cosmos.\n\nDevelopment of computers in the mid-1950s led both by the Navy's long interest in code-breaking computers, the introduction of newer types of transistors, and the widespread introduction of core memory, reached a point where a Navy version of Air Force's SAGE air defense network was a practical possibility. The Navy began development of the NTDS system using a transistorized digital computer in 1956. With NTDS and wireless data links, ships could share the information gathered by their sensors with other ships in a task force. NTDS was the inspiration for the Aegis system now in use on Navy ships.\n\nA variety of UNIVAC embedded computers, including the first fielded version of the late 1950s, the CP-642A (AN/USQ-20), typically with 30 bit words, 32K words of magnetic core or thin film memory, 16 parallel I/O channels (also 30 bits wide) connected to radars and other peripherals, and a RISC-like instruction set, were used. Logic circuits used discrete transistors and other elements soldered to a printed circuit board with connectors running along one side. Each card was coated in a varnish-like substance to prevent exposure to corrosion-inducing salt spray (See Conformal Coating). A number of cards were connected and secured to a tray on rollers. In turn, several trays of various types, interconnected and secured to a metal enclosure, constituted the computer. Most NTDS computers were water-cooled, though some later lighter-weight models were air-cooled.\n\nSeymour Cray is credited for developing the first NTDS processor, the AN/USQ-17. However, this design did not go into production.\n\nASW Ships Command & Control System (ASWSC&CS) was a NTDS system for antisubmarine warfare. It was implemented only on the frigates , and the ASW aircraft carrier in 1967. The ASWSC&CS allowed the development of improvements in antisubmarine warfare using digital computers, which were implemented in other ASW ship classes. UNIVAC was contracted to define the hardware and develop the software to incorporate ASW functions.\n\nAN/UYQ-100 Undersea Warfare Decision Support System (USW-DSS) is the current system fielded in 2010. \n\n\n\n"}

At the Ramfjordmoen facility (near Tromsø, Norway), it also operates an ionospheric heater facility, similar to HAARP. Additional receiver stations are located in Sodankylä, Finland, and Kiruna, Sweden. The EISCAT Svalbard radar (ESR) is located in Longyearbyen, Norway. The EISCAT Headquarters are also located in Kiruna.\n\nEISCAT is funded and operated by research institutes and research councils of Norway, Sweden, Finland, Japan, China and the United Kingdom (the EISCAT Associates). Institutes in other countries also contribute to operations, including Russia, Ukraine, Germany and South Korea.\n\nThe system was also tested for space debris tracking and the radars were proven to be capable of statistical observations of Low-Earth orbit (LEO) debris (altitudes of 500 to 1500 km) down to 2 cm in size. Since these measurements are insufficient to determine complete orbits, the radar has only limited space surveillance value. Because the space debris tracking change is only a dedicated back-end computer system, the primary EISCAT observations are not compromised. As a result of that, the EISCAT radars allow continuous monitoring of the LEO debris in a beam park mode, functioning as a space surveillance system part of the European Space Agency's Space Situational Awareness Programme (SSA).\n\nIn 1973, the EISCAT proposal — which was originally planned for France, Germany and the three Nordic countries — seemed moribund. Then, Welsh physicist Granville Beynon became involved and by 1975, the agreement was signed, with the UK as a member. The proposal for UK membership had originally been turned down by the appropriate SRC committee. Beynon, however, persuaded the Board to reverse the decision of the committee and as a result of his efforts, hundreds of European scientists have had the opportunity to use the world's most advanced ionospheric radar.\n\nIn 2008, Doritos embarked upon an \"out-of-this-world\" advertising campaign, literally beaming a 30-second advertisement for Doritos brand tortilla chips into a solar system 42 light years away. This project is in collaboration with EISCAT Space Centre in Svalbard. The \"You Make It, We'll Play It\" contest chose the winning advertisement that was transmitted on June 12, 2008. The ad was beamed towards a distant star, within the Ursa Major constellation which is orbited by planets which may harbor life.\n\nEISCAT operates several facilities north of the Scandinavian arctic circle.\n\nThe Tromsø VHF transmitter, together with the Kiruna and Sodankylä VHF receivers, form a multistatic radar system.\n\nAdditionally, the Kilpisjärvi Atmospheric Imaging Receiver Array (KAIRA), near Kilpisjärvi, Finland can also serve as a VHF receiver in conjunction with the Tromsø transmitter.\n\nEISCAT is planning on building a next generation radar capable of providing 3D monitoring of the atmosphere and ionosphere. The new system is called EISCAT_3D.\n\nIn 2008, the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures selected EISCAT_3D for its \"Roadmap 2008 for Large-Scale European Research Infrastructures for the next 20–30 years.\"\n\nEISCAT_3D will be a multistatic radar composed of five phased-array antenna fields. each field will have around 10,000 crossed dipole antenna elements. All five sites will act as receivers, with a single core site transmitting at 233 MHz (VHF band). The sites will be spread over Finland, Norway and Sweden. Each site will have a central array, surrounded by a set of smaller arrays, providing a high spatial resolution via aperture synthesis.\n\nDuring the summer of 2017, EISCAT will build a 91-element subarray at the site at Ramfjordmoen for hardware testing purposes and the full system is expected to be operational around 2021. The KAIRA system is also a pathfinder for the development of EISCAT_3D.\n\n"}
{"id": "2026820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026820", "title": "Fascioloides magna", "text": "Fascioloides magna\n\nFascioloides magna, also known as giant liver fluke, large American liver fluke or deer fluke, is trematode parasite that occurs in wild and domestic ruminants in North America and Europe. Adult flukes occur in the liver of the definitive host and feed on blood. Mature flukes measure 4 to 10 cm in length × 2 to 3.5 cm in width, and have an oval dorso-ventrally flattened body with oral and ventral sucker. The flukes are reddish-brown in colour and are covered by tegument. As with other digenean trematodes, the life cycle includes intramolluscan phase in snails. The parasite is currently distributed in wild ruminants in North America and Europe, including Austria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia, and the United States.\n\n\"Fascioloides magna\" is essentially of North American origin but the parasite was introduced into Europe with imported game animals at the second half of the 19th century. In spite of being native to North America the fluke was first described in Italy. In 1875, Bassi observed massive deaths of red deer in the Royal Park (now La Mandria Regional Park) near Torino, Italy. The signs were similar to well known fasciolosis in sheep. He named it \"Distomum magnum\". The author believed that the parasite was introduced into the park in wapiti imported from the United States in 1865. Most workers did not accept Bassi’s species because of his poor description. From 1882 to 1892, the fluke was recorded from different areas of the United States and described separately by many authors. Later, Stiles (1894) pointed out that the American findings are identical with species described previously by Bassi. Stiles made a complete morphological description of the adult fluke and named it \"Fasciola magna\" (Bassi 1875) Stiles 1894. In 1917, Ward showed that owing to the lack of the distinct anterior cone and the fact that vitellaria are confined to the region ventral to the intestinal branches, he established a new genus \"Fascioloides\" and rename it to \"Fascioloides magna\" (Bassi 1875) Ward 1917. In 1895, Stiles suggested that the life cycle of the fluke is very similar to \"Fasciola hepatica\", i.e. it includes an aquatic snail as an intermediate host. He gave a comparative description of the egg and miracidium of the fluke. However, first reported intermediate hosts of \"F. magna\" were not published until 1930’s. The complete life cycle of \"F. magna\", including a description of all the larval stages, was described by Swales (1935) in Canada.\n\nThe life cycle of \"F. magna\" is relatively complex and is similar to the development of the related fluke, \"F. hepatica\". A detailed account of the \"F. magna\" life cycle was given by Swales (1935), Erhardová-Kotrlá (1971), and reviewed by Pybus (2001).Adult flukes occur in pairs or groups within a fibrous capsule in the liver parenchyma of the definitive host. Mature flukes release eggs which are collected in the cavity of the capsule. The capsule contains a great mass of eggs and has duct connections to bile ducts. The eggs are passed together with bile into the bile collecting system, enter the small intestine, and leave the definitive host along with the faeces. The eggs which are passed out in the faeces into the environment are undeveloped and undergo embryonation outside the host. Several physical-chemical factors, especially temperature, humidity and oxygen tension, are known to influence embryonation. During the embryonation of the egg, a larva called a miracidium develops from germinal cells. Fully developed miracidium releases the operculum of the egg using several proteases. The embryonation period varies from 27 to 44 days in natural conditions. Ciliated miracidia hatch in water and actively seek suitable intermediate hosts that are freshwater snails from family Lymnaeidae. After attaching to a suitable snail host, the miracidium penetrates into the snail body. After shedding its ciliated cell layer it is called a sporocyst. The sporocysts are found in the foot, the snail body, digestive glands, reproductive organs, and in the pulmonary sac of the snail. The sporocysts contain germinal cells that give rise to 1-6 mother rediae (a trematode larval form with an oral sucker). Developed mother rediae are released from the sporocyst and migrate into digestive glands, renal organ, reproductive organs, and pulmonary sac of the snail body. Each mother redia can asexually produce up to 10 daughter rediae. However, only 3 to 6 daughter rediae complete their development and leave the mother rediae. In turn, each daughter redia may produce 1-6 Trematode lifecycle stages#Typical lifecyle stagescercariae in experimentally infected snails and 16-22 cercariae under natural conditions. Cercariae emerge from the rediae and mature usually in digestive glands of the snail. Mature cercarie spontaneously emerge from the snail host and swim actively in water for up to two hours before encysting on vegetation. After encystment the flukes are called metacercariae. Development within the snail takes 40 to 69 days depending upon the temperature and the species of snail. The definitive host ingests vegetation containing the metacercariae. In the stomach and the intestine, the metacercariae are stimulated to emerge from the cyst (excystation). Newly excysted juvenile flukes penetrate the wall of the intestine and migrate in the abdominal cavity. Juvenile flukes penetrate the Glisson’s capsule of the liver and continue migrating in the liver tissue. Rarely juvenile flukes penetrate other organs, such as lungs or kidneys. In these organs, however, flukes do not survive and not attain maturity. In the liver, flukes migrate within the parenchyma to search another fluke. If the fluke meet another one, they stop moving, and the fibrous capsule is formed around them. In the capsule, the parasite completes its development and starts egg-laying. Prepatent period varies 3–7 months and is dependent on host species. Adult \"F. magna\" can survive in the liver of the host up to 7 years.\n\nCurrently, \"F. magna\" occurs only in North America and Europe where suitable habitat exists and susceptible intermediate hosts are found. However, sporadic works reported unique appearance of the fluke in other continents. \"F. magna\" was found in imported animals in South Africa, Australia and Cuba. In all cases, infected animals (brahman heifer, ox, and elk, respectively) were imported from the United States or Canada.\n\nDuring the 20th century, \"F. magna\" was reported in these American states: Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. Areas of New England are not areas normally inhabited by \"F. magna\", but the fluke has been reported in this region. In Canada, the fluke was reported in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec. Currently, \"F. magna\" is enzootic in five major areas: (1) the Great Lakes region; (2) the Gulf coast, lower Mississippi, and southern Atlantic seaboard; (3) northern Pacific coast; (4) the Rocky Mountain trench; and (5) northern Quebec and Labrador. However, within these broad ranges, actual presence of giant liver flukes varies from locally abundant to locally absent.\n\n\"Fascioloides magna\" was first reported by Bassi in Torino, Italy. In spite of Bassi’s work, no other data concerning the occurrence of F. magna in Europe were reported until 1930’s. In the Czech territory, Ullrich reported the first appearance of \"F. magna \"in fallow deer as late as 1930. At the same time, Salomon (1932) diagnosed the fluke in one hunted red deer near Görlitz (Saxony) in Germany. Other isolated findings of the fluke were recorded in Italy and Poland. From 1948 till 1961, sporadic occurrence of the parasite in red deer (\"Cervus elaphus\"), fallow deer (\"Dama dama\") and roe deer (\"Capreolus capreolus\") were reported by several authors in former Czechoslovakia. However, all reports were published on the basis of incident discoveries in hunted deer and no massive infections were documented.\nIn 1960’s, a number of \"F. magna\" outbreaks in cervids were reported in some areas of former Czechoslovakia. The prevalence of infection varied from 70 to 80% in red deer and maximum parasite burden was 144 worms. In addition, sudden deaths were documented in free or game ranging deer. The highest mortality was reported in free ranging roe deer in Písek County in the South Bohemia of former Czechoslovakia. In the same region, moreover, the parasite was found in livers of slaughtered cattle. Erhardová-Kotrlá (1971) confirmed red deer, fallow deer and roe deer as main definitive hosts of \"F. magna\" in Europe. In 1960’s, \"F. magna\" was enzootic in former Czechoslovakia in following four major areas: (1) České Budějovice and Třeboň county, including Nové Hrady Mountains; (2) the area along the Vltava River on the Vltava-Týn hills near Hluboká and Bechyně; (3) Písek and Milevsko county; (4) the Brdy mountains and the Hřebeny mountains. In following years, \"F. magna\" was only reported from these areas. Recently, geographical distribution of \"F. magna\" in cervids was determined in the Czech Republic. The giant liver fluke was confirmed in the same areas as reported in 1960’s. However, seven new endemic areas of \"F. magna\" were discovered suggesting that the parasite is spreading in the Czech Republic. Moreover, the appearance of \"F. magna\" in the Šumava Mountains has epizootiological importance due to possibility of spread of the parasite into the German territory (Bavaria). During the last few years, a new European enzootic area has established in the Danube watershed in Central Europe. In 1988, \"F. magna\" was isolated from a 3-year old red deer female found dead near the Gabčíkovo water plant at the Danube River in Slovakia. The parasite has spread through whole Slovakian Danube watershed.\nSoon after the Slovakian first report, \"F. magna\" was found in red deer in Hungarian parts of Danubian floodplain forests. The prevalence reported by the same authors was up to 90%. \"F. magna\" infection of cervids is a considerable problem in northern part of Hungary (Szigetköz) and the southern Danubian territory in the Gemenc area. Since the autumn of 2000, \"F. magna\" has been found in Austrian territory, east of Vienna. In years 2000-2001, the prevalence of the giant liver fluke in red deer in Austrian parts of Danube (east of Vienna) was 66.7%. Appearance of American liver fluke was reported in Croatia in January 2000. The prevalence of fascioloidosis among red deer in Hungary was 21,1-60,7 % between 1998-2005. During the necropsy of 459 deer livers (using Egri's method) the number of flukes per host ranged from 1 to 138 in the same period. Regarding the origin of \"F. magna\" enzootic area in the Danube River watershed, it is essential to point out that cervids were not introduced into these localities, neither recently nor in the past. Origin of the \"F. magna\" population in Danubian floodplain forests in Central Europe remains therefore unclear.\n\nNatural infections of \"F. magna\" occur primarily in cervids and bovids. Although many species are susceptible to infection, only a few cervid species contribute significantly to maintaining populations of the fluke. In North America, the common definitive hosts of the giant liver fluke are wapiti (\"Cervus elaphus canadensis\"), white-tailed deer (\"Odocoileus virginianus\") and caribou (\"Rangifer tarandus\"). In Europe, \"F. magna\" occurs commonly in red deer (\"Cervus elaphus\"), fallow deer (\"Dama dama\") and roe deer (\"Capreolus capreolus\"). Domestic ruminants are also susceptible to natural infection with \"F. magna\". However, the infection is not patent, and domestic ruminants do not contribute to the propagation of the parasite in the environment. In North America, the giant liver fluke is commonly found in cattle, sheep and goats in areas where \"F. magna\" is enzootic in deer. In contrast, \"F. magna\" occurs rarely in domestic ruminants in Europe. The list of all natural definitive hosts of \"F. magna\" is presented in Table. Humans are not known to be a definitive host.\n\nThe only indigenous primary definitive host of \"F. magna\" is white-tailed deer. This species has been parasitized by the fluke for the longest time in historical context. Wapiti and caribou are of Eurasian origin and entered North America during the Pleistocene epoch, and overlapped with white-tailed deer in some parts of North America. They might have encountered \"F. magna\" in these shared biotopes.\n\nDefinitive hosts are primarily New World and some Old World cervids. In definitive hosts, flukes are encapsulated in thin-walled fibrous capsules communicating to the bile system. The eggs are passed through the bile system, enter the small intestine, and leave the host with faeces. Therefore, the infection is patent. The capsules are a result of the defence response of the host to the parasite and are pathognomonic for \"F. magna\" infection. They contain two to five flukes, greyish-black fluid with eggs and cell detritus.\n\n\"F. magna\" infections in definitive hosts are usually subclinical. However, massive deaths caused by the fluke in red-, fallow- and roe deer were reported. Lethargy, depression, weight loss and decreased quality of antlers can occur sporadically. In addition, nervous symptoms were observed very rarely. In the first case, urging motion followed by apathy was reported in one experimentally infected fallow deer. Authors suggested that these symptoms were associated with hepatocerebral syndrome. Other author has observed partial paralysis in naturally infected wapiti caused by migrating juvenile flukes in the spinal cord.\nBiochemical and haematological profiles are little investigated in definitive hosts. A decrease of haemoglobin, elevation of γ-globulins, and increase of eosinophils in serum was observed in experimentally infected white-tailed deer.\n\nDead-end hosts are represented by large bovids, suids, llamas, horses and some Old World cervids. Infections in dead-end hosts are characterized by excessive fibrosis, thick-walled encapsulation of flukes within hepatic parenchyma, and black pigmentation of various tissues. Both afferent and efferent bile ducts are totally occluded and are marked by tracts of fibrous tissue. The eggs can not be passed into the bile system, and, therefore, the infection is not patent. In addition, flukes rarely mature in dead-end hosts probably due to strong immune response. Nevertheless, appearance of \"F. magna\" eggs in the faeces of a single experimentally infected calf has been documented. Rarely have the pathophysiology or clinical symptoms in dead-end hosts have been studied. In cattle, significant elevations of eosinophil counts in periphery blood but only slight increases of AST and GGT have been observed. While American authors have not observed any clinical symptoms in cattle, anorexia and weight loss were recorded in naturally infected bulls in the former Czechoslovakia.\n\nAberrant hosts of \"F. magna\" are sheep and goats. However, the course of infection is similar in guinea pigs, rabbits, bighorn sheep (\"Ovis canadensis\") and chamois (\"Rupicapra rupicapra\") that were infected experimentally. Infections in aberrant hosts are characterized by excessive wandering of juvenile flukes and death of the host. Aberrant hosts die usually within 6 months post-infection and the death is associated with acute peritonitis or extensive haemorrhage caused by migrating flukes. In aberrant hosts, flukes do not mature and migrate until the host dies. Occasionally, a few flukes mature and eggs can be found in the faeces. Hepatic lesions in aberrant hosts generally include firm adhesions of the liver to the diaphragm, black pigmentation, hematomas, necroses, and haemorrhagic tracts in which juvenile flukes are located. While a lack of fibrous capsules within hepatic parenchyma has been reported by several authors, flukes in fibrous capsules have also been documented in sheep. However, the wall of the capsule is different from those found in cervids and large bovids. The dominant feature is a diffuse fibrosis throughout the liver and haemorrhagic migratory tracts containing erythrocytes, black pigment, and cell detritus. The liver lesions are infiltrated by eosinophils, plasma cells, and pigment-laden macrophages.\nSheep and goats die acutely without any previous clinical signs. Only elevation of eosinophils and slight increase of γ-globulins were observed in experimentally infected sheep. Recently, several changes in biochemical and haematological profile have been documented in experimentally infected goats. The significant increase of GLDH (glutamate dehydrogenase) was recorded from 14 weeks after infection in goats experimentally infected with \"F. magna\".\n\nSince the presence of an intermediate host is essential to the completion of the life cycle, snails occupy the important role in the epidemiology of \"F. magna\". The intermediate hosts of the giant liver fluke belong to the family Lymnaeidae. In North America, a total of 10 lymnaeid snails were reported as intermediate hosts of \"F. magna\". 6 of 10 North American snail species were found naturally infected and the other four were infected only under experimental conditions. In addition, the Australian species \"Austropeplea\" (\"Lymnaea\") \"tomentosa\" was exposed to the North American isolate of \"F. magna\" and the parasite was able to complete its development. The most common North American natural snail hosts of the fluke are \"Fossaria\" (\"Galba\") \"modicella\", \"Stagnicola\" (\"Lymnaea\") \"caperata\" and \"Fossaria\" (\"Galba\") \"bulimoides techella\". In Europe, an intermediate host had not been known until 1960’s. At the beginning, Ślusarski assumed that \"Lymnaea stagnalis\" could act as an intermediate host of \"F. magna\" in Europe. His assumption, however, has been neither confirmed by positive findings in the field nor by experimental infection. In 1961, Dr. Erhardová described the life cycle of \"F. magna\" based on observations of experimentally and naturally infected snails. She confirmed that \"Galba truncatula\" is an intermediate host of the giant liver fluke in Europe. In later works, the author studied another lymnaeid species in the former Czechoslovakia. However, \"G. truncatula\" was repeatedly confirmed as the only snail host of \"F. magna\". In 1979, Chroustová reported successful experimental infection of \"Stagnicola\" (\"Lymnaea\") \"palustris\" with \"F. magna\". She considered that this species might serve as an intermediate host of the fluke in the environment. Nevertheless, no naturally infected snails were found. Recent studies indicate that another lymnaeid snail, \"Radix peregra\", may be also involved in the transmission of \"F. magna\" in Europe. This opinion is supported by successful experimental infection of \"R. peregra\" in the lab as well as by findings of naturally infected \"R. peregra\" in the environment These findings suggested that the intermediate host spectrum of \"F. magna\" should be, similarly to North America, diverse in Europe. The list of intermediate hosts of \"F. magna\" is presented in following table.\n\n(*) Snails originated from Australia infected with United States isolate of \"F. magna\"\n(**) Snails originated from France infected with Czech isolate of \"F. magna\"\n\nAccording to several American authors, three types of definitive host exist:\nPathology of \"F. magna\" infection varies according to host type but some features are shared by all three types. Primary lesions usually occur in the liver and are associated with mechanical damage due to migrating juvenile flukes or fibrous encapsulation of sedentary adult flukes. The most common feature of \"F. magna\" infection is black pigmentation in abdominal or thoracic organs, especially in the liver. The hematin pigment is produced by flukes as a byproduct of feeding on blood. Pigment within tissues is a result of migrating of juvenile flukes and it accumulates within hepatic cells without resorption. \"F. magna\" has also been associated with Red Water disease in bovine. \"F. magna\" causes liver damage, which allows the bacteria \"Clostridium haemolyticum\" to cause secondary infection in hepatic tissue. The infection will decrease the livers function, and the host's urine will become red, hence the name \"Red Water\" disease.\n\nWhile the eggs of \"F. magna\" resemble those of \"F. hepatica\", this similarity is of limited use; eggs usually are not passed in cattle and sheep. Recovery of the parasites at necropsy, as well as proper identification of \"F. hepatica\" or \"F. gigantica\" is necessary for definite diagnosis. When domestic ruminants and deer share the same grazing areas, the presence of disease due to \"F. magna\" should be kept in mind. Mixed infections with \"F. hepatica\" occur in cattle.\n\n For control of fascioloidosis in wild ruminants, successful application of anthelminthics in feed is necessary. The drug has to have flavour and smell that do not prevent animals from eating medicated feed. In addition, there should adequate therapeutic scope, i.e. span between therapeutic and minimal toxic dose. Therefore, only some of anthelminthics that are efficient in domestic ruminants have been tested in wild ruminants infected with \"F. magna\". Several drugs, namely oxyclozanide, rafoxanide, albendazole, diamphenetide, closantel, clorsulon, and triclabendazole, have been used in control of \"F. magna\" infection in cervids. However, the results have differed between different authors. In the same way as for \"F. hepatica\", triclabendazole seems to be the most effective against \"F. magna\". Fascioloidosis of cervids was successfully controlled with triclabendazole in the United States, and triclabendazole with levamizole in Hungary, Canada, Austria, and Croatia. In contrast, rafoxanide is commonly used in treatment in Czech Republic Slovakia and Hungary. Nevertheless, recent studies suggested that use of rafoxanide in control of \"F. magna\" infection should be considered. Unfortunately, rafoxanide in a commercial drug called Rafendazol Premix is the only registered drug for wild ruminants. Triclabendazole and others are produced as drugs for domestic animals and it can be used in free-living animals only with special permit. In some cases, it may be difficult to determine if \"F. magna\" or a different fluke such as \"Fasciola hepatica\" or \"Fasciola gigantica\" is causing pathology since all these flukes will have the same clinical signs. In the case that the identity of the trematode cannot be determined, the drug triclabendazole can be used since this will deal with all three parasites.\n\nIn North America, especially in Wisconsin, flukes found inside deer livers are sometimes consumed by humans, sautéed in butter. They are served as \"liver butterflies\", \"little livers\" or \"little flapjacks\".\n\n\n"}

WWL is a long-time affiliate of the CBS Radio Network. The station's studios are located at the 400 Poydras Tower in the New Orleans Central Business District and the transmitter site is in Estelle, Louisiana. \n\nWWL is the Louisiana Primary entry Point for the Emergency Alert System, and with sister station WLMG are responsible for activations of the Southeast Louisiana EAS plan.\n\nWWL broadcasts an HD signal on WWL-FM 105.3 HD1.\n\nWWL's weekday schedule features news and talk programming mornings and early afternoons, shifting to sports talk and live play-by-play after 4 p.m. All weekday programming from 5 a.m. to midnight is hosted by local WWL personalities and reporters. The only nationally syndicated programs are paranormal show \"Beyond Reality\" at 11 p.m., family finances expert Dave Ramsey at 1 a.m. and \"This Morning, America's First News with Gordon Deal\", an hour of early morning news, at 4 a.m. WWL continues to cover the post-Hurricane Katrina rebuilding of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast region with local news and talk programming.\n\nWeekend programming includes shows on money, law, gardening, home improvement, cars and dining before sports takes over the schedule. Most hours on weekdays begin with local newscasts branded as \"WWL First News\", while CBS News Radio begins most hours on nights and weekends.\n\nBefore the Jesuit priests who run Loyola University New Orleans could set up a radio station, they had to receive permission from the Vatican. The station was originally created as a laboratory for wireless technology. WWL began broadcasting as a 10-watt station at 833 kHz from the Marquette Hall on the Loyola campus on March 31, 1922. A piano recital was the first program on the air. The first broadcast day also included a three-minute request to listeners to support the construction of a new classroom building on campus. By 1924, WWL had 100 watts of power at 1070 kHz, and a year later the station was at 1090 kHz. The station's frequency went up to 1220 kHz along with the power at 500 watts in 1927. WWL, now at 850 kHz, increased power to 5000 watts on March 31, 1929 following the installation of a new transmitter in Loyola's Bobet Hall. In 1932, the station was at 10,000 watts of power, and in 1937 it reached 50,000 watts. WWL-AM affiliated with the CBS Radio Network on November 1, 1935. Effective March 29, 1941, WWL was settled at its current position: 870 kHz.\n\nIn the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, the station was famous for the live broadcasts of local Dixieland jazz bands, including such notables as Papa Celestin, Sharkey Bonano, Irving Fazola, Tony Almarico, and Lizzie Miles. WWL's television partner WWL-TV came on the air on September 7, 1957 and was also affiliated with CBS. The first WWL-FM at 101.9 MHz (now WLMG-FM) signed on in March 1970 with its own music format. On Oct. 21, 1960, WWL got a mention on the \"Route 66\" TV series in the episode, \"The Swan Bed,\" in an opening scene when Todd and Buzz turn the car radio on and hear the announcer give the call letters as they are driving across the Greater New Orleans Bridge. WWL's transmitter in Kenner, Louisiana on the south shore of Lake Pontchartrain was moved to Estelle, Louisiana in 1975.\n\nStarting on March 14, 1971, WWL became home to the long-running overnight country music program aimed at truck drivers called The Road Gang. They claimed their frequency was \"Interstate 87\" and offered strip weather in major cites along the east-west National Defense Highways I-10, I-20, I-30, etc. Advertising was focused on long-haul truckers. It was originally hosted by Charlie Douglas. Later hosts included Dave Nemo and Big John Parker. The station helped popularize southern gospel by late-night broadcasts of the Mull Singing Convention.\n\nLoyola sold WWL, WLMG-FM, and WWL-TV to separate companies in 1989 to build the university endowment. That same year, the university began broadcasting on WLDC within the university’s electrical grid. Keymarket Communications in Greenville, South Carolina became the new owner of WWL and WLMG-FM. Baltimore, Maryland-based company Sinclair Broadcast Group would assume ownership of both stations in 1996 and Entercom Communications in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania in 1999.\n\nLoyola maintains its broadcasting legacy with Crescent City Radio, an internet radio station broadcasting from the Communications/Music Complex on the corner of Calhoun and St. Charles Avenue.\n\nWWL has been \"monogrammed\" into the Internal Revenue Code. A section excluding certain types of income of nonprofit organizations from income tax mentions entities licensed by federal agencies (like the station's FCC license) and carried on by religious orders (like the Jesuits). The three subsections of this tax provision, 26 U.S.C. 512(b)(15), begin with W, W, and L, respectively. The exclusion was directed at WWL specifically, and the joke has been attributed to Senator Russell Long of Louisiana.\n\nDuring the immediate effects and aftermath of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in late August 2005, WWL was for a time one of the few if not only radio station(s) in the area remaining on the air. Announcer Garland Robinette for a time kept broadcasting from an improvised studio built in a closet after the studio's windows were blown out.\n\nAfter the hurricane, WWL's emergency coverage was simulcast on the frequencies of numerous other radio stations. The broadcast was named \"The United Radio Broadcasters of New Orleans\"; mostly WWL staff appeared on-air. The United Radio Broadcasters were a partnership between Entercom and competitor Clear Channel Communications. The WWL website was completely rebuilt in only one day by the staff of other Entercom stations. The company also dispatched staffers from stations throughout the country to help WWL, and to provide their own stations coverage from the hurricane ravaged New Orleans area. For some time after Hurricane Katrina, WWL was simulcast on shortwave outlet WHRI, owned by World Harvest Radio International.\n\nIn April 2006, WWL permanently returned to the FM airwaves, simulcasting on WWL-FM 105.3.\n\nAs a part-time NBC Sports Radio affiliate, programming from that network is heard Friday and Saturday nights, and in several blocks during the day and evening on Sunday. When two live sporting events occur at the same time, WWL moves one of the games to its sister station, WWWL, which switched to a mostly sports format in November 2006.\n\nWWL has for many years been the flagship station for broadcasts of New Orleans Saints football games, continuously since the 1995 season. Jim Henderson and ex-Saint Hokie Gajan were the broadcast team from 2000 until Gajan's death from cancer on April 11, 2016. Prior to the 1998 NFL Draft, when son Peyton Manning was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts, Archie Manning provided commentary on WWL's Saints coverage from his retirement as a player in 1985 through 1997.\n\nFormer Saint Deuce McAllister succeeded Gajan as Henderson's color commentator in 2016. Longtime Saints offensive tackle Stan Brock was Henderson's commentator in 1998 and 1999.\n\nWWL is also the New Orleans flagship of the LSU Tigers, broadcasting all football games on WWL and FM, and all men's basketball and baseball games on either WWL or WWL-FM. It was previously the radio home of the Tulane Green Wave.\n\n"}

He was the brother of Henry Erskine and Lord Erskine. He studied at St. Andrews University (1755-59) Edinburgh University (1760-62) and Glasgow University (1762-63). He studied under Adam Smith, and Joseph Black. He married, on 15 October 1771, his second cousin Margaret Fraser (d. 12 May 1819), the great-granddaughter of David Erskine, 9th Earl of Buchan. They had no children.\n\nHis active criticism helped to effect a change in the method of electing Scottish representative peers to the House of Lords.\n\nHe was offered the post of Secretary at the British Embassy in Madrid in 1766–67 but declined it due to the illness of his father who died in 1767. He was also the Grand Master of Scottish Freemasons from 1782 to 1784.\n\nHe was friends with Benjamin Franklin, originating probably from Franklin's visit to Scotland in 1759 and met him several times in London in 1764. A supporter of the American cause, he corresponded with George Washington and sent him a box made from the oak that hid William Wallace after the Battle of Falkirk. The box was designed by the Goldsmith Company of Edinburgh, and the earl requested that Washington, upon his death, pass it on to the man in his country who he believed should merit it best, and upon the same conditions that induced the earl to send it to Washington. In his will Washington thanked the earl for presenting the box to him along with sentiments which accompanied it; feeling incapable of making the choice asked of him he bequeathed the box back to the earl.\n\nIn 1780 he founded the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. As he outlined in a letter of November 1780 he wished to create a body to promote antiquarian researches in that part of Great Britain. It drew on traditions that involved Sir John Scot of Scotstarvit, (who preserved the cartographic work of Timothy Pont and others) Sir Robert Sibbald, and Sir John Clerk of Penicuik. The Society of Antiquaries of Scotland was formally constituted on 18 December 1780. He later disagreed with some policies of the Society and withdrew in 1790.\n\nHowever, after withdrawing from the management of the Society of Antiquaries he remained active in the area, contributing papers and became involved with the Literary and Antiquarian Society of Perth in 1785. Erskine was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1816. He was also elected to honorary membership of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters in 1785 and of its Icelandic counterpart in 1791.\n\nSpending much of his later time at Dryburgh he embellished the grounds with monuments including commemorations of his ancestors and of Robert Burns and William Wallace. He also commissioned a cable-stayed bridge over the River Tweed at Dryburgh. He opened this bridge on 1 August 1817 but it collapsed within months. A replacement was built after a redesign, but this too collapsed in 1838. A more permanent bridge did not arrive until 1872, when the suspension system was used instead.\n\nIn later years he became increasingly eccentric a trait which tended to obscure his talents, as was noted by Sir Walter Scott.\n\nHis correspondents included Horace Walpole, and he produced an \"Essay on the Lives of Fletcher of Saltoun and the Poet Thomson\" (1792) and several other writings. He died at his residence at Dryburgh (near Dryburgh Abbey, in the Scottish Borders) in April 1829, leaving no legitimate children, and the earldom passed to his nephew Henry though all his non-entailed properties including Dryburgh were passed to his illegitimate son, Sir David Erskine \n\nThere is an interesting story concerning the Earl in which the writer George Dyer brought him to meet Charles Lamb at his flat in Mitre Court Buildings. Charles Lamb was not home and his sister Mary Lamb was deeply flustered at having to greet an Earl unannounced in her household.\n\n \n"}
