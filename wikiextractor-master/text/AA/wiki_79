His FIFA World Cup profile describes him as \"a tackling machine and expert ball-winner, but he also boasts a fine array of passes and a powerful shot, having been a free-kick specialist during his PSV days\". When he played for Bayern Munich, he was the club's first non-German captain. During this period, he led the team to two Bundesliga titles, and finished runner-up in the 2010 UEFA Champions League Final.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2011, Van Bommel won eight national championship titles in four different competitions, four with PSV, two with Bayern Munich, one with Barcelona and one with Milan. He is also the son-in-law of former Netherlands national team manager Bert van Marwijk.\n\nVan Bommel started his amateur career at local club RKVV Maasbracht before earning a professional contract with Fortuna Sittard in 1992. His colleagues at Fortuna who would later join PSV alongside him were Wilfred Bouma and Kevin Hofland.\n\nVan Bommel was signed by PSV in 1999 where he formed a midfield partnership with Swiss international Johann Vogel. Van Bommel won four Eredivisie titles and two Johan Cruyff Shields with the club. He was also named Dutch Footballer of the Year in 2001 and 2005.\n\nIn his final season with PSV, having assisted the team to the Dutch league title and a Champions League semi-final place, Van Bommel was expected to join his father-in-law Bert van Marwijk who at the time managed the Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund, but Van Bommel opted to stay at PSV until the end of the 2004–05 season.\n\nAfter the club's UEFA Champions League semi-final loss to Milan and with the Eredivisie title in PSV's hands at the end of April, he confirmed he would join Barcelona in May 2005 after the club won its own domestic league.\n\nSeeking to strengthen his already title-winning squad, Frank Rijkaard signed Van Bommel on a free transfer for Barcelona. Van Bommel spent the summer prior to his move to Spain learning the Spanish language in a convent in Eindhoven. Similar to his role at PSV where he was largely used as a holding midfielder, utilising his ball-winning skills to complement the more skillful players already at the club. As per his squad role, throughout the league campaign he was rotated with fellow midfielders Xavi, Edmílson, Andrés Iniesta, Deco and Thiago Motta, featuring in 24 domestic matches and a further 12 in cup competitions. His only season with Barcelona was largely successful as the club won La Liga and the 2005–06 Champions League. He won his third trophy with the club on 20 August 2006 as Barça beat city rivals Espanyol in the 2006 Supercopa de España. Six days later, however, it was announced that Van Bommel had joined Bayern Munich.\n\nOn 26 August 2006, Bayern Munich team manager Uli Hoeneß announced Van Bommel would be joining the Bundesliga club. Media reports speculated that the move was influenced by the ongoing Owen Hargreaves transfer saga, but Hoeneß insisted the club intended to go forward with both players. Bayern Munich paid 6 million euro to Barcelona in the deal.\n\nSoon after joining the Bavarian side, Van Bommel proved to be a key player for them, providing strength in the middle of the pitch. Due to his terrific performances during his first season at Bayern, he was voted the Bayern Player of the Year for 2006–07, beating out longtime fan-favorites Roy Makaay and Mehmet Scholl. In the 2007–08 season, he won his first silverware with club as Bayern claimed a double of the Bundesliga title and DFB-Pokal.\n\nAfter Oliver Kahn retired in 2008, Van Bommel was selected as captain, becoming the club's first ever non-German captain.\n\nUnder the management of compatriot Louis van Gaal, Van Bommel led Bayern to the second league and cup double of his time at the club during the 2009–10 season. The team also reached the 2010 UEFA Champions League Final, but a defeat by Internazionale denied Bayern its first ever treble.\n\nOn 25 January 2011, Van Bommel signed a six-month contract with Milan on a free transfer after terminating his contract with Bayern. He was given the number four shirt, and the day after, he made his debut in a 2–1 victory against Sampdoria in the Coppa Italia quarter-final. On 29 January 2011, Van Bommel made his Serie A debut against Catania but was sent off after receiving a second yellow card early in the second half. Soon after, however, he adapted to Italian football and became a regular in Massimiliano Allegri's squad, contributing greatly in convincing 3–0 wins against Napoli and city rivals Internazionale. He was a starter in the match against Roma on 7 May 2011 that brought Milan their 18th \"Scudetto\".\n\nOn 17 May 2011, Milan announced that Van Bommel had extended his contract for one more year. In the second season of his stint at Milan, he continued to be a starter and occupied the defensive midfielder position throughout the season. He decided not to stay with Milan for another season, despite being offered a new contract.\n\nOn 29 April 2012, Van Bommel announced that he would sign a contract with PSV, who confirmed the signing on 14 May. After a disappointing season in which PSV finished second in the Eredivisie and lost the KNVB Cup final to AZ, Van Bommel announced his retirement from professional football on 12 May 2013. In an interview after his last professional game (against Twente in a 3–1 loss during which he was sent off after receiving two yellow cards), Van Bommel expressed an interest in a coaching career. He cited his desire to make way for younger players to shine and rest his body, specifically his injured left knee.\n\nVan Bommel's debut for the Netherlands was a 4–0 on 7 October 2000 against Cyprus. However, he did not make an appearance in a major tournament until 2006, with the Netherlands failing to qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup and injury preventing him from playing during UEFA Euro 2004 in Portugal.\nNational team manager Marco van Basten was dissatisfied with Van Bommel's defensive performance in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Romania and he was subsequently not selected for the rest of the qualification series. With many Dutch football observers believing Van Bommel's international career to be over, he was selected back into the Dutch side for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n\nAt the 2006 World Cup, Van Bommel played in three of the games for his country (all except the match against Argentina, where both teams had already sealed their passage to the knockout stage of the tournament). He was substituted twice in these three matches. His position in the team was as right-half. His duties were mainly to play the anchor role in the Dutch three-man midfield in their usual 4–3–3 formation.\nA notoriously hard-tackling competitor, he was the first of many players booked in the second-round defeat against Portugal, dubbed \"The Battle of Nuremberg\" by the press. After the World Cup, Van Bommel was not called up for the Euro 2008 qualifiers against Luxembourg and Belarus. In September 2006, after his move to Bayern Munich, he was added to Van Basten's squad to face Bulgaria; however, Van Bommel stated (alongside Ruud van Nistelrooy) he would not play for \"Oranje\" as long as Van Basten was in charge. After Van Basten left to manage Ajax, new Netherlands head coach (and father-in-law) Bert van Marwijk recalled Van Bommel, which led to his return in the Dutch national team. Van Bommel was part of the starting line-up in the Dutch team for the 2010 World Cup, managed by Van Marwijk.\n\nVan Bommel was selected by Van Marwijk to succeed Giovanni van Bronckhorst as the new captain of the Netherlands, despite initial claims he did not want to be the new captain, having been absent from the national team for two years. He captained the side for the first time in a 5–0 away win against San Marino. Against San Marino, Van Bommel captained the Netherlands to a record-breaking 11–0 victory in Eindhoven on 2 September 2011.\n\nFollowing the Netherlands' elimination from the Euro 2012, Van Bommel retired from international football.\n\nVan Bommel started his coaching career as an assistant manager in January 2014, joining the Netherlands U17 national team under Maarten Stekelenburg. On 1 September 2015, he joined his father-in-law Bert van Marwijk at the Saudi Arabia national team, serving as assistant there for two years. On 25 April 2017, he was appointed head coach of the PSV youth (U19) team. On 23 March 2018, he reunited with van Marwijk at the Australia national team, assisting him at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\nOn 22 June 2018, PSV announced Van Bommel as manager on a three-year deal. He replaced Phillip Cocu, who had left for Fenerbahçe. On 16 December 2019, Van Bommel was sacked by PSV.\n\n\"Statistics accurate as of 3 May 2016\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVan Bommel is married to Andra, daughter of Bert van Marwijk, with whom he has three children: Thomas, Ruben and Renée.\n\n\n"}

His parents, Edward and Nellie (Kearney) Boughal, were Irish immigrants.\n\nHe performed in vaudeville for years. After making his first film, 1941's \"Convoy\", Carney signed a contract at RKO Pictures and appeared in choice supporting roles in such films as \"Mr. Lucky\".\n\nIn 1943, Carney teamed up with Wally Brown as RKO's answer to Abbott and Costello. In addition to their inexpensive starring vehicles, Brown and Carney co-starred in \"Step Lively\", a musical remake of the Marx Brothers film \"Room Service\". Wally played Chico's part, while Alan Carney filled in for Harpo; the \"Groucho\" role was essayed by George Murphy. The comedy team was also featured on a live USO tour arranged by the studio.\n\nAfter 1946's \"Genius at Work\", RKO terminated the team's contracts. Alan Carney continued in films and TV as a supporting player, working prolifically at Disney Studios in the 1960s and 1970s. One of Carney's best latter-day roles was as Mayor Dawgmeat in the 1959 musical film \"Li'l Abner\".\n\nCarney appeared with Wally Brown in \"Who Was That Lady?\" (1960) and in Walt Disney's \"The Absent-Minded Professor\" (1961), but they never appeared in the same scenes together.

The van accident was somewhat of an inspiration for the band's song writing. By this point, vocalist Chris Conley \"really felt confident\" and subsequently had \"a lot more fun\" while writing. Conley had a personal recording studio set-up where he would \"spend the entire day\" in \"building songs in my own little world.\" In April, it was announced the band had signed to Vagrant Records due to the success of \"Through Being Cool\" (1999). Later that month, Punknews.org reported that the group would release their next album in early 2001. In January 2001, Punknews.org reported that the band was recording with Steve Evetts, who had produced the group's previous two albums.\n\nRecording began on March 17, 2001 and continued into April with producer Rob Schnapf. Conley described Schnapf as \"a really mellow, laid back guy. Him being relaxed just made for a nice, creative environment in the studio.\" Recording was spread over three studios: Sunset Sound and Sound Factory in Hollywood, California, and Sonora Sound in Los Feliz, California. Doug Boehm recorded the proceedings with assistance from Steven Rhodes and Seth Mclain. Josh Turner acted as the Pro Tools engineer during the sessions. Productivity was initially slow due to, as the band explains, \"some difficulty we're having with tuning guitars\". Richard Barron performed organ on \"Cars & Calories\". Schnapf and Boehm mixed the recordings, while Don C. Tyler mastered them at Precision Mastering. 13 tracks were recorded in total, including two outtakes \"Ups and Downs\" and \"For Erminie\".\n\nThe album was a shift from the band's previous power chord-based sound and featured more intricate guitar work and arrangements. \"Cars & Calories\" talks about celebrity culture. Conley explained that he was \"felt sort of mildly alienated at different points in my life just looking at culture, especially this hectic, modern culture.\" Conley wrote the song in an empty room at Vagrant Records' offices. He played open chords, and the rest of the song soon followed. \"As Your Ghost Takes Flight\" is about a friend's heroin addiction.\n\nIn early June 2001, an MP3 of \"See You\" was posted on PopPunk.com. The group embarked on a brief two-week US tour, leading into a few shows in Japan later in the month. After initially planned for release on June 5, \"Stay What You Are\" was eventually released on July 10 through Vagrant Records. The group was planned to appear on the Warped Tour, however, they instead headlined the Vagrant America Tour between early July and early September. \"At Your Funeral\" was released as a radio single in September. Also during that month, a music video was filmed for the song in Los Angeles. It features a creative way of motion control, similar to \"Requiem for a Dream\". Following the Vagrant America Tour, drummer Bryan Newman left the band to study at college. His position was temporarily filled by Damon Atkinson of Hey Mercedes.\n\nIn November and December, the group went on tour with Hey Mercedes and Thursday. In February 2002, the band supported Weezer on the Hyper Extended Midget Tour in the US. In May, a music video was filmed for \"Freakish\", featuring Muppet-esque puppets. The band supported on Blink-182 and Green Day on their co-headlining Pop Disaster Tour in May and June. In August, the band went on the Vagrant America 2002 arena tour, alongside other Vagrant Records bands. In October and November, the group went on a headlining US tour with support from Ash.\n\nThe album sold 15,000 copies in the first week, and 70,000 copies by the end of the year. By March 2002, the album had sold over 120,000 copies, becoming one of Vagrant's best-selling releases. \"Stay What You Are\" reached number 100 on the \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart.\n\nIn the years since its release, \"Stay What You Are\" is widely regarded as a classic and a highly influential piece of music for the emo and pop punk genres. \"NME\" listed the album as one of \"20 Emo Albums That Have Resolutely Stood The Test Of Time\". Similarly, \"Houston Press\" included the listed the album as one of the best emo albums of 2001–2005. \"Paste\" included the video for \"At Your Funeral\" at number seven of their 10 Best Emo Music Videos list.

He began playing for the Yorkshire Under 18s and then the North East Under 18s. While his schoolmates were attending university open days, he was visiting professional rugby union clubs. He eventually chose Gloucester Rugby. His Gloucester Rugby debut was against Rotherham in 2001, when he scored a superb individual try.\n\nHe represented England at the Hong Kong Sevens in 2002 and scored a hat trick in the final, which England won. He flew back and followed it up with a hat trick in a club game against Bath. Four days before his twentieth birthday he rounded Jonah Lomu to score a famous try for an uncapped England XV against the Barbarians at Twickenham.\n\nHe made his international debut for England against New Zealand in November 2002. An injury to his foot meant that he missed a tour to Argentina. He recovered for the Autumn internationals against Australia and New Zealand but was diagnosed with glandular fever and missed out on playing against South Africa. He was playing again within a few months and was able to be a part of Gloucester Rugby winning the Powergen Cup, in the final of which he started and scored two tries.\n\nHe narrowly missed selection to the final 30 for the 2003 Rugby World Cup because of a back problem, although he had celebrated his first Six Nations Championship start some months earlier with a try in the match against Italy. Unluckily, injury once again prevented him playing a part in the 2004 Autumn series in November and he missed further game time for the build up to the 2005 Six Nations. Picked in the centre for England's final 2005 Autumn test against Samoa but a hip injury forced him off at half-time.\n\nIn 2006, he made the squad for England's tour of Australia and scored two tries in their win over the Barbarians on 28 May. However, he suffered a dead leg midweek during training, and as a result missed both tests, in which England were resoundingly beaten.\n\nOnce more, he was beset by bad luck and suffered a comminuted fracture of his collarbone in a pre-season match for Gloucester Rugby, which greatly reduced his chances of playing in the autumn tests.\n\nHe was recalled to the England squad for the 2007 Summer Tour of South Africa, alongside club colleagues Andy Hazell, Nick Wood, Iain Balshaw, Anthony Allen and Alex Brown. After fantasic performances for Gloucester throughout the 2007–08 season, Simpson-Daniel was named Guinness Premiership Player of The Season beating Olly Barkley and teammate Akapusi Qera.\n\nSimpson-Daniel was called into the England Saxons squad to face Italy A in Ragusa, Sicily on 9 February 2008.\n\nFollowing some great performances with his top of the league club Gloucester, Simpson-Daniel was called into the England squad for the team to face Scotland on 8 March 2008. Called into the 2011 Rugby World Cup training squad, on 1 August 2011 Simpson-Daniel was one of five players released by manager Martin Johnson.\n\nOn 2 September 2014, James Simpson-Daniel announced his retirement due to an ongoing ankle injury.\n\nSimpson-Daniel's older brother Chris was also a professional rugby player for Newcastle Falcons and Worcester, however his career was curtailed by injury.\n\n"}

He was the son of The 3rd Marquess of Bute and Hon. Gwendolen Fitzalan-Howard, a daughter of The 1st Baron Howard of Glossop and granddaughter of The 13th Duke of Norfolk.\n\nHe was educated at Harrow School, and succeeded his father as Marquess of Bute in October 1900, when he was nineteen years old. In early 1902 he was on a tour in the Far East. On reaching his majority in June 1902, he received the Honorary Freedom of the Burgh of Rothesay, and later the same month took the oath and his seat in the House of Lords.\n\nThe 4th Marquess, like his father, had a passion for architecture and was responsible for restoring Caerphilly Castle in South Wales. In 1936 he published a pamphlet entitled \"\"A Plea for Scotland's Architectural Heritage\"\", which argued for the preservation of Scotland's smaller burgh dwellings and advocated reconditioning traditional working class housing, rather than wholesale demolition.

Joseph Wolpe dubbed her \"the mother of behavior therapy\" due to her famous study of Peter and development of desensitization.\n\nCover Jones was the middle child of three born to Carrie Louise Higson and Charles Blair Cover. She had a brother who was five years older than her and a sister who was four years younger than her. Jones' mother was a homemaker involved in several local community organizations while her father was a businessman. Due to regretting not attending post-secondary education himself, Jones encouraged his children to attend university. Visiting Chautauqua Institute on Lake Erie, Ohio became a yearly summer trip for the Cover family during Cover Jones' childhood.\n\nAfter being accepted into Vassar College, Cover Jones chose to study psychology. She took every psychology course offered at Vassar College except one that was offered by Margaret Floy Washburn. Washburn refused to admit her into the class because of a poor laboratory grade in a previous class. She spent her summer vacations, during her time in college, working with poor children in summer camps and settlement houses. Soon after graduating from Vassar College, in 1919, Cover Jones attended a lecture by the noted behaviorist John B. Watson, in New York City. After hearing Watson's lecture, Mary wondered if conditioning could be used to eliminate fears. In 1919, she began her graduate work at Columbia University, and in the summer of 1920 she completed her master's degree. Mary Cover married a fellow graduate student, Harold Jones, in 1920.\n\nIn 1923, Cover Jones became an associate professor of Psychological Research at the Institute of Educational Research, Teachers' College, Columbia University. Cover Jones conducted her famous study of Peter during her position as associate at Columbia University. After publishing the result from the Peter study in 1924, she completed a doctoral dissertation on the development of early behavior patterns in young children. She went on to work with 365 infants in various areas in New York City and studied the development of early behavior of young children. Jones did not receive attention for her work until the 1960s, when the field of behavior therapy began to coalesce under the leadership of Joseph Wolpe.\n\nIn the summer of 1927, Cover Jones, her husband, and their two daughters moved to California. Barbara, her first daughter, was born in 1922. Leslie, her second daughter, was born three years later in 1925. She then accepted a position as research associate at the Institute for Child Welfare at Berkeley where she became involved in the longitudinal Oakland Growth Study (OGS). A position as Director of Research was offered to Harold, while Cover Jones accepted a position as research associate at the Institute for Child Welfare at the University of California, Berkeley in 1952.\n\nIn 1952, Cover Jones became Assistant Professor of Education at Berkeley. Although she had relevant experience and conducted research, she was not allowed to become a full-time professor due to her husband also being employed at the university. This anti-nepotism rule was very common in this era. The University of California, Berkeley eventually set aside that rule and in 1959 Cover Jones became full professor for one year. During this time, she and her husband Harold produced the first educational television course on developmental psychology.\n\nIn 1960, she became president of the Division of Developmental Psychology of the American Psychological Association (APA). In the same year, she and Harold retired, shortly after which he died of a heart attack.\n\nIn 1986, Jones received the G. Stanley Hall Award from the APA. The G. Stanley Hall Award is awarded to recognize notable contributions to developmental psychology. Some of Jones' contributions include her study of Peter, which laid the foundation for behavior therapy, and her development of desensitization and direct conditioning to overcome fears. Unrelated to psychological research, Cover Jones spent her time being involved in committees related to child welfare and spent a great deal of time and effort on such causes.\n\nWhile attending a speech by leading behavioral psychologist, John B. Watson, Cover Jones became interested in his most famous study, the \"Little Albert experiment\". In this experiment, an infant was classically conditioned to express a fearful response when a white rat was presented along with a loud noise that shocked the child. Cover Jones began to wonder if the techniques used by Watson could be used to make children less fearful of a stimulus, in essence reversing his findings.\n\nThese thoughts led to her most cited work, a study of the removal of a fear of rabbits through conditioning conducted on a three-year-old named Peter at Columbia University. She treated Peter's fear of a white rabbit by \"direct conditioning\", in which a pleasant stimulus (food) was associated with the rabbit. Cover Jones began her experiment with the goal of finding the most effective way to eliminate irrational fears in children. Peter was chosen for the study because in all other aspects of infant life he was considered to be normal except for his fear of rabbits. Peter was not only afraid of rabbits; Cover Jones showed he would also cry when presented with other similar items such as feathers, a fur coat, a fur rug and cotton. She conducted her experiments using a range of different treatments in order to eliminate the fear response in Peter. She described her methods used in the Peter study as \"patient, meticulous and painstaking procedures\", in order to understand what was taking place. This is a method that she learned from her mentor Watson.\n\nShe initiated the study with the rabbit being 12 feet from Peter, and brought the rabbit closer until it was nibbling on Peter's fingers. As the rabbit was gradually brought closer to Peter with the presence of his favorite food (candy), his fear subsided and he eventually was able to touch the rabbit without crying. After curing Peter of his phobia, Cover Jones wrote and published a paper about the experiment titled \"A Laboratory Study of Fear: The Case of Peter (1924)\". Though now considered to be a revolutionary experiment, at the time it was largely dismissed and was not even written up as Cover Jones's dissertation.\nThis study by Cover Jones is considered by some to be a defining landmark in behavioral therapy and was a breakthrough in how behaviorism could be studied and manipulated in the laboratory. Due to the rediscovery of this research in the 1970s, Cover Jones was considered \"the mother of behavioral therapy\" by her friend Wolpe and other colleagues. Additionally, this study was important for the development of the idea and technique of desensitization, now often used to cure phobias by repeatedly exposing a person with a phobia to a series of stimuli that approximate the feared object.\n\nThe Oakland growth study is one of Cover Jones's most influential studies. The Oakland growth study was the third in a series of longitudinal studies from Berkeley College. The first study in the trio was the Berkeley Growth Study, looking at newborns (1928), followed by the Berkeley Guidance study, looking at preschool age children (1928). Both studies were done by looking at children living in Berkeley, California. The Oakland Growth Study (OGS) was led by Cover Jones and her husband. The study began in 1932 in Oakland, California. The Study followed 212 students in the fifth and sixth grade who were born between the years 1920-1921. The participants were studied twice a year until they graduated from high school. The study's primary goal was to understand typical adolescence. They looked at physical abilities, physiological changes, and peer relationships. They were then studied in adulthood at ages 38, 48, and 60 years old. The studies in adulthood consisted of interviews, questionnaires, personality inventories, and health assessments. The final interview of participants took place in 1980, when Cover Jones was 83 years old.\n\nThe results from the Oakland Growth Study allowed Cover Jones to publish 100 papers. Also, due to the well documented data from this study, the data has been reanalyzed and used for other research in the field of child development. The success of the study is considered to be partly due to Cover Jones's strong commitment to the research and her ability to maintain friendships with the study's participants.\n\nAn important finding from the Oakland Growth Study was the long term emotional and behavioral effects of boys and girls who went through puberty at a younger age or at an older age. Additional findings of the Oakland Growth Study were the developmental effects of drinking in adolescents and the effects of economic status.\n\nWithin the field of child development, Jones believed there was some evidence that supported the idea that adolescent children who have started maturing (reaching puberty) at an earlier age were perceived and treated differently by their peers and other adults. In \"Child Development\", the flagship journal of the society of Research and Child Development, published an articles were published by Paul Mussen and Mary Cover Jones (1957, 1958) and that investigated the relationship between physical maturation status and self-concepts in late- and early-maturating adolescent boys and girls, respectively.\n\nPaul Mussen and Mary Cover Jones (1957) conducted a study that investigated the relationship between maturational status and certain aspects of personality during late adolescence. Mussen and Jones believed that there is evidence that supports the notion that within our culture, adults treat boys who have started puberty at an earlier age were treated differently than boys who have started puberty later age because of their physical status. The current study used multiple personality inventories that aimed to uncover aspects of late – and early- maturing boys’ personality to see if there was significant differences among the boys.\n\nOne personality inventory included images of people and objects, and the researchers showed each individual boy, one by one, an image and asked the boy to create a story about what is happening in the image, in hopes that the child would uncover something about himself through the images seen. The results of the study showed that later maturing boys are more likely than early maturing boys to encounter an “unfavorable socio-psychological environment” and that, in turn, can have lifelong implications.\n\nThe following year, Paul Mussen and Mary Cover Jones (1958) replicated the study using late and early maturing adolescent girls. The researchers had different hypotheses for the girls than the boys. The advantageous socio-psychological environments that boys were exposed to for maturing earlier were different for early maturing girls. In our culture, early maturing girls are perceived by adults more negatively than later maturing girls.\n\nThe current study tested the same methods and procedures for the girls as they tested for the boys and the results indicated that early maturing girls were socially disadvantaged until the late maturing girls “caught up” (reached the similar physical status to early maturing girls), which at that point, they no longer perceived any differences.\n\nCover Jones died in Santa Barbara, California on July 22, 1987. She left behind her two daughters—Leslie Alexander, who currently lives in Santa Barbara, and Barbara Coates, who currently lives in Claremont, California—and her six grandchildren. Minutes before she died, Cover Jones told her sister: \"I am still learning about what is important in life\".\n\n\n"}

The programs are sponsored by the National Science Foundation, and are hosted in various universities. REUs tend to be specialized in a particular field of science. There are REUs in many scientific fields such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, geology, biology, psychology, and computer science.\n\nThere are two kinds of REU experiences: REU individual experiences (funded by NSF via their REU Supplements category of grant supplements) and REU sites (funded by NSF via their REU Sites category of grant proposals).\n\nREU sites typically consist of ten undergraduates working in the research program of the host institution either in the US or abroad, for example, CERN. As the program is funded by the NSF, undergraduates must be citizens or permanent residents of the US or its possessions to be eligible for funding. However, some REU sites accept \"self-funder\" international students. Applications are typically due between February and March. The length of the application ranges from a single letter of reference without supporting materials all the way up to something comparable to a college admissions application. The programs generally require between one and three letters of reference, a transcript, 0-2 essays, a letter of interest, a resume, a biographical form, or some combination thereof. Although all eligible students are encouraged to apply, there is an emphasis on including populations underrepresented in science—women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities.\n\nREU individual experiences typically consist of one undergraduate student, or two undergraduate students working together. Sometimes these undergraduates work with a larger research team that includes graduate students. These REU experiences take place at the student's current university, and can last anywhere from a few weeks to an entire year. The application process varies by the particular faculty member who plans to work with these students.\n\nStudents participating in REU sites are generally provided with a modest stipend ($4,000–$6,000 for 10 weeks of work), housing, transportation to and from the site, and often arrangements for food. REU individual experiences pay (stipends or on an hourly basis) at about the same payrate as REU sites.\n\nResearch grants which included Undergraduate research assistants have been funded from the very beginning of the NSF. But in 1958, the NSF established the Undergraduate Research Participation Program, and funding for that program continued until FY 1982, when it was abolished in the Reagan Administration cuts of NSF education funding. A program to enhance research experiences for undergraduates was reestablished in FY 1987 with the title Research Experiences for Undergraduates. One long-running REU-site in the 1990s was Washington University's Computer Science SURA Program.\n\n\n"}

Forster, written in 1957–1958 and published posthumously in \"The Life to Come (and Other Stories)\" in 1972.\n\nThe story begins with a group of children playing on the deck of a boat, which is travelling from India to England. Lionel, who is one of the children playing, is attempting to get one of his friends, Cocoanut (named for his oddly shaped head), to play battle with him. Lionel is one of the five children belonging to Mrs. March, and is aboard the ship because his father had deserted his mother for a native he had met while fighting in a war abroad. Mrs. March makes several comments about how she disapproves of Lionel's friend, Cocoanut. She refers to him as having a touch of the \"tar brush\", or not being entirely of European ancestry. However, she allows them to go ahead and play together for most of the voyage. When she observes that the children are playing in direct sunlight, she sees to it that they play under the awning before they become afflicted with sunstroke. Baby, the youngest of the March children, begins crying as Mrs. March is yelling at the children, so she picks him up to carry him inside. Before she can get inside, however, a young sailor hops out of his cabin and draws a white line around her—which puts her in a state of mind where she cannot escape the circle that surrounds her. Then, Cocoanut appears, screaming that she has been caught. She becomes infuriated with Cocoanut, telling him he is \"a silly idle useless unmanly little boy.”\n\nYears later, Lionel has become a Captain in the British army, and is known for being a war hero, after he was injured in battle. He has grown into a handsome young man, with blonde hair, blue eyes, and broad shoulders. Lionel is aboard a ship to India, where he is to meet up with Isabel, a girl who we assume he is to marry. After boarding the ship, he is made aware that his old friend Cocoanut is also aboard, and had made arrangements for them to share a room together. Lionel seems rather shocked, and quite uncertain about sharing a room with a “half-caste”. But because the ship is already full, and because he acknowledges that his prejudices are tribal, and not personal, he seemingly agrees to room with Cocoanut.\n\nAt first, things seem normal. They unpacked as they talked about old times, joking with each other. And then suddenly things became awkward. As Lionel was sitting on his top bunk, Cocoanut grabbed his leg, and began feeling up until he had reached his groin. Lionel's mind begins to race. He is confused and disgusted as he leaps from his bunk, running out the door. At first he goes to see the Master at Arms, but comes to find out that he is nowhere to be found. He then heads to the Purser's office, demanding that he have his room switched, without giving any reason whatsoever. When the Purser explains that all of the rooms are already full, Lionel furiously marches out of the office. He goes to the front of the ship and watches as he moves farther away from England as he tries to decide what to do. While at the front of the ship he runs into Captain Arbuthnot and his wife, and they form a group known as the Big Eight. After a few drinks and jokes, Lionel begins to loosen up a bit, and complains about having to room with a “wog”. Feeling a little bit better, Lionel decides to go ahead and deal with Cocoanut being his roommate for the voyage, and tries to forget about the strange incident that had happened earlier.\n\nEverything seemed to be going well. \"Order had been reestablished\", as Lionel put it. But Lionel can't help but think back on the night when Cocoanut had made his move, and even wonders what would have happened if he had granted Cocoanuts desires. The ship enters the Mediterranean Sea, and one night, after Lionel returns to his cabin, he is awaited by Cocoanut and a bottle of champagne. After a few drinks, Lionel gave in Cocoanut's seduction, and as they lay in bed together, they talked about their lives. At one point, Cocoanut questions the large scar that Lionel has on his groin area. It turns out that the scar was Lionel's \"battle wound\", which is what ended up making him a war hero. After the story of the battle wound, Lionel continues talking, getting further into deeply personal stories from his younger days. Cocoanut, who we know very little about, doesn't go into much detail about his past. We are able to gather that he is in charge some type of business, although his specific occupation is never revealed. We also know that he has several passports from different countries, which causes us to become sceptical of who Cocoanut really is.\n\nWhile the two men lay entwined in their cabin, we realise that they have become close with one another—Not only on a physical level, but on an emotional level as well. At one point, Lionel says “I’m fonder of you than I know how to say\". Cocoanut's response is that Lionel should have someone to take care of him. The two men ponder being together, but Lionel comes to the realisation that it would be impossible.\n\nSuddenly, Lionel notices the bolt on the door. It had been unlocked the entirety of their lovemaking. Realizing that anyone could have walked into the cabin at any moment, Lionel becomes increasingly distressed. At first he blames himself for being too careless, but then Cocoanut claims that it was partly his fault also, because he knew that the door was unlocked the entire time. Furious with Cocoanut for not mentioning this before, Lionel decides he needs to go out on the deck for a smoke. Realizing the seriousness of what just transpired, Cocoanut says to Lionel as he is walking out the door, \"When you come back you will not be you. And I may not be I.” As he is out on the deck for a smoke, he sees Colonel Arbuthnot sleeping, next to his wife. He thinks about everything which he would lose if anyone were to find out about the scandal with Cocoanut. He was the first born, and felt responsible for maintaining integrity of the family name. Thinking of Isabel, who is waiting on him in India, he decides what happened would not follow him any further. Hearing Lionel, Colonel Arbuthnot wakes up, and apologises to Lionel for having to bunk with a wog. Apparently, it had just been discovered that Cocoanut was not supposed to be on the boat at all. He had sent some \"fat bribes\" out to get himself aboard the ship. After his discussion with the Colonel, Lionel leaves the deck.\n\nReturning to the cabin, Lionel sees Cocoanut in his top bunk. Getting close to Lionel, Cocoanut insists that he kiss him. When Lionel rejects him, Cocoanut decides to go in for the kiss regardless and bites Lionel's forearm. Lionel flashes back to the war and strangles Cocoanut, then kisses his eyelids tenderly, then commits suicide by throwing himself into the ocean. His body is never found.\n\n"}

Founded in the early 1980s as the Islamic Union for the Liberation of Afghanistan (\"Ittehad-e Islami bara-ye Azadi-ye Afghanistan, اتحاد اسلامی برای آزادی افغانستان\"), it was originally an attempt to bring unity amongst Islamist opposition forces in Afghanistan. However, the creation of the new umbrella organization effectively created a split and the organization became a political party of its own. The organization was part of the 'Peshawar Seven', the coalition of mujahedin forces supported by the United States, Pakistan and various Arab states of the Persian Gulf in the war against the PDPA government and Soviet forces. Through the financial aid received from Saudi sources, the organization was able to attract a considerable military following. Arab volunteers fought in the militia forces of the organisation.\n\nAfter the ouster of the PDPA government in April 1992, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar initiated a bombardment campaign against the Islamic State of Afghanistan which had been established by the peace and power-sharing agreement Peshawar Accords. In addition, Saudi Arabia and Iran – as competitors for regional hegemony – supported Afghan militias hostile towards each other. According to Human Rights Watch, \"Iran assisted the Shia Hazara Hezb-i Wahdat forces of Abdul Ali Mazari, as Iran attempted to maximize Wahdat's military power and influence.\" Saudi Arabia supported the Wahhabite Abdul Rasul Sayyaf and his Ittihad-i Islami faction. Conflict between the two militias soon escalated into a full-scale war. Both Ittihad and Wahdat engaged in large-scale kidnapping campaigns against civilians and combatants of the \"other side\". The Islamic State and International Committee of the Red Cross regularly tried to mediate between the two sides, but cease-fires commonly were broken in a matter of days. In early 1993, the Hezb-i Wahdat joined an alliance with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar starting to shell northern Kabul. On February 11, 1993, Ittihad forces took part in the Islamic State's military Afshar operation which had the objective of ending the bombardment on residential areas in northern Kabul conducted by Hezb-i Wadat. After the military operation had ended and successfully forced Wahdat forces from the area, Ittihad forces started to escalate the situation by turning against the civilian population. During and after the operation 70 combatants and civilians were killed. After the operation Ittihad troops under the command of Abdul Rasul Sayyaf kidnapped up to 900 people, 200 of whom were released after ransoms were paid to Ittihad commanders, 700 were never returned by Ittihad forces.\n\nIn 2001, Ittihad's leader Abdul Rasul Sayyaf was suspected of being complicit in the assassination of anti-Taliban leader Ahmad Shah Massoud.\n\nIn 2005, the Ittihad organization was registered as a political party with the Ministry of Justice under its new name. Sayyaf and Ittihad are currently allied to the Karzai government. The party is strongest in the Paghman area and receives most of its support from Pashtuns. Ideologically, the party follows and advocates an Orthodox form of Islam.\n"}

{"id": "1886544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1886544", "title": "Calophyllum inophyllum", "text": "Calophyllum inophyllum\n\nCalophyllum inophyllum is a large evergreen plant, commonly called tamanu, mastwood, beach calophyllum, beautyleaf or . It is native to tropical Asia and Wallacea. Due to its importance as a source of timber for the traditional shipbuilding of large outrigger ships, it has been spread in prehistoric times by the migrations of the Austronesian peoples to the islands of Oceania and Madagascar, along with other members of the genus \"Calophyllum\". It has since been naturalized in regions in the East African coast. It is also a source of the culturally important tamanu oil.\n\n\"Calophyllum inophyllum\" is also known as Alexandrian laurel balltree, beach touriga, Borneo-mahogany, Indian doomba oiltree, Indian-laurel, laurelwood, red poon, satin touriga, and tacamahac-tree. In Island Southeast Asia and Oceania, they are also commonly known as bintangur, bitaog, tamanu, or kamani.\n\n\"Calophyllum inophyllum\" is a low-branching and slow-growing tree with a broad and irregular crown. It usually reaches in height. The flower is wide and occurs in racemose or paniculate inflorescences consisting of four to 15 flowers. Flowering can occur perennially, but usually two distinct flowering periods are observed, in late spring and in late autumn. The fruit (the ballnut) is a round, green drupe measuring in diameter and having a single large seed. When ripe, the fruit is wrinkled and its color varies from yellow to brownish-red.\n\n\"Calophyllum inophyllum\" is native to Africa in: Comoros; Kenya; Madagascar; Mauritius; Mozambique; Seychelles; Tanzania (including Pemba Island of the Zanzibar Archipelago); south, southeast and east Asia in: Bangladesh; Cambodia; China (on Hainan); southern India; Andaman and Nicobar Islands Indonesia; Japan (Ryukyu Islands); Malaysia; Myanmar; Papua New Guinea; the Philippines; Sri Lanka; Taiwan; Thailand; Vietnam; the northwestern, southwestern and south central Pacific Region in: the Cook Islands; Fiji; French Polynesia (Marquesas and Society Islands); Guam; the Marshall Islands; Micronesia; the Northern Mariana Islands; Palau; and Samoa; and in Australia in: Northern Territory and Queensland.\n\nNow, it is widely cultivated in all tropical regions of the world. Because of its decorative leaves, fragrant flowers, and spreading crown, it is best known as an ornamental plant.\n\nThis tree often grows in coastal regions, as well as nearby lowland forests. However, it has also been cultivated successfully in inland areas at moderate altitudes. It tolerates varied kinds of soil, coastal sand, clay, or even degraded soil.\n\nMastwood is notable for its ability to grow to massive sizes in sandy or rocky beaches of island and coastal habitats, as well as its habit of sending out arching large trunks over the water where its seeds are dispersed via the currents. Due to these characters, mastwood are of particular importance to traditional shipbuilding of the larger Austronesian outrigger ships and were carried with them as they migrated to Oceania and Madagascar. Other species of the genus \"Calophyllum\" were also used similarly, like \"Calophyllum soulattri\", \"Calophyllum peekelii\", and \"Calophyllum goniocarpum\". They were comparable in importance to how oaks were in European shipbuilding and timber industries. \n\nVarious parts of the mastwood were integral to the manufacture of outrigger canoes among various Austronesian peoples. The large curving limbs were commonly carved into the dugout canoe that formed the keel of the Austronesian outriggers ships. The strakes, which are attached to the keel by the uniquely Austronesian technique of \"sewing\" them with a combination of dowels and lashed lugs instead of nails, can also be made from mastwood, but it is more commonly made from other \"softer\" timber species like \"Artocarpus\". Other pieces became masts, outrigger floats, and outrigger spars. Smaller curving limbs can also be carved into the ribs of the boat. \n\nIn many parts of Polynesia, mastwood groves planted in \"marae\" were considered sacred and abodes of spirits. Mastwood were also carved into religious objects like \"tiki\". They are also commonly mentioned in the chants and folklore of Polynesia.\n\nIn Australia, the 1889 book \"The Useful Native Plants of Australia\" records \"During a debate on the Pearl Fisheries Bill in the Queensland Assembly, a clause was specially inserted to protect trees of this species at Thursday Island. A fine of £10 is inflicted on any person who cuts down or injures this or a cocoa-nut tree, or any other tree bearing edible fruit. This clause is, of course, in the interest of the aboriginals.\".\n\nAside from shipbuilding, tamanu oil extracted from the fruit kernels were important in Polynesian culture. The oils, as well as poultices made from leaves and flowers, are also commonly used for traditional medicine. The leaves contain compounds that are poisonous to fish and can be used as fish poison. The sap of the tree is poisonous and is used to make poison arrows in Samoa. The mature fruit is poisonous enough to use as rat bait.\n\nThe seeds yield a thick, dark green tamanu oil for medicinal use or hair grease. The nuts are dried before cracking, after which the oil-laden kernel is removed and further dried. The first neoflavone isolated from natural sources (1951) was calophyllolide from \"C. inophyllum\" seeds.\n\nThe Mavilan, a Tulu-speaking tribe in north Kerala in India, use the bark to make a powder that they mix with water and apply it to plants affected by a type of plant disease caused by water that they call \"neeru vembu\".\n\nThe fatty acid methyl esters derived from \"C. inophyllum\" seed oil meets the major biodiesel requirements in the United States (ASTM D 6751), and European Union (EN 14214). The average oil yield is 11.7 kg-oil/tree or 4680 kg-oil/hectare. In the northwest coastal areas of Luzon island in Philippines, the oil was used for night lamps. This widespread use started to decline when kerosene became available, and later on electricity. It was also used as fuel to generate electricity to provide power for radios during World War II.\n\n\n"}

Over a career spanning 50 years, he served under Louis XV and Louis XVI and took part in 34 campaigns. He fought in the Seven Years' War and in the Naval battles of the American Revolutionary War, earning the ranks of Commandeur in the Order of Saint Louis in 1780, and of Grand Cross in 1784. He died during the French Revolution.\n\nLa Motte-Picquet joined the Gardes de la Marine in Brest on 11 July 1735, then aged 15. Two years later, he served on the frigate \"Vénus\" in a campaign against the Barbary corsairs of Salé. On 1 January 1743, he rose to \"sous-brigadier des gardes de la marine\", and then to \"aide d'artillerie\" on 10 December, after serving in two campaigns in the English Channel and off Ireland on \"Mercure\", under Dubois de La Motte, in a squadron under comte de Roquefeuil.\n\nIn January 1745, during the War of the Austrian Succession, after having conducted nine campaigns off Morocco, in the Baltic Sea and in the Caribbean, he transferred on the frigate \"Renommée\", under Captain Guy François de Kersaint. On 6 February 1745, \"Renommée\" departed Brest to ferry despatches to Louisbourg, then blockaded by the British. Taking advantage of the fog and the ice that hindered the British cruisers, the frigate managed to anchor at Baie des Castors, where she still had to fight off several smaller British ships.\n\nOn 16 June 1746, on her third trip from Canada, \"Renommée\" met a British squadron under Admiral George Anson. In the ensuing battle, Kersaint was gravely wounded and La Motte-Picquet took command, managing to escape to Port-Louis. La Motte-Picquet himself had his cheek cut away by a cannonball. \n\nOn 24 February 1784, La Motte-Picquet departed Brest as first officer on the 24-gun frigate \"Cumberland\", under Captain Mézédern, bound for Ile de France and Ile Bourbon. After calling A Coruña, \"Cumberland\" encountered a British 36-gun frigate, leading to an inconclusive battle where she lost 25 killed or wounded. After a 122-day travel, \"Cumberland\" reached Bourbon, and then Ile de France. From there, she departed for a cruise off India on 20 October 1748..\n\nPeace being restored in October 1748 with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, La Motte-Picquet cruised in the Caribbean, in the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean. In 1754, he rose to the rank of Lieutenant de Vaisseau.\n\nIn 1755, La Motte-Picquet earned his first command. In October 1756, he was made a Knight in the Order of Saint-Louis.\n\nIn 1757, La Motte-Picquet was part of the staff of the 74-gun \"Diadème\", under Captain Rosily-Méros, part of the squadron under Dubois de La Motte tasked to challenge the British off Québec. In 1758, he fought off Fort de Portzic in Brest Roads, and had to report his actions before the Secretary of State for the Navy Arnouville..\n\nIn 1760, he was on convoy escort duty between Brest and Rochefort. In 1762, he was promoted to Captain and appointed to \"Diadème\".\n\nAfter the Peace of Paris in 1763, La Motte-Picquet served in squadrons under Admiral d'Orvilliers and Duchaffaut. In September 1763, he was given command of the 32-gun frigate \"Malicieuse\" to undertake a 6-month cruise off Canada.\n\nIn the next years, he conducted several raids against the Barbary corsairs of Salé. In 1772, commanding the 16-gun corvette \"Cerf-Volant\", he distinguished himself in a training squadron under Orvilliers.\n\nIn 1776, he was given command of the 64-gun ship of the line \"Solitaire\", with Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans as a notable participant.\n\nIn June 1777, Lamotte-Picquet commanded the 74-gun \"Robuste\". On 14 February 1778, he fired a nine-gun salute for USS \"Ranger\", marking the first time a foreign warship recognised the US flag.\n\nIn 1778, as a Squadron Commander, he took part in the Battle of Ouessant on the \"Saint-Esprit\", and then cruised the English seas. During one month, he captured thirteen ships.\n\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, Picquet de la Motte distinguished himself as a member of Admiral d'Estaing's squadron in Martinique, during the Battle of Grenada, and the Siege of Savannah.\nOn 18 December 1779, he attacked a British squadron under the command of Admiral Hyde Parker that was attempting to blockade a French convoy off Martinique; in the ensuing Battle of Martinique, La Motte-Picquet so impressed Hyde Parker that he sent him a letter of congratulation:\nIn 1781, as commander of a nine-vessel squadron that included three frigates, Picquet de la Motte intercepted the fleet of Admiral Rodney en route from St. Eustatius which the British had captured in February 1781. Picquet de la Motte captured 26 British ships, along with Rodney's plunder in the amount of 5 million sterling. Soon afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant General of the Naval Armies.\n\nAfter fifty-two years of service and severe attacks of gout in his later years, La Motte-Piquet died on 11 June 1791 in Brest, aged 70. He was buried in the local graveyard.\n\nFive ships of the French Navy have been named \"La Motte-Picquet\" in his honour, the most recent being the F70-Type frigate \"Lamotte-Picquet\", still in service as of 2020. \n\nThere is a street in the 7th arrondissement of Paris named after him, l'Avenue de la Motte-Picquet. The Paris metro station La Motte-Picquet – Grenelle is located on the avenue, on the border of the 7th and 15th arrondissements of Paris.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1886571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1886571", "title": "Christian vegetarianism", "text": "Christian vegetarianism\n\nChristian vegetarianism is the practice of keeping to a vegetarian lifestyle for reasons connected to or derived from the Christian faith. The three primary reasons are spiritual, nutritional, and ethical. The ethical reasons may include a concern for God's creation or a concern for animal welfare (or both). Likewise, Christian veganism is the abstaining from the use of all animal products for reasons connected to or derived from the Christian faith.\n\nVegetarianism was widespread in the early Church, among both the clergy and laity.\n\nSome religious orders of various Christian Churches practice strict Christian vegetarianism, including the Franciscans, Trappists, Trappistines, Carthusians and Cistercians. Various Church leaders have recommended vegetarianism, including John Wesley (founder of the Methodist Church), William and Catherine Booth (founders of The Salvation Army), William Cowherd from the Bible Christian Church and Ellen G. White from the Seventh-day Adventists. Cowherd, who founded the Bible Christian Church in 1809, helped to establish the world's first Vegetarian Society in 1847.\n\nOrganizations such as the Christian Vegetarian Association (CVA) actively work to promote the concept.\n\nAdditionally, many Christians may choose to practice vegetarianism as their Lenten sacrifice during the penetential season of Lent.\n\nChristian vegetarianism has not been a common dietary choice throughout Church history. Some have argued, however, that \"there is a long-standing tradition of vegetarianism in Christian history.\" The two most prominent forms are a spirituality-based vegetarianism (where vegetarianism is adopted as an ascetic practice, or as a way of opposing the sin of gluttony, in the hope it will draw the person to God) and an ethically-based vegetarianism (where it is adopted for ethical reasons; for example, those to do with the treatment of non-human animals). Christian ethical vegetarianism (or veganism) usually carries with it a commitment to the normative claim that (at least some) Christians \"should be\" vegetarians. For this reason, Christian ethical vegetarians often give a scriptural justification for their position. While there are biblical passages which provide support for ethical vegetarianism, there are also passages which seem to imply that eating animals is morally permissible.\n\nOne of the most important passages for Christian vegetarians is the first creation narrative in the book of Genesis. After creating humans, God addresses them in chapter 1, verses 29–30 as follows:\n\nGod said, “See, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food. And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so.\n\nIn this passage, God prescribes a plant-based diet not just for humans, but for all land-based non-human animals. Christian vegetarians and vegans point out that it was this creation—where all creatures ate plants—that God then declared \"very good\" in verse 31. Moreover, that God's initial creation was a vegan creation suggests that this is how God intended all his creatures to live. This idea—that God intended for all his creatures to eat plants—is sometimes further supported by noting that the vision of the Peaceable Kingdom found in Isaiah suggests that God will one day restore creation to such a state. Isaiah 11:6–9 reads:\n\nThe wolf shall live with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid, the calf and the lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them. The cow and the bear shall graze, their young shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. The nursing child shall play over the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put its hand on the adder’s den. They will not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain; for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.\n\nSome Christian vegetarians have suggested that this eschatological view provides reasons to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet here and now. Moreover, the point has often been made that the \"dominion\" which humans are given over the non-human animals in Genesis 1:26–28 must be understood in light of Genesis 1:29–30 which decrees a plant-based diet for all creatures. Genesis 1:26–28 has, it is acknowledged by Christian vegetarians, often been used to justify the eating of animals. But this is a mistake, they suggest. Once it is recognized that humans are given dominion over creation, and that in the very next verse humans are prescribed a plant-based diet, it will become apparent that \"dominion\" should be understood in terms of servant-hood: humans are called to rule creation in the sense of caring for it and seeking its flourishing, just as a good Sovereign would seek the flourishing of his or her realm. In a survey of the scholarly literature on the relevant Hebrew terms, Carol J. Adams lists \"governing\", \"ruling\", \"shepherding\", \"caring-for\", \"nurturing\", and \"leading about\" as potential ways of understanding \"dominion\", and notes that the common characteristic of these concepts \"is their benignity\".\n\nThe opening chapters of Genesis are, of course, only the beginning of the biblical story. And just as there are passages which can be cited in support of a Christian vegetarianism or veganism, so there are passages which suggest that eating animals is morally permissible. The most problematic passages for Christian vegetarians are those which include an explicit permission to eat animals. Genesis 9:3-4 is the first such example. In this verse, God tells Noah and his family that animals will now be their food, although they are not to eat animal flesh which contains blood. This new situation - that of humans eating animals - is then taken largely for granted in much of the biblical narrative. records God giving the Israelites rules about what types of meat may be eaten, which implies that certain meats were acceptable. During the Exodus out of Egypt, God commanded that all of the Israelites to slaughter a lamb and eat it, and instituted the Passover as a lasting tradition to remember God's saving them.\n\nSome Jewish and Christian vegetarians have attempted to minimize the importance of these passages. It has been suggested, for example, that God's permitting Noah and his family to eat meat was only ever intended as a temporary permission, and was given because all the plants had been destroyed as a result of the flood. Others interpret the permission given to Noah and his family in Genesis 9:3–4, not as a free pass to kill animals for food because \"no matter what you do you can never remove all the blood from the flesh of a slaughtered animal\", but as an invitation to scavenge for and eat dead animals if any are found. These approaches are put under pressure, however, with the sheer number of passages which appear to presuppose the legitimacy of eating animals, and the normalcy with which meat eating is treated.\n\nAnother approach to these texts is to suggest that God reluctantly permitted the eating of animals due to human sinfulness. In other words, God permitted humans to eat non-human animals as a concession to the Fallen state of humanity. Richard Young raises the possibility that both the introduction of animals into the human diet, and the use of animals in religious sacrifices, were concessions to a Fallen humanity that were used to deal with humanity where it was at. This approach allows the Christian vegetarian or vegan to take the entire biblical witness seriously, while also holding that God's preference is for a peace and shalom throughout creation.\n\nOther passages of relevance to the practice of vegetarianism include Numbers 11, where the Israelites tired of manna, a food of which \"The Rabbis of the Talmud held that […] had whatever taste and flavor the eater desired at the time of eating\" and which probably was not an animal product. Manna was given to the Israelites by God, but they complained about it and wanted meat instead. They were condemned for this, although God relented and gave them meat, which then made them ill. Because of their lust, the place where the incident happened became known as \"Kibroth Hattaavah\".\n\nA donkey temporarily given the ability to speak showed Balaam more than signs of sentience.\n\nSome people believe that the Book of Daniel also specifically promotes veganism as empowering. Daniel specifically refuses the king's \"meat\" (\"paṯbaḡ\", Strong's #5698) and instead requests vegetables (\"zērōʿîm\", Strong's #2235). However, current common theology argues that in this instance Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah are rejecting food that is considered to be unholy by their faith (eating food that had been sacrificed to pagan gods), and not meat \"per se\", despite that \"at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat\".\n\nPhilo says that the Essenes, \"being more scrupulous than any in the worship of God […] do not sacrifice animals […], but hold it right to dedicate their own hearts as a worthy offering\". They maintained that the sacrifices \"polluted\" the Temple.\n\nThe Christian Vegetarian Association of the UK claims that the word \"meat\" is not used in any one instance in the authorized version of either the Old or New Testament as relating only to animal food (e.g. \"flesh\"). The CVA states that when the first English translations of the Bible were created, the word for \"meat\" meant food in general. When any particular kind of food was designated, it was referred to as meal, flour or grain.\n\nAccording to the CVS, examples of New Testament words that were translated as \"meat\" include: broma (\"that which is eaten\"/usage: 16 times ); brosimos (\"eatable\"/usage: 1 time); brosis (\"act of eating; that which is eaten, food; food of the souls/usage: 7 times); prosphagion (\"anything eaten with bread; spoken of fish boiled or broiled\"/usage: 1 time); sitometron (\"a measured portion of grain or food\"/usage: 1 time); trapeza (\"a table on which food is placed, an eating place\"/usage: 1 time); trophe (\"food, nourishment\"/usage: 13 times); phago (\"to eat, to take food, eat a meal, devour, consume\"/usage: 3 times).\n\nChristian vegetarians and vegans often appeal to the ethic that Jesus embodied, and called people to emulate, in making their case for a distinctively Christian vegetarianism. To begin with, Jesus inaugurated the Kingdom of God, but his Kingdom didn't involve the exercise of power as humans tend to think of it. As Andrew Linzey argues, Christ's power is \"the power to serve\". Human beings are called to have the same mind that was found in Jesus Christ, i.e., the mind to exercise power in service. And by considering Jesus's life, it is possible to get an idea of what that service means. Sarah Withrow King writes that Jesus \"loved the unlovable. In first-century Palestine, the unlovable were women, children, sick people, poor people, Roman soldiers, zealots, lepers, the blind, the outcast\", and so on. But today, the unlovable should include those non-human animals who are farmed for food in systems which preclude their flourishing and result in their (often painful) deaths.\n\nChristian vegetarians also stress the importance Jesus laid on \"peace\" and \"inclusion\". These and other aspects of Jesus's attitudes towards others are used to extract ethical principles which, according to Christian vegetarians and vegans, lead one to a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle. Sarah Withrow King summarizes the point like this:\nAware of the suffering and pain experienced by animals raised and killed for food, with a knowledge of the immense waste of natural resources and subsequent impact on both our fellow humans and the rest of creation, and acknowledging that flesh is not a dietary necessity for the vast majority of Western humans, why would we continue to participate in a system that dishonors God’s creation and perpetuates violence on a truly phenomenal scale?\n\nThere are several passages that appear to count against the idea that vegetarianism or veganism could be mandatory for Christians. Some of the most challenging are those passages which speak of Jesus eating fish, and Jesus telling his disciples where to catch fish, before cooking it for them to eat.\n\nJesus's eating of fish is supposed to cause a problem for Christian ethical vegetarians and vegans because, if Jesus ate fish, then, since Jesus was without sin, eating fish cannot be wrong. And therefore, so the argument goes, it must be permissible for Jesus's followers to eat fish. The same reasoning could be used to justify the eating of any meats that Jesus ate, if it is assumed that he did indeed eat other kinds of meat (the Bible does not explicitly say Jesus ate any meat other than fish, and some writers have made much of the fact that no lamb is mentioned at the Last Supper.)\n\nAlthough it is a question commonly posed to Christian vegetarians, Jesus's eating of fish (and potentially other meat) does not straightforwardly justify the eating of meat today. Many Christians in the West, for example, would consider the eating of cats and dogs morally wrong. Moreover, they would not change their judgement if it were claimed that the cats and dogs had \"had a good life\", or had been treated well prior to being slaughtered. But any Christian who thinks that eating a cat or a dog is wrong, cannot appeal to Jesus's eating of fish (and possibly other meat) as providing a blanket permission to eat meat. The same point can be made by appealing to the fact that many meat-eating Christians think that foods such as foie gras or veal should not be eaten because their production involves great cruelty. Foie gras, for example, is produced by over-feeding—often by force-feeding—ducks and geese so that their livers become artificially enlarged beyond their natural size. This controversial practice is illegal in the UK, Germany, and many other countries in Europe, as well as in Argentina, Australia, Israel, and several US states. Any Christian who agrees that the production and eating of foie gras is immoral cannot at the same time appeal to Jesus's eating of fish (possibly other meat) as a blanket permission to eat any meat whatever. The point can be put like this: the fact that Jesus ate fish (and possibly other meat) shows that, \"in some circumstances\", it is \"sometimes\" permissible to eat \"some\" meats. But Jesus's eating of fish (possibly meat) \"doesn't show\" that eating meat is always justified. At this point in the debate, Christian vegetarians and vegans are likely to point to practices in the modern, industrialized farming system, which they think make the eating of meat produced in such farms morally problematic—practices such as, to give just one example, the mass killing of day-old male chicks from laying hens.\n\nSome Christian vegetarians and vegans have appealed to biblical scholarship to argue that biblical passages often need nuanced interpretation, and to guard against a wooden literalism. Andy Alexis-Baker, for example, points to the work of Gerald O'Collins, SJ, who suggests that differences between the way Luke describes this appearance in Luke 24:41–43 and in Acts 1, and a tension between Luke 24:41–43 and 1 Corinthians 6, preclude us from reading this verse literally. This serves to caution readers of the Bible about drawing ethical conclusions from such biblical passages too quickly.\n\nOthers have explained this passage by the appealing to a so-called \"synoptic principle\".\n\nIn the tenth chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, there is an account of a vision given to the Apostle Peter. In this vision, Peter is shown a large sheet being lowered from heaven by its four corners. The sheet is said to contain animals of all kinds, and Peter then hears a voice (which he interprets as a command from God) saying, \"Get up, Peter; kill and eat\". Peter refuses, and the voice says \"What God has made clean, you must not call profane\".\n\nMany see this passage as teaching that it is permissible for Christians to eat any creatures, and that therefore while it is still permissible for Christians to follow a vegetarian or vegan diet if they wish, such a diet cannot be obligatory for any Christians.\n\nChristian vegetarians and vegans put forward another interpretation. To understand the meaning of Peter's vision, it is necessary to read Acts chapter 10 in its entirety. The opening of the chapter recounts how a Roman Centurion named Cornelius, a devout God-fearing Gentile, himself had a vision in which he is instructed to send someone to Peter. Cornelius obeys. The text then recounts how the next day Peter became hungry while he was praying. While waiting for his food, he fell into a trance and it is at this point that he receives the aforementioned vision.\n\nWhile Peter is puzzling over the meaning of the vision, the men that Cornelius sent to Peter arrive at the house where Peter is staying. Peter is instructed to go with them, and he does so. This is significant because Peter was a Jew, and it was against the Jewish law for Jews to associate with Gentiles. And so, what the text seems to be saying is that the vision Peter received about eating unclean animals was actually about the message of the Gospel and how it was for everyone, even \"unclean\" Gentiles. The text appears to report Peter himself as recognizing this. After Cornelius tells Peter of the vision that he received, and how he sent men to find Peter as a result of the angel's message to him, Peter exclaims: \"I truly understand that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.\"\n\nChristian vegetarians and vegans, in other words, tend to say that this passage is not about which animals one may or may not eat, but it is about who the Gospel is for, as Laura Hobgood-Oster puts it:\nThe vision, it seems, is not about eating animals; rather it is about extending hospitality to all humans. While animals in sacred texts are often real animals and should be considered as such, in this particular case it seems that in Peter’s vision animals symbolized human categories that exclude other humans from community.\nSarah Withrow King writes that God uses this vision to remind Peter that he is to \"remove barriers of fellowship and to reconcile with those from whom we have been separated in order to further the reign of God on earth... the vision is one of radical inclusion\". This interpretation is supported by (1) noting that there is no better way to get the attention of a hungry person than to use a vision involving food, and (2) there is no mention in the passage of what food is actually served, so we cannot assume that the vision is telling Peter that he must eat the unclean food when he visits Cornelius's house.\n\nJohn Vujicic agrees with the interpretation above and supports it with two further observations. First, he notes that after receiving the vision, Peter did not eat anything. But, Vujicic writes, \"In the sheet were also so called CLEAN animals. Peter could have at least selected some sheep or cattle and killed but he didn’t.\" Second, according to Vujicic, the reason Peter didn't simply take up and eat a \"clean\" animal was because Peter was in fact a vegetarian. Peter is reported as describing himself as a vegetarian in the Clementine Homilies. This last point will be unconvincing to many Christians, because the Clementine Homilies are not canonical literature.\n\nIn Mark 7:14-15, Jesus says the following: \"‘Listen to me, all of you, and understand: there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile, but the things that come out are what defile.’\". His disciples fail to understand, so once they are alone with Jesus, they ask him about it, and Jesus elaborates as follows: \"Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile, since it enters, not the heart but the stomach, and goes out into the sewer? ... It is what comes out of a person that defiles. For it is from within, from the human heart, that evil intentions come.\" In the middle of this speech, the author of the Gospel of Mark writes explicitly that in saying these things, Jesus \"declared all foods clean\".\n\nIn this passage, Jesus is teaching that his followers do not need to obey the Jewish dietary laws. The context also makes clear that Jesus's focus is on the status of the human heart, which he sees as the source of evil intentions, and not the mere observing of rules. In the opening verses of Mark chapter 7, Jesus is challenged by the \"Pharisees and scribes\" who \"live according to the tradition of the elders\". Jesus's reply is that following religious rules and traditions is often done as a way of avoiding following God and God's commandments. Jesus's teaching that all foods were now clean was a continuation of this: what matters is the human heart, not external observance to religious rules.\n\nSome Christians and Christian groups suggest that Jesus's teaching in Mark 7 demonstrates that Christians can eat whatever they want, that dietary choices are a matter of \"Christian liberty\", and that therefore vegetarianism or veganism could never be obligatory for Christians.\n\nChristian vegetarians and vegans counter, however, that the point of Jesus's teaching in Mark 7 is that his followers should concern themselves with the status of their heart which \"informs our relationship with God, with each other, and the world\". At most, we could deduce that when Jesus declared all foods clean, he was implicitly accepting the permissibility \"for his immediate audience\" of eating \"the meat that was available to them in Israel in the first-century\". But it doesn't follow from this that all Christians everywhere can eat whatever they like.\n\nChristian vegetarians and vegans might make the point described above in the discussion of Luke 24, namely, that few Christians in the West think it is okay to eat cats, dogs, or foods such as foie gras. If, however, it is morally problematic to eat cats, dogs or foie gras, then Jesus's declaring all foods clean doesn't make eating animals purely a matter of \"Christian liberty\", if by that is meant that each person can decide for him- or herself what to eat. Quite the opposite appears to be true. If Jesus's point in this passage was that the source of human evil comes from the intentions within the human heart, then Jesus's followers should seek to avoid behaviors and practices which involve intentionally inflicting cruelty on the non-human animals that God has created.\n\nVegetarianism appears to have been a point of contention within some early Christian circles, notably in Rome. Within the Bible's New Testament, the Apostle Paul states that people of \"weak faith\" \"eat only vegetables\", although he also warns both meat-eaters and vegetarians to \"stop passing judgment on one another\" when it comes to food in verse 13 and \"[It is] good neither to eat flesh\" in verse 21. Paul also said, \"The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. They […] order […] to abstain from certain foods\". According to the Christian Vegetarian Association, Paul was not referring to vegetarianism, which they say was not an issue in those times, but to the practice of not eating meat from the meat market because of fear that (like the above issue involving Daniel) it was sacrificed to an idol. \"Wherefore, if meat [\"brōma\", Strong's #1033, 'anything used as food'] make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.\"\n\nIn the 4th Century some Jewish Christian groups maintained that Jesus was himself a vegetarian. Epiphanius quotes the Gospel of the Ebionites where Jesus has a confrontation with the high priest. Jesus chastises the leadership saying, \"I am come to end the sacrifices and feasts of blood; and if ye cease not offering and eating of flesh and blood, the wrath of God shall not cease from you; even as it came to your fathers in the wilderness, who lusted for flesh, and did sate to their content, and were filled with rottenness, and the plague consumed them.\"\n\nAccording to Lightfoot, \"the Christianized Essennes […] condemned the slaughter of victims on grounds very different from those alleged in the Epistle of Hebrews, not because they have been superseded by the Atonement, but because they are in their very nature repulsive to God; not because they have ceased to be right, but because they never were right from the beginning\".\n\nOther early Christian historical documents observe that many influential Christians during the formative centuries of Christianity were vegetarian, though certainly not all. The \"Clementine homilies\", a second-century work purportedly based on the teachings of the Apostle Peter, states, \"The unnatural eating of flesh meats is as polluting as the heathen worship of devils, with its sacrifices and its impure feasts, through participation in it a man becomes a fellow eater with devils.\"\n\nAlthough early Christian vegetarianism appears to have been downplayed in favor of more \"modern\" Christian culture, the practice of vegetarianism appears to have been very widespread in early Christianity, both in the leadership and among the laity. Origen's work \"Contra Celsum\" quotes Celsus commenting vegetarian practices among Christians he had contact with. Although not vegetarian himself and vehemently against the idea that Christians must be vegetarians, Augustine nevertheless wrote that those Christians who \"abstain both from flesh and from wine\" are \"without number\".\n\nThe Bible Christian Church founded by Reverend William Cowherd in 1809 followed a vegetarian diet. Cowherd was one of the philosophical forerunners of the Vegetarian Society. Cowherd encouraged members to abstain from eating of meat as a form of temperance. Cowherd emphasized that vegetarianism was good for health, whilst eating meat was unnatural and likely to cause aggression. Later he is reputed to have said \"If God had meant us to eat meat, then it would have come to us in edible form [as is the ripened fruit].\"\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventists present a health message that recommends vegetarianism and expects abstinence from pork, shellfish and other foods proscribed as \"unclean\" in Leviticus. A number of the founders of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, including Joseph Bates and Ellen White adopted a vegetarian diet during the nineteenth century, and Ellen White reportedly received visions regarding the health benefits of a vegetarian diet. More recently, members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in California have been involved in research into longevity due to their healthy lifestyle, which includes maintaining a vegetarian diet. This research has been included within a \"National Geographic\" article. Another denomination with common origin, the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement recommends vegetarianism as a part of fellowship, with many of its members being practicing vegans as well. Typically, however, these sabbatarian pro-vegetarian Christian fellowships do not \"require vegetarianism as a test of fellowship.\"\n\nThe Word of Wisdom is a dietary law given to adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement (also known as Mormonism), which states that \"flesh also of beasts and of fowls of the air... are to be used sparingly,\" and that \"it is pleasing unto [God] that they should not be used, only in times of winter, or of cold, or famine\". Unlike injunctions against tobacco and alcohol, compliance with this part of the Doctrine and Covenants has never been made mandatory by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the largest Latter Day Saint denomination. Many LDS Church leaders have expressed their views on the subject of meat, but since Joseph F. Smith became church president in 1901, emphasis on refraining from meat has largely been dropped. An official church publication states, \"[m]odern methods of refrigeration now make it possible to preserve meat in any season\". As recently as 2012, official church spokesperson Michael Otterson stated \"the church has also encouraged limiting meat consumption in favor of grains, fruits and vegetables.\" Of note is that the LDS Church owns and operates Deseret Ranches in central Florida, which is one of the largest cow-calf operations in the United States.\n\nSome members of the Religious Society of Friends (also known as Quakers) practice vegetarianism or veganism as a reflection of the Peace Testimony, extending non-violence towards animals. Historically, the early vegetarian movement had many Quaker promoters. Some Ranter groups - non-conformist Christian groups that existed in 17th-century England - were vegetarian.\n\nRoman Catholic monastic orders such as the Carthusians and Cistercians follow a strict vegetarian diet. Carmelites and others following the Rule of St. Albert also maintain a vegetarian diet, although the old and sick are permitted to eat meat according to this rule of life.\n\nThe Liberal Catholic Movement traditionally had many people who were vegetarians and still have. \n\nChristian anarchists, such as Leo Tolstoy, Ammon Hennacy, and Théodore Monod, extend the Christian principles of compassion and nonviolence through following a vegetarian diet.\n\nThe Christian Vegetarian Association (CVA) is an international, non-denominational Christian vegetarian organization that promotes responsible stewardship of God's creation through plant-based eating. The CVA produced the 2006 film \"Honoring God’s Creation\".\n\nSarx is a UK-based organization which aims to \"empower Christians to champion the cause of animals and live peacefully with all God’s creatures\". Sarx publishes interviews with Christian vegans and vegetarians on its website, and provides people to speak at Churches in the UK on topics such as Christianity and veganism, animal welfare and faith, creation and animals.\n\nCreatureKind is an organization which exists \"to encourage Christians to recognize faith-based reasons for caring about the well-being of fellow animal creatures used for food, and to take practical action in response\". It was founded by David Clough, Professor of Theological Ethics at the University of Chester, and is directed by Clough and Sarah Withrow King, an American author and deputy directory of the Sider Center at Eastern University. CreatureKind produces a course for churches to do which facilitates church groups to think through how Christians should respond to and treat animals.\n\nCatholic Concern for Animals (CCA) is a charity which calls Catholics \"to cherish and care for all of [God's] creation\". CCA has for \"many years\" promoted a vegetarian/vegan diet as a way of caring for creation, in particular animals.\n\nThe group Evangelicals for Social Action have suggested that a vegan diet is a way of demonstrating Christian love and compassion to farmed animals, and argue in particular that this is what a consistently pro-life ethic looks like.\n\nChristian Vegetarians and Vegans UK is an organization seeking to promote a vegetarian/vegan lifestyle in the Church in the UK.\n\nDuring Lent some Christian communities, such as Orthodox Christians in the Middle East, undertake partial fasting eating only one light meal per day. For strict Greek Orthodox Christians and Copts, all meals during this 40-day period are prepared without animal products and are essentially vegan. Unlike veganism, however, abstaining from animal products during Lent is intended to be only temporary and not a permanent way of life.\n\nEastern Orthodox laity traditionally abstains from animal products on Wednesdays (because, according to Christian tradition, Judas betrayed Jesus on the Wednesday prior to the Crucifixion of Jesus) and Fridays (because Jesus is thought to have been crucified on the subsequent Friday), as well as during the four major fasting periods of the year: Great Lent, the Apostles' Fast, the Dormition Fast and the Nativity Fast. Catholic laity traditionally abstain from animal flesh on Fridays and through the Lenten season leading up to Easter (sometimes being required to do so by law, see fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church), some also, as a matter of private piety, observe Wednesday abstinence. \"Fish\" is not considered proper meat in any case (see pescetarianism, though the Eastern Orthodox allow fish only on days on which the fasting is lessened but meat still not allowed). For these practices, \"animal rights\" are no motivation and positive environmental or individual health effects only a surplus benefit; the actual reason is to practice mortification and some marginal asceticism.\n\nOriental Orthodox, Eastern Orthodox, and Eastern Catholic monastics abstain from meat year-round, and many abstain from dairy and seafood as well. Through obedience to the Orthodox Church and its ascetic practices, the Orthodox Christian seeks to rid himself or herself of the \"passions\", or the disposition to sin.\n\nAccording to Canon Law, Roman Catholics are required to abstain from meat (defined as all animal flesh and organs, excluding water animals) on Ash Wednesday and all Fridays of Lent including Good Friday. Ash Wednesday and Good Friday are also fast days for Catholics ages 18 to 60, in which one main meal and two half-meals are eaten, with no snacking. Canon Law also obliges Catholics to abstain from meat on the Fridays of the year outside of Lent (excluding certain holy days) unless, with the permission of the local conference of bishops, another penitential act is substituted. Exceptions are allowed for health and necessity like manual labor and not causing offense when being a guest. The restrictions on eating meat on these days is solely as an act of penance and not because of a religious objection to eating meat. In 1966, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops the conference of bishops has made substitution of a different penitential or charitable act an option for ordinary Fridays in their territory. After previous abolition, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales restored the meatless ordinary Friday requirement for their territory effective September, 2011. A popular misconception is that Pope Gregory I (who ruled from 590 to 604, and who is also a canonized saint) declared that rabbits were not meat. This is apparently a corruption of a manuscript in which Saint Gregory of Tours described one person (who was also ill and might not have been Catholic) eating a rabbit fetus during Lent. The rules are widely ignored; a 2016 survey found that only 62% of U.S. Catholics said they avoid meat on Fridays during Lent.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1886574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1886574", "title": "Bridgeton, Indiana", "text": "Bridgeton, Indiana\n\nBridgeton is an unincorporated community in Raccoon Township, Parke County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. It is notable for its covered bridge, which was destroyed on April 28, 2005, by a fire set by an arsonist. A historically accurate reconstruction of the bridge was completed in October, 2006.\n\nAround 1823 a sawmill was built on the banks of Big Raccoon creek south of the Ten O'Clock Line by two men, Joseph Lockwood and Issac J. Sillman, for Joseph O'Niel and James Wasson. A buhrstone was added later to grind corn and wheat. Daniel Kalley and a James Searing would later buy the mill in 1837 from James and Mary Wasson for $1,600. Within a few several years a distillery was built but around 1845 the mill and distillery burned down.\n\nHere the story of the mill at Bridgeton splits between two different resources. One is from the Indiana Historical Society and the other is the paperwork submitted to the National Park Services for Bridgeton's application as an Historic District.\n\nThe NPR version states that by 1848 the Onsley brothers and William Bean would replace the mill with a hewn log building to fill the need of a local mill. That same year a hewn log bridge was built to span the Big Raccoon Creek giving farmers to the north of town easier access to the mill.\n\nThe Indiana Historical Society states that the fall after the mill was destroyed by fire that the townspeople staged a \"frolic\" to build a new log mill. Searing then sold the mill for $2,000 to James Mullikin and Dr. Henry T. Ketchem. Ketchum soon sold his share back to Searing and in 1851 Mullikin acquired complete ownership of the mill. Mullikin then, sometime before January 1859, tore down the mill and built a new one as well as a general store. Stones were installed for grinding corn as well as stones for wheat. In January 1859 William Beal purchased the mill and surrounding land but sold it to William Blaize in December 1860 for $8,000. In 1862 Ralph Sprauge would acquire the mill.\n\nSprague and his son-in-law, George W. Phelon, entered into a partnership to run the mill. The partnership was dissolved in 1874 with Sprague continuing to run the mill until he sold it in 1882 to Daniel Webster.\n\nDaniel Webster had been born three miles outside of Bridgeton in 1830. Webster had been a farmer and had made a small fortune in the coal mining business before investing in the mill.\n\nOriginally Bridgeton was known as Lockwood Mills for the local mill, but later became known as Sodom because of the drinking and fighting that took place. On Saturday's and public days the mill acted as a community social center with people conducting business and exchanging gossip. For twenty-five cents a gallon of whiskey could be bought and the townsmen would engage in horse races and sometimes fights. The village applied for a post office in 1849 and the name was changed to Bridgeton. The original plat was recorded the same year which included most of the town as it exists today.\n\nThe Bridgeton Historic District in the City of Bridgeton, Indiana is \"home to the oldest continuously operating mill west of the Allegheny Mountains.\"\n\nA significant figure in Bridgeton's history would be Ralph Sprague. In 1862 he bought the mill, however, in 1868 fire would claim this mill too. Sprague decided to rebuild and the present mill was erected in 1871, it is considered the most historically important building in the district.\n\nThe new mill, 1871, would be equipped with a large set of burr stones for feed, roller mills for flour, and a small set of burr stones for corn. The total cost was $14,000. With a sandstone foundation and heavy timber frame the mill stands three stories and is capped by a gable roof. Water would enter the basement through large arches in the foundation to power water turbines which would provide mechanical power for the mill.\n\nDaniel Webster bought the mill in 1882 for $15,000 and in 1886 hired the Richmond Milling Company to modernize the mill by replacing the burr stones with more efficient steel roll mills, sieves, and sifters. Under Webster's direction the mill prospered and came to be known as the Bridgeton Roller Mills.\n\nThe farmers originally paid for their milling services with 1/6th of their grain, in 1853 a new state law set it at 1/8th. During the Webster period the mill was operated on the exchange system. Farmers would receive 35 pounds of flour per bushel of wheat and forty pounds of meal per bushel of corn. The mill was capable of 75 barrels of flour per day. The Bridgeton Mill used assorted brand names over the years, including, Family, Anchor, White Satin, White Oak, Spring Wheat Patent, and Snowdrift for its flour.\n\nDaniel Webster died in 1895 and about three years later P.T. Winney of Clay County purchased the mill for $3,500. Winney had two 220 volt generators installed and from 1906 until his death in 1913 offered electricity for the town.\n\nGeorge E. Brake, Winney's stepson, and Fred A. Mitchell bought the mill in 1914 for $2,700 and finished reinforcing the dam, started by Winney, with poured concrete. By 1915 Charles Mitchell bought Fred A. Mitchell's interest in the mill but then in 1922 he sold it to Earl D. Miller.\n\nBrake and Miller would continue to run the mill until 1935 when Hugh W. Knoll purchased it, but only for a brief period, before selling it to A. Dale Hough for $3,000. Hough had a new foundation laid in the mill and installed a bleaching system for the flour. Charles D. Hansel would purchase the mill after Hough died in 1938.\n\nThe Bridgeton Mill followed the history of many other mills in Indiana when it was converted to a feed mill in 1938 by its new owner, C.D. Hansel. Hansel had the roll mill and burr stones removed and added a concrete block extension to the south.\n\nIn 1940 Ernest and Mildred Weise and their son Robert bought the mill, which they operated as the Weise Milling Company. With the construction of the Mansfield Dam in 1957, and the already declining water level of the Big Raccoon Creek, the Weises converted the mill to an electric powered feed grain operation. A glazed block office was added on east side of the mill. 1969 brought the end of daily operations at the mill though products were still produced and sold to tourists and by mail order year-round. In 1972 the Weises purchased some burr stones from an old mill in New Palestine and reinstalled them at the Bridgeton Mill. The mill was then bought by Mike and Karen Roe in 1995. Along with help, and recipes, from the Weise family, the mill continues to operate today \"10 till tired\", April 1 through the second weekend of December.\n\nRalph Sprague had this classic gabled ell house built in 1878.(pictured at right) Located on Main Street it is a two story wood-frame house featuring Italianate ornamentation resting on a sandstone foundation. The house is sheathed in wood clapboard siding and has two gable roof sections. Both the front and side gable ends feature distinctive \"1878\" oculus vents.\n\nSprague lived there until he sold the mill, which included the house, in 1882 to Daniel Webster. The Rockville Republican described Mr. Webster as, \"one of your fat, jolly old fellows you like to meet.\" Him and his family lived in the house and owned the mill until 1899. In 1899 James H. Kerr purchased the house but after his death it sat empty for many years until Chales Peffley eventually bought it. The house served as a single family residence until 1980 when it was converted into a gift shop. Locally it is known as the \"1878 House.\"\n\nIn 1869 the Freemasons built a three story Masonic Lodge across the street from where the present mill would be built. In 1913 the third story was removed (after a fire ravaged the upper story). The Lodge is the oldest building in Bridgeton. It is also one of the last Masonic Moon lodges left in the country. Because of poor roads and traveling conditions meetings were held on the night of the full moon, or within a few days before or after the full moon, to make travel safer and easier.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1886575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1886575", "title": "ITV News at Ten", "text": "ITV News at Ten\n\nNews at Ten is the flagship evening news programme on British television network ITV, produced by ITN and founded by news editor Geoffrey Cox in July 1967. The bulletin was the first permanent 30-minute news broadcast in the United Kingdom, and although initially scheduled for only thirteen weeks due to fears that its length would turn viewers off, the bulletin proved to be highly popular with audiences and became a fixture of the ITV schedule.\n\n\"News at Ten\" rose to popularity for its winning combination of in-depth, analytical news coverage and populist stories. It simultaneously helped popularise newscasters such as Alastair Burnet, Andrew Gardner, Reginald Bosanquet, Sandy Gall, Anna Ford, John Suchet, Mark Austin, Alastair Stewart and Trevor McDonald into well-known television personalities.\n\nWhen the bulletin was axed in 1999 in order for primetime entertainment programming to air uninterrupted, there was a public outcry. ITV reluctantly brought the programme back – under the name \"ITV News at Ten\" – in 2001, airing it at 10pm for a minimum of three nights per week, but eventually replaced it with the \"\" in 2004. It was not until January 2008 that \"News at Ten\" was reinstated to the ITV schedule. The programme is currently presented by Tom Bradby.\n\nITN had been ITV's news provider since the channel's launch in September 1955. News updates from ITN tended to run 14 minutes in length at most, with no fixed broadcast time. From his arrival in 1956, ITN editor Geoffrey Cox had consistently argued to the Independent Television Authority that ITN should be providing at least one news bulletin of substantial length, in order to cover and analyse major news stories more closely. ITV argued against the idea of a 30-minute evening bulletin, insisting a news programme of such length would eat into its primetime entertainment schedule and turn viewers away from the channel, but the ITA granted Cox's wish in 1967. ITV reluctantly agreed to give the proposed bulletin – a Monday-to-Friday programme, fixed at 10pm – a 13-week trial run to test its success.\n\"News at Ten\" began broadcasting on 3 July 1967 under the editorship of Cox, who stipulated that the aim of the new programme was to \"remove the spin and bring facts and the news as it really was.\" ITV's stance was seemingly confirmed early; the programme had little news to cover in its first few editions, having launched in the middle of summer during a slow news week. However, a reversal of fortunes quickly took place after an \"action story\" from ITN reporter Alan Hart on the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders re-entering Crater, which ran for a then-unheard-of length of 5 minutes. A series of similar in-depth reports eventually helped to give \"News at Ten\" a regular viewership of seven million every night, forcing ITV to keep the programme. By 1969, \"News at Ten\" had become the first news bulletin in Britain to enter the top 20 most-watched programmes of the week.\nThe arrival of the new 30-minute programme allowed ITN to give a more in-depth and detailed treatment of serious news for the first time on British television, as well as coverage of populist stories and issues that would attract the viewing audience. The programme built on these concepts by introducing reporter packages, not the norm then but now a staple of television news, and a team of two newscasters taking turns to read stories instead of a sole presenter: a two-man team would inject personality into television news, as well as allow breaking news to be handed to the newscaster not in vision. The original newscasting team included Alastair Burnet, Andrew Gardner, Reginald Bosanquet, George Ffitch and Leonard Parkin. \"News at Ten\" also employed several other distinctive features which proved popular with viewers: the use of Big Ben's chimes (or \"bongs\") to separate the news headlines being read in the opening sequence, and the \"… And Finally\" report – a quirky and often humorous end piece designed to send the viewing audience to bed \"on a high note\" after 30 minutes of hard news coverage.\n\n\"News at Ten\" developed a solid reputation for its extensive coverage of international news stories. Foreign correspondent Sandy Gall, the first ITN journalist to cover the start of the Vietnam War in 1965, returned there on several occasions to produce reports for \"News at Ten\" until he was forcibly removed from the country following the Fall of Saigon in 1975. Michael Nicholson reported in-depth on the 1976 Soweto uprising for \"News at Ten\", and later went on to cover the Falklands War in 1982, after which he was awarded the South Atlantic Medal for his work. \"News at Ten\", by now the UK's most popular news programme, ultimately forced the BBC to follow ITN's lead and extend its own programming to match, although Lord Annan declared in his 1977 \"Committee into the Future of Broadcasting\", \"We subscribe to the generally held view that ITN has the edge over BBC News.\"\n\nIn the absence of Alastair Burnet (who left ITN in 1972 to pursue a career in print journalism), \"News at Ten\" paired Andrew Gardner and Reginald Bosanquet to create one of the programme's most well liked newscasting duos. In 1978, Anna Ford became the bulletin's first female newscaster, and Alastair Burnet rejoined the programme in the same year. For more than a decade onwards, Burnet was the newscaster most associated with \"News at Ten\", his \"serious persona\", \"sepulchral tones\" and \"deferential interviewing style\" becoming respected hallmarks of the programme. By the late 1980s, Burnet – now a member of the ITN board of directors and \"News at Ten\"'s associate editor – began to draw criticism that he was losing the personal touch with his audience, allowing \"News at Ten\" to settle into a \"stodgy\" and \"old-fashioned\" complacency. Nonetheless, the programme continued to maintain a solid high audience during the 1980s and well into the next decade.\n\nThe development of satellite technology in the 1980s allowed \"News at Ten\" to broadcast live from several locations around the world, including the Great Wall of China during a visit from the Queen in 1986. Alastair Burnet presented \"News at Ten\" from the United States during several presidential campaigns, as well as the 1984 conventions of the Republican and Democratic parties. Alastair Stewart presented \"News at Ten\" live from Saudi Arabia, the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the liberated Kuwait City during the 1991 Gulf War.\n\nBurnet retired from ITN in 1991 after several clashes with the ITV companies over the future of the news organisation. In November 1992, \"News at Ten\" was given its first major relaunch, in part to address the criticism it had attracted over the last few years. In a bid to regain the personal touch that had been lost, the programme dispensed with the dual-presentation team in favour of a sole newscaster, Trevor McDonald, who subsequently became one of the most well-known newscasters in the UK. Julia Somerville, John Suchet and Dermot Murnaghan each presented \"News at Ten\" when McDonald was absent. The bulletin carried this format until March 1999.\n\nDespite \"News at Ten\"'s continued stature and popularity, ITV announced its intention to axe the bulletin in 1993, proposing two new peak-time bulletins at 6:30pm and 11pm. ITV justified the move as a measure to stem the decline in television viewing audiences and to allow the uninterrupted broadcast of movies, dramas and other entertainment programmes, but the plans were met with widespread criticism from viewers, several Members of Parliament, the then-Prime Minister John Major and the National Heritage Committee. The Independent Television Commission ruled that ITV had not established a solid case for the removal of \"News at Ten\", pointing to BBC News having experienced a larger viewing decline than ITN, but were restructuring the contents of their news programmes rather than move them to different timeslots. The proposals were eventually withdrawn after the ITC threatened ITV with legal action.\n\nIn September 1998, following intense lobbying from the ITV companies, the ITC finally reviewed plans for a new weekday primetime ITV schedule that saw the removal of \"News at Ten\" (and the 5:40pm \"Early Evening News\") in favour of new 6:30pm and 11:00pm news bulletins. The ITC undertook extensive audience research which found that the public preferred \"News at Ten\" to stay by a proportion of 5 to 3, but nonetheless granted ITV permission to axe \"News at Ten\" for a one-year trial period. The programme's demise in March 1999 coincided with an overhaul of news on ITV, which continued to be produced by ITN, but now branded on screen as ITV News. Trevor McDonald presented the new flagship \"ITV Evening News\" at 6:30pm, a one-minute news summary was broadcast at 10pm, and this was followed by the 20-minute \"ITV Nightly News\" at 11:00pm presented by Dermot Murnaghan. But these changes ultimately resulted in a 13.9% decline in overall viewing figures for ITV News.\nIn 2000, the ITC ordered ITV to reinstate \"News at Ten\" to stem the ratings decline. The BBC then decided to cash in on the move by shifting its own long-running \"Nine O'Clock News\" to 10pm. McDonald returned to front the retitled \"ITV News at Ten\" in 2001, with a dual-presenting team of Dermot Murnaghan and Mary Nightingale replacing McDonald on the \"ITV Evening News\". However, the haphazard scheduling of the revived 10pm bulletin ultimately led to its downfall. While the BBC's \"Ten O'Clock News\" was fixed at 10pm for six nights a week, the \"ITV News at Ten\" was broadcast for only three nights a week, allowing entertainment programmes to be broadcast past 10pm for the rest of the week. In addition, the programme was often delayed by overrunning entertainment programmes on the nights that it was scheduled for 10pm. This inconsistency led to the bulletin being unceremoniously dubbed \"News at When?\"\n\nIn 2003, ITV received approval from the ITC to axe the programme and replace it with the \"ITV News at 10:30\", fixed at that time every weeknight. McDonald presented this bulletin from its launch on 2 February 2004 until his retirement on 15 December 2005. Mark Austin became the programme's main host from January 2006.\n\nIn October 2007, ITV chairman Michael Grade announced the return of \"News at Ten\", following comments he made in March that the original removal of the programme was \"a shocking mistake [that] damaged ITV more than anything else.\" The bulletin returned with its original name on 14 January 2008, broadcast from Monday to Thursday at 10pm, with an 11pm bulletin titled \"The Late News\" airing on Friday evenings. The revived \"News at Ten\" saw the reintroduction of the dual-newscaster team, pairing new presenter Julie Etchingham with Trevor McDonald, who had temporarily come out of retirement. Etchingham and Mark Austin presented \"The Late News\". In March 2009, \"The Late News\" was dropped in order for \"News at Ten\" to return to its traditional Monday-to-Friday 10pm slot, giving the programme a \"consistent home at the heart of the schedule\".\n\nMcDonald finally retired from \"News at Ten\" in October 2008 after hosting the programme's special US election coverage from Washington and was replaced by Mark Austin in November. Austin presented the \"ITV News at 6:30\" simultaneously until he was replaced on that programme by Alastair Stewart.\n\n\"News at Ten\" struggled to regain its high viewing figures following several years out of the 10pm timeslot, its 2008 return watched by 3.8 million viewers in comparison to 4.9m for the BBC. However, the bulletin occasionally beat the \"BBC News at 10\" in the ratings: an overrunning football match on BBC One helped deliver ITV 4.3m at 10pm; severe weather conditions on 2 February 2009 saw terrestrial TV news bulletins receive a boost in ratings and \"News at Ten\" was watched by 4.8m; and a week of special \"Britain's Got Talent\" semi-final programmes in May 2009 saw \"News at Ten\" beat the BBC with figures of 6.1m (26 May) and 6.4m (28 May), the latter being the programme's highest audience figure since 2003.\n\nIn November 2009, the famous Big Ben clock tower was removed from the programme's opening credits after concerns it alienated viewers outside London, but was ultimately reinstated to \"News at Ten\"'s opening sequence following a further ITV relaunch in January 2013. From November 2009 onwards, the bulletin has been titled on screen as \"ITV News at Ten\".\n\nAs part of a move to enhance the reputation of ITV's news and current affairs output, \"News at Ten\" was restructured and redeveloped across a number of months: the new format launched in October 2015, placing more emphasis on analysis, context and a more \"conversational\" presentation style under new presenter Tom Bradby, former ITV News political editor; then the appointments of former BBC News journalists Robert Peston (as political editor) and Allegra Stratton (as national editor), who both reiterated in the press ITV's newfound intention to challenge the dominance of BBC News; and a refreshed set and opening title sequence in January 2016.\n\nIn November 2015, it was reported that tension had developed between senior figures at the BBC and ITV following comments made about the viewing figures for both 10pm news bulletins: prior to the \"News at Ten\" relaunch, Bradby commented on the powerful nature of BBC News during an interview with The Telegraph, saying that the scheduling of BBC One's 10pm news against ITV's \"News at Ten\" was not in the public interest and that the corporation should \"mount a strategic retreat\". The BBC's Huw Edwards posted on Facebook that ITV should end its \"creative handling of audience figures\". A senior ITV News executive said to The Guardian that the BBC's attitude \"is such [that] they are trying to smash and crush us\" and that the corporation's \"arrogance has got to such a level.\" Nigel Dacre, editor of ITV News between 1995 and 2001, criticised the channel's use of \"junction management\", which involves the deliberate overrunning of the 9pm programme so that viewing figures for \"News at Ten\" are inflated.\n\nAs an experiment to try and boost ITV's viewing figures at the 10pm slot, on Monday 27 February 2017, \"News at Ten\" moved to 10.30pm for eight consecutive weeks to make way for new entertainment programme \"The Nightly Show\". The bulletin returned to its original 10pm timeslot from 24 April 2017.\n\nFor a number of weeks in the run-up to the 2017 general election \"News at Ten\" was extended by 15 minutes, pushing the late regional news to 10:45pm.\n\nOn 3 January 2018, a fire alarm forced ITV News staff to evacuate the building during the live broadcast of \"News at Ten\". By the time crew members were allowed into the studio, the following programme was already on air.\n\n\"News at Ten\" is famed for its use of the Big Ben clockface, the headline \"bongs\" and the dramatic and familiar theme music, all retained and reworked into various guises across five decades.\n\nFrom 1967 to 1992, its opening and closing themes were straightforward excerpts from \"The Awakening\", a piece of library music composed by Johnny Pearson. In 1992, composer Dave Hewson was appointed to produce a new arrangement of \"The Awakening\". Since April 1995, Hewson has produced several rearrangements of the famous theme for all ITV News programmes.\n\nThe story of the adaptation of \"The Awakening\" was featured in an official TV tie-in book, although incorrectly referring to the title music as \"Arabesque\":\n\nThe most memorable series of \"News at Ten\" title sequences launched in 1969: a camera pan across the Houses of Parliament and up the Westminster Clock Tower, followed by a sharp zoom into the tower clockface and the programme's name appearing on screen in time to the strident beats of \"The Awakening\", with the headline \"bongs\" playing directly afterwards. (If the bulletin started significantly after 10pm, the \"bongs\" were dispensed with.) Further refreshes of the opening sequence continued to use this basic concept for several years afterwards, even after the introduction of computer-generated titles in 1988 which incorporated a virtual flyover nighttime London. As part of the programme's 1992 revamp, the familiar sequence was replaced by simple camera shots of the clock tower and ITN's headquarters. In 2008, \"News at Ten\" reworked its 1988 flyover sequence for its relaunch. The programme used the same opening titles as other ITV News bulletins from 2001 to 2004 and again from 2009 to 2016, all loosely based on elements established by \"News at Ten\" title sequences from its early days. In 2016, a new title sequence was introduced focusing more closely on the traditional image of the Big Ben clockface.\n\n\"News at Ten\" won its first award from the National Viewers and Listeners Association in August 1968. The programme has been honoured over the years by the prestigious RTS Television Journalism Awards, including the \"News – International coverage\" award in 1997 and the coveted \"News Programme of the Year\" in 1998, 2010 and 2014.\n\nThe programme has received the BAFTA \"News Coverage\" award twice: in 2009 for their coverage of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake; and in 2010 for the 2010 Haiti earthquake.\n\n\"News at Ten\" has also won awards in the television/news programme categories at the International Emmy awards (2009) and the Plain English Awards (2010).\n\n"}
{"id": "1886587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1886587", "title": "Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk", "text": "Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk\n\nFrances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk (née Brandon; 16 July 1517 – 20 November 1559), was an English noblewoman, the second child and eldest daughter of King Henry VIII's younger sister, Princess Mary, and Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. She was the mother of Lady Jane Grey, de facto Queen of England and Ireland from 10 July until 19 July 1553, as well as Lady Katherine Grey and Lady Mary Grey.\n\nFrances Brandon was born on 16 July 1517 in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, and spent her childhood in the care of her mother. Although her father, the Duke of Suffolk, had obtained a declaration of nullity regarding his earlier marriage to Margaret Neville (the widow of John Mortimer) on the ground of consanguinity, in 1528 he secured a bull from Pope Clement VII assuring the legitimacy of his marriage with Mary Tudor, and therefore the legitimacy of his daughter Frances. Frances was close to her aunt Catherine of Aragon, first wife of her uncle King Henry VIII, and was a childhood friend of her first cousin, the future Queen Mary I.\n\nIn 1533 Frances married Henry Grey, Marquess of Dorset. The marriage took place at Suffolk Place, a mansion which belonged to her parents on the west side of Borough High Street in Southwark.\n\nHer first two pregnancies resulted in the births of a son and daughter who both died young. These were followed by three surviving daughters:\n\nFrances is considered to have been a strong and energetic woman. Her residence at Bradgate was a minor palace in Tudor style. After the death of her two brothers, the title Duke of Suffolk reverted to the crown, and was granted to her husband as a new creation. She saw to it that her daughters were well educated. Around 1541 Bishop John Aylmer was made chaplain to the duke, and tutor of Greek to Frances's daughter, Lady Jane Grey.\n\nAs the niece of Henry VIII, Frances was frequently at court. It was through her friendship with Katherine Parr that Frances's daughter Jane secured a place in the queen's household. There, Jane came into contact with Henry VIII's son and future successor, Edward. Henry VIII died on 28 January 1547, and Edward VI succeeded to the throne. Jane followed Katherine Parr to her new residence and was soon established as a member of the inner circle of the nine year old king.\n\nFrances was third-in-line to the English throne, following Edward's half-sisters Mary (later Queen Mary I) and Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth I), because Henry VIII's elder sister Margaret Tudor's descendants had been removed from the succession. This took place under the terms of the Will of King Henry VIII which laid out the succession to the throne.\n\nKatherine Parr then married Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley and Lord High Admiral. Lady Jane followed her to her new household. Frances, her husband, and other members of the aristocracy saw Jane as a possible wife for the young King.\n\nKatherine Parr died on 5 September 1548. Jane returned home. Seymour, on the other hand, pressed the Suffolks with demands that he held Jane's wardship and she should be returned to his household. Jane returned to Seymour's household and moved into Katherine Parr's apartments. Seymour still planned to convince Edward VI to marry Jane, but the King had become distrustful of his two uncles. An increasingly desperate Seymour invaded the King's bedchamber in an attempt to abduct him, and shot Edward's beloved dog when the animal tried to protect its master. Not long after Seymour was tried for treason and executed on 10 March 1549. The Suffolks convinced the Privy Council of their innocence in Seymour's scheme. Jane was again recalled home. The Duke and Duchess lost hope of marrying her to the King, who was sickly and thought likely not to live. For a time it is claimed they contemplated marrying her to Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford, son of the Lord Protector and Anne Stanhope. However, the Lord Protector fell from power and was replaced by John Dudley. \n\nIn May 1553 Guildford Dudley, the second youngest son of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, and \"de facto\" regent during the young Edward VI's minority, married Frances's daughter Jane. Her daughter Katherine was married to Henry Herbert, the son and heir of William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke at Durham House. Dudley's daughter Katherine, was promised to Henry Hastings, heir of the Earl of Huntingdon. At the time they took place the alliances were not seen as politically important, not even by the Imperial ambassador Jehan de Scheyfye, who was the most suspicious observer. Often perceived as proof of a conspiracy to bring the Dudley family to the throne, they have also been described as routine matches between aristocrats.\n\nIt has been claimed since the early 18th century that Lady Jane was brutally beaten and whipped into submission by the Duchess. However, there is no historic evidence for it. Lord Guildford was, as a fourth son, not the greatest match for an eldest daughter of royal descent, and William Cecil, another close friend of the Suffolks, claimed the match was brokered by Katherine Parr's brother and his second wife. According to Cecil, they promoted the match to Northumberland who responded rather enthusiastically. The Suffolks did not favour the match much, since it would have meant passing the crown out of their family to Northumberland's. However, since Northumberland claimed to have the King's support in the matter, they finally gave in. The only historic proof of some family quarrel concerning the marriage is written down by Commendone as \"the first-born daughter of the Duke of Suffolk, Jane by name, who although strongly deprecating the marriage, was compelled to submit by the insistence of her mother and the threats of her father\".\n\nBy June 1553, Edward VI was seriously ill. The succession of his Catholic half-sister Mary would compromise the English Reformation. Edward opposed Mary's succession, not only on religious grounds but also on those of legitimacy and male inheritance, which also applied to Elizabeth. He drafted a document in which he undertook to change the succession, as had his father. Edward passed over the claims of his half-sisters and settled the Crown on his cousin Jane Grey. In doing so he also passed over Frances who otherwise would have been the heir presumptive. It is not clear to what extent Northumberland may have influenced the king's plan, but he supported it.\n\nFrances and especially her husband were at first outraged, but eventually, after a private audience with the King, she had to renounce her own rights to the throne in favour of Jane.\n\nFrances and her husband approved the plans for the succession.\n\nEdward VI died on 6 July 1553. Lady Jane was declared queen on 10 July. The Duchess joined her for the proclamation and during her stay in the Tower. She had been fetched when Northumberland realised Jane's confusion and overwhelming feelings, and she managed to calm her daughter down. Since she had seen the King himself and spoken to him about the succession, she could convince Jane that she was the rightful queen and heir. Their success was short-lived. Jane was deposed by armed support in favour of Mary I on 19 July 1553.\n\nThe Duke of Suffolk was arrested, but released days later thanks to the Duchess' intervention. The moment she heard of her husband's arrest, she rode over to Mary in the middle of the night to plead for her family. Despite all odds, not only did the Duchess manage to be received by the Queen, but also could secure him a pardon by placing all the blame on Northumberland. While in his household, Lady Jane had fallen sick of food poisoning and had suspected Northumberland's family. The Duchess now used her daughter's suspicions and her husband's sickness to accuse Northumberland of having tried to kill her family. Therefore, Mary was willing to pardon the Duke of Suffolk. She intended to pardon Jane once her coronation was complete, sparing the 16-year-old's life.\n\nHowever, Wyatt the younger declared a revolt against Mary on 25 January 1554. The Duke of Suffolk joined the rebellion, but was captured by Francis Hastings, 2nd Earl of Huntingdon. The revolt had failed by February. The plot ringleaders had wished to supplant Mary with her half-sister Elizabeth, although Elizabeth played no part in the matter. After the attempt to put Jane on the throne Frances was confined in the Tower of London for a time. Jane was now becoming too dangerous for Mary and was beheaded on 12 February 1554 with her husband. Jane's father was convicted of high treason and was executed eleven days later on 23 February 1554. With two young daughters barely in their teens and her husband a convicted traitor, the Duchess faced ruin. As a wife, she held no possessions in her own right. All her husband's possessions would return to the Crown, as usual for traitors' property. She managed to plead with the Queen to show mercy, which meant at least she and her daughters had the chance of rehabilitation. The Queen's forgiveness meant some of Suffolk's property would remain with his family, or at least could be granted back at some later time.\n\nFrances lived in poverty during the reign of Mary I. Mary I made a point of placing her by her side, favoured but kept under the observation of the queen. She was still regarded with some suspicion and in April 1555 the Spanish ambassador, Simon Renard wrote of a possible match between Frances and Edward Courtenay, a Plantagenet descendant.\n\nOnce again, their children would have had a claim to the throne, but Courtenay was reluctant, and Frances escaped the marriage by another, much safer match. She married her Master of the Horse, Adrian Stokes. It was a safe marriage for her, since any children from it would be considered too low-born to compete for the throne. Her childhood friend and stepmother Katherine Willoughby had married her gentleman usher, so Frances moved on familiar ground. She and Stokes married in 1555. \nThree children were born to the couple:\n\nFrances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk died on 20 November 1559. She was buried at Westminster Abbey at the expense of Elizabeth. Her daughter Katherine acted as chief mourner. Four years after her death, her husband crowned the grave with Frances' effigy which still remains. The inscription on her grave reads in Latin: \n\nFrances Grey's posthumous reputation for being insensitive or cruel is largely based on Roger Ascham's account of a statement of her daughter Jane: \n\nFrom this passage it was – and still is – deduced that Frances and Henry Grey had mistreated their daughter. However, Ascham wrote these words years after the actual meeting, and to promote the idea that children learned well under a kind tutor. Also, his view might have been influenced by the later events concerning the Greys. The letter he wrote to Jane just a few months after the visit speaks admiringly of her parents and praises both Jane's and their virtues. James Haddon, chaplain of the Greys, told his acquaintance Michel Angelo Florio how Jane was following in her parents' footsteps concerning piety, and how close she was to her mother Frances. Jane's age certainly played a role in her words. At the age of fourteen and highly aware of her brightness and people's admiration of it, it couldn't sit well with Jane to still have to submit to her parents' authority. The Tudor times demanded, of all virtues, obedience, and Jane was spirited enough to even make her beloved teacher Aylmer agree with her parents that it was necessary to \"provide bridles for restive horses.\"\n\nThe alleged abuse of her daughter as well as her role in the machinations to bring Jane the crown are the subject of historical debate. While Jane was already with her husband Guildford Dudley, under the supervision of his parents, she heard news that Edward VI was changing his will to exclude her mother from the succession and name Jane as his heir instead. Jane, startled by the news, asked her mother-in-law permission to visit her mother, yet was met with refusal. Ignoring her, Jane sneaked out of the house and went back home. The evil mother from the myth was accused of having beaten Jane into submission to marry Guildford Dudley and certainly would not have taken kindly to her daughter running away from her husband. However, if Frances' claim of having opposed the match from the beginning on is true, Jane fleeing to her makes perfect sense. In fact, Frances was noted for her hospitality and generosity. When her brother-in-law's children Thomas, Margaret and Francis Willoughby were orphaned, the Greys took them under their wings. Thomas soon joined Henry and Charles Brandon at college and his siblings went to live with their uncle George Medley. However, during the Wyatt rebellion, Medley was imprisoned and taken to the Tower. At the time he was released, the imprisonment had taken its toll on him and he couldn't take care of the children any longer. Frances had already lost her eldest daughter, her husband and a considerable part of her lands. Nevertheless, she once more resumed care of Francis and Margaret Willoughby, organized a place in school for the boy and took the girl to court, along with herself and her surviving daughters.\n\nTheir elder brother was placed as ward under a Councillor's care. Since Thomas was his father's heir, the councillor had control over the Willoughby fortune during Thomas' minority.\n\nAs biographer Leanda de Lisle writes: \n\nFrances, Duchess of Suffolk was portrayed by Sara Kestelman in the 1986 film \"Lady Jane\" and by Julia James in a 1956 episode of the BBC's \"Sunday Night Theatre\".\n"}

The Social Democratic Party, under the lead of Cavaco Silva, won a historic third term and won with an absolute majority for the second consecutive turn, achieving a higher share than in the previous election, losing, however, 13 MPs due to the reduction of the overall number from the original 250 to 230. Cavaco Silva became the first Prime Minister since Hintze Ribeiro, in 1904, to lead a party into three successive democratic election victories.\n\nThe Socialist Party, at the time led by Jorge Sampaio, the future President of Portugal, increased its share by 7% and gained 12 MPs, but did not manage to avoid the absolute majority of the Social Democrats. In the first legislative election after the fall of the Eastern Bloc, the communist dominated Democratic Unity Coalition lost much of its electoral influence, losing 14 MPs and 4% of the voting.\n\nOn the right, the CDS could not recover its past influence, mainly to the effect of tactical voting for the Social Democratic Party by right-wing voters, increasing its parliamentary group by only 1 MP. The National Solidarity Party, using a populist campaign, achieved for the first time an MP, in what would be the only presence of such party in the Parliament.\n\nVoter turnout fell to 67.8%, and for the first time below 70% of the electorate.\n\nThe Assembly of the Republic has 230 members elected to four-year terms. The total number of MPs was reduced in 1989, during the Constitutional amendments, to 230 from the previous 250. Governments do not require absolute majority support of the Assembly to hold office, as even if the number of opposers of government is larger than that of the supporters, the number of opposers still needs to be equal or greater than 116 (absolute majority) for both the Government's Programme to be rejected or for a motion of no confidence to be approved.\n\nThe number of seats assigned to each district depends on the district magnitude.

He worked as a civil servant, founded the political blog \"Left Foot Forward\" and is currently an associate director of the think-tank Institute for Public Policy Research, specialising in climate change, energy and transport.\n\nIn the lead up to 2016's referendum on European Union membership, he was the executive director of Britain Stronger in Europe, the all-party umbrella organisation that unsuccessfully fought for the United Kingdom to remain a member of the European Union.\n\nStraw was born in Lambeth, London in 1980. His parents are Alice Perkins and Jack Straw. He attended the comprehensive Pimlico School. In January 1998, aged 17, he was caught trying to sell £10 of cannabis, after a friend was paid £2,000 by the \"Daily Mirror\" to introduce him to an undercover reporter posing as an acquaintance. The story caused some embarrassment for his father, who was Home Secretary at the time, both for his opposition to legalising cannabis and his stance on parents taking responsibility for the poor behaviour or criminality of their children.\n\nHe went to Oxford University where he read Politics, Philosophy and Economics (PPE) and was elected President of the Junior Common Room of New College and the Oxford University Student Union in 2001. In 2001, he and several other OUSU campaigners protested against tuition fees on the steps of Oxford's Bodleian Library by throwing off most of their clothes to reveal gold-painted torsos. After Oxford, he read for a master's degree in public administration as a Fulbright Scholar at Columbia University.\n\nStraw worked for a year as an adviser on enterprise and growth issues, in HM Treasury under Gordon Brown. In 2009, he founded the political blog \"Left Foot Forward\", which was set up professionally as a counter to right wing media in the United Kingdom, and was sponsored by a variety of individuals and institutions, including Peter Kellner, Patrick Carter and the unions Connect and Unite.\n\nThe blog grew to have about forty writers; Straw left it in 2010 to join the Institute for Public Policy Research.\n\nIn 2009, Straw was one of twelve governors removed by Lambeth Council amid concerns over financial management and poor teaching at Henry Fawcett Primary School in Kennington. He was personally criticised at the time as he had mostly been residing in the US and it had been suggested he was a governor solely for the prestige of his name.\n\nStraw was the parliamentary candidate for the Labour Party, for the constituency of Rossendale and Darwen in the 2015 general election, but lost to the Conservative incumbent Jake Berry. Straw was one of 15 Labour candidates each given financial support of £10,000 by Lord Oakeshott the former Liberal Democrat in January 2015.\n\nIn April 2014, he posed with a local folk-dancing troupe, the Britannia Coconut Dancers. This generated some controversy, because of their use of blackface makeup, which Straw defended as a traditional custom.\n\nAlong with Euan Blair (son of former British prime minister Tony Blair), Stephen Kinnock (son of former Labour Leader Neil Kinnock), and Joe Dromey (son of Labour MPs Harriet Harman and Jack Dromey), Straw has been criticised for being a 'Red Prince', which refers to the son of a Labour politician who goes into politics. It is suggested that this nepotism allows them better access to educational, employment and political opportunities.\n\nStraw was the executive director of Britain Stronger in Europe, the group that campaigned for the United Kingdom to remain in the European Union, ahead of the 2016 referendum. He was awarded a CBE in outgoing Prime Minister David Cameron's controversial resignation honours in 2016. He stated the only reason he accepted the award was to be able to take his wife to Buckingham Palace.\n\nStraw lives in Kennington, London and Darwen, Lancashire. He is married to Claire Straw (née Howard), an American, with whom he has a son, Matthew, born in 2013.\n\n"}

Before its naming in 1839, TB had been called \"consumption\" during much of its 4,500-year history as a human disease dating from Babylonian writings and Egyptian mummies.\n\nBeginning with just eight patients but ending its first year with 45 in residence, Oakdale continued to grow, which forced repeated expansions, including a major one during 1926. Size of the associated farm ground also was increased to nearly 500 acres (200 hectares) from an original 280 acres (110 hectares). Its patient census peaked during the 1940s at about 400.\n\nImproving public health standards and development of the first drug cure for TB in 1944 caused Oakdale usage to decline and the facility was morphed briefly into an alcohol treatment center about 1960 as alternate uses were sought. The entire facility and land were transferred to University of Iowa ownership in 1965, and the last tuberculosis patient was transferred to University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in 1981.\n\nThe university established its Agricultural Medical Research Facility at Oakdale in 1966 as the first step of a major evolution of this rural satellite campus, which now also houses the State Hygienic Laboratory in a new facility, as well as the university's 197-acre Oakdale Research Park, where, among many other facilities, the National Advanced Driving Simulator is located.\n\nA separate entity that also carries the Oakdale name because of its proximity but was never a part of historic Oakdale, the Iowa prison system's Iowa Medical and Classification Center is located immediately across the road from the main Oakdale campus. The facility was opened in 1969 on slightly more than 50 acres (20 hectares) and now has more than 500 beds.

Before the Second Seminole War, the Seminoles had lived in log cabins. Similar structures were used by the tribes in south Florida when the Spanish first arrived in the 16th century. Each chickee had its own purpose and together they were organized within a camp-type community. Chickees were used for cooking, sleeping, and eating.\n\nChickees continue to be used by Native American villages of the Miccosukee in the Everglades. Some upscale homes in southern Florida feature chickee-inspired buildings as garden or poolside structures. A few restaurants in Florida still use this exotic design to attract visitors.\nChickees are also used in backcountry areas of Everglades National Park including along the Everglades Wilderness Waterway where mangroves or wetlands prevent camping on dry land. Made and maintained primarily for backcountry campers, these wooden structures stand several feet above the water and can usually accommodate four to five campers. These structures have portable restrooms. Some \"double chickees\" are linked by a walkway and can accommodate eight to ten people. \nThere are about eight to ten chickees in one village. Chickees are very helpful, especially in the rain.

He has scored over 1,000 points in Super Rugby, and nearly 500 test points for the Wallabies. Mortlock is a former Wallaby, Melbourne Rebels and Brumbies captain.\n\nBorn in Sydney, Australia, Mortlock began playing rugby with Lindfield Juniors. Mortlock was educated at The King's School in Parramatta Sydney. He represented Gordon Juniors at Colt level and still represents Gordon at club level today. He represented Australia at Under 19 and Under 21 level before pursuing a professional career with the Brumbies.\n\nIn 1998, Mortlock joined the ACT Brumbies. He was part of the Brumbies Super Rugby championships team in 2001. In 2004 he succeeded George Gregan as ACT Brumbies Captain and played every game that season except the final due to injury and thus was unable to lead the team to claim the Super 12 title that year.\n\nThen Wallaby coach Rod McQueen plucked Mortlock out of club rugby at the young age of 20 to tour Argentina with the Wallabies in 1997.\n\nIn 2000, he made his Test debut against Argentina.\n\n2000 was a landmark year for Mortlock – he became the fastest Australian to reach 50 and 100 Test points, he scored the most points and highest number of penalties [16] by any Australian in his first five Tests and created history by becoming the first Australian to score 20 points or more in four consecutive Tests. With the Wallaby team, Mortlock was instrumental in the famous Bledisloe and Tri-Nation Series' Victories of 2000. He scored a sideline penalty goal in 2000 against South Africa in Durban to win Australia's first Tri Nations crown.\n\nMortlock won man-of-the-match and had an 80-metre intercept try at then-Telstra Stadium to help knock the All Blacks out of the 2003 Rugby World Cup in the semifinal.\n\nIn 2006, Mortlock became the 73rd player to captain the Wallabies. In 2007, Mortlock was made co-captain with Phil Waugh.\n\nIn February 2008, Mortlock announced that he hoped to continue playing with the Wallabies until at least the end of 2010. Australian Rugby Union CEO John O'Neill endorsed this decision saying that Mortlock is a \"real captain courageous\" and an \"inspirational leader\".\n\nHe missed Wallabies' selection in October 2010. A press release from the Rebels said Mortlock was recuperating after surgery, and hoped to be \"training in full by December.\"\n\nThe Melbourne Rebels signed Mortlock in March 2010, to a three-year deal for an undisclosed amount.\nMortlock was declared the Rebels inaugural Captain on 2 February 2011, with former Wales international Gareth Delve as Vice-Captain.\n\nIn June 2012, Mortlock announced he would retire as a player at the end of the 2012 Super Rugby season, However, in 2013 he continued with the Rebels in a supporting role.\n\nMortlock was named Super Rugby player of the year in 2002. In 2008, Mortlock's ability to score tries and kick goals positioned him third on the all-time list of Australian Test point scorers (with 473 points). In May 2009, in the Super 14 match between the Auckland Blues and the ACT Brumbies Mortlock became the highest points scorer in Super Rugby history, surpassing New Zealand's Andrew Mehrtens. He currently sits on 1019 Super Rugby points. He is the sixth player for the Brumbies to achieve 100 caps.\n\nMortlock was made a Member of the Order of Australia in the 2012 Australia Day Honours List.\n\n\n"}

This was the deliberate rotation of the Liberal and Conservative parties in the government, so no sector of the bourgeoisie felt isolated, while all other parties were excluded from the system. This was achieved by electoral fraud. Opposition to the system came from republicans, socialists, anarchists, Basque and Catalan nationalists, and Carlists.\n\nThe \"pronunciamiento\" by Martinez Campos established Alfonso XII as king, marking the end of the First Spanish Republic. After this, the Constitution of 1876 was written and enforced during the whole restoration. This constitution established Spain as a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral legislature (Cortes Generales), consisting of an upper house (Senate), and a lower house (Congress of Deputies). This constitution gave the King the power to name Senators and to revoke laws if he wanted to, and he was also given the title of Commander-in-chief of the army.\n\nThese years were marked by economic prosperity. Spain's economy had fallen behind those of the other European countries, and during these years the modernization of the country took place on a large scale. On most fronts production was increased, supported by extreme protectionist measures.\n\nThe two parties alternated in the government in a controlled process known as \"el turno pacífico\"; the Liberal Party was led by Sagasta and the Conservative Party by Canovas del Castillo. The \"caciques\", powerful local figures, were used to manipulate election results, and as a result resentment of the system slowly built up over time and important nationalist movements in Catalonia, Galicia and the Basque Country, as well as unions, started to form.\n\nIn 1898, Spain lost its last major overseas colonies (Cuba, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines) in the Spanish–American War. The rapid collapse was perceived as a disaster in Spain, undermining the credibility of both the government and its associated ideologies and almost leading to a military coup d'état led by Camilo Polavieja. This was the start of the system's decline, giving energy to all manner of conflicting opposition movements at a local and national level.\n\nThe failed attempts to conquer Morocco (Melilla War) caused great discontent at home and ended in a revolt in Barcelona, known as the Semana Tragica, in which the lower classes of Barcelona, backed by the anarchists, communists, and republicans, revolted against what they considered the unjust methods for recruiting soldiers. The government declared a state of war and sent the army to crush the revolt, causing over a hundred deaths and the execution of Francisco Ferrer. The socialist Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT) and the anarchist Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) decided to initiate a general strike across the country, but it failed because the unions could only mobilize urban workers.\n\nThe problems in Morocco worsened as an army of natives attacked the Spanish army. They achieved surprise and, due to the skill of the Moroccan chieftain, Abd-Al-Krim, virtually annihilated the Spanish army, advancing almost as far as Melilla in the Battle of Annual. This Spanish defeat was due to improper planning and was blamed on the top military officers, causing great discontent among the military, who felt misunderstood, because they had been directed to advance into the interior without adequate resources to occupy the difficult territory.\n\nThe military discontent, the fear of anarchist terrorism or a proletarian revolution, and the rise of nationalist movements ultimately caused great agitation amongst the civilians and the military. On 13 September 1923, Miguel Primo de Rivera, Captain General of Catalonia, orchestrated a coup d'état, after issuing a manifesto blaming the problems of Spain on the parliamentary system. Alfonso XIII backed the General and named him Prime Minister. Primo de Rivera proceeded to suspend the Constitution and assume absolute powers as a dictator. He created the Unión Patriótica Española, which was meant to be the sole legal party, abolishing all other parties. During this time, he greatly increased government spending on business and public services, which caused his government to go bankrupt. He lost the support of the military and faced serious health problems. Opposition to his regime was so great that Alfonso XIII stopped supporting him and forced him to resign in January 1930.\n\nAlfonso XIII, in an attempt to return gradually to the previous system and restore his prestige, called on General Dámaso Berenguer to form a government. This failed utterly, as the King was considered a supporter of the dictatorship, and more and more political forces called for the establishment of a republic. Berenguer resigned and the King gave the government to Admiral Juan Bautista Aznar. Aznar called for local elections on 12 April 1931 in order to satisfy the democrats and republicans, to replace the dictatorship's local governments and to gradually re-introduce the restoration.\n\nAlthough the monarchists had not lost all their support, the republican and socialist parties won some significant victories in major cities. Street riots ensued, calling for the removal of the monarchy. The army declared that they would not defend the King and on 14 April he fled Spain. The Second Spanish Republic was immediately established under a provisional government led by Niceto Alcalá-Zamora.\n\n"}
{"id": "1886671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1886671", "title": "Black drink", "text": "Black drink\n\nBlack drink is a name for several kinds of ritual beverages brewed by Native Americans in the Southeastern United States. Traditional ceremonial people of the Yuchi, Caddo, Chickasaw, Cherokee, Choctaw, Muscogee and some other Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands use the black drink in purification ceremonies. It was occasionally known as \"white drink\" because of the association of the color white with peace leaders in some Native cultures in the Southeast.\n\nThe preparation and protocols vary between tribes and ceremonial grounds; a prominent ingredient is the roasted leaves and stems of \"Ilex vomitoria\" (commonly known as yaupon holly), a plant native to the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Black drink also usually contains emetic herbs.\n\nAccording to the ethnohistorical record, the yaupon leaves and branches used for the black drink were traditionally picked as close to the time of its planned consumption as possible. After picking, historically they were lightly parched in a ceramic container over fire. The roasting increases the solubility in water of the caffeine, which is the same reason coffee beans are roasted. After browning, they were boiled in large containers of water until the liquid reached a dark brown or black color, giving it its name. The liquid was then strained into containers to cool, until it was cool enough to not scald the skin, and drunk while still hot. Because caffeine is 30 times more soluble in boiling water than room temperature water, this heightened its effect. It was then consumed in a ritual manner. Its physiological effects are believed to be mainly those of massive doses of caffeine. Three to six cups of strong coffee is equal to 0.5 to 1.0 grams of caffeine; the black drink could have delivered at least this much and possibly up to 3.0 to 6.0 grams of caffeine. Owen gives the caffeine content of coffee as between 1.01 and 1.42 percent In comparison, \"Ilex vomitoria\" leaves contain 0.0038 to 0.2288 percent caffeine by weight according to experiments performed by Adam Edwards in 2002. Similar methods of production were adopted by European colonists for the production of a drink that often shared the same names with Native names for the black drink but used for different, secular purposes.\n\nWhile the general method of production is known, not all details of the preparation and ceremonial usage of the black drink are. The source of the emetic effect of black drink is not known and has been speculated upon by historians, archaeologists, and botanists. Some professionals believe it to be caused by the addition of poisonous button snakeroot.\n\nContemporary preparation and usage of the black drink by Native Americans is less well documented. Online recipes for the black drink have been criticized by some Native Americans as potentially dangerous and potentially poisonous due to those recipes leaving out key steps. The berries of the yaupon holly are poisonous. Kidney failure is one possible outcome of consuming beverages containing holly leaves. Adam Edwards and Bradley Bennett tested stems, roots, and leaves of the yaupon. They found that the only possible toxic substance was theobromine, an alkaloid, but the amounts of the chemical were so low that a single gram of cocoa contained over 2,255 times more theobromine than yaupon.\n\nArchaeologists have demonstrated the use of various kinds of black drink among Native American groups stretching back far into antiquity, possibly dating to Late Archaic times. During the Hopewell period, the shell cups known from later black drink rituals become common in high-status burials along with mortuary pottery and engraved stone and copper tablets. The significance of the shell cups may indicate the beginning of black drink ceremonialism. The fact that both the shells and the yaupon holly come from the same geographical location may indicate they were traded together in the Hopewell Interaction Sphere. The appearance of shell cups can be used as a virtual marker for the advent of Hopewell Culture in many instances. During the Mississippian culture period, the presence of items associated with the black drink ceremony had spread over most of the south, with many hundreds of examples from Etowah, Spiro, Moundville and Hiwassee Island.\n\nArchaeologists working at Cahokia, the largest Mississippian culture settlement located near the modern city of St. Louis, found distinctive and relatively rare pottery beakers dating from 1050 to 1250 CE. The beakers are small round pots with a handle on one side and a tiny lip on the opposing side. The surfaces of the unfired vessels was incised with motifs representing water and the underworld and resemble the whelk shells known to have been used for the consumption of the beverage during historic times. The inside of the vessels were found to be coated with a plant residue, which when tested was found to contain theobromine, caffeine and ursolic acid in the right proportions to have come from the \"Ilex vomitoria\". The presence of the black drink in the Greater Cahokia area at this early date pushes back the definitive use of the black drink by several centuries. The presence of the black drink hundreds of miles outside of its natural range on the East and Gulf coasts is evidence of a substantial trade network with the southeast, a trade that also involved sharks teeth and whelk shells.\n\nIn historic accounts from the 16th and 17th century, the black drink is usually imbibed in rituals using a cup made of marine shell. Three main species of marine shells have been identified as being used as cups for the black drink, lightning whelk, emperor helmet, and the horse conch. The most common was the lightning whelk, which has a left-handed or sinistral spiral. The left-handed spiral may have held religious significance because of its association with dance and ritual. The center columnella, which runs longitudinally down the shell, would be removed, and the rough edges sanded down to make a dipper-like cup. The columnella would then be used as a pendant, a motif that shows up frequently in Southeastern Ceremonial Complex designs. In the archaeological record columnella pendants are usually found in conjunction with bi-lobed arrows, stone maces, earspools, and necklace beads (all of which are motifs identified with the \"falcon dancer/warrior/chunkey player\" mythological figure). Artifacts made from these marine shells have been found as far north as Wisconsin and as far west as Oklahoma. Several examples of cups from Moundville and Spiro have been found to have rings of black residue in the bottoms, suggesting they were used for black drink rituals. Many examples of shell cups found in Mississippian culture mounds are engraved with S.E.C.C. imagery. A few examples portray what is theorized to be black drink rituals, including what some anthropologists have interpreted as vomit issuing from the mouths of mythological beings.\n\nPottery samples recovered from sites in modern Southwestern United States and Northwestern Mexico have tested positive for the ratio of methylxanthines associated with those produced by \"Ilex vomitoria\". The same study also identified methylxanthines ratios associated with \"Theobroma cacao\". Neither plants are native to the areas from which the pottery samples were recovered, which suggests trading between areas where those plants are native. The chemical analysis also suggests a possible increase in drinks prepared from cacao after the year 1200, and a decrease in the use of drinks prepared from \"Ilex vomitoria\". Freshwater shells from Texas and Arkansas have been recovered from Pueblo Bonito, which have been used as possible evidence for the trade of \"Ilex vomitoria\" from the east. There are also some stands of \"Ilex vomitoria\" in Mesoamerica, so the exact origins of the \"Ilex vomitoria\" used to prepare the drinks is currently unknown.\n\nA number of tribes across the Southeastern United States use a form of the black drink in their ceremonies. Muscogee Creeks, Cherokees, Choctaws, Ais, Guale, Chickasaws, Chitimacha, Timucua and others are documented users of a type of black drink. Although rituals vary amongst the different tribes, there are some common traits among them. Black drink is most commonly drunk by men, who also prepare it, but there are some accounts of its preparation and use by women among some groups. Removal of tribes to areas outside the natural range of \"Ilex vomitoria\" has been partially responsible for a decline in the preparation of the black drink among present Native Americans.\n\nIn 1696, Jonathan Dickinson witnessed the use of a beverage brewed from the Yaupon Holly among the Ais of Florida. Dickinson later learned that the Spanish called the plant \"casseena\". The Ais parched the leaves in a pot, and then boiled them. The resulting liquid was then transferred to a large bowl using a gourd that had a long neck with a small hole at the top, and a hole in the side. On the occasion Dickinson witnessed, he estimated that there were nearly three gallons of the beverage in the bowl. After the liquid had cooled, the chief was presented with a conch-shell of the beverage. The chief threw part of it on the ground as a blessing and drank the rest. The chief's associates were then served in turn. Lower status men, women, and children were not allowed to touch or taste the beverage. The chief and his associates sat drinking this brew, smoking and talking for most of the day. In the evening, the bowl that had held the beverage was covered with a skin to make a drum. The Ais, accompanied by the drum and some rattles, sang and danced until the middle of the night.\n\nCherokee black drink is taken for purification at several traditional ceremonies. Made with emetics, the complete recipe is not shared with the public. The black drink induces vomiting for purification purposes. Other ritual medicinal beverages are also used in the ceremonies. \"Ilex vomitoria\" was not native to the traditional area controlled by the Cherokee before removal, but it was brought in to the area through trade and then transplanted.\n\nAmong the Muscogee the black drink is called \"ássi\". In the ceremonies of some cultures that use the drink, after its preparation it is passed out to the highest-status person first, then the next highest status, and so forth. During each person's turn to drink, ritual songs may be sung. Its use was traditionally limited to only adult men. The ritual name \"Asi Yahola\" or \"Black Drink Singer\" is corrupted into English as \"Osceola\").\n\nAmong the Timucua, a type of black drink was called \"cacina\" by the Spanish. The preparation and consumption of the drink were strictly limited to the community council house. Women (other than an occasional female chief) were normally excluded from the council house except for activities such as dances, but did prepare the \"cacina\". In 1678 a bedridden \"cacica\" (a female chief) was given permission to brew and consume \"cacina\" in her house, on the condition that no one else could be present while she did so.\n\nAfter European contact with tribes in what is today the Southeastern United States, colonists began using the charred leaves of the yaupon holly to make a tea similar to the black drink, but without the ritual vomiting of it. Its use by colonists in Spanish Florida is documented as far back as 1615. An account from that year describes Spaniards as experiencing symptoms that would now be described as caffeine dependence due to daily consumption of what they called \"cacina\" or \"té del indio\". The use of \"Ilex vomitoria\" by colonists for tea making and for medicinal uses in the Carolinas is documented by the early eighteenth century. In the English-speaking colonies, it was known variously as cassina, yaupon tea, Indian tea, Carolina tea, and Appalachian tea. It was commonly believed to be and used as a diuretic. By the late 1700s, yaupon tea was described as being more commonly used in North Carolina at breakfast than tea made with \"Camellia sinensis\". In addition to using it on their own, Spanish and British colonist often drank black drink when engaging in discussions and treaties with Natives. Its preparation by British and Spanish colonists was nearly identical to the method of preparation used by their Native neighbors. Its use by colonists in French Louisiana is speculated to have occurred, but lacks documentation other than one source describing its medicinal uses from 1716.\n\nDuring the Civil War, yaupon tea was used as a substitute for coffee and tea throughout the South. Yaupon continued to be used in North Carolina for medicinal purposes and as a common drink until the late 1890s. At that point, its use was stigmatized because of its natural abundance as being a habit associated with rural poor people. By 1928 it was described as only being in common use on Knotts Island, North Carolina. During the Interwar period the United States Department of Agriculture investigated the use of cassina tea as a substitute for coffee and tea. There were also a few attempts at the commercialization of cassina tea during that same period. By 1973 it was believed that cassina tea was only being served at the Pony Island Restaurant on Ocracoke Island, North Carolina. In the early 2000s yaupon tea began witnessing a resurgence in its popularity, and can now be purchased online and at several historical sites related to Native Americans.\n\n\n\n"}

The Shia Family Law legislation was signed into law by President Hamid Karzai in March 2009 after intense pressure from Shia clerics including Mohseni and some leaders of the Hazara community. It gives Shiite men in Afghanistan wide-ranging powers over their wives. Shiite women must obtain permission from their husbands to leave their houses, “except in extreme circumstances.” The law also grants guardianship of children exclusively to their fathers and grandfathers.\n\nThe passing of the law brought international outrage and was condemned by world leaders including US President Barack Obama. A report by the United Nations Development Fund for Women, UNIFEM, warned: \"Article 132 legalises the rape of a wife by her husband\".\n\nOn 15 April 2009, between 200-300 Afghan women protested against the law outside Mohseni's mosque and seminary. They were met by hundreds of his enraged supporters who shouted abuse and, according to many of the demonstrators, threw stones at the women.

He developed the coal and iron industries across South Wales and built the Cardiff Docks.\n\nBute's father, John, Lord Mount Stuart, died a few months after he was born and as a young child he was brought up first by his mother, the former Lady Elizabeth McDougall-Crichton, and later by his paternal grandfather, John Stuart, 1st Marquess of Bute. He travelled widely across Europe before attending Cambridge University. He contracted an eye condition and remained partially sighted for the rest of his life. Having inherited large estates across Britain, he married his first wife, Lady Maria North, in 1818, and together they lived a relatively secluded life in Mount Stuart House in Scotland, one of Bute's four seats. Bute was dour but industrious, with a flair for land management. He focused his daily routine around extensive correspondence with his estate managers, making biennial tours of his lands around the country. The couple did not conceive any children, and Maria died in 1841. Bute remarried four years later, to Lady Sophia Rawdon-Hastings, and she gave birth to Bute's only child, John, in 1847.\n\nBute was a member of the House of Lords and controlled the votes of several members of the House of Commons. He was a political and religious conservative, a follower of the Duke of Wellington, but rarely took part in national debates unless his own commercial interests were involved. Early on, Bute realised the vast wealth that lay in the South Wales coalfields and set about commercially exploiting them through local ironmasters and colliers. He constructed the Cardiff Docks, a major project which, despite running heavily over budget, enabled further exports of iron and coal and magnified the value of his lands in Glamorganshire. When violence broke out in the Merthyr Rising of 1831, Bute led the government response from Cardiff Castle, despatching military forces, deploying spies and keeping Whitehall informed throughout. The contemporary press praised the marquess as \"the creator of modern Cardiff\", and on his death he left vast wealth to his son.\n\nBute was the son of John, Lord Mount Stuart, and the former Lady Elizabeth McDouall-Crichton. His parents were both from wealthy, aristocratic backgrounds; his father was due to become the Marquess of Bute, with extensive landholdings in Scotland and in South Wales, and his mother was the sole heir to the Crichton estates, with over of land in Scotland. Bute's father died in a riding accident in February 1794, leaving Elizabeth to give birth to Bute's younger brother, Patrick Stuart, later that year.\nInitially Bute was brought up at Dumfries House by his mother and grandmother, but following their deaths he passed into the care of his grandfather, the 1st Marquess of Bute, and travelled with him across England and Europe. His family considered him to be clever and he went to study at Christ's College in Cambridge in 1809. Over the next few years he visited the Mediterranean, Scandinavia and Russia, taking a keen interest in land economics. He developed an eye condition during this period and became partially blind, leaving him unable to travel without assistance or to tolerate bright lights, and finding it difficult to read or write.\n\nHis maternal grandfather, Lord Dumfries, died in 1803, followed by his paternal grandfather in 1814, with Bute inheriting both sets of estates and adding Crichton to his surname after Lord Dumfries. As a consequence he held many hereditary titles and posts: in addition to being the Marquess of Bute, he was also the Earl of Windsor, Viscount Mountjoy, Baron Mount Stuart, Baron Cardiff, the Earl of Dumfries and Bute, the Viscount of Ayr and Kingarth, Baron Crichton, Lord Crichton of Sanquhar and Cumnock, and Lord Mount Stuart Cumra and Inchmarnock, and a Baronet of Nova Scotia. He was the Keeper of Rothsay Castle, the Lord Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum of Glamorgan, the Lord Lieutenant, the hereditary Sheriff and Coroner of Buteshire, and the High Steward of Banbury.\n\nBute had four major seats, Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute, Dumfries House in Ayrshire, Luton Hoo in Bedfordshire, and Cardiff Castle in South Wales, with his London townhouse on Campden Hill in Kensington. Bute preferred to live in Mount Stuart House; he disliked London and only spent a few weeks in Cardiff Castle each year. Twice each year he would travel from Mount Stuart House through Ayrshire to Edinburgh, down through northern England to London, and on to Cardiff and his South Wales estates. In November 1843, a fire swept through Luton Hoo House, destroying the interior; the house's historic library survived, however, and most of its famous collection of paintings were rescued from the blaze; it was subsequently sold off by Bute.\nConcerned about his growing blindness, and not enjoying the social life in London, Bute retired to his estates on the Isle of Bute for the next six years. While recovering, Bute married his first wife, Lady Maria North, in 1818. Maria was one of the three daughters of the 3rd Earl of Guilford, and a wealthy heiress. £40,000 was settled on her at the time of her marriage and she was due to inherit a third of her father's extensive estates. Contemporaries considered Maria a kind and pleasant woman, but she was often unwell and the marriage proved childless. In 1820 his portrait was painted by Henry Raeburn, and published two years later as an engraving by William Ward. In 1827 his father-in-law died and Maria inherited lands worth over £110,000.\n\nThe historian John Davies describes Bute as \"dour, remote and overbearing on first acquaintance\" but with a \"sense of responsibility, considerable imagination and an enormous capacity for hard work\". By the aristocratic standards of the day, Bute lived a reclusive lifestyle. As a result of his personality and poor eyesight, he did not enjoy hunting, shooting, or large social gatherings, nor did he like racehorses or gambling. His first wife's illnesses added to this sense of exclusion from wider aristocratic society. Compared to other landowners of the period, Bute was relatively philanthropic, giving away around seven to eight percent of his rental income from South Wales in charitable donations, for example. He was keen to fund local schools and to construct new churches, partially because in doing so he was able to discourage any moves towards Nonconformism and the disestablishment of the official Church.\n\nIn 1841 Lady Maria died, and Bute blamed his excessive focus on the dock programme for exacerbating his wife's illness. As a result of the original marriage agreement, Bute continued to draw the incomes from his late wife's property for the remainder of his life, even though officially the estates would ultimately pass to Maria's sister, Lady Susan, on his own death. He was created a Knight of the Thistle in 1843 by Queen Victoria. In 1845 Bute fell from his horse and injured his eyes further in the accident, making it still harder for him to read and write. Bute remarried the same year, this time to Lady Sophia Rawdon-Hastings, the daughter of the Marquess of Hastings. Sophia was obsessive, hard to please and did not get on well with John's family, especially his brother. She soon became pregnant, but gave birth to a stillborn child; the couple's second child, whom they named John, was successfully born in 1847.\n\nBute's relationship with his brother Patrick was often difficult. Their political views did not coincide, as Patrick was much more liberal than Bute and favoured political reform. Although Bute arranged for Patrick to become a Member of Parliament in 1818, in 1831 their differing views resulted in Bute removing him from Parliament. For many years, Patrick had good reason to expect that Bute would die childless, leaving him to inherit the family estates; after Bute's death, he disputed the occupancy of Cardiff Castle with Lady Sophia.\n\nBute was determined to develop his different estates and receive the best possible return from them. He was an active, ambitious manager, quick to generate new ideas for the properties, and spent the majority of his time managing his properties . Despite his poor eyesight, he wrote at least six letters to his managers each day. He had a detailed understanding of his various estates and businesses; he attempted to keep up with affairs in Glamorgan, for example, by reading the local Welsh newspapers from his house in Scotland and through exchanging letters with influential local figures. Bute recognised that his land holdings were too extended and disparate to be easily managed and attempted to rationalise them. He attempted to sell his Luton estates in the early 1820s but failed to obtain an adequate price; he successfully sold them in the early 1840s. Luton and Luton Hoo was finally sold in 1845, by then comprising around .\n\nUnusually for an aristocrat of the period, Bute owned almost all of his lands fully, as an owner in fee simple, rather than having his rights diluted through arrangements with trustees. When he married in 1818, Bute placed his English and Wales estates into a trustee arrangement for any future children, but this agreement expired with Lady Maria's death in 1842; when he remarried in 1845 a similar trustee agreement was set up, although in this version the Glamorgan estates were administered separately from his other holdings in England and Wales. Bute continued to run his network of estates and estate managers personally, helped by Onesipherus Bruce, a barrister-agent and close friend.\n\nAs early as 1815, Bute had his Glamorgan estates fully surveyed, which highlighted that the estates had been neglected for many years and were now in a poor condition. Edward Richards became the senior official in charge of the estates by 1824 and represented Bute on both estate and political affairs across the region. Despite this, Bute retained the final authority over even quite minor issues on the estates, including making decisions on the buttons to be used on local school uniforms or the reuse of a broken flag pole, for example, which could result in considerable delays as letters were sent between South Wales and Scotland. As the complexity of the Glamorgan estates grew, more officials were appointed to help manage the docks, farms and mineral interests, but these all reported separately to Bute, putting increasing pressure on the marquess.\n\nOn the Isle of Bute, the marquess expanded his properties, purchasing land in Ascog, Kilmahalmag and Etterick Mill.\n\nBute was closely involved in the developments across Glamorganshire during the first half of the 19th century. The region saw tremendous economic and social changes in a short period. The population almost trebled in the first forty years of the century and industrial outputs soared, with the output of pig iron increasing from 34,000 to 277,000 tons between 1796 and 1830. Industry and mining replaced agriculture as the main sources of work. In driving forward and responding to these changes, Bute transformed his South Wales estate into a major industrial enterprise.\n\nBute's land holdings in Glamorgan were spread out across the county and he took steps to consolidate them, selling around of some of the outlying properties in the west and investing heavily in buying of land around Cardiff between 1814 and 1826. The rising prices of land and the costs of the docks brought an end to this expansion. Estimating the profitability of the Glamorgan estates is challenging because of the way that the accounts were drawn up during the period, but estimates suggest that once land purchases and the dock building cost were factored in, the estates cost the marquess much more than they delivered in income. Bute borrowed heavily; he had inherited debts of £62,500, but by the time of his death owed £493,887. Financing and supporting this debt was difficult, particularly during the early 1840s, when credit was hard to come by, and John was forced to juggle lenders and different lines of credit. He believed that ultimately his investments would provide a rich return, and in 1844 noted that he thought \"well of the prospects of my income in the distance\".\nThe economic growth across South Wales drove up the demand for new housing for the growing workforce. Bute was not prepared to sell any of his lands for housing, and did not see much profit in building and renting housing himself, but was prepared to lease land in the growing urban areas and mining communities for land development. Initially, he attempted to negotiate 63 year long leases, which would have given his successors additional, early flexibility in how they managed the land, but these proved unpopular so he reverted to offering the more typical 99-year leases. None of the contracts offered by Bute allowed the lessee to buy the freehold or automatically renew the lease at the end of this term, which ultimately resulted in substantial political difficulties for the third and fourth marquesses when there was a storm of complaints in the late 19th and early 20th century. Bute left the style of the early developments up to the lessees, but was concerned by the poor results. Bute then began to approve the designs for new buildings personally, laying out some grand streets in the centre of Cardiff and retaining open areas for eventual use as parks. Very little money was invested in the sewage and drainage systems for his new developments, however, and a damning 1850 inquiry showed that this had resulted in cholera outbreaks across the town.\n\nAt the start of the 19th century, scientific investigation began to indicate that the Glamorgan valleys were rich with coal deposits. Bute, who already owned coal mines in County Durham, commissioned further surveys in 1817 and 1823–24 which showed that there were potentially huge profits to be made from the reserves, both from the coal sitting beneath Bute's own lands, but also from the coal under common lands in the region that Bute could claim through his feudal titles. Bute set about consolidating his rights and existing investments during the late 1820s and 1830s, acquiring extensive rights to the coalfields in the process. Bute established and managed a few colleries – such as that at Rhigos – directly, but given the investment costs and attention they took up, generally preferred to lease out his coal fields and claim a royalty on the coal mined instead. The lessees might be iron-masters, who used the coal in their own operations, or colliery owners who sold the coal on to industrial or domestic customers. The profits increased from £872 in the second half of 1826, to £10,756 in 1848–49.\n\nBetween 1822 and 1848 Bute played a central role in the creation of the Cardiff Docks. The idea was first put forward to Bute by one of his staff in 1822, who suggested that, with the right investment, Cardiff could be transformed into a major port for exporting coal and iron. The existing seaport, used by the Glamorganshire Canal, was small and inefficient. The new port would then deliver a direct return to Bute from shipping rates, improve the value of his lands in Cardiff itself and increase the value of the royalties he could charge on his coal fields. Initially Bute opposed plans for docks put forward by the local ironmasters, but then changed his mind and pushed forward with his own scheme shortly afterward.\n\nThe first phase was to build a new dock and connecting canal in Cardiff, making the Glamorganshire Canal redundant in the process, at an estimated cost of £66,600, considered to opponents to be a \"wild speculation\". Parliamentary permission was acquired in 1830, despite opposition from the local canal companies of iron masters. The project proved more complex than originally planned, driving Bute to become irritable and angry with almost all of his associates, but the dock opened successfully in 1839. The costs of building the docks had been far more than anticipated, however. Instead of the original estimate, construction costs had soared to £350,000, reaching £10,000 a month in 1837. Bute had to mortgage his local estates to raise the sums required to finish the project. To make matters worse, when they first opened the docks did not receive the traffic he had expected, particularly from the larger ships; Bute put this down to a coalition of ironmasters and others intent on ruining him.\n\nBute responded by putting commercial pressure on shipping companies to abandon the Glamorganshire Canal and using his feudal rights to force shippers to move their wharfs to his docks. His efforts paid off and although trade through the docks only came to 8,000 tons in 1839, they then rose quickly, reaching 827,000 tons by 1849. Between 1841 and 1848 the docks brought in a gross income of just under £68,000, a relatively disappointing figure compared to the size of the investment. Successive marquesses would find themselves under huge pressure to continue investing and expanding in the docks and subsequent phases of construction over the coming decades.\n\nBute was born into the pre-Reform system of government in Britain. The British Parliament was divided into the hereditary House of Lords and the elected House of Commons, but voting systems varied widely across England and in many cases only very small numbers of local people were enfranchised to vote. Some members of the House of Lords, termed \"patrons\", often controlled these \"closed\" or \"nominated\" seats in the Commons, effectively appointing their own candidates. Criticism of the system, led by the Whigs, grew during the first half of Bute's life.\n\nBute was a member of the House of Lords, able to vote on national affairs, but he had a reputation for not attending unless to vote on acts relating to his estates or business interests. When he did vote, it was usually as a moderate conservative, and Bute himself described himself as a follower of the Duke of Wellington, by then a leading Tory politician. John was in favour of Catholic Emancipation, opposed to slavery, the New Poor Law and the Game Laws. Like Wellington, he was in favour of repealing the Corn Laws. He passionately opposed electoral reform, however, and any attempts to disestablish the Church of England or Scotland. Bute had strong views on the necessity of encouraging the poor to work, and was in favour of removing the Irish poor from the mainland back to Ireland. He was a notoriously poor public speaker.\n\nIn addition to his personal role in Parliament, Bute sought to control the votes of members of the House of Commons, primarily to ensure the passage of legislation affecting his business interests. Initially, the Isle of Bute had only 21 voters who were dominated by his private estate, but it only returned a Member of Parliament in alternate elections, and his estates in Luton were too limited to allow him to influence the electoral process there. The best remaining option for Bute was to control the voting in Cardiff, but even here he had to choose his candidate carefully and apply careful financial pressure through his control of leases and rents to ensure their election.\n\nIn 1832 the Reform Act was passed by Parliament, widening the electorate across the country. The Isle of Bute's electorate rose to 300 and acquired a permanent Member of Parliament, still controlled by Bute. Cardiff saw a short-term drop in its electorate as a result of the act, and Bute benefited from the granting of the vote to many of his richer agricultural tenants. In the aftermath of the reforms, Bute secretly sponsored the creation of the conservative newspaper the \"Glamorgan Monmouth and Brecon Gazette and Merthyr Guardian\", to increase support across the county, and underwrote its losses for many years.\n\nFrom 1842 to 1846 he acted as Her Majesty's High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. He was known for his generosity as a host in this role. He was in office during the schism in the Church of Scotland known as \"the Disruption\", when many many ministers of the Church broke away from the established Church to form the Free Church. Bute took a firm line on the matter: when his head-gardener at Mount Stuart House joined the Free Church, he was immediately sacked, and when the minister at one of Bute's churches in the north of the island attempted to hold a Free Church ceremony there, Bute demanded the keys to the church be returned and had the property closed up.\n\nBute was determined to control the local government around Cardiff, considering it part of his rights and duties as a major landowner and aristocrat. On inheriting his estates, however, he found himself facing a difficult political situation. The Butes' grip on Glamorganshire had been weakened in the late 18th century, and the management of their political interests had been left for many years in the hands of John Wood, a local solicitor, whose family was embroiled in local politics, with their own set of interests. Glamorgan was also politically split between factions in the west and the east of the county, with most of Bute's estates in the eastern half. Bute's residence in the area, Cardiff Castle, was understaffed and regarded as unsuitable as a residence; consequently, he lacked the easy local patronage that would have come with a major, properly functioning establishment.\n\nThere were tensions between Bute and the new industrialists around the region, including ironmasters such as John Guest, the master of the Dowlais Ironworks. Bute was a financial competitor or landlord with many of these men, and keen to drive as good a deal as possible in his negotiations with them. He also had political differences, seeing himself as a benevolent feudal lord in South Wales, and perceiving the local iron-masters as arrogant, power-hungry individuals, abusing their economic power towards communities and workers.\n\nNonetheless, Bute was able to personally appoint the Constable of Cardiff Castle, and the constable by law acted as the effective mayor of Cardiff, ran the town's council and had wide powers when appointing local officials. He inherited the title of Lord-Lieutenant of the county in 1815, giving him the right to recommend the appointments of new magistrates and various other civic posts; potential candidates for these posts were advised to vote for Bute's representatives at elections. In 1825 he became the colonel in chief of the Royal Glamorgan Militia, and used this authority to instruct the militia to vote for his candidates. Those who publicly voted against Bute faced charitable donations and support being cut off. His later control of the Cardiff Docks also helped to provide patronage and influence voting behaviour.\n\nIn 1817, John Wood died in the midst of a financial scandal, and Bute decided to appoint two of his rivals to the posts of Constable and Cardiff's Town Clerk. This would have reaffirmed Bute's power to change the appointments and broken the Wood's family hold on local power, but it provoked a storm of local political wrangling. The Wood family turned on Bute, arguing that he should abandon his claims to control local Welsh affairs from Scotland. Bute replied by trying to crush the Wood family's bank and stacking the town council with his appointees in early 1818. The Woods successfully took legal action, challenging Bute's authority to take these actions, and anti-Bute violence flared that summer, resulting in arrests by Special Constables appointed by Bute. The pro-Bute faction in Cardiff rallied and the Woods were defeated at the Parliamentary elections that year, the results reaffirming Bute's authority over the town council.\n\nBute played a role in the event of the Merthyr Rising, a large, armed industrial protest that occurred in Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales in 1831. \nPolitical tensions amongst the working classes in Glamorgan had grown during the 1820s: although wages were impressive by contemporary standards during good years, they deteriorated quickly during depressions, plunging many into destitution; sanitation and health standards in the fast-growing industrial communities were appalling, child mortality rates were extremely high. 1831 saw a severe economic depression, with wages falling quickly and food prices rising, and complaints against the local debt courts and their bailiffs were numerous. Nationally, the electoral reform movement was making considerable protests and protests against the Corn Laws—which kept the prices of food high—were growing. In South Wales, several of the major ironmasters were associated with these movements, promoting reform under the Whig administration voted into power between April and June 1831.\n\nBy late 1830, and certainly by the spring of 1831, trouble in South Wales looked likely and, probably in response, Bute broke from his normal annual plans and in May travelled south from Scotland to Cardiff Castle. With a reform bill looking likely, tensions grew between the different political factions in Glamorganshire and how the potential new parliamentary seats should be shared out, especially between Bute and his conservative allies, Crawshay and Guest. Radical demonstrations occurred in Merthyr Tydfil, one of the largest industrial communities, in May, and the crowd set light to effigies of conservative politicians. Violence broke out and arrests were made on 10 May; the prisoners were released by the angry crowd and the local authorities effectively lost any control of the town. A general insurrection ensued on 30 May.\n\nTwo local magistrates, J. Bruce and Anthony Hill, were stranded in the Castle Inn in Merthyr Tydfil. They swore in around 70 men as special constables, but they were heavily outnumbered by the radical crowds. Bruce wrote an urgent letter to Bute in Cardiff Castle, asking for urgent advice on whether to call in the armed forces, and querying whether the Marquess had readied the Militia for action. Huge crowds marched on the local iron works, stopping production. The messages from Merthyr Tydfil reached Bute that afternoon, who began to assemble the Eastern and Central Yeomanry militia units and transport ready for deployment. Bute paused until the morning, hoping to hear better news, but messengers bought more desperate news from Bruce and Hill, and the Yeomanry were dispatched. Meanwhile, an 80-man unit of the 93rd Foot had arrived in the Castle Inn from Brecon. Bute continued to keep Whitehall informed of the events by letter throughout.\n\nOn the morning of 3 May, the 93rd Foot reached the Castle Inn, where the magistrates had been joined by the established figures of the town, deputised as constables, including the High Sheriff and most of the ironmasters. Outside, the radical crowds had grown to an estimated number of between 7,000 and 10,000. Tensions rose alarmingly and the Riot Act was read in English and Welsh. Violence flared, the crowds attempted to seize the soldiers' weapons and the soldiers responded with volleys of musket fire. The town's working classes exploded in anger and set about searching the region for weapons. A messenger escaped the inn to reach Bute in Cardiff, who set about mobilising all the remaining armed forces he had available. Bute also despatched Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Morgan of the Militia into Merthyr to replace the commander of the 93rd Foot who had been badly injured.\n\nThe men in the Castle Inn retreated to Penydarren House, who were joined by the initial reinforcements from the Yeomanry, bringing the establishment's numbers to around 300, not all of them were armed and able to fight. They faced increasingly well-armed insurgents and Bute became increasingly concerned about the quality of the opposition facing his men. Bute sent spies into the insurgency, and nearby Cyfarthfa Castle was pressed into service as an observation post. Bute mobilised military pensioners, and used them to start to bring Penydarren House additional weaponry from Cardiff; he was advised to be careful, however, in case the shipments fell into the hands of the insurgency. Morgan's forces were able to prevent the radical crowds from entering either Penydarren or Cyfartha, and Bute arrested potential insurgents in Cardiff.\n\nOn 16 May, Morgan was in a position to advance in force into Merthyr, pushing forward and taking advantage of the poor communications between the various elements of the insurgency. The uprising collapsed, and over the next few days the authorities regained control, making arrests and forcing the workers back to business. Government inquiries into the incident began and Bute, among others, provided analysis and reports to Whitehall. In the aftermath, Richard Lewis, one of the radical crowd, was hanged in Cardiff. The execution proved controversial and it is unknown whether Bute, who had by then left to attend Parliament in London, approved of the decision.\n\nConcerns over possible violent outbreaks continued for many years. Chartism became prominent in the region in the late 1830s, again causing Bute considerable worries in 1839 and leading to him encouraging the mobilisation of military forces to deal with the threat. Bute began to advocate the creation of a police force to suppress the problems in the northern valleys, for once allying himself with the local ironmasters to overcome rural opposition to the scheme. In 1841 the scheme was passed by the Glamorgan magistrates, with a chief constable and headquarters established that year.\n\nIn 1835 an act of Parliament reformed the local government structure, introducing a new town corporation structure with an elected mayor for the first time. Bute had to work harder to maintain his influence over the new corporation, using the various levers of influence at his disposal. He was successful, and in practice the elected officials and councillors were controlled by Bute and his interests.\n\nBute died in Cardiff on 18 March 1848, and was buried in Kirtling, alongside Maria, his first wife. His funeral had 31 carriages in attendance and drew large crowds, although his funeral was snubbed by the local ironmasters. The national press gave his death little coverage, but the local \"Daily Chronicle\" noted Bute's unusual achievement in building up the industrial base of his South Wales estates, and particularly praised his role in constructing the Cardiff Docks. The Cardiff Docks, whose opening in 1837 had led the press to praise Bute as \"the creator of modern Cardiff\", continued to transform the city over the rest of the century. They would also form a financial liability to Bute successors, the costs of the continual investment needed to maintain and grow the facilities partially off-setting the huge profits that Bute's son enjoyed from the South Wales coalfields.\n\nA subscription was raised across Glamorgan to pay for a statue to be made of him, which was erected in Cardiff's High Street in 1853, outside the town hall. In 2000 the statue, Cardiff's oldest, was moved to Bute Square, but the location was renamed Callaghan Square in 2002, leading to proposals from local officials that Bute's statue might be better relocated once again, potentially to outside Cardiff Castle.\n\n"}

{"id": "1886691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1886691", "title": "Theory of Colours", "text": "Theory of Colours\n\nTheory of Colours (German: \"Zur Farbenlehre\") is a book by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe about the poet's views on the nature of colours and how these are perceived by humans. It was published in German in 1810 and in English in 1840. The book contains detailed descriptions of phenomena such as coloured shadows, refraction, and chromatic aberration.\n\nThe work originated in Goethe's occupation with painting and mainly exerted an influence on the arts (Philipp Otto Runge, J. M. W. Turner, the Pre-Raphaelites, Wassily Kandinsky). The book is a successor to two short essays entitled \"Contributions to Optics\".\n\nAlthough Goethe's work was rejected by physicists, a number of philosophers and physicists have concerned themselves with it, including Thomas Johann Seebeck, Arthur Schopenhauer (see: \"On Vision and Colors\"), Hermann von Helmholtz, Rudolf Steiner, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Werner Heisenberg, Kurt Gödel, and Mitchell Feigenbaum.\n\nGoethe's book provides a catalogue of how colour is perceived in a wide variety of circumstances, and considers Isaac Newton's observations to be special cases. Unlike Newton, Goethe's concern was not so much with the analytic treatment of colour, as with the qualities of how phenomena are perceived. Philosophers have come to understand the distinction between the optical spectrum, as observed by Newton, and the phenomenon of human colour perception as presented by Goethe—a subject analyzed at length by Wittgenstein in his comments on Goethe's theory in \"Remarks on Colour\".\n\nAt Goethe's time, it was generally acknowledged that, as Isaac Newton had shown in his \"Opticks\" in 1704, colourless (white) light is split up into its component colours when directed through a prism.\n\nGoethe's starting point was the supposed discovery of how Newton erred in the prismatic experiment, and by 1793 Goethe had formulated his arguments against Newton in the essay \"Über Newtons Hypothese der diversen Refrangibilität\" (\"\"On Newton's hypothesis of diverse refrangibility\"\"). Yet, by 1794, Goethe had begun to increasingly note the importance of the physiological aspect of colours.\n\nAs Goethe notes in the historical section, Louis Bertrand Castel had already published a criticism of Newton's spectral description of prismatic colour in 1740 in which he observed that the sequence of colours split by a prism depended on the distance from the prism—and that Newton was looking at a special case.\n\n\"Whereas Newton observed the colour spectrum cast on a wall at a fixed distance away from the prism, Goethe observed the cast spectrum on a white card which was progressively moved away from the prism... As the card was moved away, the projected image elongated, gradually assuming an elliptical shape, and the coloured images became larger, finally merging at the centre to produce green. Moving the card farther led to the increase in the size of the image, until finally the spectrum described by Newton in the Opticks was produced... The image cast by the refracted beam was not fixed, but rather developed with increasing distance from the prism. Consequently, Goethe saw the particular distance chosen by Newton to prove the second proposition of the Opticks as capriciously imposed.\" (Alex Kentsis, Between Light and Eye)\n\nIn the preface to the \"Theory of Colours\", Goethe explained that he tried to apply the principle of \"polarity\", in the work—a proposition that belonged to his earliest convictions and was constitutive of his entire study of nature.\n\nIt is hard to present Goethe's \"theory\", since he refrains from setting up any actual theory; he says, \"its intention is to portray rather than explain\" (\"Scientific Studies\"). Instead of setting up models and explanations, Goethe collected specimens—he was responsible for the meteorological collections of Jena University. By the time of his death, he had amassed over 17,800 minerals in his personal collection—the largest in all of Europe. He took the same approach to colour—instead of narrowing and isolating things to a single 'experimentum crucis' (or critical experiment that would prove or disprove his theory), he sought to gain as much breadth for his understanding as possible by developing a wide-ranging exposition through which is revealed the essential character of colour—without having to resort to explanations and theories about perceived phenomena such as 'wavelengths' or 'particles'.\n\n\"The crux of his color theory is its experiential source: rather than impose theoretical statements, Goethe sought to allow light and color to be displayed in an ordered series of experiments that readers could experience for themselves.\" (Seamon, 1998). According to Goethe, \"Newton's error.. was trusting math over the sensations of his eye.\" (Jonah Lehrer, 2006).\n\nTo stay true to the perception without resort to explanation was the essence of Goethe's method. What he provided was really not so much a theory, as a \"rational description\" of colour. For Goethe, \"the highest is to understand that all fact is really theory. The blue of the sky reveals to us the basic law of color. Search nothing beyond the phenomena, they themselves are the theory.\"\n\nGoethe outlines his method in the essay, \"The experiment as mediator between subject and object\" (1772). It underscores his experiential standpoint. \"The human being himself, to the extent that he makes sound use of his senses, is the most exact physical apparatus that can exist.\" (Goethe, \"Scientific Studies\")\n\nUnlike his contemporaries, Goethe didn't see darkness as an absence of light, but rather as polar to and interacting with light; colour resulted from this interaction of light and shadow. For Goethe, light is \"\"the simplest most undivided most homogeneous being that we know. Confronting it is the darkness\"\" (Letter to Jacobi).\n\nBased on his experiments with turbid media, Goethe characterized colour as arising from the dynamic interplay of darkness and light. Rudolf Steiner, the science editor for the Kurschner edition of Goethe's works, gave the following analogy:\n\nGoethe expresses this more succinctly:\n\nIn other words: Yellow is a light which has been dampened by darkness; Blue is a darkness weakened by light.\n\nGoethe's studies of colour began with experiments which examined the effects of turbid media, such as air, dust, and moisture on the perception of light and dark. The poet observed that light seen through a turbid medium appears yellow, and darkness seen through an illuminated medium appears blue.\n\nHe then proceeds with numerous experiments, systematically observing the effects of rarefied mediums such as dust, air, and moisture on the perception of colour.\n\nWhen viewed through a prism, the orientation of a light–dark boundary with respect to the prism's axis is significant. With white above a dark boundary, we observe the light extending a blue-violet edge into the dark area; whereas dark above a light boundary results in a red-yellow edge extending into the light area.\n\nGoethe was intrigued by this difference. He felt that this arising of colour at light–dark boundaries was fundamental to the creation of the spectrum (which he considered to be a compound phenomenon).\n\nVarying the experimental conditions by using different shades of grey shows that the intensity of coloured edges increases with boundary contrast.\n\nSince the colour phenomenon relies on the adjacency of light and dark, there are two ways to produce a spectrum: with a light beam in a dark room, and with a dark beam (i.e., a shadow) in a light room.\n\nGoethe recorded the sequence of colours projected at various distances from a prism for both cases (see Plate IV, \"Theory of Colours\"). In both cases, he found that the yellow and blue edges remain closest to the side which is light, and red and violet edges remain closest to the side which is dark. At a certain distance, these edges overlap—and we obtain Newton's spectrum. When these edges overlap in a light spectrum, green results; when they overlap in a dark spectrum, magenta results.\n\nWith a light spectrum (i.e. a shaft of light in a surrounding darkness), we find yellow-red colours along the top edge, and blue-violet colours along the bottom edge. The spectrum with green in the middle arises only where the blue-violet edges overlap the yellow-red edges. Unfortunately an optical mixture of blue and yellow gives white, not green, and so Goethe's explanation of Newton's spectrum fails.\n\nWith a dark spectrum (i.e., a shadow surrounded by light), we find violet-blue along the top edge, and red-yellow along the bottom edge—and where these edges overlap, we find (extraspectral) magenta.\n\nOlaf Müller presented the matter in the following way, \"According to Newton, all spectral colors are contained in white sunlight, according to Goethe, the opposite can be said — that all colors of the complementary spectrum are contained in the dark.\" \n\nGoethe anticipated Ewald Hering's Opponent process theory by proposing a symmetric colour wheel. He writes, \"The chromatic circle... [is] arranged in a general way according to the natural order... for the colours diametrically opposed to each other in this diagram are those which reciprocally evoke each other in the eye. Thus, yellow demands violet; orange [demands] blue; purple [demands] green; and vice versa: thus... all intermediate gradations reciprocally evoke each other; the simpler colour demanding the compound, and vice versa ( paragraph #50).\n\nIn the same way that light and dark spectra yielded green from the mixture of blue and yellow—Goethe completed his colour wheel by recognising the importance of magenta—\"For Newton, only spectral colors could count as fundamental. By contrast, Goethe's more empirical approach led him to recognize the essential role of magenta in a complete color circle, a role that it still has in all modern color systems.\"\n\nGoethe also included aesthetic qualities in his colour wheel, under the title of \"allegorical, symbolic, mystic use of colour\" (\"Allegorischer, symbolischer, mystischer Gebrauch der Farbe\"), establishing a kind of color psychology.\nHe associated red with the \"beautiful\", orange with the \"noble\", yellow to the \"good\", green to the \"useful\", blue to the \"common\", and violet to the \"unnecessary\".\nThese six qualities were assigned to four categories of human cognition, the rational (\"Vernunft\") to the beautiful and the noble (red and orange), the intellectual (\"Verstand\") to the good and the useful (yellow and green), the sensual (\"Sinnlichkeit\") to the useful and the common (green and blue) and, closing the circle, imagination (\"Phantasie\") to both the unnecessary and the beautiful (purple and red).\n\nMagenta appeared as a colour term only in the mid-nineteenth century, after Goethe. Hence, references to Goethe's recognition of \"magenta\" are fraught with interpretation. If one observes the colours coming out of a prism—an English person may be more inclined to describe as magenta what in German is called \"Purpur\"—so one may not lose the intention of the author.\n\nHowever, literal translation is more difficult. Goethe's work uses two composite words for mixed (intermediate) hues along with corresponding usual colour terms such as \"orange\" and \"violet\".\n\nIt is not clear how Goethe's \"Rot\", \"Purpur\" (explicitly named as the complementary to green), and \"Schön\" (one of the six colour sectors) are related between themselves and to the red tip of the visible spectrum. The text about interference from the \"physical\" chapter does not consider \"Rot\" and \"Purpur\" synonymous. Also, \"Purpur\" is certainly distinct from \"Blaurot\", because \"Purpur\" is named as a colour which lies somewhere between \"Blaurot\" and \"Gelbrot\" (, paragraph 476), although possibly not adjacent to the latter. This article uses the English translations from the above table.\n\n\"The essential difference between Goethe’s theory of colour and the theory which has prevailed in science (despite all modifications) since Newton’s day, lies in this: While the theory of Newton and his successors was based on excluding the colour-seeing faculty of the eye, Goethe founded his theory on the eye’s experience of colour.\"\n\n\"The renouncing of life and immediacy, which was the premise for the progress of natural science since Newton, formed the real basis for the bitter struggle which Goethe waged against the physical optics of Newton. It would be superficial to dismiss this struggle as unimportant: there is much significance in one of the most outstanding men directing all his efforts to fighting against the development of Newtonian optics.\" (Werner Heisenberg, during a speech celebrating Goethe's birthday)\n\nDue to their different approaches to a common subject, many misunderstandings have arisen between Newton's mathematical understanding of optics, and Goethe's experiential approach.\n\nBecause Newton understands white light to be composed of individual colours, and Goethe sees colour arising from the interaction of light and dark, they come to different conclusions on the question: is the optical spectrum a primary or a compound phenomenon?\n\nFor Newton, the prism is immaterial to the existence of colour, as all the colours already exist in white light, and the prism merely fans them out according to their refrangibility. Goethe sought to show that, as a turbid medium, the prism was an integral factor in the arising of colour.\n\nWhereas Newton narrowed the beam of light in order to isolate the phenomenon, Goethe observed that with a wider aperture, there was no spectrum. He saw only reddish-yellow edges and blue-cyan edges with white between them, and the spectrum arose only where these edges came close enough to overlap. For him, the spectrum could be explained by the simpler phenomena of colour arising from the interaction of light and dark edges.\n\nNewton explains the appearance of white with colored edges by saying that due to the differing overall amount of refraction, the rays mix together to create a full white towards the centre, whereas the edges do not benefit from this full mixture and appear with greater red or blue components. For Newton's account of his experiments, see his \"Opticks\" (1704).\n\nGoethe's reification of darkness is rejected by modern physics. Both Newton and Huygens defined darkness as an absence of light. Young and Fresnel showed that Huygens’ wave theory (in his Treatise on Light) could explain that colour is the visible manifestation of light's wavelength. Physicists today attribute both a corpuscular and undulatory character to light—comprising the wave–particle duality.\n\nThe first edition of the \"Farbenlehre\" was printed at the Cotta’schen Verlagsbuchhandlung on May 16, 1810, with 250 copies on grey paper and 500 copies on white paper. It contained three sections: i) a didactic section in which Goethe presents his own observations, ii) a polemic section in which he makes his case against Newton, and iii) a historical section.\n\nFrom its publication, the book was controversial for its stance against Newton. So much so, that when Charles Eastlake translated the text into English in 1840, he omitted the content of Goethe's polemic against Newton.\n\nGoethe was initially induced to occupy himself with the study of colour by the questions of hue in painting. \"During his first journey to Italy (1786–88), he noticed that artists were able to enunciate rules for virtually all the elements of painting and drawing except color and coloring. In the years 1786–88, Goethe began investigating whether one could ascertain rules to govern the artistic use of color.\"\n\nThis aim came to some fulfillment when several pictorial artists, above all Philipp Otto Runge, took an interest in his colour studies. After being translated into English by Charles Eastlake in 1840, the theory became widely adopted by the art world—especially among the Pre-Raphaelites. J. M. W. Turner studied it comprehensively and referenced it in the titles of several paintings. Wassily Kandinsky considered it \"one of the most important works.\"\n\nDuring a party in Weimar in the winter of 1785, Goethe had a late-night conversation with the South American revolutionary Francisco de Miranda. In a letter written to Count Semyon Romanovich Vorontsov (1792), Miranda recounted how Goethe, fascinated with his exploits throughout the Americas and Europe, told him, \"Your destiny is to create in your land a place where primary colours are not distorted.” He proceeded to clarify what he meant:\nIn the nineteenth century Goethe's Theory was taken up by Schopenhauer in \"On Vision and Colors\", who developed it into a kind of arithmetical physiology of the action of the retina, much in keeping with his own representative idealism [\"The world is my representation or idea\"].\n\nIn the twentieth century the theory was transmitted to philosophy via Wittgenstein, who devoted a series of remarks to the subject at the end of his life. These remarks are collected as \"Remarks on Colour\", (Wittgenstein, 1977).\n\nWittgenstein was interested in the fact that some propositions about colour are apparently neither empirical nor exactly \"a priori\", but something in between: phenomenology, according to Goethe. However, Wittgenstein took the line that 'There is no such thing as phenomenology, though there \"are\" phenomenological problems.' He was content to regard Goethe's observations as a kind of logic or geometry. Wittgenstein took his examples from the Runge letter included in the \"Farbenlehre\", e.g. \"White is the lightest colour\", \"There cannot be a transparent white\", \"There cannot be a reddish green\", and so on. The logical status of these propositions in Wittgenstein's investigation, including their relation to physics, has been discussed in Jonathan Westphal's \"Colour: a Philosophical Introduction\" (Westphal, 1991).\n\nDuring Goethe's lifetime (that is, between 1810 and 1832) countless scientists and mathematicians commented on Goethe's Newton criticism in color theory, namely in reviews, books, book chapters, footnotes, open letters. Most of these votes (just under half) spoke against Goethe, especially Thomas Young , Louis Malus, Pierre Prévost and Gustav Theodor Fechner. One third of the statements from the natural sciences were in favour of Goethe, in particular Thomas Johann Seebeck, Johann Salomo Christoph Schweigger and Johann Friedrich Christian Werneburg, and one-fifth expressed ambivalence or a draw.\n\nAs early as 1853, in Hermann von Helmholtz's lecture on Goethe's scientific works—he says of Goethe's work that he depicts the perceived phenomena—\"circumstantially, rigorously true to nature, and vividly puts them in an order that is pleasant to survey, and proves himself here, as everywhere in the realm of the factual, to be the great master of exposition\" (Helmholtz 1853). Helmholtz ultimately rejects Goethe's theory as the work of a poet, but expresses his perplexity at how they can be in such agreement about the facts of the matter, but in violent contradiction about their meaning—'And I for one do not know how anyone, regardless of what his views about colours are, can deny that the theory in itself is fully consequent, that its assumptions, once granted, explain the facts treated completely and indeed simply'. (Helmholtz 1853)\n\nAlthough the accuracy of Goethe's observations does not admit a great deal of criticism, his aesthetic approach did not lend itself to the demands of analytic and mathematical analysis used ubiquitously in modern Science.\n\nMuch controversy stems from two different ways of investigating light and colour. Goethe was not interested in Newton's analytic treatment of colour—but he presented an excellent \"rational description\" of the phenomenon of human colour perception. It is as such a collection of colour observations that we must view this book.\n\nMitchell Feigenbaum came to believe that \"Goethe had been right about colour!\"\n\n\"Newton believed that with the help of his prism experiments, he could prove that sunlight was composed of variously coloured rays of light. Goethe showed that this step from observation to theory is more problematic than Newton wanted to admit. By insisting that the step to theory is not forced upon us by the phenomena, Goethe revealed our own free, creative contribution to theory construction. And Goethe's insight is surprisingly significant, because he correctly claimed that all of the results of Newton's prism experiments fit a theoretical alternative equally well.. a century before Duhem and Quine's famous arguments for Underdetermination.\"\n\n\"Goethe’s critique of Newton was not an attack on reason or science, though it has often been portrayed that way.. The critique maintained that Newton had mistaken mathematical imagining as the pure evidence of the senses.. Goethe tried to define the scientific function of imagination: to interrelate phenomena once they have been meticulously produced, described, and organized... Newton had introduced dogma.. into color science by claiming that color could be reduced to a function of rays.\" (Dennis L. Sepper, 2009)\n\"Although he soon rejected Newton’s differential refrangibility, Goethe always affirmed Newtonian mechanics. It was not an apriori poetic prejudice against mathematical analysis but rather performing the experiments that led him to reject the theory... Goethe soon concluded that in order to explain color one needs to know not just about light but also about eye function and relative differences in light across the visual field.\" (Sepper, 2009)\n\nAs a catalogue of observations, Goethe's experiments probe the complexities of human colour perception. Whereas Newton sought to develop a mathematical model for the behaviour of light, Goethe focused on exploring how colour is perceived in a wide array of conditions. Developments in understanding how the brain interprets colours, such as colour constancy and Edwin H. Land's retinex theory bear striking similarities to Goethe's theory.\n\nA modern treatment of the book is given by Dennis L. Sepper in the book, \"Goethe contra Newton: Polemics and the Project for a New Science of Color\" (Cambridge University Press, 2003).\n\n\n\n"}

The ISP itself is a 550-person maximum security unit. Also on the complex is a John Bennett Correctional Center - a 169-person medium security unit. Two minimum security farms with about 170 people are located within a few miles of the main complex. The complex also has a ten-person multiple care unit, and a 120-bed special needs unit for prisoners with mental illness or other diseases that require special medical care. In total there are about 950 inmates and 510 staff members.\n\nThe prison offers adult basic, general, and special education services. The prison offers vocational training in upholstering, commercial cooking, automobile repair, printing, and machining. The prison also provides labor for two large farms, one crop and one livestock. For those with drug or alcohol problems a six-month substance abuse program is offered. Alcoholics Anonymous also operates at the complex.\n\nThe prison was established in 1839, one year after Iowa became a territory, and seven years before it became a state in 1846. ISP was patterned after the penitentiary in Auburn, New York. In 1982 the prison was remodeled, and unitization was introduced at ISP. The unitization divided the large cell blocks into smaller units that were easier to manage. In 2008 the prison's library was moved to another location on the grounds. The ISP library offers an extensive book collection, as well as computers for inmate use. However, prisoners do not have access to the Internet.\n\nBefore the abolition of capital punishment in Iowa, executions were performed at Fort Madison. An interesting note in the history of the prison was the execution of Victor Feguer. Feguer was a drifter who had murdered Dubuque doctor Edward Bartels. After appeals that even went as far as President John F. Kennedy were denied, Feguer was executed by hanging on March 15, 1963. Feguer was the last inmate in the Federal prison system to be put to death for nearly 40 years until the execution of Timothy McVeigh at the Terre Haute, Indiana Federal Prison in 2001. Feguer also became the last person in Iowa to be executed; soon after his death, Iowa abolished the death penalty. While Feguer's death attracted little attention at the time, the execution of McVeigh attracted renewed interest in the Feguer execution.\n\nThe 1981 riot was on September 2, and lasted from approximately 10:20 AM–9:25 PM.\n\nSeveral inmates started the uprising by taking four hostages, among them Security Director James Mekne and Assistant Security Director Larry Moline, who were later released in exchange for the offenders being allowed to talk to the news media about prisoner grievances. In addition, eight newly hired employees at ISP were also taken hostage and forced to trade clothes with the offenders. Most were beaten. It was originally thought this incident was spontaneous although it was later reported it was the result of a plan conceived and executed by a handful of inmates. Inmates used a tractor to pull the door off Cellhouse 20. By the time the offenders had broken in, law enforcement personnel had cut the bars out of the cell house, removed the employees who had been hiding there and rewelded the bars back shut. A forklift from the Prison Industries facility was taken in an attempt to break into Cellhouse 17 West, which held protective custody inmates. No prisoners escaped.\n\nKenneth Sheffey, 21, was the original uprising spokesman. He was serving life in prison for the first-degree murder of Roddy Lee Hahn, 15. He made numerous demands, including getting to speak with selected members of the media to air some of the inmates' grievances.\n\nThree bloodied inmates (a robber, a burglar, and an arsonist) were found locked in their cells Monday morning after the riot had been contained. It was thought at least one was a person other inmates didn't like very well. After the incident, they were taken to University of Iowa Hospitals in Iowa City. Up to 15 prisoners were actively involved in the uprising, but estimated that 60 of the 90 inmates in the cellblock were outside their cells when the assault teams burst in.\n\nOne inmate, Gary Eugene Tyson, was murdered. Other prisoners believed Tyson was talking to authorities investigating the May 1981 death of Allen Lewis, another inmate. It was because of this act that officials believed the riot had been started. Tyson's body was found in a storage room attached to the prison kitchen. Tyson had been stabbed nine times in the neck, nine times in the left side of the chest, three times in the left side of the back, and once in the left hand. A makeshift knife was still protruding from Tyson's neck. Evidence produced at trial would permit the jury to find the following facts: Tyson was a member of the prison gang known as the \"Almighty Vice Lords.\" During the murder investigation of Lewis, a number of Vice Lords were placed in \"segregation\" (locked status) in Cellblock 20. Among them were Tyson and the undisputed leader of the gang, Allen Langely. Langley received two life sentences in connection with the slaying of Tyson and a life sentence for the May 1981 slaying of Lewis. He was charged with first-degree murder in both slayings.\n\nHal Farrier, Dept. of Corrections director at the time, ordered assault teams into the prison without consulting Gov. Terry Branstad as time was of the essence. The squads converged on the cellblock from all directions. Some inmates gave minor resistance. Some were armed with table legs and broken broom handles. Prison officials said there were 536 inmates in the 550-capacity prison when the uprising began.\n\nThe warden at the time of the riot was David Scurr. The deputy warden was Paul Hedgepeth.\n\nMore than $1 million in property damage was done.\n\nOn November 14, 2005 two inmates were the first to escape from the facility since 1979. The two men, Robert Joseph Legendre and Martin Shane Moon used upholstery webbing to scale one of the prison's limestone walls. This webbing was used by the prison industries program to make furniture. Both Legendre and Moon were serving life sentences. Moon was convicted of murdering his roommate in 1990. Legendre is serving a life sentence for attempted murder, weapons, and drug charges. Legendre is serving time at the prison as part of a program between the states of Iowa and Nevada.\nFollowing the escape the prison was locked down. The pair was believed to have stolen a 1995 gold Pontiac Bonneville with the license plate number 776-NOW. After escaping the pair split up.\n\nOn November 17, Moon was captured near Chester, Illinois. Authorities discovered him sleeping in a stolen vehicle near Menard State Prison. Around 3 A.M. law enforcement approached the car and asked Moon for his I.D. Moon instead started the vehicle and led police on a short chase. He later left the vehicle and tried to flee on foot, but was apprehended at that point. He waived extradition and was returned to the Fort Madison prison. The next day Legendre was captured in Caruthersville, Missouri. He has yet to be returned to Iowa, and remains in custody in Missouri.\n\nThe main reason the two inmates were able to escape was because the wall they scaled was unguarded - the nearest guard tower was unmanned due to low staff levels. Corrections officials have indicated that budget cuts had forced them to lower staffing levels. These escapes have already touched off a political debate in Iowa. Democratic state Senator Gene Fraise of Fort Madison suggested that the staffing levels were the primary reason the escapes were successful. Republicans have countered that advances in technology have allowed for prison resources to be redirected.\n\nFormer Governor Vilsack had an investigation undertaken into this incident. Several employees were disciplined in the wake of the escapes, and warden Ken Burger was replaced by John Ault - who had been warden at the Anamosa, Iowa prison. Vilsack also asked for recommendations on whether or not a new maximum security institution should be built - which he estimates could cost up to $40 million.\n\nGroundbreaking ceremonies were held in Fort Madison on Thursday, April 22, 2010 for a new, 800 inmate prison to replace the Iowa State Penitentiary. Iowa Governor Chet Culver led the ceremony for the projected $130 million project which was scheduled to be completed in 2014. The new Iowa State Penitentiary was completed in 2014, though some problems kept the new facility from opening on schedule, inmates were transferred from the old facility to the new on August 1, 2015. As of August 2016, there continue to be concerns raised by AFSCME, the union representing Iowa's state employees, about staffing levels at Iowa's prisons; often after injuries of either prisoners and/or corrections officers become known to the public.

The prison is still owned by the state of Iowa, who pays about $1,000 a day to keep the lights on and the site secure. The city wants an environmental study to be done before prison ownership is transferred to a non profit.\n\nIn an MSNBC episode of Lockup: Raw, the prisons extensive religious programs were profiled. Iowa State Penitentiary allows inmates to participate in a wide range of religious observations, ranging from Buddhism and Wicca to Satanism. In the episode a group of inmates can be seen lighting candles and using a gong during a Satanic service, after which various aspects of the Satanic Bible are discussed on camera. During the filming, the prison's chaplain speaks of the importance of religious practice to the inmates daily lives.\n\n\n\n"}

Her father was an attorney and public prosecutor who also served as a district attorney, commissioner of police and a judge. Her mother, known as Zazita, was a pianist. Because of the nature of her father's work, the family moved often throughout the state, living at various times in Apiaí, Assis, Itatinga and Sertãozinho. When she was eight years old, Fagundes moved with her mother to Rio de Janeiro, where they remained for five years. Returning to São Paulo, she enrolled in Caetano de Campos School, and graduated in 1937. With proceeds from her father, in 1938, she published \"Porões e Sobrados\" (Grounds and Townhouses), a collection of short stories.\n\nIn 1939, Fagundes graduated with her pre-law and physical education degrees from the University of São Paulo (USP). In 1941, she enrolled in the Law School at USP () as one of only six women students in a class of over one hundred men. Simultaneously, she began working for the government, with the Secretary of Agriculture, as well as writing her second book of short stories, \"Praia Viva\" (Living Beach), which she published in 1944. The following year, she graduated with her law degree and in 1947, married her international law professor, Goffredo Telles Jr. The couple would have their only child, Goffredo da Silva Telles Neto in 1952.\n\nTelles continued to work in civil service and became a collaborator with \"A Manhã\" (The Morning) writing a weekly column for the journal located in Rio. In 1949 she received the Afonso Arinos award from the Brazilian Academy of Letters for her short stories book \"O Cacto Vermelho\" (Red Cactus). Among her most successful books is \"Ciranda de Pedra\" (The Marble Dance) (1954 reprinted in 1986), which deals with women's sexuality. Telles felt that it was the first work she had produced that marked her maturity as a writer, often criticizing her earlier works. In 1958, she published \"Histórias do Desencontro\" (Uncontrollable Stories) which won the prize of the . In 1960, Telles divorced, and the following year began working as a solicitor for the Institute of Providence () of the State of São Paulo. She would work in this office and continue her publishing efforts simultaneously until 1991. In 1962, she married, the film critic and writer , though as divorce was not technically recognized in Brazil at that time, their partnership was considered socially unacceptable.\n\nTelles continued writing in the following decades, such works as: \"Verão no Aquário\" (Summer at the Aquarium, 1963), which won the Jabuti Prize in 1965; \"Capitu\" (1967, published 1993) a cinematic script co-written with her husband Gomes based upon Machado de Assis' work \"Dom Casmurro\", which won the Candango Award for best screenplay in 1969; \"Antes do Baile Verde\" (Before the Green Ball, 1970), which won \"the Best Foreign Women Writers Grand Prix\" in Cannes (France) in 1969; \"As Meninas\" (The Girls, 1973), which received multiple awards, including the Jabuti Prize, the Coelho Neto Prize of the Brazilian Academy of Letters and the Best Fiction Award from the São Paulo Association of Art Critics; \"Seminário dos Ratos\" (Seminary of the Rats, 1977), which would win the award for best short story from the Pen Club of Brazil that same year; \"A Disciplina do Amor\" (The Discipline of Love, 1980), which won her another Jabuti Prize, as well as the São Paulo Association of Art Critics Award; and \"As Horas Nuas\", (Naked Hours, 1989), which won the \"Book of the Year\" and was honored with the Prêmio Pedro Nava.\n\nTelles' most acclaimed novel, \"As Meninas\", tells the story of three young women in the early 1970s, a difficult time in the political history of Brazil due to the repression by the military dictatorship. She was among intellectuals who went to Brasilia in 1977, to deliver the Manifesto of the Thousand (). The protest was the largest demonstration of intellectuals since the press censorship instituted by president/dictator Emílio Garrastazu Médici began in 1968. She led the delegation, composed of historian and the writers Nélida Piñon and Jefferson Ribeiro de Andrade to present the signed petition to Armando Falcão, the Justice Minister in the cabinet of President Ernesto Geisel. Later that same year, her husband, Gomes would die. On 24 October 1985, Telles was elected to hold Chair 16, of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, the third woman ever to be elected to a chair. After her retirement from the Institute of Providence in 1991, she continued publishing works such as \"A Noite Escura e Mais Eu\" (The Dark Night and More Me, 1995), which won the Arthur Azevedo Prize from the National Library of Brazil; \"Oito contos de amor\" (Eight Tales of Love, 1996); \"Invenção e Memória\" (Invention and Memory, 2001), which earned her the Jabuti Prize, a parallel honor as Book of the Year, and the Grand Prize of the Critic of the Best of 2000 from the São Paulo Association of Art Critics; \"Durante Aquele Estranho Chá\" (During the Strange Tea, 2002); \"Conspiração de Nuvens\" (Cloud Compromise, 2007), which won the São Paulo Association of Art Critics Prize; and \"Passaporte para a China\" (Passport to China, 2011).\n\nIn 1985, Telles was honored as a commander in the Order of Rio Branco by the government of Brazil.

It fell in Australia in 1969 near Murchison, Victoria. It belongs to a group of meteorites rich in organic compounds. \n\nIn January 2020, astronomers reported that the oldest material found on Earth to date is the silicon carbide particles from the Murchison meteorite, which have been determined to be 7 billion years old, about 2.5 billion years older than the 4.54-billion-year age of the Earth and the Solar System. The published study noted that \"dust lifetime estimates mainly rely on sophisticated theoretical models. These models, however, focus on the more common small dust grains and are based on assumptions with large uncertainties.\"\n\nOn 28 September 1969 at approximately 10:58 a.m. local time, near Murchison, Victoria, in Australia, a bright fireball was observed to separate into three fragments before disappearing, leaving a cloud of smoke. About 30 seconds later, a tremor was heard. Many fragments were found scattered over an area larger than , with individual mass up to ; one, weighing , broke through a roof and fell in hay. The total collected mass of the meteorite exceeds .\n\nThe meteorite belongs to the CM group of carbonaceous chondrites. Like most CM chondrites, Murchison is petrologic type 2, which means that it experienced extensive alteration by water-rich fluids on its parent body before falling to Earth. CM chondrites, together with the CI group, are rich in carbon and are among the most chemically primitive meteorites. Like other CM chondrites, Murchison contains abundant calcium-aluminium-rich inclusions. More than 15 amino acids, some of the basic components of life, have been identified during multiple studies of this meteorite.\n\nIn January 2020, astronomers reported that Murchison meteorite silicon carbide particles had been determined to be 7 billion years old, 2.5 billion years older than the 4.54 billion years age of the Earth and the solar system, and the oldest material found on Earth to date.\n\nMurchison contains common amino acids such as glycine, alanine, and glutamic acid as well as unusual ones such as isovaline and pseudoleucine. A complex mixture of alkanes was isolated as well, similar to that found in the Miller–Urey experiment. Serine and threonine, usually considered to be earthly contaminants, were conspicuously absent in the samples. A specific family of amino acids called diamino acids was identified in the Murchison meteorite as well.\n\nThe initial report stated that the amino acids were racemic and therefore formed in an abiotic manner, because amino acids of terrestrial proteins are all of the L-configuration. Later the amino acid alanine, which is also a protein amino acid, was found to have an excess of the L-configuration, which led several scientists to suspect terrestrial contamination according to the argument that it would be \"unusual for an abiotic stereoselective decomposition or synthesis of amino acids to occur with protein amino acids but not with non-protein amino acids\". In 1997, L-excesses also were found in a non-protein amino acid, isovaline, suggesting an extraterrestrial source for molecular asymmetry in the solar system. At the same time, L-excesses of alanine were found in Murchison, but with enrichment in the isotope , however, the isotopic pairing was contested later, on analytical grounds. By 2001, the list of organic materials identified in the meteorite was extended to polyols.\n\nThe meteorite contained a mixture of left-handed and right-handed amino acids; most amino acids used by living organisms are left-handed in chirality, and most sugars used are right-handed. A team of chemists in Sweden demonstrated in 2005 that this homochirality could have been triggered or catalyzed, by the action of a left-handed amino acid such as proline.\n\nSeveral lines of evidence indicate that the interior portions of well-preserved fragments from Murchison are pristine. A 2010 study using high resolution analytical tools including spectroscopy, identified 14,000 molecular compounds, including 70 amino acids, in a sample of the meteorite. The limited scope of the analysis by mass spectrometry provides for a potential 50,000 or more unique molecular compositions, with the team estimating the possibility of millions of distinct organic compounds in the meteorite.\n\nMeasured purine and pyrimidine compounds were found in the Murchison meteorite. Carbon isotope ratios for uracil and xanthine of δC = +44.5‰ and +37.7‰, respectively, indicate a non-terrestrial origin for these compounds. This specimen demonstrates that many organic compounds could have been delivered by early solar system bodies and may have played a key role in life's origin.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1886719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1886719", "title": "M734 fuze", "text": "M734 fuze\n\nThe M734 multi-option fuze is a rangefinder and collision detection system used on 60mm, 81mm, and 120mm mortar shells as a trigger to detonate the shells at the most damaging heights of burst when combating four types of battlefield threats:\n\nThis integration of four functions into a single fuze reduces the logistics and cost to support mortar crews on the battlefield.\n\nA typical mortar firing procedure is for a squad leader to select a target and call for one of the four fuze settings. A gunner sights the mortar onto the target and an ammunition bearer sets the fuze. An assistant gunner drops the shell into the tube upon a command to fire from the squad leader.\n\nTools are not required to install or set the fuze. It is adjusted by hand, even with Arctic mittens, simply by rotating the top of the fuze clockwise until a three-letter engraving is above an index line. Additionally, the setting can be changed any number of times without causing damage to the fuze. The four engravings around the circumference of metal housing of the fuze have the following meanings for detonation height:\n\n\nIn all four settings, the high explosive in the mortar shell is detonated by a cascading explosive train of four increasing energies within the fuze. These are the Microdet electric detonator, the explosive lead, the explosive booster, and the delay primer assembly functioning as follows:\n\nFuzes assembled by the manufacturer are preset to PRX and stockpiled on mortar shells for immediate use. The fuze is safe to handle, however, because the two detonators are mounted in a safety and arming (S&A) assembly that holds them 180 degrees out of alignment with the explosive lead and booster. The events required to rotate the explosive train into alignment and generate power for the fuze electronics cannot be accomplished by accident or deliberately by a vandal because three actions difficult to simulate must be applied in rapid succession:\n\n\nAxial acceleration and wind stream forces combine to arm the fuze 100 meters or more from the launcher. This mechanical arming is accomplished by a torsion spring rotating the detonators 180 degrees into an explosive train alignment as soon as the spring is unlocked by the acceleration forces depressing a zig-zag setback device and the wind stream forces unscrewing a jackscrew locking device.\n\nThis delay in mechanical arming after two independent features of gunfire is a basic safety requirement called \"dual-safing\". An unprecedented third safety factor incorporated as a product improvement in the M734A1 fuze was to delay the electrical arming of the PROX, NSB, and IMP settings beyond 100 meters out to the highest point of shell flight.\n\nThe wind stream in flight provides both the mechanical power needed to arm the S&A and the electrical power needed for the fuze electronics. There is a system of components used in the M734 to capture and regulate air flow within the fuze and convert a portion of the air power to mechanical and electrical power before exiting the fuze.\n\nSince arming is required to occur after a flight of 100 meters for three mortars that have a wide range in launch velocities, the rpm that releases the jackscrew at the slowest launch velocity must increase in direct proportion to any increase in launch velocity. The turbine, however, will tend to spin faster than desired, so, to prevent early arming, three governors are used to reduce the spin:\n\nOnce the air flows from the tips, the air outlet directs the exhaust into the atmosphere at an angle oblique to the external wind stream. The resulting turbulence degrades the accuracy of flight toward the target, so the exhaust is directed onto a vertical metal fin that guides the flow into the external wind stream.\n\nThe performance of the turbine alternator is unaffected if the mortar shell encounters a tropical rainstorm while en route to the target.\n\nThe M734 fuze was developed at the Harry Diamond Laboratories (HDL) for the 60mm lightweight company mortar system, which now is managed by the Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) Fuze Division. It was determined to be suitable for army use in July 1977 and accorded type classification standard. To demonstrate readiness for transition into full rate production by the Armament Munitions and Chemical Command (AMCCOM), ARDEC/HDL managed the first production for war reserves as well as the construction of automated initial production facilities (IPF) for mobilization readiness. HDL awarded three competitive contracts in 1978/79: Eastman Kodak (Rochester, NY) for the fuze assembly and IPF, Motorola (Scottsdale, AZ) for the amplifier assembly and IPF, and Alinabal (Milford, CT.) for the alternator assembly and IPF. After successful first article inspection and production lot acceptance tests, transition was completed in March 1983. AMCCOM performed all procurements for stockpile with technical support by ARDEC. The Army Mortar Plan issued in 1985 expanded use of the M734 fuze to 60mm, 81mm, and 120mm mortars. Improvements in the fuze reliability and performance by ARDEC engineers led to production of the M734A1 fuze manufactured by L-3 FOS (Formerly KDI).\n\n"}

His brothers were Anthemiolus, Marcian and Romulus; he also had a sister, Alypia.\n\nHe lived at Constantinople, at Eastern Emperor Leo I's court, while his father later ruled the Western Roman Empire (467-472), unsuccessfully trying to restore Roman power in the Western provinces beyond Italy and Gaul. During this time, his brother Anthemiolus died while leading an attack against the Visigoths (in 471) and his sister Alypia married Ricimer, the powerful \"magister militum\" of barbarian origin.\n\nIn 474, Leo died. He had left no sons and two daughters, the elder Ariadne, born before Leo was raised to the throne and married to the Isaurian general Zeno, and the younger Leontia, born when Leo was already emperor and married to Procopius' brother, Marcian.\n\nThe people of Constantinople despised the Isaurians, whom they considered barbarians; furthermore, Leontia's status as \"porphyrogenita\" gave her some sort of precedence to the throne, according to the faction that opposed Zeno. For this reason Marcian tried to overthrow Zeno. With the help of Procopius and Romulus, he gathered in Constantinople troops composed of both citizens and foreigners in the house of a Caesarius, south of the Forum of Theodosius, and from there they marched at the same time on the imperial palace and on the house of Illus, an Isaurian general who supported Zeno. The emperor almost fell into the hands of the rebels, who, during the day, overwhelmed the imperial troops, who were also attacked by citizens from the roofs of their houses. During the night, however, Illus succeeded in moving an Isaurian unit quartered in nearby Chalcedonia into Constantinople and in corrupting Marcian's soldiers, who allowed Zeno to flee. On the following morning Marcian, understanding that his situation was desperate and that reinforcements under the Gothic general Theodoric Strabo would not arrive in time, took refuge in the church of the Holy Apostles, but was then arrested with his brothers. \n\nThey were sent to Caesarea in Cappadocia. With the help of some monks, they tried to escape, but Marcian failed, while Procopius fled to Theodoric Strabo in Thrace,--where the latter refused to hand him to Zeno--and then to Rome.\n\nLater Procopius returned to Constantinople, during the reign of Anastasius I (491-518). Empress Ariadne asked Anastasius, whom she had married after Zeno's death, to appoint Procopius praetorian prefect; Anastasius refused, saying that the office required more learning than Procopius had. Nonetheless, he was appointed consul for 515.\n\nProcopius might be the Anthemius who was married to Herais and father of a Zeno betrothed to a nephew of Emperor Zeno; this Anthemius was probably a \"patricius\".\n\n"}

Joseph Sr. died in 1904, and the company was taken over by his sons, the eldest of which, Joseph Jr., was just 17 years of age. By 1930 the company had grown to the point that it required a new factory which was constructed in Monthey.\n\nGiovanola built several submarines: the \"Auguste Piccard\", the \"Ben Franklin\" and the \"F.-A.

Giovanola also fabricated entire rides such as the FreeFall which was also marketed by Intamin. \n\nIn the mid-1980s two Giovanola engineers, Claude Mabillard and Walter Bolliger, developed a new type of roller coaster track system utilizing a box beam spine. The new-style track first made its appearance on a production-model coaster sold by Intamin as a Space Diver. However, only one was sold to Six Flags Great America. It opened in 1985 as Z-Force. A year later Shockwave at Six Flags Magic Mountain, a stand-up coaster, opened utilizing the same box-beam track. In 1987 Bolliger and Mabillard left the company and founded their own business, Bolliger & Mabillard.\n\nIn 1998 Giovanola Amusement Rides Worldwide (GARW) was founded to sell amusement rides built by Giovanola Frères SA. Both companies were based in Monthey, Switzerland. The company remained in business for three years and sold three roller coasters: Goliath at Six Flags Magic Mountain, Titan at Six Flags Over Texas and Anaconda at South Africa's Gold Reef City.\n\nGARW filed for bankruptcy protection in 2001 after the completion of Titan at Six Flags Over Texas which ended the roller-coaster-building business. In 2000 a hydraulic penstock at the Bieudron Hydroelectric Power Station, which was manufactured by Giovanola Frères, failed, rendering the power station inoperative. That incident caused more financial problems for the already weakened company. In 2003-2004 the company filed for bankruptcy and ceased operation. The factory was purchased by the municipality of Monthey and is currently managed by Gessimo, which sub-leases the space to multiple tenants.\n\nGiovanola is credited with building three roller coasters independently.

Alastair Stewart continues to appear on the programme as a relief newscaster, alongside his duties on the \"ITV Lunchtime News\". Coinciding with the main presenter line-up, the programme is once again being referred to as the \"ITV Evening News\".\n\nHe presented ITV News coverage of the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. He also appeared on Celebrity Mastermind for the second time in December 2019, answering questions on Lewis Hamilton.\n\nOn 29 January 2020, Stewart voluntarily stepped down as an ITV News presenter after admitting to multiple \"errors of judgement\" in his use of social media which breached ITN editorial guidelines. Stewart deleted his Twitter account (@alstewitn) before the announcement of his departure was made.\n\nIn one widely reported tweet, he had quoted from \"Measure for Measure\" using the line \"Most ignorant of what he's most assur'd - His glassy elegance - like an angry ape\" while addressing a Black man with whom he had disagreed on Twitter. Martin Shapland, the person referred to in the tweet, said \"I understand that Mr Stewart has acknowledged the words he used were misjudged and has expressed regret at what happened. I thank him for that... It is regrettable that he has decided to stand down and I take no pleasure in that.\"\n\nIn 2003, Stewart was banned from driving for 23 months and fined £3,000; he had been arrested, charged and convicted of drink driving after crashing his car into a hedge and telegraph pole whilst three times over the drink drive limit.\n\nStewart has been married to Sally Ann Jung since 1978 and has four children.

He does not use his title and prefers to be known solely as John Bute, although he has also been called Johnny Dumfries. The family home is Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute. He attended Ampleforth College, as had his father and most male members of the Crichton-Stuart family, but did not finish the normal five years of study.\n\nBorn in Rothesay, Argyll and Bute, into one of Scotland's oldest aristocratic families and the descendant of a British Prime Minister, Johnny Dumfries/John Bute was heir to a large fortune. He turned his back on an expensive education at Ampleforth College and set about pursuing a career in motor racing.\n\nIn 1984 Dumfries was the sensation of the F3 season, scoring 14 race victories on his way to winning, and completely dominating, the British Formula 3 Championship for Team BP (Dave Price Racing). He also finished runner-up to Ivan Capelli in the European Formula Three Championship that year. In 1985, he graduated to the newly created FIA International Formula 3000 Championship, initially competing for Onyx Race Engineering before switching to Lola Motorsport. It was a disappointing season, with a sixth-place finish in Vallelunga being the highlight of the year.\n\nIn he made his breakthrough into F1, and raced a single season for the JPS Team Lotus. He was a late addition to the team, apparently as a result of Ayrton Senna not wanting Derek Warwick as a teammate. He competed in 15 Grands Prix for Lotus (not qualifying at Monaco), which used the turbocharged Renault engines and scored 3 championship points.\n\nHe was replaced for by the Japanese driver Satoru Nakajima as part of Lotus's deal to use Honda engines from that season onwards. During the most part of the season, he was usually one of the midfield drivers, on par with the Tyrrell drivers Martin Brundle and Philippe Streiff.\n\nIn 1988, Dumfries scored the biggest racing victory of his career when he won the Le Mans 24 Hours driving a Jaguar XJR-9 for Tom Walkinshaw's Silk Cut Jaguar Team alongside Dutchman Jan Lammers and Englishman Andy Wallace. \n\nDumfries also participated in the 1-hour endurance race in the 1988 British Touring Car Championship at Donington Park with fellow ex-F1 Briton Guy Edwards for Andy Rouse's Kaliber Racing team in Ford Sierra RS500, finishing third overall and in Class A.\n\nHe ranked 616th in the \"Sunday Times Rich List 2008\", with an estimated wealth of £125m.

The Magistrates' Court is a court of summary jurisdiction.\nA typical courtroom layout consists of a witness box, a public gallery, the bar table (at which the parties sit), a raised bench for seating the sitting magistrate and a clerk and sometimes a dock for housing defendants in custody. Many Victorian magistrates' courts have video link facilities for witnesses to appear via remote video conference rather than in person and is used for when witnesses cannot travel or the prisoner is unable to travel to court in person.\n\nThe Magistrates' Court of Victoria hears many different types of cases, such as:\n\nMagistrates are appointed by the Attorney General after receiving expressions of interest from Australian lawyers and are appointed as members of the Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal (VOCAT), which is a separate and independent statutory entity which determines claims for compensation made by victims of crime and their families.\n\nAlthough the current court was established by the \"Magistrates' Court Act 1989\" (Victoria), Victoria has had magistrates since 1836, when the people of Melbourne elected an arbitrator of the city to resolve minor disputes. Captain William Lonsdale, a police magistrate, was appointed in 1836 and the first case was heard at a location near the present site of Southern Cross station (formerly Spencer Street station).\n\nIn 1838, a third court, the Court of Petty Sessions was created. By 1890, all three types of courts were held at 235 locations throughout Victoria.\n\nOn 20 January 1914, the new City Court was opened at Russell Street in Melbourne and Phillip Blashki JP was the first Chairman of the City Court Bench. The then Prime Minister, Alfred Deakin, presented Blashki with an illuminated address signed by 30 of the court's solicitors when he retired, aged 70.\n\nPolice magistrates were able to sit in on Petty Court sessions, but generally two or three Justice of the Peace were required for cases to be heard.

The legs are also long and thin, up to across, and the animal's carapace may be up to long. Colouration is variable in this species; the body may be golden, yellow or cream, marked with brown, black or iridescent-blue lines; the legs are reddish or yellow, and the claws are blue or violet. This species presents as diagnostic features: triangular body with long pointed snout (rostrum), carapace decorated with fine dark lines and claws often have violet tips. \"S. seticornis\" is most commonly associated with anemones, in groups ranging from one to six individuals in south-eastern Brazil.\n\n\"Stenorhynchus seticornis\" is commonly found in the shallow sub-tidal on rock bottoms, corals, calcareous algae, and also on soft sediments, such as shelly gravel and sand. Its geographical distribution is restricted to the Occidental Atlantic, from North Carolina to Argentina. \"Stenorhynchus seticornis\" is found in the western Atlantic Ocean, from North Carolina and Bermuda to Brazil, including throughout the Caribbean Sea. It lives on coral reefs at depths of .\n\n\"S. seticornis\" is nocturnal and territorial. It eats small feather duster worms and other coral reef invertebrates. This crab is commonly kept in reef aquariums to control bristle worm populations.\n\n\"S. seticornis\" is one of a number of different invertebrates that are found living in association with the sea anemone, \"Lebrunia danae\". It is often found among the anemone's pseudotentacles along with Pederson's cleaning shrimp (\"Ancylomenes pedersoni\") and the spotted cleaner shrimp (\"Periclimenes yucatanicus\").\n\n\"S. seticornis\" have displayed notable negative phototaxis, meaning the organism prefers to avoid sunlight. This species changes location during the day and nighttime.\n\nThere is a considerable number of reports on cleaning symbiosis among reef fish, moray eels, and squirrelfish. This is a somewhat unexpected relationship as moray eels and squirrelfish can be considered dangerous clients as crabs are important elements of their diets. This behavior has only been observed in the natural environment in Brazilian waters but it is believed that this behavior also exists throughout its distribution.\n\nDuring mating, the male places a spermatophore on the female, which she uses to fertilise her eggs. These fertilised eggs are then carried on the female's pleopods until they are ready to hatch into zoea larvae. These swim towards the ocean surface and feed on plankton. They grow through a series of moults, and eventually metamorphose into the adult form. When mature, the spermatozoa of \"S. seticornis\" show five lateral arms, similar to the sperm morphology of \"Inachus phalangium.\"\n\nClimate majorly regulates the breeding period of the arrow crab. Seasonal variation of water temperature and sunlight duration are considered as the most important variables determining the breeding period of arrow crabs.\n\nThere is a positive relationship between fecundity and the size of the parental female. In fact, the size of the female is the key variable in determining the number of eggs per batch. The female also determines the reproductive output of arrow crabs.\n\nLarvae that has grown in shallow water differ from larvae that grows in deeper water. They key difference in larvae is in the setation of he endopodite of the maxilla.\n\n\"Stenorhynchus seticornis\" was first described by Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Herbst in 1788, under the name \"Cancer seticornis\". It was also described as \"\"Cancer sagittarius\"\" by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1793, a name which is now a junior synonym of \"S. seticornis\". Pierre André Latreille erected the genus \"Stenorhynchus\" (originally mis-spelt \"Stenorynchus\") in 1818, and \"S. seticornis\" was confirmed as the type species by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature in 1966.\n"}

It starts at US Highway 2 (US 2) near Blaney Park north of Lake Michigan. The highway borders the eastern edge of the Seney National Wildlife Refuge and passes through the community of Germfask. At Seney, it overlaps M-28 to cross the Fox River before returning northward. The northern half has been designated as a Scenic Spur of the Lake Superior Circle Tour. M-77 runs along the eastern end of the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore and terminates in Grand Marais north of H-58 near Lake Superior. Originally designated by 1919, the highway has not been changed much in its history. By the late 1950s, the highway was paved, completing the modern M-77 highway.\n\nFrom US 2 near Blaney Park going north, M-77 runs past the former Blaney Park Resort and out of town by a small private airport next to Lake Ann Louise. The highway continues through rural woodlands past Chip Lake. The road crosses the Manistique River as it runs through Germfask. From just south of Germfask to just south of Seney, the road forms the eastern boundary of the Seney National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nThe refuge is a managed wetland in Schoolcraft County in Michigan. Established in 1935, it has an area of bordered by M-28 and M-77 that is the remains of the Great Manistique Swamp, a perched sand wetland located in the central UP. The refuge contains the Strangmoor Bog National Natural Landmark within its boundaries. During the 1930s, work crews employed by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) rebuilt, restored, and expanded the wetland drains, this time for active wetlands management purposes. These CCC ponds and drains are still used by the wetlands managers that staff the current National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nAt Seney, M-77 crosses a line of the Canadian National Railway and turns east along M-28. Both run concurrently for less than half a mile (0.8 km) over a crossing of the Fox River before M-77 turns back northward. About north of Seney, the road turns sharply to the west, near Snyder Lake. The trunkline continues along several other lakes before turning northeasterly and then northward. The road marks the easternmost extent of the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore around south of Grand Marais. Within Grand Marais, the highway follows Lake Avenue through downtown. M-77 intersects H-58 in town and the two designations run concurrently for two blocks. The trunkline continues one block farther north and ends at an intersection with Braziel Street by the Grand Marais harbor; the roadway continues northward as Lake Avenue at that point.\nGrand Marais is situated on the shores of Lake Superior some north of the mainline of the Lake Superior Circle Tour. Since the Tour runs only along state trunklines in Michigan, a Scenic Spur of the tour was created to route traffic north from Seney to Grand Marais. The scenic spur also terminates in Grand Marais with M-77 north of the junction with H-58.\n\nM-77 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2009 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-77 were the 1,924 vehicles daily between Floodwood and Ten Curves roads in Schoolcraft county; the lowest counts were the 799 vehicles per day north of M-28 in Seney. No section of M-77 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.\n\nThe route was first designated by July 1, 1919, with a route very close to its present course. A pair of sharp turns were straightened north of Seney at Lavender Corner around 1950. The last segments of gravel road were paved in 1958–59.\n\n\n"}

He was educated at Harrow School and Winchester College. He went to the University of Oxford, where he had private tuition from James Bladen. The degree of D.C.L., awarded to him by the university in 1793, was honorary.\n\nAround 1757 Stuart began to be tutored by the philosopher Adam Ferguson.\n\nLord Mount Stuart was returned as Tory Member of Parliament for Bossiney at a by-election in 1766. He was returned in the general elections of 1768 and 1774. On 2 November 1775 he announced in the House of Commons his intention to introduce a bill to establish a militia in Scotland, and during the next few months James Boswell assisted in seeking support for the bill in Scotland. In March 1776 the bill was debated, but ultimately failed to pass. He left the House of Commons in 1776 when he was elevated to the Peerage of Great Britain in his own right as Baron Cardiff, of Cardiff Castle in the County of Glamorgan. Though this title was also used, he continued to be known by his courtesy title of Lord Mount Stuart.

During the 20th century, Australian government policies caused children to be separated from their families, with the intention of assimilating them into White Australian culture. This resulted in what became known as the \"Stolen Generations\", with the effects of these traumatic removals being felt by succeeding generations even today. \n\nOn 26 May 1997, the \"Bringing Them Home\" report, the result of a government inquiry into the practice, was tabled in Parliament. The report made many recommendations, including that state and federal governments should issue formal apologies and that funding should be provided to help deal with the consequences of the policies. This date now carries great significance for the Stolen Generations and other Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders, and is also commemorated by many non-Indigenous Australians.\n\nThe incumbent Prime Minister John Howard refused to apologise, but Kevin Rudd issued a formal apology on behalf of the government and people when he was prime minister, on 13 February 2008.\n\nAn older Indigenous protest day is the Day of Mourning, which originated in 1938, focusing on civil rights for Aboriginal people.\n\nOn 26 May 1997, \"Bringing them Home: Report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families\" was tabled in Parliament. Among its many recommendations was one that the Prime Minister apologise to the Stolen Generations. Prime Minister John Howard refused to do so, stating that he \"did not subscribe to the black armband view of history\". The government policy of removing children from their families and placing them in care elsewhere was later described by American sociologist John Torpey as \"Aboriginal children separated, often forcibly, from their families in the interest of turning them into white Australians\".\n\nOn 26 May 1998, the first National Sorry Day was held.\n\nOn 26 August 1999, Prime Minister John Howard moved a Motion of Reconciliation, which included an expression of \"deep and sincere regret that Indigenous Australians suffered injustices under the practices of past generations, and for the hurt and trauma that many Indigenous people continue to feel as a consequence of those practices\". The opposition leader, Kim Beazley, moved to replace John Howard's motion of regret with an unreserved apology which was not successful.\n\nThe annual commemorations are intended to raise awareness among politicians, policy makers, and the wider public about the forcible removal policies and their impact on the children who were taken, their families and their communities.\n\nOn 28 May 2000, more than 250,000 people, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, participated in a walk across Sydney Harbour Bridge, organised by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation to protest the lack of a government apology to Indigenous people, show solidarity and to raise public awareness of the issue. \n\nIn 2005, the National Sorry Day Committee renamed the day as the National Day of Healing, with the motion tabled in Parliament by Senator Aden Ridgeway. In his words, \"the day will focus on the healing needed throughout Australian society if we are to achieve reconciliation\".\n\nOn 13 February 2008, then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd moved a motion of Apology to Indigenous Australians. His apology was a formal apology on behalf of the successive parliaments and governments whose policies and laws \"inflicted profound grief, suffering and loss on these our fellow Australians\". The apology was the new parliament's first order of business; Rudd became the first Australian Prime Minister to publicly apologise to the Stolen Generations on behalf of the Australian federal government. The apology was passed unanimously as a motion by both houses of parliament, as thousands of people gathered to hear the apology both in the Great Hall and outside Parliament House in Canberra and in large gatherings across the country, in schools, offices and public squares. Crying, cheering and clapping followed.\n\nClose the Gap is a social justice campaign focused on Indigenous health, in which \"Australia's peak Indigenous and non-Indigenous health bodies, NGOs and human rights organisations are working together to achieve equality in health\", whose Steering Committee first met in March 2006. Their campaign was launched in April 2007 by patrons Catherine Freeman OAM and Ian Thorpe OAM, launched the Campaign.\n\nThe Australian government adopted its goals in 2008, in a strategy known as Closing the Gap. Rudd pledged the government to bridging the gap between Indigenous and Non-Indigenous Australian health, education and living conditions, and in a way that respects their rights to self-determination. He also proposed to establish a commission to \"close the gap\" between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in \"life expectancy, educational achievement and economic opportunity\". During meetings held in December 2007 and March 2008 the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) adopted six targets (later increased to seven) to improve the wellbeing of Indigenous Australians over the next five to twenty years.\n\nIn 2009, Rudd committed to making an annual progress report to Parliament on progress with the Closing the Gap strategy. Each year, the Close the Gap Steering Committee publishes a report detailing the Government's progress in achieving its targets.\n\n, there have been 11 \"Closing the Gap\" Reports presented to Parliament, providing data in areas that previously had none and updates on progress. Close the Gap has produced 10 reports, including a 10-year review in 2018.\n\n\n"}

The settlement was sacked by the French in 1792, and in the following year a fort was built for its protection.

The Ka Lae area is registered as a National Historic Landmark District under the name South Point Complex. The area is also known for its strong ocean currents and winds and is the home of a wind farm.\n\nThe name for the southern tip of the island of Hawaii comes from \"Ka Lae\" in the Hawaiian language which means \"the point\".\nIt is often spelled as one word, Kalae, or called South Point or South Cape.\nA confluence of ocean currents just offshore makes this spot one of Hawaii's most popular fishing spots. Both red snapper and ulua are plentiful here. Locals fish from the cliffs, some dangling perilously over the edge of steep lava ledges. Swimming here, however, is not recommended, due to the current. In fact, it is called the \"Halaea Current\", named after a chief who was carried off to his death.\n\nThe confluence of currents also means the area is prone to accumulation of marine debris. Most of this coastline is very remote and difficult to access, and is probably the most debris-littered coast in the state, primarily due to its difficult access for debris removal. This debris poses an entanglement threat to wildlife and may refloat during storms. The shoreline is used by Hawaiian monk seals and hatchling hawksbill turtles, both endangered species. Efforts to clean the coastline are organized by the Hawaii Wildlife Fund in conjunction with the NOAA.\n\nKa Lae is accessible via South Point Road, a 12-mile paved narrow road leading from State Route 11 (Hawaii Belt Road), the turn off being about 7 miles (11 km) west of the village of Nāālehu and east of Ocean View, Hawaii. The strong winds cause some trees to become almost horizontal with their branches all growing in the same direction near the ground. The road forks near its end, with one branch leading south to Ka Lae and the other east to Papakolea Beach, known for its green sand.\n\nKa Lae is the southernmost point in the 50 United States.\n\nKa Lae is the site of one of the earliest Hawaiian settlements, and it has one of the longest archaeological records on the islands. It is generally thought that this is where the Polynesians first landed because the Big Island is the closest of the Hawaiian Islands to Tahiti, and Ka Lae would be the point of first landfall. Ruins of an ancient Hawaiian temple (\"heiau\") and a fishing shrine can be found here. In addition, ancient Hawaiians drilled numerous holes in the rock ledges to use for mooring their canoes. Tying long ropes to their boats, they would drift out to sea to fish without fear of being carried away by the strong currents. Anthropologists from the Bishop Museum excavated the area in the 1960s.\n\nOn March 5, 1906 a small lighthouse opened at the point. In 1908 about were set aside for the United States Coast Guard to build a house for a keeper. At the request of William Tufts Brigham of the Bishop Museum, care was taken not to destroy the archaeological site. In 1929 a steel tower was built for the light, and in 1972 a new 32 foot (10m) concrete tower with solar power was built.\n\nA NOAA Weather Radio transmitter broadcasts weather reports from KBA99 with callsign WWG27 on 162.55 MHz.\nA weather station also monitors wind speed.\n\nDuring World War II, the US Air Force built a landing strip called Morse Field on the point. The airfield was closed in 1953.\nIn 1961 South Point was on the list of final sites to be considered by NASA to launch manned rockets to space, but was considered too remote although it was later used to launch sounding rockets for testing of instruments at the Air Force's Maui Space Surveillance Center. The low latitude of the location also made it (and nearby areas that are as remote) attractive as a site for private rocket launches, but these plans were dropped in the face of high costs and local opposition.\n\nA space tracking station was operated from 1964 to 1965, and in the 21st century the Swedish Space Corporation's Universal Space Network again established a remote ground station for space tracking and communications, now consisting of two 13-meter parabolic antennas on the east side of South Point Road. Also at Ka Lae are the large shortwave radio antennas of World Harvest Radio International, which used callsign KWHR until 2009.\n\nIn 1987 the Kamaoa Wind Farm began operation with thirty-seven Mitsubishi 250 kW wind turbines with an operationally typical total peak output of 7.5 MW. By 2006 the turbines at were falling into disrepair, and they were finally shut down on August 15, 2006. At the end of August 2006, components for a new set of wind turbines were transported to South Point. The Pakini Nui project consists of 14 General Electric wind turbines constructed at , about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from the old Kamaoa wind farm. Completed in April 2007, Pakini Nui supplies up to 20.5 MW of power to the island electricity grid of Hawaii Electric Light Company. The wind farm is operated by Tawhiri Power, LLC. It is the southernmost wind farm in the United States. The turbines of the old wind farm have been disassembled.\n\nKa Lae Point is the southernmost point of all fifty states in the United States, but technically it is not the southernmost point in the United States. The southernmost point of all U.S. territory is the United States Territory of Palmyra Island, an incorporated territory of the United States according to the doctrine of \"incorporation\" defined in the Supreme Court's Insular Cases. Palmyra's south point on Holei Island at 5°52'15\" N latitude is officially the southernmost point in the United States of America.\n\n\n"}

The highway starts on the west side of Saginaw at an intersection with M-58 and runs north through residential and commercial areas. There are two colleges or universities near the trunkline as it connects Saginaw with Bay City, providing an alternative to the freeway that carries Interstate 75/US Highway 23 (I-75/US 23). The northern terminus is at a pair of intersections with M-25 on the east side of the Saginaw River in Bay City.\n\nThere have been two other highways to bear the M-84 moniker. The first was one in the Upper Peninsula and the second was in The Thumb area. The current highway was originally part of M-47 until that road was relocated onto what was formerly US 10 in the Tri-Cities area. Since the 1960s reuse of the number, M-84 has been extended in the 1970s to replace part of Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75, now Business Spur I-75, BS I-75) in Bay City. Other projects have reconstructed and widened the roadway through the Bay City area in the early 21st century.\n\nM-84 begins at M-58 in a residential area on the west side of Saginaw heading due north on Bay Street. At this point, it is five lanes, with two lanes in each direction and a center turn lane. The highway enters Saginaw Township as Bay Road and serves as a major artery in the area, passing the Fashion Square Mall and several other shopping centers and major retail stores near Tittabawassee Road. The main entrance to Saginaw Valley State University is located on M-84 at Pierce Road just south of the Saginaw–Bay county line.\n\nNorth of the line, the highway follows West Side Saginaw Road through fields in a less urbanized area. East of University Center and the campus of Delta College, M-84 crosses over I-75/US 23 at exit 160 and proceeds through several curves into Bay City. At the intersection with Euclid Avenue on the city line, M-13 merges in from the north and the two highways run concurrently along Salzburg Avenue. Since this segment of highway is both northbound M-84 and southbound M-13 along eastbound Salzburg Avenue, the two trunklines form a wrong-way concurrency.\n\nM-13/M-84 crosses the west channel of the Saginaw River near the Ted Putz Nature Area to Middle Ground island. The highway continues over the east channel on the Lafayette Avenue Bridge, a drawbridge, to Lafayette Avenue on the eastern bank of the river. At the intersection with Broadway Street, M-13 turns southward, and M-84 continues eastward two more blocks. Turning north on Garfield Street, the highway runs parallel to the river through a residential area. North of the 14th Street intersection, Garfield Street curves northeasterly into Washington Avenue, passing to the east of an industrial complex on the river. At the intersection with McKinley Street, a one-way street, M-84 meets the eastbound direction of M-25 and BS I-75. One block north, M-84 terminates at the intersection with 7th Street, which carries westbound M-25 and BS I-75; both intersections also mark BS I-75's terminus immediately east of the Veterans Memorial Bridge.\n\nThe Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) maintains M-84 like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic level along M-84 was 26,408 vehicles daily in Saginaw; the lowest count was 8,405 vehicles per day on Washington Street in Bay City. Two sections of M-84 have been listed on the National Highway System; the section from the southern terminus north to Tittabawassee Road in the Saginaw area, and from the I-75/US 23 interchange north to M-25 in the Bay City area. The system is a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.\n\nThe first M-84 in Michigan was in the Upper Peninsula starting in 1919; the highway ran from Garnet to McLeods Corner, southeast of Newberry, following the current Borgstrom Road in Mackinac County and County Road 393 in Luce County. The highway was replaced by an extension of M-48 in 1926. The M-84 designation was then immediately reused for a section of the former M-31 in The Thumb; it ran from M-81 near Reese running through Fairgrove and Akron to M-29 at Unionville. This iteration was replaced by M-83 in 1930.\n\nThe I-75/US 10/US 23 freeway was completed between Saginaw and Bay City in late 1960 or early 1961; M-47 was relocated to the former US 10 between Saginaw and Midland, and M-84 was redesignated along the former M-47 between M-81 at Saginaw and the freeway in Bay City. A new BL I-75 was created at the same time along the former M-47 in Bay City. This business loop would be split in half in 1971 resulting in a new business spur; M-84 was extended over the southern section between M-25 and I-75/US 10/US 23.\n\nA reconstruction project in 2004–05 resulted in the roadway being widened to four lanes between Pierce Road in Kochville Township of Saginaw County and Delta Road in Frankenlust Township in Bay County. The 2009 reconstruction resulted in new bridges over I-75 and widening of the road from Delta Road to 2 Mile Road.\n\n"}
{"id": "1886809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1886809", "title": "Ortler", "text": "Ortler\n\nOrtler (; ) is, at above sea level, the highest mountain in the Eastern Alps outside the Bernina Range. It is the main peak of the Ortler Range. It is the highest point of the Southern Limestone Alps, of the Italian province of South Tyrol, of Tyrol overall, and, until 1919, of the Austrian-Hungarian empire. In German the mountain is commonly referred to as \"König Ortler\" (King Ortler), like in the unofficial hymn of South Tyrol, the \"Bozner Bergsteigerlied\".\n\nThe massive mountain is capped by a glacier on the northwest flank and has a long north ridge that ends at the village of \"Gomagoi\" and separates the valleys of Trafoi and Sulden. The South ridge leads to the Hochjoch (3527 m) on the main ridge of the Ortler Alps that forms the border of the Province of Sondrio and South Tyrol. Going west on this main ridge are the Thurwieserspitze (3652) and Trafoier Wall (3565 m), while to the Southeast are the Monte Zebrù (3740 m) and the majestic Königspitze (3859 m). From nearby mountains in the northeast the impressive lineup of Königspitze, Zebru and Ortler is known as “das Dreigestirn” (the three heavenly bodies).\n\nThe Ortler was first climbed by (\"Pseirer-Josele\"), a chamois hunter from St. Leonhard in Passeier, and his companions Johann Leitner and Johann Klausner from Zell am Ziller on 27 September 1804. The ascent had been a request of Archduke Johann of Austria, who felt strongly that after the first ascent of the Großglockner (3,798 m) in 1800, the highest mountain in his brother's empire ought to be climbed. The archduke ordered Johannes Nepomuk Gebhard, a \"mountain official\" and topographer from Salzburg, to climb the mountain with locals. The first five attempts failed and Gebhard was ready to give up, when Pichler responded to the prize money offered for reaching the peak. Pichler and his friends took a difficult, and because of avalanche danger until recently disused, route over the northwest face from Trafoi. (The route was re-opened in 2004.)\n\nUpon their return, the men were not believed on their words alone. Gebhard sent Pichler onto the mountain twice more, first in August 1805 with a flag that could be observed with a telescope from the valley, and again in September 1805 with a huge torch. Only after the torch had been seen burning at night was the accomplishment acknowledged. The route Pichler and his men (two brothers named Hell and an unnamed hunter from Langtaufers) took in 1805 was the currently still popular East ridge (\"Hintergrat\", literally \"back-ridge\") route. In 1834, at the age of 70, Pichler would make his fifth and final ascent, guiding professor to the top.\n\nThe first time the Ortler was climbed via the easiest and currently normal route, the North (\"Tabaretta\") ridge, was more recently, in July 1865, as the approach is rather lengthy. In 1875 a hut was erected 3,029m high on the North ridge, to break up the climb in two steps. It was named the Payer house, after Julius von Payer, who had mapped the Ortler Alps between 1865–1868 and had climbed 50 of its peaks with as his guide.\n\nThe first ascent of the South ridge from the Hochjoch followed in 1875, two couloirs on the East face (the \"Minnigerode\" and \"Schück\" couloir) were opened in 1878-79 and the two steep Northeast ridges (\"Marlet\" and \"Rothböck\" ridge) were conquered in 1889 and 1909, respectively. Members of the Pinggera family were involved in most of these ascents.\n\nThe 1,200 m high ice route on the Ortler north face, longest in the Eastern Alps, was first climbed in June 1931 by Hans Ertl and and the remote Southwest face in 1934. The North face was soloed first in 1963 by Dieter Drescher who had also added some first winter ascents to his name, including a traverse of Königspitze, Monte Zebrù, and Ortler in February 1975. On August 31, 1981, achieved the amazing feat of climbing the north faces of Königspitze, Zebrù and Ortler all in one day.\n\nExtreme skiing started early in the Ortler mountains, with descending the Schück couloir in 1971 and the Minnigerode couloir in 1975. On June 24, 1983, skied down the North face.\n\nThe Ortler Alps were one of the main battlegrounds between Austrian and Italian troops in the First World War, being on the border of Italy and the Austrian Empire. The advantage of owning the highest point was very important. The Austrian troops had quickly occupied the highest peaks, and the Italian troops' main goal, for four years, was to dislodge them from the positions. In the mid-1990s, a mountain guide discovered two guns that had been stationed very near the top of the Ortler but had been hidden by snow ever since. The discovery was kept secret until the 200th anniversary of the first ascent in 2004. The cannons are now on display in a museum in Trafoi.\n\n\n"}

The Royalists were defeated, losing nearly half their officers and men.\n\nKing Charles II accepted the Scottish throne which led to an invasion of Scotland by the New Model Army under the command of Oliver Cromwell. Although Cromwell defeated a Scottish army at the Battle of Dunbar, Cromwell could not prevent Charles II from marching from Scotland deep into England at the head of another Royalist army. The Royalists marched to the west of England where Royalist sympathies were strongest arriving at Worcester on 22 August 1651. He planned to rest his predominantly Scottish army there and await English reinforcements before pressing on to London. One Royalist contingent from the Isle of Man and Lancashire under the command of Earl of Derby, was heading towards Worcester, and it was the duty of Colonel Robert Lilburne to stop them.\n\nOn the day Charles II arrived in Worcester, Lilburne with a company of foot from Manchester, two more from Chester, and fifty or sixty dragoons marched to Wigan, where the enemy was gathering, hoping to surprise them but found they had moved off to Chorley. The next day, on hearing the Royalists were at Preston, Lilburne set off in pursuit. He bivouacked within two miles of the town and sent out patrols to harass the enemy. The next afternoon they retaliated. \"A party of the enemy's horse fell smartly amongst us, where our horse was grazing, and for some space put us pretty hard to it: but at the last it pleased the Lord to strengthen us, that we put them to the flight, and pursued them to Ribble bridge (this was something like our business at Mussleburg) and killed and took about thirty prisoners.\"\n\nLilburne heard Cromwell's regiment of foot was approaching Manchester. Cromwell had detached the regiment with a troop of horse from Rutherford Abbey in Nottinghamshire on the 20th or 21st. Lilburne halted by the Ribble, thinking the foot would join him but though it had marched very rapidly as far as Manchester, it was now obliged to advance with caution as Royalists were reported to have 500 men in Manchester and some of Derby's levies lying between them and Lilburne.\n\nOn the 25th, Lilburne received intelligence that the Earl of Derby was marching towards Wigan and assuming his force was retreating gave chase. However, it was Derby's intention to fall on Cromwell's regiment of infantry before Lilburne's cavalry could join it. When Lilburne reached Wigan he found the enemy in considerable force, both infantry and cavalry, marching out of the town towards Manchester. Having arrived ahead of his own infantry and the terrain surrounding the town consisting of fields and hedges with narrow country lanes unfavourable for cavalry, Lilburne determined to avoid a fight. He instead intended to await infantry reinforcements before flanking the Royalists in Wigan, sending his cavalry around the town to the south while his infantry advanced into the town from the north encircling and preventing Derbys retreat from the town.\n\nDerby, aware of Lilburne's inferiority in strength wheeled about and marched back through the town to defeat the Parliamentary forces piecemeal before they could combine. In spite of the unfavourable nature of the ground Lilburne decided to make a stand. Lilburne deployed his cavalry on Wigan Lane, and lined the hedgerows either side of the road with infantry creating a choke point. As the Royalists approached they were met with a volley of musketry. A fierce fight ensued in the same lanes through which Cromwell had chased the Scots in 1648. Derby divided his cavalry into two equal divisions of 300 men. Derby took command of the vanguard and gave the rear guard command to Sir Thomas Tyldesley. Three times during the day Derby led cavalry charges against the centre of Lilburne's line breaching but failing to break it. By the third charge, the ranks of the Royalists were severely depleted and they were overwhelmed by the superior numbers of Lilburne's arriving infantry, after an hour's fighting the remaining Royalists fled the field.\n\nLord William Witherington, Sir William Throckmorton, Sir Thomas Tyldesley, Colonel Matthew Boynton and 60 others were killed or died of their wounds and 400 prisoners were taken. Cromwell's regiment, which had advanced to join Lilburne picked up many stragglers. Derby escaped badly wounded, and joined Charles at Worcester with only 30 horsemen.\n\nThe Earl of Derby, the Lord of Mann, enlisted ten men from each parish on the Isle of Man, a total of 170 men. David Craine, in \"Manannan's Isle\" states \"those who did not fall in the fighting [were] hunted to their death through the countryside.\"\n\nThe defeat was a blow to the king as this was the only English Royalist force of any size to attempt to ride to his standard in Worcester. Without large numbers of English Royalists to support him, his position was untenable and nine days later his predominantly Scottish army of about 15,000 men was decisively beaten at the Battle of Worcester by a Parliamentary army nearly twice the size under the command of Cromwell. This victory brought to an end Third English Civil War and ushered in nine years of republican rule. Charles escaped to France and lived in exile until his return at the Restoration in 1660.\n\n\n"}

It was this, together with the disappointment of not obtaining the throne, which led Cleonymus to invite Pyrrhus to Sparta in 272. Areus was then absent in Crete, and the safety of Sparta was mainly owing to the valor of Acrotatus who successfully held off the Siege of Sparta. He succeeded his father in 265, but was killed shortly thereafter (possibly in the same year) in battle against Aristodemus the Good, the tyrant of Megalopolis. Pausanias, in speaking of his death, calls him the son of Cleonymus, but he has mistaken him for his grandfather, mentioned above.

Electronic components are mostly industrial products, available in a singular form and are not to be confused with electrical elements, which are conceptual abstractions representing idealized electronic components.\n\nElectronic components have a number of electrical terminals or leads. These leads connect to other electrical components, often over wire, to create an electronic circuit with a particular function (for example an amplifier, radio receiver, or oscillator). Basic electronic components may be packaged discretely, as arrays or networks of like components, or integrated inside of packages such as semiconductor integrated circuits, hybrid integrated circuits, or thick film devices. The following list of electronic components focuses on the discrete version of these components, treating such packages as components in their own right.\n\nComponents can be classified as passive, active, or electromechanic. The strict physics definition treats passive components as ones that cannot supply energy themselves, whereas a battery would be seen as an active component since it truly acts as a source of energy.\n\nHowever, electronic engineers who perform circuit analysis use a more restrictive definition of passivity. When only concerned with the energy of signals, it is convenient to ignore the so-called DC circuit and pretend that the power supplying components such as transistors or integrated circuits is absent (as if each such component had its own battery built in), though it may in reality be supplied by the DC circuit. Then, the analysis only concerns the AC circuit, an abstraction that ignores DC voltages and currents (and the power associated with them) present in the real-life circuit. This fiction, for instance, lets us view an oscillator as \"producing energy\" even though in reality the oscillator consumes even more energy from a DC power supply, which we have chosen to ignore. Under that restriction, we define the terms as used in circuit analysis as:\n\nMost passive components with more than two terminals can be described in terms of two-port parameters that satisfy the principle of reciprocity—though there are rare exceptions. In contrast, active components (with more than two terminals) generally lack that property.\n\nTransistors were considered the invention of the twentieth century that changed electronic circuits forever. A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify and switch electronic signals and electrical power.\n\n\nConduct electricity easily in one direction, among more specific behaviors.\n\n\n\n\nCurrent:\nObsolete:\n\nA vacuum tube is based on current conduction through a vacuum (see Vacuum tube).\n\n\nOptical detectors or emitters\n\n\nObsolete:\n\nSources of electrical power:\n\nComponents incapable of controlling current by means of another electrical signal are called \"passive\" devices.

The colony is protected from Earth by an enormously powerful but infantile mutant called Big Noodle. The central character is a precog, Curtis or Curt, who uncovers the existence of 'anti-psi's' - humans with the ability to cancel out or nullify the powers of the psionic mutants.\n\nHe attempts to get the non-psychic or 'Norm'-led government to officially recognize the anti-psi's, knowing that this could balance out the corrupting power that the psi's would soon possess over the rest of humanity.

It has grown recently as a dormitory settlement for Cambridge.\n\nWaterbeach is on the Car Dyke, a Roman waterway whose course can be traced as far as Lincoln. Recent archaeological investigations have found extensive evidence of Roman settlement at the south end of the village.\n\nWaterbeach appears in the 1086 Domesday Book as Utbech. In the 12th century, the Knights Templar occupied Denny Abbey to the north of the village, one of several Scheduled Ancient Monuments, which houses the Farmland Museum. Also scheduled are the site of Waterbeach Abbey, to the south of the present church, and a stretch of the Car Dyke.\n\nThe lawyer/politician John Yaxley acquired an estate at Waterbeach by 1610 and lived there. He and Edward Aungier of Cambridge purchased the manors of Waterbeach and Causeway from the Crown for £900 in 1614.\n\nA Royal Air Force station, RAF Waterbeach, was built on the northern edge of the village in 1940, for the RAF Bomber Command. After the Second World War, the station was operated by RAF Transport Command and then by RAF Fighter Command until 1966, when the site transferred to the Royal Engineers and became Waterbeach Barracks. The small Museum has closed, but its collection has been saved and put in storage.\n\nThe barracks closed on 28 March 2013, after a move by all the remaining Army units to RAF Kinloss in Scotland and to RAF Wittering in 2012–2013. The site is being used to provide 6,000–10,000 new homes.\n\nWaterbeach has expanded in recent years along with the economic growth in the region. It has increasingly become a dormitory for Cambridge. The village has several shops and businesses. There is a small industrial estate at the edge of the village and several small companies have premises in the village itself. Waterbeach Community Primary School has some 300 pupils. Adjacent to it is Waterbeach Independent Lending Library.\n\nAn Anglican Church of St John the Evangelist, a Baptist church famous for its ties with Charles Haddon Spurgeon, and a corps of the Salvation Army are present in the village. Active community groups include Scouts and Girl Guides, the Army Cadet Force, playgroups and a play scheme, and a Community Association. The Denny End industrial estate and Cambridge Innovation Park accommodate businesses such as the Milton Brewery and A&R Cambridge Ltd.

Set in Hollywood in the waning days of the silent screen era, it focuses on romantic lead Don Lockwood, his sidekick Cosmo Brown, aspiring actress Kathy Selden, and Lockwood's leading lady Lina Lamont, whose less-than-dulcet vocal tones make her an unlikely candidate for stardom in talking pictures.\n\nThe original West End production, directed by Tommy Steele and choreographed by Peter Gennaro, opened on June 30, 1983 at the London Palladium, where it ran until September 1985. The original cast included Steele as Don, Roy Castle as Cosmo, Danielle Carson as Kathy, and Sarah Payne as Lina and Julia. The original film's vocal score was embellished with additional tunes by Comden, Green, and Roger Edens, Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh, George and Ira Gershwin, Johnny Mercer and Richard Whiting, and Cole Porter.\n\n\"Singin' in the Rain \" opened on Broadway at the Gershwin Theatre on July 2, 1985 and closed on May 18, 1986 after 367 performances and 38 previews. Directed and choreographed by Twyla Tharp, the scenic design was by Santo Loquasto, costume design by Ann Roth, and lighting design by Jennifer Tipton. The cast included Don Correia as Don, Mary D'Arcy as Kathy, Peter Slutsker as Cosmo, and Faye Grant as Lina. The musical was dramatically revamped.\n\nThe 1983 London Palladium production was remounted in 1994 for an extensive tour of the United Kingdom, which ran until December 1995. The new production, again directed by Steele, starred Paul Nicholas as Don, Shona Lindsay as Kathy, Tony Howes as Cosmo with Sarah Payne reprising her role as Lina from the original cast. Supporting cast included Matt Zimmerman and Mark Donovan.\n\nA new production of the musical was staged at the Olivier Theatre (Royal National Theatre), from June 2, 2000 to July 20, 2000 and again from December 18, 2000 to January 27, 2001. This production was a transfer from the West Yorkshire production, which ran from December 1999 to February 2000. The cast featured Zoe Hart as Kathy, Rebecca Thornhill as Lina, and Paul Robinson as Don. The direction was by Jude Kelly, and choreography was by Stephen Mear. Thornhill received an Olivier Award nomination for her performance.\n\nThe musical played at Sadler's Wells Theatre from July 29, 2004 to September 4, 2004, with direction by Paul Kerryson and choreography by Adam Cooper (dancer), who also played the lead role of Don Lockwood. Cooper's choreography was nominated for the 2004 Critic's Circle National Dance award. The show later transferred to Leicester Haymarket.\n\nThe show was revived at the 2011 Chichester Festival Theatre, starring Adam Cooper, Daniel Crossley and Scarlett Strallen. It was choreographed by Andrew Wright who was nominated for an Olivier Award and won the WhatsOnStage award for his work. The show received positive reviews, and then transferred to London's West End, at the Palace Theatre, in February 2012, where Cooper, Crossley and Strallen all reprised their roles. \n\nThe rain, which first appeared it the 2011 Chichester Production, was designed and installed by specialists Water Sculptures Limited and the rain system features in the show's ongoing Pan Asia tour (2015) and the Moscow 2015 production.\n\nA UK tour followed the show closing on the West End starting on November 9 at the Manchester Opera House.\n\nThe Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris presented a new production from March 12–26, 2015, and again from November 27 to January 17, 2016, directed by Robert Carsen, choreography by Stephen Mear, and costumes by Anthony Powell. This production had been reportedly moving to Broadway in 2016. \"Playbill\" reported that the \"Broadway cast will be a combination of new and existing cast members from the Châtelet staging.\" No further details (theatre, dates) were announced.\n\nThis production faithfully reproduces the dialogue and action of the film, with its songs by Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed, and its famous splash-in-the-puddles, rain-drenched dance solo for Don Lockwood. A different production appeared on Broadway in 1985.\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported in November 2015 that the Théâtre du Châtelet production would transfer to Broadway in the fall of 2016, produced by Weinstein Live Entertainment. However, the musical's opening on Broadway was reportedly delayed in 2016 \"due to a lack of available theaters\"; at that time, the musical was still expected to open on Broadway. In October 2017, \"Playbill\" reported that the Théâtre du Châtelet had informed the magazine that a Broadway transfer produced by Weinstein Live Entertainment would not take place.\n\nThe 2012 London production will be revived at the Sadler's Wells Theatre with Adam Cooper reprising his role of Don Lockwood from 30 July to 5 September 2021. Preceding the London run, another UK tour will begin at the Marlowe Theatre, Canterbury from 21 January 2021. The Sadler's Wells production was delayed from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDon Lockwood is a silent film star with humble roots as a musician, dancer and stunt man. Don barely tolerates his vapid leading lady, Lina Lamont, who is convinced that their screen romance is real, although Don tries to tell her otherwise. After the first talking picture, \"The Jazz Singer\", proves to be a smash hit, the head of the studio, R. F. Simpson, decides he has no choice but to convert the new Lockwood and Lamont film, \"The Dueling Cavalier\", into a talkie. The production is beset with difficulties, by far the worst being Lina's comically grating voice.\n\nAfter a disastrous test screening, Don's best friend, Cosmo Brown, comes up with the idea to overdub Lina's voice and they convince Simpson to turn \"The Dueling Cavalier\" into \"The Dancing Cavalier\", a musical comedy film. Meanwhile, Don falls in love with an aspiring actress, Kathy Selden, who is providing the voice for Lina. When Lina finds out, she is furious and does everything possible to sabotage the romance. She maliciously demands that Kathy continue to provide her voice in all future films, but remain uncredited. An irate, but desperate Simpson is forced to agree; Kathy has no choice because she is under contract.\n\nThe premiere is a tremendous success. When the audience clamors for Lina to sing live, Don and Cosmo improvise and get Lina to lip-synch while Kathy sings into a second microphone while hidden behind the curtain. Unbeknownst to Lina, as she starts \"singing\", Don, Cosmo and Simpson gleefully raise the curtain behind her, revealing the deception. Kathy becomes a star, and Lina is finished.\n\nThe highlight of both productions was the recreation of the film's title tune sequence, complete with an on-stage rain shower. According to \"The New York Times\" review, \"The rain is wonderful. It descends from the flies of the Gershwin Theater in sheets at the end of Act I, drenching a Santo Loquasto courtyard set that floats beneath a distant, twinkling \"Hollywoodland\" sign...\"\n\nOf the London \"rain\" effect, a reviewer wrote: \"The stage downpour is so noisy -- and poses such a danger of microphone short circuits -- that Steele has to mime his song to a tape recording.\"\n\nThe Finger Lakes Musical Theatre Festival (Auburn, N.Y.) put on a production of the show in the summer of 2013 and created an effect where it rained indoors. The Festival puts on the show every ten years.\n\n\n\n"}

Young Stan realized that he wanted a show-business career while he was in grammar school, and after he graduated from Brooklyn's PS 49 in 1938, for the next two years he toured in vaudeville and found work in radio. He then joined the touring company of the \"Major Bowes Amateur Hour\". His career stalled in 1940, and Clements was reduced to panhandling for a time to survive. In 1941, he was signed to a contract by 20th Century Fox and appeared in juvenile/teen roles in several B films for the studio.\n\nIn 1942 he was loaned to Monogram Pictures and landed a recurring role as \"Stash\" in the ensemble cast film series, the East Side Kids. He appeared as an East Side Kid in \"Smart Alecks\", \"'Neath Brooklyn Bridge\", and \"Ghosts on the Loose\". Clements also appeared as a character named Stash in a few films unrelated to the East Side Kids, such as \"Right to the Heart\", 1950's \"Military Academy with That Tenth Avenue Gang\", and \"Boots Malone\".\n\nIn August 1945, Clements married actress Gloria Grahame, who played bad girl Violet Bick in \"It's a Wonderful Life\", and who later won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for \"The Bad and The Beautiful\". The marriage was a stormy one, with Grahame objecting to Clements's drinking and gambling, and Clements being jealous of her dalliances with other men, and it ended in 1948. He married Maria Walek in 1951, and in 1964 they adopted her then eight-year-old nephew, Sylvester, bringing him to the United States from Poland.\n\nAfter the East Side Kids, Clements then set out on his own again, this time landing roles in more prestigious pictures. He was featured in perhaps his best-known role as teenage street-tough-turned-choirboy \"Tony Scaponi\" in the 1944 Bing Crosby hit \"Going My Way\", and scored a great success as a jockey in the 1945 Alan Ladd feature \"Salty O'Rourke\".\n\nClements's acting career was interrupted by US Army service just after World War II, and when he returned in 1947, he began appearing in more adult roles in lower-budgeted films, including \"Johnny Holiday\" (cast against type as a psychopath) and \"Destination Murder\" (as a hired killer). He starred in a series of action/detective pictures at the successor to Monogram Pictures, Allied Artists for producer Ben Schwalb and director Edward Bernds.\n\nIn 1945 after Leo Gorcey left the East Side Kids in a contract dispute with producer Sam Katzman, Gorcey's teammate Bobby Jordan arranged a meeting with his agent, Jan Grippo. Gorcey partnered with Grippo to produce a new \"gang\" series called The Bowery Boys, with Gorcey owning a 40% share in the franchise. Gorcey's real-life father Bernard Gorcey was added to the cast as Louie Dumbrowski, proprietor of Louie's Sweet Shop, the headquarters of The Bowery Boys. Younger brother David Gorcey became one of the gang members. \n\nAfter Bernard Gorcey was killed in an auto accident in 1955, a grief-stricken Leo Gorcey turned to alcohol for solace and became a disruptive presence in the studio during the filming of \"Crashing Las Vegas\", trashing scenery and destroying props. In 1956 Gorcey demanded a larger share of ownership from Allied Artists, which was denied, and after a heated conversation, Gorcey stormed off the studio lot and quit the series.\n\nWhen the series's then-producer Ben Schwalb needed a replacement for Gorcey, he asked Stanley Clements to step in as The Bowery Boys' new ringleader, Stanislaus \"Duke\" Coveleskie (although Huntz Hall received top billing). Clements comfortably settled into the role of Huntz Hall's sidekick, and co-starred in the final seven Bowery Boys comedies, beginning with \"Fighting Trouble\".\n\nFollowing the end of The Bowery Boys franchise in 1958, Clements went on to a steady career of supporting roles in film and television. In 1960 Clements appeared as Clyde Simpson in the TV western \"Tales of Wells Fargo\" starring \"Dale Robertson\" in the episode called Doc Dawson. One of his last jobs was an appearance in a nationally advertised commercial for Pringle's potato chips. Clements co-wrote the 1958 film \"Devil's Partner\" that was not released until 1961.\n\nOn October 16, 1981 Stanley Clements died at age 55 from emphysema in Pasadena, California, 11 days after the passing of his first wife Gloria Grahame.

Until May 2006 he was contracted to Worcester Warriors for three seasons from 2005, but was released after one year of a three-year contract – an action which is still subject to potential legal action by Gomarsall. He was released by Harlequins F.C in 2009 and joined Leeds Carnegie for the 2009–2010 season to continue Guinness Premiership rugby.\n\nGomarsall sprang to prominence when he led the 1992 England Schools U18 team to their first Grand Slam in 11 years. The following season, he joined London Wasps and made his full England debut in 1996 against Italy. In 1997 he played in three Five Nations games and came on twice as a replacement on tour in Argentina.\n\nOn the club scene, he was a member of London Wasps’ 1999 Powergen Cup winning side, then transferred to Bedford, where he was captain, before being persuaded to join Gloucester Rugby. He was a Gloucester Rugby favourite, and took part in his second Powergen Cup triumph in 2003. He also started in the 2002 Zurich Championship Final (the year before winning the play-offs constituted winning the English title) in which Gloucester defeated Bristol Shoguns.\n\nIn 2002 Gomarsall re-ignited his England rugby career after a period of 27 months in the international wilderness, when he played in the 26–18 win over Argentina in Buenos Aires in June. He sealed his place as one of the three scrum halves for the World Cup with a strong performance in England's 43–9 defeat of Wales at the Millennium Stadium, during the World Cup warm up matches. He scored two tries in the 111–13 win over Uruguay in the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Brisbane.\n\nEmerging enhanced from his World Cup performances, Gomarsall was selected as England vice captain for the non-cap game against the New Zealand Barbarians in December 2003. Gomarsall started all three of England's 2004 Autumn internationals at Twickenham and was vice captain in the England XV against the Barbarians in May as well as the Churchill Cup tour.\n\nHowever, injury led to his replacement at both Gloucester Rugby and England, and so to prolong his career he signed a three-year deal with Worcester Warriors in June 2005. However, his injury worries returned to plague him, and he was released along with nine other players by Worcester in May 2006, two months short of the end of the season.\n\nOn 25 September 2006 Gomarsall signed a one year \"pay-as-you-play\" deal with Harlequins: \"\"\"It was shocking what happened to me and I wouldn't want that to happen to anyone else. I love rugby so much and have really missed it. I'm very grateful to Quins for giving me this opportunity.\"\".\n\nGomarsall performed well for Harlequins and was selected for the England squad for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. It was his kick down the touchline that enabled Josh Lewsey to score 5 points – the eventual winning margin for England that sent them into the final against South Africa on 20 October 2007.\n\nIn 2008, Gomarsall started the first two Six Nations games before being dropped for the third against France.\n\nIn 2015 Andy Gomarsall Played for Old Actonians RFC Vets in a dramatic thrashing of Local Rivals Ealing Vets.\n\nHe was a co-commentator for ITV's coverage of the 2011 Rugby World Cup.\n\nGomarsall is now building his Father's business, Network 2 Supplies Ltd. as a Director.\n\n"}
{"id": "1886874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1886874", "title": "Neutron capture", "text": "Neutron capture\n\nNeutron capture is a nuclear reaction in which an atomic nucleus and one or more neutrons collide and merge to form a heavier nucleus. Since neutrons have no electric charge, they can enter a nucleus more easily than positively charged protons, which are repelled electrostatically.\n\nNeutron capture plays an important role in the cosmic nucleosynthesis of heavy elements. In stars it can proceed in two ways: as a rapid (r-process) or a slow process (s-process). Nuclei of masses greater than 56 cannot be formed by thermonuclear reactions (i.e. by nuclear fusion), but can be formed by neutron capture.\nNeutron capture on protons yields a line at 2.223 MeV predicted and commonly observed in solar flares.\n\nAt small neutron flux, as in a nuclear reactor, a single neutron is captured by a nucleus. For example, when natural gold (Au) is irradiated by neutrons (n), the isotope Au is formed in a highly excited state, and quickly decays to the ground state of Au by the emission of gamma rays (γ). In this process, the mass number increases by one. This is written as a formula in the form Au+n → Au+γ, or in short form Au(n,γ)Au. If thermal neutrons are used, the process is called thermal capture.\n\nThe isotope Au is a beta emitter that decays into the mercury isotope Hg. In this process the atomic number rises by one.\n\nThe r-process happens inside stars if the neutron flux density is so high that the atomic nucleus has no time to decay via beta emission in between neutron captures. The mass number therefore rises by a large amount while the atomic number (i.e., the element) stays the same. When further neutron capture is no longer possible, the highly unstable nuclei decay via many β decays to beta-stable isotopes of higher-numbered elements.\n\nThe absorption neutron cross section of an isotope of a chemical element is the effective cross sectional area that an atom of that isotope presents to absorption, and is a measure of the probability of neutron capture. It is usually measured in barns (b).\n\nAbsorption cross section is often highly dependent on neutron energy. As a generality, the likelihood of absorption is proportional to the time the neutron is in the vicinity of the nucleus. The time spent in the vicinity of the nucleus is inversely proportional to the relative velocity between the neutron and nucleus. Other more specific issues modify this general principle. Two of the most commonly specified measures are the cross section for thermal neutron absorption, and resonance integral which considers the contribution of absorption peaks at certain neutron energies specific to a particular nuclide, usually above the thermal range, but encountered as neutron moderation slows the neutron down from an original high energy.\n\nThe thermal energy of the nucleus also has an effect; as temperatures rise, Doppler broadening increases the chance of catching a resonance peak. In particular, the increase in uranium-238's ability to absorb neutrons at higher temperatures (and to do so without fissioning) is a negative feedback mechanism that helps keep nuclear reactors under control.\n\nNeutron capture is involved in the formation of isotopes of chemical elements. As a consequence of this fact the energy of neutron capture intervenes in the standard enthalpy of formation of isotopes.\n\nNeutron activation analysis can be used to remotely detect the chemical composition of materials. This is because different elements release different characteristic radiation when they absorb neutrons. This makes it useful in many fields related to mineral exploration and security.\n\nThe most important neutron absorber is B as BC in control rods, or boric acid as a coolant water additive in PWRs. Other important neutron absorbers that are used in nuclear reactors are xenon, cadmium, hafnium, gadolinium, cobalt, samarium, titanium, dysprosium, erbium, europium, molybdenum and ytterbium; all of which usually consist of mixtures of various isotopes—some of which are excellent neutron-absorbers. These also occur in combinations such as MoB, hafnium diboride, titanium diboride, dysprosium titanate and gadolinium titanate.\n\nHafnium, one of the last stable elements to be discovered, presents an interesting case. Even though hafnium is a heavier element, its electron configuration makes it practically identical with the element zirconium, and they are always found in the same ores. However, their nuclear properties are different in a profound way. Hafnium absorbs neutrons avidly (Hf absorbs 600 times more than Zr), and it can be used in reactor control rods, whereas natural zirconium is practically transparent to neutrons. So, zirconium is a very desirable construction material for reactor internal parts, including the metallic cladding of the fuel rods which contain either uranium, plutonium, or mixed oxides of the two elements (MOX fuel).\n\nHence, it is quite important to be able to separate the zirconium from the hafnium in their naturally occurring alloy. This can only be done inexpensively by using modern chemical ion-exchange resins. Similar resins are also used in reprocessing nuclear fuel rods, when it is necessary to separate uranium and plutonium, and sometimes thorium.\n\n\n"}

It is a \"trans-peninsular\" highway in that it travels through an agricultural area from Bay Port on Saginaw Bay to Harbor Beach on Lake Huron. The current trunkline in Huron County was originally parts of other state highways that date back to the initial 1919 signposting of the state highway system in the state. The designation was applied in 1939, and the road has remained unchanged since it was completely paved in the 1950s. One other highway, near Lake City, carried the number in the 1930s.\n\nM-142 begins just a few miles south of Bay Port at an intersection with M-25 near the Bay Port Cemetery, about two-thirds of a mile (1.1 km) inland from Saginaw Bay. From there, the road travels eastward through farm country on Pigeon Road. The highway follows a direct course over the Pigeon River to the village of Pigeon, when M-142 turns south on Main Street to exit town. South of town, the Pigeon Road name resumes, and after about , M-142 turns back eastward near the Grand Lawn Cemetery. The road then continues eastward through more farms to Elkton, diverting off a direct course to cross a line of the Huron and Eastern Railway on the east side of town.\n\nNorth of Bad Axe, M-142 leaves Pigeon Road to turn southward along Van Dyke Road for about mile and a half (2.4 km). Along this section, the highway runs concurrently with M-53 into town. At the intersection with Huron Avenue, M-142 turns east and M-53 turns west, ending the overlap of the two highways. M-142 exits town and follows Sand Beach Road through farm country. About of Bad Axe, M-142 meets the northern terminus of M-19 (Ubly Road). Continuing eastward, the highway crosses two branches of the Willow River as it passes through the unincorporated community of Verona. East of that location, the trunkline turns northeasterly, roughly parallel to the Rock Falls Creek, as it angles to Harbor Beach. M-142 follows State Street through town, and the trunkline terminates at the intersection with M-25 about a quarter mile (0.4 km) west of Lake Huron.\n\nLike other state highways in Michigan, M-142 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on average, 8,887 vehicles used the highway daily in the city of Bad Axe east of M-53 and 832 vehicles did so each day between M-25 and Pigeon, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively. No section of M-142 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.\n\nThe first highway to gain the M-142 moniker was designated by the end of 1929 running eastward from M-55/M-66 to a farm owned by Michigan State College (now Michigan State University) south of Lake City. By 1939, this highway was transferred back to local control.\n\nWhen the state highway system was first signed in 1919, one of the original trunklines was numbered M-31, originally running northward from Port Huron to Harbor Beach and then westward to Saginaw. When the U.S. Highway System was approved on November 11, 1926, M-31 was decommissioned in favor of alternate numbers. The roadway between Bay Port and Harbor Beach was assigned the M-83 designation; Between Bay Port and Bad Axe, the highway was also a part of the contemporary M-29. By 1933, the M-29 designation was removed when that highway was realigned to follow the Saginaw Bay shoreline and later became parts of an extended US Highway 25 (US 25) and a new M-25.\n\nIn 1939, a section of M-83 was returned to local control, which would have resulted in a discontinuous routing. Segments of the trunkline were absorbed into other existing highways. The former routing of M-83 from Bay Port, eastward across The Thumb, to Harbor Beach where it met up with US 25 was redesignated M-142.

{"id": "1886885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1886885", "title": "Frisian handball", "text": "Frisian handball\n\nFrisian handball (; ) is a traditional Frisian sport, related to American handball and fives, that is most commonly practiced by people from the northern Dutch province of Friesland (\"Fryslân\"). It is believed to be one of the oldest ballgames and was an unofficial demonstration sport at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. The score is similar to tennis. The first team scoring six games wins the match.\n\nThe major Frisian handball tournament, called the P.C. (short for Permanent Committee), has been held in the city of Franeker since 1854 and is considered the oldest regular sports tournament in the world.\n\nFrisian handball is played on a rectangular lawn of 61 meters by 32 meters, by two teams composed of 3 players. In the center of one short side of the field is a receiving zone of 5 meters by 19 meters defended by 2 players, the other team member remaining field player. One of the opponents serves the hard leather ball with his bare hand from a serving box at about 30 meters from the receiving zone. If he does not succeed in reaching the receiving zone, the receiving team gets a direct score. When the receiving team, of which the players are allowed to wear a single hardened leather glove, returns the ball over the short line behind the serving box (called the upper line, in West Frisian \"boppe\") they also get a direct score. Of course, the serving team is allowed to prevent this happening by hitting or holding the ball before the upper line. The place where the ball remains after such a rally is marked with a small woodblock called a \"kaats\", which is best defined as an undecided score. When two such undecided points occur (or one, if one of the teams is on game point) the teams change places.\nIn the next rally, the team that then has the receiving position, tries to hit the ball past the first \"kaats\" and, if any, in the next rally past the second \"kaats\", so deciding the undecided points. Then they start all over again.\n\nIn parts of Belgium, the similar game of jeu de balle-pelote is played. This game is played by teams of 5 players on a trapezium shaped field, mostly located on marketplaces.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1886892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1886892", "title": "Warriors (novel series)", "text": "Warriors (novel series)\n\nWarriors is a series of novels based around the adventures and drama of several groups (Clans) of wild cats. The series is primarily set in the fictional location of White Hart Woods, and, later, Sanctuary Lake. The series is published by HarperCollins and written by authors Kate Cary, Cherith Baldry, and Tui T. Sutherland, with the plot developed by editor Victoria Holmes under the collective pseudonym Erin Hunter.\n\nThere are currently seven sub-series, each containing six books except for the seventh sub-series, which is currently in progress. The first, \"Warriors\" (later re-titled \"Warriors: The Prophecies Begin\"), was published from 2003 to 2004, and details the adventures of a kittypet (housecat) named Rusty, who joins one of the warrior cat Clans, ThunderClan. \"Warriors: The New Prophecy\", published from 2005 to 2006, follows the first sub-series, chronicling the Clans' journey to a new home. The third story arc, \"Warriors: Power of Three\", was published from 2007 to 2009, and centres around a prophecy about three cats with extraordinary powers. The fourth sub-series, \"Warriors: Omen of the Stars\", was published from 2009 to 2012 and continues the story arc of \"Warriors: Power of Three\". The fifth sub-series, \"Warriors: Dawn of the Clans\", was published from 2013 to 2015. This prequel series arc details the formation of the Clans. The sixth sub-series, \"Warriors: A Vision of Shadows,\" was published from 2016 to 2018. Chronologically, \"Warriors: A Vision of Shadows\" follows \"Warriors: Omen of the Stars\". The seventh sub-series is entitled \"Warriors: The Broken Code\". The first book in the seventh series, \"Lost Stars\", was released on 9 April 2019. The next book in \"Warriors: The Broken Code\" is \"Silent Thaw\". After that is \"Veil of Shadows\" and the fourth book, \"Darkness Within\" has not been released yet.\n\nOther books have been released in addition to the main series, including eleven lengthier stand-alone \"Super Edition\" novels, several e-book novellas later published in five print compilations, six guide books, and several volumes of original English-language manga, initially produced as a collaboration between HarperCollins and TOKYOPOP before the latter's closure. The series has also been translated into several languages. Alibaba Pictures has acquired the film rights to the series as of 2016.\n\nMajor themes in the series include adventure, forbidden love, the concept of nature vs. nurture, acceptance, the struggle of good vs. evil, the reactions of different faiths meeting each other, and all people being a mix of good and bad. The authors draw inspiration from several natural locations and other authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien, J. K. Rowling, and William Shakespeare.\n\n\"Warriors\" has received mostly positive reviews, but it has also been criticized for being confusing due to its large number of characters and complex relationships. Critics have compared it to the \"Redwall\" series. Although nominated for several awards, \"Warriors\" has yet to receive any major literary prizes. Several novels in the series have reached the \"New York Times\" Bestseller List, and the series has found popularity in many countries, including Trinidad, the U.K, Germany, and China.\n\nThe series first began when publisher HarperCollins asked Victoria Holmes to write a fantasy series about feral cats. Holmes was initially not enthusiastic, since she \"couldn't imagine coming up with enough ideas\". She worked with the concept, however, expanding the storyline with elements of war, politics, revenge, doomed love, and religious conflict. Although the original plan was for a stand-alone novel, enough material was created for several books, and the publisher decided on a six-volume series. The first volume, \"Into the Wild\", was written by Kate Cary under the pseudonym \"Erin Hunter\" and was completed in about three months. Holmes then began to work behind the scenes, editing and supervising details. Cherith Baldry joined the team to write the third book, \"Forest of Secrets\". Later, after she wrote the first \"Warriors\" field guide, Tui Sutherland became the fourth author to use the pseudonym Erin Hunter.\n\nThe authors have named several other authors as sources of inspiration when writing the novels. In an online author chat, Cherith Baldry listed the authors that inspire her as including Tolkien, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Shakespeare. In the same chat, Victoria Holmes stated that Jacqueline Wilson, Kathy Reichs, and J. K. Rowling are some of the authors that inspire her. According to the official website, other authors who have inspired the writers include Enid Blyton, Lucy Daniels, Ellis Peters, Tess Gerritsen, Kate Ellis, Lisa Gardiner, and Meg Cabot. The authors have also mentioned several other sources of inspiration. The New Forest in southern England was the base for the forest where the original series took place. Other influential locations include Loch Lomond, as well as the Scottish Highlands. Nicholas Culpeper, a physician who used materials occurring in the natural world as medicine, also had an influence on the \"Warriors\" series. His book, \"Culpeper's Herbal\", is used as a source by the authors for the many herbal remedies that the cats use in the books. In addition, the authors suggested that they may use some fan-created character names in future books. The film series Rambo has also been cited as a source of inspiration.\n\nThe \"Warriors\" universe centres around a large group of feral cats who initially reside in a forest, and later, around a lake after fleeing their initial home due to its destruction by humans. The cats are split into four groups called Clans: ThunderClan lives in woodland areas, WindClan resides on the moors, RiverClan by the river, and ShadowClan within and around the swamps. SkyClan, a subsequently introduced fifth group, is revealed to have been a part of this system but was forced to flee when their territory was destroyed by humans for urban development. Each Clan has adapted to their own terrain. For example, RiverClan cats, swim in the river to catch fish, while the majority of cats from the other Clans fear and avoid bodies of water. On the other hand, WindClan cats are faster runners, allowing them to catch rabbits and hares on the open moors of their territory. Relationships between different Clans are tense and they often come into conflict with one another. However, the Clans also sometimes show concern for each other; the idea of one Clan being destroyed usually causes deep distress and prompts urgent action on behalf of all four Clans.\n\nThe Clan cats have a faith system based on the concept of StarClan, a group of the spirits of the Clans' deceased ancestors, who provide guidance to the living Clan cats, usually those of the Clan in which they resided in life. After death, the spirits of most Clan cats join StarClan and reside in a paradisiacal forest. StarClan often provides guidance to the Clans through dreams and other signs like omens, most often directed towards each Clan's medicine cats, part of whose role it is to commune with StarClan, in addition to providing medical care to their Clan. In addition to StarClan, there exists the Dark Forest, also known as The Place of No Stars, which takes the form of a never-ending forest. The spirits of cats who caused great pain and suffering to others while alive walk alone there as a form of punishment. Although cats of the Dark Forest are meant to be isolated as punishment, they eventually learn how to appear in the dreams of living cats much the way StarClan does.\n\nCats who live outside of the Clans are categorized into three groups. Housecats, referred to as \"kittypets\" by Clan cats, are often looked down upon by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy lifestyle. \"Loners\" are feral cats who live outside of the Clans, usually by themselves. They are often regarded by the Clans with suspicion. Similar to loners are \"rogues\", who differ in that they try to cause the Clan cats harm. It is rare, though not unheard of, for a kittypet, loner, or rogue to join a Clan, as outsiders are generally distrusted by Clan cats. In several instances, Clans that have taken in outsiders have been met with scorn by the other Clans.\n\nBeyond the Clans' territories lies a mountain range, inhabited by the Tribe of Rushing Water (often referred to simply as the Tribe), a group of cats who follow a different set of ancestors: the Tribe of Endless Hunting. The Tribe has a different hierarchical structure than the Clans, consisting of a Healer, cave-guards, and prey-hunters, who each serve a different function in the Tribe. The Healer leads the Tribe, heals the ill and wounded, and communicates with the Tribe of Endless Hunting; the cave-guards defend the Tribe and the prey-hunters hunt for the Tribe. In a subsequent prequel series, it is revealed that the Tribe was formed by the predecessors of the Clans when they left the lake territory to live in the mountains. In turn, cats from the Tribe later moved to the forest of the original series and formed the Clans.\n\nThe original \"Warriors\" series, later re-titled \"Warriors: The Prophecies Begin\", was released from 2003 to 2004 and consists of six books: \"Into the Wild\" (21 January 2003), \"Fire and Ice\" (27 May 2003), \"Forest of Secrets\" (14 October 2003), \"Rising Storm\" (6 January 2004), \"A Dangerous Path\" (1 June 2004), and \"The Darkest Hour\" (5 October 2004). The series was subtitled \"The Prophecies Begin\" for its re-release with new covers in 2015. The series details the experiences of a housecat named Rusty who ventures into the forest and is invited to join ThunderClan, one of four groups of wild cats in the forest. Throughout the series, he rises through the Clan hierarchy while attempting to uncover and later stop the treachery of his Clanmate Tigerclaw, who intends initially to usurp ThunderClan's leadership and later plans to take over all the Clans.\n\nThe second series, \"Warriors: The New Prophecy\", was released from 2005 to 2006 and consists of six books: \"Midnight\" (10 May 2005), \"Moonrise\" (1 August 2005), \"Dawn\" (27 December 2005), \"Starlight\" (4 April 2006), \"Twilight\" (22 August 2006), and \"Sunset\" (26 December 2006). In this series, the Clans' survival is put at risk as humans begin to destroy their forest home with machinery. The series revolves around a group of cats, consisting of Tawnypelt of ShadowClan, Crowpaw (later Crowfeather) of WindClan, Feathertail of RiverClan, and Brambleclaw of ThunderClan, and joined by Feathertail’s brother, Stormfur, and ThunderClan apprentice Squirrelpaw (later Squirreflight), brought together by visions from StarClan to embark on a quest to find a new home for the Clans. The series also details the Clans' subsequent journey to find their new lakeside territories, before introducing a new prophecy that \"blood will spill blood and the lake will run red\", foreshadowing a conflict between Brambleclaw and his half-brother Hawkfrost, who plans to follow in their father Tigerstar's footsteps and take over the Clans.\n\nThe third series, \"Warriors: Power of Three\", was released from 2007 to 2009 and consists of six books: \"The Sight\" (24 April 2007), \"Dark River\" (26 December 2007), \"Outcast\" (22 April 2008), \"Eclipse\" (2 September 2008), \"Long Shadows\" (25 November 2008), and \"Sunrise\" (21 April 2009). The plot is centred on the prophecy \"There will be three, kin of your kin, who hold the power of the stars in their paws\", which was given to Firestar in the standalone novel \"Firestar's Quest\", which takes place between the original \"Warriors\" arc and \"Warriors: The New Prophecy\". The prophecy refers to Firestar's grandchildren, who discover over the course of the series that they each have unique supernatural abilities. Jayfeather, who, despite being congenitally blind, can sense others' emotions and enter their dreams, first learns of the prophecy when he enters Firestar's dream. Believing the prophecy refers to him and his siblings, the series details their efforts to discover his siblings' abilities. They discover that Lionblaze is invulnerable to injury during battle, but, despite their efforts, ultimately conclude that their sister Hollyleaf does not possess any special ability, and thus that the prophecy refers to a yet-undiscovered third cat, a plot point further explored in the subsequent series, \"Warriors: Omen of the Stars\".\n\nThe fourth series, \"Warriors: Omen of the Stars\", was released from 2009 to 2012 and consists of six books: \"The Fourth Apprentice\" (24 November 2009), \"Fading Echoes\" (23 March 2010), \"Night Whispers\" (23 November 2010), \"Sign of the Moon\" (5 April 2011), \"The Forgotten Warrior\" (22 November 2011), and \"The Last Hope\" (3 April 2012). The series continues the plot of \"\", after it is discovered at the end of the previous series that Lionblaze and Jayfeather's sister, Hollyleaf, does not have a special power, and is thus not the third cat foretold in the prophecy \"There will be three, kin of your kin, who hold the power of the stars in their paws\". The series begins with Jayfeather and Lionblaze's discovery that the third cat foretold in the prophecy is Dovepaw, one of Firestar's great-grandnieces, when she is discovered to possess the ability of clairvoyance. The trio learn throughout the course of the series that the cats of the Dark Forest, who are spirits of deceased Clan cats who committed acts of evil during their lives, are preparing an attack on the living Clan cats, recruiting disgruntled living cats to their cause, brutally training them for battle in their dreams, and manipulating the Clans through these cats. Jayfeather receives a vision informing him that there will be a fourth cat integral to the prophecy, who is ultimately revealed during the climactic battle between the Dark Forest and Clans to be Firestar himself, whose defeat of Tigerstar's spirit concludes the battle in the Clans' favour, though Firestar is mortally wounded in the process.\n\nThe fifth series, \"Warriors: Dawn of the Clans\", was released from 5 March 2013 to 1 September 2015 and consists of six books: \"The Sun Trail\" (5 March 2013), \"Thunder Rising\" (5 November 2013), \"The First Battle\" (8 April 2014), \"The Blazing Star\" (4 November 2014), \"A Forest Divided\" (7 April 2015), and \"Path of Stars\" (1 September 2015). It mainly features around cats of the old times but mostly Gray Wing, Clear Sky, and Thunder.\n\n\"Warriors: A Vision of Shadows\" is the sixth sub-series. The series was originally titled, \"Warriors: StarClan's Promise\". The first book, \"The Apprentice's Quest\", which takes place approximately eight months after \"Bramblestar's Storm,\" was released on 15 March 2016. The books' main characters are Sparkpaw/Sparkpelt and Alderpaw/Alderheart who are Bramblestar's and Squirrelflight's children. Later on, Twigkit/Twigpaw/Twigbranch and Violetkit/Violetpaw/Violetshine, who are later discovered to be lost SkyClan cats, also become main characters. The first book, \"The Apprentice's Quest,\" starts with each Clan's medicine cats receiving a prophecy from StarClan together, telling them to \"Embrace what you find in the shadows, for only they can clear the sky\". The following books are \"Thunder and Shadow\" (September 6, 2016), \"Shattered Sky\" (11 April 2017), \"Darkest Night\" (November 7, 2017), \"River of Fire\" (10 April 2018) and \"The Raging Storm\" (6 November 2018).\n\n\"Warriors: The Broken Code\" is the seventh sub-series. The first book, \"Lost Stars\" was released on 9 April 2019. This series revolves around Bristlepaw/Bristlefrost, a ThunderClan apprentice/warrior, Rootpaw/Rootspring, a SkyClan apprentice/warrior, and Shadowpaw/Shadowsight, a ShadowClan medicine cat apprentice. The second book, \"The Silent Thaw\" was released on 29 October 2019. The third instalment, \"Veil of Shadows\", was published on 7 April 2020. It revolves around the ThunderClan’s leader, Bramblestar, who has been behaving erratically after losing one of his nine lives. Suspicion is quickly spreading across Clan borders. And when a strange apparition sparks unrest in SkyClan and ShadowClan, each warrior must decide where their allegiances lie—with their Clan, or the warrior code itself. With the each clan member taking sides, will the accusations ever end?\n\nSuper Editions are stand-alone books in the \"Warriors\" series that are approximately double the length of a normal \"Warriors\" book, about 500 pages long. The first Super Edition was \"Firestar's Quest\", about Firestar going on a quest to reform Skyclan. Other super editions include \"Bramblestar's Storm\", about newly appointed Bramblestar learning how to lead his clan through hardship, \"Yellowfang's Secret\", about a Shadowclan medicine cat who gave birth to a kit who murdered his own father and very nearly destroyed his entire clan with his vicious conquests, and \"Bluestar's Prophecy\", about Bluestar, Thunderclan's leader before Firestar, when she was young, ambitious, and a fool in love. Finally \"Tigerheart's Shadow\"\n\nIn addition, multiple field guides have been published. The guides offer extra information, usually in the form of short stories, and are usually about 150 pages long. They include \n\nSeveral series of original English-language manga have been produced by HarperCollins with TOKYOPOP. With the shutdown of TOKYOPOP, subsequent manga volumes have been published under the HarperCollins name alone. The manga series consists of several sub-series, \"Graystripe's Adventure\", \"Tigerstar and Sasha\", \"Ravenpaw's Path\", and \"Skyclan and the Stranger\", each with three books, as well as the stand-alone, \"The Rise of Scourge\" by prolific writer Dan Jolley.\n\nOriginally published only in e-book format, the novellas were later published in anthology volumes.\n\nThe first book of the series, \"Into the Wild\", was generally well-received, with reviewers calling it a \"spine-tingling,\" \"thoroughly engrossing\" and \"exciting... action-packed adventure.\" One reviewer praised the authors for \"creating an intriguing world... and an engaging young hero\", but another criticised the characters and imagined world as being \"neither... consistent nor compelling.\"\n\nThe manga has also earned praise: a reviewer for \"Children's Bookwatch\" noted that \"Into the Woods\" \"ends on a tense cliffhanger, leaving the reader in anxious anticipation for more. Suitable for readers age ten to one hundred and ten, warriors Tigerstar and Sasha's manga story, #1: Into the Woods, is especially recommended for cat lovers everywhere\". Its sequel, \"Escape from the Forest\", was also well reviewed: a reviewer for \"Publishers Weekly\" believed that girls would benefit from reading about Sasha leaving the powerful Tigerstar due to his \"growing violence\". The art was also praised, with the reviewer writing that \"Hudson's artwork brings Sasha's emotional journey to life, showing each moment of fear, anxiety, contentment, and joy. The cat's-eye perspective of many of the panels, in addition, add a dramatic, energizing element to the book\". The reviewer also wrote that \"a twist at the end will leave fans eager for the next installment of Sasha's saga\", and that the book would appeal to young adults trying to find their place in the world. Lisa Goldstein for \"School Library Journal\" also gave the book a positive review, writing that the plot would attract new fans and appeal to old fans. The reviewer also wrote that \"though the cover claims that this is a 'manga,' the straightforward illustrations are drawn in a simple, realistic style\".\n\nThe large number of characters involved in the series has often been seen as a negative point; though one reviewer compared the \"huge cast\" to that of a Greek drama, others wrote that it was \"hard to follow\" and \"a little confusing.\" The characters have also been criticised as being \"somewhat flat\" and \"limited essentially to each individual's function within the clan.\"\n\nAs one reviewer put it, the cats in the series are \"true to their feline nature,\" leading some critics to jokingly comment that the books will \"leave readers eyeing Puss a bit nervously\" and wondering \"what dreams of grandeur may haunt the family cat.\" However, this realism also means that the series contains a relatively large amount of violence, with one critic stating that it is \"not for the faint of heart.\" Several critics have compared \"Warriors\" to Brian Jacques' \"Redwall\" series, though one commented that it was \"not as elegantly written.\" \"The New York Times\" called the series a \"hit with young readers\", specifically because of its \"sprawling universe\", and the series was able to appear on the \"New York Times\" Bestseller List for a total of 117 weeks, as of 24 November 2013.\n\n\"Into the Wild\" was nominated for the Pacific Northwest Library Association's 2006 Young Reader's Choice Awards but lost to Christopher Paolini's \"Eragon\". It was also listed on \"Booklist\"s Top 10 fantasy books for youth in 2003 and was a Book Sense 76 Pick.\n\"The Sight\" was nominated for the best Middle Readers book in Amazon's Best Books of the Year (2007) and placed sixth out of the ten nominees, with six percent of the total votes. It was also nominated for the Children's Choice Book Awards. In 2006, \"Warriors\" also received an honorable mention for the best book series for \"Publisher Weekly's\" \"On the Cuff\" awards.\n\nThemes in the series often revolve around forbidden love. These relationships are not allowed for various reasons: some involve medicine cats, who are not allowed to have mates according to the medicine cat code, while others develop between cats in different Clans, which is also forbidden by the warrior code (for example, Graystripe of ThunderClan and Silverstream of RiverClan). Holmes said that another central theme of the series is \"faith and spirituality\" in StarClan. All books in the series feature the influence of StarClan, not just as the cats think of them, but in terms of prophecies delivered by StarClan which inevitably come true. Some scenes take place within StarClan's realm, with no living cats present as point-of-view characters. Thus the existence of an afterlife and the influence of spirits who have passed on and yet retain their earthly identities is integral to all of the plot arcs in the series. Another idea explored in the novels is the reactions of different faiths when meeting each other. For example, the Tribe of Rushing Water, which believes in different spiritual ancestors than the Clans, is introduced in \"Moonrise\". In an author chat, Holmes explained that the books never say that either of the Clans or the Tribe of Rushing Water is right about faith because both are \"equally valid.\" This leads to fear and suspicion between them because they are afraid of things they do not understand. Holmes said that \"ignorance is a very scary thing!\" Non-belief is also significant in the storylines: Mothwing and Cloudtail do not believe in StarClan. Kittypets, loners, and rouges were also a very important theme (at least for Erin Hunter).\n\nAnother theme is that characters can be a mix of good and evil. Holmes has said she is fascinated by these \"shades of gray\" in personalities. Her example of this was when Bluestar, a noble and honorable cat, gave up her kits for her own ambitions so an evil cat would not take over. Another example she gave of this is how the antagonist Tigerstar, even with all of his faults, is still courageous and fiercely loyal. Similarly, Holmes has also connected the theme to Brambleclaw and how nobody knew whether he was good or evil. A third major theme, often referred to as nature versus nurture, explores whether a person is born the way he or she will be, or if other things shape that. For example, Brambleclaw's father is the evil Tigerstar, but he eventually demonstrates that despite this, he is not evil himself, despite initial suspicion from Clanmates due to his father's legacy. This theme ties into the \"shades of gray\" theme. similar to the book ¨Forest dogs¨.\n\nA reviewer for \"Publishers Weekly\" noted that friendship and responsibility are taught to characters in the novels, while booksforyouths.com had a reviewer who pointed out the idea that, just as Clan cats shun house cats for their soft life, people should realize that it is necessary to experience hardship in life. A Storysnoops review noted that one of the themes was that \"it doesn't matter where you come from, only who you are inside\". In \"Dawn\", the importance of cooperation is explored. The four Clans, normally hostile to each other, are forced to work together in order to find a new home. Other themes that have been pointed out deal with family, loss, honor, bravery, death, loyalty, and following rules.\n\nHolmes has said that one of the good things about writing a book about cats is that \"we can tackle difficult human issues such as death, racial intolerance, and religious intolerance [without seeming so heavy].\"\n\nAll of the \"Warriors\" books except for the manga have been published as hardcovers, and the majority of them have also been published as paperbacks. \"Starlight\", \"Twilight\", and \"Sunset\" from \"The New Prophecy\", as well as the first four \"Omen of the Stars\" books, are available in an audiobook format. The \"New Prophecy\" audiobooks are spoken by Nanette Savard, whose performance has been praised by reviewers. A reviewer for \"AudioFile\" wrote: \"Nanette Savard brings out the youth of the cats who are struggling to help their clan survive and to protect each other from outside danger.\" The \"Omen of the Stars\" audiobooks are spoken by Veronica Taylor who played Ash Ketchum and many anime and cartoon characters . The books in the four main series have also been released in an e-book format.\n\nThe \"Warriors\" series was first published in the United States and United Kingdom. The editions published of the first two series—\"Warriors\" and \"Warriors: The New Prophecy\"—in the United Kingdom had slight variations in cover design from their United States counterparts. \"Warriors\" is also sold in New Zealand, Australia, and Canada. Translations from English into other languages such as Czech, Norwegian, Lithuanian, Finnish, Japanese, French, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, and Korean have been published more recently. The first six books have been published in Italy and Latin America, the first five series in Germany and the first four series in the Netherlands. Fandom also exists in Trinidad and Singapore. The first two books have been published in Poland, and the first two series have been published in Korean.\n\nThe \"Warriors\" website features \"Warriors\" screensavers, along with videos on the process of writing a manga book and a video promoting \"The Last Hope\". There is also a \"How To Draw Manga\" page. In addition, there are games, including quizzes, the \"New Prophecy Adventure\", and the \"Warriors Adventure Game\". On the Frequently Asked Questions section of the site, Erin Hunter said that they are working on an online game that would be released in late 2010. It finished the first round of testing in summer 2010, but has not been released. Whether it will be a role-playing game is unknown. Erin Hunter has stated on the official \"Warriors\" website that there is still no plan for an official video game, but if there was, it would probably be based on a movie version of the \"Warriors\" series, which was at the time not under consideration. Many fans have resorted to making their own games and websites, many of these sites being Play-by-post role-playing game forums.\n\nOn 20 October 2016, Victoria Holmes announced that Alibaba Pictures had bought the production rights for a film adaptation with David Heyman as producer. On 14 May 2018 it was announced that STX Entertainment had come on board to co-produce the film, with STX board member Gigi Pritzker working alongside Heyman. It was also announced that screenwriters Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger would write the screenplay for the movie. No director or release date has yet been announced for the film.\n\nThe first short story written by Erin Hunter is \"Spottedleaf's Honest Answer\". In it, the spirit of former ThunderClan medicine cat Spottedleaf discusses her love for Firestar. It gives information on what happened in the \"Warriors\" series from \"Into the Wild\" to \"Firestar's Quest\".\n\nOn 20 January 2009, another short story, \"The Clans Decide\", was released on the \"Warriors Ultimate Leader Election\" site, starring Firestar, who won an election through an online fan vote conducted in recognition of President Obama's Inauguration Day. In the story, the four Clans vote for a way to survive a tough winter. Every cat at the meeting votes on whether or not the Clans should work together to survive the winter. The cats vote in favour of working together.\n\nTwo short stories, \"After Sunset: The Right Choice?\" and \"The Elders' Concern\", are included with the \"Warriors\" mobile application. \"The Elders' Concern\" has been noted to contain timeline errors. Taking place after Bluestar's selection of Fireheart for deputy, it is about the elder Halftail, who is unhappy with the decision, and wakes the other elders to discuss it with them. In \"After Sunset: The Right Choice?\", After Brambleclaw is forced to kill Hawkfrost, he is worried about what Firestar might do, but Firestar is extremely proud of him.\n\nWritten by Victoria Holmes for a tour, a play titled \"After Sunset: We Need to Talk\" was first premiered on 28 April 2007 at the Secret Garden bookstore in Seattle, Washington. It details a meeting between Leafpool of ThunderClan and Crowfeather of WindClan after the events of \"Sunset\". The script was released to the public on the official site for the \"Warriors\" series.\n\nDuring a fundraising event in Russellville, Arkansas, \"Brightspirit's Mercy\" was performed by various high school drama students. The second of two plays by Erin Hunter, \"Brightspirit's Mercy\" is about Jaypaw, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf. After going to a Gathering, where it is obvious all of the Clans except for ThunderClan are starving, three cats from StarClan appear to them: Brightspirit and her parents, Shiningheart and Braveheart, characters created on \"Wands and Worlds\", a fantasy fiction forum, in memory of a 10-year-old \"Warriors\" fan, Emmy Grace Cherry, and her parents, Dana and Jimmy Cherry, who were killed in a tornado in February 2007. They tell the three young cats that they must help feed the other Clans. Jaypaw is easily convinced, but Hollyleaf and Lionblaze are harder to win over. Eventually, they agree and hunt, then wait at the WindClan border for a patrol. Ashfoot, WindClan's deputy, accepts the gift, but Breezepaw, too proud to have help from another Clan, refuses to eat it. Jaypaw, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf then head towards another Clan's territory.\n\nIn the Chinese translation of the series, \"3-D trading cards\" are packaged in each book.

The show is about a rich Manhattan couple, Oliver and Lisa Douglas, who decide to buy and run a farm in the eccentric and surreal town of Hooterville.\n\nHank Kimball (played by Alvy Moore) is an unusual, perhaps unique, comic creation. He is friendly and eager-to-please, but he is highly scatterbrained and appears to have been educated beyond his intelligence. He has an unusual self-correcting manner where he makes a statement, then qualifies it, then corrects it, then corrects it further, and finally loses track of what he was saying entirely. The \"Encyclopedia of Television\" states that Kimball \"personifies a kind of infinite regress, where every empirical statement branches into multiple statements that in turn preclude it, spiraling each new observation back and away from itself like an inductive Escherism.\" \n\nHank Kimball was a more straightforward character when \"Green Acres\" first began. Over the course of the first season, however, he gradually changes into a scatterbrained flake who cannot seem to remember anything, unless, as Oliver Douglas figures out, you specifically tell him \"not\" to remember it. He frequently forgets Oliver's name while he is talking to him and has to ask him his name. Although Kimball is supposedly a farming expert, his advice is usually worthless. For example, in one episode, Oliver has children visiting his farm from New York City. He lets each one plant a small garden. Kimball comes and tells them he is the county agent and can tell them anything they would like to know about farming. A child asks how seeds know what to grow into. Kimball replies that the seeds just look at the pictures on the seed packs.\n"}

While the degree has a major focus on computers and technology, it differs from a Computer Science degree in that students are also expected to study management and information science, and there are reduced requirements for mathematics. A degree in computer science can be expected to concentrate on the scientific aspects of computing, while a degree in information technology can be expected to concentrate on the business and communication applications of computing. There is more emphasis on these two areas in the e-commerce, e-business and business information technology undergraduate courses. Specific names for the degrees vary across countries, and even universities within countries.\n\nThis is in contrast to a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology which is a bachelor's degree typically conferred after a period of three to four years of an undergraduate course of study in Information Technology (IT). The degree itself is a Bachelor of Science with institutions conferring degrees in the fields of information technology and related fields.\n\nIn BIT is a three-year or four-year undergraduate degree.\n\nAt the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS), a BIT\nAt the University of New South Wales a BIT is referred to as \"Business in Information technology\" and is also a co-op scholarship degree that lasts four years.\n\nAt the University of Sydney a BIT is a four-year technical program, related to degrees such as Computer Science and Software Engineering.\n\nAt Swinburne University of Technology, a BIT is a three-year co-op scholarship degree incorporating two six-month job placements.\n\nAt RMIT University a BIT is offered as a three-year program, giving the student the choice of a majors These major are: Application Programming, Business Applications, Multimedia Design, Network Programming, System Administration and Web Systems\n\nThe state of the BIT program in Australia is unstable, as many universities offer it as a technical program while others as a business, e-commerce related program. The Australian Computer Society recognizes all BIT degrees, however Engineers Australia only recognises BIT degrees that are technical.\n\nIn Bangladesh, University of Dhaka and Jahangirnagar University, University of Information Technology and Science (UITS) offer 4 years bachelor degree in Information Technology.\n\nIn Canada, Carleton University and Algonquin College have jointly created four programs under the Bachelor of Information Technology degree: Information Resource Management, Interactive Multimedia and Design, Network Technology, and Optical Systems and Sensors. University of Ontario Institute of Technology also offers streams in Networking & Information Technology Security, and Game Development and Entrepreneurship.\n\nIn India, the Bachelor of Information Technology is a 4-year degree course. The course is divided into eight semesters, and the degree is awarded after completion of a four-year program. The degree is conferred by government and private institutions, as well as a host of other prestigious institutes (both public and privately funded) for their professional engineering programs. However, most other institutions in India use the Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.)/Bachelor of Engineering (BE) in IT degrees. Admission to the program is done through a nationwide entrance test.\nThere is also a three-year course which awards a B.Sc degree at the end of the program. Some universities even offer a B.Sc IT course either through regular programs or through distance-learning courses.\nHowever, there is not much as demand for the B.Sc. course as there is for the B.Tech or BE IT courses.\nThere are some top colleges in India for IT degree like PES Modern COE IT Dept., IIT's, ZEAL COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, NIT's, Vjti, VIT Vellore,RMD engineering college and Coep.\n\nIn the Iran Bachelor of Information Technology degrees are awarded after four years of study and the completion of a thesis with a specialization in a certain field such as e-learning, computer networks, information security, data mining, software development, e-commerce\n\nIn Iran, Sharif University of Technology, Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic) and University of Tehran are specified universities holding this course in Bsc and Msc.\n\nAlso, Tehran Virtual University and Noure-Touba Virtual University are virtual learning where hold IT course in Iran.\n\nIn Iran, Students whom graduated from this course has been passed subjects about Data Structures, Algorithm Design, Computer Networking, Artificial Intelligence, Database Concepts, Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, Software Engineering, Management Theories, Engineering Economics and...\n\nThe Polytechnic of Namibia offers a 3-year degree in IT in three areas of specialization: Business Computing, system administration and networks & software development\n\nIn the Netherlands Bachelor of Information and Communication Technology degrees are awarded after four years of study and the completion of a thesis with a specialization in a certain field such as Informatics, Computer Engineering, Information Science or Software Engineering.\n\nThe formal title awarded to a student after successfully defending his thesis before an examination committee is ingenieur (abbr. ing.) and B.ICT, the former being the Dutch equivalent of a Bachelor of Engineering degree.\n\nIn Puerto Rico several universities offer Bachelor of Information Technology degrees with specializations in Networking, Security, and/or Programming; typically awarded after four years of full-time study and the completion of a supervised project or internship. Universities in Puerto Rico offering this specialized education via in-person and online modalities include Columbia Central University, EDP University of Puerto Rico, and National University College.\n\nIn South Africa the University of Pretoria offers the Baccalaureus in Information Technology (BIT) degree as a four-year undergraduate programme. The University of Pretoria is also the first university in South Africa to offer this degree. Upon successful completion of a BIT degree a student can continue with either a part-time or full-time MIT programme at the University of Pretoria to round off his or her professional training or enter the workforce.\nThe BIT course includes, but is not limited to, the following subjects: Business Management, Economics, Statistics, Mathematics, English, Programming and Advanced Programming, Systems Development, Philosophy, Financial Accounting, Data Structures and Algorithms, Operating Systems, Databases, Networks, Artificial Intelligence, Information Organization and Retrieval, Computer Architecture, Software Engineering, Multimedia.\nAs an alternative to BIT, the University of Pretoria's Computer Science Department offers two three-year degrees, BSc CS and BSc IT.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, Bachelor of Information Technology (BIT) is 3 year undergraduate degree without any specialization, mostly awarded as an external degree.\n\nThe University of Colombo School of Computing (UCSC) and the Faculty of Information Technology of the University of Moratuwa offers the three year external degree programmes leading to Bachelor of Information Technology (External).

Casey, Sr. and his successor, Tom Ridge, due to the dedication and support of State Representative Kevin Blaum, and built on land given by the Greater Wilkes-Barre Chamber, the arena was originally named the Northeastern Pennsylvania Civic Arena and Convention Center. In 2000, the naming rights were sold to First Union Bank, becoming First Union Arena, until the summer of 2003, when First Union Bank merged into Wachovia, at which point it became Wachovia Arena at Casey Plaza. On January 20, 2010, the arena became Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza, as part of a 10-year naming rights contract with the Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs racetrack and casino.\n\nIt has been home to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, of the AHL since 1999, and the former home of the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Pioneers, of the AF2 League. In January 2012 it was planned to be the home to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Shamrocks of the North American Lacrosse League, but the league had folded.\n\nThe Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza has been recognized by many entertainment magazines as one of the best in the country for arenas under 10,000 in capacity, especially for its attendance and ease of show setup and teardown. The Penguins hold the American Hockey League record for most sellouts in a season, selling out all 40 home games in 2002–2003 and 2003–2004, and ran a streak of 90 consecutive sellouts between March 2002 and October 2004, and 54 from December 2000 to February 2002.\n\nOther than Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins hockey games, other events that occur at the arena include circus performances, an annual Christmas-time Trans-Siberian Orchestra performance, professional ice-skating shows, Harlem Globetrotters, and the annual graduation ceremonies for nearby Crestwood High School, Penn Foster High School, King's College, University of Scranton, Luzerne County Community College, and Marywood University.\n\nThe arena has regularly hosted professional wrestling since 2000.

Released in Japan on 19 March 2003 and in Europe from 24 March by Stockholm Records, it was their first studio album since the release of \"Gran Turismo\" in 1998, during which time band members released numerous solo works under assumed aliases: Peter Svensson issued Paus' sole, self-titled album in 1998. This was followed by the release of the self-titled record from Nina Persson's A Camp in 2001, and bassist Magnus Sveningsson's \"I Sing Because of You\" (under the Righteous Boy moniker) in 2002.\n\nThe album differs from much of the band's earlier work, eschewing the pop and electronic rock sound of previous material in favour of a sparser, alternative rock and country-influenced production. Its lyrical themes are also more mature, with subject matter inspired by domestic abuse, depression, love and fatalism. It received generally positive reviews from music critics upon release, with several reviewers commending it as the band's best album, while praising their compositional work and the change in musical direction. The record was released in the United States on 25 May 2004, and several US publications criticised the band for abandoning their old pop sound, and accused them of being ashamed of their former \"happy\" pop sound.\n\nThe band won three awards at the 2003 Grammis—the Swedish equivalent of the Grammy Awards. \"Long Gone Before Daylight\" won the \"Album of the Year\" award while the Cardigans won \"Rock Group of the Year\".

{"id": "1886914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1886914", "title": "Mankind Quarterly", "text": "Mankind Quarterly\n\nMankind Quarterly is a peer-reviewed academic journal that has been described as a \"cornerstone of the scientific racism establishment\", a \"white supremacist journal\", an \"infamous racist journal\", and \"scientific racism's keepers of the flame\". It covers physical and cultural anthropology, including human evolution, intelligence, ethnography, linguistics, mythology, and archaeology. It is published by the Ulster Institute for Social Research, which is presided over by Richard Lynn.\n\nThe journal was established in 1960 with funding from segregationists, who designed it to serve as a mouthpiece for their views. The costs of initially launching the journal were paid by the Pioneer Fund's Wickliffe Draper. The founders were Robert Gayre, Henry Garrett, Roger Pearson, Corrado Gini, Luigi Gedda (Honorary Advisory Board), Otmar von Verschuer and Reginald Ruggles Gates. Another early editor was Herbert Charles Sanborn, formerly the chair of the department of Philosophy and Psychology at Vanderbilt University from 1921 to 1942. It was originally published in Edinburgh, Scotland, by the International Association for the Advancement of Ethnology and Eugenics, an organization founded by Draper to promote eugenics and scientific racism.\n\nIts foundation may in part have been a response to the declaration by UNESCO, which dismissed the validity of race as a biological concept, and to increasing attempts to ban racial segregation in the American South.\n\nIn 1961 physical anthropologist Juan Comas published a series of scathing critiques of the journal arguing that the journal was reproducing discredited racial ideologies, such as Nordicism and anti-Semitism, under the guise of science. In 1963, after the journal's first issue, contributors U. R. Ehrenfels, T. N. Madan, and Juan Comas said that the journal's editorial practice was biased and misleading. In response, the journal published a series of rebuttals and attacks on Comas. Comas argued in \"Current Anthropology\" that the journal's publication of A. James Gregor's review of Comas' book \"Racial Myths\" was politically motivated. Comas claimed the journal misrepresented the field of physical anthropology by adhering to outdated racial ideologies, for example by claiming that Jews were considered a \"biological race\" by the racial biologists of the time. Other anthropologists complained that paragraphs that did not agree with the racial ideology of the editorial board were deleted from published articles without the authors' agreement.\n\nFew academic anthropologists would publish in the journal or serve on its board; when Gates died, Carleton S. Coon, an anthropologist sympathetic to the hereditarian and racialist view of the journal, was asked to replace him, but he rejected the offer stating that \"I fear that for a professional anthropologist to accept membership on your board would be the kiss of death\". The journal continued to be published supported by grant money. Publisher Roger Pearson received over a million dollars in grants from the Pioneer Fund in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nDuring the \"\"Bell Curve\" wars\" of the 1990s, the journal received attention when opponents of \"The Bell Curve\" publicised the fact that some of the works cited by \"Bell Curve\" authors Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray had first been published in \"Mankind Quarterly\". In \"The New York Review of Books\", Charles Lane referred to \"The Bell Curve\"s \"tainted sources\", that seventeen researchers cited in the book's bibliography had contributed articles to, and ten of these seventeen had also been editors of, \"Mankind Quarterly\", \"a notorious journal of 'racial history' founded, and funded, by men who believe in the genetic superiority of the white race.\"\n\nThe journal has been published by the Ulster Institute for Social Research since January 2015, when publication duties were transferred from Pearson's Council for Social and Economic Studies (which had published the journal since 1979).\n\nThe editor-in-chief is Richard Lynn. Previous editors include Roger Pearson, Gerhard Meisenberg and Edward Dutton.\n\nMany of those involved with the journal are connected to academic hereditarianism. The journal has been criticised as being political and strongly right-leaning, supporting eugenics, racist or fascist.\n\nThe journal is abstracted and indexed in:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1886921", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1886921", "title": "Norfolk Scope", "text": "Norfolk Scope\n\nNorfolk Scope is a multi-function complex in Norfolk, Virginia, comprising an 11,000-person arena, a 2,500-person theater known as Chrysler Hall, a 10,000 square foot-exhibition hall and a 600-car parking garage.\n\nThe arena was designed by Italian architect/engineer Pier Luigi Nervi in conjunction with the (now defunct) local firm Williams and Tazewell, which designed the entire complex. Nervi's design for the arena's reinforced concrete dome derived from the PalaLottomatica and the much smaller Palazzetto dello Sport, which were built in the 1950s for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.\n\nConstruction on Scope began in June 1968 at the northern perimeter of Norfolk's downtown and was completed in 1971 at a cost of $35 million. Federal funds covered $23 million of the cost, and when it opened formally on November 12, 1971, the structure was the second-largest public complex in Virginia, behind only The Pentagon.\n\nFeaturing the world's largest reinforced thinshell concrete dome\n(though eclipsed by the Seattle Seattle Kingdome from 1976 to 2000), Scope won the Virginia Society of the American Institute of Architects \"Test of Time\" award in 2003. Wes Lewis, director of Old Dominion University's civil engineering technology program, called it \"a beautiful marrying of art and engineering.\" Noted architectural critic James Howard Kunstler described the design as looking like \"yesterday's tomorrow.\"\n\nThe name \"Scope\", a contraction of \"kaleidoscope\", emphasizes the venue's re-configurability. The facility logo (right), which features a multi-colored, abstracted kaleidoscope image, was designed by Raymond Loewy's firm \"Loewy/Snaith\" of New York.\n\nAfter watching the 1960 Rome Summer Olympics on television, and seeing the Palazzo dello Sport and Palazzetto dello Sport, Brad Tazewell and Jim Williams, two Norfolk architects, solicited U.S. Sen. A. Willis Robertson, father of Pat Robertson, to build a sports complex in Norfolk. Subsequently, President Lyndon B. Johnson asked Robertson to support federal funding for a multimillion-dollar cultural center in Colorado and Robertson said he would if Johnson would support one in Norfolk. Williams and Tazewell was subsequently commissioned; they in turn commissioned Nervi.\n\nThe complex was an important part of the first phase of Norfolk's post-World War II revitalization. A large section of the city's downtown was razed, and the Scope complex was to \"anchor\" its northern corner, with the Vincent Kling designed Courthouse and Civic complex anchoring the Eastern edge of downtown.\n\nThe arena is located on its 14-acre site above a raised plinth, below which is located a parking garage for 640 cars. The facility includes a exhibit hall as well as the adjacent Chrysler Hall, a music and theater venue, home to the Virginia Symphony Orchestra. The arena's seating can be reconfigured to accommodate from 10,253 for sporting events up to 13,800 for concerts.\n\nWith a concrete monolithic dome measuring 440 ft (134 m) in diameter and a height of 110 ft (33.5 m), the dome was, at the time of its construction, the largest of its kind in the world — and was displaced as the record holder after the construction of the Seattle Kingdome. After the demolition of the larger Kingdome in 2000, Scope reclaimed the title as having the world's largest reinforced thin-shell concrete dome. Supported by 24 flying buttresses, the arena roof encloses . With over 1,000 pilings, the facility was constructed 10' below the city's water table. The roof is a ribbed concrete dome, independent of seating bowl formed of sloped concrete beams supporting precast treads and risers which form the seating bowl. The perimeter of the dome roof is supported by a combination of vertical columns and inclined buttresses, which tie into a tension ring below ground. A concentric ring, approximately 7' 9\" wide, is suspended from the dome, for service and lighting needs.\n\nDuring preparations for the first hosting of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, a bear escaped its cage and ran across the wet paint on the floor of the unfinished Exhibition Hall below. During the first presentation in the Exhibition Hall of the Hampton Roads Automobile Show, visitors could spot bear tracks in the painted floor, between the exhibitions. (Source: \"The Virginian-Pilot\")\n\nThe arena has undergone $11 million of renovations since 2003, including the replacement of a center-hung scoreboard with a matrix screen on each side with a center-hung scoreboard with LED video and matrix boards and two LED end-zone videoboards in 2008. A new glass wall has been installed, and is expected to be extended in order to expand the arena's main concourse at a cost of $3.5 million in 2014. This would result in additional restrooms and concession stands at the arena.\n\nThere has been discussion about expanding the Norfolk Scope, by adding 5,000 seats and 24 luxury suites, in the near future, in order to remain competitive with neighboring venues in the southeastern and mid-Atlantic states. In 2018, the city decided to move on from the renovation concept, which would total $200 million. In his 2019 State of the City address, Norfolk mayor Kenny Alexander announced plans to study the possibility of building a new arena, in a not yet named location.\n\nNational Wrestling Alliance, Jim Crockett Promotions, World Championship Wrestling, World Wrestling Entertainment had wrestling show in Scope many times from 1960s with many times Pay Per View event. Biggest event had Starrcade 88 on December,1988.\n\n"}

Built in 1977, at a cost of US$8 million, it is the home arena for the Maine Mariners of the ECHL. There are 6,206 permanent seats in the arena, and it seats up to 9,500 for concerts.\n\nThe inside consists of one deck rising 24 rows, 14 seats across at its widest, and 30 separated sections around. The arena floor features of space, making it useful for trade shows and conventions in addition to sports and concerts. The arena has locals sponsor individual seats at the arena. Those who pay to sponsor seats at the Cross Insurance Arena can have their name engraved on their seats or dedicate the seat to someone they know. The arena's official name is the George I. Lewis Auditorium at Cross Insurance Arena. The press box is named for local sportscaster Frank Fixaris.\n\nZZ Top was the very first headline act to play the arena when it opened on March 3, 1977.\n\nElvis Presley was to have flown from Memphis to Portland on August 16, 1977, for a performance at the arena the following day, but he was found dead at his Graceland mansion that morning. A re-enactment of the preparations for the Portland show is featured in the bio film \"This Is Elvis\".\n\nThe venue hosted the America East Conference (then the ECAC North) men's basketball tournament in 1980. Two AHL hockey clubs that have called the arena home, include the Portland Pirates and three time Calder Cup champions, the Maine Mariners.\n\nOn December 4, 2009, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) held their first house show in Maine at the Cumberland Civic Center.\n\nThe United States Lacrosse League announced that the Maine Moose Trax would play its home games at the Cross Insurance Arena when the league was to begin play in the fall of 2014, though arena trustees called the announcement premature and stated no final agreement had been reached. It was the first franchise announced for the league, but the league never played any matches.\n\nArena trustees reached a 10-year agreement in June 2014 with Cross Insurance Agency for the sale of the facility's naming rights for $2.5 million. The facility was renamed Cross Insurance Arena despite the fact that Cross Insurance also holds the naming rights to Bangor's Cross Insurance Center, away. Both parties to the deal state that there should be no confusion between the two facilities. The deal was also signed despite the naming rights of one of the entrances being named for the Clark Insurance company, though Clark Insurance stated their deal would remain.\n\nThe arena is also the alternate home ice of the Maine Black Bears men's ice hockey team, who normally play at Alfond Arena in Orono, Maine.\n\nIn October 2010, a task force voted to fund renovations costing $27 to $29 million. The renovations will include addition of premium seating, as well as upgrades to the locker rooms, an increased number of restrooms, and other improvements. The renovations would add just over 34,000 square feet to the building. It required approval by both the then-civic center board and approval of a bond issue by county voters.\n\nThe bond was approved by county voters in November 2011. Renovations began after the 2011–12 hockey season. Following completion of the Portland Pirates' 2012–13 season, the arena closed for a second renovation phase, and is scheduled to reopen in January, 2014. The Pirates intended to play the first portion of their 2013–14 season at the Androscoggin Bank Colisée, through at least December 31. All renovations were completed by February 2014, and the first event in the facility was scheduled to be the Maine Home, Remodeling and Garden Show on Saturday, February 15.\n\nCivic Center trustees in 2013 ceased negotiations with the Pirates over terms of a new lease, and further stated they would seek new tenants for the calendar slots originally given to the Pirates. The Pirates announced on September 26, 2013 that the entire 2013–2014 home schedule would be played at the Androscoggin Bank Colisée in Lewiston over the dispute, instead of the, already scheduled, first 13 games. The dispute was primarily over share of food and beverage sales the Pirates would receive, though other issues existed. The Pirates are not able to share revenues of alcohol, due to not being the property's owner. Therefore, management asked for a larger percentage of food revenues. Civic Center trustees stated that they only break even on the presence of the Pirates in the building, and that their expenses would actually be less without them. The Chairman of the Board of Trustees further criticized the Pirates for demanding more of a \"subsidy\" for themselves and stated their desired lease agreement would cost county taxpayers money. The Pirates also stated they would continue a lawsuit against the arena with the hopes of playing there in the future.\n\nNew Pirates majority owner Ron Cain announced on December 19, 2013, that the team dropped its lawsuit and that arena trustees would resume negotiations, both seeking \"to strike a balance between the team's business needs and the arena's financial obligations\" according to Cain. The chairman of the trustees stated that he found Cain's comments on the issue \"constructive\" and he thus was willing to restart talks.\n\nMaine Senate President Justin Alfond, who is from Portland, announced that he submitted emergency legislation to the Maine Legislature to allow the Pirates to receive a share of alcohol revenue, as the original agreement called for but was ruled to be illegal. Cain said that Alfond's efforts did not play a role in their decision on the lawsuit, but could help the team going forward.\n\nOn February 4, 2014, arena trustees and the Pirates announced that a 5-year lease agreement had been reached and that the team would return to the not yet renamed Civic Center for the 2014–15 season. The agreement includes the sharing of concessions revenue the Pirates sought, which may or may not include alcohol sales pending passage of Sen. Alfond's bill.\n\nHowever, on May 4, 2016, it was announced that the Portland Pirates had signed a letter of intent to sell the franchise and would relocate the team to Springfield, Massachusetts. Less than a week after the announcement, a team of investors headed by former Pirates executives W. Godfrey Wood and Brad Church announced their intentions to put an ECHL team in Portland to fill the void, possibly joining as early as 2017. It would take an extra year, but Comcast Spectacor, the arena owners, purchased the franchise rights of the Alaska Aces and relocated the team to Portland for the 2018–19 season as a new version of the Maine Mariners.\n\n\n"}

Maines Veterans Memorial Arena (formerly known as the Broome County Veterans Memorial Arena) is a 6,925-seat multi-purpose arena located in Binghamton, New York. The arena was completed in 1973, providing an entertainment venue for residents of the Greater Binghamton area. The arena contains eight luxury suites, each holding 25 fans (200 total). A longtime home to minor league hockey, the arena is currently home to the Binghamton Devils of the American Hockey League.\n\nIn the 1960s, the city of Binghamton started planning a number of urban renewal projects to revitalize the urban core, collectively known as Project 1. Based on the recommendations of a citizen committee, city and county leaders included a proposal as part of Project 1 to construct a downtown cultural complex. The proposed complex would consist of two buildings: a multipurpose veterans memorial auditorium and a performing arts center. A nationwide design competition for the complex (at the time referred to as the Broome County Cultural Center) was held, with Elbasani, Logan & Severin (ELS) being selected as the winners in November 1967. ELS was formed specifically to enter in the competition, and has since gone on to become a nationally-recognized architectural firm. The winning design placed the arena between State Street and Washington Street, and the performing arts center along the river on Washington Street, with an elevated walkway over Washington Street connecting the two buildings. The arena plans made use of an innovative space frame based design to avoid view-obstructing columns.\n\nThe first (and ultimately only) phase of construction, consisting of the arena and a short portion of the elevated walkway, lasted from 1971 to 1973, with the total cost coming to $7.5 million at the time (equivalent to $ million in ). The arena was built with 17,000 square feet of space on the arena floor, with an additional 12,000 square feet on the concourse. The first act, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, took place in an unfinished arena in May 1973. Chicago played the first concert at the arena (with Bruce Springsteen as opener) on June 13, 1973. The ribbon cutting and first event on ice was with the Ice Capades. The proposed second phase of the complex, consisting of the remaining elevated walkway and the riverside performing arts center, was never built due to budgetary issues; the portion of the walkway built during the first phase remains as an extension of the arena. In place of the new performing arts center, the county refurbished and expanded the Capri Theatre, which became the Broome County Forum.\n\nThe Broome Dusters of the North American Hockey League were the building's first full-time tenant. After a tepid first year of support, the Dusters grew greatly in popularity, and were able to draw many sellouts, and the community passion for the team led the \"Hockey News\" to declare Binghamton as Hockey Town USA. The Broome Dusters became the Binghamton Dusters in 1977 and moved into the American Hockey League. That AHL franchise would go through a number of name changes, becoming the Whalers and Rangers before relocating to Hartford, Connecticut in 1997. The Rangers were replaced by the BC Icemen, of the United Hockey League, for five seasons. The AHL returned in 2002 with the Binghamton Senators, who were affiliated with the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League.

It runs between the two English university cities of Oxford and Cambridge via Milton Keynes and other settlements in Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire, at the northern rim of the London commuter belt. It is significant only in economic geography, with little physical geography in common.\n\nThe original Oxford to Cambridge (O2C) Arc initiative was launched in 2003 by three English regional development agencies (RDAs), EEDA, EMDA and SEEDA. The aim of the initiative is to promote and accelerate the development of the unique set of educational, research and business assets and activities that characterise the area and in doing so, create an “arc” of innovation and entrepreneurial activity that would, in time, be ‘best in the field'.\n\nIn November 2017, a report for the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC) noted that \"in 2014, the Gross Value Added (GVA) of the \"corridor\" was £90.5bn (2011 prices); by doubling housebuilding rates in the area, and delivering East West Rail and the Oxford-Cambridge Expressway, this [would] increase by £163bn to a GVA of £250bn\".\n\nThe Arc is a major centre of the UK's high tech manufacturing and research industries. It is serviced by four international airports (Stansted, Luton, Heathrow and Birmingham), all located just outside the Arc itself. Cranfield Airport and Cambridge Airport take executive jets. Cambridge Airport is an important centre for aircraft maintenance.\n\nOther major industries include agriculture, tourism, construction, entertainment, education, retail and finance. A high proportion of the population commutes daily to London. Commuting and business travel within the arc is relatively difficult in the absence of important east–west infrastructure.\n\nThe National Infrastructure Commission projects that the Arc will become host to major hi-tech industrial developments and will be the site to one million new homes by 2050, with Milton Keynes alone doubling in population to 500,000.\n\nTo facilitate this development (and wider national infrastructure needs for outer orbital routes around London), two major projects are underway or planned. Work has begun to extend East West Rail from Bicester to the West Coast Main Line at (Milton Keynes); onward extension to Cambridge is planned. Concurrently, detailed route options planning has begun on the Oxford-Milton Keynes phase that is to complete the Oxford-Cambridge Expressway (linking the A34 with the A14).\n\nThe Arc has a major university sector with 20,000 workers as part of the knowledge economy: Oxford University, Oxford Brookes University, Buckingham University, The Open University (HQ Milton Keynes), Cranfield University, University of Bedfordshire, the University of Cambridge, and the Anglia Ruskin University at Cambridge.\n\nThe Arc is one of the most ethnically diverse regions of the UK. Bedford, roughly central to the Arc and with a population of 100,000, is home to native speakers of over 100 languages, a figure which rivals London, Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. The Arc has the fastest growing population of any of the similar regions within the UK; several of the major towns, most notably Bicester and Milton Keynes, are set to double in size over the coming few decades, and others, such as Cambourne, have been built from scratch since the late 1990s. \n\nPolitically, the Arc is largely a Conservative stronghold, with only the urban constituencies returning Liberal Democrat or Labour MPs.\n\nThe region is well served by major radial routes from London (the M40, M1, A1(M) and M11 motorways, and the West Coast Main Line, the Midland Main Line and the East Coast Main Line railways). However, routes around the arc are poor, with a disjointed and overloaded road network (A428, A421/A422 and A43) and a fragmentary railway line (remnants of the former Varsity Line).\n\nA twice-hourly express bus service, route X5, is operated by Stagecoach UK Buses between Cambridge and Oxford, serving the more important of the settlements below en route but taking 3 hours and 40 minutes to travel the .\n\nIn November 2017, in its report on the Arc, the NIC called for the railway line between Bicester and Bletchley to be reopened by 2023 and Bedford/Cambridge by 2030, and for the development and construction of a new grade separated dual carriageway between the M1 and Oxford by 2030, as part of the proposed Oxford-Cambridge Expressway.\n\n\n\n\n‡ Places served by X5 route.<br>\n† Places planned to be served by East West Rail. , plans for Sandy/Tempsford/St Neots services via EWR have not beed detailed.<br>\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Places planned to be served by the Oxford Cambridge Expressway. , the route (if any) of the Expressway west of the M1 is undecided.

The major organization on base is known as DLA Land and Maritime. Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) is also a major tenant on base. The base has been affected several times by the United States Base Realignment and Closure program. It is located in the Columbus, Ohio suburb of Whitehall. The DSCC has a historical marker. The base was opened in 1918.\n\nDSCC has served in every major military engagement since World War I. In 1917, the site was a combination of swamp land and farmland. America's production effort in World War I reached a climax in 1918, when transportation lines to ports of embarkation for men and materials were filled to capacity. This site was advantageous because it afforded immediate access to three important railroad lines. The U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps made the first purchase of land, , to construct a government military installation in April, 1918. Warehouse construction began in May of that year, and by August, six warehouses were receiving material for storage. Those warehouses are still in use today.\n\nThe lull between World War I and World War II reduced center operations to mostly reconditioning and sale of the stockpiles which had been needed earlier to ensure the nations defense.\n\nDuring World War II the center became the largest military supply installation in the world. In December 1942, an additional were purchased. With more than 10,000 civilian employees, it played a large part in the overall war effort. Some of the warehouses were turned into secured barracks to house prisoners of war.\n\nAmidst the wars, the conflicts and humanitarian relief efforts, the installation has continuously worked to establish direct and fast moving supply lines to support American armed forces in all parts of the world.\n\nThe installation's operational activities were assigned to the U.S. Army Supply and Maintenance Command in July 1962. The following year, it became the Defense Construction Supply Center under what is now known as the Defense Logistics Agency.\n\nDSCC was formed from the 1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission which ordered merger of the former:\nDecisions made during BRAC 95 further refined the transition toward total weapons systems management.\n\nDSCC was renamed and reorganized in January 1996.\n\n"}

Some time later, the scene gained more publicity with the rise of a publicly feuding pair of crew leaders, Stezo of the Flotte Imperiale and Almighty of the Ministère Authentik. There is a kind of gangsta rap-influenced Ivorian hip hop called \"rap dogba\", inspired by Angelo & les Dogbas.\n\nOverall, hip hop is still perceived in Ivory Coast as a foreign type of music and artists do not enjoy the popularity of their zouglou or Coupé-Décalé counterparts. It is considered a marginal movement with a specific following because most Ivorians did not find material or situations to relate to or connect with in Ivorian hip-hop. However, since 2006 and the rise of a new school of Ivorian rap crews such as the very popular Garba 50 (whose name is inspired by a very cheap and popular Ivorian dish eaten by the common people), hip hop is enjoying a newfound following among the Ivorian population. By blending Nouchi, the particular and very evocative Ivorian vernacular and street language, with hip hop beats and rhyming style, groups like Garba 50, Sans Soi, and Rage Man (among others) have managed to revitalize the movement and make it more accessible to Ivorians.\n\nA new generation of Ivorian rappers who live overseas in France or the U.S like Djafoul Koncept, Dynamik Boobah Siddik, DDF, and many others have added to the growth of the movement in Ivory Coast by keeping in close touch with their Ivorian fan base and pushing technological and musical changes back to their native land.\n\n\n"}

For example, the myths of Adonis and Osiris share several elements, leading some scholars to conclude that they share a source, i.e. images passed down in cultures or from one to another, being ascribed new interpretations of the action depicted, as well as new names in various readings of icons.\n\nClaude Lévi-Strauss (1908–2009), who gave the term wide circulation, wrote, \"If one wants to establish a parallel between structural linguistics and the structural analysis of myths, the correspondence is established, not between mytheme and word but between mytheme and phoneme.\"\n\nThe structuralist analyzer of folk tales, Vladimir Propp, treated the individual tale as the unit of analysis. The unitary mytheme, by contrast, is the equivalent in myth of the phonemes, morphemes, and sememes into which structural linguistics divides language, the smallest possible units of sound, structure, and meaning (respectively) within a language system.\n\nIn the 1950s Claude Lévi-Strauss first adapted this technique of language analysis to analytic myth criticism. In his work on the myth systems of primitive tribes, working from the analogy of language structure, he adopted the French term \"mythème\", with the assertion that the system of meaning within mythic utterances parallels closely that of a language system. Roman Jakobson varies this idea, treating mythemes as concepts or phonemes which have no significance in themselves but whose significance might be shown by sociological analysis.\n\nPhilosophers such as Daniel Dennett have also used the term \"mytheme\".\n\nLev Manovich uses the terms \"seme\" and \"mytheme\" in his book, \"The Language of New Media\", to describe aspects of culture that computer images enter into dialog with.\n\n"}

{"id": "1886978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1886978", "title": "Battle of Pulo Aura", "text": "Battle of Pulo Aura\n\nThe Battle of Pulo Aura was a minor naval engagement of the Napoleonic Wars, fought on 14 February 1804, in which a large convoy of Honourable East India Company (HEIC) East Indiamen, well-armed merchant ships, intimidated, drove off and chased away a powerful French naval squadron. Although the French force was much stronger than the British convoy, Commodore Nathaniel Dance's aggressive tactics persuaded Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois to retire after only a brief exchange of shot. Dance then chased the French warships until his convoy was out of danger, whereupon he resumed his passage toward British India. Linois later claimed that the unescorted British merchant fleet was defended by eight ships of the line, a claim criticised by contemporary officers and later historians.\n\nThe battle occurred during an extended commerce raiding operation by a French squadron led by Linois in the ship of the line \"Marengo\". Linois had sailed to the Indian Ocean in 1803 before the declaration of war, under orders to install garrisons in the French and Dutch colonies in the region and to prey on lightly defended British merchant shipping. One of the richest and most significant targets was the \"China Fleet\", an annual convoy of East Indiamen from China and other Far Eastern ports that carried millions of pounds worth of trade goods. Although these large vessels were accompanied by numerous smaller merchant ships, news of the outbreak of war had only just arrived in the Pacific and the only warship available to defend the fleet was the small HEIC armed brig \"Ganges\". Dutch informants notified Linois of the fleet's destination and date of departure from Canton while he was anchored at Batavia on Java, and he sailed in search of the convoy on 28 December 1803, eventually discovering it in early February.\n\nAlthough no warships protected the convoy, Commodore Dance knew that lookouts could, from a distance, mistake a large East Indiaman for a ship of the line. He raised flags that indicated his fleet included part of the Royal Navy squadron operating in the Indian Ocean at the time and formed into a line of battle. Although Linois's ships were clearly superior, the British reaction unnerved him and he quickly broke off combat. Dance continued his ruse, pursuing Linois for two hours until the body of the convoy was safe. King George III knighted Dance for his courage and various mercantile and patriotic organisations awarded him large sums of money, while both the Emperor Napoleon and Linois's own officers personally castigated the French admiral for his failure to press the attack against a weaker and extremely valuable enemy. Although he remained in command of the squadron for another two years and had some minor success against undefended merchant ships, he suffered a string of defeats and inconclusive engagements against weaker British naval forces. Ironically, Linois was captured at the Action of 13 March 1806 by a numerically superior British battle squadron which he had mistaken for a merchant convoy.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, the British economy depended on its ability to trade with the British Empire, particularly the valuable colonies in British India. The intercontinental trade was conducted by the governors of India, the Honourable East India Company (HEIC), using their fleet of large, well-armed merchant vessels known as East Indiamen. These ships were of between 500 and 1200 nominal tons burthen (bm) and could carry up to 36 guns for defence against pirates, privateers and small warships. They were not, however, capable under normal circumstances of fighting off an enemy frigate or ship of the line. Their guns were usually of inferior design, and their crew smaller and less well trained than those on a naval ship. The East Indiamen sought to ensure the safety of their cargo and passengers, not defeat enemy warships in battle. Despite these disadvantages, the size of East Indiamen meant that from a distance they appeared quite similar to a small ship of the line, a deception usually augmented by paintwork and dummy cannon. At the Bali Strait Incident of 28 January 1797 an unescorted convoy of East Indiamen had used this similarity to intimidate a powerful French frigate squadron into withdrawing without a fight. In February 1799 an attack by a combined French-Spanish squadron on the assembled convoy at Macau was driven off in the Macau Incident without combat by the small Royal Navy escort squadron.\n\nThe East Indiamen would gather at ports in India and the Far East and from there set out for Britain in large convoys, often carrying millions of pounds worth of trade goods. The journey would usually take six months and the ships would subsequently return carrying troops and passengers to augment the British forces stationed in India. \"Country ships\", smaller merchant vessels chartered for local trade, sometimes independently from the HEIC, would often join the convoys. To protect their ships from the depredations of pirates, the HEIC also operated its own private navy of small armed vessels. In combination, these ships were an effective deterrent against smaller raiders, but were no match for a professional warship.\n\nUnderstanding the importance of the Indian Ocean trade and seeking to threaten it from the start of the inevitable war, First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte ordered a squadron to sail for India in March 1803. This force was under the command of Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois and consisted of the ship of the line \"Marengo\" and three frigates. Linois operated from the island base of Île de France with orders to attack British shipping once war had begun. Sailing initially to Pondicherry in India, Linois had a close encounter with a British squadron under Rear-Admiral Peter Rainier during July, but was at Île de France in August when news arrived that the Napoleonic Wars had started on 16 May. Determined to fortify the French raiding bases in the region, Linois landed troops and supplies at Réunion and Batavia. During the operation he despatched the frigate to Muscat, captured numerous individual country ships, and burned the British trading post of Bencoolen. On 10 December he anchored at Batavia for the winter. Shortly thereafter, informants passed to Batavia the composition and date of departure of the British \"China Fleet\", leading Linois to set out to intercept it. On 28 December, Linois's squadron—consisting of \"Marengo\", frigates and , the corvette and the Dutch brig —departed Batavia. The ships carried six months worth of provisions as Linois had anticipated an extended patrol in the approaches to the Strait of Malacca in the South China Sea.\n\nThe China Fleet was a large annual British merchant convoy that gathered at Canton in the Pearl River during the winter before sailing for Britain, via India. As the convoy passed through the East Indies, it was joined by vessels sailing from other European ports in the region on the route to India, until it often numbered dozens of ships. The 1804 fleet departed in late January, and by the time it reached the approaches to the Strait of Malacca it had swelled to include 16 East Indiamen, 11 country ships, a Portuguese merchant ship from Macau and a vessel from Botany Bay in New South Wales. Although the HEIC had provided the small, armed brig \"Ganges\" as an escort, this vessel could only dissuade pirates; it could not hope to compete with a French warship. There was no military escort: news of the outbreak of war had reached Canton before reinforcements had arrived from the squadron in India. Spies based in Canton had passed the composition and date of departure of the China Fleet to Linois in Batavia, but the Dutch informants at Canton had also passed on false reports that Royal Navy warships were accompanying the convoy, reports that may have been deliberately placed by British authorities. The convoy was an immensely valuable prize, its cargo of tea, silk and porcelain valued at over £8 million in contemporary values (the equivalent of £ as of 2020). Also on board were 80 Chinese plants ordered by Sir Joseph Banks for the royal gardens and carried in a specially designed plant room. The HEIC Select Committee in Canton had been very concerned for the safety of the unescorted convoy, and had debated delaying its departure. The various captains had been consulted, including Henry Meriton, who in his ship had captured a frigate during the Action of 4 August 1800, a disastrous French attack on a convoy of East Indiamen off Brazil. Meriton advised that the convoy was powerful enough in both appearance and reality to dissuade any attack. John Farquharson, captain of , opposed Meriton, arguing that the crews of East Indiamen were so badly trained they would be unable to mutually defend one another if faced with a determined enemy. Eventually the Committee decided it could delay the convoy no longer and awarded command to the most experienced captain, Commodore Nathaniel Dance—an officer with over 45 years service at sea—in the East Indiaman \"Earl Camden\".\n\nAt 08:00 on 14 February 1804, with the island of Pulo Aura within sight to the south-west near the eastern entrance to the Straits of Malacca, the Indiaman \"Royal George\" raised a signal describing three sail approaching the convoy from the direction of the island. This was Linois's squadron, which had been cruising in the area for the previous month in anticipation of the convoy's arrival. Dance ordered the brig \"Ganges\" and the Indiamen \"Alfred\", \"Royal George\", , and \"Hope\" to approach the strange vessels and investigate, rapidly discovering they were enemy warships. By 13:00, Dance had readied his guns and reformed his convoy, with the large Indiamen formed up in line of battle to receive the French attack as if they were warships. During the late afternoon, Linois's squadron fell in behind the slow line of merchant ships and Dance expected an immediate attack, but Linois was cautious and merely observed the convoy, preferring to wait until the following morning before engaging the enemy. Dance made use of the delay to gather the smaller country ships on the opposite side of his line from the French, the brig \"Ganges\" shepherding them into position and collecting volunteers from their crews to augment the sailors on board the Indiamen. Linois later excused his delay in attacking the merchant convoy by citing the need for caution:\n\nAt dawn on 15 February, both the British and the French raised their colours. Dance hoped to persuade Linois that his ships included some fully armed warships and he therefore ordered the brig \"Ganges\" and the four lead ships to hoist blue ensigns, while the rest of the convoy raised red ensigns. By the system of national flags then in use in British ships, this implied that the ships with blue ensigns were warships attached to the squadron of Admiral Rainier, while the others were merchant ships under their protection. Dance was unknowingly assisted by the information that had reached Linois at Batavia, which claimed that there were 23 merchant ships and the brig in the convoy. Dance had collected six additional ships during his journey, and the identity of these were unknown to the French, who assumed that at least some of the unidentified vessels must be warships, particularly as several vessels had been recently painted at Canton to resemble ships of the line.\n\nAt 09:00 Linois was still only observing the convoy, reluctant to attack until he could be sure of the nature of his opponents. Dance responded to the reprieve by reforming the line of battle into sailing formation to increase his convoy's speed with the intention of reaching the Straits ahead of Linois. With the convoy a less intimidating target, Linois began to slowly approach the British ships. By 13:00 it was clear that Linois's faster ships were in danger of isolating the rear of the convoy, and Dance ordered his lead ships to tack and come about so they would cross in front of the French squadron. The British successfully executed the manoeuvre, and at 13:15 Linois opened fire on the lead ship—\"Royal George\"—under the command of John Fam Timmins. The \"Royal George\" and the next four ships in line, the Indiaman \"Ganges\", Dance's \"Earl Camden\", the \"Warley\" and the \"Alfred\", all returned fire, \"Ganges\" initially attacking \"Royal George\" in error. Captain James Prendergrass in \"Hope\", the next in line, was so eager to join the battle that he misjudged his speed and collided with \"Warley\", the ships falling back as their crews worked to separate their rigging. Shots were then exchanged at long range for 43 minutes, neither side inflicting severe damage.\n\"Royal George\" had a sailor named Hugh Watt killed, another man wounded, and suffered some damage to her hull. None of the other British ships or any of the French reported anything worse than superficial damage in the engagement. At 14:00, Linois abandoned the action and ordered his squadron to haul away with the wind and sail eastwards, away from the convoy, under all sail. Determined to maintain the pretence of the presence of warships, Dance ordered the ships flying naval ensigns, including his flagship \"Earl Camden\", to chase the French. None of the merchant ships could match the French speed, but an attempt at a chase would hopefully dissuade the French from returning. For two hours, Dance's squadron followed Linois, \"Hope\" coming close to catching \"Aventurier\" but ultimately unable to overtake the brig. At 16:00, Dance decided to gather his scattered ships and return to his former heading rather than risk attack from other raiders or lose sight of his convoy in the darkness. By 20:00, the entire British convoy had anchored at the entrance to the Straits of Malacca. On 28 February, the British ships of the line and joined them in the Strait and conducted them safely to Saint Helena in the South Atlantic.\n\nThere escorted the convoy to England. Five whalers and the \"Carmarthen\", Captain Doree, also joined the convoy, with the \"Blackhouse\", from coast of Guinea, joining at sea. The convoy returned to England without further incident.\n\nLinois's squadron reached Batavia several days after the action without encountering any British ships. He was there joined by \"Atalante\" and, after taking on supplies, made sail for Île de France, arriving on 2 April. The Dutch brig \"Aventurier\" was left at Batavia and remained there until a raid on the port by a British force in November 1806, when it was destroyed. The French admiral later attempted to explain his conduct during the engagement:\n\nNathaniel Dance and his fellow captains were highly praised in the aftermath of the battle: in saving the convoy they had prevented both the HEIC and Lloyd's of London from likely financial ruin, the repercussions of which would have had profound effects across the British Empire. The various commanders and their crews were presented with a £50,000 prize fund to be divided among them, and the Lloyd's Patriotic Fund and other national and mercantile institutions made a series of awards of ceremonial swords, silver plate and monetary gifts to individual officers. Lloyd's Patriotic Fund gave each captain a sword worth 50 pounds, and one to Royal Navy Lieutenant Robert Merrick Fowler, travelling as a passenger on \"Earl Camden\", and one worth 100 pounds to Nathaniel Dance.\n\nDance was specifically rewarded, receiving royal recognition when he was made a Knight Bachelor by King George III. He was also personally presented with the sum of £5,000 by the Bombay Insurance Company and an additional £500 a year for life by the HEIC. Dance immediately retired from the sea to Enfield Town, where he died in 1827. He refused to take full credit for the survival of the convoy, writing in reply to the award from the Bombay Insurance Company:\n\nAmong the passengers on the Indiamen were a number of Royal Navy personnel, survivors of the shipwreck of the exploratory vessel off the coast of New South Wales the previous year. This party—carried aboard \"Ganges\", \"Royal George\" and \"Earl Camden\"—volunteered to assist the gun teams aboard their ships and Dance specifically thanked them in his account of the action. One was Lieutenant Robert Merrick Fowler, the former commander of \"Porpoise\", who distinguished himself in a variety of capacities during the engagement.\n\nSome of the party had influential careers in the Navy, including the naval architect James Inman, who sailed on \"Warley\", and John Franklin, who later became a polar explorer. Also aboard was Indian businessman Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy returning from the second of his five voyages to China.\n\nLinois continued his raiding, achieving some success against individual sailing ships, but failing to press successfully his numerical superiority against British naval forces; most notably at the Battle of Vizagapatam on 15 September 1804 and the Action of 6 August 1805. Ironically, Linois was eventually captured at the Action of 13 March 1806 after mistaking a squadron of British ships of the line for a merchant convoy in the mid-Atlantic. Linois was concerned throughout the engagement for the safety of his ships: with the nearest dockyard over away at Île de France, he could not afford to suffer severe damage to his rigging or masts that would leave his squadron crippled. He also sought to defend his behaviour off Pulo Aura with the claim that the British convoy was protected by as many as eight ships of the line, and that he had performed heroically in saving his squadron from this overwhelming force. Subsequent historians have ridiculed this latter statement: William James wryly commented in his account of the action, written in 1827, that \"it would be uncharitable to call into question the courage of Rear-admiral Linois\" and William Laird Clowes said in 1900 that \"his timidity and want of enterprise threw away a great opportunity\". Nicholas Rodger, writing in 2004, was even more critical, insisting that \"his [Linois's] officers do not seem to have been fooled, and it is extremely difficult to believe that he was.\" He goes on to suggest that no experienced seaman could possibly have mistaken a poorly manned and poorly trained merchant crew for the crew of a real Royal Navy ship of the line, concluding that \"Linois had thrown away a prize worth at least £8 million through mere timidity\". The most scathing criticism of Linois's conduct came from Napoleon himself, who wrote to Minister of Marine Denis Decrès on the subject, stating:\n\nThe battle has been fictionalised twice, in Captain Frederick Marryat's 1832 novel \"Newton Forster; or, the Merchant Service\", and in Patrick O'Brian's novel \"HMS Surprise\", published in 1973. In O'Brian's novel, Royal Navy Captain Jack Aubrey aids the China Fleet, organizing the Indiamen who then succeeded as in history. The rewards were shed on Aubrey, rather than the lead merchant captain. \n\n"}

It functions as a connector highway wholly contained in Grand Traverse County, which is located in the northwestern Lower Peninsula. The western terminus is at M-113 east of Kingsley and the eastern terminus is at U.S. Highway 131 (US 131) west of downtown Fife Lake. The current incarnation of M-186 is the second usage of the designation. The first was used for a highway in the Upper Peninsula in the 1930s.\n\nM-186 forms an easterly extension of M-113 from Kingsley to Fife Lake. M-186 starts south of a ninety-degree curve in M-113 and runs east through flat, wooded terrain to Fife Lake. The roadway runs parallel to the survey section lines in Fife Lake Township, and it passes several residences along the whole length. From the eastern terminus, State Street connects M-186 and US 131 with downtown Fife Lake.\nIn 2007, the average annual daily traffic (AADT) surveys conducted by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) showed that 2,100 vehicles used M-186. M-113 west of M-186 logged an average of 7,800 vehicles a day north of the junction and 4,400 vehicles south of the junction. On the east end, US 131 carried 5,100 vehicles north and 4,800 vehicles south of the junction in Fife Lake. Of the 2,100 vehicles on M-186, only 140 trucks travelled the highway each day on average.\n\nIn the 1930s, M-186 was designated on a connector route in the Upper Peninsula between US 2/US 41 at Rapid River and M-35 near Brampton. This designation existed from 1933 until July 26, 1939, forming a route for westbound US 2 traffic to access M-35 northbound towards Gwinn and Negaunee.\n\nIn 1940, US 131 ended at a three-way convergence with M-113 and M-131 four miles (6 km) north of Walton Junction in Paradise Township. From this intersection, US 131 ran south to Walton Junction, M-113 ran west to Kingsley, and M-131 ran east toward Fife Lake before turning north to Petoskey. A new alignment of US 131 was built from Walton Junction directly to Fife Lake. This formed a third leg of a triangle of roads, allowing US 131 to bypass the Paradise Township intersection. US 131 replaced M-131 north from Fife Lake to Petoskey. M-113 was extended along the former section of US 131 south to Walton Junction. The remaining leg of the triangle from Paradise Township to Fife Lake along a portion of the former M-131 was designated M-186 at this time.\n\nIn 2017, MDOT announced plans to build a roundabout at the eastern terminus of M-186 at US-131. This is the result of many crashes at this intersection (nearly 80 from 2007 to 2017), many of which because of low visibility. The project was supposed to be started and completed in the first half of 2019, although the project was finished in late July of that year.\n\n"}

Peca currently is the general manager and director of hockey operations for the Buffalo Jr. Sabres, a Junior A hockey team owned by the Buffalo Sabres, one of two teams he captained.\n\nPeca began his junior career with the Sudbury Wolves of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) after they selected him in the first round of the 1990 player draft. He was traded to the Ottawa 67's where he blossomed into one of the league's top offensive players. He was drafted in the second round, 40th overall, by the Vancouver Canucks in the 1992 NHL Entry Draft. He made his NHL debut with the Canucks in the 1993–94 season, playing four games before cracking the lineup as a regular in the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season. He would then be traded to the Buffalo Sabres during the 1995 NHL Entry Draft as part of a package that sent Alexander Mogilny from Buffalo to Vancouver.\n\nPeca twice won the Frank J. Selke Trophy for being the best defensive forward, in 1996–97 and 2001–02. He captained the Buffalo Sabres to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1999. His nickname was \"Captain Crunch\" because of his penchant for delivering bone-crushing open ice hits.\n\nFor the 2000–01 season, Peca and the Buffalo Sabres could not agree on a contract. Peca went without a contract the entire season. Peca was later traded to the New York Islanders in exchange for Tim Connolly and Taylor Pyatt, where he led the Islanders to their first playoff berth in seven years. Peca was hip-checked by Toronto Maple Leafs' Darcy Tucker during the 2002 Stanley Cup playoffs in game five of the first round. The check blew out Peca's MCL and ACL on his left knee, ending his season and delaying his entry into the 2002–03 season. No penalty was assessed, but the NHL made clipping illegal as a result of the incident.\n\nPeca was acquired by the Edmonton Oilers in a trade with the Islanders in exchange for Mike York. He was part of the Cinderella Edmonton Oiler team that made a run to the Stanley Cup Finals. Peca had six goals and five assists in the 2006 playoffs.\n\nOn July 18, 2006, the Toronto Maple Leafs announced that they had signed Peca as a free agent to a one-year, $2.5 million contract for the 2006–07 season, making Tucker and Peca teammates. During a game against the Chicago Blackhawks on December 22, 2006, Peca collided with Chicago defenceman Jim Vandermeer with 5:17 left in the first period. Vandermeer was assessed a minor penalty and a game misconduct for the hit. Peca sustained a fractured tibia at the base of his right knee and suffered significant ligament damage, and missed the remainder of the 2006–07 season.\n\nOn August 21, 2007, Peca signed a one-year contract with the Columbus Blue Jackets. On October 11, 2008, he received an indefinite suspension (later reduced to a five-game suspension) after grabbing referee Greg Kimmerly's arm in Columbus' first game of the 2008–09 season.\n\nOn January 19, 2010, through the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA), Peca announced his retirement from professional hockey.\n\nPeca was first selected to represent Canada at the 1994 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, capturing the gold medal.

The ship was originally built in Belfast by William J. Woodside and was launched in 1885. \"Polly Woodside\" is typical of thousands of smaller iron barques built in the last days of sail, intended for deep water trade around the world and designed to be operated as economically as possible.\n\n\"Polly Woodside\" was built at the north shipbuilding yard of Workman, Clark and Co, Queen's Island, Belfast during 1885, for William J. Woodside and Co. She was launched on 7 November 1885; the christening performed by the owner's wife, Mrs Marian (\"Polly\") Woodside, after whom the ship was named. \"Polly Woodside\" captained by Gilbert Yeates, operated as a cargo vessel carrying coal, nitrate, and wheat between British ports and the ports of South America, such as Montevideo, Valparaiso and Buenos Aires. In sixteen voyages between December 1885 and August 1903 she made a number of arduous passages around Cape Horn. The \"Polly Woodside's\" operating crew, including master and mate was generally less than 20.\n\nIn 1904 \"Polly Woodside\" was sold to A.H. Turnbull of New Zealand and renamed \"Rona\" after Miss Rona Monro, daughter of a shareholder in the company. Valued in 1906 at £4,300, \"Rona\" then generally operated on the New Zealand–Australian run, carrying timber, salt, cement, grain and coal. The ship changed hands in 1911 for £3000 to Captain Harrison Douglas, of New Zealand and again in 1916 to the George H. Scales Company. Because of the heavy loss of shipping in the 1914–1918 war, \"Rona\" also traded between New Zealand ports and San Francisco, carrying case oil and copra. Two mishaps occurred in the last years of the ship's sailing career. In March 1920 the schooner \"W. J. Pirie\", under tow in San Francisco harbour, collided with \"Rona\" at anchor, carrying away her headgear. Then in June 1921 the \"Rona\", carrying a cargo of coal, grounded on Steeple Rock, off Wellington Heads. The shingle bottom caused little damage and she was able to be towed into Wellington harbour. However, some slight stress fractures to the hull plating could still be seen when the ship was dry-docked in 1974.\n\nMaritime historian Georg Kåhre has described the early 1920s as the final abandonment of sail by most of the world's maritime nations. \"In the hectic economic climate of the great war there had been no question of scrap prices [for sailing ships].\" However, by 1922 this had changed. \"World freight rates were sliding in the post war slump; what had been marginal before was now uneconomic.\" A few larger sailing ships defied this trend, but not the relatively small \"Rona\". In September 1921 the ship was laid up, then sold to Adelaide Steamship Company for service as a coal hulk in Australia. She arrived in Sydney on 8 October 1922, and by early 1923 had been stripped down. In March 1925 the \"Lammeroo\" towed \"Rona\" to Melbourne for this purpose. She spent the next 40 years quite unremarkably, bunkering coal-burning ships in the Port of Melbourne. An exception was her war service; during the Second World War. In 1943 she was requisitioned as a dumb lighter (coal hulk) by the Royal Australian Navy for service with other hulks in New Guinea waters. She was taken under tow of ST Tooronga on 28 October 1943 and arrived in Cairns on 19 November 1943. She was then taken in tow by ST Wato and towed to Milne Bay in New Guinea waters. Captain Douglas Strath described her thus; \"queen of this dumb (ie lacking self propulsion) but mighty workforce was \"Rona\". She was big enough to supply, unload, store, repair, construct and function in so many ways... she was an integral part of the vital servicing fleet.\" She was towed back to Melbourne in 1946, resuming her career as a coal hulk.\n\nA number of half-hearted efforts were made in the mid 20th century to preserve Australia's sailing heritage, at the same time as it rapidly disappeared from Australian ports. In 1934, the Shiplover's Society of Victoria arranged for the coal hulk \"Shandon\" (a 1,400 ton former barque) to be partially re-rigged and refitted as a static display, to celebrate the centenary of European settlement. However, by the early 1960s, \"Rona\" was the last of her kind still afloat in Australia. A few others lay full of water, abandoned and forgotten – the \"James Craig\" in Recherche Bay, Tasmania; the \"Santiago\" in the Port River, near Adelaide. The \"Polly Woodside's\" restoration owes much to the efforts of Karl Kortum, former director of the San Francisco Maritime Museum, who inspired Dr. Graeme Robertson of the National Trust of Australia (Victoria) to put up a proposal to save the ship in 1962. In the context of the time, this proposal was quite risky but showed extraordinary vision. The National Trust of Australia relied entirely on volunteer labour, and it had no experience in restoring a sailing ship, even for static display. The restoration of the \"Rona/Polly Woodside\" would be a massive task. A long campaign led to the National Trust of Australia purchasing her from Howard Smith Industries for one cent in 1968.\n\nAn estimated 60,000 hours of painstaking voluntary labour saw the ship refurbished close to its original state. The project received strong support from businesses, unions, former crewmembers and several Captains. The first Master of Restoration, Captain G.H.Heyen was a master in sail. \"Polly Woodside's\" chief rigger for 27 years of restoration was Tor Lindqvist, a former able seaman and sailmaker on Lawhill, Passat and Viking. In 1978 she was opened under her original name to the public, and is now permanently moored at the old Duke and Orr's Dry Dock on the Yarra River near Melbourne. Now landlocked by a nearby roadbridge, she cannot take to sea like the restored barque James Craig, of Sydney.\n\nIn 1988 the World Ship Trust awarded their seventh maritime heritage award to \"Polly Woodside\", for \"supreme achievement in the preservation of maritime heritage\" — a first for a restored merchant ship. In March 2007, \"Polly Woodside\" was added to the Victorian Heritage Register.\n\n\"Polly Woodside\" was closed to the public on 30 April 2006 to allow for the major redevelopment of the lower Yarra River's southern bank. The $1.4 billion redevelopment, announced by the Victorian Government in February 2006, included construction works for the new Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre immediately next to the \"Polly Woodside\". The ship was temporarily relocated approximately 50 metres away to a mooring on the adjacent Yarra River on 26 August 2008 – its first move in 33 years – for a $13 million operational refurbishment and restoration of its dry dock home, board walk, and adjacent former wharf sheds. Between this time and May 2009 the water within the Duke and Orr's Dry Dock was pumped out and a gated dam wall built at the entrance. The bottom of the dry dock was excavated and permanent keel supports built into the concrete base for \"Polly Woodside\" to sit upon, allowing the ship to be periodically dry docked for repairs. On 19 May 2009 the dam wall gates were opened allowing water to flow into the dry dock and \"Polly Woodside\" was returned to the Duke and Orr's Dry Dock. \"Polly Woodside\" was reopened to the public on 23 December 2010.\n\n"}

For a time period in the 1980s, M-91 was even a discontinuous highway when a section in the middle was transferred to county control before the southernmost section was transferred.\n\nM-91 starts at an intersection with M-44 west of Belding in Otisco Township. The road runs north along Storey Road and past the Candlestone Golf Course and farmlands. At Bricker Road, M-91 crosses out of Ionia County into Montcalm County. The trunkline runs along Greenville Road and passes the Greenville Municipal Airport. As it continues north, the highway curves to the northeast running between the Flat River and Baldwin, Como and Manoka lakes. As it enters the south side of Greenville, M-91 runs along on Lafayette Street. In the center of Greenville, M-91 meets M-57 on Washington Street. North of downtown, M-91 crosses a bend in the Flat River and continues to parallel the river on the east out of town. In rural Montcalm County, M-91 is once again named Greenville Road and it curves to the west of Turk Lake and continues due north to the community of Langston. North of Langston are Tacoma, West and Spring lakes. Further north, M-91 curves to the northwest around Farnsworth Lake, resuming its due-north course a mile (1.6 km) to the west . Running through farmlands again, M-91 terminates at an intersection with M-46 in Lakeview, just south of Tamarack Lake.\n\nThe first routing of M-91 in Michigan was located between Menominee and Cedar River in the Upper Peninsula. This routing was designated by July 1, 1919. The designation remained until sometime before December 1927 when it was replaced by M-35.\n\nIn 1927, all of the current M-91 was originally part of M-66. A second usage of M-91 was designated from Rogers City towards Cheboygan County along the Lake Huron shore by 1930. It became part of US 23 by the end of 1940.\n\nM-91 was designated for the third time by June 1942. The number was assigned between US 16 (Cascade Road/Grand River Avenue) south of Lowell running northeast along Alden Nash Avenue into Lowell and Lincoln Lake Road north of town. The highway followed Lincoln Lake Road to M-44 east of Belding and turned to run concurrently along M-44 to the Belding area. From there it ran north to Greenville and on to Lakeview along the present route. The last section of gravel roadway was paved in Ionia County in 1954.\n\nThe highway designation was extended south to the then-new US 16 freeway (now Interstate 96) around 1958. It was later truncated back to M-21 in Lowell in 1968. By 1980, the section of M-91 in Ionia County south of M-44 to the Kent County line was turned back to local control. The highway section in Kent County remained marked as M-91, resulting in a discontinuous highway. The southern section between Lowell and the county line was turned back by 1985, resulting in the modern routing of M-91.\n\n"}

It is named after the famous psychiatric institution of Bethlem Royal Hospital, which is commonly known as Bedlam.\n\nInitially lingering in the lower regions of the UK Albums Chart in its first few months of release, it became a major international success after its third single, \"You're Beautiful\", became a worldwide hit in the summer of 2005. \"Back to Bedlam\" would go on to become the highest-selling album of 2005 in the UK, with over 2.4 million copies sold. By December 2009, the album had been certified 10× Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry for sales of over 3 million, making it the best-selling album of the 2000s in the UK. In 2011, it was overtaken by Amy Winehouse's \"Back to Black\" as the best-selling album of the 21st century in the UK. \"Back to Bedlam\" currently ranks as the 18th best-selling album in UK chart history. As of 2017, it has sold 3.33 million copies in the UK and over 11 million copies worldwide.\n\nBlunt had piano and violin lessons as a child, but his first significant exposure to popular music was at Harrow School. There, he was introduced to the guitar by a fellow student, and started playing the instrument and writing songs at age 14. At University of Bristol, his undergraduate thesis was \"The Commodification of Image – Production of a Pop Idol\"; one of his main references for the thesis was sociologist and rock critic, Simon Frith, chairman of the Mercury Music Prize panel of judges since 1992.\n\nBecause the British Army sponsored his university education, Blunt was obliged to serve a minimum of four years in the armed forces. He stated on an interview in his \"Back to Bedlam\" sessions that he chose to join the military as his father was \"pushing for it, so that [Blunt] could obtain a secure work placement and income\". Blunt trained at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. While still in the army, he worked on demos during his time off. A backing vocalist and songwriting collaborator suggested he contact Elton John's manager Todd Interland, with whom she used to share a house. Interland told HitQuarters that he listened to Blunt's demo while driving home and after hearing the track \"Goodbye My Lover\", pulled over and called the mobile number written on the CD to set up a meeting.\n\nBlunt left the British Army in 2002 so that he could pursue his musical career. It was at that period that he started using the stage name \"Blunt\", in part to make it easier for others to spell; \"Blount\" is pronounced the same way, and remains his legal surname. Shortly after leaving the army, he was signed to EMI music publishers and Twenty-First Artists management. A record contract remained elusive, with recording label executives pointing to Blunt's posh speaking voice as a barrier in class-divided Britain. Linda Perry, who was just launching her own Custard Records label in early 2003, heard Blunt's promotional tape when visiting London, and soon after heard him perform live at the South by Southwest Music Festival. She made an offer to him the same night and within a few days, Blunt signed a recording contract with Perry, and one month later he was in Los Angeles working with producer Tom Rothrock.\n\nBlunt recorded \"Back to Bedlam\" in 2003 with producer Tom Rothrock at Rothrock's home studio, using session musicians and performing on many different instruments himself. While in Los Angeles, he lodged with actress Carrie Fisher, whom he had met through the family of a former girlfriend. Fisher was very supportive of Blunt's aspirations, suggesting the name of the album and providing use of a bathroom in her home for Blunt to record the song \"Goodbye My Lover\".\n\nAllMusic felt \"...the Soulful British crooner James Blunt's wistful debut infuses the listener – in order – with rainy-day hope, the wistful comfort of unattainable love, and finally, world-weary resignation. While his parched and effeminate falsetto recalls Gasoline Alley-era Rod Stewart with a healthy dose of Antony and the Johnsons, it's the late Elliott Smith who casts the largest shadow on \"Back to Bedlam\".\" \"Q\" magazine and Common Sense Media awarded the album four stars out of five. RocknWorld stated \"It's hard to describe James Blunt or his music without falling prey to many a cliché or hyperbole. Comes from the UK, serves in the army then makes an album of movingly sincere ballads which make a huge impression on his homeland and Australia, thus allowing him to enjoy phenomenal, chart topping success. However, in this case, the music Blunt is making does really deserve and warrant the hype surrounding him. Strangely enough, even with his music being all over the radio here in Australia, I cannot begrudge the fact that Blunt is truly talented and has made himself a damn good debut record.\" BBC Collective said \"It's very rare I give an album 5 stars. Many have come close, but just missing it. I never thought i would say this, but \"Back To Bedlam\" has not got one bad track on it. I've listened to it 3 times back to back, just to make sure.\" Slant Magazine said, in a three and a half star review, that \"Bedlam is an overall raw listening experience\" and that though \"Blunt's writing often juxtaposes love with death\" that it's \"More reason for American girls to go gaga over this able British bloke.\"\n\nIndie London praised the album, and went on to call it \"...a masterful debut and one which you mustn't allow to pass you by.\" In a 4 star review, About.com said that \"To aptly describe James Blunt's music in his debut album \"Back to Bedlam\", it would be an injustice to ignore the backdrop of his past and its relation to his music – in fact it's impossible to do so\" and gave praise to the songs which they called \"Hauntingly captivating, his words paint the pictures of many stories lived, masterly recited through his songs. \"Back to Bedlam\" seems not so much a pop compilation as it does a reflection of a life through the art of music.\" Nate Murray of \"Relevant\" gave a similar review, and compared his work to the likes of Elliott Smith, calling it \"endearingly honest\" and continued \"...like any great writer, he invites the reader, or in this case, the listener, into the intimate details of life that resonate with most anyone. Combine such candid writing with a voice one interviewer has called 'disgustingly gorgeous', and you have a recipe for musical addiction. Blunt's talents have earned the endorsement of Elton John and led to comparisons with John’s early work, as well as the late Elliott Smith.\"\n\n\nEight of the ten songs on \"Back to Bedlam\" were licensed for use in television shows, movies, advertising campaigns and trailers, a total of 34 times. This included \"Tears and Rain\", \"So Long Jimmy\" and \"Cry\", tracks that had not been released as singles.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1887046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887046", "title": "Coreidae", "text": "Coreidae\n\nCoreidae is a large family of predominantly sap-suckling insects in the Hemipteran suborder Heteroptera. The name \"Coreidae\" derives from the genus \"Coreus\", which derives from the Ancient Greek () meaning bedbug.\n\nAs a family, the Coreidae are cosmopolitan, but most of the species are tropical or subtropical.\n\nThe common names of the Coreidae vary regionally. Leaf-footed bug refers to leaf-like expansions on the legs of some species, generally on the hind tibiae. In North America, the pest status of species such as \"Anasa tristis\" on squash plants and other cucurbits gave rise to the name squash bugs. The Coreidae are called twig-wilters or tip-wilters in parts of Africa and Australia because many species feed on young twigs, injecting enzymes that macerate the tissues of the growing tips and cause them to wilt abruptly.\n\nThe Coreidae commonly are oval-shaped, with antennae composed of four segments, numerous veins in the membrane of the fore wings, and externally visible repugnatorial stink glands. They vary in size from 7 to 45 mm long, which implies that the family includes some of the biggest species of Heteroptera. The body shape is quite variable; some species are broadly oval, others are elongated with parallel sides, and a few are slender. Many species with the \"leaf-footed\" tibiae are very slender with conspicuous expansions of the hind tibiae, but some robust species also have decided expansions. Some species are covered with spines and tubercles. As an example of these, the tribe Phyllomorphini Mulsant & Rey, 1870, are strikingly , with thin legs, spiny bristles, and outlines and adornments.\n\nMany of the more robust species have grossly enlarged, thickened, and bowed hind femora armed with spikes on the inner edge, and with hind tibiae to match, though the enlargement of the tibiae is less exaggerated.\n\nIn the nymphs, the openings of the two stink glands of the Coreidae are visible as two projections or spots on the medial line of the dorsal surface of the abdomen, one at the anterior and one at the posterior edge of the fifth abdominal tergite above the glands inside. During the final ecdysis, the anatomy is rearranged and the glands end up in the metathorax, opening laterally through ostioles between the mesothoracic and metathoracic pleura.\n\nThe Coreidae generally feed on the sap of plants. Some species reportedly are actively carnivorous, but material evidence is lacking, and in the field, some are easy to confuse with some species of the Reduviidae, so doubt has been cast on the veracity of the claims.\n\nSome Coreidae, such as \"Phyllomorpha laciniata\", exhibit parental care by carrying their eggs. This behaviour significantly improves the eggs' chances of avoiding the attacks of parasitoids.\n\nThe Coreidae are placed in the order Hemiptera and closely related to the families Alydidae, Hyocephalidae, Rhopalidae, and Stenocephalidae. Together, these five families form the superfamily Coreoidea. The family is large, with more than 1,900 species in over 270 genera.\n\nMost taxonomists dealing with the Coreidae divide the family into three or sometimes four subfamilies. Numerous tribes of the Coreinae have previously been proposed for elevation to subfamily rank, for example, the Agriopocorini, Colpurini, Hydarini, Phyllomorphini, and Procamptini, but the only one of these changes that at least a significant minority of researchers currently accept is the elevation of the Agriopocorinae, and recent reviews tend to treat them as a tribe again, recognizing only the three subfamilies known by 1867. Another difficulty is that the genus \"Eubule\" has not yet been placed.\n\nAccordingly, the subfamilies are as follows, together with illustrative genera of each:\n\nCoreinae \n\n\nAgriopocorinae (often included in Coreinae)\n\nMeropachyinae \nPseudophloeinae \n"}

His exact birthplace is unknown because his family was on the move at the time of his birth. After graduating from high school in Celje he entered the Roman Catholic theological seminary in Maribor. He was ordained a priest in 1880. The same year he published his first poem entitled \"Trije popotniki\" (\"The Three Travelers\") in the progressive literary magazine \"Ljubljanski zvon\".\n\nHe started his literary career by writing lyric poetry, but after 1882 moved to more epic themes. His post-romantic poems express his patriotism, love and religious doubt. The themes of his ballades and romances come from Slovene and Slavic history, the Bible, folk traditions as well as contemporary life. He became strongly influenced by literary realism, writing some of his best known poems in this style, but never fully rejected post-romanticism.\n\nAškerc published his poems in the journal \"Ljubljanski zvon\" under the pseudonym \"Gorázd\" from 1881, but used his real name in his first poetry collection, \"Balade in romance\" (\"Ballades and Romances\") published in 1890. The collection was warmly accepted by the reading public and critics, but was criticized from the emerging Catholic political activists, such as the bishop Anton Mahnič, who disapproved of Aškerc's national, freethinking and progressive social ideals. Aškerc took an early retirement from his priesthood service. Soon afterwards, he was appointed by Ivan Hribar, the liberal mayor of Ljubljana, as a chief archivist of the Ljubljana City Archives, which he remained until his death. \n\nDuring the last twenty years of his life, his relationship with the conservative Catholic clergy worsened, as did the quality of his literary work. He continued to enjoy full support from the liberal political establishment in Carniola, led by Ivan Tavčar and Ivan Hribar. His friendship with the Swedish slavist and historian Alfred Anton Jensen opened him the doors to international recognition: his poems were published in Sweden, Russia, Galicia, Croatia, Serbia, and in the Czech Lands. However, he started losing his influence over younger Slovenian authors. He rejected the poetry of Dragotin Kette and Josip Murn and entered in a dispute with the poet Oton Župančič, from which he came as a clear loser. The young writer Ivan Cankar, whom Aškerc admired, also published several critically sarcastic essays on Aškerc's late poetry, in which he targeted Aškerc as being the symptom of the decay of old the Slovenian provincial national-liberal élite.\n\nDespite the bitter last years of his life – in addition to everything mentioned, he lived in a constant fear of losing his job if the conservative Slovenian People's Party had won the municipal elections, which didn't happen -, his funeral in Ljubljana was attended by a huge mass of people, among whom were many of his former adversaries.\n\nOne of the main thoroughfares in south-central Ljubljana, Aškerc Street (), is named after him, as are several other public places and institutions.\n\n\n"}

He turned professional in 1956 but continued to play for the youth team until the following year, and was captain of the FA Youth Cup winning team in 1957.\n\nHe made his first team debut on 21 December 1957, aged 18, against Leicester City in a league match at Old Trafford, and was soon the club's first-choice outside-right, at the expense of the older and more experienced Johnny Berry.\n\nHe was injured in the Munich air disaster on 6 February 1958, when still only 18 years old. He was the youngest player involved in the crash and the last survivor to be rescued from the mangled wreckage of the BEA Elizabethan airliner after he was found unconscious amongst the debris by two journalists five hours after the official search was called off. He had played in the last match before the disaster, the European Cup quarter-final second leg against Red Star Belgrade, and had so far made 10 senior appearances for United. He was in hospital for around three weeks after the crash.\n\nAlthough he made a full recovery following the crash and was back in the side before the end of the season, playing a further nine games, he showed little of his previous form on the pitch, and made just four appearances for the first team over the next three seasons.\n\nHe finally left United in 1961, having made 23 first-team appearances without scoring a goal, and signed for Swansea Town in a £3,000 deal.

They were fitness fanatics who often made fun of their opponents and the fans. They also demonstrated how fit they were by doing jumping jacks during Skip's matches and performed push ups on fallen opponents.\n\nOn the July 9, 1995 episode of \"WWF Wrestling Challenge\", Skip was defeated in a booked loss to longtime jobber Barry Horowitz. He got into a feud with Horowitz and lost several more matches. A subsequent storyline saw the Bodydonnas approached by Rad Radford, who wanted to be a Bodydonna. He teamed with Skip until Sunny fired him after The Smoking Gunns defeated the Bodydonnas on the December 23, 1995 episode of \"Superstars\".\n\nSkip soon got another partner who was an official Bodydonna in Zip (originally Flip), his kayfabe cousin.

{"id": "1887082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887082", "title": "Edward Bernds", "text": "Edward Bernds\n\nEdward Bernds (July 12, 1905May 20, 2000) was an American screenwriter and director, born in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nWhile in his junior year in Lake View High School, he and several friends formed a small radio clique and obtained amateur licenses. In the early 1920s, there was considerable prestige for amateur operators to have commercial radio licenses, and Bernds was in a good position to enter broadcasting when he graduated in 1923, a year when radio stations began to be established all over Chicago. He found employment — at age 20 — as chief operator at Chicago's WENR.\n\nWhen talking pictures began in the late 1920s, Bernds and broadcast operators like him relocated to Hollywood to work as sound technicians in \"the talkies\". After a brief period at United Artists, Bernds resigned and worked at Columbia Pictures, where he functioned as sound engineer on many of Frank Capra's classics in the 1930s. He soon established himself as Columbia's best recording technician.\n\nBernds wanted to be a director, but could not work up the nerve to approach Columbia president Harry Cohn about the reassignment. Frank Capra ran into Bernds one day, and made Bernds promise to talk with Cohn that evening. Cohn, although well aware of Bernds's prowess in the sound department, grudgingly granted Bernds's wish.\n\nIn 1945, Bernds became a screenwriter and director, first for the Three Stooges short subjects. His first effort with the team was the lackluster \"A Bird in the Head\" (1946), which features an ailing Curly Howard. The 41-year-old Howard had suffered a series of minor strokes prior to filming; as a result, his tired performances were marred by slurred speech and slower timing. Though Bernds was initially thrilled at being a director, he was horrified when he realized that Curly was in such bad shape (something Columbia short-subject head Jules White failed to tell Bernds). Years later, Bernds discussed his trying experience during the filming of \"A Bird in the Head\":\nRealizing that Curly was no longer able to perform in the same capacity as before, Bernds devised ways to cover his illness. Curly could still be the star, but the action was shifted away from the ailing Stooge. In \"A Bird in the Head\", the action focuses more on crazy Professor Panzer and Igor. This allowed Curly to maintain a healthy amount of screen time without being required to contribute much.\n\nBernds often commented that he and Jules White never really got along. As a result, Bernds feared that his directing days would be over as soon as they began if he released \"A Bird in the Head\" with a weak Curly as his first entry. Producer Hugh McCollum reshuffled the release order, and the superior \"Micro-Phonies\" (1945) was released first, securing Bernds's directing position. Bernds struggled through three additional films, all released in 1946, (\"The Three Troubledoers\", \"Monkey Businessmen\" and \"Three Little Pirates\", with Curly in varying stages of decline) until the comedian suffered a debilitating stroke that ended his career. When Shemp Howard replaced his brother Curly as the third Stooge, it breathed new life into the Stooges' films, and allowed Bernds to add new flair and wit to the team's antics.\n\nColumbia's short-subject department operated two units, one headed by Jules White, the other by Hugh McCollum. Edward Bernds worked for the McCollum unit, usually collaborating on scripts with Elwood Ullman. Every Columbia series alternated between the White and McCollum units, allowing Bernds to direct the other Columbia comedians: Shemp Howard. Hugh Herbert, Andy Clyde, Gus Schilling and Richard Lane, Joe Besser, Curly Joe DeRita, Vera Vague, Wally Vernon and Eddie Quillan, Harry Von Zell, and Billie Burke, among others. Bernds also began directing the feature-length \"Blondie\" series of comedies with Penny Singleton and Arthur Lake.\n\nWhen the Columbia shorts department downsized in 1952, Hugh McCollum was fired and Bernds voluntarily resigned, out of loyalty to McCollum.\n\nIn 1950 Bernds directed \"Gold Raiders\", an independently produced comedy-western co-starring veteran cowboy star George O'Brien and The Three Stooges. This led to an assignment at the Allied Artists studio, directing action features starring Stanley Clements, which in turn led Bernds into Allied Artists' breadwinning series starring The Bowery Boys. Bernds directed Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, and company as though he was still working with the Stooges; the Bernds efforts in the series have the most slapstick content.\n\nBernds has the distinction of receiving an Oscar nomination by mistake. In 1956 the Academy nominated him and co-writer Elwood Ullman for the screen story to \"High Society\". The Academy actually intended the nomination to be for the big-budget Frank Sinatra-Bing Crosby musical. Bernds and Ullman \"did\" make a film in 1955 called \"High Society\" — but theirs was a low-budget feature with The Bowery Boys. Graciously and voluntarily, Bernds and Ullman withdrew their nomination, though it still stands in the record books.\n\nBernds graduated to dramatic features in the late 1950s, although he was reunited with the Three Stooges in the 1960s for their feature films, and the live-action portions of their TV cartoons in \"The New 3 Stooges\"; due to their advancing age (Moe and Larry were in their 60s by this point) and the constraints of children's television, he was forced to tone down much of the slapstick. He and Ullman also collaborated on an Elvis Presley feature for Allied Artists, \"Tickle Me\". His best-known work from this time period is arguably the 1959 horror film \"Return of the Fly\". Bernds is also known for directing the cult classic science fiction films \"World Without End\", \"Queen of Outer Space\" and \"Valley of the Dragons\". Although Bernds had become a proficient all-around director, he confessed to enjoying his short-subject comedies more. Bernds retired in 1965.\n\nBernds's autobiography is \"Mr. Bernds Goes to Hollywood,\" published in 1999. It details the earlier stages of his career, before he was a director. Bernds's directorial career is chronicled in \"The Columbia Comedy Shorts,\" first published in 1986; Bernds wrote the foreword and is quoted throughout.\n\nOutliving most of his peers, Edward Bernds died peacefully on May 20, 2000, in Van Nuys, California.\n\n\n"}

It is Canada's Snow Goose Capital, and festivals include the International Accordion Festival in September and the Festival of the Snow Geese in October.\n\nThe city was named after Charles de Montmagny, the first to have the title of governor of New France. (Samuel de Champlain was commander in chief.)\n\nMontmagny was the county seat of the former Montmagny County.\n\nMontmagny is northwest of the Notre Dame Mountains, more commonly but unofficially called the Canadian extension of the Green Mountains as they are called in New England. While \"Mont Notre Dame\" is the official name, the vast majority of people living in the area stretching from Quebec City to the Gaspé Peninsula refer to them as simply \"the Appalachians\" (French: \"les Appalaches\"), the origin of the official designation of the region comprising Quebec City's South Shore suburbia to the US border to the east and the northeast, which is known as \"Chaudière-Appalaches\", after the mountains and the main river flowing down from them into the St. Lawrence River \n\nThe city of Montmagny itself is parted by the South River (French: \"Rivière du Sud\"), where a smaller river, Bras-Saint-Nicolas, merges into it.

{"id": "1887099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887099", "title": "Wiesmoor", "text": "Wiesmoor\n\nWiesmoor is a city in the district of Aurich in the northwest of Lower Saxony. It lies on the Nordgeorgsfehnkanal and is the youngest city in the East Frisia area having been bestowed city rights on the 16th of March 2006, two days later on the 18th of March 2006, Wiesmoor celebrated the Centenary of the settlements founding. The city owes its growth to the industrialisation of the harvesting of peat from the surrounding moors. Wiesmoor holds an annual flower festival and the city is also known as the ‘Flower City’, the name originates from the large numbers of flowers which are grown in the city’s industrial greenhouse. Formerly the greenhouses were heated by waste heat from the now defunct peat burning power station which was located in the city. Wiesmoor also has the official title of a Luftkurort; tourism now plays an important role in the local economy.\n\nWiesmoor liesaround 30 km inland from the North Sea in the North West of Germany in the centre of the historic district East Frisia. The city of Wiesmoor and its surroundings have a population of between 35,000 and 40,000 people.\n\nThe most South-Easterly community in the Landkreis of Aurich Wiesmoor lies centrally within the East Frisian peninsula. The city is in the district Aurich. In the East, the city borders with the Friedeburg in the district of Wittmund, in the south with Uplengen in the district of Leer. West of Wiesmoor is the village of Großefehn lies and to the North of that the city of Aurich, both in the district of Aurich.\n\nThe closest large cities to Wiesmoor are Wilhelmshaven (30 km to the North East), Oldenburg (45 km to the South East), Bremen (80 km to the South East) as well as the Dutch city of Groningen (80 km to the South West).\nThe entire metropolitan area of Wiesmoor extends to an area of 82.99 km². The city has dimensions of approximately 11 km in the North-South direction and about 7 km in the East-West Direction.\n\nThe city of Wiesmoor lies in the middle part of the East Frisian raised bog, which was formed by glaciation, and contained up to 1900 layers of peat up to 8m deep. Originally the bog had an area of around 100km2 although the majority of that is now covered by the city.\n\nThe city ranges over heights of 10.6 to 14m above sea level, with the average being 11m.\n\nWiesmoor was laid out in 1906, the city today consists of the original 20th century planned city and an additional 9 quarters. A peculiarity of Wiesmoor lies therein that almost all current quarters of the city are older than the City Centre itself.\n\nThe bog area around Wiesmoor remained mostly uninhabited for a long time. The earliest records for the presence of people are a Stone Age axe and an earthen vessel from the pre-Roman Iron Age that were discovered in Marcardsmoor. It is likely that these items belonged to someone who drowned in the bog rather than an indication of a durable settlement. In the bog in Wilhelmsfehn a neck ring from around 700BCE has also been found. In 1999 a bronze hatchet which has dated to the middle of the Bronze Age was discovered amongst rubbish in Ostgroßefehn. The hatchet is unique to East Frisia and it is likely that it was disposed of in the bog rather than originating in the area.\n\nIn 1633 colonisation of the bog area surrounding Wiesmoor began, however by 1880 there was still only around 100 inhabitants living within the current city area. In the beginning of the 20th century plans were drawn up by Dr. Eberhard Ramm from the Prussian Ministry of Agriculture to begin industrial harvesting of peat from the bogs, this would be done use large machinery rather than the traditional methods of spades and hoes. Further to this Dr. Ramm, in co-operation with Carl Friedrich von Siemens, also planned to construct a new peat burning power plant in the area.\n\nIn 1906, the Nordgeorgsfehnkanal was constructed through the bog in order to be able to drain the area. While in the beginning only specialists and prison labourers came to work by 1907 the first residents to Wiesmoor began to arrive and by 1909 the peat power plant was in operation. The plant was originally owned by Siemens until 1921 when it was taken over by the North West German Power Plants Company (Nordwestdeutschen Kraftwerke AG). The plant provided power all the way from Ems down to the lower Elbe. The waste heat from the power plant was used from 1925 onwards to warm greenhouses to allow the year-round growing of flowers and vegetables, with an area of about 75,000 square meters the greenhouse at Wiesmoor was the largest in Europe at the time.\n\nDuring the Second World War, there was a slave labor camp at Wiesmoor where a large number of civilian prisoners were brought from Poland, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and France, among other countries, to forced labor in the bogs. According to Eugeniusz Popielarz, who was imprisoned there as a young Polish teenager from May 1942 until May 1945 with his mother and three brothers, the older teens and adults dug the peat while the younger pre-teen and teenage boys would push loaded railwagons up an incline on a narrow gauge railway so that they could coast downhill to assemble the train, powered by a peat-fired small locomotive, which would then take the peat to the power plant. In order to make it harder for the boys up the incline, often a German guard or Ukrainian collaborator known as a vorarbeiter would sit atop the already laden railwagon shouting his commands. The living conditions were deplorable in shabby barracks with ill-fitting doors and rotten floorboards through which rats and weasels would make their way into the prisoners living quarters at night, especially in the colder months. The daily ration, according to Eugeniusz, was \"not enough to promote life and too much to permit death.\" Though the camp was basically open, with moderate security to prevent mutiny, there was really no hope for these civilian slave laborers to escape. There was one exception, however, with regards to this camp, namely a section for Soviet POWs. Their misfortune, according to Eugeniusz, was to be fenced-in behind barbed wire and literally starved to the point that they denuded the earth in the corral of grass which they ate, roots and all, seeking sustenance. They were mocked by the German, Ukrainian, and few Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian guards, when they begged for \"a nibble of bread\" - \"кусок хлеба.\" If a slave laborer ever approached out of pity to share his/her ration with these hapless Soviets, they were shot - even for sharing a cigarette. Needless to say, beatings of slave laborers were commonplace to make them work \"more efficiently.\" If a slave took sick and could not work, he/she did not eat. In order to possibly increase their food ration, slaves were permitted to take on extra work as farm laborers for any of the local Bauern (farmers). For example, honey, aspirin, and other items for ill relative internees were obtainable this way from a few kindhearted farm families. Eugeniusz recalled his own illness when honey for a pustule in his throat was obtained in this way. After their additional work on the farms, the slave laborers were expected to observe a curfew and return to their barracks for evening Appel.\n\nBecause of the proximity of Emden, Wilhelmshaven, Oldenburg, and Bremen, Wiesmoor had lain under major air corridors used by the RAF and their Commonwealth allies and others at night, and the USAAF during the day. There were, weather permitting, very frequent nighttime and daylight air raids traversing overhead. At night, the RAF and others (including Poles, Czechs, Norwegians, Dutch, and South Africans) often enough missed their targets with bundled incendiary and fragmentation bombs which inadvertently hit the area around Wiesmoor and embedded themselves in the peat bogs. Eugeniusz remembered that prisoners caught stealing food were condemned to the \"disposal\" of these unexploded bombs (UXBs), all too often with tragic results of which he was a witness from a distance. Other \"violations\" were dealt with by public hangings, or outright shooting of the prisoner by a guard or guards. There were, at least, three Allied plane crashes in the area - a bomber and two fighters which he remembered. One of the downed fighters was a P-51 Mustang of the famed Tuskegee Airmen (\"Red Tails\"). The pilot successfully bailed out and was rescued by one of his squadron-mates who landed to allow his buddy to climb behind him into the cockpit while part of the squadron covered them from above. The camp at Wiesmoor was liberated on the morning of 5 May 1945 by forward units of the 1st Polish Armored Division commanded by Major General Stanisaw Maczek. Two days later, the Division received the surrender of the command of the Kriegsmarine's base at Wilhelmshaven where most of Germany's U-boots were moored.\n\nAfter the second world war, the Ernst Benary flower company erected a further twenty greenhouses and sowed forty hectares of outdoors area. This can be regarded as the start of Wiesmoor as the ‘Flower City’. Around 40,000 people were visiting the town annually by this time and plans were put down to for the building of a baths, an open-air stage and for the extension of the park into a health establishment. In 1951 the boundaries of Wiesmoor were redrawn, several local villages became part of the towns and the area was incorporated into the district of Aurich. With 51.64 square kilometers, Wiesmoor was now the largest town by area in East Frisia, at this time the town had a total of 5,166 inhabitants.\n\n1952 saw the staging of the first flower festival or Blütenfest in German. In that year the peat power plant was employing around 1,200 people and roughly 120,000 tons of peat was being harvested annually. A Further 200 people worked in the greenhouses, whose products, such as tomatoes and cucumber, were exported into neighboring European countries.\n\nThe peat power plant was dismantled 1966 to be replaced with a larger capacity gas turbine power plant. The loss of jobs caused by the closure of the power plant was helped by the growth of local company Bohlen and Doyen who have grown to become easily the largest employer in the city. In 1972 further changes to local boundaries meant that Wiesmoor continued to grow in size and population by incorporating more local villages. In 1977 the town was designated as a Luftkurort, literally an air spa, due to its high air quality.\n\nOn Friday 13 January 1989, a half year after the Ramstein Airshow Disaster, there was a collision of several military jets at low altitude over the Hinrichsfehn area of Wiesmoor. A tornado of the Royal Air Force collided with a squadron of German Alphas Jets of the Jagdbombergeschwader 43 division. One of the German Alpha Jets was seriously damaged but managed to make an emergency landing, the a further Alpha Jet and the Tornado were destroyed, the pilot of the Alpha Jet managed to eject but the two pilots in the Tornado died in the accident. The wreckage from the jets landed near a primary school in South Wiesmoor.\n\nIn 1995 the gas turbine power plant was demolished.\n\nOn the 16th of March 2006, Wiesmoor was granted city status. Lower Saxony Secretary of the Interior, Uwe Schünemann, delivered the documentation personally and congratulated the city on its rapid growth over the last 100 years.\n\nThe flower festival in Wiesmoor was first took place in 1952, the festival is held annually on the first weekend in September (from Thursday to Monday). The festival consist of displays of flowers as well as a parade with floats. Each year at the time of the festival a new Blütenkönigin or Blossom Queen is selected. On the Saturday evening of the festival the old Blütenkönigin parachutes over the sports ground which is the signal to start a party which culminates in a large fireworks display. A new Blütenkönigin is selected on the Sunday afternoon and on Monday the festival concludes with the ‘Kanal in Flammen’ (literally canal in flames) which is a large fireworks display held on and around the Nordgeorgsfehnkanal\n\n\n"}

It runs from Ferrysburg to Nunica in Ottawa County, passing through Spring Lake. The highway serves as a connector between Interstate 96 (I-96) and US Highway 31 (US 31), helping connect Grand Haven with the Grand Rapids metro area. A related Connector 104 runs between the M-104 and US 31 in Ferrysburg. During the 1920s and 1930s, a different highway bore the M-104 designation. The current highway was previously a section of US 16 until 1940 when that designation was shifted to a road going from Nunica to Muskegon; the orphaned highway was redesignated M-104 at the same time. Since then, two routing changes have caused short segments to be transferred to local control and removed from the highway.\n\nThe western terminus of M-104 is at US 31 in Ferrysburg at the north end of the drawbridge spanning the Grand River north of Grand Haven. The highway runs along Savidge Street and crosses a bridge over the channel that connect the river with Spring Lake. On the opposite shore, the trunkline continues along Savidge Street, running between the river to its south and the lake to its north. M-104 crosses the central business area of the village of Spring Lake. East of downtown, the highway transitions to follow Cleveland Street which continues due east to Nunica. The landscape becomes more rural east of Spring Lake where the highway crosses terrain with a mix of open fields and woods. There are various businesses and homes that line the roadway. The eastern terminus of M-104 is located at the exit 9 interchange along I-96 just west of Nunica.\n\nLike other state highways in Michigan, M-104 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on average, 20,663 vehicles used the highway daily in near the western terminus in Ferrysburg and 8,018 vehicles did so each day near the eastern terminus near Nunica, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively. No section of M-104 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.\n\nFrom 1927 until 1939, the first M-104 followed a gravel road from M-47 (now M-52) at Pittsburg, through Laingsburg, to DeWitt, and the current M-104 was originally part of US 16.\n\nIn 1940, a rerouting of US 16 eliminated M-126 between Nunica and Muskegon; the previous routing of US 16 between Nunica and Ferrysburg was redesignated M-104 at this time. This highway designation was truncated on November 25, 1961, after the I-96/US 16 freeway opened, and the section of M-104 between the freeway and the old US 16 routing was transferred to local control. Another short segment of the highway was bypassed when a new bridge was built between Spring Lake and Ferrysburg in 1965.\n\nConnector 104 is an unsigned trunkline in Ferrysburg that runs north along Pine Street and west along 3rd Street to connect exit 104B on US 31 to M-104. According to MDOT, 14,231 vehicles used the trunkline on average each day.\n\n"}

Pollack is involved in the women's spirituality movement.\n\nPollack has written a book-length exposition of Salvador Dali's Tarot deck, comprising a full-page color plate for each card, with her commentary on the facing page. Pollack's work \"78 Degrees of Wisdom\" on Tarot reading is commonly referenced by Tarot readers. She has created her own Tarot deck, Shining Woman Tarot (later Shining Tribe Tarot). She also aided in the creation of the Vertigo Tarot Deck with illustrator Dave McKean and author Neil Gaiman, and she wrote a book to accompany it.\n\nPollack, known for her run of issues 64–87 (1993-1995) on the comic book \"Doom Patrol\", on DC Comics' Vertigo imprint, a continuation of a 1960s comic which had recently became a cult favorite under Grant Morrison. She took over the series in 1993 after meeting editor Tom Peyer at a party, telling him it was the only monthly comic book she would want to write at the time, and sending him a sample script. Towards the end of Morrison's run Pollack began writing monthly \"letters to the editor\" in what she describes as a \"gee-whiz fangirl\" voice asking to take over the book when Morrison was finished. In the final letter she claims that she had already told her mother that she had been given the job. Peyer then used that response to that letter to officially announce that Pollack was, in fact, taking over the book. As a result of these letters being printed in the letter column of Doom Patrol issues some people seem to believe that the letters are the way she actually got the job.\n\nDuring her tenure Pollack dealt with such rarely addressed comic-book topics as menstruation, sexual identity, and transsexuality. Pollack's run ended two years later, with the book's cancellation. \n\nIn addition to \"Doom Patrol\", Pollack has written issues of the \"Vertigo Visions\" anthology featuring Brother Power the Geek (1993) and Tomahawk (1998), the first 11 issues of the fourth volume of \"New Gods\" (1995), and the five issue limited series \"Time Breakers\" (1996) for the short lived Helix imprint.\n\nAuthor Neil Gaiman has sometimes consulted Rachel Pollack on the tarot for his stories. \n\nIn 2019 it was announced that Pollack was reuniting with Doom Patrol artist Richard Case and letterer John Workman to create a short story--titled \"Snake Song\"--for the Kickstarter funded \"music themed horror anthology\" \"Dead Beats\".\n\nThree of Pollack's novels have won or been nominated for major awards in the science fiction and fantasy field: \"Unquenchable Fire\" won the 1989 Arthur C. Clarke Award; \"Godmother Night\" won the 1997 World Fantasy Award, was shortlisted for the James Tiptree, Jr. Award, and was nominated for a Lambda Award; \"Temporary Agency\" was nominated for the 1995 Nebula Award and the Mythopoeic Award, and shortlisted for the Tiptree.\n\nHer magical realism novels explore worlds imbued with elements pulled from a number of traditions, faiths, and religions. Several of her novels are set in an alternative reality that resembles modern America, but an America of Bright Beings, where magic and ritual, religion and thaumaturgy are the norms.\n\nHer book \"The Body Of The Goddess\" is an exploration of the history of the Goddess. Rachel Pollack uses the image of the Goddess in many of her works.\n\nPollack is Jewish, and has frequently written about the Kabbalah, most notably in \"The Kabbalah Tree\".\nPollack is a transsexual woman and has written frequently on transgender issues. In \"Doom Patrol\" she introduced Coagula, a transsexual character. She has also written several essays on transsexualism, attacking the notion that it is a \"sickness,\" instead saying that it is a passion. She has emphasized the revelatory aspects of transsexualism, saying that \"the woman sacrifices her social identity as a male, her personal history, and finally the very shape of her body to a knowledge, a desire, which overpowers all rational understanding and proof.\" \n\n\"A Secret Woman\" features a police detective who is transgender and Jewish. The detective utters the prayer, \"Blessed art thou oh G-d who made me not a woman. Double blessed is Doctor Green who has.\" Rachel Pollack created the characters known as 'the bandage people' for her \"Doom Patrol\" run. The bandage people are 'sexually remaindered spirits' who died in sexual accidents. The initials srs came from the medical term 'sex reassignment surgery'. Rachel wrote the essay \"The Transsexual Book of The Dead\" for the anthology \"Phallus Palace\". This article is concerning trans men.\n\nFairy tales such as the Brothers Grimm have influenced many of Pollack's writings. Her new book, \"Tarot of Perfection\", is a book of fairy tales based on the tarot.\n\nFor nearly 20 years Pollack has been teaching seminars with Tarot author Mary K. Greer at the Omega Institute, in Rhinebeck, New York. She has also done seminars for several years in California in conjunction with Greer, and she co-presented a breakthrough seminar with Tarot author Johanna Gargiulo-Sherman on Tarot and psychic ability, using her own Shining Tribe Tarot and Gargulio-Sherman's Sacred Rose Tarot. Pollack is also a popular lecturer at Tarot seminars and symposiums such as LATS (Los Angeles Tarot Symposium), BATS (Bay Area Tarot Symposium), and the Readers Studio. Pollack currently teaches creative writing at Goddard College. Her most recent work is included in the anthology called \"Interfictions: An Anthology of Interstitial Writing\" edited by Theodora Goss.

Representing Manchester United, he played in the 1956 and 1957 Football League championship-winning teams.\n\nKnown for his pace and agility, Wood had the opportunity to be a professional sprinter, but opted instead to play football. He played for England at international level on three occasions between 1954 and 1956 and, after retiring from playing in 1968, managed football clubs in the US, Cyprus, Greece, Kenya and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nWood started his career as an amateur with Newcastle United, though he failed to make a first team appearance and moved to Darlington in 1949. He only stayed for three months though before joining Manchester United, making his first team debut against Newcastle at Old Trafford in the league on 3 December 1949. Over the next few seasons he gradually displaced the ageing Jack Crompton as United's first choice goalkeeper.\n\nDuring the 1957 FA Cup Final against Aston Villa, Wood was the victim of what was then a perfectly legal shoulder charge. In the sixth minute of the game Wood successfully claimed a cross; however, Villa outside-left Peter McParland clattered into him, breaking Wood's jaw due to him ducking to avoid the challenge. As this game was played in the era before substitutes Jackie Blanchflower was forced to play in goal following the incident, Wood eventually came back on after treatment to play as a forward, United went on to lose the game 2–1. His compensation for this was a Football League First Division title medal to add to the first medal he had gained a year earlier.\n\nIn 1954, when only 23 years old, he was selected to play for the England team.\n\nIn December 1957, United signed Harry Gregg from Doncaster Rovers for £23,500 – the world record fee for a goalkeeper at the time – and Wood found his first-team opportunities limited.\n\nWood was among the survivors of the Munich air disaster on 6 February 1958, suffering minor injuries, but played just one first-team game afterwards and was later sold to Huddersfield Town within a year. He spent seven seasons at Huddersfield, playing more than 250 first-team games, although he was unable to help them win promotion to the First Division. In 1965, he played in the Eastern Canada Professional Soccer League with Toronto Inter-Roma. He then played one season at Bradford City, before finishing his career with two seasons at Barnsley.\n\nSeveral years after leaving Manchester United, Matt Busby unsuccessfully tried to re-sign him for Manchester United when Harry Gregg was injured.\n\nHe continued as a manager in several countries including United States, Ireland, Zambia, Canada, Greece, Kenya, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates. He coached Cyprus and Kenya national football teams. He also coached the NASL team Los Angeles Wolves and the Cypriot team APOEL in 1971–72.\n\nWood married his wife Elizabeth in 1954. They had two daughters, but the couple divorced during the 1970s. He died in July 2002 aged 71 in Bexhill-on-Sea, having returned to England after the end of his coaching career overseas. His death was the result of a heart attack.\n\n"}
{"id": "1887119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887119", "title": "Zimbabwean hip hop", "text": "Zimbabwean hip hop\n\nZimbabwean Hip Hop emerged in the early 1980s and is still present in Zimbabwe in 2017 artists of hip-hop are emerging creating a great impact on youths and also overtaking the zimdancehall.Most artists in Zimbabwe have been motivated by the American hip hop genre called \"TRAP\"due to the epidemic of codeine syrup that is mostly consumed in Chitungwiza (Chitown),Harare and Bulawayo.The Trap music in Zimbabwe is mostly said to be listened by the 20th century and more artist in the country are increasing day by day due to African American influence through Trap music and mumble rap..\n\nDuring this golden era, hip hop emerged as a global voice, spreading like wildfire. It was only a matter of time until it spread to Zimbabwe, where the youth embraced it with open arms. The earliest recordings of hip hop were mostly on vinyl and tape, and were not converted to cd, mp3 or modern media and hence they have become very rare. The most mainstream acts of the time were Piece of Ebony, Fortune Muparutsa, [with rap verses on songs like Rumors (1991)],and Midnight Magic [with songs like Blackness featuring Mau Mau ].Since most vinyl records and cassette tapes are no-longer accessible or in playable condition,Zimbabwe lost a huge chunk of its earlier catalogue, from which, the next generation of artists could draw inspiration from . This also rendered sampling from predecessors virtually non existent. During second half of this 10-year period, beginning on their own and later with the influence of Innocent Tshuma (then known as The Millennium Man), youths across the country would begin to participate in the genre. The instrumentation, form and culture began to lean more towards adopting the globally successful American hip hop trend, leaning less on the stagnant and non evolving local Mbira Hip Hop. Though exported globally by groups like Zimbabwe Legit, Hip hop was and still is in the shadow of other genres like Museve, Reggae, Kwaito, jazz, choral, folk and African House).In 2016 artists like Takura took over the stage and having a number of people following his music but he wasn't the only who was singing hip hop but he was the first to be recognized as he was in a stiff competition with Zimdancehall\n\nSince 2001 a number of artists and businessmen have branched out to form their own brands, record labels and radio stations. This has resulted in most monopolies losing their grip on the industry and diluting their power in distribution,influence,airplay and the ability to predict the next big artist. Artists began selling their own cds in the streets with varying success. Shows such as Mashoko and The Circle done at The Mannernburg in Harare are also measures that have been taken to popularize hip-hop in Zimbabwe. Poets and emcees include Osama, Outspoken, Synik, Upmost, Godobori, Aura, Blackbird (now known as Temple) among others. Some of these poets incite politics in their music and have started a movement known as House Of Hunger.\n\nMashoko later developed from a once a month festival known as Shoko Fest, which included international acts like Hired Gun (USA) and Akala, among others. Many Zimbabwean emcees performed at the show, ongoing since 2010. The same year, Zim Hip Hop Awards began; although controversial, they have survived to the present day.\n\nArtists have recently begun to bypass physical means of distributing their music and have joined digital distribution channels, linked to social media and clout. Music videos and promotional music are now being used to gather followers. Prolific artists are now hiring or being approached by industry managers, to handle their affairs in a more professional manner.\n\nHip hop has grown more and more influential since its inception. Its use of high tech equipment has also ensured that it remains fresh and relevant, being re-birthed with each technological advancement. America has remained at the forefront of the movement with the rest of the world catching up. Zimbabwe, as with most countries, usually mirrors the trending sound in America, and uses it as a benchmark for quality and being up to date. This has seen many acts using the same flow and drum kits used by their favorite rapper and producer.\n\nThere are a few pioneering acts that are now trying to move away from the influence of American hip hop and reinvent themselves by building and branding themselves as kings, nobles and sons of renown. Some have resorted to make remakes and remixes of old records they consider hits, where as some have resorted to sampling traditional or folk songs and making collaborations with bigger and more established names from competing and more successful genres. Acts are also making more use of their traditional languages (Shona and Ndebele), and in-cooperating local instruments such as Mbira, Marimba, Ngoma (traditional drums) or Hosho (traditional shaker).\nColonial-era acts like August Musarurwa and Simon Mashoko have proved that influencing, inspiring or impressing American musicians, is possible as they were sampled or covered for their work by greats like Louis Armstrong and 213 ( snoop dogg, Warren G, Nate Dogg),supporting the argument to incorporate or establish local,unique,distinguishable identities.\n\nRadio has helped the genre a lot, with some hits only existing online, within podcasts such as Radio Kunakirwa, which are now the only proof of their existence. This means that radio catalogues and podcasts are now a vital source of history and library for the genre.Apart from airplay, some radio stations have devoted segments dedicated to the one genre.\n\n\nThere are a few shows dedicated to Hip-Hop on Zimbabwe's local broadcaster.\nFresh hip-hop zw\nhiphopZW\n"}

Hallucinations are usually not intense or impairing and consist of visual snow, trails and after images (Palinopsia), light fractals on flat surfaces, intensified colors or other psychedelic visuals. To be diagnosed, the disorder must cause distress or impairment in work or everyday life. The flashbacks may be continuous or just occasional. Symptoms often get worse when focused on.\n\nAccording to a 2016 review, there are two theorized subtypes of the condition:\n\nThis is where people experience HPPD in the form of random, brief flashbacks.\n\nPeople with this kind of HPPD experience ongoing changes to their vision, which may vary in intensity.\nThe only certain cause for HPPD is prior use of hallucinogens. Some evidence points to phenethylamines carrying a slightly greater risk than lysergamides or tryptamines. There are no known risk factors, and what might trigger any specific disturbing hallucination is not known. Some sort of disinhibition of visual processing may be involved.\n\nHPPD is a DSM-5 diagnosis with diagnostic code 292.89 (F16.983). For the diagnosis to be made, other psychological, psychiatric, or neurological conditions must be ruled out and it must cause distress in everyday life.\nAs of 2020 there is still no good evidence of any specific medicinal treatment as being commonly effective for HPPD. Some reports point to sedatives being helpful and stimulants and cannabis worsening symptoms.\n\nAvoiding any additional use of psychoactive drugs (including cannabis and alcohol) from an early stage of the disorder seems to be most effective way in which most sufferers achieve recovery, as these substances apparently worsen the condition over time. \n\nSome prescription drugs (Lamictal, clonazepam and keppra) have been known to relieve symptoms for some, but worsen symptoms or create dependencies for others. \n\nAntipsychotic drugs and SSRIs have also been reported to help some people but worsen symptoms for others. \n\nSome sufferers have reported benefits from prolonged water fasting, medications like NAC and Lithium, and from supplements like L-Tyrosine, Ashwagandha and lion's mane, although some users report lion's mane and Ashwagandha as having potentially negative effects or creating dependencies. \n\nSunglasses and talk therapy might also help those who are dealing HPPD, but in general it seems that maintaining sobriety from all psychoactive substances is still the best solution available for this condition, as it's been proven to naturally relieve the disorder over time in most sufferers. Doing this as early as possible could be the most important known factor in recovery from HPPD.\n\nThe prevalence of HPPD was unknown as of 2018. Estimates in the 1960s and 1970s were around 1 in 20 for intermittent HPPD among regular users of hallucinogens. It is not clear how common chronic HPPD may be, but one estimate in the 1990s was that 1 in 50,000 regular users might have chronic hallucinations.\n\nIn the second episode of the first season of the 2014 series \"True Detective\" (Seeing Things), primary character Rustin Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) is depicted as having HPPD symptoms such as light tracers as a result of \"neurological damage\" from substance use.\n"}

Their look was from the new wave music scene with black eye paint and spiked hair with a rattail (Borden's bleached blonde and Hellwig's dyed black). The two men would go on to individual success under the ring names of Sting and the Ultimate Warrior, respectively.\n\nSteve Borden and Jim Hellwig originally teamed as part of Powerteam USA, a group of four wrestlers who debuted in 1985 after being trained by Red Bastien and Rick Bassman. In addition to Borden and Hellwig, the group consisted of Garland Donoho and Mark Miller. The team was managed by Bassman as they tried to break into the wrestling business. After only a short time in the business both Donoho and Miller quit due to lack of success and business savvy. \n\nInitially, Hellwig and Borden wrestled as The Freedom Fighters (Justice and Flash, respectively) in Jerry Jarrett's Continental Wrestling Association under manager Dutch Mantel. Because they were essentially bodybuilders and lacked thorough training, the team was raw and brutal, easily hurting opponents with their stiff maneuvers which led to their stay in Memphis being a short one.\n\nThe team began working for Bill Watts' Mid-South Wrestling (renamed the Universal Wrestling Federation shortly after) in early 1986. In Mid-South, they became known as The Blade Runners (Hellwig was called Rock and Borden became Sting). The Blade Runners were managed by \"Hot Stuff\" Eddie Gilbert and as part of \"Hot Stuff International, Inc.\" the team feuded with Ted DiBiase and Steve Williams. In his autobiography \"The Road Warriors: Danger, Death, and the Rush of Wrestling\", Joseph Laurinaitis (aka Road Warrior Animal) stated that Watts was the actual creator of the Blade Runners and that he brought them into Mid-South Wrestling with the intent of presenting them as a parody of The Road Warriors.\n\nLess than six months after arriving in Mid-South, Hellwig and Borden split up with Hellwig moving on to World Class Championship Wrestling, where he became known as The Dingo Warrior, laying the foundation for his famous Ultimate Warrior gimmick in the WWF. Laurinaitis further stated that Hellwig kept the Warrior gimmick to present himself as an offspring of the Road Warriors.\n\nBorden remained in the UWF and under the tutelage of Eddie Gilbert for a while before turning face. As Sting, Borden was among the wrestlers whose contracts were acquired by Jim Crockett Jr. when he bought the UWF in 1987.\n\nThe two men reunited for one match on \"WCW Monday Nitro\" on October 12, 1998, against Hollywood Hogan and Bret Hart of nWo Hollywood. However, the Blade Runners name was not used for this appearance. Sting and Warrior won the match via disqualification due to interference from the nWo.\n"}

He was particularly celebrated for his visually poetic and scenic nature documentaries. His works include \"Pojken i trädet\" (\"The Boy in the Tree\") and the Academy Award-winning \"Människor i Stad\" (\"Symphony of a City\"). \n\nPerhaps Sucksdorff's most widely admired work was the internationally acclaimed \" Det Stora Äventyret (1953)\" (\"The Great Adventure\") about a year in the outdoors told in semidocumentary fashion from the viewpoint of a farmboy. It is noted for its remarkable photography and authentic scenes of nature, and its appeal to children for its story of domesticated otters. Sucksdorff also appeared as an actor in this film, portraying the father, while his real-life son is an actor as well. The film won the International Prize at the 1954 Cannes Film Festival and the Big Silver Medal (Documentaries and Culture Films) at the 4th Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Sucksdorff moved to Rio de Janeiro, where he taught cinema at the film school and continued making documentaries, as well as the documentary-style drama \"Mitt hem är Copacabana\" (\"My Home Is Copacabana\"), which is controversial due to Sucksdorff making up a back story as a street orphan for one of the main actors, a nine year old boy from Ipanema, whose daughter told the real story in a 2019 book.

It was first released in 1919 and stars Conrad Veidt and Reinhold Schünzel. The story was co-written by Richard Oswald and Magnus Hirschfeld, who also had a small part in the film and partially funded the production through his Institute for Sexual Science. The film was intended as a polemic against the then-current laws under Germany's Paragraph 175, which made homosexuality a criminal offense. It is believed to be the first pro-gay film in the world.\n\nThe cinematography was by Max Fassbender, who two years previously had worked on \"Das Bildnis des Dorian Gray\", one of the earliest cinematic treatments of Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\". Director Richard Oswald later became a director of more mainstream films, as did his son Gerd. Veidt became a major film star the year after \"Anders\" was released, in \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\".\n\n\"Anders als die Andern\" is one of the first sympathetic portrayals of homosexuals in cinema. The film's basic plot was used again in the 1961 UK film, \"Victim\", starring Dirk Bogarde. Censorship laws enacted in reaction to films like \"Anders als die Andern\" eventually restricted viewing of this movie to doctors and medical researchers, and prints of the film were among the many \"decadent\" works burned by the Nazis after they came to power in 1933.\n\nVeidt portrays a successful violinist, Paul Körner, who falls in love with one of his male students. A sleazy extortionist threatens to expose Körner as a homosexual. Flashbacks show us how Körner became aware of his orientation and tried first to change it, then to understand it. Körner and the extortionist end up in court, where the judge is sympathetic to the violinist, but when the scandal becomes public, Körner's career is ruined and he is driven to suicide.\n\nThe film opens with Paul Körner (Conrad Veidt), a successful violinist reading the daily newspaper obituaries, which are filled with vaguely worded and seemingly inexplicable suicides. Körner, however, knows that Paragraph 175 is hidden behind them all — that it hangs over German homosexuals \"like the Sword of Damocles.\"\n\nAfter this thesis statement, the main plot begins. Kurt Sivers (Fritz Schulz) is a fan and admirer of Körner and approaches him in hopes of becoming a student of his. Körner agrees, and they begin lessons together, during which they fall for one another.\n\nBoth men experience the disapproval of their parents. Neither are out, but Sivers's parents object to the increasingly large amount of attention he focuses on the violin and his unusual infatuation with Körner, and the Körners do not understand why he has shown no interest in finding a wife and starting a family. Körner sends his parents to see his mentor, the Doctor (Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld).\n\nThe Doctor appears several times in the film, each time to deliver speeches more intended for the audience than the advancement of the plot. In this, his first appearance, he tells Körner's parents:\n\nAfter Körner's coming out, he and Sivers begin seeing each other more openly. While walking together, hand in hand, through the park, they pass a man who recognizes Körner. Later that day, when Körner is alone, this man, Franz Bollek (Reinhold Schünzel) confronts him and demands hush money or else he will expose Sivers.\n\nKörner pays him and keeps it a secret from Sivers that he does so. Eventually, however, the blackmailer's demands become too great and Körner refuses to pay (Bollek reads Körner's reply to his demand in a gay bar). Bollek decides instead to break into Körner's house while he and Sivers are performing, but he is discovered by Sivers and Körner on their return and a fight breaks out. In the course of the fight, Bollek reveals to Sivers that he has been blackmailing him.\n\nSivers runs away and faces hardships trying to survive alone. Körner is left dejected and, over a photo of Sivers, remembers his past.\n\nHis first memory is of boarding school, when he and his boyfriend Max are discovered kissing by their teacher and he is expelled. Next, he remembers University and his solitary and lonely life there, and the growing impossibility of trying to play straight.\n\nHe remembers trying an ex-gay hypnotherapist, but finding him only to be a charlatan. Then he first met the Doctor, whose reaction was much different from those he had previously met. Among other things, he told him:\n\nRemembering further, he recalled first meeting Bollek at a gay dance hall, and Bollek leading him on before ultimately turning on him and using his homosexuality to blackmail him.\n\nBack in the present, Körner takes Else Sivers (Anita Berber), Kurt Sivers' sister, to the Doctor's lecture on alternative sexuality. The Doctor speaks on topics such as homosexuality, lesbianism, gender identity, intersexuality, the perils of stereotypes, and the idea that sexuality is physically determined, rather than a mental condition. Enlightened by the presentation, Else renounces her wish for a relationship with Körner and instead pledges her friendship and support. \n\nKörner reports Bollek for blackmail and has him arrested. In retaliation, Bollek exposes Körner. The Doctor gives testimony on Körner's behalf, but both are found guilty of their respective crimes. Bollek is sentenced to three years for extortion. The judge is sympathetic to Körner, and gives him the minimum sentence allowable: one week.\n\nAllowed to go home before starting his term, Körner finds himself shunned by friends and strangers alike, and no longer employable. Even his family tells him there is only one honorable way out. He then takes a handful of pills, committing suicide.\n\nSivers rushes to his side as he lies dead. Körner's parents blame Sivers for what has happened, but Else harshly rebukes them. Meanwhile, Sivers attempts to kill himself as well, but the Doctor prevents him and delivers his final speech:\n\nThe film closes with an open German law book, turned to Paragraph 175, as a hand holding a brush crosses it out.\n\nThe film premiered in May 1919 and was initially successful at the cinema. Shortly after the premiere, conservative Catholic, Protestant, and right wing anti-semitic groups started to protest and disturb the public screenings. This initiated an extensive public debate on censorship. The constitution of the Weimar Republic initially assured freedom of speech and expression, but special qualifications were created for cinema in response to the \"Different from the Others\" production and screenings. According to these special articles, films which were characterised as obscene or as dangerous to young people were to be censored. Hirschfeld organised screenings of the film for members of Weimar National Assembly, Prussian State Council, Landtag of Prussia, and government officials in Institut für Sexualwissenschaft. This did not yield any results, and in May 1920, specific censorship provisions for films were approved by legislators. The censor office was created in Berlin and its first review was of \"Different from the Others\". The censorship commission consisted of three psychiatrists: Emil Kraepelin, Albert Moll, and Siegfried Placzek, all opponents of Hirschfeld and his advocacy of the legalization of homosexuality. The panel eventually recommended a ban on the public screening of the film, which was put in place in October 1920. The judgement was that the film was biased towards Paragraph 175 and thus presents a one-sided view, confuses young audience about homosexuality, and can be used for the recruitment of underage viewers to become homosexuals. The film was allowed to be shown only in private and to medical professionals. At the end, the only venue where the film was screened for public was Institut für Sexualwissenschaft, where it was shown for education and at special events.\n\nThe film, which co-starred and was co-written by sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld, refers to Hirschfeld's theory of \"sexual intermediacy\". The theory places homosexuality within a broad spectrum comprising heterosexuality, bisexuality, transgenderism, and transvestism (a word invented by Hirschfeld). The film's protagonist first meets his blackmailer at a costume party, and the blackmailer also frequents a drag club; these scenes are the earliest film footage of gay men and lesbians dancing. The film was initially shipped in 40 copies throughout Germany and the Netherlands by Oswald, and it was shown for nearly a year before the authorities stepped in and banned public screenings, allowing it to be shown only to doctors and lawyers. The Nazis destroyed the majority of the prints and only one copy of the film is known to exist.\n\nUCLA Film and Television Archive purchased an original fine-grain master positive of film's footage, which Hirschfeld inserted in his own film “Laws of Love” from the Russian State Film and Photo Archive. \n\nThe film was screened as part of the official program at Outfest in 2012. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Teddy Awards, the film was selected to be shown at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2016. In October 21, 2016, \"Different from the Others\" was screened at NewFest - New York's LGBT Film Festival. The film was also screened in a special event in Jerusalem Cinematheque.\n\n\n\n\n\"Portions of this article originally appeared on the now defunct Outcyclopedia website.\"\n"}

The name \"AARON\" does not seem to be an acronym; rather, it was a name chosen to start with the letter \"A\" so that the names of successive programs could follow it alphabetically. However, Cohen did not create any other major programs.\n\nInitial versions of AARON created abstract drawings that grew more complex through the 1970s. More representational imagery was added in the 1980s; first rocks, then plants, then people. In the 1990s more representational figures set in interior scenes were added, along with color. AARON returned to more abstract imagery, this time in color, in the early 2000s.\n\nCohen used machines that allowed AARON to produce physical artwork. The first machines drew in black and white using a succession of custom-built \"turtle\" and flatbed plotter devices. Cohen would sometimes color these images by hand in fabric dye (Procion), or scale them up to make larger paintings and murals. In the 1990s Cohen built a series of digital painting machines to output AARON's images in ink and fabric dye. His later work used a large-scale inkjet printer on canvas.\n\nDevelopment of AARON began in the C programming language then switched to Lisp in the early 1990s. Cohen credits Lisp with helping him solve the challenges he faced in adding color capabilities to AARON.\n\nAn article about Cohen appeared in \"Computer Answers\" that describes AARON and shows two line drawings that were exhibited at the Tate gallery. The article goes on to describe the workings of AARON, then running on a DEC VAX 750 minicomputer.\n\nRaymond Kurzweil's company has produced a downloadable screensaver of AARON for Microsoft Windows PCs. This version of AARON can also produce printable images. AARON's source code is not publicly available, but Cohen has described AARON's operations in various essays and it is discussed in abstract in Pamela McCorduck's book.\n\nAARON cannot learn new styles or imagery on its own; each new capability must be hand-coded by Cohen. It is capable of producing a practically infinite supply of distinct images in its own style. Examples of these images have been exhibited in galleries worldwide. AARON's artwork has been used as an artistic equivalent of the Turing test. It does seem however that AARON's output follows a noticeable formula (figures standing next to a potted plant, framed within a colored square is a common theme).\n\nCohen is very careful not to claim that AARON is creative. But he does ask \"If what AARON is making is not art, what is it exactly, and in what ways, other than its origin, does it differ from the 'real thing?' If it is not thinking, what exactly is it doing?\" — The further exploits of AARON, Painter. However, it could be argued that AARON is simply following procedural instructions and that the real artist behind each piece is AARON's creator, Cohen. Adding further weight to this argument is AARON's seemingly narrow 'library' of human form variations, poses and scene compositions and the requirement of hard coding to add new 'styles'.\n\n"}

The parish covers an area of .\n\nThe fen edge north of Cambridge was well populated in Roman times, and the village's situation on a Roman road will have helped its growth. The road, Akeman Street, which once joined Ely to London, passes close to the village from north to south. Car Dyke, the Roman drainage canal known locally as the Tilling, also runs through the village and in medieval times marked the boundary between the marshes of Landbeach and neighbouring Waterbeach. Drainage of the parish was not completed until the 18th century, and for much of the year large areas of the parish were inundated.\n\nThe village was listed as \"Utbech\" (\"out bec\") in the Domesday Book and in the 13th and 14th centuries was occasionally referred to as \"Inbech\" (\"in bec\"). The original meaning of the \"beach\" part of the names is not universally agreed. One theory invokes the Anglo Saxon word \"bec\" meaning \"stream\", but a more plausible one gives the meaning as \"shore\", much like the modern \"beach\", as both Waterbeach and Landbeach were at the edge of The Fens, then an area of marshland.\n\nPopulation reached a peak of 526 in 1851 but fell to 389 in 1911. It passed 600 for the first time in the 1950s and 800 in the 1990s.\n\nThe village has three archaeological sites with remains of mediaeval manor houses, which together form a Scheduled Ancient Monument.\n\nThe parish church of All Saints comprises a chancel with north chapel, a nave with south porch, and a three-stage west tower with a slim octagonal spire. The majority of the present building was constructed in the 14th century, though there are some remains of the 13th-century building at the base of the tower and chancel. The church retains much of its medieval woodwork. The spire was rebuilt in 1972.\n\nLandbeach Tithe Barn was constructed in the sixteenth century, or possibly earlier, for the collection and storage of tithes paid by the villagers to the church. It is thatched, timber framed and weatherboarded, and is a grade II listed building. In 2016 the tithe barn was taken over by a charitable trust, which in 2019–20 renovated and rethatched the building. The tithe barn is used for village events.\n\nLandbeach has two churches (Anglican and Baptist), a village hall and an Indian restaurant (formerly The Slap Up public house). The nearest railway station is Waterbeach, on the Fen Line. The village lies close to the A10 road that links Cambridge to King's Lynn.\n\nThere were up to seven public houses in the village in the 19th century, of which none remain. These included The Black Bull which opened in the mid-18th century. The Black Bull, The Bower and The British Queen are now private houses and The Red Cow remains only in that a part of its tiled floor can be seen in the garden of one of the houses in the High Street. There is no remaining trace of The Windmill, The Coach and Horses, The Queen Adelaide or The Bricklayers Arms. By the 1960s only The Slap-Up, which opened in around 1860 on the Cambridge to Ely turnpike (now the A10) remained, but this is now a restaurant.\n\nWithin the parish boundary, but outside the residential area, is Cambridge Research Park, on the site of the former Landbeach Marina, itself a flooded former gravel pit.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1887185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887185", "title": "Mike Todd", "text": "Mike Todd\n\nMichael Todd (born Avrom Hirsch Goldbogen, June 22, 1909 – March 22, 1958) was an American theater and film producer, best known for his 1956 production of \"Around the World in 80 Days\", which won an Academy Award for Best Picture. He is known as the third of Elizabeth Taylor's seven husbands, and is the only one whom she did not divorce (he died in a private plane accident a year after their marriage). He was the driving force behind the development of the eponymous Todd-AO widescreen film format.\n\nTodd was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Chaim Goldbogen (an Orthodox rabbi), and Sophia Hellerman, both of whom were Polish Jewish immigrants. He was one of nine children in a poor family, the youngest son, and his siblings nicknamed him \"Tod\" (pronounced \"Toat\" in German) to mimic his difficulty pronouncing the word \"coat.\" It was from this that his name was derived.\n\nThe family later moved to Chicago, arriving on the day World War I ended. Todd was expelled in the sixth grade for running a game of craps inside the school. In high school, he produced the school play, \"The Mikado\", which was considered a hit. (As Mike Todd, he would produce a jazz version of the musical on Broadway in 1939.)\n\nHe eventually dropped out of high school, and worked at a variety of jobs, including shoe salesman and store window decorator. One of his first jobs was as a soda jerk. When the drugstore went out of business, Todd had acquired enough medical knowledge from his work there to be hired at Chicago's Michael Reese Hospital as a type of \"security guard\" to stop visitors from bringing in food that was not on the patient's diet.\n\nTodd began his career in the construction business, where he made, and subsequently lost, a fortune. He opened the College of Bricklaying of America, buying the materials to teach bricklaying on credit. The school was forced to close when the Bricklayers' Union did not view the college as an accepted place of study. Todd and his brother, Frank, next opened their own construction company.\n\nHis first flirtation with the film industry was when he served as a contractor to Hollywood studios, soundproofing production stages during the transition from silent pictures to sound. The company he owned with his brother went bankrupt when its financial backing failed in the early days of the Great Depression. Not yet 21, Todd had lost over $1 million (equivalent to about $ in today's funds). Todd married the former Bertha Freshman on February 14, 1927, and was the father of an infant son with no home for his family. Todd's subsequent business career was volatile, and failed ventures left him bankrupt many times.\n\nDuring the 1933–1934 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago, Todd produced an attraction called the \"Flame Dance\". In this number, gas jets were designed to burn part of a dancer's costume, leaving her naked in appearance. The act attracted enough attention to bring an offer from the Casino de Paree nightclub in New York City. Todd got his first taste of Broadway with the engagement and was determined to find a way to work there.\n\nAfter seeing the Federal Theatre Project's Chicago run of \"The Swing Mikado\", an adaptation of the Gilbert and Sullivan opera \"The Mikado\" with an all African-American cast conceived by Harry Minturn, Todd decided to do his own version on Broadway, \"The Hot Mikado\", despite protests by the FTP. \"The Hot Mikado\", starring Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, opened on Broadway March 23, 1939. The subsequent success of Todd's production, at the expense of the Chicago production, contributed to the financial crisis and ultimate demise of the Federal Theatre Project unit in Chicago.\n\nTodd's Broadway success gave him the nerve to challenge showman Billy Rose. Todd visited Grover Whalen, president of the 1939 New York World's Fair, with a proposal to bring the Broadway show to the Fair. Whalen, eager to have the show at the fair, covered Todd's Broadway early closing costs. Rose, who had an exclusivity clause in his fair contract, met Todd at Lindy's, where Rose learned his contract covered new forms of entertainment only. To avoid any head-to-head competition, Rose quickly agreed to promote Todd's production along with his own.\n\nTodd ultimately produced 17 Broadway shows during his career, including the immensely successful burlesque revue \"Star and Garter\" starring comedian Bobby Clark, \"The Naked Genius\" written by and starring stripper Gypsy Rose Lee, and a 1945 production of \"Hamlet\" starring Maurice Evans. His greatest successes were in musical comedy revues, typically featuring actresses in deshabillé, such as \"As the Girls Go\" (which also starred Clark) and \"Michael Todd's Peepshow\".\n\nTodd floated the idea of holding the 1945 Major League Baseball All-Star Game in newly liberated Berlin. Although baseball's new commissioner Happy Chandler was reportedly \"intrigued\" by the idea, it was ultimately dismissed as impractical. The game was finally cancelled due to wartime travel restrictions.\n\nIn 1952, Todd made a production of the Johann Strauss II operetta \"A Night in Venice\", complete with floating gondolas at the then-newly constructed Jones Beach Theatre in Long Island, New York. It ran for two seasons.\n\nIn 1950, Mike Todd formed Cinerama with the broadcaster Lowell Thomas (who founded Capital Cities Communications) and the inventor Fred Waller. The company was created to exploit Cinerama, a widescreen film process created by Waller that used three film projectors to create a giant composite image on a curved screen. The first Cinerama feature, \"This is Cinerama\", was released in September 1952.\n\nBefore its release, Todd left the Cinerama Company to develop a widescreen process which would eliminate some of Cinerama's flaws. The result was the Todd-AO process, designed by the American Optical Company. The process was first used commercially for the successful film adaptation of \"Oklahoma!\" (1955). (Ironically, the producer had famously dismissed the stage musical during tryouts a decade earlier, quipping “No jokes, no legs, no chance.”) Todd soon produced the film for which he is best remembered, \"Michael Todd's Around the World in 80 Days\", which debuted in cinemas on October 17, 1956. Costing $6 million to produce (equivalent to approximately $), the movie earned $16 million at the box office. In 1957, \"Around the World in 80 Days\" won the Best Picture Academy Award.\n\nIn the 1950s Todd acquired the Harris and Selwyn Theaters in downtown Chicago. The Selwyn was renamed Michael Todd's Cinestage and converted into a showcase for Todd-AO productions, while the Harris was renamed the Michael Todd Theatre and operated as a conventional cinema. The facades of both theaters survive as part of the Goodman Theatre complex, although the interiors have been demolished.\n\nA William Woolfolk novel from the early 1960s, entitled \"My Name Is Morgan\", was considered to be loosely based on Todd's life and career.\n\nAt age 17, Todd married Bertha Freshman in Crown Point, Indiana, on Valentine's Day 1927. He had been interested in Freshman since age 14, but needed to develop confidence before even asking her out. In 1929, the couple's son, Mike Todd, Jr., was born. The death of his father in 1931 was a turning point for Todd; he decided to change his name to Mike Todd on the day of his father's death. Todd's wife, Bertha, died of a pneumothorax (collapsed lung) on August 12, 1946, in Santa Monica, California, while undergoing surgery at St. John's Hospital for a damaged tendon in her finger. Todd and his wife were separated at the time of her death; less than a week before Freshman's death, he had filed for divorce.\n\nOn July 5, 1947, Todd married actress Joan Blondell. They divorced on June 8, 1950, after Blondell filed for divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty.\n\nTodd's third marriage was to the actress Elizabeth Taylor, with whom he had a tempestuous relationship. The couple exchanged vows on February 2, 1957, in Mexico, in a ceremony performed by the mayor of Acapulco. It was the third marriage for both the 24-year-old bride and her 47-year-old groom. Mario Moreno, better known as Cantinflas, was their witness. Todd and Taylor had a daughter, Elizabeth Frances (Liza) Todd, born on August 6, 1957.\n\nOn March 22, 1958, Todd's private plane \"the Liz\" crashed near Grants, New Mexico. The plane, a twin-engine Lockheed Lodestar, suffered engine failure, while being flown overloaded in icing conditions at an altitude that was too high for only one engine working under the heavy load. The plane went out of control and crashed, killing all four on board. Five days before the crash, Todd flew on this plane to Albuquerque, east of the crash site, to promote a screening of \"Michael Todd's Around the World in 80 Days\".\n\nIn addition to Todd, those who died in the crash were screenwriter and author Art Cohn, who was writing Todd's biography \"The Nine Lives of Michael Todd\", pilot Bill Verner, and co-pilot Tom Barclay, a replacement for the plane's regular co-pilot. Verner was a veteran military pilot who had flown heavily loaded Curtiss C-46 Commando cargo planes over The Hump between India and China. Todd paid for the installation of two extra fuel tanks in his leased Lodestar aircraft; this made the aircraft weigh more than its official rating when all the tanks were full, without the flight crew, passengers or luggage aboard. Verner had flown the plane overloaded like this before without incident, including piloting Todd on trips over the Atlantic and around Europe. The tanks had been filled to capacity prior to the fatal flight.\n\nTodd was on his way to New York to accept the New York Friars Club \"Showman of the Year\" award. Taylor wanted to travel with her husband, but stayed home with a cold after Todd overruled her pleas to join the trip. Just hours before the crash, Todd described the plane as safe as he phoned friends, including Joseph Mankiewicz and Kirk Douglas, in an attempt to recruit a gin rummy player for the flight: \"Ah, c'mon,\" he said. \"It's a good, safe plane. I wouldn't let it crash. I'm taking along a picture of Elizabeth, and I wouldn't let anything happen to her.\"\n\nHis son, Mike Jr., wanted his father's body to be cremated after it was identified through dental records and brought to Albuquerque, New Mexico, but Taylor refused, saying he would not want cremation. Todd's mother, aged 91 and a sanitarium patient at the time of her son's death, was not told of the accident as it was felt that the shock would be detrimental to her fragile health. Todd was buried in Forest Park, Illinois, at Beth Aaron Cemetery in plot 66, which is part of Jewish Waldheim Cemetery. In his autobiography, Eddie Fisher, who considered himself to be Todd's best friend, stated:\n\nThere was a closed coffin, but I knew it was more for show than anything else. The plane had exploded on impact, and whatever remains were found couldn't be identified... The only items recovered from the wreckage were Mike's wedding ring and a pair of platinum cuff links I'd given him.\nIn June 1977, Todd's remains were desecrated by graverobbers. The thieves broke into his casket looking for a $100,000 diamond ring, which, according to rumor, Taylor had placed on her husband's finger prior to his burial. The bag containing Todd's remains was found under a tree near his burial plot. The bag and casket had been sealed in Albuquerque after Todd's remains were identified following the 1958 crash. Todd's remains were once more identified through dental records and were reburied in a secret location.\n\n\n!colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#C1D8FF;\"| Husband of Elizabeth Taylor\n\n!colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#C1D8FF;\"| Producer of Academy Award for Best Picture \n"}

It was privately built by an investor group led by Bill Pereira and General Manager, Fred Kuenzi. The natural grass playing field at Memorial Stadium is aligned northeast, at an approximate elevation of above sea level.\n\nAfter moving from the Tri-Cities after the 1986 season, the renamed Boise Hawks continued as an independent in the Northwest League and played their first two seasons at Bill Wigle Field on the campus of Borah High School. They moved to Memorial Stadium in 1989 and became an affiliate of the California Angels organization in 1990.

It is the only known member of the genus Eurypharynx and the family Eurypharyngidae. It belongs to the \"saccopharyngiforms\", members of which were historically placed in their own order, but are now considered true eels in the order Anguilliformes. The pelican eel has been described by many synonyms, yet nobody has been able to demonstrate that more than one species of pelican eel exists. It is also referred to as the gulper eel (which can also refer to members of the related genus \"Saccopharynx\"), pelican gulper, and umbrella-mouth gulper. The specific epithet \"pelecanoides\" refers to the pelican, as the fish's large mouth is reminiscent of that of the pelican. \n\nPelican eel specimens can be hard to describe, as they are so fragile that they become damaged when recovered from the immense pressure of the deep sea. The pelican eel's most notable feature is its large mouth, which is much larger than its body. The mouth is loosely hinged, and can be opened wide enough to swallow a fish much larger than the eel itself. The pouch-like lower jaw resembles that of a pelican, hence its name. The lower jaw is hinged at the base of the head, with no body mass behind it, making the head look disproportionately large. Its jaw is so large that it is estimated to be about a quarter of the total length of the eel itself. When it feeds on prey, water that is ingested is expelled via the gills.\n\nPelican eels are black or olive and some subspecies may have a thin lateral white stripe. They are ray-finned fish, and only resemble eels in appearance.\n\nThe pelican eel is very different in appearance from typical eels. It lacks pelvic fins, swim bladders, and scales. Its muscle segments have a “V-shape”, while other fish have “W-shaped” muscle segments. The pelican eel has an aglomerular kidney that is thought to have a role in maintaining the gelatinous substance filling the \"lymphatic spaces\" that are found around the vertebrae. It has been hypothesized that these gelatinous substance filled \"lymphatic spaces\" could function in a similar way to a swim bladder. Unlike many other deep sea creatures, it has very small eyes. It is believed that the eyes evolved to detect faint traces of light rather than form images. The pelican eel also has a very long, whip-like tail. Specimens that have been brought to the surface in fishing nets have been known to have their long tails tied into several knots.\n\nThe pelican eel uses a whip-like tail for movement. The end of the tail bears a complex organ with numerous tentacles, which glows pink and gives off occasional bright-red flashes. The colors on its tail are displayed through its light-emitting photophores. This is presumably a lure to attract prey, although its presence at the far end of the body from the mouth suggests the eel may have to adopt an unusual posture to use it effectively. Pelican eels are also unusual that the ampullae of the lateral line system projects from the body, rather than being contained in a narrow groove; this may increase its sensitivity.\n\nThe pelican eel grows to about in length. Another interesting fact is that the pelican eel does not appear to display sexual dimorphism.\n\nThe stomach can stretch and expand to accommodate large meals, although analysis of stomach contents suggests they primarily eat small crustaceans. Despite the great size of the jaws, which occupy about a quarter of the animal's total length, it has only tiny teeth, which would not be consistent with a regular diet of large fish.\nThe large mouth may be an adaptation to allow the eel to eat a wider variety of prey when food is scarce. It can also be used like a large net. The eel can swim into large groups of shrimp or other crustaceans with its mouth closed, opening wide as it closely approaches prey, scooping them up to be swallowed. The pelican eel is also known to feed on cephalopods (squid) and other small invertebrates. When the eel gulps its prey into its massive jaws, it also takes in a large amount of water, which is then slowly expelled through its gill slits. Pelican eels themselves are preyed upon by lancetfish and other deep sea predators. Recent studies have showed that pelican eels are active participants in their pursuit of food, rather than passively waiting for prey to fall into their large mouths. The pelican eel is not known to undergo vertical diurnal migration like other eels.\n\nNot much is known about the reproductive habits of the pelican eel. Similar to other eels, when pelican eels are first born, they start in the leptocephalus stage, meaning that they are extremely thin and transparent. Until they reach their juvenile stage, they interestingly have very small body organs and do not contain any red blood cells. As they mature, the males undergo a change that causes enlargement of the olfactory organs, responsible for the sense of smell, and degeneration of the teeth and jaws. The females, on the other hand, remain relatively unchanged as they mature. The large olfactory organs in the males indicates that they may locate their mates through pheromones released by the females. Many researchers believe that the eels die shortly after reproduction.\n\nThe pelican eel has been found in the temperate and tropical areas of all oceans. In the North Atlantic, it seems to have a range in depth from . One Canadian-arctic specimen was found in Davis Strait at a depth of 1,136-1,154 meters, and also across the coasts of Greenland. More recently, pelican eels have been spotted off the coast of Portugal, as well as near Hawaiian islands.\n\nBecause of the extreme depths at which it lives, most of what is known about the pelican eel comes from specimens that are inadvertently caught in deep sea fishing nets. Although once regarded as a purely deep-sea species, since 1970, hundreds of specimens have been caught by fishermen, mostly in the Atlantic Ocean. In October of 2018, the first direct observation of a gulper eel was made by a group of researchers about 1500 kilometers off the coast of Portugal near the islands called the Azores. The team witnessed the aggressive nature of the eel's hunting process, as it was constantly moving around in the water column to attempt to find prey. In September of 2018, the E/V \"Nautilus\" team also witnessed a juvenile gulper eel inflating its mouth in attempt to catch prey in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument (PMNM). Until these recent explorations, not much has been analyzed by researchers of the behavior of gulper eels.\n\nIn 2003, researchers from the University of Tokyo sequenced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from specimens of Eurypharynx pelicanoides and Saccopharynx lavenbergi. After comparing the sequences from the specimens with other known sequences, they found that Eurypharynx pelicanoides and Saccopharynx lavenbergi were closely related and genetically distinct from anguilliformes.\n\n\n"}

It was a worldwide hit and became their signature song. Since its release, it has been remixed and covered by many artists, including Cabin Crew and Sunset Strippers.\n\n\"Waiting for a Star to Fall\" was written by Shannon Rubicam and George Merrill, and was inspired by an actual falling star that Rubicam had seen during a Whitney Houston concert at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles. The duo did not initially consider recording the song themselves, instead submitting it to Houston's manager Clive Davis, in the hope that he would decide to use it on her next album. Even though Rubicam and Merrill had written Houston's previous hits \"How Will I Know\" and \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\", Davis rejected \"Waiting for a Star to Fall\", suggesting that it did not suit her. The song was then offered to and recorded by Belinda Carlisle for her 1987 release \"Heaven on Earth\", at the insistence of her label, but Carlisle disliked it and refused to include it on the album. This version has, however, circulated on an unofficial compilation of that album's outtakes.\n\nThe tenor saxophone solo on the Boy Meets Girl version was provided in a session recording early in the career of Andy Snitzer, who later found success as a solo artist.\n\nMerrill and Rubicam decided to record the song themselves for their second album \"Reel Life.\" Released as a single on June 10, 1988, it became a hit in the United States, slowly climbing the charts and eventually reaching number one on the Billboard Adult Contemporary Chart and number five on the Billboard Hot 100.

It peaked at number 76 in the UK.\n\nThe video game \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" included the song in the playlist for the in-game radio station Vice City FM.\n\nJohnny Loftus of AllMusic remarked that the song was \"just classic\", and that \"the urgency as it drives toward its chorus is a clinic for durable songwriting.\"\n\nThe video for the song, directed by Australian director Claudia Castle, features scenes of Merrill and Rubicam singing it on a beach and inside a house. Also featured are scenes of a group of children playing with bubbles, including the couple's young daughter Hilary.\n\n\nThe song has been covered and remixed several times. The most commercially successful versions came in 2005, when Australian musical group Cabin Crew remixed the song as \"Star to Fall\" (or \"Star2Fall\") but were refused the sampling of the original lyrics by Sony BMG. Liking what Cabin Crew had done, however, George Merrill agreed to re-record the vocals. Cabin Crew's version peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart in March 2005.

{"id": "1887212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887212", "title": "Stein's example", "text": "Stein's example\n\nStein's example (or phenomenon or paradox), in decision theory and estimation theory, is the phenomenon that when three or more parameters are estimated simultaneously, there exist combined estimators more accurate on average (that is, having lower expected mean squared error) than any method that handles the parameters separately. It is named after Charles Stein of Stanford University, who discovered the phenomenon in 1955.\n\nAn intuitive explanation is that optimizing for the mean-squared error of a \"combined\" estimator is not the same as optimizing for the errors of separate estimators of the individual parameters. In practical terms, if the combined error is in fact of interest, then a combined estimator should be used, even if the underlying parameters are independent. If one is instead interested in estimating an individual parameter, then using a combined estimator does not help and is in fact worse.\n\nThe following is perhaps the simplest form of the paradox, the special case in which the number of observations is equal to the number of parameters to be estimated. Let θ be a vector consisting of \"n\" ≥ 3 unknown parameters. To estimate these parameters, a single measurement \"X\" is performed for each parameter \"θ\", resulting in a vector X of length \"n\". Suppose the measurements are known to be independent, Gaussian random variables, with mean θ and variance 1, i.e.,\n\nThus, each parameter is estimated using a single noisy measurement, and each measurement is equally inaccurate.\n\nUnder these conditions, it is intuitive and common to use each measurement as an estimate of its corresponding parameter. This so-called \"ordinary\" decision rule can be written as\n\nThe quality of such an estimator is measured by its risk function. A commonly used risk function is the mean squared error, defined as\n\nSurprisingly, it turns out that the \"ordinary\" estimator proposed above is suboptimal in terms of mean squared error when \"n\" ≥ 3. In other words, in the setting discussed here, there exist alternative estimators which \"always\" achieve lower mean squared error, no matter what the value of formula_4 is.\n\nFor a given \"θ\" one could obviously define a perfect \"estimator\" which is always just \"θ\", but this estimator would be bad for other values of \"θ\". The estimators of Stein's paradox are, for a given \"θ\", better than \"X\" for some values of \"X\" but necessarily worse for others (except perhaps for one particular \"θ\" vector, for which the new estimate is always better than \"X\"). It is only on average that they are better.\n\nMore accurately, an estimator formula_5 is said to dominate another estimator formula_6 if, for all values of formula_4, the risk of formula_5 is lower than, or equal to, the risk of formula_6, \"and\" if the inequality is strict for some formula_4. An estimator is said to be admissible if no other estimator dominates it, otherwise it is \"inadmissible\". Thus, Stein's example can be simply stated as follows: \"The ordinary decision rule for estimating the mean of a multivariate Gaussian distribution is inadmissible under mean squared error risk.\"\n\nMany simple, practical estimators achieve better performance than the ordinary estimator. The best-known example is the James–Stein estimator, which works by starting at \"X\" and moving towards a particular point (such as the origin) by an amount inversely proportional to the distance of \"X\" from that point.\n\nFor a sketch of the proof of this result, see Proof of Stein's example. An alternative proof is due to Larry Brown: he proved that the ordinary estimator for a \"n\"-dimensional multivariate normal mean vector is admissible if and only if the \"n\"-dimensional Brownian motion is recurrent. Since the Brownian motion is not recurrent for \"n\" ≥ 3, the ordinary estimator is not admissible for \"n\" ≥ 3.\n\nStein's example is surprising, since the \"ordinary\" decision rule is intuitive and commonly used. In fact, numerous methods for estimator construction, including maximum likelihood estimation, best linear unbiased estimation, least squares estimation and optimal equivariant estimation, all result in the \"ordinary\" estimator. Yet, as discussed above, this estimator is suboptimal.\n\nTo demonstrate the unintuitive nature of Stein's example, consider the following real-world example. Suppose we are to estimate three unrelated parameters, such as the US wheat yield for 1993, the number of spectators at the Wimbledon tennis tournament in 2001, and the weight of a randomly chosen candy bar from the supermarket. Suppose we have independent Gaussian measurements of each of these quantities. Stein's example now tells us that we can get a better estimate (on average) for the vector of three parameters by simultaneously using the three unrelated measurements.\n\nAt first sight it appears that somehow we get a better estimator for US wheat yield by measuring some other unrelated statistics such as the number of spectators at Wimbledon and the weight of a candy bar. This is of course absurd; we have not obtained a better estimator for US wheat yield by itself, but we have produced an estimator for the vector of the means of all three random variables, which has a reduced \"total\" risk. This occurs because the cost of a bad estimate in one component of the vector is compensated by a better estimate in another component. Also, a specific set of the three estimated mean values obtained with the new estimator will not necessarily be better than the ordinary set (the measured values). It is only on average that the new estimator is better.\n\nFor any particular value of θ the new estimator will improve at least one of the individual mean square errors formula_11 This is not hard − for instance, if formula_12 is between −1 and 1, and σ = 1, then an estimator that moves formula_13 towards 0 by 0.5 (or sets it to zero if its absolute value was less than 0.5) will have a lower mean square error than formula_13 itself. But there are other values of formula_12 for which this estimator is worse than formula_13 itself. The trick of the Stein estimator, and others that yield the Stein paradox, is that they adjust the shift in such a way that there is always (for any θ vector) at least one formula_17 whose mean square error is improved, and its improvement more than compensates for any degradation in mean square error that might occur for another formula_18. The trouble is that, without knowing θ, you don't know which of the \"n\" mean square errors are improved, so you can't use the Stein estimator only for those parameters.\n\nAn example of the above setting occurs in channel estimation in telecommunications, for instance, because different factors affect overall channel performance. \n\n\n"}

He joined the army and attended a Spanish military academy. He was commissioned as an engineer, distinguishing himself on various expeditions. He spent the next thirteen years of his life in the military and rose to the rank of Brigadier General in the Spanish Army.\n\nIn 1777, Spain and Portugal signed the Treaty of San Ildefonso. As dictated by the treaty, each nation would send a delegation to the Río de la Plata region to negotiate the border dispute between the Portuguese and Spanish colonies. Azara was selected as a member of this delegation, departing quickly for the New World. The Portuguese delegation, however, never arrived, and Azara ended up remaining in the region from 1781 to 1801. To pass the time, he decided to create an accurate map of the region. On these expeditions, Azara began observing the nature of the region. Over the course of his time there, he \"described 448 birds...This number is reduced to 381 when duplications of sex, age, and plumage are taken into account (eight remain unidentified), and 178 of them are the types upon which the scientific names are based.” He also identified 78 quadrupeds, 43 of which were new. A number of animals were named after him, including Azara's night monkey (\"Aotus azarae\"), Azara's agouti (\"Dasyprocta azarae\"), Azara's grass mouse (\"Akodon azarae\"), Azara's spinetail (\"Synallaxis azarae\"), and Azara's tree iguana (\"Liolaemus azarai\" ). Dorsum Azara on the Moon is also named after him. Before leaving South America, he sent his brother José Nicolás de Azara (then Spanish Ambassador at Paris) his zoological notes and observations, which Moreau de Saint-Méry published at Paris in 1801 under the title of \"Essai sur l'histoire naturelle des quadrupèdes du Paraguay\". In 1802 there appeared at Madrid the essay \"Apuntamientos para la Historia natural de los cuadrúpedos del Paraguay y Río de la Plata\".\n\nUpon his return to Europe in 1801, he traveled to Paris to meet his brother. There, he published \"Voyage dans l'Amerique meridionale depuis 1781 jusqu'en 1801\" (1809), which included his observations on many topics ranging from the geography of the region to characteristics of the many indigenous groups in the region. Following the death of his brother, Azara returned to Spain and held a variety of minor government positions. He died of pneumonia on October 20, 1821, and was buried in his family's vault in the town of his birth.\n\nHis works were well received though not without criticism. Azara had largely written his works to correct what he considered to be many errors in \"Histoire naturelle\" by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. Intellectuals praised him for his thoroughness and accuracy. Charles Darwin had a high regard for Azara's work (despite the latter not being a professional naturalist), and in several of his books spoke approvingly of Azara's authority. Some, however, thought that his work was too harsh a critique of Buffon.\n\n\n\n"}

On record with Springsteen, most of Suki Lahav's parts did not make it to released form, but she sang the choir-like vocals on \"4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)\" from the album \"The Wild, The Innocent and The E Street Shuffle\" and played violin on \"Jungleland\" from the \"Born to Run\" album. In concert, Lahav's violin were a focal point of slow songs during Springsteen's shows of this time, and her \"pale\" \"willowy\" presence on stage contrasted with Springsteen's.\n\nDuring their time in the US, a daughter, Tal was born. She was killed in a road accident at the age of three and a half. They returned to Israel in the spring of 1975.\n\nThe couple divorced in 1977. Lahav, now known by her Hebrew name Tzruya (or sometimes transliterated as Tsruya), established a family with Moshe Albalek in Jerusalem. By 1985, she had two children and little involvement in the music industry. Then she began working as a violinist and violist, appearing with the Israeli Kibbutz Orchestra, and as an actress.\n\nShe became a successful lyricist, writing for prominent musicians and singers in Israel; \"Shara Barkhovot\" (\"Singing in the Streets\"), the Israeli entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1990 performed by Rita, featured her words, and some of her songs are considered icons of Israeli music. She also recast existing song lyrics from other languages into Hebrew, such as the Leonard Cohen song \"Famous Blue Raincoat\" in 1993. In 1999, she wrote the lyrics for the multi-ethnic collaborative, Glykeria's recording \"Tfilat Ha'imahot\" (\"The Mothers' Prayer\"), which also featured Amal Murkus and Yehudit Tamir. In 2003, the album \"No Longer the Sea: A Collection Of Tzruya Lahav's Songs\" was released, featuring performances by Rita, Yehudit Ravitz, Meir Banai, Yehuda Poliker, and others. Her songs have also been performed by Israeli artists Gidi Gov, Rami Kleinstein, and Ricky Gal. In 2004, a show of her songs was produced in Tel Aviv.\n\nLahav authored screenplays, including the 1996 Israeli crime film \"Kesher Dam\", and two novels: \"Andre’s Wooden Clogs\" (Kinneret, 2002), based on the true-life story of a boy's survival of The Holocaust in the Netherlands (in Hebrew, also translated to Dutch, Italian ), and \"The Swamp Queen Does The Tango\" (Am Oved, 2004), an adult fairy tale (in Hebrew). Both books won numerous awards and prizes for literature, including the Yad Vashem Prize and the Minister of Culture's prize for first work. She also teaches creative writing in Jerusalem, where she lives in the German Colony neighborhood.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1887234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887234", "title": "SPARS code", "text": "SPARS code\n\nThe SPARS code is a three-position alphabetic classification system developed in the early 1980s by the Society of Professional Audio Recording Services (SPARS) for commercial compact disc releases to denote aspects of the sound recording and reproduction process, distinguishing between the use of analog equipment and digital equipment. The code's three positions refer to recording, mixing, and mastering respectively. The first two positions may be coded either \"A\" for analog or \"D\" for digital; the third position (mastering) is always \"D\" on digital CDs. The scheme was not originally intended to be limited to use on digital packaged media: it was also available for use in conjunction with analog releases such as vinyl or cassette (where the final character of course would always be \"A\"), but this was never done in practice.\n\nThe system was first implemented in 1984. Due to increasing complexity of recording and mixing processes developed over the code's first decade of use, SPARS decided to withdraw endorsement of the code in 1991 because they felt the code was overly simplistic and did not accurately reflect the complexity of typical recording and mixing processes in use at the time. However, many record labels continued to use the code and SPARS decided to re-endorse the SPARS code in 1995.\n\nThe three letters of the code have the following meanings:\n\nThere are five types:\n\nSince CD is a digital medium, it must be produced from a digital master—therefore the last letter of the code will always be D. Newer LPs stored the music in analog format, yet they were often labeled as DDD, as the recording and mixing/editing were both digital.\n\nAs digital tape recorders only became widely available in the late 1970s, almost all recordings prior to this date that appear on CD will be AAD or ADD—having been digitally remastered. This means that the original analog master tape has been converted (transcribed) to digital. It does not always imply that there has been any additional editing or mixing, although this may have taken place.\n\nIn practice, AAD was uncommon and DAD was very rare, as many companies (especially the well-known classical music labels) used digital tape recorders (which was not prohibitively more expensive than analog tape recorders) during the editing or mixing stage.\n\nThe jewel box booklet and/or inlay of early compact discs included the SPARS code, typically DDD, ADD, or AAD. The typeface Combi Symbols CD includes the two common ways that the code was written on recordings.\n\nChris Stone and other members of the Society of Professional Audio Recording Services (SPARS) proposed the code with a set of guidelines for CD manufacturers to mark their product with an indication of exactly which parts of the recording process were analog and which were digital.\n\nThe SPARS code was first introduced on commercial CD releases by PolyGram in 1984.\n\nSPARS withdrew endorsement of the code in 1991 due to confusion over analog and digital conversions and interfaces; many felt the SPARS code oversimplified and meaningless. However, many labels continued to use it, and in 1995, the organization re-endorsed the code.\n\nThe main limitation of the code is that it only covers the type of tape recorder used, not taking into account other equipment used in the production of the recording. For example, during the mixing stage (the middle letter in the code) many DDD recordings may have actually been converted from digital to analog, mixed on an analog mixing console, but converted back to digital and digitally recorded, thus earning it a D in the relevant part of the code. In addition to this, many recordings have effects or parts of different recordings added on to them, creating more confusion for the code.\n\nRegardless of the quality of the recording, many DDD classical music compact discs typically sold for considerably more than their ADD counterparts of the same work, due to the so-called premium attached to the fledgling digital recording technology. For instance, Herbert von Karajan's and Berliner Philharmoniker's rendition of Beethoven's Symphony No. 3, an analogue recording from 1977 that won the Grand Prix du Disque, sold for considerably less than their 1984 digital recording of the same piece, though the newer recording was not particularly critically acclaimed.\n\nThese albums with common SPARS codes (AAD, ADD, DDD) are arranged by year of release on CD, where known:\nMany older recordings previously issued on vinyl were reissued on CD, beginning with the format's commercial introduction in late 1982 (see Digital recording for a timeline). Reissue CDs often only have the original LP's copyright dates on them, so it's not obvious when the CDs were actually made. If they bear a SPARS code, though, the manufacture date was no earlier than 1984. Most of these older recordings were analog, so it's not unusual to see AAD and ADD codes, but occasional examples of digital-recording codes appear on later CD editions, such as these:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1887241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887241", "title": "Pseudomyxoma peritonei", "text": "Pseudomyxoma peritonei\n\nPseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a clinical condition caused by cancerous cells (mucinous adenocarcinoma) that produce abundant mucin or gelatinous ascites. The tumors cause fibrosis of tissues and impede digestion or organ function, and if left untreated, the tumors and mucin they produce will fill the abdominal cavity. This will result in compression of organs and will destroy the function of colon, small intestine, stomach, or other organs. Prognosis with treatment in many cases is optimistic, but the disease is lethal if untreated, with death by cachexia, bowel obstruction, or other types of complications.\n\nThis disease is most commonly caused by an appendiceal primary cancer (cancer of the appendix); mucinous tumors of the ovary have also been implicated, although in most cases ovarian involvement is favored to be a metastasis from an appendiceal or other gastrointestinal source. Disease is typically classified as low- or high-grade (with signet ring cells). When disease presents with low-grade histologic features the cancer rarely spreads through the lymphatic system or through the bloodstream.\n\nSigns and symptoms of pseudomyxoma peritonei may include abdominal or pelvic pain and/or bloating, distension, digestive disorders, weight changes, increased girth, and infertility.\n\nThe primary tumor appears to arise from the MUC2 expressing goblet cells and most commonly from these cells in the appendix. The K-Ras and p53 genes may be involved in the oncogenesis. It may be diagnosed with a range of conditions. While the majority of these cases are associated with appendiceal carcinomas, other conditions may also be found, including disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis (DPAM), peritoneal carcinomas, several mucinous tumors (mucinous adenocarcinoma, mucinous cystadenoma, and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma), as well as other disease states. Other primary sites that have been reported include colon, rectum, stomach, gallbladder, bile ducts, small intestine, urinary bladder, lung, breast, fallopian tubes, and the pancreas.\n\nThis disease is often discovered during surgery for other conditions, e.g., hernia repair, following which an experienced pathologist can confirm the diagnosis. Advanced stages may present as tumors palpable on the abdomen or distention of the belly (\"jelly belly\" is sometimes used as a slang term for the condition). Due to the rarity of this disease, it is important to obtain an accurate diagnosis so that appropriate treatment may be obtained from a surgical oncologist who specializes in appendix cancer. Diagnostic tests may include CT scans, examination of tissue samples obtained through laparoscopy, and the evaluation of tumor markers. In most cases a colonoscopy is unsuitable as a diagnostic tool because in most cases appendix cancer invades the abdominal cavity but not the colon (however, spread inside the colon is occasionally reported). PET scans may be used to evaluate high-grade mucinous adenocarcinoma, but this test is not reliable for detecting low-grade tumors because those do not take up the dye which shows up on scans. New MRI procedures are being developed for disease monitoring, but standard MRIs are not typically used as a diagnostic tool. Diagnosis is confirmed through pathology.\nThere is substantial debate regarding histopathologic classification of pseudomyxoma peritonei. In 1995, Ronnett et al. proposed separating pseudomyxoma peritonei cases into two diagnostic categories: adenoma (disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis, DPAM) or carcinoma (peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis, PMCA) with a third category reserved for cases with intermediate features. In this classification system, cases of DPAM were characterized by peritoneal lesions composed of abundant extracellular mucin containing scant simple to focally proliferative mucinous epithelium with little cytologic atypia or mitotic activity (in other words, most cells looked fairly normal and there was no evidence of mitosis which would indicate that cells were rapidly dividing), with or without an associated appendiceal mucinous adenoma. Cases of PMCA were characterized by peritoneal lesions composed of more abundant mucinous epithelium with the architectural and cytologic features of carcinoma (irregular cells, evidence that cells were rapidly dividing, and other criteria), with or without an associated primary mucinous adenocarcinoma. Bradley et al. (2007) argued that continued use of non-malignant terms, i.e., adenoma, for those frequent cases with low-grade features (such as DPAM), is misleading because pseudomyxoma peritonei is a disease state that results from invasion of the abdominal cavity by cells with uncontrolled growth. Bradley states that an adenoma, by definition, is a tumor confined to the appendiceal mucosa with absolutely no evidence of invasion beyond the muscularis mucosae.\n\nThe term mucinous adenocarcinoma is used in different contexts depending on the reference material used by the pathologist for disease classification. For example, neoplasms characterized by high-grade features, invasive glands and or signet ring cells, are termed adenocarcinoma in pathology literature. However, some pathologists (e.g., Odze and Goldblum, \"Surgical Pathology of the GI Tract, Liver, Biliary Tract and Pancreas\", 2nd ed.) also use the term mucinous adenocarcinoma when referring to low-grade, well-differentiated tumors lacking high-grade features. Low-grade mucinous adenocarcinoma is used by the American Joint Committee on Cancer and World Health Organization and is nearly or completely synonymous with the DPAM designation. For low-grade mucinous adenocarcinoma, disease may be designated as \"benign\" because tumors do not invade deeply into tissue and rarely metastasize to parenchyma of organs; this designation may be misleading and confusing to the layperson because pseudomyxoma peritonei is not a harmless condition, fatal if untreated. High-grade or poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma has a generally poorer prognosis, though surgical treatment with heated intra-peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is yielding promising outcomes (see surgical treatment).\n\nTreatment is variable, both due to its rarity and to its frequently slow-growing nature. Treatment ranges from watchful waiting to debulking and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC, also called intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy, IPHC) with cytoreductive surgery.\n\nThe standard of care for mucinous adenocarcinoma with clinical condition PMP involves cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), by surgical oncologists who specialize in treating PMP. Some surgeons also apply early post-operative intraperitonial chemotherapy (EPIC), adjunct to surgical cytoreduction and HIPEC. In situations where surgery is not required immediately, patients can be monitored via CT scans, tumor marker laboratory tests, and physical symptoms, to determine when, and if, surgery is warranted. Although some surgical procedures may be rather extensive, patients can and do recover from surgery, and the majority of these patients can and do live productive lives.\n\nIn debulking, the surgeon attempts to remove as much tumor as possible. CRS or cytoreductive surgery involves surgical removal of the peritoneum and any adjacent organs which appear to have tumor seeding. Since the mucus tends to pool at the bottom of the abdominal cavity, it is common to remove the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and parts of the large intestine. Depending upon the spread of the tumor, other organs might be removed, including but not limited to the gallbladder, spleen, and portions of the small intestine and/or stomach. For organs that cannot be removed safely (like the liver), the surgeon strips off the tumor from the surface.\n\nChemotherapy (typically the agent Mitomycin C) may be infused directly into the abdominal cavity after cytoreductive surgery to kill remaining microscopic cancerous tumors and free floating cells. The heated chemotherapy (HIPEC) is perfused throughout the abdominal cavity for an hour or two as the last step in the surgery, or ports are installed to allow circulation and/or drainage of the chemicals for one to five days after surgery, known as early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (EPIC). EPIC may be given in multiple cycles for several months after surgery.\n\nSystemic chemotherapy may be administered as additional or adjuvant treatment. Due to the increased availability of new chemotherapies developed for colon and colorectal cancer patients, some patients have experienced stability in tumor growth with systemic chemotherapy. Systemic chemotherapy is reserved for patients with advanced disease, recurrent disease, or disease that has spread to the lymph nodes or distant sites.\n\nThis disease may recur following surgery and chemotherapy. Periodic post operative CT scans and tumor marker laboratory tests are used to monitor the disease for any tumor regrowth.\n\nThe overall incidence is 0.5 to 1 cases per 100,000 people per year. It is slightly more common in women than men (male:female ratio = 9:11). The median age at presentation is typically about 50 years with a range of 20–25 years.\n\nThe first case was described by Carl F. Rokitansky in 1842. Werth in 1884 coined the term pseudomyxoma peritonei, describing it in association with a mucinous ovarian tumor. In 1901 Frankel described the first case associated with a cyst of the appendix.\n\n\n"}

Prior to July 1658 he resided for a time in Northumberland County, Virginia, where he had purchased . He married Ann Marwood on January 4, 1658, and shortly thereafter moved to Nansemond County, Virginia, where he lived for about two years.\n\nDurant was associated with Nathaniel Batts, a fur trader, and Richard Batts, a sea captain, and together with them explored the Albemarle Sound area of Virginia.\n\nOn August 4, 1661, Durant purchased, in the second oldest recorded deed of the area, land from Cisketando, king of the Yeopim Indian tribe. On March 13, 1662, a second purchase was made from Kilcocanen, another Yeopim. By 1662 Durant was living in Virginia on property adjacent to the Albemarle Sound, which became part of the Carolina colony in 1665. His plantation, called \"Wicocombe\" (subsequently known as \"Durant's Neck\"), was located in Perquimans County, North Carolina. The exact location of his home is unknown, but the present town of Durant, on the peninsula between the Perquimans River and the Little River, lies on the neck of land five miles east of Edenton, that was sold to George Durant by the two Indian leaders.\n\nA mariner turned planter, Durant was one of the ablest and most influential men in the county and a leader of the 1677 Culpeper's Rebellion, an uprising over the requirement that all colonial goods be transported in British ships.

Taking place on a set of island archipiélagos where the wolf Badler and his legion of mouse-like Chews are threatening to pollute the locations through industries and machinery, players assume the role of the titular main protagonist in an attempt to overthrow Badler and his BB Brigade army with the help of his companions Nash and Kelly. Its gameplay mainly consists of platforming using a main three-button configuration.\n\n\"Punky Skunk\" was conceived by Ukiyotei founder Kenshi Naruse during his time working at the company, who began creating a mascot action game intended for younger audiences reminiscent of Sony's \"Skyblazer\" on the Super Famicom as a commission by Bullet-Proof Software but later settled on doing a new title directed towards western audience with Visit using the same game engine after Bullet-Proof Software changed their direction. The arrival of PlayStation in both eastern and western markets led Ukiyotei with suspending development of the project on Super Famicom before ultimately deciding on making a different version for the former platform, while integrating some of their previously established ideas from the original version into the final release.\n\nUpon its release, \"Punky Skunk\" was met with a mostly negative reception, with critics panning its visual presentation, audio and gameplay.\n\n\"Punky Skunk\" is a side-scrolling action-platform game similar to \"Skyblazer\" where the player takes the role of an anthropomorphic skunk named Punky, who settles on saving the world with the aid of his friends Nash and Kelly from the evil BB Brigade army led by Badler as the main objective. \n\nThroughout the stages, players may find a set of special tools for Punky via a \"gear\" icon, including a skunk spray, a parasail, a pogo stick, inline skates, digging claws and a snowboard. Besides the main stages in the game, minigames are also featured which can benefit Punky in his journey with items like extra lives. \n\nSimilar to \"Super Mario Bros.\" and \"Sonic the Hedgehog\", there are collectible stars scattered on almost every stage and obtaining 100 of them grants Punky with an extra life. Punky loses a live if he sustains a number of hits or falls of the stage and once all lives are lost, the game is over. Progress in the game is saved via the PlayStation's memory card.\n\n\"Punky Skunk\" was the creation of Ukiyotei founder Kenshi Naruse, whose previous works at the company included \"Hook\", \"Skyblazer\" and \"\". Kenshi recounted about the game's development process and history in a 2012 online interview. Kenshi stated that the title went through various circumstances before its eventual release to market, initially starring a different main protagonist on a mascot action game titled \"Metamoru Kid Gūmin\" for the Super Famicom as a commission by Bullet-Proof Software, who wanted a game intended for younger audiences while Ukiyotei settled on creating a concept reminiscent of \"Skyblazer\" but aimed at kids. Despite work on \"Metamoru Kid Gūmin\" being nearly complete, development was later halted due to Bullet-Proof Software changing their direction.\n\nUkiyotei started afterwards negotiations with Japanese publisher Visit, who proposed to the team with reusing the same game engine written for \"Metamoru Kid Gūmin\" on a new project but the arrival of PlayStation in Japanese markets led Ukiyotei focusing towards the western market of the Super Famicom instead. Kenshi claimed that Punky's design and main method of attack were a product of Visit, who told the team that \"this incorporated the opinions of North American buyers\". Although work on the Super Famicom version of \"Punky Skunk\" was nearly completed, the launch of the PlayStation in North America and the subsequent decrease in the 16-bit market for Super Famicom titles resulted in suspending its development.\n\nUkiyotei would later propose Visit in resuing Punky and continue development of \"Punky Skunk\" on PlayStation, to which the latter agreed at the request of elements such as the visuals matched the system's capabilities. The programming team used Punky as research in order to code previous techniques they were able to perform with Super Famicom on PlayStation such as character animation and parallax scrolling, as software development kits for the latter console were deemed to be not suitable for 2D titles, converting several elements from the former version while finishing level design and other aspects during the process.\n\n\"Punky Skunk\" was created by most of the same team that previously worked on \"Skyblazer\" for the Super Famicom at Ukiyotei. Development was helmed by Kaori and Kenshi Naruse acting as directors, with Kenshi also being its sole game designer. Artists Midori Nasu, Michiyo Komura, Rika Ueno, Sadaki Matsumoto, Tadashi Aoyama and Teruo Nagato were responsible for the character designs and pixel art respectively. Norihiro Tokeshi, Satoshi Kuroda, Tadakatsu Makiuchi, Takeru Yamada and Yasushi Kamiya acted as programmers. Former Capcom composers Harumi and Yasuaki Fujita co-wrote the soundtrack. Visit also collaborated on the project's making as well.\n\n\"Punky Skunk\" was first showcased to the public in a playable state on Super Famicom under its Japanese title, \"Cooly Skunk\", at the 1995 Famimaga Earth World show, where an actor in a Punky costume appeared. The game was later previewed in gaming magazine such as \"Famitsu\", touting its launch with a 23 February 1996 release date. \n\nThe original Super Famicom version of \"Punky Skunk\" was never released due to dying 16-bit markets and the launch of PlayStation in North America. Prior to its cancellation on Super Famicom, a playable demo was broadcast via Satellaview. In 2019, the demo was discovered on a 8M Memory Pak at the Japanese video game store Super Potato and a ROM image of said demo was later leaked online on January 2020.\n\n\"Punky Skunk\" was later moved and eventually published on PlayStation by Visit in Japan on 1 November 1996 under the name \"Cooly Skunk\", and later in North America by Jaleco on February 1998. On December 2, 1999, the game was later re-released as budget title exclusively in Japan.\n\n\"Punky Skunk\" was met with mostly negative reviews from critics since its release. \"Next Generation\" reviewed the game, rating it one star out of five, and stated that \"Nuts to this - you might as well hook up your SNES and play \"Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel\"\". \n\n\"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" criticized the game's marketing for claiming the titular character had attitude, stating Punky was \"...a Generation X skunk with an attitude!\". The titular character is ranked eighth on \"Game Informer\"’s list of \"the top 10 worst character names\". Ryan Geddes of \"IGN\" considered the game and its English title to be equally bad. \"Screen Rant\"s Evan Hopkins placed its titular character as number 14 in his \"20 video game mascots that tried to dethrone Mario\" feature.\n\n"}

It is situated about 3 miles (4.8 km) off the southwest corner of the island of Martha's Vineyard.\n\nThe island was used by the United States Navy as a practice bombing range from 1943 to 1996. In 1998, the Navy transferred the island to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for use as an unstaffed wildlife refuge. Due to safety risks from unexploded ordnance and its value as a wildlife habitat, the island is closed to all public use.\n\nIn 1602, during the British ship \"Concord\"s exploration of Cape Cod, Captain Bartholomew Gosnold named Nomans Land \"Martha's Vineyard\" after his eldest daughter, Martha. However, the name was later transferred to the larger island currently known as Martha's Vineyard, which is located northeast of Nomans Land.\n\nThe island was probably named \"Nomans Land\" after a Martha's Vineyard Wampanoag sachem, Tequenoman, who had jurisdiction over the island when the English came in the early 17th century: named from \"\"Teque\"Noman's Land\" (figurative phrase).\n\nAn entail of 1695 mentions that William Nicoll of Islip Grange, Long Island, New York, owned the Island of Normans Land near \"Martins Vineyard\" recalling the fact that on December 19, 1685, Governor Dongan, Lord of the Manor of Martha's Vineyard (including Normans Land) had made Nicoll his Steward there.\n\nAn airfield was constructed by the U.S. Navy on the southern edge of the island between November 1942 and May 1944, and the island was used, beginning in World War II, as Nomans Land Range for 53 years (1943–1996). In 1952, the island was sold by the Crane family to the Navy. The airfield was abandoned by the Navy sometime between 1945 and 1954, though usage as a bombing range continued until 1996.\nThe eastern third of the island has been managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service since 1975. Following an effort to clear the island of ordnance in 1997 and 1998, the rest of the island was transferred to the Fish and Wildlife Service for use as a wildlife refuge, primarily for migratory birds.\n\nA stone covered in runes mentioning the Viking explorer Leif Erikson, believed to be the first European to set foot in North America, was reportedly discovered in 1926 and photographed near the coast the island. While this suggests that Vikings might have travelled as far south as present-day Massachusetts, and that it is the true location of the settlement of Vinland, archaeologists have considered it a hoax.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 19, 1999. In the episode, mafia boss Fat Tony successfully extorts a large sum of money from Springfield Elementary School, forcing Principal Skinner to close it down. However, a toy company called Kid First Industries, led by Jim Hope, later buys the school and privatizes it. Classes now start focusing on toys and marketing only, and soon a new toy called Funzo that resembles the children's ideas is released by Kid First Industries in time for the Christmas shopping season. Bart and Lisa decide to destroy all Funzos in Springfield but Gary Coleman, Kid First Industries' security guard, tries to intercept them.\n\n\"Grift of the Magi\", which satirizes the commercialization of Christmas, was written by Tom Martin and directed by Matthew Nastuk. The episode features several guest appearances; Tim Robbins as Jim Hope, Gary Coleman as himself, Joe Mantegna as Fat Tony, and Clarence Clemons as a narrator that tells the viewers at the end of the episode how the story ends.\n\nAround 7.76 million American homes tuned in to watch the episode during its original airing. It was first released on DVD in 2003 in a collection of five Christmas-related \"Simpsons\" episodes, titled \"Christmas With the Simpsons\". \n\nCritics have given \"Grift of the Magi\" generally mixed to negative reviews, particularly because of its plot. The episode has, however, been praised for some of its gags and Coleman's appearance.\n\nBart and Milhouse have to remain inside The Simpsons house when an ozone hole moves over Springfield. The two dress up as ladies and jump on the bed, singing \"Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves\". When Homer comes in abruptly, Bart falls off of the bed and lands on one of Homer's bowling balls and breaks his coccyx. Dr. Hibbert informs Homer and Marge that Bart will have to use a wheelchair until the bone has healed. When Bart arrives at Springfield Elementary School the following day, he finds that he cannot enter because the school lacks ramps for the disabled. As Principal Skinner considers a ramp for the school, mafia boss Fat Tony emerges and suggests that his construction company would be a good choice of company to build it. Although the new ramp system almost immediately collapses (due to it being made out of bread sticks), Fat Tony informs Skinner that the construction supposedly cost US$200,000 and that the school will still have to pay. In response, Principal Skinner decides to close Springfield Elementary due to lack of funds (having used them to pay off Fat Tony and thus avoid brutal mob reprisals).\n\nAll pleas for financial help are in vain, including a private school play performed in front of Mr. Burns at his mansion, until Jim Hope, the president of a company named Kid First Industries, buys the school and privatizes it. The school's staff is replaced, and classes now focus on toys and marketing. Lisa soon discovers that the company that bought Springfield Elementary is a toy company, using students for research to make a new popular toy in time for the Christmas shopping season. She is then frightened by the appearance of a robotic figure. When Bart and Lisa are back at home, watching television, they see an advertisement for a toy named Funzo. It has many features suggested by Springfield Elementary students during a brainstorming session at the school. They visit Jim Hope's office to complain, and he apologetically gives them a free Funzo toy. Bart and Lisa later discover that Funzo is programmed to destroy other toys.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, with Homer's help, the two steal all the Funzo toys from underneath every Christmas tree in Springfield with the intention of burning them in the town's long-running tire fire. However, Gary Coleman, who is a security guard at Kid First Industries, comes to stop them. The two parties argue all night until the next morning when they settle down into civilized discussion about the commercialization of Christmas. Coleman changes his opinion about the toy company and helps the Simpsons destroy the remaining functioning Funzo toys that were not destroyed in the tire fire. Afterwards, Homer invites Coleman to Christmas dinner at the Simpson family's house, where Mr. Burns shows up after deciding to donate money to Springfield Elementary following an epiphany he had that night and Moe joined in after being renounced from committing suicide via visions of what life would have been like without him.\n\n\"Grift of the Magi\" was written by Tom Martin and directed by Matthew Nastuk as part of the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\" (1999–2000). It was the first episode that Martin wrote on his own, having previously co-written the season ten episode \"Sunday, Cruddy Sunday\" with George Meyer, Brian Scully, and \"The Simpsons\" showrunner Mike Scully. Martin got the inspiration for \"Grift of the Magi\" after reading a magazine article about how major companies were receiving permission to advertise their products in school students' textbooks. He thought it \"seemed like a gigantic conflict that could lead to big problems\", and therefore believed an episode based on it would be a good idea. According to DVD Talk reviewer Adam Tyner, the episode is a satire of the commercialization of Christmas. A writer for \"Newsday\" has commented that episode skewers \"the annual craze for that one 'hot' toy.\" This has also been pointed out by Mike Scully, who said in 2008 that \"Grift of the Magi\" was produced around the time when \"every year there seemed to be a hot toy. Like the Furbies, or whatever – some toy that kids just had to have that year.\" In response to Scully's comment, Martin added that every year \"the media would create this gigantic rush at the toy store for various things. This [episode] was coming on the heels of, yeah, the Furby.\"\n\nGuest stars in the episode include Tim Robbins as Jim Hope, Gary Coleman as himself, Joe Mantegna as Fat Tony, and Clarence Clemons as a narrator. Scully thought Robbins \"did a great job\" because the \"Simpsons\" staff wanted the character of Jim Hope to be \"fun and upbeat and somebody the kids would love.\" Clemons narrates a few scenes at the end of the episode, telling the viewers how the story ends. When Coleman agrees to spend Christmas with the Simpsons, Clemons says, for example: \"And Gary Coleman was as good as his word, and as for old Mr. Burns, he was visited by three ghosts during the night and agreed to fund the school with some money he found in his tuxedo pants.\" Shortly after Coleman's death in 2010, an article appeared in the newspaper \"El Comercio\" that noted that \"the nod to the harsh reality of Gary Coleman in [the episode] is given: in real life a few years ago Gary had to make a living as a shop security guard.\"\n\n\"Grift of the Magi\" originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 19, 1999. It was viewed in approximately 7.76 million households that night. With a Nielsen rating of 7.7, the episode finished 39th in the ratings for the week of December 13–19, 1999 (tied with an episode of the American Broadcasting Company (ABC)'s \"20/20\"). It was the second highest-rated broadcast on Fox that week, following an episode of \"Ally McBeal\" (which received a 9.9 rating). On October 14, 2003, \"Grift of the Magi\" was released in the United States on a DVD collection titled \"Christmas With the Simpsons\", along with the season one episode \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\", the season four episode \"Mr. Plow\", the season nine episode \"Miracle on Evergreen Terrace\", and the season thirteen episode \"She of Little Faith\". On October 7, 2008, the episode was released on DVD again as part of the box set \"The Simpsons – The Complete Eleventh Season\". Staff members Martin, Scully, Meyer, Matt Groening, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Matt Selman, Tim Long, and Lance Kramer participated in the DVD audio commentary for \"Grift of the Magi\". Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set.\n\nSince airing, \"Grift of the Magi\" has received generally mixed to negative reception from critics. While reviewing the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\", DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that the episode \"feels like an amalgamation of elements from prior holiday programs and never really elicits much humor. Christmas is commercialized and corporations use and abuse their customers? Those aren’t exactly rich insights, so ['Grift of the Magi'] comes across as a below average episode.\" In his review of the DVD \"Christmas With the Simpsons\", Digitally Obsessed critic Joel Cunningham wrote that the episode \"comes from Season 11, well past the point when the series had sacrificed character for absurdist humor. Unless you don't think evil toy marketers, sentient Furbys, and Gary Coleman qualify. Anyway, after the school nearly goes bankrupt, Principal Skinner signs a contract with corporate backers who use the kids to conduct market research. There are some good gags, but the story doesn't hang together very well.\" Adam Tyner of DVD Talk argued that the episode \"has a couple of good gags (Gary Coleman chatting on the phone being my favorite) but is quickly forgettable\". Brian James of PopMatters described Coleman's cameo as \"hysterical\" in 2004, and Meghan Lewit of the same website listed \"Grift of the Magi\" at number eight on her 2009 list of the \"10 best holiday themed TV episodes.\"\n\n"}

Charles Lynch's extralegal actions were legitimized by the Virginia General Assembly in 1782.\n\nIn 1811, Captain William Lynch claimed that the phrase \"Lynch's Law,\" already famous, actually came from a 1780 compact signed by him and his neighbours in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, to uphold their own brand of law independent of legal authority.

{"id": "1887287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887287", "title": "Józef Retinger", "text": "Józef Retinger\n\nJózef Hieronim Retinger (Kraków, 17 April 1888 12 June 1960, London; World War II noms de guerre \"Salamandra\", \"Salamander\", and \"Brzoza\", \"Birch Tree\") was a Polish scholar, international political activist with access to some of the leading power brokers of the 20th century, a publicist and writer.\n\nAlready as a gifted student in Paris and London he mixed with the leading lights of music and literature. Most notably, he became a friend of compatriot Joseph Conrad. During World War I, the young Retinger became politically active in Austria-Hungary and Russia on behalf of the Polish independence movement. Following a failed attempt to broker peace between Austria-Hungary and the Allies of World War I, he had to retreat to Central America, where he became an economic adviser.\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War II, he was principal adviser to the Polish government-in-exile. Early in 1944, a daring mission into Occupied Poland by parachute, with the help of British intelligence, added to his air of mystery and subsequent controversy. A Freemason with a reputation as a grey eminence, after World War II he went on to cofound the European Movement, which led to the establishment of the European Union, and was instrumental in forming the secretive Bilderberg Group. In 1958, he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nJózef Retinger was born in Kraków, Poland (then part of Austria-Hungary), the youngest of five children: his father had a daughter, Aniela, from a first marriage to Helena Jawornicka. His mother was Maria Krystyna Czyrniańska, daughter of a Greek Catholic Lemko professor of chemistry at the Jagiellonian University. His father, Józef Stanisław Retinger, was the personal legal counsel and successful adviser to French-born Count Władysław Zamoyski. Retinger's great-grandfather, Filip Rettinger, was a Jewish tailor from Tarnów who with his family converted to Catholicism in 1827. When his lawyer grandson died, Count Zamoyski took the promising youngster, Józef, into his household and paid for him to attend the Bartłomiej Nowodworski High School in Kraków. Retinger's eldest brother, Emil, became a commander in the Polish Navy, while his son, , was stationed in the United Kingdom during World War II (1943–45), as a member then leader of Squadron 308 of the Polish Air Force. Retinger's brother, Juliusz, taught physiological chemistry at the University of Chicago and University of Wilno. Retinger himself initially considered a career in the priesthood, but three months in the Jesuit novitiate in Rome confirmed he would not be suited to the life.\n\nFurther financed by Count Zamoyski in 1906, Retinger entered simultaneously the Ecole des sciences politiques and the Sorbonne in Paris and two years later, aged twenty, became the youngest person ever to earn a Ph.D. in literature from there. While in the French capital, armed with introductions from Zamoyski and his own relative, the salonnière and pianist Misia Sert, he moved in intellectual circles and was befriended by among others, André Gide, François Mauriac, , Jean Giraudoux, Erik Satie and Maurice Ravel. His early literary ambitions were stopped in their tracks when he presented his first novel, \"\"Les Souffleurs\"\" to André Gide for his opinion. Gide told him: \"Joseph, you will never be a writer.\"\n\nHe next went to Munich to study comparative psychology for a year. From there, encouraged by Zamoyski, in 1910 he moved to England, where he entered the London School of Economics for a year's study and began a lobbying operation on behalf of the Polish cause and its populations scattered across three ailing empires. Formally he became Director of the London Office of the Polish National Committee (1912–1914). During this time he continued to move in élite circles and thanks to an introduction by Arnold Bennett whom he had met in Paris, Retinger developed a close friendship with his older Polish compatriot, the already well established novelist, Joseph Conrad. Retinger urged Conrad to visit Poland, and on 28 July 1914, the day World War I broke out, Retinger, his wife Otolia, and Conrad, his wife, and their two sons arrived in Kraków, the two men's childhood stamping grounds (they were alumni of the same secondary school). Due to the closeness of the Russian border (Russia was then allied to Great Britain), the Conrads soon sought greater safety in the Tatra Mountains resort of Zakopane. Retinger would write about Conrad in his 1943 book, \"Conrad and His Contemporaries\". Historian Norman Davies suggests that it was probably Conrad who introduced the \"polyglot and polymath\" Retinger to the British intelligence services. Later Retinger became a personal friend of Major-General Sir Colin Gubbins, wartime head of SOE, and after the war an MI6 \"asset\".\n\nWith the clouds of war closing in, the project of writing a play together with Conrad based on the latter's novel, \"Nostromo\" had to be abandoned as both men hurriedly left Austria Hungary. Retinger would have been eligible for military call up in Galicia, but no mention of this is made by his biographers. Instead, he put aside literary endeavours and once more assumed the role of a political lobbyist for Poland, publishing pamphlets and travelling between London, Paris and New York, aided by Conrad in London. In the first years of the war, this was not on the agenda of the major powers. Retinger looked instead for other potential alliances and political leverage which led to meetings with leading Zionists of the time, including Chaim Weizmann, Vladimir Zhabotinski and Nahum Sokolow who were seeking international recognition and rights for the Jewish diaspora. In 1916 guided by Zamoyski and with the approval of Herbert Asquith, David Lloyd George and Georges Clemenceau with his old Parisian connections, Sixtus and Xavier de Bourbon Parme, the Duchess of Montebello and Marquis Boni de Castellane, as well as Zamoyski's friend the Polish General of the Jesuits, Włodzimierz Ledóchowski, Retinger became a \"courier\" in the secretive European dynastic negotiation suing for peace with Austria. It became known as the \"Sixtus Affair\" but was a failure, due to Germany's refusal to cooperate thus making Austria more dependent on it. In 1917 he met Arthur \"Boy\" Capel, the half-French dilettante, polo player and \"sponsor\" of Coco Chanel. Capel is said to have planted in Retinger's mind the idea of a world federal government based on an Anglo-French alliance. After concerns for his personal safety due to his \"political meddling\" in Austria-Hungary and in the emergent Soviet Union, in 1918 Retinger was banned from France, and sought sanctuary in Spain for several months.\n\nHe travelled on to Cuba and then to Mexico, where he became an unofficial political adviser to union organizer Luis Morones whom he fortuitously met crossing the Atlantic, and to President Plutarco Elías Calles. A glimpse of Retinger, newly divorced and love lorn for the American journalist, Jane Anderson, appears in the biography of another American woman, the communist sympathiser Katherine Anne Porter, a member of the Morones circle. In it he is described as a \"Polish intriguer\" and \"British Marxist\". In 1921 while on an obscure mission to the United States to buy saddles, Retinger was arrested and imprisoned in Laredo and Porter was despatched from Mexico to get him released. That same year Retinger had proposed that Katherine Porter and her friend Mary Doherty accompany him to Europe to do \"collaborative work\", an offer that was spurned. Retinger helped advance Mexico's nationalization of its oil industry in 1928. His activities in Mexico lasted a total of almost seven years and only ended with Calles's fall from power in 1936. They inspired Retinger to write three volumes on the tumultuous events of that Latin American republic. The Mexican years were punctuated by trips back to Europe where he took on the role of Representative in the United Kingdom of the Polish Socialist Party (1924–1928). In 1926 he married his second wife, Stella, with whom he travelled to Mexico on one occasion. After her death in 1933 his two daughters were left in the care of their maternal grandmother and were estranged from him until the 1950s.\n\nIn the rest of the interwar period, he published many contributions in periodicals, such as the Polish \"Wiadomości Literackie\" (Literary News) (see Wiadomości), on literary and political subjects.\n\nDuring World War II, Retinger who was in London, was involved in arranging for Polish troops to be transferred to Britain from France. He was bidden by Winston Churchill personally to escort Władysław Sikorski by plane to England from France which had just capitulated to the invading Germans. He became principal adviser and confidant to the Prime Minister of the Polish Government in Exile now re-established in London. In fact, their political relationship went back to 1916 and was strengthened during Wladyslaw Sikorski's earlier brief stint as prime minister, 1922-23 in newly independent Poland, and came to greater fruition when both men were later in exile in London.\n\nSikorski's dependence on Retinger was the greater as he did not have mastery of English. At this time Retinger was despatched to talk with other exiled government representatives in London, who included Marcel-Henri Jaspar, Paul Van Zeeland, Paul-Henri Spaak in preparation for a post-war geopolitical landscape. He went on to posit a \"Sikorski Plan\" consisting of two stages, the first of which was signed in January 1942 and proposed a Polish-Czech confederation. The idea was to expand it into a Central European confederation with Poland and Lithuania, Czechoslovakia as its nucleus around which would be grouped Romania, Hungary, Yugoslavia and Greece. The agenda behind this was to create a common political blue-print for smaller countries abutting larger European powers and became the basis of a Belgian-Dutch union which would mirror the Polish-Czech arrangement.\n\nThis scheme of Retinger's caused problems between London and Moscow. In order not to tread on Soviet toes, the British altered their position and refused to back Sikorski's negotiations with the eight smaller European states. In his speech on the Council of Europe, Winston Churchill BBC radio broadcast on 21 March 1943 referred to the necessity of smaller nations forming groupings, but that it was too early to go into detail. The most Retinger was able to achieve was to push through the Sikorski-Mayski Agreement, signed on 30 July 1941, which provided for the formation of the Anders' army, thus ridding Stalin of the immediate human problem posed by the hundreds of thousands of Polish POWs and deportees from the Soviet occupied Kresy regions of the former Second Polish Republic, who after an arduous odyssey across thousands of miles would eventually end up as the United Kingdom's human problem. This trade-off adumbrated the Tehran and Yalta Conferences.\n\nRetinger narrowly avoided perishing in the sea off Gibraltar with Władysław Sikorski, in July 1943, but for the fact that he was not needed to accompany the premier on a troop inspection in the Middle East and would be better employed in London. The spare seat on the plane went to Sikorski's daughter who died with her father. Retinger was devastated by this turn of events. His relationship with Sikorski's successor, Stanislaw Mikolajczyk was much more ambivalent, but he obtained his consent for a special mission to Poland under SOE in April 1944.\n\nWith an SOE brief and without prior training, Retinger, aged 56, parachuted into occupied Poland with 2nd Lt. Tadeusz Chciuk-Celt, (see Operation Salamander), to meet with Polish underground figures, to deliver money to the Polish underground, and to \"explain to his fellow Poles in the homeland 'how are we going to lose this war'\". Following at least one assassination attempt on him, Retinger expressed his frustration thus:\n\nThe latter quip was a reference to elements in the Polish Underground Army, the AK who were convinced Retinger was not serving the interests of his country and should therefore be \"removed\". One apparent attempt to liquidate him in Poland was on the grounds of a \"death sentence\" to be carried out on the alleged orders of general Kazimierz Sosnkowski. It was foiled by the intervention of an old friend and AK fighter, Tadeusz Gebethner. There was also an attempt during his visit in occupied Poland to poison him, which failed. On his return to London, he spent some time in the Dorchester Hotel in London's Park Lane recovering from his ordeal of the trip, which left him lame in one leg for the rest of his life, possibly due to the Polyneuritis brought on by the poison. His first visitor at the Dorchester was Sir Anthony Eden, the foreign secretary.\n\nImmediately after the war, in 1945-6 Retinger travelled to Warsaw with emergency aid for the capital's population. It consisted largely of tons of British and US Army surplus, such as equipment, blankets and field-kitchens. When his erstwhile military escort from \"operation Salamander\", Tadeusz Chciuk and his new wife, Ewa, were arrested in Poland as subversives by the Polish Communist security service, Retinger allegedly appealed over their heads directly to Molotov in Moscow to have them released. Apparently the personal intervention succeeded. In 1948 the Chciuks became refugees in Germany.\n\nDark days followed World War II when tensions rose between former Western and Eastern allies and in April 1946 Retinger's flat in Bayswater, West London, was broken into and his and his secretary's files ransacked by persons unknown. He reported the matter to Scotland Yard, but the Metropolitan Police were not overly bothered. As a result, Retinger escalated his complaint and ended up being interviewed by the Britain's security services. His view was that the newly communist embassy of the Polish People's Republic were responsible for the break-in.\n\nFrom the moment Winston Churchill had made his \"Iron Curtain\" speech in Fulton, Missouri, in April 1946, Retinger turned his efforts to a modified European project he had harboured for decades.\n\nAfter World War II, Retinger feared another devastating war in Europe, this time fought between \"Russia\" and \"the Anglo-Saxons\". He became a leading advocate of European unification as a means of securing peace. He helped found both the European Movement and the Council of Europe, somewhat to the dismay of the philosopher Count Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi, the post-World War I anti-bolshevist founder of the Paneuropean Union movement.\n\nRetinger, with his connections in Holland, Belgium, and Switzerland (he was a friend of Denis de Rougemont), took his cue from Winston Churchill's 1947 Zurich speech and found fertile ground with thirteen British Conservative members of Parliament who backed the idea of a loose European association of states. Working in particular with Britain's Duncan Sandys, incidentally Churchill's son-in-law, he took on the lion's share of the work and became Honorary Secretary General of the European Movement. He organised the 1948 Hague Congress which brought together the two camps of those for a unified Europe and those in favour of a federal Europe. During the congress, Retinger networked assiduously among the delegates, who included the Vatican diplomat, Giovanni Montini, the future Pope Paul VI. Ensuing discussions led eventually to the formation in 1951 of a European Coal and Steel Community.\n\nRetinger was the initiator and architect of the informal Bilderberg conferences in 1952-54 and was their permanent secretary until his premature death in London in 1960. The original group which met in the eponymous Dutch hotel in 1954 was gathered by Retinger and included David Rockefeller, Denis Healey with Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, as chairman. The purpose was to stimulate understanding between Europe and the US as the Cold War developed by bringing together financiers, industrialists, politicians and opinion formers. All discussions were to be strictly under Chatham House Rules. A founding member of the group, later British Labour Foreign Secretary, Healey, described the secretive Bilderberg meetings as the \"brainchild\" of Retinger.\n\nDespite eschewing any distinctions or medals throughout his life, in 1958 he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. He died in poverty of lung cancer. He was buried at North Sheen Cemetery in the presence of five British cabinet ministers as well as of his two younger daughters who were finally reconciled with him. According to the oration of Sir Edward Beddington-Behrens, Retinger not only had special access to 10 Downing Street but also to the White House. \n\nRetinger's long time personal assistant and the editor of his posthumous memoirs, John Pomian, actually , was another Polish emigré in London, later a director of the Heim gallery in London's St James's, owned by the influential Polish art historian and philanthropist, Andrzej Ciechanowiecki.\n\nRetinger married twice. In 1912 he wed the well-born Otolia Zubrzycka (divorced 1921, died 1984), with whom he had a daughter, Malina (later Puchalska). In 1926 he wed Stella Morel (died 1933) – daughter of French-born pacifist and Dundee member of Parliament, E.D. Morel, and Mary, née Richardson – with whom he had two daughters, Maria (later Fforde) and Stasia (later French). Among his grandchildren are David French – translator into English of Andrzej Sapkowski's \"Witcher Saga\" – and fantasy novelist Jasper Fforde.\n\nDuring the Great War and after, Retinger appears to have fallen under the spell of several women, especially the American journalist Jane Anderson, a supposed lover of Joseph Conrad. Retinger's own liaison with Anderson brought about the breakdown of Retinger's marriage to Otolia and drove a wedge between him and his friend Conrad. However Conrad biographer, John Stape, gives an alternative version for the cooling of relations between the two men, suggesting instead that as Retinger's enthusiasms were not shared by the novelist, shortly after the war, without his charming wife by his side, Retinger's proneness to exaggeration and tactlessness made him less socially acceptable.\n\nOver the decades since his 1960 death, the left-leaning Retinger continues to draw fascination and controversy with his political skill, his apparently selfless single-mindedness, and his lasting institutional legacy in Europe and beyond. Adam Pragier, a notable Polish exile and trenchant political commentator (and a secondary-school contemporary of Retinger's), has described him as \"a sort of adventurer, but in the good sense of the word\". On the other hand, detractors impugn his influence due to alleged connections, with deeply secret and malign factions, for which there is so far no reliable evidence. He remains an enigma, and probably the one substantial contributor to postwar European peace who has no physical monument.\n\nIn 2000 The Daily Telegraph's Ambrose Evans-Pritchard revealed, from declassified US Government records, that:\n\nRetinger has inspired disparate opinions. He was a figure whose allegiances, like his roots, remain obscure and whose accounts of himself varied according to his audience, thus undercutting his reliability – as reflected in various Joseph Conrad biographies and numerous other sources, including the considered, annotated review, by Norbert Wójtowicz of Poland's Institute of National Remembrance, of Marek Celt's 2006 posthumously published \"Z Retingerem do Warszawy i z powrotem. Raport z podziemia 1944\", [\"To Warsaw with Retinger and Back. A Report from the Underground 1944\"] edited by Wojciech Frazik. The disparity in views on Retinger, despite the perception of some personality flaws, does not alter Retinger's mature postwar European legacy.\n\nBy J. H. Retinger:\n\nAbout Retinger:\n\n\n\n"}

Other towns within the commune include Dondelange, Keispelt, Meispelt, Nospelt and Olm.\n\nThe history of Kehlen goes back at least to Gallo-Roman period. Celtic tombs have been excavated in nearby Nospelt and a necropolis from the 1st century was discovered in the early 1970s on the \"Juckelsboesch\" plateau between Mamer and Kehlen. A beautiful dark blue glass bowl was among the offerings found there.\nA monument to the four gods depicting Juno, Minerva, Mercury and Hercules, possibly once the base of a Jupiter Column, was discovered on the heights of Schoenberg at the point where two Roman roads once crossed. The original is now in the National Museum of History and Art but a replica can be seen beside the entrance to the Schoenberg cemetery.\n\nSchoenberg is one of the oldest parishes in Luxembourg. It came under the authority of the St. Maximin's Abbey, Trier, as far back as 1637. The cemetery is classified as a national monument as many of the gravestones are from the beginning of the 16th century.\n\nUntil fairly recently, Kehlen was a farming community with a few cottage industries. Today, owing to its proximity to Luxembourg City (about 25 minutes by car outside the city), most of its inhabitants now work in the service sector.\n\nThe name \"Kehlen\" is said to originate from \"Callidovilla\" meaning the villa of Callidus.\n\nKehlen is twinned with:\n"}

He was a guardian of civil and political liberty.\nBernstorff was born in Hanover as a nephew of the statesman Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff (1712-72), whose position probably introduced him to Danish politics. His uncle induced him to study in the German and Swiss universities and travel for some years in Italy, France, England and Holland, to prepare himself for a statesman’s career. During these years he made the acquaintance of the poets Gellert and Jacobi, the writer Jean-Jacques Barthélemy, the duc de Choiseul, and Gottfried Achenwall, the statistician. After his European tour, he joined the Danish state service, first as a courtier and then from 1760 as a state official, both in foreign political and financial matters. His career was slow but steady. During the 1760s, he placed himself as an able but not outstanding official closely connected to his uncle. In the Struensee years from 1770–71, he was dismissed, but soon he was recalled by the new regime of Ove Høegh-Guldberg. He worked at first in the financial and economical departments, and took a special interest in agriculture. The improvements he introduced in the tenures of his peasantry anticipated in some respects the agricultural reforms of the next generation.\n\nIn 1773, Bernstorff was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs and his real Danish career began. He carried through the final solution of the Gottorp question through an exchange of territory with the Russian imperial family (in the 1773 Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo) and a Russian alliance. In general he supported a pro-Russian (but independent) line trying to hold Sweden in check. Since he saw Sweden as \"Denmark-Norway's most active and irreconcilable enemy\" and France as a Swedish ally, he avoided any conflict with England, seen as France's adversary. He created an outstanding position for himself but also made many enemies within the government. This was partly due to his alleged willfulness and partly due to political rivalry. The difficult years during the American War of Independence strengthened his wishes of an \"active neutrality\". His sympathy with England grew stronger when in 1779 Spain joined her enemies; and he was much inclined, the same winter, to join a triple alliance between Great Britain, Russia and Denmark-Norway, proposed by England for the purpose of compelling the Bourbon powers to accept reasonable terms of peace. But he was overruled by the Crown Prince Frederick, who thought such a policy too hazardous, when Russia declined to have anything to do with it. In 1780 he concluded a League of Neutrality with Russia and Sweden, a great foreign political triumph. At the same time he concluded a special agreement with England that secured Danish trade. A deep but temporary Russian dissatisfaction with the treaty, however, was exploited by his Danish rivals, and in November 1780, he was dismissed by Guldberg.\nBernstorff kept in the background in 1780-84 as an interested observer of the political situation, but he still enjoyed support in Copenhagen merchant circles and did not give up his political ambitions. Very early, he was connected to Crown Prince Frederick (Frederick VI) and became a part of the conspiracy against Guldberg. He supported the coup d'état of 1784, which made Frederick the Prince Regent.\nBernstorff was for second time made Minister of Foreign Affairs in May 1784, and that opened his real golden age. Until his death, he was in reality “prime minister” of Denmark, the leading man of the cabinet by whose advice the Prince Regent was normally guided. He was also temporarily the President of Danish Chancellery (Home Office) in 1788-89.\nIn Scandinavian matters, Bernstorff carried on a cautious pro-Russian policy without clashing with Sweden. The Russo-Swedish War in 1787-90 led to an abortive Danish involvement in 1788, and he managed to escape without any open breaks. During the next years he gradually phased out the Russian alliance and tried to improve relations to Sweden.\nBernstorff's most important problem in this period was the French Revolution and the wars in its wake. He firmly maintained a neutral line and showed his special virtuosity in balancing the great powers in order to protect Danish trade. He strongly kept to international law but avoided provocation. His diplomacy was strong but not rigid, and he maintained the economic position of the Danish merchants and in spite of problems with both France and England. All the while, he made his course respected. Among other things, he firmly avoided a politics of convoy while he clearly refused to take any part in the intervention in France. This was probably due to his principally neutral line but also partly to his growing respect of national integrity.\nBernstorff was of course a foreign politician, but because of his leading role he clearly influenced domestic politics. Very early on he was known as a supporter of independent farmers and of the great agrarian reforms (the abolition of Adscription 1788) and other reform laws of the 1790s. A loyal supporter of Danish absolutism, he was, however, in many ways a liberal by nature and the relative freedom of the press of this period was probably due to his wishes. His sympathies toward England and English political conditionsquite contrary to those of his uncleinfluenced him. His cultural interests were great but he did not much influence them to any extent.\n\nBernstorff is still considered one of the great Danish statesmen of the 18th century probably overshadowing his uncle. To his contemporaries his relatively early death was felt as a great misfortune – though it is impossible to decide whether he would have been able to maintain his political line. Being characterised a hot-tempered and cantankerous official as a young man, he gradually emerged as a brilliant and adroit man of the world. In many ways he was one of the last representatives of the German aristocratic statesmen of Danish state service before the national reaction began.\nCount Bernstorff was twice married, his wives being the two sisters of Counts Christian of Stolberg-Stolberg and Friedrich Leopold zu Stolberg-Stolberg. He left seven sons and three daughters. His son Count Christian Günther von Bernstorff (1769-1835) served as Danish secretary of state for foreign affairs and privy councillor. Another son Count Joachim Frederik Bernstorff (1771-1835) was attached to the Danish service and was associated with his brother in representing Denmark at the Congress of Vienna and in 1815 was appointed ambassador at that court.\nBernstorff Fjord and Bernstorff Glacier in Eastern Greenland were named after Andreas Peter Bernstorff.\n\n\n"}

Most controllers have a means of setting the frequency of irrigation, the start time, and the duration of watering. Some controllers have additional features such as multiple programs to allow different watering frequencies for different types of plants, rain delay settings, input terminals for sensors such as rain and freeze sensors, soil moisture sensors, weather data, remote operation, etc.\n\nThere are two basic types of controllers, electric and hydraulic. Most automatic irrigation valves are diaphragm valves in which the water above the diaphragm must be discharged for the valve to open. In a hydraulic system, the controller and valves are connected via small plastic tubes approximately 4 mm (¼ in) in diameter. The controller opens the tube connected to the valve, allowing that valve to open.\n\nMost newer systems employ electromechanical or electronic controllers. In this scenario, the controller is connected to an electrical circuit that operates a solenoid attached to each valve (solenoid valve). When the solenoid is actuated, the water above the diaphragm is relieved and the valve opens.\n\nAlthough sophisticated controllers that allow irrigation schedules to be automatically adjusted according to the weather have been available for many years, until recently these controllers were out of reach of the average consumer. One type is evapotranspiration controllers or \"ET controllers\". Several manufacturers are now producing controllers that can be automatically updated by either a simple weather sensor, via a pager that receives a daily update from a network of local weather stations, or through soil moisture sensors. Several companies have also introduced products that gathers information from the internet to update the watering schedule. \n\nThere are broadly two categories of irrigation controllers: domestic ones for gardening applications, and professional controllers for more demanding agricultural applications.\nWhile most domestic (gardening) controllers can only open/close zones based on a time duration, without any feedback from the irrigation process, professional irrigation controllers can irrigate based on volume (quantities defined in cubic meters / Gallons), receive feedback from the process, and react to actual events happening during the process.\n\nFor example, the typical professional controller will calculate the actual flow rate running in the system when a specific zone is operated, compare this to a pre-configured required amount, and adjust the irrigation process if deviation from the zone's flow rate is detected; This mechanism is called \"Flow monitoring\", and can prevent irrigation when a burst is occurring in the main line or in the zone's hydraulic components. The controller can also alert the operator locally via its interface, or remotely by sending an SMS or a message to a central control.\n\n"}

They are best known for the hits \"Sunday Morning\" and \"A way\" or \"Away\" (the name is interchangeable and has been noted as both on different albums/singles).\n\nThe band formed in 1984 in Trowbridge, Wiltshire. The original lineup consisted of singer/guitarist Trevor Tanner, drummer Jan Kalicki, and bassist Nick Chown; Tanner and Kalicki had previously played together in the short-lived punk band Moskow, where Trevor performed as Trevor Flynn (his mother's maiden name). Early gigs supported the likes of The Cult, The March Violets and The Lords of the New Church. In 1985, the band released their debut single, \"Sob Story\", followed by the mini-album, \"Giants\" and their hit song \"Happy Boy\". Word of mouth was such that the Bolshoi were able to sell out many of their early headlining performances.\n\nThe band moved to London in 1985, and their lineup expanded to include Paul Clark on keyboards. In 1986, they released their first full-length album, \"Friends\", and expanded their touring schedule to the U.S., South America and Poland. It was followed in 1987 by the album \"Lindy's Party\", on which the sound was more pop-oriented. TC Wall, reviewing the album in \"Underground\" magazine, described \"Lindy's Party\" as \"completely confident, commercial, professional, and dangerously catchy\" and \"a fine album that'll be caressed for generations\".\n\nStylistically, The Bolshoi was difficult to categorize. It has been described as a proto-goth band, similar in their live act to fellow Beggars Banquet signees, Bauhaus. Tanner was recognized for his dark, pensive lyrics that belied a social responsibility and awareness.\n\nAfter the release of \"Lindy's Party\", the band recorded a fourth album, but problems with their record label management impeded its release, and they disbanded as the 1980s drew to a close. The previously unreleased fourth album, titled \"Country Life\", had been lost for years but has now been resurrected by Beggars Banquet with extensive help from Tanner's current record label-head, Creative Director, David Paul Wyatt Perko. This new release is now available as one of five CDs in Beggar's 5-CD box set, put out via Beggar's imprint, Arkive.\n\nIn December 2018, The Bolshoi's official Facebook page announced that Trevor Tanner and Paul Clark were recording a new album, under the name The Bolshoi Brothers.\n\n\n\n"}

The same year he married Lucy Ann Earle; they had five sons and one daughter. He had fled his home country in 1867 to avoid military service. He went to Sheffield in about 1870 to start a steel business. He prospered and with partners ran the Continental Steel Works, which by 1890 was one of the most successful in the area, particularly with its production of high speed steel.\n\nHe became a town councillor in 1890 and Lord Mayor in 1904. In 1905 he received a knighthood. He was a Justice of the Peace and a benefactor of the University of Sheffield, particularly the Applied Sciences, and also helped establish chairs in German and French. His picture now hangs in Mappin Hall of the University, and his mansion became student accommodation, Halifax Hall.\n\nIn 1918, Jonas was charged with two others of conspiring to contravene the Official Secrets Act 1911 with regards to discussions about munitions with a German friend and customer in 1913. One of the defendants was released before the trial was concluded as there no evidence against him and Jonas and the other defendant were found not guilty of the main felony charges, but guilty of two minor misdemeanour charges. Jonas was fined £2,000 (equivalent to approximately £ today) and the co-defendant £1,000 and ordered to pay the prosecution's costs. Following his conviction, Jonas's Knighthood was removed in August 1918. In addition, his British citizenship was revoked, but he was not deported.\n\nJoseph Jonas died in August 1921 from a stroke. He was buried in All Saints Church, Ecclesall.

The film is based on the biblical drama \"Joseph and His Brethren\". The film is considered to be the first talkie filmed in Yiddish.\n\n\"Joseph in the Land of Egypt\" was intended to exploit the burgeoning Yiddish-speaking theater-going in America by introducing them to the new medium of film. Rather than creating an original film, Green took an Italian silent film of Jewish interest and dubbed it in Yiddish. Joseph Green, the producer, also took the starring role of Joseph for himself.\n\nThe film was well received by audiences in both the United States and Europe. That summer, Green took his film to Poland, then the largest Jewish center in Europe. Although most theater owners were reluctant to show it there, fearing that it would spark anti-Semitism, he eventually found two theater owners who were willing to show the film during the week of Passover. According to one story, the theater owners barred the door of their office with their bodies and declared that Green could not leave until he agreed to allow them to show the film.\n\n\"Joseph in the Land of Egypt\" was an immediate success and had a 30-week run at that theater before making its way through the rest of the country. With the film's success, Green went on to produce several more films in Poland, all of which were considered highlights of the Yiddish cinema.\n\n"}

They were founded in 1971 by Janusz Kruk and Elżbieta Dmoch. The band have recorded ten studio albums, three of which have been certified Gold in Poland, and established such evergreen hits as \"Chodź, pomaluj mój świat\", \"Windą do nieba\" and \"Iść w stronę słońca\". They have won a number of local and international awards, and performed in countries around the world, such as Germany, the Soviet Union, the United States, Canada and Cuba. 2 Plus 1 enjoyed the biggest popularity in the 1970s, but remained successful into the mid-1980s. At the turn of the two decades the band achieved a notable success in Western Europe and Japan with songs \"Easy Come, Easy Go\" and \"Singapore\". The end of 2 Plus 1's activity was marked by the death of Janusz Kruk in 1992. A successful, but short lived reunion took place at the end of the 1990s. 2 Plus 1 remain one of the most successful bands in the history of Polish popular music, and their musical legacy still proves influential in Poland.\n\nThe band was founded in Warsaw in January 1971 by a guitarist Janusz Kruk and a flautist Elżbieta Dmoch, who both had been part of a short lived band Warszawskie Kuranty in the 1960s. The two were joined by another guitarist, Andrzej Rybiński, and played their first live shows in hotel Bristol in Warsaw. The band worked with Polish lyricist Katarzyna Gärtner and became the first artist to perform her songs live. Initially called Smak Miodu (Polish for \"Taste of Honey\"), the trio would soon rename to Dwa Plus Jeden (2 Plus 1). In the summer of 1971, the group performed their first concert to a mass audience, at the National Festival of Polish Song in Opole, and were awarded for the song \"Nie zmogła go kula\". Andrzej Rybiński very soon left the group to work on his own project, Andrzej i Eliza, and was replaced by Andrzej Krzysztofik. The band performed \"Już nie będę taki głupi\" at the festival in Kołobrzeg and recorded their first EP, which featured four folk-flavoured songs. The band started to perform abroad, among others in West Berlin and the Soviet Union.\n\n1972 saw 2 Plus 1 achieve mainstream popularity with hits \"Czerwone słoneczko\" and \"Chodź, pomaluj mój świat\". The band performed at Sopot International Song Festival and in November recorded for RCA Italiana. In December 1972, their debut LP \"Nowy wspaniały świat\" was released by Polskie Nagrania Muza. Beside two previously known hits, it included songs \"Wstawaj, szkoda dnia\" and \"Hej, dogonię lato\" which also became popular. The album sold very well and was later certified Gold. 2 Plus 1 were proclaimed the band of the year by several media outlets, and their acoustic pop-folk music proved especially popular with teenagers. In March 1973, Janusz Kruk and Elżbieta Dmoch got married. The group then performed the song \"Zjechaliśmy kapelą\" at a German TV show \"Disco\" and were met with warm reception. In June, 2 Plus 1 performed for the third time at the Opole Festival and received an award for the song \"Codzienność\". In the same year, the band recorded a hit song \"Gwiazda dnia\" for the movie \"In Desert and Wilderness\", based on Henryk Sienkiewicz's novel of the same name.\n\nIn the spring of 1974, 2 Plus 1 performed in the United States and Canada for the first time, followed by Scotland, France, Switzerland and West Germany. With the song \"Kołysanka matki\", they took the 3rd place at the festival in Sopot. The group made an appearance in an all-star TV special \"\", performing \"Na luzie\", alongside such artists as Anna Jantar and Danuta Rinn. British magazine \"Music Week\" proclaimed 2 Plus 1 the star of the year. The band continued performing frequently in 1975, among others in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. Their second LP, \"Wyspa dzieci\", was a concept album and turned out to be another success, including previously known hits \"Gwiazda dnia\", \"Kołysanka matki\" and \"Na luzie\" as well as the popular title song.\n\nThe group scored another hit with the song \"Odpłyniesz wielkim autem\", which they recorded in English and released as a single in Germany. Their next project was a tribute suite to Zbigniew Cybulski, a famous Polish actor who had died in the late 1960s. The musical spectacle, showcasing more sophisticated sound than the group's previous efforts, was premiered in Opole in 1976 and received flattering feedback. Andrzej Krzysztofik left the group and was replaced by Cezary Szlązak, what gave shape to what would turn out the band's most successful line-up. In the early 1977, on the 10th anniversary of Cybulski's death, the band started to work on their third studio album, \"Aktor\", based around the previously known musical spectacle. 2 Plus 1 toured with that repertoire not only in Poland, but also in East Germany and Czechoslovakia, where the album was released as \"Herec\". In the same year, 2 Plus 1 released another single in West Germany, which featured songs \"Ring Me Up\" and \"Free Me\".\n\nIn 1978, the band recorded \"Teatr na drodze\", an album embracing their pre-\"Aktor\", accessible pop-folk style. It is this album that features one of 2 Plus 1's biggest hits \"Windą do nieba\", which went on to become an evergreen. Other notable songs on the LP included \"Ding-Dong\", \"Romanse za grosz\" and \"Ballada łomżyńska\", the latter with a contribution from the legendary Polish musician Czesław Niemen. In the summer, 2 Plus 1 went to Cuba, where they performed \"La Habana mi amour\" and taped a TV special. At the Sopot Festival, the band won an award for \"Windą do nieba\" and \"Ding-dong\". In the same year, they released a new single \"Taksówka nr 5\", which turned out another success. In March 1979, 2 Plus 1 visited Cuba again, where they successfully toured for two weeks. Their double A-side single, featuring songs \"Margarita\" and \"La Habana mi amour\", was the first record by a Polish artist ever released in Cuba. Meanwhile, in Poland, 2 Plus 1 released their fifth studio album, \"Irlandzki tancerz\". The LP was inspired by Irish folk music and contained Polish translations of thirteen old Irish ballads. The album received highly favourable reviews and was another major seller in 2 Plus 1's career. A promotional musical film of the same name was premiered on television in May 1979.\n\nIn the summer of 1979, 2 Plus 1 recorded their third single for the German market, the disco-pop song \"Easy Come, Easy Go\". The band performed it on the popular West German TV show \"Musikladen\", and the East German variety show \"Ein Kessel Buntes\". The song was a surprise success, charting within the German top 40. The follow-up album \"Easy Come, Easy Go\", recorded entirely in English with German and American musicians, was released in early 1980. It was met with a modest success and would eventually receive Gold certification in Poland. It spawned another hit, \"Singapore\", which reached number 7 in Japan. In the same year, 2 Plus 1 were headlining the Sopot Festival where they performed their English-language material.\n\nIn 1981, the band released a non-album song \"Iść w stronę słońca\", which went on to become one of their biggest hits in Poland. Their second international album, \"Warsaw Nights\", was released in the same year, promoted by singles \"Mama Chita\" and \"Lady Runaway\". The band performed in Villach, Austria and spent several months touring in the USA. However, the growing popularity of 2 Plus 1 in Western Europe was suddenly interrupted by the breakout of martial law in Poland in December 1981. As this had complicated travelling abroad, the group focused back on the Polish market. Their last international offering was the song \"Rocky Doctor\", released two years later.\n\nIn 1982, 2 Plus 1 released a new wave-inspired double A-side single, with songs \"Kalkuta nocą\" and \"Obłędu chcę\", which enjoyed considerable popularity. In 1983, the band gave a critically acclaimed, avant-garde performance at the Opole Festival, where they premiered songs from the forthcoming album. Their eighth studio LP, \"Bez limitu\", introduced the band's new image and musical style, which now explored new wave, rock and synthpop. The album spawned hits \"Nic nie boli\", \"Requiem dla samej siebie\", \"Superszczur\" and \"XXI wiek (Dla wszystkich nas)\", and was certified Gold the following year. 2 Plus 1 were in fact one of the very few artists from the 1970s who remained commercially successful in the 1980s.\n\nIn February 1984, 2 Plus 1 performed a concert at the Warsaw Congress Hall, which was broadcast on television. Their next single, the uptempo synthpop track \"Wielki mały człowiek\", became one of their biggest hits. The group teamed up with Maciej Zembaty and John Porter to work on their ninth album, \"Video\". Released in 1985, it was largely drawing from synthpop and New Romanticism, and turned out another success. The LP spawned further hits \"Video\" and the Polish-English \"Chińskie latawce\", the latter a duet between Elżbieta Dmoch and John Porter. A TV special was filmed to promote the album. In 1985, Cezary Szlązak released a solo single, featuring songs \"Bezpłatny kurs\" and \"Inne życie, inny świat\".\n\nAfter the release of \"Video\", 2 Plus 1 have significantly limited their live appearances and media exposure. 1986 saw the release of the retrospective \"Greatest Hits Live\". In 1987, Janusz Kruk started to compose music to theatrical plays, including \"Szaleństwa pana Hilarego\", based on Julian Tuwim's short story. The band recorded one new song, \"Ocalić coś\", later released on a various artists compilation \"Całuj gorąco\". Janusz and Elżbieta broke up in the second half of the 1980s, after Janusz left her for another woman. The couple divorced in 1989, but remained friends.\n\nIn 1988, 2 Plus 1 started to work on a new album and performed several new songs on a TV show \"Premie i premiery\". In 1989, their tenth and final studio album \"Antidotum\" was released. The record didn't go as far as previous albums, but several tracks gained a moderate popularity, most notably \"Ocalę Cię\". The band embarked on a tour in the USA. During one of the concerts, Janusz Kruk, who had already grappled with heart problems, fainted on stage. That prompted the group to take some time off from extensive touring, and Janusz focused on composing soundtracks to plays. In 1991, the hits collection \"18 Greatest Hits\" became their first album released directly in CD format.\n\nIn June 1992, Janusz Kruk died of a heart attack. Elżbieta, who never got over the loss, moved from Warsaw to a countryside, and subsequently gave up public and artistic life. In 1997, another compilation \"Greatest Hits Vol. 2\" was released, which focused on rare and previously unreleased tracks. In the fall of 1998, Cezary and Elżbieta decided to reactivate 2 Plus 1, recruiting two new musicians. Their first performances were met with enthusiastic response and the band embarked on a successful tour. They appeared on several TV shows, including \"Szansa na sukces\". However, in early 1999, Elżbieta suddenly decided to withdraw from all the future plans and 2 Plus 1 ultimately disbanded. Cezary Szlązak founded his own group, Cezary Szlązak Band.\n\nAt the end of the 1990s, and after 2000, numerous 2 Plus 1 compilations appeared on the market, released by various record companies. In 2002, Elżbieta made a guest appearance at a community centre in Łomża, where a teenage group staged a play as a tribute to 2 Plus 1 and their music. In January 2005, a Polish TV program \"Uwaga!\" reported on her apparently poor living conditions, which caused a massive sympathetic response. In August 2008, Elżbieta attended a secret 2 Plus 1 fans gathering in Warsaw.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, two additional musicians supported the band: Adam Pilawa (piano, violin) and Andrzej Wójcik (drum kit).\n\n\n"}

It is located on a hill overlooking the Çoruh River near the Deriner Dam. It is a former bishopric and (vacant) Armenian Catholic titular see and the home of Artvin Çoruh University.\n\nThe area has a rich history but has not been studied extensively by archaeologists in recent decades. Artifacts dating back to the Bronze Age and even earlier have been found. The area was part of the kingdom of Colchis and part of the Greater Armenia but was always vulnerable to invasions, first the Scythians from across the Caucasus, then the Muslim armies led by Habib, son of Caliph Uthman who controlled the area from 853 AD to 1023 when it was conquered by the Byzantines from the Sac Emirate linked to the Abbasids. \n\nThe Principalities of Tao-Klarjeti arose out of the turmoils of the Muslim conquests in the Caucasus in the 7th and 8th centuries, succeeding the early medieval Kingdom of Iberia and latter leading unification of Georgian Kingdom. For a long time the region became a cultural safe-house and one of the most important religious centers of Georgia.\n\nThe Seljuk Turks of Alp Arslan conquered the area in 1064 AD; but soon, it was briefly recaptured by the Georgians with the help of the Byzantines. But in 1081 Turkish forces led by Saltukoğlu Beylik managed to take it back with the aid of Melikşah. With the collapse of the Seljuks, the Artvin area came under the control of the Ildeniz tribe of the Anatolian Turkish beyliks. \n\nKingdom of Georgia regained control over the region through Georgian-Seljuk wars. Taking advantage of Georgia's weakness through Mongol invasions, Turkmen incursions started to south-western Georgia. The largely Georgian population of the region called on lord of Samtskhe, to assist them against the Turkmens. By the mid-13th century, the Jaqelis realm thus incorporated most of the mountainous areas of north eastern Anatolia. Various Turkish clans fought for control over the area and this continued until the Safavids ultimately took advantage of this fighting and conquered the area in 1502.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire under Mehmet II defeated the Empire of Trebizond to bring the eastern Black Sea coast and the mountainous hinterland under their control. Subsequent expeditions into the mountains by Selim I and Mehmed Han Yusufeli gave them control of a number of castles and thus the whole district. Kara Ahmet Pasha, the vizer of Suleiman I formed the first Livane Sanjak with the name Pert-Eğekte. On 13 July 1551, with İskender Pasha's Ardanuç castle, the Ottoman control of Artvin was secure. Ahmed III's vizer Hasan Pasha founded the city of Batum in the newly acquired lands of Ajaria and it became the hub of the area.This lasted 250 years until the area was ceded to the Russians by the Ottoman Empire following the Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829), and recovered and again ceded at the conclusion of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78. Artvin was in a war zone and continuously changing control between Russia and Turkey with the Treaties of Brest-Litovsk, Moscow and Kars. All this fighting and uncertainty between Russia and Turkey in the late 19th century caused the people of Artvin (Muslim Georgians) to suffer terribly, with much of the population moving westwards away from the Russian-controlled zones.\n\nThe Russians withdrew from Artvin following the Russian Revolution of 1917; but when the First World War ended with the Ottomans on the losing side, British troops moved into the area in 1918, followed by Democratic Republic of Georgia. As a result of Red Army invasion of Georgia, Artvin was ceded to newly established Turkey under the Treaty of Kars in 1921.\n\nAbove the strategically placed town and road is the fortress, which was once within the medieval Georgian district of Nigali. The site consists of a single circuit wall surrounding the summit of the outcrop, several impressive rooms, an outwork protecting the south entrance, and a large donjon at the west. There are also embrasures and windows suitable for archers. In 1983 the fortress was surveyed and three years later an accurate scaled plan and description were published.\n\nOn 30 April 1850, the papal bulla \"Universi Dominici gregis\" from Pius IX established the Armenian Catholic eparchy (Eastern Catholic diocese) of Artvin of the Armenians, with jurisdiction over the extreme northeast of Turkey and in the (Russian) Transcaucasus. It has had only three incumbents:\n\nUnder an agreement between Russia and the Holy See in 1904, Catholic Armenians throughout the Caucasus and interior Russia were entrusted to an apostolic administrator resident in Tbilisi (Georgia), but the Soviet authorities imprisoned him, and he died some time before 1937. The diocese had already lost most of its faithful in the Armenian Genocide at the end of the First World War.\nThe Holy See continued to list the eparchy of Artvin as a vacant residential see until 1971, but in 1972, suppressing it as such, began to list Artvin as the Armenian Catholic titular bishopric of Artvin (Curiate Italian) / Artwin / Artuinen(sis) Armenorum (Latin).\n\nHowever it never has had a titular incumbent (yet?), who should be of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank.\n\nIn the census of 1897, the town of Artvin was mainly populated by Armenians, part of whose came from the Mush and Van region. But the district in which it lay was largely Muslim. Outside of the town, the population in the district numbered 49,049 people, of whom 39,997 (82%) were Turks, 5,458 (11%) Georgian and 3,173 (6%) Armenian. \n\n\nThere are a number of Ottoman Empire houses and public buildings, including :\n\nThe surrounding countryside offers many places for climbing, trekking and rafting.\n\nArtvin is known for the Caucasus (Kafkas in Turkish) Culture and Arts Festival, a celebration that takes place at the Kafkasör plateau every year. The most famous event is the Bull wrestling which draws many local and international visitors.\n\nArtvin, unlike most of the coastal Black Sea Region of Turkey, the city has a Warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb) under the Köppen classification, bordering extremely closely on an Oceanic climate (Cfb), with the wettest winter month, December, having extremely 3 times the amount of precipitation as the driest summer month, August, which is the prime classifier for a dry-summer climate under Köppen's system. It also has and warm summer oceanic climate (Dob) under Trewartha classification.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its headquarters are located at Fort Lesley J. McNair in Washington, D.C. The missions of the units in the Military District of Washington include ceremonial tasks as well as a combat role in the defense of the National Capital Region.\n\nBesides Fort McNair, the following installations are included under the umbrella of the MDW's command: \n\nThe Military District of Washington also represents the U.S. Army in the Joint Force Headquarters National Capital Region (JFHQ-NCR), as well as oversight of all ceremonial operations in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nThe current Commanding General of the Military District of Washington is Major General Omar J. Jones IV. The Military District of Washington Chief of Staff, and liaison to the JFHQ-NCR, is Colonel Brandon S. Robbins. The Commanding General, Chief of Staff, and Command Sergeant Major of the Military District of Washington hold the same positions at the JFHQ-NCR, which supervises military planning for the defense of the National Capital Region.\n\nMDW can trace its origin back to 1921 when the War Department created the District of Washington. Today MDW is one of the Army's major commands. Its installations include Fort McNair, the nation's second-oldest military post still in use, and Fort Myer, Gen. Philip Sheridan's cavalry showplace and site of the first military aircraft flight.\n\nThe District of Washington initially included Fort Washington, Md., Fort Hunt, Va., the District of Columbia and Fort Myer. With the dissolution of the District of Washington in 1927, the commanding general of the 16th Infantry Brigade at Fort Hunt became responsible for conducting military ceremonies and administering discipline to service members in the nation's capital.\n\nIn 1942, about five months after the U.S. entered World War II, the War Department created the U.S. Army Military District of Washington to plan for a ground defense of the nation's capital.\n\nMDW was headquartered during those years in \"temporary\" buildings at Gravelly Point, Virginia., near Washington National Airport. It moved to Second Street, S.W., in Washington, D.C., in the early 1960s, and to its present headquarters at Fort Lesley J. McNair in 1966.\n\nDuring the World War II era, MDW was gradually reorganized as a service-and-support command. One of MDW's main responsibilities was servicing the newly built Pentagon through the Army Headquarters commandant. The U.S. Army Band, \"Pershing's Own,\" also became an integral part of the command's ceremonial mission during this period.\n\nAt the end of World War II, the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard) was deactivated in Germany. This regiment, the oldest U.S. infantry unit, was reactivated in 1948 and assigned to MDW to meet the command's tactical commitments and for military ceremonies.\n\nAlthough MDW's mission has remained the same, it has gained, lost and regained various installations and support responsibilities over the years. Vint Hill Farms and Arlington Hall Station, both in Virginia, and Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., were once part of MDW. Cameron Station and Davison Army Airfield, near Fort Belvoir, joined MDW in the 1950s.\n\nIn 1980 MDW gained responsibility for the administration and daily operation of Arlington National Cemetery, in addition to the ceremonial support the command has always provided.\n\nIn 1987 MDW's support responsibilities for the Pentagon were transferred elsewhere. Fort Belvoir became a major subordinate command in 1988.\n\nIn 1992 Davison Aviation Command was reorganized as the Operational Support Airlift Command, with responsibilities for fixed-wing Army aircraft support throughout the United States. Additionally, they provide rotary-wing (helicopter) support to Army leadership and distinguished officials in the National Capital Region.\n\nIn April 1993, MDW reorganized its MACOM staff and the Fort Myer Military Community formed a garrison staff to support Forts Myer and McNair, and Cameron Station.\n\nOn 1 October 1993, Fort Meade, and Fort Ritchie in Maryland, and A.P. Hill in Virginia joined the MDW family of installations. The command more than doubled in size as MDW went from four posts totaling to eight posts totaling . The number of service members and civilians on MDW installations also increased from 16,166 to 61,531.\n\nCameron Station officially closed on 30 September 1995. Most of the organizations were relocated to either Fort Belvoir or Fort Myer.\n\nFort Hamilton, New York, became the newest member of MDW's family of installations when it was transferred to MDW from U.S. Army Forces Command 6 October 1997. The post is 172 years old.\n\nOn 10 June 2010, Secretary of the Army John M. McHugh rescinded MDW's responsibility for the administration and daily operation of Arlington National Cemetery. However, MDW still maintains ceremonial support for funerals and guarding the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\n\nSince its inception in 1942, the Military District of Washington has been involved in protecting and staging special event ceremonies. These ceremonies include inauguration ceremonies starting with Franklin Roosevelt's 4th inauguration on January 20th, 1945. the MDW is also responsible for state funerals. They include anyone within Washington who is granted a state funeral. This includes former Presidents, Senators, Representatives, and other dignitaries. The MDW is extensively involved in the planning of and execution of a state funeral including advice and consent from the family and ceremonial support outside of Washington. The latter included a state funeral held for Richard Nixon held in the shadow of his boyhood home when he died following a stroke in April 1994.\n\nCurrent units commanded by the district include;\n\n\n\n\n"}

From 2005 to 2014, America's Best was a division of National Vision, a privately held portfolio company owned by Berkshire Partners. In 2014, National Vision, Inc, was sold to KKR & Co. L.P.\n\nAmerica's Best Contacts & Eyeglasses is the largest buyer of designer overstock eyeglass frames in the United States.\n\nAmerica's Best Contacts & Eyeglasses and its predecessor entities were founded in July 1978 by Bill Grody (at the age of 25), soon after federal deregulation permitted price advertising of eyewear, eye exams, and related services and supplies. \n\nABC&E's first location was on Chicago's \"Magnificent Mile\" in September 1978 on the 15th floor of a North Michigan Avenue office building, along with ABC&E's in-house advertising agency. From 1978 to early 1990, ABC&E remained internally financed. By 1990 the company had 34 locations including a full-service lens manufacturing facility. In April 1990, Grody sold the majority of the company in an LBO to Boston-based financial investors, Berkshire Partners, for $24 million, retaining minority ownership along with his senior management team. In December, 1993, Grody orchestrated a management-led leveraged buyout of ABC&E, repurchasing the majority of the company for $40 million, with Berkshire Partners choosing to maintain a minority position.

{"id": "1887376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887376", "title": "Hyundai Santa Fe", "text": "Hyundai Santa Fe\n\nThe Hyundai Santa Fe ( \"hyeondae santape\") is a sport utility vehicle (SUV) produced by the South Korean manufacturer Hyundai since 2000. It is named after the city of Santa Fe, New Mexico, and was introduced for the 2001 model year as Hyundai's first SUV, released at the same time as the Ford Escape and Pontiac Aztek. The Santa Fe was a milestone in the company's restructuring program of the late 1990s because the SUV was a hit with American buyers. The SUV was so popular that at times, Hyundai had trouble supplying the demand. The Santa Fe quickly became Hyundai's best seller and contributed to Hyundai's success in the United States. Between 2006 and 2012, the Santa Fe fell between the slightly smaller compact crossover Tucson and the larger, yet related luxury crossover SUV Veracruz.\n\nThe second generation Hyundai Santa Fe was awarded 2008 \"Consumer Reports\" \"top pick\" and was among the top 10 vehicles for 2008 unveiled in the magazine's issue. The magazine's annual ratings, based on road tests and predicted safety and reliability, are considered highly influential among consumers.\n\nIn 2012, the third generation Santa Fe became available in two versions (regular and extended versions), with the (five-seater) Sport in September 2012 and the extended long wheel base model which replaced the Veracruz, available at showrooms in November 2012. As of 2019, the Santa Fe has been slotted between the Tucson and the Palisade.\n\nIn its first year in production, the Santa Fe was offered with one of two engine and transmission combinations. In North America, a fuel-efficient 2.4 L four-cylinder engine was standard equipment and could be mated with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. A Delta V6 offered more power than the four-cylinder but was only available with the automatic. Front wheel drive was standard (with traction control optional with the V6) and 4WD was optional. A 2.0 L Common Rail Turbo Diesel (CRTD) was offered outside the United States. Australian Santa Fes went on sale in November 2000 with only one engine/transmission choice – a 2.7L V6 mated to a four-speed automatic transmission. 4WD was standard. A cheaper 2.4L four-cylinder joined the range several months later in 2001, but was only available with a manual transmission.\n\nThe Santa Fe entered its second year with only one minor change involving the placement of the V6 emblem to a higher location on the tailgate. In Feb 2002, the center dash vents and buttons were restyled. The clock was relocated to the center dash from its prior location in the overhead map light assembly, which was also restyled. Demand for the Santa Fe continued to be up but owners had several suggested changes for Hyundai.\n\nMid-2002\n\nIn a rare mid-year model change, Hyundai increased fuel tank capacity from and a sunroof option was added in May 2002. At the same time, chrome interior door handles replaced matte gray handles and a chrome shifter gate on automatic equipped models replaced matte silver gate trim. Few models also received a factory alarm confirmation chirp feature when locked twice via remote, but was rarely equipped until the 2003 model began production.\n\nIn 2003, Hyundai responded to some of the customer complaints and suggestions such as the fact that the hood used a prop and not gas struts, there was no light in the glove compartment, and the car itself did not have enough power. In 2003, Hyundai introduced the 3.5-liter V6 in addition to the other two gas engines in North America. The bigger engine came with a computer-controlled four-wheel drive system. A Monsoon high-performance sound system came standard on the mid-level GLS model and came with a 6-disc CD changer on the top-tier LX. Rounding out the changes in the 2003 model was the discontinuation of the highly unpopular Pine Green which in some owner circles has gained the nickname 'Yucky Green'. In Australia, the four-cylinder Santa Fe was dropped in 2003, due to slow sales, leaving the 2.7L V6 automatic as the only model.\n\nHyundai continued to post sales records with the Santa Fe as it rolled into 2004 with very minor changes. The manual climate controls on the base GL and mid-line GLS were revised very slightly. The remote keyless entry confirmation 'chirp' when the 'LOCK' button on the remote was pressed twice became standard.\n\nMid-2004\n\nMidway through the year the AM/FM antenna was moved from on the glass in the rear driver's side window to a three-inch (76 mm) rubber antenna in the center of the roof just above the tailgate.\n\nThe Santa Fe received its final facelift for 2005. Changes were made to the grille, taillights, rear bumper, interior instrument cluster. The instrument cluster was redesigned with the speedometer now reading 140 mph (earlier models only indicated 130 mph) and a better-designed toll ticket slot in the driver's sun visor. Both sun visors also received extensions so the sun could be blocked out better when coming in from the side. The base Santa Fe was discontinued that time, making way for the Tucson.\n\nIn Australia, all models received body-colored (painted) bumpers from 2005 on. The color 'Sandstone' was discontinued in favor of a slightly different color named 'Mocha Frost'. The GL trim was dropped as was the four-cylinder engine and its respective 5-speed manual transmission. The 2.7 L V6 took over duties as the base engine. A passenger airbag cutoff that prevents the airbag from deploying if the seat is unoccupied (or occupied by a small person) was also added. A 3-point seatbelt was added to the center rear seating position, as well. The calendar function, housed in the overhead console was removed and a compass took its place.\n\nThe last year of this Santa Fe saw few changes. Two colors were discontinued for 2006, Merlot and Canyon Red. A rare color, Dark Emerald Green, was introduced mid-year. It did not appear in any sales brochures and could have only been ordered by a dealership. The LX trim level was renamed 'Limited' and got a corresponding tailgate badge, a first for the Santa Fe of any trim level. Another first was the availability of a monochromatic paint scheme, a departure from the contrasting gray cladding previously standard. The monochromatic option was only available on the Limited in black. In total, these options ran $1900, pushing the Santa Fe's total asking price to nearly $30,000.\n\nIn Europe, the new Santa Fe model was launched in April as a 2006 model, offering a new 2.2-liter diesel-powered engine and updated 2.7-liter gasoline-powered V6.\n\nPart of a joint venture with Hyundai Motors that began in 2002, a Chinese company, Hawtai Motor, manufactured the first-generation Santa Fe. While it did make Hyundai-branded models for sale on the Chinese market, one of the versions it debuted under its own brand name in 2009 was the Santa Fe C9. Utilizing a Rover-acquired engine, it may have been priced at a significant discount to those bearing the Hyundai name.\n\nHyundai ended its partnership with Hawtai in 2010 and production ended in 2015.\nThe next-generation 2007 Santa Fe debuted at the 2006 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The first production Santa Fe rolled off Hyundai's Montgomery, Alabama assembly line on April 18, 2006. It shares this assembly line with the current generation Hyundai Sonata. The new generation sheds the old style's quirky design in favor of a more contemporary look.\n\nIn the United States, the new generation is offered in GLS, SE, and Limited versions. The new Santa Fe sees the return of a manual transmission, but only when mated with the V6. The V6 (a retuned version of the same engine found in the Sonata) is standard on the SE and Limited and comes only with a 5-speed automatic. Both 2WD and AWD models with a 3.3 L have a fuel economy of city and highway. The 2.2l diesel engine (not available in the US) with has mixed cycle of 7.2l and a city cycle of 8.0l. The 4WD is a Borg-Warner Torque Management device, which diverts power to the wheels with best grip according to the amount of slip. If the front wheels spin slightly, 10% of the torque will transfer to the rear axle. If the front wheels start to slip a lot, 50% of the torque will transfer to the rear axle. Body lean in turns, a problem with the previous generation, has been reduced in the new Santa Fe. Both road and wind noise have also been reduced.\n\nNewly standard on the latest iteration of the Santa Fe are all the safety features the previous model lacked or charged as extra. Electronic Stability Control (ESC), side-curtain airbags for all seating rows, a tire pressure monitor, active front head restraints, and anti-lock brakes are all standard. A heated windshield wiper grid located in the front wipers' 'park' position helps to thaw ice buildup on the blades in colder climates. Some features like the tailgate flip glass and the lower body cladding were not integrated into the new model.\n\nThe interior has been upgraded as well with blue-lit dashboard controls (unlike the green color used in other Hyundai models), a gated shifter pattern, illuminated cup holders, and higher quality leather on Limited models. The rear seat head restraints caused visibility problems in the previous model due to their size. The new style features 'shingled' head rests that when lowered completely, sit flush with the top of the seat, helping to maximize rear visibility. The middle rear seating position now comes with its own head restraint and a three-point seat belt built in. LATCH child seat anchors are also standard, and an optional 50/50 third row seat allows Santa Fe to seat seven passengers.\n\nPricing remained competitive despite the upward move in size and feature content.\n\nIn Malaysia, Hyundai Santa Fe is available as a Complete knock down model rebadged as Inokom Santa Fe. The Inokom Santa Fe is only available in CRDi 2.2-liter I4 Diesel and 2.7-liter V6.\n\nFor 2008, only minor changes were applied to the Santa Fe. A navigation system made by LG was offered and the Infinity sound system and the power glass sunroof were made standard on Limited models. The non-metallic white paint trim was dropped, leaving the pearl white as the only white color available on the Santa Fe.\n\n2009 saw only minor changes for the Santa Fe. The 16\" wheels on the base GLS model (USA specification) were dropped and replaced with black steel wheels and plastic covers. Additionally, the GLS received black plastic mirrors as opposed to the body-colored mirrors of the higher-tier SE and Limited models. This cut in equipment was rumored to be a countermeasure to offset the price increase of offering an iPod plug-in for the stereo system. Because of the black mirrors and wheel covers, the additional cost of the iPod adapter was negated, leaving the base price of the vehicle unchanged.\n\nThe Santa Fe topped the “20 least expensive 2009 vehicles to insure” list by Insure.com. According to research, the Santa Fe is the least expensive vehicle to insure. Low rates tend to reflect a vehicle's safety.\n\nDecember 2009 a more economical ‘R’ series piezo electric injector-equipped 2.2-litre turbo-diesel four-cylinder producing 145 kW of power (up 27 per cent) at 3800rpm and 436Nm of torque at 1800rpm (421Nm for the manual).\n\nA mid-cycle refresh designed in Germany for the Santa Fe was implemented for the 2010 model year. The grille now includes horizontal and vertical gridded bars as opposed to the horizontal two-bar grille on previous models, and grilles are now body-colored instead of black. New rear taillights include all-red taillight covers with extensive chrome outlay, and new 5 split-spoke alloy wheels have replaced the previous 5- and 6-spoke wheels. All Santa Fe's now include standard Bluetooth hands-free phone connectivity and steering wheel audio controls, new darker wood trim, and metallic steering wheel inlay. Gauges have been designed with a new lettering and numbering 'font' and backlight design. A new touch-screen navigation system with rear back-up camera was now available. Finally, for the US market, the optional third row seat has been discontinued, leaving the larger Veracruz the only currently sold Hyundai in the United States to seat more than five persons.\n\nPowertrain changes included a choice of the standard six-speed manual transmission or the optional six-speed automatic transmission. Engine choices include a 2.4-litre four-cylinder and a 3.5-litre V6 engine. The latter engine is also used in the Kia Sorento. Both engines generate greater power while obtaining greater fuel economy than previous engine models. Sales began in early January 2010.\n\nOnly minor changes were applied to the Santa Fe for 2011. The 1050-watt Infinity sound system became standard on Limited trim whereas it had only been previously bundled with the optional navigation system. Five new colors were added, as well, including Moonstone Silver, Frost White Pearl, Sonoran Red, Mineral Gray, and Espresso Brown.\n\nOn September 1, 2010, North American production of the Santa Fe shifted to Kia's new West Point, Georgia assembly plant for the 2011 model year. This was done to free up production capacity at the Alabama plant for the new Sonata and new Elantra. The Santa Fe fills the void left for a Kia-built Hyundai sold in the United States & Canada after Hyundai ended production of the Entourage minivan in 2009. Kia, however, is 49.2% owned by Hyundai.\n\nThe Santa Fe only received minor changes for 2012: The all-body colored grille (in North American markets) was straightened and received chrome accents while the textured strip below the headlights was changed from amber to clear. The interior received a new shift knob and downhill brake assist was added. The 2012 model will be discontinued by the end of the year, successfully ending production for the second generation.\nThere is a Hyundai Santa Fe Blue Hybrid that is powered by gasoline engine coupled to a electric motor. The Santa Fe blue Hybrid uses a 270 V lithium polymer battery.\n\nHyundai is recalling almost 200,000 Santa Fe SUVs from 2007–2009 model years, because the front passenger airbags may not deploy in a crash due to a possible problem with the occupant classification system. The system gauges the size of a passenger and based on that whether an air bag should be deployed. A software update rectifies the issue.\n\nThe Second-generation Santa Fe earned \"Top Safety Pick\" award by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It also received maximum 5 star safety ratings by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The Hyundai Santa Fe earned maximum five star safety rating from Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP).\n\nThe Second-generation Hyundai Santa Fe topped the “20 least expensive 2009 vehicles to insure” list by Insure.com.\n\nAdvertising Standards Bureau of Australia banned a Santa Fe TV commercial titled 'Restless' or 'Toddler' in 2007, which ASB argued that it promotes an illegal driving activity: an underaged person (a toddler) driving a car.

Unveiled at the 2012 New York Auto Show on April 4, the third generation Santa Fe features two wheelbase variants: shorter 5-seat Sport variant and the long-wheelbase version (called Sante Fe XL in Canada) with three rows of seats and available seating for six or seven passengers. The longer Santa Fe also receives a unique grille design, optional 19 inch alloy wheels, flush dual exhaust tips, and a body shape that accentuates the crossover's added passenger and cargo room hind-wise from the B-pillar. Both models feature the new \"Storm Edge\" design prototype, eventually to launch on all other models, and feature refreshed Santa Fe unibody crossover platform, akin to most of today's SUVs.\n\nThe 2013 Santa Fe Sport models arrives with an all four-cylinder engine lineup. The CUV's standard engine is a 2.4 L developing , with a 2.0 L turbo four on offer. Front-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive being optional. The Santa Fe Sport has Hyundai's Torque Vectoring Cornering Control feature for upgraded drive performance. Both engines shift through a six-speed automatic transmission (already found in the Azera sedan), returning up to for the naturally aspirated model and for the Santa Fe Sport 2.0T model. The long-wheelbase is offered in North America exclusively with a 3.3 L, V6 engine, whose numbers were not beaten by a same-class vehicle so far.\n\nThe 2013 Santa Fe Sport went on sale in September 2012 for the North American market. The long-wheelbase variant would follow suit in November 2012 and went on sale in early 2013 after the Veracruz ended production.\nThe Korean-spec Santa Fe was launched in Asia since April 19, 2012, in short wheel base form with 7-seater capacity. Available engine types are a 2.0L E-VGT R-Line and 2.2L E-VGT R-Line diesel engines.\n\nIn March 2013, the Santa Fe long-wheelbase variant was available in South Korea as the Maxcruz.\n\nAs per Hyundai's website, the Hyundai Santa Fe and Santa Fe Sport are available in multiple trim levels:\n\nThe Santa Fe Sport is available in one basic trim level, but with two engines, and multiple packages that add many features. Basic equipment includes alloy wheels, an A/M-F/M stereo with CD/MP3 player, iPod/USB and auxiliary audio inputs, SiriusXM Satellite Radio, Bluetooth for phone and audio, voice command, six (6) speakers, cloth seating surfaces, and more. Features such as an upgraded sound system with upgraded touch-screen radio, a full, GPS navigational system, and leather-trimmed seating surfaces can be added to the basic Santa Fe Sport so that buyers can choose their ideal vehicle. Engine choices are either a 2.4L Gasoline Direct-Injection (GDi) Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine, or a 2.0L Turbocharged Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine, offered as the 2.4 and 2.0T trim levels, respectively.\n\nThe Santa Fe is available in two distinct trim levels: the SE (Formerly called the GLS until the 2016 model year), and the Limited. The SE includes alloy wheels, an A/M-F/M stereo with CD/MP3 player, iPod/USB and auxiliary audio inputs, SiriusXM Satellite Radio, Bluetooth for phone and audio, voice command, six (6) speakers, cloth seating surfaces, and more. Features such as an upgraded sound system with upgraded touch-screen radio, a full, GPS navigational system, and leather-trimmed seating surfaces can be added to the Santa Fe SE to further enhance this trim level. The Limited adds those features that are optional on the SE, while adding larger alloy wheels and wood interior trim. The Santa Fe is only available with the 3.3L V6 engine.\n\nFor the 2014 model year, blind spot monitoring became available on all trims, and Technology Package added rear parking assistance, cooled front seats, and memory front seats. Rear window sunshades were added to the Premium Package.\n\nFor the 2017 model, both the LWB Santa Fe and Santa Fe Sport has received a facelift with restyled headlights and taillights.\nAs part of the Super Bowl XLVII campaign, 3 TV commercials developed by INNOCEAN USA were premiered during Super Bowl XLVII:\n\nOn February 21, 2018, Hyundai introduced the fourth-generation Santa Fe in South Korea, followed by the Geneva Motor Show in March. The fourth-generation Santa Fe is a two-row SUV which succeeds the previous Santa Fe Sport model. The new Santa Fe arrived in North American dealerships starting in the summer of 2018 as a 2019 model.\n\nThe previous three-row, long-wheelbase Santa Fe continues into model year 2019 rebranded as the Santa Fe XL. Its replacement, the Palisade, debuted in 2018 as a 2020 model.\n\nA diesel fuel version of the Santa Fe was made available in the United States for the 2019 model year. In Europe, three engines are offered: a 2-litre diesel (152 or 180 hp), a 2.2-litre diesel (197 hp) and a 2.4 litre petrol engine (185 hp). The engines will be offered with 6- or 8-speed automatic transmissions.\n\nThe Chinese market fourth generation Hyundai Santa Fe was introduced in 2019 (called \"Shengda\" (胜达) in Chinese), featuring a restyled rear end similar to the eighth generation Hyundai Sonata. The Chinese version is shorter than the international version, while featuring a longer wheelbase.\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 28, 1999. In the episode, Homer wins a Harley-Davidson motorcycle and starts his own outlaw motorcycle club, naming it \"Hell's Satans\". However, this attracts the real club called \"Hell's Satans\" to crash at their house. After a while, they begin to appreciate Marge, who takes care of them, and kidnap her. Homer tracks them down and scuffles with Meathook, the leader of the gang. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Neil Affleck, and features several guest appearances.\n\nAfter viewing an advertisement on TV, the family visits the 1950s-themed Greasers Cafe where Homer and Marge win a dancing contest. Their prize is a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, awarded by \"Wolfguy Jack\" just 3 days before the restaurant goes out of business. After Bart educates Homer on riding a motorcycle (which Homer enjoys), he forms an outlaw motorcycle club named the Hell's Satans with Moe, Lenny, Carl, and even Ned Flanders, even though Ned rides a bicycle, Lenny rides a lawnmower, and Moe's motorcycle is old. They get in trouble all across Springfield, until Homer is confronted by another outlaw motorcycle club named the Hell's Satans, which are based in Bakersfield.\n\nThe true Hell's Satans arrive and punish Homer, by forcing him to eat all his Hell's Satans apparel, for using their name. Then the group—led by two men named Meathook and Ramrod—start living at the Simpson house, generally being destructive and intimidating the Simpson family. Fortunately, Marge is able to clean up after the gang and take care of them, which they come to appreciate. One day, the Hell's Satans leave — and take Marge with them, later assuring her she is safe because none of them find her sexually attractive (Marge is first surprised because she thought Ramrod was attracted to her, then both relieved and saddened she is not desired by the gang). Homer goes after them, and tracks the Hell's Satans — and Marge — to a campsite. After a fight with Meathook, Homer wins back Marge. The two of them say goodbye to the gang, who plan to take advice given to them by Marge and find normal jobs. Homer returns with Marge to a biker bar where he had earlier been repeatedly beaten up, and leaves with a Duff keg.\n\n\"Take My Wife, Sleaze\" was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Neil Affleck as part of the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\" (1999–2000). Guest starring in the episode were John Goodman as Meathook, Henry Winkler as Ramrod, Jay North as himself, NRBQ as themselves, and Jan Hooks as Manjula. NRBQ drummer Tom Ardolino said in an interview before \"Take My Wife, Sleaze\" aired that the band's appearance is \"real quick. We're in a bar that Homer goes in looking for Marge. We're the band playing in the bar.\" Bass player Joey Spampinato commented, \"We got to sit around the table when they read the script and it was pretty funny stuff.\" In addition to appearing in the episode, NRBQ performed the \"Simpsons\" theme music over the closing credits. Executive producer Mike Scully considers NRBQ to be one of his favorite bands, and their songs had already been used in three episodes of the show that aired not long before this episode was produced.\n\nThe name of Homer's gang, the Hell's Satans, is a reference to the real-life motorcycle gang and organized crime syndicate Hells Angels. Authors Paul Broughton and Linda Walker analyzed the episode in their 2009 book \"Motorcycling and Leisure: Understanding the Recreational PTW Rider\", writing: \"This episode feeds on the stereotypical image of riders, for example, Homer says: 'Yeah, that's the life for me, Marge. Cruising and hassling shopkeepers.' The outlaw image is further reinforced within this episode when another group of bikers, also called the Hell's Satans, take offence at Homer using the name. This gang act in a stereotypical gang manner, wrecking Homer's house and kidnapping his wife. The fact that an iconic cartoon series can use such stereotypical images of riders to good effect demonstrates how much the negative rider image is ingrained within society.\"\n\nOther references to popular culture include to the 1938 film \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\". Homer's motorcycle sword fight with Meathook parodies the ending sword fight between Robin and Guy of Gisbourne in the film. Wolfguy Jack is a parody of radio host Wolfman Jack; his girlfriend resembles Debbie from the film \"American Graffiti\". When Apu shoos Homer from the Kwik-E-Mart with a broom, he and Manjula adopt a stance reminiscent of Grant Wood’s painting, American Gothic.\n\nThe episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 28, 1999. On October 7, 2008, it was released on DVD as part of the box set \"The Simpsons – The Complete Eleventh Season\". Staff members Mike Scully, George Meyer, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Julia Thacker, Dan Castellaneta, and Neil Affleck participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set. \n\nWhile reviewing the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\", DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented: \"Should we blame ['Take My Wife, Sleaze'] for the movie \"Wild Hogs\"? Maybe not, but the episode doesn’t do a lot to rise above the level of that John Travolta mediocrity. I like guest stars Henry Winkler and John Goodman, so the episode’s not a loss, but it’s not a winner either.\"\n\n"}

During the Langobardian era, Arogno expanded into a major fortified garrison. In 859 the monastery of S. Ambrogio in Milan was listed as the owner of property in Arogno. On 24 February 1798, the village joined the Republic of Riva San Vitale. Starting in 1797-98 there were repeated territorial conflict with Campione d'Italia, which were not settled until 1861.\n\nThe parish church of S. Stefano (originally S. Nicolao) is first mentioned in 810. In 1581 it broke from the Mother Church of Riva San Vitale to form a parish. Between 1591 and the late 17th Century the Ursulines had a house in Arogno. East of the village is the romanesque Chapel of S. Michael, which was rebuilt in the Baroque style.\n\nThe local economy depended on agriculture and animal husbandry, as well as revenue from successful emigrants (mostly working in construction). For a short time, there was a small coal mining industry in the municipality. In 1873 and 1888, two factories for the manufacture of components for watches, opened in Arogno. For decades these were the major industries in the municipality. Today, much of the population works in the services sector or commutes to neighboring cities.\n\nArogno is located on a high plateau in the Val Mara, about from the Italian border near the enclave of Campione.

{"id": "1887415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887415", "title": "William Lambton", "text": "William Lambton\n\nLieutenant-Colonel William Lambton, FRS (c. 1753 – 20 or 26th January 1823) was a British soldier, surveyor, and geographer who began a triangulation survey in 1800-1802 that was later called the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India. His initial survey was to measure the length of a degree of an arc of the meridian so as to establish the shape of the earth and support a larger scale trigonometrical survey across the width of the peninsula of India between Madras and Mangalore. After triangulating across the peninsula, he continued surveys northwards for more than twenty years. He died during the course of the surveys in central India and is buried at Hinganghat in Wardha district of Maharashtra. He was succeeded by his assistant George Everest.\n\nLambton was born around 1753 at Crosby Grange, near Northallerton, in North Yorkshire, the son of a farmer. He was extremely reserved about the details of his family. Even the year of birth is speculated on the basis of an incident he recounted of a dinner in Madikeri in 1803 hosted by Veer Rajender Wadeer, the ruler of the province of Coorg. The Coorg Raja made all present declare their age and Lambton is said to have mentioned his as fifty. For many years he spent a substantial portion of his salary to support his parents from which it has been suggested that he came from humble origins. He often mentioned a mathematics teacher at school by the name of Emerson. His skill in mathematics earned him a place in a grammar school at Northallerton, and he studied under Dr. Charles Hutton.\n\nOn 28 March 1781, Lambton was appointed ensign in Lord Fauconberg's regiment of foot, and transferred to the 33rd Regiment of Foot. He was commissioned in the 33rd Regiment, and his ability at surveying led to work on measuring land for settlers in America. He spent most of his earning to support his parents. With his regiment he took part in the American War of Independence and was taken prisoner at Yorktown. Observing a solar eclipse through the telescope of a theodolite without darkened glasses led to the burning of the retina of his left eye. After this accident he obtained with the help of his friends, especially Sir Brook Watson, an appointment as barrack-master in New Brunswick with a salary of 400 pounds per year. He had considerable leisure during which he was able to lay, in his words, \"\"...the foundation of that knowledge, which was one day to bring him to the notice of the world\".\" He was appointed barrack master in Nova Scotia and he spent many years studying mathematics on his own. In 1795 the Duke of York ordered that all civilian officers should be struck off from the regiments. Lambton then joined the 33rd at Calcutta after 13 years away from regimental duties. The 33rd Regiment was commanded by Sir Arthur Wellesley at Calcutta.\n\nIn 1796, he was promoted to Lieutenant and posted with his regiment to India, under the leadership of Colonel Arthur Wellesley. He took part in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War in 1799. He was a brigade major during the Siege of Seringapatam where he led the left column after the fall of his superiors. He was also able to demonstrate his skills in navigating by the stars during the campaign by pointing out to General Baird that he was headed in the wrong direction while attempting to around Tipu's camp at night. After the capture of Mysore Lambton proposed to Wellesley that the territory be surveyed, using the new techniques of geodesy employed by William Roy in Great Britain. Lambton's proposal to conduct the survey was nearly shot down by Major James Rennel who declared that it was not needed since Colonel Colin Mackenzie was already undertaking a similar survey. The proposal was however examined by Nevil Maskelyne, Astronomer Royal and a relative of Lord Clive. Maskelyne saw the scientific value of the survey and pointed out to Rennel that he had been misinformed and gave his support to the project. Just around the time that Lambton got his survey approved by Lord Clive, he happened to hear of some instruments being carried back from China by astronomer Dr. James Dinwiddie. A set of instruments had been sent to China along with Dr Dinwiddie but the Chinese Emperor had not shown interest and the equipment was returned. Lambton was able to examine the instruments when Dinwiddie broke journey at Fort William. The instruments included a zenith sector (an upward pointing telescope with measuring instruments) of 5 ft radius, a Ramsden chain, leveling instrument, and a chronometer. Lambton also ordered an altitude and azimuth circle with a theodolite. The equipment arrived in 1801. Although a baseline was measured in Bangalore between October and December 1800, this appears to have been rejected (it was not connected to the triangulations) and another baseline was made in 1804 (using better equipment and on better terrain) to compare with the Madras baseline whose measurement began on 10 April 1802 from St. Thomas Mount and was completed with seven and a half miles measured by 22 May 1802. They then triangulated their way to Bangalore where the 1804 baseline was measured by John Warren to check the survey accuracy. The triangulation extended west to end at Mangalore. In 1806 he began his latitudinal measurement 100 miles northwards from Bangalore, where the British territory ended. He then surveyed southwards to Cape Comorin. Lambton then recommenced the survey northwards until his death. He died at Hinganghat, and the exact date of death is not known but is either 20th as recorded by most contemporary newspapers or 26 January 1823. A memorial was erected by the Resident of Nagpur, Richard Jenkins.\n\nLambton had three acknowledged children through an Indian mistress named Kumerboo. One of them was also named William Lambton while another possibly died in infancy. He had another daughter and son through another woman Frances, possibly a Franco-Indian or Anglo-Indian. William Lambton junior joined the Survey in 1815.\n\nAround the time that Lambton proposed a triangulation survey of the Peninsula of India, Colonel Colin Mackenzie had already begun a topographical survey of the Mysore region. Mackenzie was later designated as the Surveyor General. Lambton, with his support from Lord Clive, however did not have to report to Mackenzie and it has been suggested that Mackenzie felt undermined. Their correspondence however showed cordial relations being maintained. The triangulation survey was officially given the name of Great Trigonometrical Survey only in 1818.\nLambton essentially followed a system established in England by General Roy for the Principal Triangulation of Great Britain. Lambton's initial aim was to measure the arc of a meridian so as to establish the shape of the earth. Lambton did not wish to assume any specific theoretical shape and preferred to make exact measurements. In the earliest surveys conducted in Bangalore he noted:\nThe Bangalore baseline of 1800 made use of a chain laid in long coffers supported on pickets and the heads were aligned using a telescope. The ground chosen was not appropriate and this early baseline measurement had to be dropped. The equipment needed for careful survey arrived only in 1801. The subsequent baselines including were made more carefully with the use of a Ramsden's chain specially calibrated for tropical temperatures, a boning telescope for angle measurements and linear alignment. A Ramsden chain consisting of 40 links of 2.5 feet each and measuring 100 feet at 62° Fahrenheit. He took special precautions to account for the expansion of the chain under the Indian weather; and repeated measurements with rotations of the telescope of the Zenith sector so as to account for collimation errors in determining the latitude (the elevation of the pole star directly provides the latitude but owing to errors related to determining the horizon and from refraction, the preferred method in surveying was to use well known stars located closer to the zenith, such as Aldebaran for India, whose declination from the pole-star had been pre-established. Lambton's assistant John Warren investigated the effect of refraction on errors in calculating the latitudes.). \n\nThe main survey instrument from 1802 for the primary triangles was a Great Theodolite made by William Cary. This was very similar to the instruments used in France and Britain for previous trigonometrical surveys. It had a horizontal circle that was 36 inches wide and the readings were taken using a microscope. The vertical graduated circle was 18 inches in diameter. It weighed about half a ton and needed twelve men to carry it. Lambton measured all three angles of triangles in several cases to establish the spherical excess (angles of triangles on a sphere sum up greater than 180°). When the survey was carried out from Madras to Bangalore, Lambton was able to compare the Bangalore baseline of 1804 with the calculated measurements and the difference was about three and a half inches.\n\nLambton was made a Fellow of the Royal Society (9 January 1817) and a corresponding member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1817. A narrow ridge above the Bhavani valley along the Nilgiris is named after him as Lambton's Peak Range. A commemorative bust is placed at St. Thomas Mount, Chennai, India.\n\n"}

ATK, East Bengal and Mohun Bagan currently use the Salt Lake Stadium for most of their home games.\n\nThe stadium's record attendance was recorded in 1997 when 131,781 spectators watched the Federation Cup semifinal between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan.\n\nThe stadium recently switched back to natural grass from artificial turf as part of the preparations for hosting the U-17 World Cup in 2017. The new turf was unveiled in a Kolkata Derby match between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan during the 2015–16 Calcutta Premier Division match.\n\nThe stadium was established in 1984 because the club grounds in the Maidan area, each with capacity around 20,000, were proving too small for the huge crowd that occupied the grounds on matchdays. And while the Eden Gardens was there to handle some of the bigger games, like the Kolkata Derby, the pressure of handling both cricket and football was proving to be a bit too much for the stadium.\n\nThe stadium is situated approximately 10 kilometres to the east of the Kolkata downtown. The roof is made of metal tubes and aluminum sheets and concrete. The stadium was inaugurated in January 1984. There are two electronic scoreboards and control rooms. There is illumination at night . There are special arrangements for TV broadcasting.\n\nThe gigantic stadium features three tiers of concrete galleries. The stadium has 9 entry gates and 30 ramps for the spectators to reach the viewing blocks. The nine gates include the VIP gate. The gates 1 and 2 are on kadapara road, gate no.3, 3A, 4, 4A and 4B are on the side of Broadway; gate no 5 and the VIP gate are on the side of EM By pass. The ramps are inside the stadium and link the inner ring road to the different levels of the stadium complex.\n\nThe stadium covers an area of . The stadium has a unique synthetic track for athletic meets. It has a main football arena measuring . It also houses electronics scoreboards, elevators, VIP enclosures, peripheral floodlighting arrangement from the roof-top, air-conditioned VIP rest room, conference hall and much more. The stadium has its own water arrangements and standby diesel generation sets.\n\nThe renovation project started in February 2015. The artificial turf at the stadium has been replaced by an all-natural grass pitch. The new grass is from Reivera Bermuda seeds procured from the USA and below it there are two layers of sand and gravel. The next layer is fitted with perforated pipes so that water-logging won’t be an issue.\n\nGerman company Porplastic provided the elastic coating for the running track around the pitch which was replaced for the first time since the stadium was built in 1984. The old track has been scooped out and the new surface was laid.\n\nThe lobby of the VIP entrance that leads to the player's arena, was air-conditioned. The broadcast rooms and stadium offices were renovated.\n\nBucket seats replaced the concrete benches in the galleries, which brought down the stadium's capacity from 120,000 to 85,000.\n\nThe VIP and press boxes, both in the middle tier, were pulled down and a new press box with a capacity of 240 seats is now on the third tier. The VIP box remained on the second tier, with an added 240 seats. The press conference room that used to be cramped during derbies and matches featuring international teams has been shifted to a 19 x 8.5-metre space under a gallery. A spacious broadcast room of similar dimensions has been \nbuilt as well.\n\nTwo full-sized practice grounds with perforations on the surface for underground drainage and eight floodlight towers have come up at the Hyatt end of the stadium, as recommended by FIFA. The same imported Reveria Bermuda grass used on the main turf will cover the practice grounds. The drainage network has been designed to ensure that the surface never becomes slushy. The referees rooms have been built alongside the practice grounds.\n\nThe number of gates to the stadium has been increased from seven to nine. Some of the existing gates has been widened too, as are the approaches that connect the entrances and exits to the ring road. Each link road is 21 meters wide. The surroundings has been beautified by the forest department.\n\nTo the left of the lobby, rooms have been constructed for referees and ball boys.\n\nThe stadium is located in the satellite township of Salt Lake in North 24 Parganas and it also lies beside the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass which makes it easily accessible by road.\n\nThere are numerous buses which ply around the city to the stadium. The Line 2 of the Kolkata Metro is passing near the stadium, therefore the stadium has its own station, opened on 13 February 2020 . The stadium is approx away from N.S.C.Bose International Airport.\n\nAfter its inauguration in January, 1984 with the Jawaharlal Nehru International Gold Cup, the Salt Lake Stadium has hosted several important international tournaments and matches such as matches of the 1986 FIFA World Cup qualification in 1985, Super-Soccers in 1986, 1989, 1991 and 1994, 3rd South Asian Games in 1987, USSR Festival Cup in 1988, Charminar Challenger Trophy in 1992 and the Jawaharlal Nehru International Gold Cup in 1995.\n\nThe Salt Lake Stadium hosts the home games of the local clubs Mohun Bagan and East Bengal who play in the I-League. It also hosts the games of Mohammedan, who currently play in the 2nd Division I-League. Many of the home games of the Indian Team are also played in the Salt Lake Stadium. Since 2014 a new tenant team Atlético de Kolkata (playing in the ISL) has made the stadium their home ground.\n\nOn June 5, 2011 FIFA scheduled a friendly match to be played at the Salt Lake on 2 September 2011. The match was played between Argentina and Venezuela. This was a historic occasion in the history of Indian football and also for the stadium as the match featured Argentine superstar Lionel Messi.\nThe stadium has also hosted Oliver Kahn's official farewell match for Bayern Munich when they played a friendly match against Mohun Bagan. Bayern Munich won the match 3–0.\nIn December 2012, a friendly match was played between Brazil Masters and IFA All Stars. Brazil Masters won it 3–1. Beto scored twice and Bebeto scored one goal for Brazil Masters.\n\nOn 12 October 2014, the stadium hosted the first match in the Indian Super League, preceded by an opening ceremony which featured superstars from the footballing world as well as from Bollywood. In the opening match, Atlético de Kolkata defeated Mumbai City FC 3–0. The stadium hosted its last match of the inaugural edition of ISL on 14 December where Atlético de Kolkata played FC Goa in the first leg of the semi-finals. Salt Lake stadium was the only stadium among the eight venues of ISL where matches were allowed to be played on artificial turf. It hosted 11 matches in 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup, including the Final. It will be used again for the 2020 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup including the quarter-finals.\n\nThe stadium also hosts important athletic events. It has hosted the SAF Games in 1987 and various national athletics events in India. The stadium also hosts different kinds of cultural programs such as dance and music concerts. The stadium also hosted the opening ceremony of 2013 IPL Season.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1887427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887427", "title": "Rampage World Tour", "text": "Rampage World Tour\n\nRampage World Tour is a video game released in 1997 and is the second game in the \"Rampage\" series. The game was developed as an arcade game for Midway Games by Game Refuge Inc. designers Brian Colin and Jeff Nauman, who conceived and designed the original in 1986. It was ported to the Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64, Game Boy Color, PlayStation, Microsoft Windows and has been re-released on \"Midway Arcade Treasures 2\" as well as being included in \"\".\n\nGeorge, Lizzie, and Ralph have been released due to an explosion at a Scumlabs facility. The trio begin to destroy all of Scumlabs' bases scattered throughout the world and kill its employees. In the last levels, Scumlabs CEO Eustace DeMonic turns himself into a monster in an attempt to combat George, Lizzie, and Ralph, but is defeated during a battle on a lunar base. After this, the only surviving Scumlabs employee Dr. Elizabeth Veronica tries to disintegrate the monsters with a ray gun on her spaceship, but it only shrinks them to a miniature size, and they wind up inside her ship. George and Ralph pose on the shelves, while Lizzie bounces atop of Veronica's breasts (though the latter portion is censored on home ports.)\n\nLike in the first \"Rampage\" game, the goal of every stage is to destroy all the buildings in each city while avoiding or destroying the military forces. If the player takes too long in destroying the city, jets will fly in and bomb the remaining buildings, ending the stage with a lower score.\n\nIn the first level, Peoria, a tourism billboard cycles through different regions in the country (Northeast, Southwest, etc.). Destroying the billboard when it is showing one of these regions will send the player in that direction. Players may also choose to eat or ignore the \"World Tour\" power-ups and control which country they can visit. After getting a World Tour power-up, the next few levels take place in a foreign location until a Scumlabs plant is destroyed. Purple radioactive waste temporarily transforms the player into a super monster known as V.E.R.N. The game will not end until every Scumlabs city has been destroyed, which may cause some erratic traveling around towards the end of the game (including multiple world tour trips if the players have missed or purposely kept from getting world tour flags).\n\nThe arcade version supports up to three players simultaneously. Though it was announced that the PlayStation version would also support three players, both the PlayStation and Saturn versions allow only two players. Three player support apparently was programmed into the port at one point and pulled at the last minute, since a review of the PlayStation version in \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" describes three player gameplay. The Nintendo 64 conversion includes full three-player functionality.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the arcade version of the game. They derided the decision to continue using sprites for the graphics instead of polygons, concluding that \"\"Rampage World Tour\" seems aimed at satisfying gamers' yearning for past titles like \"Space Invaders\" or \"Pac-Man\". Fair enough, but all this remake will accomplish is to make gamers yearn for the original more than ever.\"\n\nCritics agreed that the console ports are nearly arcade-perfect, though some criticized the PlayStation and Saturn versions for supporting only two players instead of the three supported in the arcade version. However, they were divided about the game itself. Many hailed it as a fun revival of an arcade classic. For example, Shawn Smith wrote in \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" that \"There's nothing like sitting down and playing a good old-time game. It's even better to do it when it has been enhanced, but still has the same feel as the original.\" Despite giving the PlayStation version a score of only 5.7 out of 10, Jeff Gerstmann highly recommended the game due to its new gameplay tricks and larger levels, and said the only possible way to improve on it would be with three-player support. However, the majority criticized the game's 2D sidescrolling format as antiquated, and some further remarked that the simplicity and repetitiveness of the \"Rampage\" gameplay, while highly enjoyable in arcades, was not suited to the home console format. Adam Douglas explained in \"IGN\" that the \"Rampage\" series \"was great for getting your aggressions out and then moving on. Why would you want to play this game for hours at a time?\" \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" similarly held that \"The coin-op was a great laugh for about ten minutes or so, but the lack of variety in the level design and the shallow nature of the gameplay meant that it soon grew quite tiresome. Despite the meagre improvements to the update, the very same criticisms can be levelled at \"Rampage World Tour\".\"\n\nIn a review of the PlayStation version, \"GamePro\" was more undecided: \"With plenty of special moves and power-ups to discover as you lay waste to more than 100 cities, the gameplay certainly lasts - just don't expect it to change much. Then again, sometimes it's good to turn off your brain and turn up the cosmic carnage.\" However, a different \"GamePro\" critic reviewed the Saturn version, and opined that the game's \"utter failure to take advantage of new technology and add new elements to the original \"Rampage\" is inexcusable.\" \"Next Generation\" reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game, and stated that \"Despite the three-player mode, no amount of graphic flash or nostalgia can improve a style of gameplay whose day has passed.\"\n\nCharles Ardai of \"Computer Gaming World\" noted that the PC port of the game had performance and graphics issues when played in full-screen mode. The best performance was achieved when the screen was set to a postcard-sized frame. He found the action to be basic, although there is a variety of animation. He added that it is \"suffused with all the monster movie fun that was conspicuously lacking in the recent \"Godzilla\" film\".\n"}

The stadium is named after Sukarno, the 1st President of Indonesia. It is mostly used for football matches.\n\nWhen first opened prior to the 1962 Asian Games, the stadium had a seating capacity of 110,000. It has been reduced twice during renovations: first to 88,306 in 2006 for the 2007 AFC Asian Cup and then to 77,193 single seats as part of renovations for the 2018 Asian Games and Asian Para Games, where it hosted the ceremonies and athletics competitions.\n\nConstruction began on 8 February 1960 and finished on 21 July 1962, in time to host the following month's Asian Games. Its construction was partially funded through a special loan from the Soviet Union. The stadium's original capacity of 110,000 people was reduced to 88,306 as a result of renovations for the 2007 AFC Asian Cup. The stadium is well-known for its ring-shaped facade, the \"temu gelang\", which was designed to shade spectators from the sun, and increase the grandeur of the stadium.\n\nAlthough the stadium is popularly known as Gelora Bung Karno Stadium (\"Stadion Gelora Bung Karno\") or \"GBK\" Stadium, its official name is Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium (\"Stadion Utama Gelora Bung Karno\"), as there are other stadiums in the Gelora Bung Karno Sports Complex, such as the Sports Palace and the secondary stadium. It was known as Senajan (EYD: Senayan) Main Stadium from its opening through the 1962 Asiad until the complex's name was changed to Gelora Bung Karno by a Presidential Decree issued on 24 September 1962, twenty days after the games ended. During the New Order era, the complex was renamed \"Gelora Senayan Complex\" and the stadium was renamed \"Gelora Senayan Main Stadium\" in 1969 under the \"de-Sukarnoization\" policy by then-President Suharto. After the fall of the dictatorship, the complex name was reverted by President Abdurrahman Wahid in a decree effective since 17 January 2001.\n\nThe stadium served as the main venue of the 2018 Asian Games and Asian Para Games, hosting the ceremonies and athletics. It underwent renovations in preparation for the events; to comply with FIFA standards, all of the stadium's existing seating was replaced, including its remaining bleachers, making it an all-seater with a capacity of 77,193. The new seats are coloured in red, white, and grey—resembling a waving flag of Indonesia. A new, brighter LED lighting system was also installed, with 620 fixtures, and an RGB lighting system was installed on the stadium's facade. Improvements were also made to the stadium's accessibility.\n\nGBK Stadium hosted the 2007 Asian Cup final between Iraq and Saudi Arabia and is projected to host the final match of the 2021 FIFA U-20 World Cup. Other competitions held there are several Tiger Cup finals and domestic cup finals.\n\n\nOther than sports, the stadium is also used for other events such as national ceremonies, political gatherings, admission exams, religious affairs, concerts, etc. Notable events include:\n\nKRL Commuterline providing the service through Palmerah railway station, within walking distance from the compound while Jakarta MRT provide the service through Istora Mandiri station. Two corridors of Transjakarta BRT also serving this area. An extension of currently under-construction Greater Jakarta LRT also planned to serve the western perimeter of the compound.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1887433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887433", "title": "Visual phototransduction", "text": "Visual phototransduction\n\nVisual phototransduction is the sensory transduction of the visual system. It is a process by which light is converted into electrical signals in the rod cells, cone cells and photosensitive ganglion cells of the retina of the eye. This cycle was elucidated by George Wald (1906–1997) for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1967. It is so called \"Wald's Visual Cycle\" after him.\n\nThe visual cycle is the biological conversion of a photon into an electrical signal in the retina. This process occurs via G-protein coupled receptors called opsins which contain the chromophore 11-cis retinal. 11-cis retinal is covalently linked to the opsin receptor via Schiff base forming retinylidene protein. When struck by a photon, 11-cis retinal undergoes photoisomerization to all-trans retinal which changes the conformation of the opsin GPCR leading to signal transduction cascades which causes closure of cyclic GMP-gated cation channel, and hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor cell.\n\nFollowing isomerization and release from the opsin protein, all-trans retinal is reduced to all-trans retinol and travels back to the retinal pigment epithelium to be \"recharged\". It is first esterified by lecithin retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) and then converted to 11-cis retinol by the isomerohydrolase RPE65. The isomerase activity of RPE65 has been shown; it is still uncertain whether it also acts as hydrolase. Finally, it is oxidized to 11-cis retinal before traveling back to the rod outer segment where it is again conjugated to an opsin to form new, functional visual pigment (rhodopsin).\n\nThe photoreceptor cells involved in vision are the rods and cones. These cells contain a chromophore (11-cis retinal, the aldehyde of Vitamin A1 and light-absorbing portion) bound to cell membrane protein, opsin. Rods deal with low light level and do not mediate color vision. Cones, on the other hand, can code the color of an image through comparison of the outputs of the three different types of cones. Each cone type responds best to certain wavelengths, or colors, of light because each type has a slightly different opsin. The three types of cones are L-cones, M-cones and S-cones that respond optimally to long wavelengths (reddish color), medium wavelengths (greenish color), and short wavelengths (bluish color) respectively. Humans have a trichromatic visual system consisting of three unique systems, rods, mid and long-wavelength sensitive (red and green) cones and short wavelength sensitive (blue) cones.\n\nTo understand the photoreceptor's behaviour to light intensities, it is necessary to understand the roles of different currents.\n\nThere is an ongoing outward potassium current through nongated K-selective channels. This outward current tends to hyperpolarize the photoreceptor at around -70 mV (the equilibrium potential for K).\n\nThere is also an inward sodium current carried by cGMP-gated sodium channels. This so-called 'dark current' depolarizes the cell to around -40 mV. Note that this is significantly more depolarized than most other neurons.\n\nA high density of Na-K pumps enables the photoreceptor to maintain a steady intracellular concentration of Na and K.\n\nPhotoreceptor cells are unusual cells in that they depolarize in response to absence of stimuli or scotopic conditions (darkness). In photopic conditions (light), photoreceptors hyperpolarize to a potential of -60mV.\n\nIn the dark, cGMP levels are high and keep cGMP-gated sodium channels open allowing a steady inward current, called the dark current. This dark current keeps the cell depolarized at about -40 mV, leading to glutamate release which inhibits excitation of neurons.\n\nThe depolarization of the cell membrane in scotopic conditions opens voltage-gated calcium channels. An increased intracellular concentration of Ca causes vesicles containing glutamate, a neurotransmitter, to merge with the cell membrane, therefore releasing glutamate into the synaptic cleft, an area between the end of one cell and the beginning of another neuron. Glutamate, though usually excitatory, functions here as an inhibitory neurotransmitter.\n\nIn the cone pathway glutamate:\n\nIn summary: \"Light\" closes cGMP-gated sodium channels, reducing the influx of both Na and Ca ions. Stopping the influx of Na ions effectively switches \"off\" the dark current. Reducing this dark current causes the photoreceptor to \"hyperpolarise\", which reduces glutamate release which thus reduces the \"inhibition\" of retinal nerves, leading to \"excitation\" of these nerves. This reduced Ca influx during phototransduction enables deactivation and recovery from phototransduction, as discussed in Visual phototransduction#Deactivation of the phototransduction cascade.\n\n\nIn light, low cGMP levels close Na+ and Ca2+ channels, reducing intracellular Na+ and Ca2+. \nDuring recovery (dark adaptation), the low Ca2+ levels induce recovery (termination of the phototransduction cascade), as follows:\n\n\nIn more detail:\n\nGTPase Accelerating Protein (GAP) interacts with the alpha subunit of transducin, and causes it to hydrolyse its bound GTP to GDP, and thus halts the action of phosphodiesterase, stopping the transformation of cGMP to GMP.\n\nIn other words: Guanylate Cyclase Activating Protein (GCAP) is a calcium binding protein, and as the calcium levels in the cell have decreased, GCAP dissociates from its bound calcium ions, and interacts with Guanylate Cyclase, activating it. Guanylate Cyclase then proceeds to transform GTP to cGMP, replenishing the cell's cGMP levels and thus reopening the sodium channels that were closed during phototransduction.\n\nFinally, Metarhodopsin II is deactivated. Recoverin, another calcium binding protein, is normally bound to Rhodopsin Kinase when calcium is present. When the calcium levels fall during phototransduction, the calcium dissociates from recoverin, and rhodopsin kinase is released, when it (\"what?\") proceeds to phosphorylate metarhodopsin II, which decreases its affinity for transducin. Finally, arrestin, another protein, binds the phosphorylated metarhodopsin II, completely deactivating it. Thus, finally, phototransduction is deactivated, and the dark current and glutamate release is restored. It is this pathway, where Metarhodopsin II is phosphorylated and bound to arrestin and thus deactivated, which is thought to be responsible for the S2 component of dark adaptation. The S2 component represents a linear section of the dark adaptation function present at the beginning of dark adaptation for all bleaching intensities.\n\nAll-\"trans\" retinal is transported to the pigment epithelial cells to be reduced to all-\"trans\" retinol, the precursor to 11-\"cis\" retinal. This is then transported back to the rods. All-\"trans\" retinal cannot be synthesised by humans and must be supplied by vitamin A in the diet. Deficiency of all-\"trans\" retinal can lead to night blindness. This is part of the bleach and recycle process of retinoids in the photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium.\n\nPhototransduction process in invertebrates like the fruit fly is different from the vertebrates. PI(4,5)P cycle underlies the phototransduction process. Here, light induces the conformational change into Rhodopsin and converts it into meta-rhodopsin. This helps in dissociation of G -protein complex. Alpha sub-unit of this complex activates the PLC enzyme (PLC-beta) which hydrolyze the PIP2 into DAG. This hydrolysis leads to opening of TRP channels and influx of calcium.\n\n\n"}

The belts can be used as medical restraints in institutions for bed and wheelchair restraints, and for safety in activities such as abseiling or construction work. When they are used in sexual bondage plays they are commonly referred to as bondage belts, and also worn in fetish clothing. The belts are usually fastened with buckles and some by a locking mechanism, which enables quick release.\n\nHistorically body belts were used as a personal fall arrest system but OSHA rule changes meant they ceased to be acceptable for such use from 1 January 1998.\n\nWhen transporting prisoners, leather or nylon belts are often used instead of belly chains to secure the prisoner's arms at waist level. These restraint belts have a metal ring on the front, through which the handcuffs are plugged and then put on the detainee's wrists. The belt is then placed around the detainee's waist and secured with a buckle; some models can also be locked with a padlock. \n\nFor further control, a stun belt may be fastened around the prisoner's waist. In the case of misbehaviour, the device may give the subject an electric shock.\n\nFor sexual bondage plays a body belt is usually called a bondage belt. Though it is not a physical restraint by itself, it can be used to provide an anchoring point for other restraints, such as bondage cuffs, rope, etc. Lengths of simple leather strapping with buckles are sometimes also referred to as bondage belts, because they can be used quickly to bind limbs. \n\nMost bondage belts are made of fabric or leather as these materials tend to be more comfortable and better distribute pressure over the skin.\n\nLeather bondage belts have been worn as a fashion accessory by subcultures such as punks and goths. Sid Vicious has been cited for popularising the item in alternative fashion.\n"}

When he was three years old his family moved to the Isle of Man, an island which was often a source of inspiration for the composer. His two older brothers were also musicians: Harry (1868-1939) was a violinist, composer and conductor known as \"Manxland's King of Music\", while Daniel S Wood (1872-1927) was principal flautist with the London Symphony Orchestra from 1910, taught flute at the Royal Academy of Music and composed practice pieces that are still in use today.\n\nIn 1897, at the Royal College of Music, Haydn Wood studied violin with Enrique Fernández Arbós and composition with Charles Villiers Stanford. In 1901, he was soloist at a special concert commemorating the opening of the Royal College of Music's Concert Hall. The concert was attended by Joseph Joachim (who had heard him play before) and Pablo de Sarasate. They were so impressed that they sent him to Brussels for study with the renowned teacher César Thomson. He then embarked on a world tour, accompanying the Canadian soprano Dame Emma Albani and they continued their association for a further eight years.\n\nFrom 1913 he toured extensively with the soprano Dorothy Court whom he married in 1909. During this period he wrote popular songs and contributed to musical comedy productions: for example, he contributed seven numbers to the musical play \"Tina\", which opened at the Royal Adelphi Theatre in London on 2 November 1915, and wrote all the music for \"Cash on Delivery\" at the Palace Theatre in 1917. In 1916, Haydn Wood composed his most popular song, \"Roses of Picardy\" for Dorothy, reportedly selling 50,000 sheet music copies per month and earning a six figure royalty sum The song \"Love's Garden of Roses\" was written in 1915, but didn't become well known until popularised by John McCormack's recording, one of the biggest hits of 1918. Another big success came in 1923 with \"A Brown Bird Singing\". By 1926 he was able to support himself as a full time composer for the first time. From 1939, he served as a director of the Performing Right Society. On the occasion of his 70th birthday he was given a full concert dedicated to his music by the BBC. He died in a London nursing home on 11 March 1959, two weeks before his 77th birthday.\n\nAlongside his 200 or so individual songs and seven song cycles, Haydn Wood was a prolific composer of orchestral music, including 15 suites, nine rhapsodies, eight overtures, three concertante pieces and nearly 50 other works scored for a variety of forces.\n\nHis orchestral pieces were primarily of the \"light music\" style; a well known piece of his is the three-movement \"Fantasy-Concerto\". Another is his \"London Landmarks Suite\", particularly \"Horse Guards, Whitehall\", which was used for many years as the signature tune for the BBC Radio Series Down Your Way. In 2018 the BBC Concert Orchestra issued a new recording of the \"Snapshots of London Suite\" (1948) and premiere recordings of five other suites: \"Egypta\" (1929), \"Three Famous Cinema Stars\" (1929), \"Cities of Romance\" (1937), \"Manx Countryside Sketches\" (1943), and \"Royal Castles\" (1952). The short orchestral work \"Soliloquy\" of 1946 is a miniature of more serious intent.\n\nThe first of Haydn Wood's more extended concert pieces to gain attention was the \"Phantasie Quartet\" which won second prize in the first W W Cobbett chamber music competition of 1905 The Piano Concerto was performed at a Patron’s Fund Concert at Queen’s Hall on 14 July 1909, with soloist Ellen Edwards and Stanford conducting. It received its Proms premiere in 1915, also at Queen's Hall. His Violin Concerto of 1928 was first performed in March 1933, with soloist Antonio Brosa. Wood also wrote a Symphony (1908 - score now lost), and the \"Philharmonic Variations\" for cello and orchestra (1939).\n\nThe Isle of Man and folk tunes from the island inspired Wood's music, resulting in the compositions \"Manx Rhapsody, Rhapsody Mylecharaine, Manx Countryside Sketches, Manx Overture,\" and \"Mannin Veen\". The tone poem (pub. 1933, Manx for \"Dear Isle of Man\") was based on four Manx folk tunes, and is one of two works written originally for wind band by Wood. The work is also occasionally performed in its orchestral version. Choral pieces include the short cantatas for chorus and orchestra \"Lochinvar\" (1912) and \"Ode to Genius\" (1940).\n\n"}

The city is populated by 1,158 inhabitants.\n\nThe population of Guyana is varied and includes native Amerindian people who come from 9 original tribes in the savannahs. There is a mixture of Caribbean heritage as well as African. Few white people of Anglo-Saxon heritage live in Guyana and most are there visiting for scientific research in the savannahs or rain forest or visiting on Christian missionary campaigns. The language is an English-based Caribbean creole. Portuguese is also spoken, mainly by Brazilian immigrants, in addition to the many dialects of the Amerindian tribes.\n\nLethem is part of the Guyanese Rupununi savannah where there are many \"vaqueiros\" (as spoken in the Portuguese language), or cowboys, and ranches.

The bridge links northern Brazil to the roads leading to the Atlantic coastal port of Georgetown, Guyana's capital, which is about 423 kilometers (263 miles) to the north.\n\nWater is often drawn from hand dug wells although there is a community water supply, though it is slightly salted. Bottled, filtered water is common and easily available in stores, even in 5-gallon containers.\n\nThe area's other economic activities are plant and mineral extraction, and tourism. There is a rodeo event during Easter weekend, beginning on Saturday evening, at the Triple R Ranch, with many activities, including bull riding, \"wild cow milking\", greased pig competition, horse racing, horse rodeo (both bareback and with saddle) for men or women, and for cowgirls, \"barrel\" horse races. there's also plenty food, such as chicken- or pork-on-a-stick, sun-back beef, and hot dogs. There are also games, contests and entertainment, including a rope pull between vaqueros, and then vaqueras from Georgetown, competing with area Amerindians.\n\nLethem has an airport (IATA Code: LTM) that connects it to the capital, Georgetown with scheduled air service most weekdays. The airport has a single, 6,194 foot (1,888 meter) paved runway with instrument markings, but no lighting. The runway is oriented at 07/25. The approach to 07 is often flown in Brazilian airspace which begins less than 1 km from the threshold. Scheduled service is provided by Trans Guyana Airways, twice a day, via a twin engine, as well as by Air Services LTD. Persons traveling by air to Lethem should know that there are strict weight restrictions for luggage. Weight, depending on booking, could be restricted to less than 20 pounds. At present, all luggage is weighed when flying to or from Lethem, and there is a small charge per kilo of weight. The airport office is located just south of the western end of the runway.\n\nLethem lies on the Takutu River, which forms the border with Brazil, opposite the Brazilian town of Bonfim. Lethem is the capital of Region 9 and is a hub linking many of the surrounding villages to Georgetown. The Takutu River Bridge over the Takutu River was completed in 2009 It cost USD 5 million and was paid for by Brazil. and is the only road link between the two countries. \nThe newly built bridge is expected to bring Brazilian goods to the Georgetown harbor which would be faster than shipping through Brazilian ports. The town is approximately above sea level.\n\n"}

It is the traditional home venue of major Turkish multi-sport club Fenerbahçe SK. The stadium was inaugurated in 1908 and renovated between 1929 and 1932, 1965 and 1982, and 1999 and 2006. On October 4, 2006, after numerous inspections by UEFA, Ülker Stadium was selected to host the 2009 UEFA Cup Final that went down to history as the last Final of the UEFA Cup football tournament, which was rebranded as the UEFA Europa League starting from the 2009–10 season.\n\nBefore Ülker Stadium was built, the field was known as \"Papazın Çayırı\" (\"The field of the priest\"). The field, however, became the very first football pitch of Turkey, where the first league games of the Istanbul Football League were all held consecutively. In 1908, the local teams in the league needed a regular football field, so this land was leased from the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II for 30 Ottoman gold pounds a year. The total construction cost was 3,000 Ottoman gold pounds. The name was changed to the \"Union Club Field\" after the club which made the highest donation for construction of the ground.\n\nThe \"Union Club Field\" was used by many teams in İstanbul, including the owner, Union Club (which changed its name to \"İttihatspor\" after World War I), Fenerbahçe, Galatasaray, and Beşiktaş. However, it lost its importance when a bigger venue, the Taksim Stadium, was built in 1922, inside the courtyard of the historic \"Taksim Topçu Kışlası\" (Taksim Artillery Barracks), which was located at the present-day Taksim Gezi Parkı (Taksim Park).\n\nİttihatspor (which had close relations with the political İttihat ve Terakki), was forced to sell it to the state, in which Şükrü Saracoğlu was a member of the CHP government. Thus, the ownership of the stadium passed to the state, but the field was immediately leased to Fenerbahçe. Later, on May 27, 1933, Fenerbahçe purchased the stadium from the government when Şükrü Saracoğlu was the President of Fenerbahçe, for either the symbolic amount of 1 TL or the worth of the stadium which was 9,000 TL.\n\nThe name of the field was changed to Fenerbahçe Stadium, and this made Fenerbahçe SK the first football club in Turkey to own their stadium, with the help of the Şükrü Saracoğlu government. In the following years, Fenerbahçe SK renovated the stadium and increased its seating capacity. By the year 1949, Fenerbahçe Stadium was the largest football venue in Turkey, with a seating capacity of 25,000.\n\nThe name of the stadium was changed once more in 1998, becoming Fenerbahçe Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium, named after Fenerbahçe's legendary chairman and Turkey's 5th Prime Minister Şükrü Saracoğlu. In 1999, the latest round of renovations and capacity increasing projects started. The stands on the four sides of the stadium were torn down one at a time, as the Turkish Super League seasons progressed, and the entire renewal and construction project was finalised in 2006.\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 21, 1999. In the episode, after Manjula gives birth to octuplets that were the result of fertility drugs, she and Apu unintentionally allow a zookeeper to exploit their babies in exchange for help after corporate sponsors abandon them for a Shelbyville mom that has given birth to nonuplets. \n\nReception of the episode from television critics has been mixed.\n\nThe family visits Shøp, a store based on Ikea, and decides to go to the food court. There, they meet Apu and Manjula. They say that they would like to have a baby. They eventually do, and Manjula gives birth to octuplets with the help of fertility drugs, given by the Simpsons and Apu. It makes headlines across Springfield, with local companies giving the Nahasapeemapetilons free products. However, their feat is eclipsed when a family in Shelbyville give birth to nine babies. With the discovery, the gifts were revoked. Apu and Manjula swiftly find they are not up to the task of raising eight kids all at once.\n\nApu told Marge that all of his octuplets have colic. Later, Apu is met by the sleazy owner of the Springfield Zoo, a man named Larry Kidkill. Kidkill offers to put Apu's children in a nursery. Although Apu is not open to the idea at first, he caves in and reluctantly accepts. The children are the stars of a show at the zoo named \"Octopia\", but Apu is not impressed and he wants to liberate his children from the zoo's owner, but Kidkill will not let them because they are under contract. Apu talks with Homer, and they sneak into the zoo at night to rescue the octuplets. Unfortunately, Homer accidentally wakes up the nanny, who sounds the alarm.\n\nThey quickly rush the octuplets to the Simpson household only for Kidkill to track them there. Homer manages to negotiate that he perform at the zoo through a new contract with a new act. After Kidkill refuses his original act (which was simply Homer prancing around in a monkey suit), he goes to his second plan; an act where he rides a tricycle with Butch Patrick on his shoulders, both of them dressed as Eddie Munster, on a stage as both are being attacked by cobras (some real, some merely animatronic snakes packed with venom). Inspired by Homer's example, Apu and Manjula resolve that they can take care of their kids, while Homer is mercilessly attacked by several of the snakes and a mongoose put in to contain them.\n\n\"Eight Misbehavin'\" was written by Matt Selman and directed by Steven Dean Moore as part of the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\" (1999–2000). Guest starring in the episode were Jan Hooks (as Manjula), Garry Marshall (as Larry Kidkill), and Butch Patrick (as himself). According to Jonathan Gray in his 2006 book \"Watching with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality\", the episode makes fun of the \"conflation of real time and occasional predilection for time jumps\" often seen in sitcoms. He further noted that in \"Eight Misbehavin\", \"in order to fit a character's pregnancy into one episode, we skip nine months.\" Here, Gray refers the part in the episode where a new scene starts and Homer says: \"Man, the last nine months sure were crazy.\" Bart responds \"I'll say. I learned the true meaning of Columbus Day,\" and then Marge says \"I enjoyed a brief but memorable stint as Sideshow Marge,\" followed by Lisa who says \"I became the most popular girl in school, but blew it by being conceited.\" Bart then concludes by commenting: \"And then I learned the true meaning of winter.\" Gray wrote in his book that \"Here, we are treated to a parody not only of how awkwardly time jumps are proposed, but also of how ultimately irrelevant any sitcom time is — nothing really changes, after all — and finally, of the sort of plots that traditionally fill sitcom time.\"\n\nSeveral references to popular culture are featured in the episode. The episode's plot is loosely based on the life of the Dionne quintuplets. The store Shøp is a parody of the Swedish furniture business IKEA, and the name is a reference to the similar business STØR. The songs played during \"Octopia\" are \"Drop a Beat\" by Moby, \"Welcome to the Jungle\" by Guns N' Roses, \"Ride of the Valkyries\" by Richard Wagner and \"R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.\" by John Mellencamp. Homer's act is set to the song \"Danger Zone\" by Kenny Loggins. In the octuplets room there is a picture of the character Babar the Elephant dressed as former Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\n\"Eight Misbehavin'\" originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 21, 1999. On October 7, 2008, it was released on DVD as part of the box set \"The Simpsons – The Complete Eleventh Season\". Staff members Mike Scully, George Meyer, Matt Selman, Julia Thacker, and Steven Dean Moore participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode, as well as guest voice Garry Marshall. Deleted scenes and concept drawings from the episode were also included on the box set.\n\nThe episode has received mixed reviews from critics. \n\nWhile reviewing the eleventh season of \"The Simpsons\", DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that \"With such a silly concept, [the episode] probably should flop. However, it actually works pretty well. The best moments come from those that feature the kids at the zoo, but a mix of other amusing scenes emerge. Though the show often threatens to falter, it usually succeeds.\" \n\nNancy Basile of About.com, on the other hand, listed the episode as one of the worst episodes of the season—the episodes that \"made me cringe because they included blatant gimmicks and outlandish plots\".\n\nThe episode has become study material for sociology courses at University of California Berkeley, where it is used to \"examine issues of the production and reception of cultural objects, in this case, a satirical cartoon show\", and to figure out what it is \"trying to tell audiences about aspects primarily of American society, and, to a lesser extent, about other societies.\" \n\nHomer's quote \"Kids are the best, Apu. You can teach them to hate the things you hate. And they practically raise themselves, what with the Internet and all\", entered \"The Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations\" in August 2007.\n\n"}

Bayard Jr.\n\nJames Asheton Bayard Jr. (November 15, 1799 – June 13, 1880) was an American lawyer and politician from Delaware. He was a member of the Democratic Party and served as U.S. Senator from Delaware.\n\nBayard was born in Wilmington, Delaware on November 15, 1799. He was a son of Nancy (née Bassett) Bayard and James A. Bayard, a member of the Federalist Party who served as U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator from Delaware. His older siblings included brother Richard H. Bayard, also a U.S. Senator from Delaware, and Ann Caroline Bayard, who operated the Bayard family's ironworks, Victoria Furnace with their brother Henry Milligan Bayard.\n\nHis paternal grandparents were Dr. James Asheton Bayard and Ann (née Hodge) Bayard. The Bayard family was descended from a sister of Director-General Petrus Stuyvesant and came to Bohemia Manor, Cecil County, Maryland in 1698. His maternal grandfather was Richard Bassett, a signatory to the United States Constitution and U.S. Senator from Delaware.\n\nBayard studied the law, and began his legal practice in the city of Wilmington. From 1836 until 1843 he served as United States Attorney for Delaware. In 1851 he was elected to the U.S. Senate. He was re-elected in 1857 and 1863, and served from March 4, 1851, to January 29, 1864, when he resigned. As U.S. Senator he was chairman of the Committee on Engrossed Bills in the 32nd Congress, a member of the Committee on Public Buildings in the 33rd Congress and 34th Congress, a member of the Committee on Judiciary in the 35th Congress and 36th Congress, and a member of the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds in the 35th Congress.\n\nBayard served on the boards of various railroads, including the Wilmington and Susquehanna Railroad, the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad (for which service he is named on the 1839 Newkirk Viaduct Monument), and the Pennsylvania Railroad.\n\nIn 1846, Bayard represented slave owners in a civil suit against Thomas Garrett, a Wilmington iron merchant who was also a \"stationmaster\" on the Underground Railroad. The plaintiffs demanded damages from Garrett for helping around 10 slaves escape to freedom. The suit was tried in the U.S. District Court in New Castle, Delaware, before Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Roger B. Taney (sitting as a circuit judge). (Taney later issued the notorious \"Dred Scott\" decision as Chief Justice.) Bayard won a judgement that all but bankrupted Garrett, who declared on the spot that he would redouble his anti-slavery efforts: \"Friend, I haven't a dollar in the world, but if thee knows a fugitive who needs a breakfast, send him to me.\"\n\nBayard was a conservative and adhered to his interpretation of tradition throughout the American Civil War. He believed the South should be allowed to secede peacefully, and privately hoped for the secession of Delaware and a state convention to address the issue. Citing property rights of owners, he opposed abolitionist measures. He also stated both his opposition to the Civil War and his opposition to any presidential or congressional acts used to suppress the independence of the Southern states.\n\nDuring the Civil War, the Senate required all senators to swear an oath of loyalty to the Union. Bayard refused, stating that such an oath would be unconstitutional, and after taking the oath and giving a long speech disputing its legality, resigned from the Senate.\n\nThe death of his successor, George R. Riddle, on March 29, 1867, left the Senate seat vacant. Bayard interrupted his practice of law in Wilmington and accepted appointment to the vacant seat. He was subsequently elected to fill it, and served again from April 5, 1867, to March 4, 1869. During the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, Bayard voted \"not guilty.\" After declining to run again for re-election, he returned to private practice for several years until poor health incapacitated him.\n\nIn 1872, he was among the nine politicians whose names were submitted by the House of Representatives to the Senate for investigation in the Credit Mobilier scandal. He wrote a letter disavowing any knowledge of the affair, and his name was generally dropped from the investigation.\n\nOn July 8, 1823, Bayard was married to Anne Francis (1802–1864) by the Right Rev. Bishop William White. Anne was the daughter of Thomas Willing Francis and Dorothy (née Willing) Francis and granddaughter of Thomas Willing, the first president of First Bank of the United States. Anne's elder sister, Elizabeth Francis, was the second wife of their cousin, U.S. Senator from Rhode Island, John Brown Francis. Together, they were the parents of:\n\n\nHis wife died on March 11, 1864. Bayard died at Wilmington on June 13, 1880 and is buried there in the Old Swedes Episcopal Church Cemetery. \n\nThrough his son Thomas, he was a grandfather of U.S. Senator Thomas Francis Bayard Jr., who married Elizabeth Bradford du Pont, and was the father of five, including Alexis I. du Pont Bayard, the Lieutenant Governor of Delaware from 1949 to 1953.\n\nSenators were elected by the state legislature at this time – in this case the Delaware General Assembly – to a six-year term beginning March 4. Bayard was elected to a term beginning March 4, 1863, but resigned in 1864. George R. Riddle was appointed to serve the rest of the term, but died in 1867. Bayard was then appointed to serve the remainder of the term.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

It broadcasts for thirty minutes each Monday to Friday from 18:30, covering British national and international news stories and is presented by Mary Nightingale.\n\nOn 22 September 1955 when the ITV television service was launched, ITN provided an early evening news service at 5:50pm. It was known as \"ITN News\", and presented by Gordon Honeycombe. This simple bulletin made use of a single camera, and was intended as a round-up of the day's headlines and looking at stories to be covered in more length by that evening's edition of \"News at Ten\".\n\nOn 6 September 1976, \"ITN News\" moved to 5:45pm and was renamed \"News at 545\". The \"545\" marked a major departure in presentational style from the \"ITN News\" that had preceded it. Initially, the bulletins were broadcast from the \"Police Five\" studio, which enabled the producers to make extensive use of chromakey to display images behind the newscaster, several studio cameras, interviews with correspondents in the studio and on a TV monitor, and wide screen shots of the studio set at the beginning and end of the programme, and when handing over to correspondents.\n\nAlastair Burnet was the original presenter of the \"News at 545\". Michael Nicholson fronted the bulletin on Fridays, and was also a relief presenter. Immediately after the animated visual 'roll' and electronic theme music at the beginning, an announcer intoned in a hushed tone: \"The news at 5:45, with Alastair Burnett/Michael Nicholson\". Other relief presenters in the late 1970s included Leonard Parkin, who at the time also regularly hosted the \"News at One\", and Martyn Lewis. In March 1980, when Burnet departed the \"545\" to present \"News at Ten\", Nicholson replaced him as lead presenter, with Carol Barnes taking over as relief presenter. In September 1986, Nicholson left the \"545\" to return to war reporting, and was replaced by Alastair Stewart.\n\nOn 4 April 1988 the \"News at 545\" underwent some cosmetic changes, with the animated visual 'roll' logo and electronic theme music being dropped in favour of a new computer-generated opening sequence and a more contemporary theme tune; the studio images were still inlaid using chromakey, although these were now also generated by computer. The programme was moved to the main newsroom within the ITN headquarters building, and full-length reports were now featured as part of the programme. ITN dispensed with the \"main\" presenter and relief host format, and instead a \"team\" of newscasters - Alastair Stewart, Fiona Armstrong, Nicholas Owen, Trevor McDonald, Sue Carpenter and Carol Barnes - began presenting the show on a \"rotation\" basis. On 13 February 1989, the introduction of a national weather forecast at the end of the programme led to the bulletin's timeslot starting earlier at 5:40pm, being extended in length and the title being changed to \"News at 540\".\n\nDue to the Gulf Crisis of 1991, ITN were temporarily granted a full half-hour slot each evening; the continued change of time (and length) of the bulletin around this time led to the \"News at 540\" being known simply as the \"ITN News\".\n\nOn 2 March 1992, \"ITN News at 540\" was renamed \"ITN Early Evening News\". The new look made good use of ITN's impressive headquarters in London with opening sequence consisting of a camera panning across the building towards the newsdesk giving a panoramic view of the newsroom. John Suchet became the lead presenter, a role in which he continued until 1999. Barnes and Owen acted as relief presenters.\n\nOn 6 March 1995 all of ITN's news programmes on ITV were relaunched with a more unified look, with exception to \"News at Ten\" which maintained its separate identity. The new look, however, brought elements of \"News at Ten\" to ITN's other bulletins such as the use of the clockface of Big Ben and the \"News at Ten\" theme-tune, however the tune was rearranged differently. The studio at the time made heavy use of the colour blue - ITN's corporate colour at the time. The intro showed different images of Big Ben's clockface with the hands of the clock eventually striking the time at 5:40 - the time at which the programme began. Around this time, Dermot Murnaghan became the main relief presenter.\n\nThe \"ITV Evening News\" was launched on the 8 March 1999. The launch coincided with major changes to the scheduling of news programmes on \nITV. ITN's \"Early Evening News\" programme was moved from 5:40pm to 6:30pm and renamed the \"ITV Evening News\". The programme was extended to become a 30-minute programme, effectively replacing \"News at Ten\" as the channel's flagship news programme which itself was also axed at this time and replaced with a shorter 20 minute bulletin at 11:00pm entitled the \"ITV Nightly News\". Initially, the programme was fronted by Trevor McDonald, with Murnaghan and Kirsty Young the most regular relief presenters.\n\nThe axing of \"News at Ten\" proved unpopular at the time and caused outcry from politicians and the general public, and ratings for ITV's news programmes fell. \"ITV News at Ten\" returned on 22 January 2001, with McDonald once again at the helm; Murnaghan and Young became the lead presenters of the dual-headed \"Evening News\". Mary Nightingale replaced Young a few months later when Young decided not to return following maternity leave. Mark Austin replaced Murnaghan following his defection to BBC News in late 2002.\n\nThe programme relaunched on 2 February 2004 in what was then a state of the art virtual studio set dubbed the \"Theatre of News\" along with the other ITV News programmes. The move saw the ITN newscasters standing (or walking) in front of a news-wall and presenting graphics to viewers. The \"Theatre of News\" was scaled back following a relaunch on 9 February 2009, with a return to a more traditional style of presenters sat behind a desk.\n\nOn 3 August 2009, it was announced that after 16 years co-presenting \"London Tonight\", Alastair Stewart was to leave the regional news programme to become lead co-presenter of the \"ITV Evening News\". Mark Austin would focus on \"ITV News at Ten\", but continue as a relief presenter for the 6.30pm bulletin.\n\nOn 2 November 2009 the programme was retitled as the \"ITV News at 6:30\". The studio set was virtual, using a new green screen electronic compositing system known as 'Ultimatte'. Virtual sets can be created instantly and at low cost. Unlike traditional Chroma key systems, Ultimatte allows for such things as full camera movement and can generate artificial reflections on glass and metallic surfaces.\n\nIt was announced in June 2015 that, as part of a wider restructure at ITV News, Mark Austin would return to the programme full-time, alongside Mary Nightingale from October 2015. Alastair Stewart continues to appear on the programme as a relief presenter, alongside his duties on the \"ITV Lunchtime News\". Coinciding with the main presenter line-up, the programme is once again being referred to as the \"ITV Evening News\".\n\nAfter thirty years with \"ITV News\", it was announced on 26 October 2016 that Austin would leave at the end of the year. It was later confirmed on 13 December 2016 that Nightingale would become the sole presenter of the \"ITV Evening News\" from January 2017 onwards. Austin presented his final bulletin alongside Nightingale on 22 December 2016.\nThe opening title music has been composed by Dave Hewson since 1992. The current title sequence was designed by Lambie Nairn and the music is called \"Global Broadcast\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1887498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887498", "title": "Alfonso Gómez", "text": "Alfonso Gómez\n\nAlfonso Salvador Gómez Becerra (born October 28, 1980), better known as Alfonso Gómez, is a Mexican professional boxer. Gomez is best known for being a competitor on the debut season of reality TV show \"The Contender\", where he finished third out of sixteen fighters and instantly became a fan favorite. Gómez holds notable victories over former world champions Arturo Gatti, Jose Luis Castillo, and Peter Manfredo Jr. He has also fought household names such as Saul Alvarez, Miguel Cotto, and Shawn Porter.\n\nGómez was born in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, but his parents subsequently moved to the city of Oakland, California where his boxing career began as a self-defense class due to constant bullying. He then moved to Napa, CA where he graduated from Napa High School. \nAfter graduating, him and his family moved to Southern California to explore better boxing opportunities and to enter college in Irvine. He has two brothers, Jesus Zeuz and Roberto Robb, who are part of a local hip hop en espanol group called Hy3rid H3. He now lives in Long Beach, CA and has two children, his daughter Heidi Luna Gomez and his son, Leon Harel Gomez.\n\nComing off a strong amateur career where he represented Mexico in the quarterfinals of the 2000 Olympic Qualifying Tournament for the Americas, Alfonso Gomez turned pro in 2001, and was used by his first few managers as a stepping stone fighter for hotter-looking prospects. Alfonso knew the disadvantages in each fight as a \"stepping stone\" so he trained extra hard to prove himself. After winning a few fights against undefeated protected fighters in which he was supposed to lose, the media nicknamed him, \"The Executioner of the Undefeated,\" and the real life story of the \"True Underdog\" began.\n\nIn 2004, Alfonso got on the boxing reality TV show The Contender as an alternate for a chance to win one million dollars, though he had to fight above his natural weight(Welterweight) at Middleweight due to the show's weight class choice. On the show, he was placed on the West Coast team (as was Ishe Smith) and he challenged the highly ranked Peter Manfredo in the first fight in a surprising move after Joey Gilbert seemed reluctant to take the first fight of the show against the undersized Jeff Fraza. With the exception of Ishe and Alfonso himself, both teams were skeptical as to Alfonso's chances, but Alfonso beat the then-undefeated Rhode Islander in a shocking fight where he outhustled, outboxed, and outfought Manfredo over five rounds, sending him home, though Peter was brought back later on the show due to Jeff Fraza contracting a case of chicken pox.\n\nIn the quarterfinals, he beat the confident Ahmed Kaddour (who had been brought back in to replace Juan de la Rosa and as a thinly-veiled attempt by Manfredo, Brinkley, Gilbert, and Bonsante to psych out Ishe Smith) by unanimous decision in a tough matchup that Manfredo was allowed to make as the challenge winner of the week at the time. Gomez outworked Kaddour the first 3 rounds, coming in off his jab and straight right, followed by hard body shots, throwing twice as many punches as Kaddour the first two rounds, absorbing punishment throughout the fight but consistently pushing the pace. Kaddour fought in hard flurries, landing the harder shots throughout the fight, especially the right hand lead and left hook knocking Gomez back a step or two occasionally stunning him, but then Kaddour would back off and move until ready to stage his next assault. Gomez suffered some pretty bad swelling, especially after walking into full force straight rights and left hooks in the final 2 rounds when their workrate was closer, but Gomez won 48-47 on Marty Denkin's scorecard and 49-46 on Chuck Hassett and Ray Corona's cards.\n\nThe Semi-Final round saw Gomez up against Manfredo again. Gómez was still bruised up from his previous fight against Ahmed Kaddour and Manfredo won their rematch by UD in a tough seven round fight. Like their first fight, Gomez seemed to have the advantage after five rounds, but Manfredo seemed fresher in the last two rounds to win the fight, though both landed plenty of punches on each other. Gomez, whose jaw was incredibly swollen after taking lots of punishment from Kaddour and Manfredo back-to-back, visited Manfredo in the locker room to wish him well moving on.\n\nOn the finale show, Gomez defeated fellow semi-final loser Jesse Brinkley, the consensus favorite in their match and hardest single-shot puncher of Season 1, by unanimous decision on May 24, 2005 in the \"Bronze match\" of the Contender show. Brinkley won the first round of their fight behind a series of stiff jabs and hard right hands, but Gomez won the next two rounds close behind good counter-punching and short combinations. The fourth round had a few swings, as Brinkley came back and dominated the first half of the round landing some huge punches, but Gomez was able to weather the storm and hurt Brinkley to the body badly in the second half of the round and beat him up during the second half to take the round. In the final round, Gomez continued to beat up Jesse until the last ten seconds, when Gomez celebrated his probable win a little prematurely and Brinkley got him with a big right hand at the bell, though Gomez was able to take the punch without being seriously hurt. He may take some consolation from having beaten Brinkley in the 3rd Place Fight, which guaranteed him a nice packet of prize money(200k and a 2005 Toyota Tundra)—and the whole Contender experience catapulted him to a world ranking of 21 out of 861. Even though he did not come out as the overall winner of the show, Gomez probably garnered the largest fan following of the fighters from Season 1.\n\nGoing back to his original weight class range of Welterweight/Light Middleweight, Gomez fought Luciano Perez in a five-round contest on October 15, 2005 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on the Contender Rematch card, and won by fourth round TKO. Perez was game, but sorely outclassed in terms of boxing skill and Alfonso landed a high amount of punches on Perez throughout the match until the referee stopped the fight late in Round Four.\n\nGómez fought Jesse Feliciano for a third time to a draw after a long layoff on May 5, 2006 at the Aladdin Resort in Las Vegas, Nevada on the Latin Fury card with the Contender Season 1 champion Sergio Mora. The fight was a candidate for Fight of the Year. For most of the first four rounds, Gomez outboxed the rugged Feliciano, but coming off a long layoff and having to move a lot with Feliciano's relentless pressure, Gomez lost his leg stamina at the end of the 4th round and had to bang with Feliciano. Both guys landed tons of leather on each other in the following rounds, but Jesse seemingly got the better of the next two rounds. In the 7th and 8th rounds, Gómez seemed to get a second wind as he got some of his legs back and seemed to edge the last two rounds, but Feliciano still landed on him a good amount and came forward throughout, making those two rounds debatable. Gómez won 77-75 on one judge's card, but the fight was scored 76-76 on the other two cards, rendering the rubber match between the two a draw.\n\nOn August 25, 2006, Gómez fought Carson \"Kid\" Jones in an eight-round bout at the Arco Arena in Sacramento, CA. He pressured a game Jones throughout and beat him up pretty badly over the eight rounds until the referee stopped the fight in Round Eight. While Jones was clearly losing, it was a quick stoppage as Jones was still able to defend himself to some extent at the time.\n\nGómez was a part of the American team on , where he was pitted against the hard-punching Martin Concepcion on March 30, 2007. Alfonso won due to TKO from an uppercut followed by a left hook late in the 7th round after having largely dominated the fight prior to that.\n\nArturo Gatti needed a decent comeback opponent to determine whether he still had anything in the tank after a tough stoppage loss to Carlos Baldomir a year earlier. HBO gave the Gatti team a list of acceptable opponents and the Gatti team picked Gómez for Gatti to come back against, as Gómez was regarded by the Gatti team as a crude brawler type, a light puncher, and slow. The fight was also meant to be a setup fight for Gatti vs Julio César Chávez Jr.. Instead, Gómez defeated the favored Arturo Gatti on July 14, 2007 via 7th-round TKO in a dominant effort, landing right hands repeatedly over Gatti's jab and generally getting off first with his own jab and short combinations to Gatti's head and body. Gatti retired following this match.\n\nThree months later Gomez outpointed Ben Tackie in a unanimous decision in Carson, California on October 16, 2007, where Gómez also broke his right hand in the 2nd round hitting the iron-chinned Tackie with an uppercut. Gómez threw an incredibly high volume of punches in the early rounds despite his injury, outboxing Tackie, but Tackie kept the pressure on throughout and made the last few rounds of the fight hard for Gómez. However, Gómez fought through the pain of his hand and got the clear decision win. The Tackie win was supposed to set up a future match against Julio César Chávez Jr., but the Chávez Jr. team did not want to make the match. Instead, Alfonso got a shot against then WBA Welterweight champion Miguel Cotto, who needed a stay-busy opponent to hype up a possible Antonio Margarito-Cotto match, with Margarito fighting Kermit Cintrón on the same card.\n\nGómez faced and lost against Miguel Cotto via 5th-round TKO on April 12, 2008 after the ring-side doctor declared him unable to continue after receiving constant punishment from Cotto over the five rounds. Alfonso came into the fight with a still injured right hand (broken in the Tackie fight) and after a training camp which he was badly ill at one point so he was not in his best condition in the ring, and Cotto dominated him, landing nearly forty punches a round against him before the ringside doctor stopped the fight prior to the 6th round, though Gomez wanted to continue the fight.\n\nOn May 1, 2009 after a long layoff Alfonso Gómez (19-4-2, 9 KOs) stopped Juan Buendia (14-3-1, 8 KOs) in a high action fight with a left hook to the liver in the 8th round, at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas. He expressed a desire to fight Julio César Chávez Jr., but Jr. was now hovering around Middleweight so this fight was unlikely to happen.\n\nOn August 29, 2009, Gómez scored a first round stoppage of Raul Munoz in Hawaii on a card with Brian Viloria. He hurt Munoz with the first right hand he threw, then poured it on until dropping Munoz with another big right hand-left hook to body-right hand to face combination. Munoz got up in time, but was still damaged from the left hook to the body, and Gomez hit him with a few more punches, including another left hook to the body, and Munoz took a knee and indicated no ability to continue so the referee stopped the fight. This win by Alfonso set up a fight with Jesús Soto-Karass, a solid Top Rank prospect with a long winning streak and a high action style.\n\nOn November 14, 2009, Gómez fought against the favored Jesús Soto-Karass on the Manny Pacquiao vs. Miguel Cotto undercard \"Firepower\" at the MGM Grand. In a reasonably competitive action fight, Gómez outboxed Soto-Karass for the first four rounds of the affair, during which Soto-Karass committed a large multitude of low blow fouls upon Gómez that ultimately cost him two points, and headbutted Gómez badly by accident in the 3rd round, opening a large cut around Gomez's right eye. The cut bled profusely throughout until it necessitated a doctor stoppage in the sixth round of the fight, sending the fight to a Technical decision, which Gómez won 58-54, 57-55(x2). Gómez also attained the vacant WBC Continental Americas Welterweight title as a result of this victory.\n\nGómez fought José Luis Castillo on the Manny Pacquiao vs. Joshua Clottey undercard on March 13, 2010, at the Cowboys Stadium in Texas. It was pretty much a fight to determine whether Castillo had anything left or not as Castillo came into the fight off a small win streak, but against mostly mediocre competition, with the last solid opponent he faced having beaten him pretty easily in Sebastian Lujan. Gómez outboxed and beat up Castillo for five rounds before Castillo retired in the corner prior to the 6th round. Castillo did not have anything in this fight and announced his retirement immediately after the fight, though he changed his mind a few weeks later. Gómez thanked him for the opportunity in the post-fight press conference and mentioned some of the memories he had of Castillo.\n\nGómez has always expressed a desire to become a World Champion. He is coached by his father, Alfonso Gómez, Sr and has been managed for some years now by Gary Gittelsohn, who also manages Brian Viloria. Alfonso is now being promoted by Top Rank\n\nOn December 4, 2010, Gómez was signed to get the fight he's expressed a desire for many times before, a matchup with the undefeated Julio César Chávez Jr. at Middleweight (the contracted weight was 157) for Chávez Jr.'s WBC Silver Middleweight belt on the In Harm's Way card as the main event. However, during training for the bout Alfonso tore some ligaments in his left elbow and had to withdraw from the card, and will undergo a few months of rehab. For his part, Chávez Jr. was set to fight Powel Wolak as a replacement bout, but after adjusting the weight limit for said match to 165 lbs, Chávez Jr. himself had to pull out due to the flu messing up his training and weight loss.\n\nGómez fought and beat Calvin Green via 2nd Round TKO on May 21 at the Morongo Casino in California on a Fox Deportes card for his comeback fight off the injury to his left elbow. Green caught him a few times with hooks in the first round, but Alfonso mostly dominated that round with good counter-punching and combinations to Green's head and body. It was more of the same in Round 2 when Gómez slipped a Green jab midway through the round and countered with a big straight right that got Green in trouble. Gómez went after and cornered Green, threw some more combinations and got another big right hand counter in that forced a stoppage by the referee.\n\nOn September 17, 2011, Alfonso Gómez got another shot at a World Title when he took on Canelo Álvarez for his WBC Light Middleweight title at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The card was part of the \"Star Power\" undercard featuring Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs Victor Ortiz and shown as part of a split-site venture.\n\nGómez and Álvarez got off to a tentative start in Round 1, with Álvarez playing counterpuncher and Gómez playing pressure fighter. The round was close until the very end of it, where Álvarez caught Gómez with a kind of half hook, half jab while Gómez came in on him somewhat off-balance. The punch scored a flash knockdown on Gómez, swinging the round in Álvarez's favor. In Round 2, Gómez picked up the pace and his strategy for fighting Álvarez was apparent, he would come in very low using upper body movement on Álvarez to avoid counters, fire off his jab and throw short combinations to Álvarez's head and body. This strategy proved to be effective as Álvarez was not able to time Gómez and had his offense blunted by Gómez's workrate. Álvarez would slip in a hard shot here and there, but Gómez was outlanding/outworking him by a wide margin and constantly bringing the fight to Álvarez. This pattern continued in Rounds 3 and 4. In the first half of Round 5, Gómez had a good start to the round but Alvarez finished up the round strong letting his hands go a bit more to make the round debatable. In Round 6, both men had their moments, but near the end of the round, Álvarez caught Gómez with a counter right uppercut that stunned Gómez. Gómez went back to the ropes, put his guard up, Álvarez came after him with a flurry of six or seven punches, the majority of which were partially blocked by Gómez, but the relatively unknown referee for the fight Wayne Hedgpeth called the fight in Álvarez's favor after the flurry. By the accounts of the HBO commentary team and general consensus, the stoppage of the fight was very fast as Gómez seemed to be able to defend himself and wasn't that hurt, making the stoppage look fishy. Also, despite seemingly controlling, setting the pace of the fight, and outlanding/outworking Álvarez by a wide margin for the majority of the fight, Gomez as it turned out was losing 49-45 (x2) and 50-44 on the official scorecards prior to the stoppage, while unofficially HBO had the fight a draw. Gómez said after the fight that Alvarez hit pretty hard and was a good counterpuncher, but he felt that the referee was looking for a reason to stop the fight in Álvarez's favor and so he stopped the fight too early. He said he knew something like that could happen with Álvarez's backing and it is what it is. He also stated his plan to go back down to the Welterweight division and try to win a championship there.\n\nOn May 5 as part of the undercard for Floyd Mayweather vs. Miguel Cotto also dubbed \"Ring Kings\", Alfonso Gómez was to be fighting hot Mayweather Promotions prospect Jessie Vargas in a ten-round Welterweight fight. However, Gómez injured his back in training a couple of weeks prior to the fight and was forced to withdraw from the card, with a fellow former Contender Steve Forbes stepping in as his replacement to fight Vargas. He has stated that he hopes to get the fight with Vargas at a later date.\n\nOn July 28, 2012, Alfonso Gómez faced off with undefeated Welterweight prospect Shawn Porter as the opener for the Guerrero vs Aydin card in San Jose. Porter is best known for being Manny Pacquiao's chief sparring partner to help prepare him against Miguel Cotto back in 2009.\n\nGómez vs Porter was a great action fight that was possibly a Fight of the Year candidate for 2012. The athletic Porter did well using his handspeed in particular to land combinations on Gómez, being busier and landing more punches throughout the fight, but Gomez returned fire with the cleaner, harder shots throughout, landing some very clean straight rights and left hooks to Porter's body and head, which made most of the rounds tough to call. The fight was a rough one, with both fighters landing a lot of punches and clashing heads multiple times. By the end, Porter had two cuts over his eyes, one being really nasty near the end, and Gómez had pretty bad swelling in terms of the damage they dealt to each other. Shawn Porter won by UD, 96-94, 97-93, and 98-92.\n\nAfter a near two-year layoff due to injuries and somewhat unlucky circumstances regarding a prospective Victor Ortiz fight, Gomez returned to the ring to face Ed \"The Lion\" Paredes in a ten-round junior middleweight fight on July 9, 2014 in Las Vegas as the main event of a Fox Sports 1 card. It was a solid action fight and competitive, but Gómez was able to outbox and outfight Paredes over the ten rounds despite suffering two questionable knockdown calls against him by referee Kenny Bayless in Round 4 and Round 6. He won by a wide decision on the cards.\n\nOn March 20, 2015, Alfonso Gómez fought Yoshihiro Kamegai as part of a Fox Sports 1 card at the Fantasy Spring Casino in Indio, California. Kamegai is best known for his action, pressure style and giving Robert Guerrero all he could handle in a slugfest in 2014. The fight was an action packed battle, as predicted by Gomez. Although he had made statements before the fight that he had a new and better adjusted style for himself and not a \"typical mexican\" style of fighting, Gómez and Kamegai fought toe to toe virtually the entire match. Gómez began leading on points early on, making an effective usage of his jab versus a determined Kamegai who kept absorbing punches and going forward, seeking Gómez' liver. An accidental headbutt mid-fight cost Gómez a point deduction. Gómez' demonstrated superior ring generalship, keeping close to his opponent, and despite Kamegai keeping the pressure on at all times, Gómez was able to administer some spectacular counter punches that saw Kamegai's head literally twisting in the opposite direction. Both boxers appeared more and more tired as the fight went on. At the end of the bout, the unanimous decision by a wide margin was awarded to Gomez, his second win after his recent comeback.\n\nGómez was scheduled to face Pablo César Cano in a ten round bout at light middleweight on July 15, 2016 at the Fantasy Springs Resort Casino in Indio, California, U.S. but was cancelled when Gómez suffered an injury during camp.\n\n"}

It is a Moorland colony consisting mostly of pasture land and is predominantly an agricultural area.\n\nAfter the reclamation edict of the king Frederick II of Prussia in East Frisia many new settlements were created to secure a place for the increasing population area.\n\nIn 1780, after two years of debate for rights to the land, the measurement for the first piece of land, 3 Diemat (about 1.5 hectares) was awarded to Rencke Janssen. Following him were other settlers Claas Janssen, Otto Christoffers, January Focken and Harm Habben. Vossbarg initially belonged Strackholt, a town to the west, but few years later, in 1787, Vossbarg emerged as an independent municipality.\n\nThe first Moorland lived as farmers of the cultivation of wheat. Starting from 1824 some craftsmen, carpenters, restaurant operators/barkeepers, cutters, bakers, and shoemakers began to settle in Vossbarg. Peat was harvested for personal fuel needs, however, there was no canal present and transportation of large quantities of peat became nearly impossible. After some years the moorland soil became depleted. The town, which had a promising beginning, began to experience poverty. The heads of families hired themselves out as day laborers to the moor companies in the neighboring towns of Spetzerfehn and Großefehn. Others sought work as harvest hands in the marsh areas or in the Netherlands. During time, Vossbarg citizens were persuaded to emigrate to America in response to the other citizens who had emigrated there. Between 1850 and 1900 numerous residents of Vossbarg emigrated because of the economic and political difficulties.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the situation in Vossbarg had improved. Artificial fertilizers were in use and the crop yields had increased. A particular blessing for Vossbarg was the founding of the power-station at Wiesmoor. Many men and women were employed there for the production of peat.\n\nIn 1972, Vossbarg came under the jurisdiction of Wiesmoor as a result of the district reforms instituted by the state of Lower Saxony.\n\nThrough the efforts of the villagers, the 200th anniversary of the founding of Vossbarg was celebrated in 1987. Heinz Saathoff, the Vossbarg village manager, published an anniversary booklet for the occasion. Richard Ahlrichs, a teacher and native of Vossbarg, wrote the text. Numerous old photos and documents were produced by the residents and printed in the booklet or displayed in the school building of Vossbarg. The entire community was spruced up festively for the occasion. In 1972, Vossbarg came under the jurisdiction of Wiesmoor as a result of the district reforms instituted by the state of Lower Saxony.\n\n"}

Carpenter Canyon Road is a minimally maintained dirt road reaching roughly 10 miles into the mountains and Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. A clearwater stream, the Carpenter Canyon Creek, runs through Carpenter Canyon the entire year, supporting a small population of trout, which is uncommon in the Spring Mountains and Mojave Desert.\n\nThe Spring Mountains divide the Pahrump Valley, Mesquite Valley, and upper Amargosa River basin to the west from the Las Vegas Valley, to the east and which drains into the Colorado River, thus the mountains define part of the boundary of the Great Basin and Mojave Desert ecoregions. A number of springs can be found in the recesses of the Red Rock Canyon area which lies on the mid-eastern side of the range. One of the more notable springs feeds Carpenter Canyon Creek.\n\nIn Lower Carpenter Canyon, Creosote bush - \"Larrea tridentata\" and golden native bunchgrasses dominate the landscape. Moving further up in elevation, Banana yucca - \"Yucca baccata\", Mojave yucca - \"Yucca schidigera\", and the Joshua Tree - \"Yucca brevifolia\" appear more frequently. Small flowering plants also become common. At around 5,000 feet, Utah Juniper -\"Juniperus osteosperma\" trees and Single-leaf Pinyon - \"Pinus monophylla\" are introduced, and above this elevation they dominate the terrain. Towards the source of the creek, and the head of the canyon Ponderosa Pine - \"Pinus ponderosa\" and a wide variety of flowering plants are prevalent.

It is a subprefecture of Côtes-d'Armor, the capital of Trégor and the center of an urban area of almost 60,000 inhabitants.\n\nInhabitants of Lannion are called \"lannionnais\" in French.\n\nLannion takes its name from \"Lann Huon\" in Breton or \"Land of Huon\" in English. \n\nThe old quarter of Lannion attracts many tourists to the city. The old quarter contains old squares, a church called Brélévenez, half-timbered houses, chapels and frescoes.\n\nOn 23 October 2006, the municipality launched a plan to promote the Breton language through the Ya d'ar brezhoneg (\"Yes to Breton\") charter.\n\nIn 2008, 11.96% of the children attended bilingual schools in primary education.\n\nLannion is a large telecommunications research center in France with several firms such as Nokia, Orange and SAGEMCOM operating there.

{"id": "1887527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887527", "title": "Resolution Trust Corporation", "text": "Resolution Trust Corporation\n\nThe Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) was a U.S. government-owned asset management company run by Lewis William Seidman and charged with liquidating assets, primarily real estate-related assets such as mortgage loans, that had been assets of savings and loan associations (S&Ls) declared insolvent by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) as a consequence of the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. It also took over the insurance functions of the former Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB).\n\nBetween 1989 and mid-1995, the Resolution Trust Corporation closed or otherwise resolved 747 thrifts with total assets of $394 billion. Its funding was provided by the Resolution Funding Corporation (REFCORP) which still exists to support the debt obligations it created for these functions.\n\nThe Resolution Trust Corporation was established in 1989 by the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA), and it was overhauled in 1991. In addition to privatizing, and maximizing the recovery from the disposition of, the assets of failed S&Ls, FIRREA also included three specific goals designed to channel the resources of the RTC toward particular societal groups. The goals included maximizing opportunities for minority- and women-owned contractors, maximizing availability of affordable single- and multi-family housing, and protecting local real estate and financial markets from asset dumping. Of the three goals, only the protection of local markets and concerns over dumping was given a great deal of attention. The agency was slow to implement Minority and Women-owned Business (MWOB) and Affordable Housing programs.\n\nThe Resolution Trust Corporation was a 501(c)(1) organization.\n\nIn 1995, the Resolution Trust Corporation's duties were transferred to the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). In 2006, the SAIF and its sister fund for banks—the bank insurance fund (BIF)—also administered by the FDIC, were combined to form the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) under the provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005.\n\nAfter initially emphasizing individual and bulk asset sales, the Resolution Trust Corporation pioneered the use of equity partnerships to help liquidate real estate and financial assets inherited from insolvent thrift institutions. While a number of different structures were used, all of the equity partnerships involved a private sector partner acquiring a partial interest in a pool of assets, controlling the management and sale of the assets in the pool, and making distributions to the RTC based on the RTC's retained interest.\n\nThe equity partnerships allowed the RTC to participate in any gains from the portfolios. Prior to introducing the equity partnership program, the RTC had engaged in outright individual and bulk sales of its asset portfolios. The pricing on certain types of assets often proved to be disappointing because the purchasers discounted heavily for unknowns regarding the assets, and to reflect uncertainty at the time regarding the real estate market. By retaining an interest in asset portfolios, the RTC was able to participate in the extremely strong returns being realized by portfolio investors. Additionally, the equity partnerships enabled the RTC to benefit by the management and liquidation efforts of their private sector partners, and the structure helped assure an alignment of incentives superior to that which typically exists in a principal/contractor relationship.\n\nThe following is a summary description of RTC Equity Partnership Programs:\n\nUnder the Multiple Investor Funds (MIF) program, the RTC established limited partnerships (each known as a Multiple Investor Fund) and selected private sector entities to be the general partner of each MIF.\n\nThe RTC conveyed to the MIF a portfolio of assets (principally commercial non- and sub-performing mortgage loans) which were described generically, but which had not been identified at the time the MIF general partners were selected. The assets were delivered in separate pools over time, and there were separate closings for each pool.\n\nThe selected general partner paid the RTC for its partnership interest in the assets. The price was determined by the Derived Investment Value (DIV) of the assets (an estimate of the liquidation value of assets based on a valuation formula developed by the RTC), multiplied by a percentage of DIV based on the bid of the selected general partner. The general partner paid its equity share relating to each pool at the closing on the pool. The RTC retained a limited partnership interest in the MIF.\n\nThe MIF asset portfolio was leveraged by RTC-provided seller financing. The RTC offered up to 75% seller financing, and one element of the bid was the amount of seller financing required by the bidder. Because of the leverage, the amount required to be paid by the MIF general partner on account of its interest was less than it would have been if the MIF had been an all-equity transaction.\n\nThe MIF general partner, on behalf of the MIF, engaged an asset manager (one or more entities of the MIF general partner team) to manage and liquidate the asset pool. The asset manager was paid a servicing fee out of MIF funds, and used MIF funds to improve, manage and market the assets. The asset manager was responsible for day-to-day management of the MIF, but the general partner controlled major budgetary and liquidation decisions. The RTC had no management role.\n\nAfter repayment of the RTC seller financing debt, net cash flow was divided between the RTC (as limited partner) and general partner in accordance with their respective percentage interests (the general partner had at least a 50% interest).\n\nEach of the MIF general partners was a joint venture among an asset manager with experience in managing and liquidating distressed real estate assets, and a capital source. There were two MIF transactions involving more than 1,000 loans having an aggregate book value of slightly over $2 billion and an aggregate DIV of $982 million.\n\nThe N-series and S-series mortgage trust programs were successor programs to the MIF program. The N-series and S-series structure was different from that of the MIF in that the subject assets were pre-identified by the RTC (under the MIF, the specific assets had not been identified in advance of the bidding) and the interests in the asset portfolios were competitively bid on by pre-qualified investors with the highest bid winning (the RTC's process for selecting MIF general partners, in contrast, took into account non-price factors).\n\nThe \"N\" of the N series stood for \"nonperforming\". For the N series, the RTC would convey to a Delaware business trust a pre-identified portfolio of assets, mostly commercial non- and sub-performing mortgage loans. Pre-qualified investor teams competitively bid for a 49% interest in the trust, and the equity for this interest was payable to the RTC by the winning bidder when it closed on the acquisition of its interest.\n\nThe trust, at its creation, issued a class A certificate to the private sector investor evidencing its ownership interest in the Trust, and a class B certificate to the RTC evidencing its ownership interest. The class A certificate holder exercised those management powers typically associated with a general partner (that is, it controlled the operation of the trust), and the RTC, as the class B certificate holder, had a passive interest typical of a limited partner.\n\nThe class A certificate holder, on behalf of the trust, engaged an asset manager to manage and liquidate the asset pool. The asset manager was paid a servicing fee out of trust funds. Typically, the asset manager was a joint venture partner in the class A certificate holder. The asset manager used trust funds to improve, maintain and liquidate trust assets, and had day-to-day management control. The class A certificate holder exercised control over major budgetary and disposition decisions.\n\nThe trust, through a pre-determined placement agent designated by the RTC, leveraged its asset portfolio by issuing commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBSs), the proceeds of which went to the RTC. Because of the leverage, the amount required to be paid by the class A certificate holder on account of its interest was less than it would have been if the N-Trust had been an all-equity transaction.\n\nNet cash flow was first used to repay the CMBS debt, after which it was divided between the RTC and class A certificate holder at their respective equity percentages (51% RTC, 49% class A).\n\nThere were a total of six N-series partnership transactions in which the RTC placed 2,600 loans with an approximate book value of $2.8 billion and a DIV of $1.3 billion. A total of $975 million of CMBS bonds were issued for the six N-series transaction, representing 60% of the value of N-series trust assets as determined by the competitive bid process (the value of the assets implied by the investor bids was substantially greater than the DIV values calculated by the RTC). While the original bond maturity was 10 years from the transaction, the average bond was retired in 21 months from the transaction date, and all bonds were retired within 28 months.\n\nThe S-series program was similar to the N-series program, and contained the same profile of assets as the N-series transactions. The S series was designed to appeal to investors who might lack the resources necessary to undertake an N-series transaction, and differed from the N-series program in the following respects.\n\nThe S-series portfolios were smaller. The \"S\" of S series stands for \"small\"; the average S-series portfolio had a book value of $113 million and a DIV of $52 million, whereas the N-series average portfolio had a book value of $464 million and a DIV of $220 million. As a consequence, it required an equity investment of $4 to $9 million for investor to undertake an S-series transaction, versus $30 to $70 million for an N-series transaction.\n\nThe S-series portfolio was not leveraged through the issuance of CMBS, although it was leveraged through a 60% RTC purchase money financing. In the N-series program where CMBS were issued, the asset managers had to be qualified by debt rating agencies (e.g., Standard & Poor's) as a condition to the agencies' giving a rating to the CMBS. This was not necessary in the S-series program\n\nAssets in the S-series portfolios were grouped geographically, so as to reduce the investors' due diligence costs.\n\nThere were nine S-series transactions, into which the RTC contributed more than 1,100 loans having a total book value of approximately $1 billion and a DIV of $466 million. The RTC purchase money loans, aggregating $284 million for the nine S-transactions, were all paid off within 22 months of the respective transaction closing dates (on average, the purchase money loans were retired in 16 months).\n\nThe RTC Land Fund program was created to enable the RTC to share in the profit from longer term recovery and development of land. Under the Land Fund program, the RTC selected private sector entities to be the general partners of 30-year term limited partnerships known as Land Funds. The Land Fund program was different from the MIF and N/S-Series programs in that the Land Fund general partner had the authority to engage in long-term development, whereas the MIFs and N/S-Series Trusts were focused on asset liquidation.\n\nThe RTC conveyed to the Land Fund certain pre-identified land parcels, and non/sub-performing mortgage loans secured by land parcels. The selected general partner paid the RTC for its general partnership interest in the Land Fund. The winning bid for each Land Fund pool would determine the implied value of the pool, and the winning bidder, at closing, would pay to the RTC 25% of the implied value. The land fund investors were given the option of contributing 25%, 30%, 35%, or 40% of the equity for commensurate interest, but all chose to contribute 25% of the equity.\n\nThe Land Fund general partner could, at its discretion, transfer assets in Land Fund pools to special-purpose entities, and those entities could then borrow money collateralized by the asset to fund development. Furthermore, a third-party developer or financing source could acquire an equity interest in the special purpose entity in exchange for services or funding. The general partner was authorized to develop the land parcels on a long term basis, and had comprehensive authority concerning the operation of the Land Fund. Costs to improve, manage and liquidate the assets were borne by the Land Fund.\n\nNet cash flow from the Land Fund was distributable in proportion to the respective contributions of the general partner (25%) and RTC (75%). If and when the Land Fund partnership distributed to the RTC an amount equal to the RTC's capital investment (i.e., 75% of the implied value of the Land Fund pool), from and after such point, net cash flow would be divided on a 50/50 basis.\n\nLand Fund general partners were joint ventures between asset managers, developers and capital sources. There were three land fund programs, giving rise to 12 land fund partnerships for different land asset portfolios. These funds received 815 assets with a total book value of $2 billion and DIV of $614 million.\n\nUnder the judgments, deficiencies, and chargeoffs Program (JDC), the RTC established limited partnerships and selected private sector entities to be the general partner of each JDC Partnership. The JDC program was different from the MIF, N/S Series and Land Fund programs in that the general partner paid only a nominal price for the assets and was selected on a beauty-contest basis, and the general partner (rather than the partnership itself) had to absorb most operating costs.\n\nThe RTC would convey to the limited partnership certain judgments, deficiency actions, and charged-off indebtedness (JDCs) and other claims which typically were unsecured and considered of questionable value. The assets were not identified in advance, and were transferred to the JDC partnership in a series of conveyances over time.\n\nThe general partner was selected purely on the basis of perceived competence. It made payments to the RTC in the amount of one basis point (0.01%) of the book value of the assets conveyed. The general partner exercised comprehensive control in managing and resolving the assets. Proceeds typically were split 50/50 with the RTC. Operating costs (except under special circumstances) were absorbed by the general partner, not the JDC partnership.\n\nJDC general partners consisted of asset managers and collection firms. The JDC program was adopted by the FDIC and is still in existence.\n\n\n"}

It is an elective procedure that is done to relieve pain and restore function to the joint after damage by arthritis or some other type of trauma.\n\nFor the last 45 years the most successful and common form of arthroplasty is the surgical replacement of arthritic or destructive or necrotic joint or joint surface with a prosthesis. For example a hip joint that is affected by osteoarthritis may be replaced entirely (total hip arthroplasty) with a prosthetic hip. This would involve replacing both the acetabulum (hip socket) and the head and neck of the femur. The purpose of this procedure is to relieve pain, to restore range of motion and to improve walking ability, thus leading to the improvement of muscle strength.\n\n\nArthroplasty presents various and continuous challenges to the engineer and surgeon. The prosthesis selected must be nontoxic yet resistant, compatible and durable. Meeting all these criteria usually means that the prosthesis will not last 10–20 years. 75% of artificial knees will last 20 years and 90% will last 10 years.\n\nIn recent years the technology has been improved with a porous-coated prosthesis which allows for stronger bonding to the body, but even more notable improvements have derived from the recent explosion in computer-assisted design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM). Using X-rays and other scans of the patient as well as modern 3D printing, personally tailored prostheses are a reality for more and more individuals.\n\n\n"}

The museum was originally founded in 1932 by the Republican Government of Catalonia. The modern institution was created under the Museums of Catalonia Act in 1990 by the Ministry of Culture of the same Government.\n\nThe head office is located in the former Palace of Graphic Arts, which was built on the Montjuïc hill for the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition. The pavilion was initially to be dismantled once the event was over, but it was conserved and refitted by the architect Josep Gudiol before the museum opened its doors in 1932.\n\nThe museum is composed by a group of five museum venues archaeological sites in several places of Catalonia:\n\nOfficially, Museu d'Arqueologia de Barcelona i Institut de Prehistòria i Arqueologia. The museum was designed by Pelagi Martínez i Patricio, covers an area of 4,000 m and is structured into five chronological spaces: prehistory; protohistory, the Greek and Phoenician colonisations; the Roman Empire; and, finally, the Visigoths, marking the start of the medieval period. Some of the main attractions are the Greek statue of Asclepius from the 3rd century BCE which was discovered in Empúries, the Iberian Treasure of Tivissa and the votive crown from the Treasure of Torredonjimeno.\n\nThe village of Sant Martí d'Empúries is on a small isthmus that has been settled since the 9th century BCE, when it was inhabited by Indigetes. The town itself was built around the 6th century BCE by Greek colonists and was later occupied by the Romans during the Punic Wars. Archaeological recovery of the site began in 1908 and 25% of the site has been excavated. In addition to the outdoor exhibits, many of the artifacts discovered here can be seen in the museum on the site.\n\nFounded in 1846 as the \"Provincial Museum of Antiquities and Fine Arts\", making it one of the oldest museums in Catalonia. It was relocated on several occasions until it arrived at its current location in the Benedictine monastery of Sant Pere de Galligants in 1857. It became a part of MAC in 1992.\n\nTh settlement at Olèrdola was continuously inhabited from the 8th century BCE to the time of the Reconquista. The site includes an Iron Age fortified nucleus, an Iberian settlement, a Roman fortification and a medieval town with Romanesque and pre-Romanesque churches and medieval tombs cut into the rock. It was opened to the public in November 1971 and became part of the Archaeology Museum of Catalonia in 1995.\n\nLocated in the Baix Empordà, the Iberian town of Ullastret is the largest Iberian settlement discovered so far in Catalonia, with a history stretching back to the 5th Century B.C. Excavations started in 1948 and continue to this day. Visitors can walk around the ruined walls and cobbled streets of the village, as well as visit the Ullastret Monographic Museum, which is also part of the complex.\n\nOfficially, \"Centre d'Arqueologia Subaquàtica de Catalunya\" (CASC) in Girona. Created in 1992 to protect underwater archeological sites and part of MAC since 1996, the centre's mission is to take inventory, protect, conserve, and study underwater heritage sites in Catalonia. In addition to its own projects, CASC provides support for external archeological teams.\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the Craon family, son of Renaud le Bourguignon and Ennoguen de Vitré.\n\nRobert was born around the turn of the 12th century, the youngest of the three sons of Renaud de Craon. He settled in Aquitaine and was engaged to the daughter of the lord of Angoumois, but gave up his wedding and travelled to Palestine after learning of the foundation of the Templar Order by Hughes de Payens. He soon showed his military valour and his piety, and in 1136, after the death of Hughes, he was chosen as the new Grand Master. He proved to be a brilliant organizer and legislator, and turned the Order into a major force in the Crusader states. On March 29, 1139, Pope Innocent II issued the bull \"Omne Datum Optimum\", which exempted the order from tithes and made them independent of any ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The Templars were also granted the habit of a red cross over a white tunic, which has since become the popular image of any crusader.\n\nHe was less fortunate as a military leader. As soon as he had been elected, he defeated Zengi, the emir of Aleppo and let his knights plunder the enemy camp; Zengi returned and destroyed the unorganized pillagers. Robert authorized the Spanish Templars to lead a naval expedition of about 70 ships against Lisbon, but this also ended in defeat. In 1140 the Templars resisted a numerically superior Turkish army at the Battle of Tecua.\nIn 1143, after protracted negotiations between Raymond Berenguer IV (the Count of Barcelona and a Templar) the order's mission on the Iberian peninsula was defined. According to William of Tyre, Robert participated in the Council of Acre during the Second Crusade in 1148, but according to the \"Obituary of Reims\", he died in January 1147, and was succeeded by Everard des Barres in April that year. Some authors give a date of death of 13 January 1147.\n"}

Lee Marvin got 10% of the profits.\n\nFilming took place in Oroville, California, just outside Sacremento. \"It's enchanting here,\" Burton told the press during filming. \"It reminds me of my old valley in Wales.\"\n\nThe crew was based in a local motel. One motel room, next to the office, was filled with cases of alcohol, in rows, from floor to ceiling. Burton, Marvin, et al., were dealing with personal issues off the set, as well as what seemed a difficult shoot; but, all were professionals, despite the quantity of alcohol consumption, and were always on time and ready with their lines.\n\nRichard Burton allegedly drank so much alcohol during the making of this film that many of his scenes had to be shot with him seated or lying down, due to his inability to stand. In some scenes, he appears to slur his words or speak incoherently.\n\nBurton and wife Elizabeth Taylor were staying in a rented house in town. The crew passed around rumors of tension between them. As well as the big rumor among the crew, which concerned a shouting match (over a young girl from the town), which led them to throwing, first decor items, and then furniture at the walls of the house, which led to near complete destruction of the interior.\n\nBurton gave a young girl in town, Kim Dinucci, a $450 diamond ring and arranged for her to get a small walk-on part in the film as Lee Marvin's daughter. This made national news.\n\nIt may have caused Taylor's visit and the altercation; but according to the crew, Burton was using the young girl as a cover for his real affair with a local married woman (with children) who was working on the location shoot. When the woman left her husband and children to meet him in LA, he had changed his mind and had decided to reunite with Taylor.\n\nDuring one late night shoot, due to ongoing lighting issues, Burton wound up lying on the cold, damp ground for over an hour, with no protection under him and without an overcoat. Finally by 3 AM, after he had read and reread his line, over and over, and he was nearly frozen and completely exhausted, the 30 second scene was deemed properly lit. And that was the shot that was used in the film. After the last shot, he had to be lifted to his feet and wrapped in a blanket.\n\nBurton went to hospital after filming and was treated on bronchitis. While he was staying there it was announced Burton and Taylor would be getting divorced. Burton ended up residing in hospital for six weeks.\n\nWalter Schiffin later said Burton should not have been paid \"at all considering the performance he gave. He was... drinking three quarts a day. He didn't know what town he was in let alone what film.\" Schiffin says that, in contrast, Lee Marvin \"was highly helpful throughout the shooting.\"\n\nAldo Tonti, the cinematographer who had worked on \"Reflections in a Golden Eye\", was also the cinematographer on this film, though he was not credited.\n\nLee Marvin later said his character was meant to be a war hero and had a son who did not want to go to West Point. There was a subplot where Burton's character sided with the son. All this was cut from the final film. In addition, Marvin was not paid a final $50,000 owed to him.\n\nWhile the film was being edited at Sam Goldwyn Studios, the studios caught fire.\n\nAt the last minute, one of the investors failed to come up with the money so Marvin and Burton were not paid their full salary and Paramount put a lien on the film.\n\nFuller said he later met Terence Young when both were members of the Festival du Film Policier de Cognac. Though Fuller originally had a grudge against Young, he was won over by Young's insistence that he had never read the original script and had only accepted the direction of the film to pay debts. Fuller admired his honesty.\n\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" called it \"a thoroughly clumsy adaptation of William Bradford Huie's novel\", adding that the filmmakers \"effectively defuse the very real drama by so lovingly depicting the horrors that one comes to suspect their motives. As the movie progresses, the events comes to seem less and less urgent and particular to a specific time and place, and more and more like the automatic responses to the demands of cheap, easy melodrama.\" Arthur D. Murphy of \"Variety\" declared it \"a perfect example of screen trash that almost invites derision ... There's not a shred of quality, dignity, relevance or impact in this yahoo-oriented bunk\". Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film one star out of four and called it \"a tawdry rip-off of a half-dozen films: \"In the Heat of the Night\", \"The Liberation of L.B. Jones\", \"tick ... tick ... tick\" ... what's amazing about this drivel is that Lee Marvin and Richard Burton lent their talents to it. They must have been offered a very sweet deal, because \"The Klansman\" is pure demagogery\". Charles Champlin of the \"Los Angeles Times\" slammed the film as \"one of those sleazy, exploitative, incompetent pieces of motion picture waste which makes you suddenly unsure that film reviewing is a fit occupation for a grown man ... If any frame of the film carried a convincing sense of the real tensions, fears, hatreds and tempers of the rural American South you might be able to forgive some of the rest. But the acting is so amateurish in the lesser roles as to be comical and the dialogue in the major roles is unplayable.\" Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" called it \"the sort of film that raises only academic questions. Could the original source, a novel by William Bradford Huie, have been as terrible as the movie? Probably not, but it must have given the screenwriters, Millard Kaufman and Sam Fuller, a few ugly situations to kick around, like a castration and a pair of interracial rapes and a shootout with the Ku Klux Klan, and they've proceeded to kick them around like champion Hollywood hacks, leaning hard on the exploitation elements and reducing characterization and social analysis, if there were any, to a bare minimum\".\n\nAlexander, Young and Burton were meant to make a film with Robert Mitchum and Charlotte Rampling called \"Jackpot\" but it was never made.\n\n\n"}

There were 76 episodes across four series, the first broadcast on 22 January 2001 and the last on 31 July 2004.\n\nThe series focused on six young adults who lived in London. Each episode was presented from a different character's point of view, which up to that point in time had never been done before in a comedy-drama television programme. The programme had a cult following and received critical acclaim. It was considered groundbreaking and was compared to another British serial drama \"Hollyoaks\". \n\nPart of the programme's identity was the style, such as surreal fly-on-the-wall style camera work, fast camera transitions, wacky sound effects added to some scenes and the distinctive theme music (the tune \"Would you...?\" by the band Touch and Go). Episode four of the first series was awarded an RTS Television Award for Best Tape or Film Editing - Drama.\n\nSeveral notable episodes were centred around parodies of other films or TV shows, including \"The Blair Witch Project\" (episode 1x16); \"Moulin Rouge\" (2x20); \"The Italian Job\" (3x12) and \"24\" (4x04).\n\nIn the beginning, the gang was divided in two. We learn Sooz, Jamie and Alex are good friends. Jamie has a crush on Nikki, who he sees as a nice, innocent, delicate girl. Nikki was friends with Sasha, who was in a relationship with Rob. When Jamie invited Nikki to a fake party, the destinies of these six persons crossed and friendships were born. While Rob, Jamie and Alex became good friends, Nikki and Sasha didn't get along with Sooz, although the three had their moments together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApart from its well-known theme music, \"As If\" also used many popular songs in its 76 episodes. Trip hop music was used quite extensively, especially music by Massive Attack (and specifically songs from the album \"Mezzanine\") and Archive.\n\n\n"}

The College Area is dominated by San Diego State University (SDSU; once known as San Diego State College), after which the area is named. Several neighborhoods in the College Area were developed in the 1930s, with others becoming established in the post-war period. The College Area is bordered on the west by Kensington and Talmadge and on the east by the city of La Mesa. El Cajon Boulevard is a busy shopping district; additional retail is in development near SDSU.\n\nThe College Area includes the neighborhoods of the Catoctin Area, Dennstedt Point, East Falls View Drive, Saranac-Mohawk, and an Orthodox Jewish neighborhood in the area near Congregation Beth Jacob Orthodox Synagogue on College Avenue. The region includes Alvarado Hospital, a 306-bed acute care facility, and the College-Rolando branch of the San Diego Public Library.\n\nOn August 18, 1948, the \"Campus Drive-In\" movie theater with a capacity for 900 cars was built at the intersection of College Avenue and El Cajon Boulevard. The opening night films were Give My Regards to Broadway and The Kansan. The final two features in 1983 were The Dark Crystal and Dragonslayer. \n\nIn 1961, snack-bar employee Tom O'Leary was convicted of manslaughter for stabbing a patron named Dennis O'Connor to death at the drive-in. The O'Connor family sued the company for wrongful death but did not prevail. The dead man's family became active in city politics and eventually his sister Maureen O'Connor was elected mayor of San Diego in 1986. \n\nThree neon drum majorettes wearing Indian headdresses from the Drive-In are preserved in the Vons shopping center at this location and one large one is preserved in the College Grove Shopping Center in Rolando Park.\n\nThe college area lies on a plateau which overlooks Interstate 8. The neighborhood's borders are defined by Montezuma Road/Collwood Boulevard to the southwest, Interstate 8 to the north, 73rd Street to the east, and El Cajon Boulevard to the south.\n\nMTS (Metropolitan Transit System) operates the San Diego Trolley to SDSU Transit Center and the Alvarado Medical Center trolley station, both of which are in the College Area. The trolley station at SDSU, as well as a bus plaza, make up the SDSU Transit Center. Bus routes 11, 11A, 14, 936, and Rapid Bus 215 go to the Transit Center, to name a few. Transfers are made from the SDSU trolley subway station located at the Transit Center, underneath the bus plaza. Riders can go up to the bus plaza via elevator or stairs.\n\nAs of October 12, 2014, the SDSU Transit Station serves as the starting point for MTS Rapid Bus Route 215. A high-frequency, limited-stop service runs between San Diego State University and Downtown San Diego via El Cajon Boulevard and Park Boulevard. This route provides a convenient transit option for visitors and nearby neighbors from downtown San Diego, North Park and Hillcrest to shop and dine in the busy commercial corridor. \n\nAll mass transit routes noted enable visitors from the San DIego region to explore San Diego State University's beautiful campus and enjoy the leisure, arts and culture provided by this institution of higher learning.\n\nThe College Area is accessible from Interstate 8, State Route 94. Surface streets entering into the College Area include 70th Street (accessible from I-8), College Avenue (accessible from I-8 and SR94) and 54th Street and Montezuma Road (accessible from I-8). Built in July 2005 there is also a mass transit connection by MTS San Diego Trolley accessing the SDSU on-campus underground station. Traffic can be high during the day however, local residents and City officials working together to increase pedestrian and bicycle routes and modifying the street infrastructure to eleviate any congestion in the area as the population grows in the neighborhoods.\n\nThe college area is home to one traditional elementary school, one private K-8 school, two alternative K-8 schools, and SDSU.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1887608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887608", "title": "Esperantido", "text": "Esperantido\n\nAn Esperantido is a constructed language derived from Esperanto. \"Esperantido\" originally referred to the language which is now known as Ido. The word \"Esperantido\" is derived from \"Esperanto\" plus the affix \"-id-\" (\"-ido\"), which means a \"child (\"born to a parent\"), young (\"of an animal\") or offspring\" (\"ido\"). Hence, \"Esperantido\" literally means an \"offspring or descendant of Esperanto\".\n\nA number of Esperantidos have been created to address a number of perceived flaws or weaknesses in Esperanto, or in other Esperantidos, attempting to improve their lexicon, grammar, pronunciation, and orthography. Others were created as language games or to add variety to Esperanto literature.\n\nThese attempted improvements were intended to replace Esperanto. Limited suggestions for improvement within the framework of Esperanto, such as orthographic reforms and riism, are not considered Esperantidos.\n\n\"Mundolinco\" (1888) was the first Esperantido, created in 1888. Changes from Esperanto include combining the adjective and adverb under the suffix \"-e\", loss of the accusative and adjectival agreement, changes to the verb conjugations, eliminating the diacritics, and bringing the vocabulary closer to Latin, for example with superlative \"-osim-\" to replace the Esperanto particle \"plej\" \"most\".\n\nZamenhof himself proposed several changes in the language in 1894, which were rejected by the Esperanto community and subsequently abandoned by Zamenhof himself.\n\nIdo (1907), the foremost of the Esperantidos, sought to bring Esperanto into closer alignment with Western European expectations of an ideal language, based on familiarity with French, English, and Italian. Reforms included changing the spelling by removing non-Roman letters such as \"ĉ\" and re-introducing the k/q dichotomy; removing a couple of the more obscure phonemic contrasts (one of which, , has been effectively removed from standard Esperanto); ending the infinitives in \"-r\" and the plurals in \"-i\" like Italian; eliminating adjectival agreement, and removing the need for the accusative case by setting up a fixed default word order; reducing the amount of inherent gender in the vocabulary, providing a masculine suffix and an epicene third-person singular pronoun; replacing the pronouns and correlatives with forms more similar to the Romance languages; adding new roots where Esperanto uses the antonymic prefix \"mal-\"; replacing much of Esperanto's other regular derivation with separate roots, which are thought to be easier for Westerners to remember; and replacing much of the Germanic and Slavic vocabulary with Romance forms, such as \"navo\" for English-derived \"ŝipo\". See the Ido \"Pater noster\" below.\n\nIdo spawned its own idos, the first being Adjuvilo (1908), which was created by an Esperantist to sow dissent in the Ido community.\n\nRené de Saussure (brother of linguist Ferdinand de Saussure) published numerous Esperantido proposals, starting with a response to Ido later called \"Antido 1\" (\"Anti-Ido 1\") in 1907, which increasingly diverged from Esperanto before finishing with a more conservative Esperanto II in 1937. Esperanto II replaced \"j\" with \"y\", \"kv\" with \"q\", \"kz\" with \"x\", and diacritic letters with \"j\" (\"ĵ\" and \"ĝ\"), \"w\" (\"ŭ\"), and digraphs \"sh\" (\"ŝ\"), \"ch\" (\"ĉ\"); replaced the passive in \"-iĝ-\" with \"-ev-\", the indefinite ending \"-aŭ\" with adverbial \"-e\", the accusative \"-on\" on nouns with \"-u\", and the plural on nouns with \"-n\" (so \"membrun\" for \"membrojn\" \"members\"); dropped adjectival agreement; broke up the table of concords, changed other small grammatical words such as \"ey\" for \"kaj\" \"and\", and treated pronouns more like nouns, so that the plural of \"li\" \"he\" is \"lin\" rather than \"ili\" \"they\", and the accusative of \"ĝi\" \"it\" is \"ju\".\n\nRomániço (1991) is designed to be more intuitive for native speakers of English. It replaces vocabulary and some grammar with Romance constructions, allows a somewhat more irregular orthography, and eliminates some criticized points such as case, adjectival agreement, verbal inflection for tense and mood, and inherent gender, but retains the \"o, a, e\" suffixes for parts of speech and an agglutinative morphology. It is intended as a compromise between Esperanto and naturalistic conlangs such as Interlingua.\n\n\"Esperanto sen Fleksio\" (Esperanto without inflexion), proposed under this name by Richard Harrison in 1996 but based on long-term complaints from Asian Esperantists, is an experimental and unfinished proposal for a morphologically reduced variety of Esperanto. The main changes are:\n\n\nIn an earlier version, the letter \"ŭ\" was replaced with \"w\", but the more recent version uses the same alphabet as regular Esperanto.\n\nWhile most Esperantidos aim to simplify Esperanto, \"Poliespo\" (\"polysynthetic Esperanto\", ) makes it considerably more complex. Besides the polysynthetic morphology, it incorporates much of the phonology and vocabulary of the Cherokee language. It has fourteen vowels, six of them nasalized, and three tones.\n\nThere are also extensions of Esperanto created primarily for amusement.\n\nOne of the more interesting Esperantidos, grammatically, is \"Universal\" (1923–1928). It adds a schwa to break up consonant clusters, marks the accusative case with a nasal vowel, has inclusive and exclusive pronouns, uses partial reduplication for the plural (\"tablo\" \"table\", \"tatablo\" \"tables\"), and inversion for antonyms (\"mega\" \"big\", \"gema\" \"little\"; \"donu\" \"give\", \"nodu\" \"receive\"; \"tela\" \"far\", \"leta\" \"near\"). Inversion can be seen in:\n\nThe antonyms are \"al\" \"he\" and \"la\" \"she\" (compare \"li\" \"s/he\"), the \"ge-\" (completive) and \"eg-\" (inchoative) aspects, \"fin-\" \"to finish\" and \"nif-\" \"to begin\", and \"graf-\" \"to write\" and \"farg-\" \"to read\".\n\nThe \"Universal\" reduplicated plural and inverted antonyms are reminiscent of the musical language Solresol.\n\n\"Esperant’\" () is a style of speech that twists but does not quite violate the grammar of Esperanto.\n\nThe changes are morphological:\n\nExample:\n\nLiterally, \"Behold (the) love of group of boys to the pretty-girl.\"\n\nSee the Esperant’ \"Pater noster\" below.\n\nThere are various projects to adapt Esperanto to specialized uses. \"Esperanto de DLT\" (1983) is one; it was an adaptation of Esperanto as a pivot language for machine translation.\n\nEsperanto has little in the way of the slang, dialectical variation, or archaisms found in natural languages. Several authors have felt a need for such variation, either for effect in original literature, or to translate such variation from national literature.\n\nOccasionally, reform projects have been used by Esperanto authors to play the role of dialects, for example standard Esperanto and Ido to translate a play written in two dialects of Italian. \n\nHalvelik (1973) created \"\" (\"Popular Idiom\") to play the role of a substandard register of Esperanto that, among other things, does away with much of Esperanto's inflectional system. For example, standard Esperanto\n\nis in Popido,\n\nIn 1969, he published part I of the Sociolekto Triopo, Arkaika Esperanto to serve as equivalent to Middle English, Middle High German and the like.\n\nA slang completes the trio, called .\n\nProto-Esperanto would theoretically fulfill the need for archaism, but too little survives for it to be used extensively. In 1931 Kalman Kalocsay published a translation of the Funeral Sermon and Prayer, the first Hungarian text (12th century), in which he created fictitious archaic forms as though Esperanto were a Romance language deriving from Vulgar Latin.\n\nManuel Halvelik went further in 1969 with a book on \"Arcaicam Esperantom,\" where he laid out the grammar of a fictitious ancestor of modern Esperanto. It echoes Proto-Esperanto in a more complex set of inflections, including dative and genitive cases ending in \"-d\" and \"-es\" and separate verbal inflections for person and number, as well as \"retention\" of digraphs such as \"ph\" and \"tz,\" writing \"c\" for , and the use of the letters \"q\", \"w\", \"x\", \"y\".\n\nThe Esperanto Pater noster follows, compared to the Ido, \"Esperant’\" and \"Arcaicam Esperantom\" versions.\n"}
