His father, Patrick Bergin snr., was a Labour Party politician, who had once studied to be a priest with the Holy Ghost Fathers in Blackrock, Ireland. Patrick is one of four sons and one daughter (Pearse, Emmet, Patrick, Allen and Siobhan Bergin). Bergin left Dublin for London in 1973, and by the time he was seventeen, was in London running a theatre group. Bergin worked on building sites and at a library. He studied at night and completed a degree in education from North London Polytechnic. Bergin worked as an English teacher for several years before forming his own theatrical company because no one else would have him.\n\nIn 1980, Bergin decided to pursue acting full-time and he found work in repertory theatre. For much of the Nineties it seemed like no one in Hollywood would have him. So he made his own way; he worked in diverse films such as a trilogy of Yeats plays; \"Morphine and Dolly Mixtures\", for which he won a Welsh Best Actor Award and \"Durango\", based on John B Keane's novel; hosting \"TnaG's Silín Draíochta\"; and narrating \"Patrick Cassidy's Famine Concert\". After \"Sleeping with the Enemy\" (1991), his reputation grew and he was offered the lead in \"Robin Hood\" with Uma Thurman. He describes 1996 as the lowest point in his career, a time when he rarely received any phone calls for movie roles.\n\nInternationally, his best-known role may be that of the menacing husband of Julia Roberts' character in the thriller \"Sleeping with the Enemy\" and is also known for his role as Irish terrorist Kevin O'Donnell in the film adaptation of \"Patriot Games\". Bergin also appeared as in Robin Hood in a 1991 TV film. In 2013 he appeared in the Scottish film \"The Wee Man\" playing notorious Glasgow gangster Arthur 'The Godfather' Thompson. Bergin joined the BBC soap \"EastEnders\" towards the end of 2017, departing in March 2018.\n\nCurrently, he leads Patrick Bergin and the Spirit Merchants. Bergin had a top 10 hit in Ireland with the song \"The Knacker\", which tells the story of a person who recycles horse carcasses and turns them into glue. As a singer Patrick collaborated with Vlad DeBriansky and appeared on the record of Jacks Last Dollar.\nHe also appeared in the video of DJ Steve Mac's song \"Paddy's Revenge\".\n\nBergin was onstage singing the Leonard Cohen song \"Anthem\" as Pope Francis, on his visit to Ireland, arrived in Croke Park for the Festival of Families, part of the World Meeting of Families 2018.\n\nIn 1993, Bergin bought an old church in Tipperary and converted it into a poetry centre. Bergin explained, \"I've recently come to feel I can encourage children and teenagers with their writing. I'm continually giving groups money to make videos, but I insist that they have a good script. I do it because it makes the difference between them doing a video or not. It doesn't cost a lot, and it gives kids an incredible boost of confidence.\" In 1998, in response to the murder of a 14-year-old Tallaght boy, Ben Smyth, Bergin participated in setting up a special fund to sponsor young children from Tallaght.\n\nIn the early 1980s, at a wedding, he met his future wife, Paula Frazier, a British woman of Afro-Caribbean descent. Bergin and Frazier married in Trinidad and Tobago in 1992. They have a daughter named Tatiana (called Tia). Bergin and his wife later divorced, whereupon he began dating Helen Goldin.\n\nCage (2018) as Peter Karl Bradley\n"}

It entails proving whether a solution exists for all 7th-degree equations using algebraic (variant: continuous) functions of two arguments. It was first presented in the context of nomography, and in particular \"nomographic construction\" — a process whereby a function of several variables is constructed using functions of two variables. The variant for continuous functions was resolved in 1957 by Vladimir Arnold when he proved the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, but the variant for algebraic functions remains unresolved. \n\nHilbert considered the seventh-degree equation\n\nand asked whether its solution, \"x\", considered as a function of the three variables \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\", can be expressed as the composition of a finite number of two-variable functions.\n\nHilbert originally posed his problem for algebraic functions (Hilbert 1927, \"...Existenz von algebraischen Funktionen...\", i.e., \"...existence of algebraic functions...\"; also see Abhyankar 1997, Vitushkin 2004). However, Hilbert also asked in a later version of this problem whether there is a solution in the class of continuous functions. \n\nA generalization of the second (\"continuous\") variant of the problem is the following question: can every continuous function of three variables be expressed as a composition of finitely many continuous functions of two variables? The affirmative answer to this general question was given in 1957 by Vladimir Arnold, then only nineteen years old and a student of Andrey Kolmogorov. Kolmogorov had shown in the previous year that any function of several variables can be constructed with a finite number of three-variable functions. Arnold then expanded on this work to show that only two-variable functions were in fact required, thus answering the Hilbert's question when posed for the class of continuous functions.\n\nArnold later returned to the algebraic version of the problem, jointly with Goro Shimura (Arnold and Shimura 1976).\n\n\n"}

Wholly owned by Trans States Holdings, it has 1,670 employees. It operates commuter feeder services under the United Express brand of United Airlines and recently completed a multi-year service agreement for Delta Airlines under the Delta Connection brand. United Express flights are currently operated out of United's hubs at Chicago–O'Hare and Newark. GoJet's Delta Connection branded flights came to an end on March 31, 2020. Most of the flying at the end of the agreement was out of Detroit and Minneapolis–St. Paul as well as Raleigh-Durham. GoJet Airlines system operations center (SOC), training center, and corporate offices are co-located in the former Trans World Airlines and Ozark Airlines training center in Bridgeton, Missouri. The airline uses the former McDonnell Douglas factory hangar at Saint Louis Lambert International as its primary maintenance facility with maintenance staff available at all of the airlines domiciles. Its call sign \"Lindbergh\" is named for aviation pioneer Charles Lindbergh, who flew the \"Spirit of St. Louis\" solo across the Atlantic Ocean in 1927, the first person to do so.\n\nThe airline was established in late 2004 by Trans States Holdings. The airline would fly United Express branded flights out of United Airlines’s Chicago O’Hare hub to replace departing United Express carrier Atlantic Coast Airlines. GoJet took delivery of their first Bombardier CRJ-700 in June 2005.\n\nThe airline received its initial Air Carrier Operating Certificate in September 2005 and began scheduled passenger services on October 4, 2005 with a United Express flight from Cincinnati, Ohio to Chicago, Illinois. By the end of 2009, GoJet took delivery of their 25th CRJ-700 aircraft.\n\nIn October 2011, Delta Air Lines announced it was planning a January 2012 launch of new GoJet CRJ700 service as a Delta Connection regional carrier. Delta would initially transfer 15 of the CRJ700 aircraft previously assigned to its Comair division to GoJet as well as 12 owned or leased CRJ700s contracted to SkyWest Airlines to begin the service. On January 22, 2012, GoJet began service as a Delta Connection carrier with its inaugural flight from St. Louis, Missouri to Detroit, Michigan. In late 2013 GoJet agreed to increase its flying agreement for Delta by leasing several CRJ-900 aircraft for its Delta Connection service through 2023. GoJet began this CRJ-900 service in late 2014.\n\nIn August 2019, Delta announced that it would be terminating operating agreements with two of it Delta Connection branded carriers, GoJet Airlines and Compass Airlines. The CRJ-700 aircraft operated by GoJet for Delta Airlines will be transferred to Endeavor Air or sold to other operators. The CRJ-900 aircraft that were leased by GoJet for the Delta Connection brand were also eventually re-leased by other Delta connection carriers. As part of the announcement all GoJet operated flights on behalf of Delta Airlines were to be phased out by mid-2020. After the COVID-19 virus nearly reduced travel demand to zero bookings Delta Airlines and GoJet Airlines agreed to terminate service early and park all remaining Delta Connection aircraft on March 31, 2020.\n\nIn April 2020 Trans States Holdings closed GoJet's two sister airlines, Trans States Airlines and Compass Airlines due to challenging economic issues and an unsustainable business environment related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPilots and flight attendants as well as maintenance personnel are based at the following locations:\n\nGoJet flies to over 80 destinations within the U.S. and Canada, operating for United Express. Below are destinations per a 2017 route map.\n\nAs of May 2020, the GoJet Airlines fleet consists of the following aircraft:\n\nThe GoJet fleet of CRJ-700s that are flown for United Express are equipped with engines like those on the CRJ-900 series, the General Electric CF34-8C5B1. All of these aircraft are being converted to CRJ-550’s. GoJet operated CRJ-900 aircraft from 2014-2020 that it leased for Delta Airlines. At the beginning of April 2020, GoJet stopped flying the CRJ-900 when the company completed its service contract with Delta Airlines.\n\nOn February 6, 2019, United Airlines and Bombardier Aviation announced that GoJet would be the first regional carrier to operate 54 CRJ-550s, a new 50-seat aircraft based on the CRJ-700, starting in the summer of 2019. In February 2020 United Airlines ordered 20 more CRJ-550 aircraft to the GoJet Fleet to be delivered through 2021. These aircraft will be transferred from other United Express carriers to GoJet. Once these CRJ-700 aircraft are converted to the 50 seat arrangement the CRJ-550 fleet at GoJet will total 74 aircraft. Given the difficulties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, United Airlines and GoJet in cooperation with Bombardier Aviation stopped the conversion process of the CRJ-700 fleet in late March 2020 until after the full economic fallout of the virus is evaluated. It is not yet fully known how this work stoppage will affect the proposed CRJ-550 fleet plan.\n\nThe United Express CRJ-550 is a modified Bombardier CRJ-700. Bombardier Aviation does not produce the CRJ-550 new from the factory. Many CRJ-550 aircraft are several years old in the GoJet fleet, the oldest (N503GJ) being close to 20 years old. CRJ-500 conversions are done on both the classic CRJ-700 and the NextGen CRJ-700 models. The process of converting the aircraft cabin is a relatively quick process where several economy seats of the 700 series are removed and replaced with large storage cabinets, a larger more modern service galley and updated First Class and Economy Plus seating. The four new cabinets installed at floor level allow passengers to stow larger carry on luggage in the cabin with them that would normally have needed to be checked plane side when on the CRJ-700. The new larger service galley allows passengers with first class seats the option of self serve snacks and beverages during the flight. The galley features a lighted glass cabinet with several snack options, a refrigerator with chilled non-alcoholic beverages, ice and bottled water drawers as well as a waste receptacle. For the cabin crew the new galley features a storage area for crew luggage. In the cabin the aircraft features 10 full size first class seats, 20 Economy Plus seats and 20 Economy seats. The whole aircraft receives new wall panels, carpeting, curtains, and signage. United is having all the CRJ-550 aircraft painted in their new blue and white livery. For pilots the aircraft is essentially a CRJ-700 with limited takeoff and landing weights to meet the United Airlines scope agreement with its pilots who are represented by the Airline Pilots Association. This agreement limits the CRJ-550 to a maximum takeoff weight of 65,000 pounds, 10,000 pounds less than the CRJ-700. The CRJ-550 is often restricted from taking full passenger loads when flying into areas where more precautionary fuel is needed such as areas with poor weather due to this reduced weight limit.\n\n\n"}

Their lyrics were in English and Spanish, often mixing both languages in a single song or even line. Human and animal rights are frequent subjects in their lyrics. The band mixes punk music with other genres such as reggae, pop, tango, thrash metal and others.\n\nAs the band became well known, skinheads who enjoyed the band's aggressive music in a violent way started to show up at concerts, prompting singer Nekro to call the band's genre \"anti-fascist gay hardcore\" in an attempt to get rid of those fans. For this reason Fun People is sometimes confused as queercore.\n\nEarly on, the band was called Anesthesia (as a tribute to Cliff Burton). When the band was about to release their first album, planned to be self-titled, they found out someone else had already copyrighted \"Anesthesia\" as a band name. \"Fun People\", the name of a fanzine Nekro made and sold at the band's concerts, was chosen as the band's new name and \"Anesthesia\" remained as the album's title.\n\nFun People was a famous band, under which was left to be, or a half-under, which at its inception had been within the Hardcore / Punk, with an occasional tendency to Grindcore, but also owns a sometimes melodic Hardcore (Play \"Anesthesia\", her first album). Now in its second plate turned into a great combo as versatile as effective and convincing, to include issues of Trash Metal, Ska, Pop song sixty to 100% (the classic \"Chew\"), Reggae, Rock to dry (e.g.: Pilar, Poorman), turning a little closer to power pop, always within the framework of Punk, \"Kum-Kum\" is a lightning-fast turning point in his career. The third album by Fun People are more raw, more hardcore, without losing the good and catchy melodies, including a beautiful ballad (\"Point Of Lovely Sun\"), a very delicate folk song (\"Rainbow\"), and a cover Frontal Attack, a track as fast as direct (\"I am not part of this!\") and closes with a song that was part of their first demo, still under the name \"Anesthesia.\" The fourth album from long-term study is \"The Art (e) of Romance\", recorded and produced by Steve Albini, famous for his work with the likes of Page / Plant, Nirvana and The Pixies, recorded entirely in United States is a very eclectic album (which now standard at this point) with a photo on the cover of Kurt Gustav Wilckens, the Vindicator, with super powerful and super fast tracks, themes Punk Rock, Rock, or simply as \"Middle of the Rounds\", a sad and tragic ballad about the letter and \"Leave Me Alone\", a bit of Trash (\"One Day (Like Wilckens)\"), more trash ...(\"¿Where Are You?\"), a topic with very good effects console flirting with electronics (\"December\") and closes with a theme a capella that reminds some commercial era of post-war 50's in America (with a little imagination, of course) . The latest album under the name of Fun People was titled \"Sorrow, No, No\", and is, as is described by the singer at the time, a \"return to roots\", a disc with almost more minutes on their topics have, super fast, furious, almost no time to breathe when you hear it, the truth is it is a good bounce, a more shrill and less Nekro Tyrol, and now has almost the same training to accompany the singer on stage soloist (the same lineup except for Gori, who had joined FP in the year 98 after the departure of Lucas) on this album, just with an a cappella singing Tanguito Nekro. The band apart from having in his repertoire album with studio albums, has several simple and published EP (\"The Fun People Experience\"), which marks the debut of Gori on an album of the band, and the difference is, Gori's style is more rock, with peanuts and worthy of a rock licks of law and good arrangements, Lucas instead had a more raw sound and saturated, Heavy if you will. In those rare-but very abundant at a time-5 years (1995-2000) of life, Fun People released 5 studio albums, a disc with demos and excerpts from concerts (one radial acoustic and electric in the city of Chicago) and with the inclusion of 2 covers, a couple of singles, a 6-song EP and an album with all acoustic versions of \"golden hits\" from the band (\"Gori & Nekro - Golden Hits\") \"This is very unlikely, since the band never had\" golden hits \"on commercial terms and / or mass-media, and editing a home video of a concert of the band in their beginnings in the theater Harlequins , 1995 year entitled \"When the sun sets\".\n\nThey performed for the last time in a surprise show (that was not announced in the media) for many fans that found out about this gig through internet and other means, approx. 9 years ago.\n\nThey remain widely admired by people in the Hardcore music scene, despite being criticized by many other HC bands for their general anti macho attitude, so common in the scene .\n\nJhonathan Scarcha leaves the band again and Nekro gets fully involved in his new soloist project: Boom Boom Kid. Pelado and Chelo accompany him until nowadays. Lucas Sequeira fronts Cucsifae since his departure from Fun People in 97. Gori now fronts Fantasmagoria. Chuli played for a while in Satan Dealers while Gato is currently playing in a Spanish Band called Phogo.\nFun People got reunited in three different occasions, although they never announce themselves officially, letting people learn about the reunion by word of mouth. The first reunion was in 2003, at Trivenchi Shed. The line-up consisted of Nekro, Gori, Jhonathan, Pelado and Chelo. They played twice in the same night due to the great call. The second reunion was in 2005, the gig was announced as a Boom Boom Kid show but Gori showed up and they reviewed songs of their old band. Finally, their last reunion was in 2010. According to Nekro, he was planning to do something with Gori when they decided spontaneously to go on a summer tour. The band is temporarily inactive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The problem is to put Schubert's enumerative calculus on a rigorous foundation.\n\nSplitting the question, as now it would be understood, into Schubert calculus and enumerative geometry, the former is well-founded on the basis of the topology of Grassmannians, and intersection theory. The latter has status that is less clear, if clarified with respect to the position in 1900.\n\nWhile enumerative geometry made no connection with physics during the first century of its development, it has since emerged as a central element of string theory.\n\nThe entirety of the original problem statement is as follows:\n\nThe problem consists in this: To establish rigorously and with an exact determination of the limits of their validity those geometrical numbers which Schubert especially has determined on the basis of the so-called principle of special position, or conservation of number, by means of the enumerative calculus developed by him.\n\nAlthough the algebra of today guarantees, in principle, the possibility of carrying out the processes of elimination, yet for the proof of the theorems of enumerative geometry decidedly more is requisite, namely, the actual carrying out of the process of elimination in the case of equations of special form in such a way that the degree of the final equations and the multiplicity of their solutions may be foreseen.\n\nSchubert calculus is a branch of algebraic geometry introduced in the nineteenth century by Hermann Schubert, in order to solve various counting problems of projective geometry (part of enumerative geometry). It was a precursor of several more modern theories, for example characteristic classes, and in particular its algorithmic aspects are still of current interest.\n\nThe objects introduced by Schubert are the Schubert cells, which are locally closed sets in a Grassmannian defined by conditions of incidence of a linear subspace in projective space with a given flag.

It concerns the expression of positive definite rational functions as sums of quotients of squares. The original question may be reformulated as:\n\n\nThe formulation of the question takes into account that there are non-negative polynomials, for example\n\nwhich cannot be represented as a sum of squares of other polynomials. In 1888, Hilbert showed that every non-negative homogeneous polynomial in \"n\" variables and degree 2\"d\" can be represented as sum of squares of other polynomials if and only if either (a)\n\"n\" = 2 or (b) 2\"d\" = 2 or (c) \"n\" = 3 and 2\"d\" = 4. Hilbert's proof did not exhibit an explicit example: only in 1967 the first explicit example was constructed by Motzkin.\n\nThe particular case of \"n\" = 2 was already solved by Hilbert in 1893. The general problem was solved in the affirmative, in 1927, by Emil Artin, for positive semidefinite functions over the reals or more generally real-closed fields. An algorithmic solution was found by Charles Delzell in 1984. A result of Albrecht Pfister shows that a positive semidefinite form in \"n\" variables can be expressed as a sum of 2 squares.\n\nDubois showed in 1967 that the answer is negative in general for ordered fields. In this case one can say that a positive polynomial is a sum of weighted squares of rational functions with positive coefficients.\n\nA generalization to the matrix case (matrices with polynomial function entries that are always positive semidefinite can be expressed as sum of squares of symmetric matrices with rational function entries) was given by Gondard, Ribenboim and Procesi, Schacher, with an elementary proof given by Hillar and Nie.\n\nIt is an open question what is the smallest number\n\nsuch that any \"n\"-variate, non-negative polynomial of degree \"d\" can be written as sum of at most formula_3 square rational functions over the reals.\n\nThe best known result () is\n\ndue to Pfister in 1967.\n\nIn complex analysis the Hermitian analogue, requiring the squares to be squared norms of holomorphic mappings, is somewhat more complicated, but true for positive polynomials by a result of Quillen. The result of Pfister on the other hand fails in the Hermitian case, that is there is no bound on the number of squares required, see D'Angelo–Lebl.\n\n\n"}

She maintained her position in New Orleans society until April 10, 1834, when rescuers responded to a fire at her Royal Street mansion. They discovered bound slaves in her attic who showed evidence of cruel, violent abuse over a long period. LaLaurie's house was subsequently sacked by an outraged mob of New Orleans citizens. She escaped to France with her family.\n\nThe mansion traditionally held to be LaLaurie's is a landmark in the French Quarter, in part because of its history and for its architectural significance. However, her house was burned by the mob, and the \"LaLaurie Mansion\" at 1140 Royal Street was in fact rebuilt after her departure from New Orleans.\n\nMarie Delphine Macarty was born in New Orleans, Spanish Louisiana on March 19, 1787, as one of five children. Her father was Louis Barthelemy de McCarty (originally \"Chevalier de MacCarthy\"), whose father Barthelemy (de) MacCarthy brought the family to New Orleans from Ireland around 1730, during the French colonial period. (The Irish surname MacCarthy was shortened to \"Macarty\" or \"de Macarty\".) Her mother was Marie-Jeanne L'Érable, also known as \"the widow Le Comte\", as her marriage to Louis B. Macarty was her second.\n\nBoth of Delphine's parents were prominent in the town's European Creole community. Her uncle by marriage, Esteban Rodríguez Miró, was governor of the Spanish American provinces of Louisiana and Florida during 1785–1791, and her cousin, Augustin de Macarty, was mayor of New Orleans from 1815 to 1820.\n\nDelphine was only four years of age when the Haitian Revolution erupted in 1791, something that made slaveholders in the Southern United States and the Caribbean very afraid of resistance and rebellion among slaves; Delphine's uncle had been murdered in 1771 by his own slaves and the revolution had inspired the local Mina Conspiracy in 1791, the Pointe Coupée Conspiracy in 1794, and the German Coast Uprising in 1811, all of which caused many slaveholders to discipline slaves even more harshly out of fear of insurrection.\n\nOn June 11, 1800, Delphine married Don Ramón de Lopez y Angulo, a \"Caballero de la Royal de Carlos\", a high-ranking Spanish royal officer, at the Saint Louis Cathedral in New Orleans. \"Luisiana\", as it was spelled in Spanish, had become a Spanish colony in the 1760s after France was defeated in the Seven Years' War.\n\nIn 1804, after the American acquisition of what was then again a French territory, Don Ramón had been appointed to the position of consul general for Spain in the Territory of Orleans, and was called to appear at the court of Spain. While en route to Madrid with Delphine, who was then pregnant, Don Ramón suddenly died in Havana. A few days after his death, Delphine gave birth to his daughter Marie-Borja/Borgia Delphine Lopez y Angulo de la Candelaria, nicknamed \"Borquita\". The widowed Delphine and her child returned to New Orleans.\n\nIn June 1808, Delphine married Jean Blanque, a prominent banker, merchant, lawyer, and legislator. At the time of the marriage, Blanque purchased a house at 409 Royal Street in New Orleans for the family, which became known later as the Villa Blanque. Delphine had four children by Blanque, named Marie Louise Pauline, Louise Marie Laure, Marie Louise Jeanne, and Jean Pierre Paulin Blanque. Blanque died in 1816.\n\nOn June 25, 1825, Delphine married her third husband, physician Leonard Louis Nicolas LaLaurie, who was much younger than she. In 1831, she bought property at 1140 Royal Street, which she managed in her own name with little involvement of her husband. In 1832 she had a 2-story mansion built there, complete with attached slave quarters. She lived there with her third husband and two of her daughters, and maintained a central position in New Orleans society.\n\nThe marriage soon showed signs of strain, however; on November 16, 1832, Delphine petitioned the First Judicial District Court for a separation from bed and board of her husband, in which Delphine claimed that LaLaurie had \"treated her in such a manner as to render their living together unsupportable\", claims which her son and two of her daughters by Jean Blanque confirmed. The separation does not seem to have been permanent, as Dr. LaLaurie was present at the Royal Street house April 10, 1834, the day of the fire.\n\nAccounts of Delphine LaLaurie's treatment of her slaves between 1831 and 1834 are mixed. Harriet Martineau, writing in 1838 and recounting tales told to her by New Orleans residents during her 1836 visit, claimed LaLaurie's slaves were observed to be \"singularly haggard and wretched;\" however, in public appearances LaLaurie was seen to be generally polite to black people and solicitous of her slaves' health.\n\nFuneral registers between 1830 and 1834 document the deaths of twelve slaves at the Royal Street mansion, although the causes of death are not mentioned and infectious diseases could easily have been the cause. These twelve deaths include Bonne, a cook and laundress, and her four children, Juliette (c. 1820-February 21, 1833), Florence (c. 1821- February 16, 1831), Jules (c. 1827- May 29, 1833), and Leontine (c. 1829- August 26, 1831). Bonne (c. 1803-February 7, 1833) had previously belonged to a refugee from Saint Domingue and was described in her sale as \"a chronic runaway\"; with an influx of white and free colored Saint Dominguen refugees and their slaves, the fear of slaves from Saint Domingue still lingered in Louisiana.\n\nCourt records of the time showed that LaLaurie freed two of her slaves (Jean Louis in 1819 and Devince in 1832). Martineau wrote that public rumors about LaLaurie's mistreatment of her slaves were sufficiently widespread that a local lawyer was dispatched to Royal Street to remind LaLaurie of the laws for the upkeep of slaves. During this visit, the lawyer found no evidence of wrongdoing or mistreatment of slaves by LaLaurie.\n\nMartineau also recounted other tales of LaLaurie's cruelty that were current among New Orleans residents in about 1836. She said that, subsequent to the visit of the lawyer, one of LaLaurie's neighbors saw one of her slaves, a girl of about eight years, fall to her death from the roof of the Royal Street mansion while trying to avoid punishment from a whip-wielding LaLaurie. The body was subsequently buried on the mansion grounds. Jeanne DeLavigne, in her 1945 account, gave the child's age as twelve years and gave her a name, Lia (or Leah). Later writers elaborated on the case, saying that Lia had been brushing Delphine's hair when she hit a snag, causing LaLaurie to grab a whip and chase her.\n\nAccording to Martineau, this incident led to an investigation of the LaLauries, in which they were found guilty of illegal cruelty and forced to forfeit nine slaves. These nine slaves were bought back by the LaLauries through an intermediary relative, and returned to the Royal Street residence. Similarly, Martineau recounted stories that LaLaurie kept her cook chained to the kitchen stove, and beat her daughters when they attempted to feed the slaves.\n\nOn April 10, 1834, a fire broke out in the LaLaurie residence on Royal Street, starting in the kitchen. When the police and fire marshals got there, they found the cook, a seventy-year-old woman, chained to the stove by her ankle. She later said that she had set the fire as a suicide attempt because she feared being punished. She said that slaves taken to the uppermost room never came back.\n\nAs reported in the \"New Orleans Bee\" of April 11, 1834, bystanders responding to the fire attempted to enter the slave quarters to ensure that everyone had been evacuated. Upon being refused the keys by the LaLauries, the bystanders broke down the doors to the slave quarters and found \"seven slaves, more or less horribly mutilated ... suspended by the neck, with their limbs apparently stretched and torn from one extremity to the other\", who claimed to have been imprisoned there for some months.\n\nOne of those who entered the premises was Judge Jean-Francois Canonge, who subsequently deposed to having found in the LaLaurie mansion, among others, a \"negress ... wearing an iron collar\" and \"an old negro woman who had received a very deep wound on her head [who was] too weak to be able to walk.\" Canonge said that when he questioned LaLaurie's husband about the slaves, he was told in an insolent manner that \"some people had better stay at home rather than come to others' houses to dictate laws and meddle with other people's business.\" A version of this story circulating in 1836, recounted by Martineau, added that the slaves were emaciated, showed signs of being flayed with a whip, were bound in restrictive postures, and wore spiked iron collars which kept their heads in static positions.\n\nWhen the discovery of the abused slaves became widely known, a mob of local citizens attacked the LaLaurie residence and \"demolished and destroyed everything upon which they could lay their hands\". A sheriff and his officers were called upon to disperse the crowd, but by the time the mob left, the property had sustained major damage, with \"scarcely any thing [remaining] but the walls.\" The slaves were taken to a local jail, where they were available for public viewing. The \"Bee\" reported that by April 12 up to 4,000 people had attended to view the slaves \"to convince themselves of their sufferings.\"\n\nThe \"Pittsfield Sun\", citing the \"New Orleans Advertiser\" and writing several weeks after the evacuation of LaLaurie's slave quarters, claimed that two of the slaves found in the mansion had died since their rescue. It added, \"We understand ... that in digging the yard, bodies have been disinterred, and the condemned well [in the grounds of the mansion] having been uncovered, others, particularly that of a child, were found.\" These claims were repeated by Martineau in her 1838 book \"Retrospect of Western Travel\", where she placed the number of unearthed bodies at two, including the child Lia.\n\nLaLaurie's life after the 1834 fire is not well documented. Martineau wrote in 1838 that LaLaurie fled New Orleans during the mob violence that followed the fire, taking a coach to the waterfront and traveling, by schooner, to Mobile, Alabama and then to Paris. By the time Martineau personally visited the Royal Street mansion in 1836, it was still unoccupied and badly damaged, with \"gaping windows and empty walls\".\n\nLiving with his mother and two sisters, Pauline and Laure, in exile in Paris, Delphine's son Paulin Blanque wrote in August 15, 1842, to his brother-in-law, Auguste DeLassus, stating that Delphine was serious about returning to New Orleans and had thought about doing so for a long time. Blanque wrote in the same letter that he believed that his mother never had any idea about the reason for her departure from New Orleans. Despite Delphine's \"bad mood\" and her determination to return to New Orleans, the disapproval of her children and other relatives had apparently been enough for her to cancel her plan.\n\nThe circumstances of LaLaurie's death are also unclear. In 1888, George Washington Cable recounted a popular but unsubstantiated story that LaLaurie had died in France in a boar-hunting accident. In the late 1930s, Eugene Backes, who served as sexton to St. Louis Cemetery #1 until 1924, discovered an old cracked, copper plate in Alley 4 of the cemetery. The inscription on the plate read \"\"Madame Lalaurie, née Marie Delphine Maccarthy, décédée à Paris, le 7 Décembre, 1842, à l'âge de 6--.\"\" The English translation of the inscription reads: \"Madame Lalaurie, born Marie Delphine Mccarthy, died in Paris, December 7, 1842, at the age of 6-- \" According to the French archives of Paris, however, LaLaurie died on December 7, 1849, at the age of 62.\n\nThe original New Orleans mansion occupied by LaLaurie does not survive. The impressive mansion at 1140 Royal Street, on the corner of Governor Nicholls Street (formerly known as Hospital Street), commonly referred to as the LaLaurie or Haunted House, is not the same building inhabited by LaLaurie. When she acquired the property in 1831 from Edmond Soniat Dufossat, a house was already under construction and finished for LaLaurie.\n\nThis house was burned by the mob in 1834 and remained in a ruined state for at least another four years. It was then rebuilt by Pierre Trastour after 1838 and assumed the appearance that it has today. Over the following decades, it was used as a public high school, a conservatory of music, an apartment building, a refuge for young delinquents, a bar, a furniture store, and a luxury apartment building.\n\nThe dwelling had a third floor and rear building added later in the 19th century, and the rear building on Governor Nicholls Street, which had only one floor until a second one was added in the 20th century, was remodeled in the 1970s when the second floor interior of the building was done over by Koch and Wilson, architects. At three stories high, it was described in 1928 as \"the highest building for squares around\", with the result that \"from the cupola on the roof one may look out over the Vieux Carré and see the Mississippi in its crescent before Jackson Square\".\n\nThe entrance to the building bears iron grillwork, and the door is carved with an image of \"Phoebus in his chariot, and with wreaths of flowers and depending garlands in bas-relief\". Inside, the vestibule is floored in black and white marble, and a curved mahogany-railed staircase runs the full three stories of the building. The second floor holds three large drawing rooms connected by ornamented sliding doors, whose walls are decorated with plaster rosettes, carved woodwork, black marble mantle pieces and fluted pilasters.\n\nIn April 2007, actor Nicolas Cage bought the house for a sum of $3.45 million. To protect the actor's privacy, the mortgage documents were arranged in such a way that Cage's name did not appear on them. On November 13, 2009, the property, then valued at $3.5 million, was listed for auction as a result of foreclosure and purchased by Regions Financial Corporation for $2.3 million.\n\nFolk histories of LaLaurie's abuse and murder of her slaves circulated in Louisiana during the 19th century, and were reprinted in collections of stories by Henry Castellanos and George Washington Cable. Cable's account (not to be confused with his unrelated 1881 novel \"Madame Delphine\") was based on contemporary reports in newspapers such as the \"New Orleans Bee\" and the \"Advertiser\", and upon Martineau's 1838 account, \"Retrospect of Western Travel\". He added some of his own synthesis, dialogue, and speculation.\n\nAfter 1945, accounts of the LaLaurie slaves became more explicit. Jeanne deLavigne, writing in \"Ghost Stories of Old New Orleans\" (1946), alleged that LaLaurie had a \"sadistic appetite [that] seemed never appeased until she had inflicted on one or more of her black servitors some hideous form of torture\" and claimed that those who responded to the 1834 fire had found \"male slaves, stark naked, chained to the wall, their eyes gouged out, their fingernails pulled off by the roots; others had their joints skinned and festering, great holes in their buttocks where the flesh had been sliced away, their ears hanging by shreds, their lips sewn together ... Intestines were pulled out and knotted around naked waists. There were holes in skulls, where a rough stick had been inserted to stir the brains.\" DeLavigne did not cite any sources for these claims, and they were not supported by the primary sources.\n\nThe story was further embellished in \"Journey Into Darkness: Ghosts and Vampires of New Orleans\" (1998) by Kalila Katherina Smith, the operator of a New Orleans ghost tour business. Smith's book added several more explicit details to the discoveries allegedly made by rescuers during the 1834 fire, including a \"victim [who] obviously had her arms amputated and her skin peeled off in a circular pattern, making her look like a human caterpillar,\" and another who had had her limbs broken and reset \"at odd angles so she resembled a human crab\". Many of the new details in Smith's book were unsourced, while others were not supported by the sources given.\n\nToday, modern re-tellings of the LaLaurie legend often use DeLavigne and Smith's versions of the tale as the basis for claims of explicit tortures, and number the slaves who died under LaLaurie's care at as many as one hundred.\n\nLaLaurie was portrayed by Kathy Bates in \"American Horror Story: Coven\".\n\nMadame LaLaurie was briefly mentioned in the fictional supernatural TV series [the Originals] (Season 4, Episode 6) in a list of violent clusters occurring in the city of New Orleans. Vincent Griffith believed that her violent acts were part of a cluster of such acts influenced by the malevolent spirit known as the Hollow.\n\n\nGeneral:\n\n\n\n\n"}

This was answered affirmatively by Bieberbach.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks whether there exists a polyhedron which tiles 3-dimensional Euclidean space but is not the fundamental region of any space group; that is, which tiles but does not admit an isohedral (tile-transitive) tiling. Such tiles are now known as anisohedral. In asking the problem in three dimensions, Hilbert was probably assuming that no such tile exists in two dimensions; this assumption later turned out to be incorrect.\n\nThe first such tile in three dimensions was found by Karl Reinhardt in 1928. The first example in two dimensions was found by Heesch in 1935. The related einstein problem asks for a shape that can tile space but not with an infinite cyclic group of symmetries.\n\nThe third part of the problem asks for the densest sphere packing or packing of other specified shapes. Although it expressly includes shapes other than spheres, it is generally taken as equivalent to the Kepler conjecture.\n\nIn 1998 American mathematician Thomas Callister Hales gave a computer-aided proof of the Kepler conjecture. It shows that the most space-efficient way to pack spheres is in a pyramid shape.\n\n"}

It asks whether the solutions of regular problems in the calculus of variations are always analytic. Informally, and perhaps less directly, since Hilbert's concept of a \"\"regular variational problem\"\" identifies precisely a variational problem whose Euler–Lagrange equation is an elliptic partial differential equation with analytic coefficients, Hilbert's nineteenth problem, despite its seemingly technical statement, simply asks whether, in this class of partial differential equations, any solution function inherits the relatively simple and well understood structure from the solved equation. Hilbert's nineteenth problem was solved independently in the late 1950s by Ennio De Giorgi and John Forbes Nash, Jr.\n\nDavid Hilbert presented the now called Hilbert's nineteenth problem in his speech at the second International Congress of Mathematicians. In he states that, in his opinion, one of the most remarkable facts of the theory of analytic functions is that there exist classes of partial differential equations which admit only such kind of functions as solutions, adducing Laplace's equation, Liouville's equation, the minimal surface equation and a class of linear partial differential equations studied by Émile Picard as examples. He then notes the fact that most of the partial differential equations sharing this property are the Euler–Lagrange equation of a well defined kind of variational problem, featuring the following three properties:\nHilbert calls this kind of variational problem a \"\"regular variational problem\"\": property means that such kind of variational problems are minimum problems, property is the ellipticity condition on the Euler–Lagrange equations associated to the given functional, while property is a simple regularity assumption the function . Having identified the class of problems to deal with, he then poses the following question:-\"\"... does every Lagrangian partial differential equation of a regular variation problem have the property of admitting analytic integrals exclusively?\"\" and asks further if this is the case even when the function is required to assume, as it happens for Dirichlet's problem on the potential function, boundary values which are continuous, but not analytic.\n\nHilbert stated his nineteenth problem as a regularity problem for a class of elliptic partial differential equation with analytic coefficients, therefore the first efforts of the researchers who sought to solve it were directed to study the regularity of classical solutions for equations belonging to this class. For solutions Hilbert's problem was answered positively by in his thesis: he showed that solutions of nonlinear elliptic analytic equations in 2 variables are analytic. Bernstein's result was improved over the years by several authors, such as , who reduced the differentiability requirements on the solution needed to prove that it is analytic. On the other hand, direct methods in the calculus of variations showed the existence of solutions with very weak differentiability properties. For many years there was a gap between these results: the solutions that could be constructed were known to have square integrable second derivatives, which was not quite strong enough to feed into the machinery that could prove they were analytic, which needed continuity of first derivatives. This gap was filled independently by , and . They were able to show the solutions had first derivatives that were Hölder continuous, which by previous results implied that the solutions are analytic whenever the differential equation has analytic coefficients, thus completing the solution of Hilbert's nineteenth problem.\n\nThe affirmative answer to Hilbert's nineteenth problem given by Ennio De Giorgi and John Forbes Nash raised the question if the same conclusion holds also for Euler-lagrange equations of more general functionals: at the end of the 1960s, , and constructed independently several counterexamples, showing that in general there is no hope to prove such kind of regularity results without adding further hypotheses.\n\nPrecisely, gave several counterexamples involving a single elliptic equation of order greater than two with analytic coefficients: for experts, the fact that such kind of equations could have nonanalytic and even nonsmooth solutions created a sensation.\n\nThe key theorem proved by De Giorgi is an a priori estimate stating that if \"u\" is a solution of a suitable linear second order strictly elliptic PDE of the form\nand formula_4 has square integrable first derivatives, then formula_4 is Hölder continuous.\n\nHilbert's problem asks whether the minimizers formula_6 of an energy functional such as\nare analytic. Here formula_6 is a function on some compact set formula_9 of R, formula_10 is its gradient vector, and formula_11 is the Lagrangian, a function of the derivatives of formula_6 that satisfies certain growth, smoothness, and convexity conditions. The smoothness of formula_6 can be shown using De Giorgi's theorem\nas follows. The Euler–Lagrange equation for this variational problem is the non-linear equation\nand differentiating this with respect to formula_15 gives\nThis means that formula_17 satisfies the linear equation\nwith \nso by De Giorgi's result the solution \"w\" has Hölder continuous first derivatives, provided the matrix formula_20 is bounded. When this is not the case, a further step is needed: one must prove that the solution formula_6 is Lipschitz continuous, i.e. the gradient formula_10 is an formula_23 function.\n\nOnce \"w\" is known to have Hölder continuous (\"n\"+1)st derivatives for some \"n\" ≥ 1, then the coefficients \"a\" have Hölder continuous \"n\"th derivatives, so a theorem of Schauder implies that the (\"n\"+2)nd derivatives are also Hölder continuous, so repeating this infinitely often shows that the solution \"w\" is smooth.\n\nNash gave a continuity estimate for solutions of the parabolic equation\nwhere \"u\" is a bounded function of \"x\"...,\"x\", \"t\" defined for \"t\" ≥ 0. From his estimate Nash was able to deduce a continuity estimate for solutions of the elliptic equation \n\n"}

The game features professional inline skaters, including Chris Edwards, Eito Yasutoko, Franky Morales, Jaren Grob and Taïg Khris.\n\nA different game of the same name was developed by Full Fat and released for the Game Boy Advance.\n\nThe gameplay focuses on completing goals given by talking to characters within each level. While some goals involve gaining a certain number of points in a specific time, many of the goals involve doing tricks on and off of pieces of the environment (for example: one level asks the player to grind three traffic lights, each one placed at a larger distance and facing a different direction). Another innovative feature focused on a player leveling system where the player would perform better in different areas of skating skill by practicing them repeatedly. For instance, if the player does many air tricks throughout the course of the game, each successful trick would create points in the player's air trick statistics. When the points reach a certain number, the player's air tricks will move up a level, making it easier to perform air tricks faster and more efficiently. The same actions apply to grinding, speed, wall riding, skating backward, etc.\n\nThe game received praise for its wide and interactive environments, comfortable control scheme, and innovative gameplay. At the time, it was considered to be a breakthrough competitor to the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series, even being the first to include some elements that would later become standard in the Tony Hawk games, most notably not confining players to rigidly timed play sessions. In addition, the ability to transition from one trick to another seamlessly without having to do any actions in between made for a more streamlined combo system than the Tony Hawk series and most other action sports titles at the time, where players had to perform transition maneuvers such as ollies or flips to link one trick to another - although some fans of the genre considered this aspect of Aggressive Inline's trick system \"too easy.\" The game generally received good reviews for its style of play, with the average review ratio for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Gamecube being 85%, with the Game Boy Advance version receiving worse scores than the versions on consoles (mainly because the GBA version had more of a \"do these goals, hit this score, reach the finish\" system than console).\n\n"}

It asks whether all boundary value problems can be solved (that is, do variational problems with certain boundary conditions have solutions).\n\nHilbert noted that there existed methods for solving partial differential equations where the function's values were given at the boundary, but the problem asked for methods for solving partial differential equations with more complicated conditions on the boundary (e.g., involving derivatives of the function), or for solving calculus of variation problems in more than 1 dimension (for example, minimal surface problems or minimal curvature problems)\n\nThe original problem statement in its entirety is as follows:\n\nAn important problem closely connected with the foregoing [referring to Hilbert's nineteenth problem] is the question concerning the existence of solutions of partial differential equations when the values on the boundary of the region are prescribed. This problem is solved in the main by the keen methods of H. A. Schwarz, C. Neumann, and Poincaré for the differential equation of the potential. These methods, however, seem to be generally not capable of direct extension to the case where along the boundary there are prescribed either the differential coefficients or any relations between these and the values of the function. Nor can they be extended immediately to the case where the inquiry is not for potential surfaces but, say, for surfaces of least area, or surfaces of constant positive gaussian curvature, which are to pass through a prescribed twisted curve or to stretch over a given ring surface. It is my conviction that it will be possible to prove these existence theorems by means of a general principle whose nature is indicated by Dirichlet's principle. This general principle will then perhaps enable us to approach the question: Has not every regular variation problem a solution, provided certain assumptions regarding the given boundary conditions are satisfied (say that the functions concerned in these boundary conditions are continuous and have in sections one or more derivatives), and provided also if need be that the notion of a solution shall be suitably extended?\n\nIn the field of differential equations, a boundary value problem is a differential equation together with a set of additional constraints, called the boundary conditions. A solution to a boundary value problem is a solution to the differential equation which also satisfies the boundary conditions.\n\nTo be useful in applications, a boundary value problem should be well posed. This means that given the input to the problem there exists a unique solution, which depends continuously on the input. Much theoretical work in the field of partial differential equations is devoted to proving that boundary value problems arising from scientific and engineering applications are in fact well-posed.\n\n"}

{"id": "2336257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2336257", "title": "Cherchez la femme", "text": "Cherchez la femme\n\nCherchez la femme () is a French phrase which literally means 'look for the woman'.\n\nThe expression comes from the novel \"The Mohicans of Paris\" \"()\" published 1854–1859 by Alexandre Dumas (père). The first use in the novel reads:\n\n\"Cherchez la femme, pardieu! cherchez la femme!\"\n\nIn English: \nLook for the woman, by God! Look for the woman!\n\nThe phrase is repeated several times in the novel. Dumas also used the phrase in his 1864 theatrical adaptation, which reads:\n\n\"Il y a une femme dans toutes les affaires; aussitôt qu'on me fait un rapport, je dis: « Cherchez la femme ! »\"\n\nTranslated into English this reads:\n\nThere is a woman in every case; as soon as someone brings me a report, I say, 'Look for the woman!'\n\nThe phrase embodies a cliché of detective pulp fiction: no matter what the problem, a woman is often the root cause. The phrase has thus come to refer to explanations that automatically find the same root cause, no matter the specifics of the problem. In his 1963 detective novel \"The Chill\", Ross Macdonald's sleuth Lew Archer offers a wry analysis of the concept, stating: \"When a woman is murdered, you ask her estranged husband where he was at the time. It's the corollary of \"cherchez la femme\".\"\n\nIn the 1931 film \"The Front Page\", the security guard called \"Woodenshoes\" (Spencer Charters), is convinced that Molly Malloy (Mae Clark) is hiding escaped prisoner, Earl Williams (George E. Stone). He keeps trying to tell everyone while repeatedly adding, \"cherchez la femme!\"\n\nIn the 1936 film \"My Man Godfrey\", Gail Patrick's character Cornelia Bullock complains about her little sister and Mischa Auer as Carlo replies, \"As the French say, cherchez la femme.\"\n\nIn the beginning of the film \"Gold Diggers of 1937\", Glenda Farrell says to the other chorus girls, \"Girls, from now on, you're looking at a new Genevieve. A gal who starts with that old Mountie slogan, \"Get your man.\" To which Joan Blondell replies, \"And ends with the old police slogan, 'cherchez la femme.'\"\n\nThe phrase is employed in the 1942 film \"Tales of Manhattan\". In the mock trial of Avery L. 'Larry' Browne (Edward G. Robinson's character), the inebriated classmate interjects \"cherchez la femme\". It also appears in the film \"Dr. No\" (1962).\n\nThe phrase appears in the 1958 film \"The Quiet American\" starring Michael Redgrave.\n\nThe phrase appears in the film \"Carry On Doctor\" (1967), where Fred (Julian Orchard) uses it in a more literal sense, simply referring to looking for a woman who Ken (Bernard Bresslaw) has seen and taken a fancy to.\n\nIn the Albanian film \"Kapedani\" (\"eng. Captain\") produced in 1972, actor Dario Llukaci acting as a taxi driver, says \"cherchez la femme\", meaning 'woman is the reason behind the quarrel'.\n\nThis phrase is utilized in \"Chinatown\" (1974) by Mrs Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) in response to JJ Gittes's (Jack Nicholson) reason for leaving the police force. \"Cherchez la femme. Was there a woman involved?\"\n\nIn the 1978 Beatles parody film \"All You Need Is Cash\" (aka \"The Rutles\"), Mick Jagger is interviewed by Eric Idle, who asks, \"Why did the Rutles break up?\" Mick replies, \"Women. Just women getting in the way. Cherchez la femme, you know.\"\n\nThe phrase occurs in the film \"Hopscotch\" in 1980 as Walter Matthau explains to a guy why he needs 500 dollars.\n\nThe phrase is used by Maggie Smith's character Daphne Castle to Peter Ustinov's character Hercule Poirot in the 1982 film \"Evil Under the Sun\", based on the novel by Agatha Christie, as they investigate the murder of Dianna Rigg's character Arlena Marshall.\n\nIn \"Frantic\" (1988), Harrison Ford's character Dr. Richard Wagner is talking to another doctor at \"The Blue Parrot\".\n\nIt also appears in the film \"Mallrats\" (1995) when Brodie, played by Jason Lee, spots his love interest, Rene, played by Shannen Doherty shopping in the mall.\n\nThe big band and swing-influenced disco band, Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band, had a number one U.S. dance hit, \"Cherchez La Femme\" (1976).\n\nThe last song on Fabulous Poodles 1977 eponymous debut is titled Cherchez La Femme.\n\nGhostface Killah's song \"Cherchez La Ghost\" (2000) samples the Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band and interpolates the phrase.\n\nThe phrase is used by American rock musician Brendan Benson in the song \"Biggest Fan\" from \"The Alternative to Love\" \n\nJoni Mitchell's song \"Dancin' Clown\", from 1988's \"Chalk Mark in a Rainstorm\", contains the phrase. An album note for the song on jonimitchell.com lists several artists as the \"Cherchez la femme chorus\".\n\nThe phrase appears in the novel \"Bluebeard\" (1987) by Kurt Vonnegut.\n\nSalman Rushdie's novel \"Shalimar the Clown\" (2005) uses the phrase in its final section, Kashmira.\n\nThe 1987 James Ellroy novel \"The Black Dahlia\" features the line as a motif throughout, first spoken by Officer Lee Blanchard to the main detective, Dwight \"Bucky\" Bleichert, as a piece of advice. \"Cherchez la femme, Bucky. Remember that.\" The line is repeated by Bucky's character throughout, and connects with its use in the rest of the genre.\n\nThe phrase also appears in the thirty-first book in the \"In Death\" series, strangers in death, written by J.D. Robb (pen name for Nora Roberts). it was spoken by Detective Delia Peabody to Lieutenant Eve Dallas, then from Lieutenant Eve Dallas to Detective Baxter\n\nThe 2009 Stephen King novel \"Under The Dome\" uses the phrase \"Cherchez la femme\", spoken by Thurston Marshall to Dale Barbara after Dale says \"You're looking for a woman named Piper Libby.\"\n\nThe phrase appears in the science-fiction short story \"The Flowered Thundermug\" by Alfred Bester. The phrase is spoken by a female character, alternatively named Violet Dugan/Audrey Hepburn. She is trying to hunt down a man who has, like herself, been transported five hundred years into a post-apocalyptic future by a freak accident. This man is the one who has stolen the \"flowered thundermug,\" now considered a twentieth-century Americana antique, but originating from his own time period. Possibly he has a female interest that could provide a lead to his whereabouts.\n\nChurchill \"Churchy\" LaFemme was the name of Pogo's turtle friend in Walt Kelly's comic strip \"Pogo\".\n\nThe son Jeff exclaims the phrase in an episode of The Donna Reed Show entitled \"Dough Re Mi\" (Season 1, Episode 9).\n\nThe phrase appears in the episode \"Rin Tin Tin and the Wild Stallion\" of the American children's television program \"The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin\".\n\nThe phrase is said by Maurice Minnifield (Barry Corbin) in the \"Northern Exposure\" episode \"Only You\" while talking to Chris Stevens (John Corbett).\n\nIn \"The West Wing\" Season 5, Episode 5, CJ Cregg makes the remark when talking about an old flame named Ben.\n\nIn \"In the Heat of the Night\" Season 4, Episode 6 (1990) Officer Parker Williams oddly makes the remark to Chief of Detectives Virgil Tibbs about a case.\n\nIn the TV series \"Witchblade\" (2001-2002) episode 3, \"Conundrum,\" Nottingham tells Sara \"Cherchez la femme,\" to lead her to the killer she is seeking. Later he tells her \"Cherchez la Jeune fille \" (Find the young girl) referencing the next potential victim.\n\nIn \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Viva Ned Flanders,\" Homer Simpson disparagingly refers to the very Christian Ned Flanders as ″Churchy La Femme″.\n\nIn the TV series \"Perry Mason\", \"The Case of the Married Moonlighter\" (first aired November 1958), actor Ray Collins as Lt.

A parody of the phrase is also used in the Series 2, Episode 2, \"The Hounds of Baskerville,\" where Sherlock states, \"Cherchez le chien.\"\n\nIn the \"NCIS\" Season 11, Episode 12, titled \"Kill Chain\", Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard (David McCallum) uttered the phrase to Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon), as the latter departed Autopsy. The body \"Ducky\" was examining had traces of Shalimar, a very expensive perfume.\n\nIn \"\" (2012), the phrase is used as the title of , which was the season finale.\n\nIn the TV detective series \"Mannix\", (12/09/73, E12), reference to the phrase is made by the police lieutenant when Mannix reports being assaulted after arriving at the airport. Mannix mentions a woman he met previously who met him at the airport, then disappeared. The lieutenant looks up the woman's reported name in a phone book, and hands it to Mannix.\n\nIn the mini-series \"I Am the Night\", (2019, E2), when reporter Jay Singletary, (Chris Pine), is told by his informant to \"find the woman\" that spent time at a convent and ultimately gave birth to (Fauna Hodel), the subject of his story.\n\nThe TV series \"Killjoys\" the title of episode 7 of season 5 is “Cherchez La Bitch”, a play on words of the phrase. It is apparently intended to recall the use of the phrase, while emphasizing the tough nature of the key characters in the episode, all of whom are women. It likely also involves some level of inside joke to both the fan base and the production crew, based on the prior run of the series and the proximity of the finale. Another layer is that they are looking for the true body of \"the lady.\"\n\n\n"}

Bobbie has directed both musicals and plays on Broadway and Off-Broadway, and was the Artistic Director of the New York City Center Encores! concert series. He directed the long-running revival of the musical \"Chicago\".\n\nBobbie was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania and attended the University of Scranton and did graduate work at The Catholic University of America. His family was Polish Roman Catholic, and his father was a coal miner.\nBobbie explains what inspired him to work in theater: \"My first Broadway show was \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,\" maybe in 1964. I came in to New York from college in Pennsylvania for the World's Fair...I remember sitting there — I practically had to be held down in my seat — and I had never seen anything like it. That day it was clear to me that I wanted to come back to New York, and theater was what I wanted to do. It was transforming.\"\n\nAs a performer, Bobbie played Roger in the Broadway production of \"Grease\" in 1972. He was featured in the 1976 Broadway revival of \"Going Up\", and he also starred on Broadway as Nicely-Nicely Johnson in the 1992 revival of \"Guys and Dolls\", for which he received a Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical.\n\nHe eventually turned his attention to directing, and in 1993 he wrote the book for, and directed, the Roundabout Theatre production of the Rodgers and Hammerstein revue \"A Grand Night for Singing\", for which he received a Tony Award nomination for Best Book of a Musical. The \"New York Times\" reviewer wrote of Bobbie's direction that he \"has given its Broadway elaboration an impressive fluidity that whisks the performers through various groupings with a minimum of stiffness and posturing. In Mr. Bobbie's hands, the songs flow together in a sequence that treats them as lighthearted extensions of one another.\"\n\nHe then directed the 1996 Broadway revival of \"Chicago\" with Ann Reinking and Bebe Neuwirth. Bobbie's 1996 revival of \"Chicago\" was inspired by his own staged concert production at City Center Encores!. The concert was a hit, and the musical moved directly to Broadway with its original \"Encores!\" cast. Ben Brantley, in reviewing the \"Encores!\" concert, noted \"As directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Ann Reinking, who also stars, 'Chicago' still stings like cheap whisky, but it also bubbles like vintage Champagne.\" He won the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical for \"Chicago\".\n\nBobbie next directed the Broadway productions of the stage musical \"Footloose\" in 1998, (he also co-wrote the book), the Roundabout Theater production of \"Twentieth Century\" with Alec Baldwin and Anne Heche, the 2005 \"Sweet Charity\" revival with Christina Applegate, and \"High Fidelity\" in 2006. The musical \"White Christmas\" which he directed had limited engagements on Broadway in November 2008 through January 2009 and again in November 2009 through January 2010. Bobbie received the 2009 Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Director of a Musical.\n\nHe co-wrote and directed a new musical, \"The Road to Hollywood\", which was performed at the Goodspeed Opera House in 2002. Bobbie directed the 2005 benefit concert for Carnegie Hall of \"South Pacific\", starring Reba McEntire and Brian Stokes Mitchell.\n\nBobbie directed the New York premiere of \"The Savannah Disputations\" by Evan Smith at the Off-Broadway Playwrights Horizons in 2009, with Marylouise Burke, Dana Ivey, Kellie Overby and Reed Birney. In regional theatre, he directed the new Terrence McNally play \"Golden Age\" at the Kennedy Center in 2010.\n\nBobbie was the artistic director of the New York City Center Encores! concert series in 1995 and 1996, and also directed the staged concerts of \"Fiorello!\" (1994), \"Tenderloin\" (2000), and \"Golden Boy\" (2002). For \"Du Barry Was a Lady\" (1996) he co-adapted the book. He directed the production of \"No, No, Nanette\" in 2008. He appeared in \"Face the Music\" in 2007 with \"The New York Times\" reviewer writing: \"A last, affectionate word for Mr. Bobbie, whose career took off in another direction when his staging of 'Chicago' for the Encores! series became a Broadway smash.

The new name was painted over the gates in December 1881.\n\nThe location of Washington Square once was the site of Corbett's Thatched Tavern. The city square was opened in 1818.\n\nAlong the east wall of the park is a monument to Gen. Pierre Beauregard, the Confederate general in charge of the city's defenses in 1862-1864. In 2004, the monument had repair work performed to correct a lean that had developed.\n\nIn May 1901, a bust of Henry Timrod was unveiled in the park.\n\nIn the center of the park is a memorial to the Washington Light Infantry.

Before that it was just lying there like a lox. The lyrics, well, a lot of the time I would write while the band were just playing the song and trying to figure it out. I would just be scatting along with them and I would just start going, 'Ooooooh, your hair is beautiful.'\" The word \"atomic\" in the song carries no fixed meaning and functions as a signifier of power and futurism. The bridge to, and the break in the melody before \"Atomic\" is spoken, is heavily influenced by the bridge in the song \"I'm on my way\" by Dean Parish.\n\nThe song was produced as a mixture of new wave, rock and disco which had proven to be so successful in their number-one single from earlier in 1979, \"Heart of Glass\". It is written in E natural minor (\"Call Me\" is written in D natural minor).\n\nThe 1980 single version of \"Atomic\" was a remix. The original 4:35 version as featured on the albums \"Eat to the Beat\" and 1981's \"The Best of Blondie\" opens with an intro inspired by the nursery rhyme \"Three Blind Mice\" and includes an instrumental break with a bass guitar solo. The 7″ version mixed by Mike Chapman omits the \"Three Blind Mice\" intro and replaces the instrumental break with a repeat of the verse.\n\nThe song became the band's third number one in the UK Singles Chart, where it held the top spot for two weeks. It reached the Top 40 in the US in Spring 1980.\n\nThe B-side was \"Die Young, Stay Pretty\", also from the album \"Eat to the Beat\", a reggae-influenced track, a style the band would perform again in their global chart-topper \"The Tide Is High\". The UK 12\" single contained a live cover version of Bowie's \"Heroes\" featuring Robert Fripp on guitar recorded at London's Hammersmith Odeon just a month before. The track was included on 1993's rarities compilation \"Blonde and Beyond\".\n\n\"Atomic\" was remixed and re-released in the UK in September 1994 where it peaked at #19 on the UK Top 40 singles chart. The subsequent April 1995 US release reached #1 on the \"Billboard\" Dance/Club Play Charts. The 1994 remix was included on the compilations \"The Platinum Collection\", \"Beautiful - The Remix Album\" and \"Remixed Remade Remodeled - The Remix Project\". The track was remixed again four years later for the UK compilation \"Atomic - The Very Best of Blondie\" and the '98 Xenomania mix was later included on the first \"Queer as Folk\" soundtrack album.\n\nThe music video depicts the band performing on stage at what looks like a post-apocalyptic nightclub in which Debbie Harry is wearing a garbage bag as a punkish futuristic costume. The audience at the club are also dressed in suitably futuristic costumes, and footage of a horseman with the \"Blondie: in the disco\" new year's concert advertisement. and an atomic explosion are also intercut.

{"id": "2336298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2336298", "title": "Theotokion", "text": "Theotokion\n\nA Theotokion (; pl. ) is a hymn to Mary the Theotokos (), which is read or chanted (troparion or sticheron) during the Divine Services (Canonical hours and Divine Liturgy) of the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches.\n\nAfter the condemnation of Nestorianism at the First Council of Ephesus in 431, the use of theotokia during the course of the Divine Services gradually increased. The inclusion of Theotokia in every service is sometimes accredited to Peter the Fuller, Patriarch of Antioch (471 - 488), a monophysite and ardent opponent of Nestorianism.\n\nTheotokia are almost part of every service in the Orthodox Church, but there are more specific forms among them. Theotokia often occur at the end of a series of troparia or stichera, usually after the verse: \"(Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit,) Both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.\"\n\nA Stavrotheotokion is a hymn to the Theotokos that refers to the Crucifixion of Christ. The correlation between the Theotokos and the Cross is natural because of the Virgin Mary's standing by the Cross throughout the Passion. Stavrotheotokia occurs most commonly on Wednesdays and Fridays, days which are dedicated to the commemoration of the Cross.\n\nThe theotokion that occurs at the end of \"Lord, I Have Cried\" at Vespers is called a Dogmaticon, because its text deals with the mystery of the Incarnation of Christ. The Little Entrance during Vespers is accompanied by the Dogmaticon as a processional troparion. The Dogmaticon is often chanted in a solemn manner, and while the choir is singing it the Deacon or Priest will cense the icon of the Theotokos on the Iconostasis. A Little Entrance is also made during the Divine Liturgy while the choir chants the theotokion that ends the Beatitudes.\n\nTheotokia of all types are found in the Horologion, Octoechos, Triodion, Pentecostarion and other liturgical books.\n\nThe longest and most popular devotion involving Theotokia is the Akathist to the Theotokos. This is solemnly chanted on the Fifth Saturday of Great Lent, and many other times during the year as both public and private devotions.\n\nTheotokarion (, , , ) is a book or collection of Eastern Orthodox hymns to Mary (\"theotokion\").\n\n\n"}

The company produced luxury automobiles from 1900 to 1915, with a factory at 3703 Mack Avenue, Detroit, Michigan.\n\nThe company was founded in Plattsburgh, New York by Henry Abrahm Lozier, an Indiana-born sewing machine and bicycle manufacturer.\n\nAfter selling his bicycle business, Lozier moved to Plattsburgh to manufacture boat engines. In 1900, he entered the automobile business. At his death in 1903, his son Harry took over the company.\n\nLoziers were top line luxury cars and for a time were the most expensive cars produced in the United States. The 1910 model line featured cars priced between US$4,600 and US$7,750. The same year, a Cadillac could be had for about US$1,600 and a Packard US$3,200. A pre-assembly line Ford Model T of the same year retailed at approximately US$850 (after installing assembly line production a few years later, new Model Ts sold for as little as US$240). The average annual salary in America that year was approximately US$750.\n\nThe company was moved to Detroit in 1910. In 1911, a Lozier was entered into the first running of the Indianapolis 500. The car, in the hands of Ralph Mulford, finished second in a controversial scoring decision and many observers felt Mulford's Lozier had actually won the race. On March 19 the same year, Lozier ads claimed, a stock 49 hp (37 kW) model piloted by Teddy Tetzlaff set a world record for 100 mi (160 km) at 1:14:29.\n\nBecause of Lozier's limited market niche, the company only produced a few thousand cars during its brief lifespan. Production peaked in the 1912 model year at 600 cars.\n\nThe company faced new pressures as more manufacturers entered the market. Frederick C. Chandler, Lozier's top designer, left the company in 1913 and formed the Chandler Motor Company which produced cars similar to the Lozier but at a substantially lower sales price. Chandler took several top company executives with him producing a brain drain from which the company never recovered.\n\nAt the 1913 Los Angeles Motordome, however, the company introduced the 88 hp (66 kW) Big Six, with electric headlights, with tourers and roadsters at US$5,000, limousines and landaulettes at US$6,500. It was joined by the 52 hp (40 kW) Light Six Metropolitan, with electric starter and lights; the tourer and runabout were US$3,250, coupe US$3,850, and limousine US$4,450.\n\nLozier tried to expand into the mid priced car market and in 1914 offered a four-cylinder car priced at US$2,000. It faced competition from the US$2000 Enger 40, the cheaper FAL at US$1750, the US$1600 Oakland 40, The Chalmers Super Six at US$3200, Cole Four at US$1925, and Western's US$500 Gale Model A roadster, to name just a few. The new four was not a sales success and company finances continued to falter. After a failed attempt to merge with Ford Motor Company, the company declared bankruptcy in 1915.\n\n\n\n"}

The stages of the intelligence cycle include the issuance of requirements by decision makers, collection, processing, analysis, and publication of intelligence. The circuit is completed when decision makers provide feedback and revised requirements. The intelligence cycle is also called the Intelligence Process by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the uniformed services. The intelligence cycle is an effective way of processing information and turning it into relevant and actionable intelligence.\n\nIntelligence requirements are determined by a decision maker to meet his/her objectives. In the federal government of the United States, requirements can be issued from the White House or the Congress. In NATO, a commander uses requirements (sometimes called Essential elements of information (EEIs)) to initiate the intelligence cycle.\n\nIn response to requirements, an intelligence staff develops an intelligence collection plan applying available sources and methods and seeking intelligence from other agencies. Collection includes inputs from several intelligence gathering disciplines, such as HUMINT (human intelligence), IMINT (imagery intelligence), ELINT (electronic intelligence), SIGINT (Signals Intelligence), OSINT (open source, or publicly available intelligence), etc.\n\nOnce the collection plan is executed and information arrives, it is processed for exploitation. This involves the translation of raw intelligence materials from a foreign language, evaluation of relevance and reliability, and collation of the raw intelligence in preparation for exploitation.\n\nAnalysis establishes the significance and implications of processed intelligence, integrates it by combining disparate pieces of information to identify collateral information and patterns, then interprets the significance of any newly developed knowledge.\n\nFinished intelligence products take many forms depending on the needs of the decision maker and reporting requirements. The level of urgency of various types of intelligence is typically established by an intelligence organization or community. For example, an indications and warning (I&W) bulletin would require higher precedence than an annual report.\n\nThe intelligence cycle is a closed loop; feedback is received from the decision maker and revised requirements issued.\n"}

It is located in Newark. Rutgers, founded in 1766 in New Brunswick, is the eighth oldest college in the United States and a member of the Association of American Universities. In 1945, the state legislature voted to make Rutgers University, then a private liberal arts college, into the state university and the following year merged the school with the former University of Newark (1936–1946), which became the Rutgers–Newark campus. Rutgers also incorporated the College of South Jersey and South Jersey Law School, in Camden, as a constituent campus of the university and renamed it Rutgers–Camden in 1950.\n\nRutgers–Newark offers undergraduate (bachelors) and graduate (masters, doctoral) programs to more than 12,000 students. It also offers cross-registration with the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) which borders its campus. The campus is located on 38 acres in Newark's University Heights section. The university host seven degree-granting undergraduate, graduate, and professional schools, including the Rutgers Business School (which has another campus in New Brunswick) and Rutgers Law School (which has another campus in Camden), and several research institutes, including the Institute of Jazz Studies. According to \"U.S. News & World Report\", Rutgers–Newark is the most diverse national university in the United States.\n\nRutgers–Newark officially came into existence in 1946, when the New Jersey State Legislature voted to make the University of Newark part of Rutgers University. The roots of Rutgers University, Newark, however, date back to 1908 when the New Jersey Law School first opened its doors. That law school, along with four other educational institutions in Newark — Dana College, the Newark Institute of Arts & Sciences, the Seth Boyden School of Business, and the Mercer Beasley School of Law — formed a series of alliances over the years. A final merger in 1936 resulted in the establishment of the University of Newark. A decade later, the University of Newark was absorbed into Rutgers University and became the school's Newark campus.\n\nAs a constituent unit of Rutgers University, ultimate authority for Rutgers–Newark rests with the central administration of the university, including its president and governing boards.\n\nHowever, the campus has its own chief executive (Nancy Cantor). Up until 2008, the chief executive was known as the provost, but then-president Richard L. McCormick changed the title of the chief executive to chancellor.\n\nRutgers–Newark is located on a campus of 38 acres in Newark's University Heights neighborhood. This neighborhood is within blocks of the commercial center of the city and located near mass transit (bus, rail, and light rail stations). The campus consists of seven degree-granting undergraduate, graduate and professional schools, including: Newark College of Arts and Sciences, University College, School of Criminal Justice, Graduate School-Newark, School of Public Affairs and Administration, Rutgers Business School-Newark and New Brunswick, and Rutgers Law School (Newark campus).\n\nThe Newark College of Arts and Sciences (NCAS) enrolls more than 60 percent of the undergraduates at Rutgers University in Newark and is the largest school on campus. With majors in almost 40 fields offering BA, BS, and BFA degrees.\n\nUniversity College–Newark offers undergraduate programs that cater to non-traditional or part-time adult students who have obligations during the day and attend class in the evening or on Saturday.\n\nRutgers–Newark offers MA, MS, MFA, and Ph.D. degrees.\n\nThe School of Public Affairs and Administration offers masters and doctoral degrees in public administration (MPA, Ph.D.).\n\nFounded in 1929, Rutgers Business School–Newark and New Brunswick offers undergraduate and graduate business programs on the Newark and New Brunswick campuses. Accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business International, Rutgers Business School awards B.S., Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) (including international executive and executive MBAs), and doctoral degrees in management.\n\nThe School of Criminal Justice is a national and international center for scholarly research on all aspects of policing, delinquency, crime, and criminal justice administration. The school also provides educational programs that fulfill public service obligations by helping to address the needs of criminal justice agencies within the city, state, nation, and world.\n\nThe Rutgers Law School (Newark campus) is the oldest law school in New Jersey.\n\n, Rutgers–Newark enrolls more than 11,000 students (more than 7,000 undergraduate, nearly 4,000 graduate). Rutgers–Newark awards approximately 80 doctoral degrees, 250 \"juris doctor\" degrees, 1,050 master's degrees, and 1,500 baccalaureate degrees each year and was ranked 12th in the nation for quality among small research universities by the 2005 Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index. The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education classifies the Rutgers–Newark campus as an institution with \"high research activity.\"\n\nThere are more than 500 full-time faculty members at Rutgers–Newark, 99 percent of whom hold doctor of philosophy or \"juris doctor\" degrees. Faculty on the Newark campus include or have included Pulitzer Prize recipients and members of the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the New York Academy of Medicine Fellow. A number of Rutgers–Newark faculty members have been awarded the prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship and named as Fulbright Fellows. Other faculty honors include the National Book Award, Japan's Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon, the Grete Lundbeck European Brain Research Foundation Award (\"The Brain Prize\"), the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers.\n\nSelect centers and institutes at Rutgers–Newark:\n\n\n\nIn 2006, The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching selected Rutgers–Newark as one of among a small pool of U.S. colleges and universities for the foundation's Community Engagement Classification. Specifically, The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching placed Rutgers–Newark in the foundation's Outreach and Partnerships category, recognizing the university for its ability to apply and provide collaboratively institutional resources that benefit both campus and community.\n\n\"U.S. News & World Report\" \"Best Colleges\" has named Rutgers University's Newark campus, the most [ethnically] diverse national university in the United States since 1997. Twenty-four percent of full-time undergraduate students enrolled in the fall of 2011 were white, 23 percent Asian, 23 percent Latino, 20 percent African American, 7 percent multiracial, multi-ethnic or unknown, and 2 percent foreign. More than 100 nations are represented in the student body.\n\nUndergraduate admissions to Rutgers–Newark are classified as “selective” by \"U.S. News & World Report\". Rutgers University in Newark receives almost 17,000 freshman and transfer applications and enrolls about 1,700 new students each year. Admissions decisions are based on academic potential as demonstrated by grades, grade-point average, class rank and test scores as well as extracurricular activities and demonstrated leadership such as volunteer work, school clubs and organizations, community service and paid employment.

He last played in Major League Baseball with the Houston Astros in 2008. During his career, he threw an 88–92 mph sinker, a big curveball, a slider, and a changeup.\n\nChacón was born in Anchorage, Alaska, but has only dim recollection of his biological mother and none of his father (he believes his biological father was African-American and his mother was Hispanic). His mother placed him in a Greeley, Colorado, foster home when he was aged four, and he was adopted by Tony and Blanca Chacón. Chacón was recruited by Arizona State, but chose to play professionally after he was drafted by the Colorado Rockies in the third round of the amateur draft. He signed on June 18, 1996.\n\nChacón made his MLB debut in as a member of the Rockies. In his first start, Chacon allowed seven runs in 5 1/3 innings while striking out eight en route to a 14-7 win. By the end of the 2001 season, Chacón made 27 starts and recorded a record of 6-10 for the Rockies.\n\nIn 2002, Chacón battled inconsistency and injuries throughout the season. He pitched in 13 starts in the first half, going 3-6 while having a stint on the DL. Once he returned, his season took a turn for the worse. In the second half he amassed an ERA of 7.00 in eight starts and was demoted to AAA. Chacón never was recalled back to the majors and finished the season with a record of 5-11 while walking 60 batters in 119 innings.\n\nChacón was Colorado's All-Star representative, having won 11 games before the All Star break; the only other Rockies pitchers to have done so through 2015 are Aaron Cook (2008), Jason Marquis (2009), and Ubaldo Jiménez (2010). He never got to pitch in the All-Star game due to a nagging elbow injury. He returned after the All-Star break and was winless in six starts, going 0-4. Chacon was then shut down for the rest of the season. He wound up finishing 11–8 with a 4.60 ERA.\n\nThe next year, due to a necessity at the closer role, he was converted into the Rockies closer for the 2004 season. Chacón put up one of the most bizarre stat lines in baseball history for a closer. Chacón was ninth in the National League with 35 saves but was also tied with a league leading nine blown saves. His record was 1–9 and his ERA 7.11. His home/road splits were even odder, as he was 1-5 at home with a 6.81 ERA and 20 saves. He allowed more hits than innings pitched, and while on the road his ERA was even worse, standing at 7.56 and notching only 15 saves. In 2005, Chacón was 1-7 with a career low 4.09 through 13 games before being traded mid season to the Yankees, ending his five-year tenure with the Rockies. A few months prior to the trade, Chacon told a sports reporter that nobody wanted to pitch at high altitude Coors Field because the ball would not curve in the light air. After Chacon went to the Yankees, Rockies manager Hurdle said that a player unhappy with the Rockies would leave quickly. He finished 24-45 in 150 games with 35 saves for the Rockies.\n\nHe was acquired by the Yankees in July 2005 for minor league pitchers Ramón Ramírez and Eduardo Sierra. Many New York fans and members of the tough New York media criticized the trade, calling it a bandage and not a solution, much like how the Yankees saw starts from Tim Redding, Darrell May and Sean Henn in 2005. Chacón was excited to be coming to New York, and he did not waver under the initial pressure and criticism. In his first start as a Yankee, he pitched six innings without allowing an earned run against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. He finished 7–3 with a 2.85 ERA for the Yankees. Chacón made his postseason debut in Game 4 of the 2005 American League Division Series against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. He pitched 6⅓ innings and allowed just 2 runs in a Yankee win.\n\nBefore the season, sportswriters thought that Chacón would be a big key to the Yankee rotation. Chacón, however, got off to a slow start, but started pitching well in late April. On May 16, the Texas Rangers scored 7 runs off Chacón. After the terrible start, Chacón went on the 15-day disabled list. Chacón came off the DL on June 11. After coming off the DL, Chacón could not pitch 5 innings, forcing the Yankees to use their tired bullpen. On July 6, Chacón was sent to the bullpen after giving up seven runs in 1⅓ innings against the Cleveland Indians on July 4. He was replaced in the rotation by Kris Wilson.\n\nDuring the July 31, 2006, mid-season non-waiver trade deadline, Chacon was dealt for Craig Wilson. Chacón started for the Pirates, making nine starts and going 2–3 with a 5.48 ERA.\n\nIn , Chacón was mainly used as a reliever by the Pirates, but also made four starts. He went 5–4 with a 3.94 ERA in 64 games for the Pirates in 2007. Chacón was granted free agency after the season.\n\nOn February 20, 2008, Chacón signed a one-year deal with the Houston Astros worth $2 million. On May 16, Chacón set a major league record by recording 9 consecutive no-decisions to begin a season.\n\nOn June 25, 2008, the Astros announced that Chacón was suspended indefinitely for insubordination after a physical altercation with Astros General Manager Ed Wade. The incident began after Chacón repeatedly refused to leave the team dining room to speak with Wade in his office. Chacón claimed that Wade raised his voice and verbally attacked him, telling him to \"look in the mirror\", though Wade has denied raising his voice or verbally attacking Chacón. In a fit of rage Chacón grabbed the much smaller Wade by the neck and threw him to the ground. When Wade tried to get up Chacón repeatedly knocked him back down before other players could intervene to stop the assault. On whether he regretted the incident Chacón stated \"If there's any regret, I just wish they had just let me alone\". Wade was not injured by the assault. The next day, Chacón was placed on waivers by the Astros and after clearing waivers, his contract was terminated with cause, meaning that Chacón forfeited $983,607 in salary (this move was appealed by the MLB Players' Association, but the termination with cause was upheld by an arbitrator in August 2010). Chacón did not pitch again in 2008.\n\nOn May 1, 2009, Chacón signed a one-year deal with the Newark Bears of the Atlantic League and started seven games, pitching to a 4.29 ERA with a 3–3 record. His performance with the Bears earned him a minor league contract with the Oakland Athletics organization on June 18, 2009. Pitching for AAA Sacramento, went 8–4 in 14 appearances (12 starts) with an ERA of 6.29.\n\nOn October 5, 2009 Chacón was arrested at a bowling alley in Greeley, Colorado, on charges related to unpaid gambling markers in Las Vegas, Nevada. He faced a felony charge in connection with three bad checks written for $50,000 to Caesars Palace. He was released from jail on October 6, after Las Vegas authorities decided not to extradite him.\n\n"}

Ruby was a granddaughter of Oliver Brewster and Martha Wadsworth Brewster, a poet and writer, and one of the earliest American female literary figures.\n\nHe was a descendant of Elder William Brewster (c. 1567 – April 10, 1644), the Pilgrim leader and spiritual elder of the Plymouth Colony and a passenger on the \"Mayflower\", and Governor William Bradford (1590–1657) of the Plymouth Colony and a passenger on the \"Mayflower\". He was also a 7th generation direct lineal descendant of Daniel Ladd, Sr. (1613–1693).\n\nHe early gave indications of the studious habits that characterized him through life. When he was eight years old his first savings, two dollars, were spent for a copy of Josephus and Plutarch, while when eighteen years of age he read Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.\n\nMost of his work in preparing for college was done by himself, only a portion of the time being given to the curriculum in the Painesville High School and at the college preparatory school of the Rev. Mr. Brayton in Painesville, Ohio.\n\nHe graduated from Western Reserve College in 1864 and from Andover Theological Seminary in 1869. He was ordained to the Congregational ministry on May 26, 1870. The degree of Doctor of Divinity (D.D. or DD, \"Divinitatis Doctor\" in Latin) was conferred on him by Western Reserve College in 1879; Yale University that of M.A. in 1881, Western Reserve College that of LL.D. in 1895, and Princeton University that of LL.D. in 1896.\n\nAfter graduation, he went into business with his father. His constant studies, however, seemed to turn his steps naturally toward a higher institution of learning, with the result that in 1866 he went to the Andover Theological Seminary.\n\nIn 1869, he was installed as the pastor of the Congregational Church in Edinburg, Portage County, Ohio, remaining here until 1871. In 1871 he began to preach at the Spring Street Congregational Church of Milwaukee, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin leaving in 1879. He was professor of intellectual and moral philosophy at Bowdoin College from 1879 to 1881, and 'Clark Professor of Metaphysics and Moral Philosophy' at Yale University (a professorship that still exists) from 1881 until 1901, when he took charge of the Graduate Department of Philosophy and Psychology. Ladd became Professor Emeritus in 1905, and retired in 1906.\n\nDuring 1879 to 1882 he lectured on theology at Andover Theological Seminary, and in 1883 at Harvard University, where during the time period of 1895 to 1896 he conducted a graduate seminar in ethics.\n\nBetween 1892 and 1899, at the invitation of the Government of Japan, he served as a diplomatic adviser and helped the Cabinet under Prime Minister Hirobumi Ito (1841–1909) to promote mutual understanding between Japan and the United States.\n\nHe lectured at Imperial University in Japan in 1892 and 1899 (when he also visited the universities of India in Calcutta, Bombay and Benares) and again from 1906 to 1907.\n\nThe series of lectures he delivered in Japan revolutionized its educational methods; In 1899, Emperor Meiji conferred the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon, which represents the third highest of eight classes associated with the award. Trumbull was again honored in 1907, this time with the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star, which represents the second highest of eight classes. He was the first foreigner to receive the honor in this class. He was a member of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nHe was much influenced by the German philosopher Hermann Lotze, whose \"Outlines of Philosophy\" he translated (6 vols., 1877) and was one of the first to introduce (1879) the study of experimental psychology into America; the Yale psychological laboratory being founded by him. In 1887, he published \"Elements of Physiological Psychology\", the first American textbook to include a substantial amount of information on the new experimental form of the discipline.\n\nHe married on December 8, 1869 at Bridgeport, Belmont County, Ohio, Cornelia Ann Tallman, born August 26, 1842 at St. Clairsville, Belmont County, Ohio and died on October 19, 1893 at North Haven, New Haven County, Connecticut. She was the daughter of Ellen Ryne and John C. Tallman, a well-known banker and business man of Bridgeport, Ohio.\n\nGeorge and Cornelia were the parents of four children:\n\nHe married second, on December 9, 1895, Frances Virginia Stevens, born February 9, 1866, at New York City, the daughter of Dr. George T. Stevens and Harriet Weeks Wadhams. There were no children from the second marriage.\n\nLadd died on August 8, 1921 at New Haven, Connecticut. After cremation, half his ashes were buried in \nSōji-ji, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, Japan and a monument was erected to him. The remaining ashes were interred under a monument of the rising sun in Grove Street Cemetery, New Haven, Ct.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The flexible nature of this seal allows pressure effects to cross the barrier but not the material being contained.\n\nCommon uses for diaphragm seals are to protect pressure sensors from the fluid whose pressure is being measured.\n\nSince diaphragm seals need to be highly flexible, elastomers are commonly used, and include a wide variety of both general purpose and speciality rubbers. Elastomers are limited to low pressure applications and those that are chemically compatible with the various plastics and rubbers used.\n\nMetal diaphragms of stainless steel (several grades), Carpenter 20, Hastelloy, Monel, Inconel, tantalum, titanium and several other metals are in common use where high pressure ratings and specific chemical compatibility are required. Flanged assemblies or flush welded versions are available.\n\nDepending on the PSI levels of the sealing application, the diaphragm may require fabric reinforcement. Typically, PSI under 5 does not require fabric reinforcement. A PSI between 5 and 10 is application dependent. Anything above 10 almost always needs fabric reinforcement.\n\nDiaphragm seals (also known as chemical seals or gauge guards) are also used to protect a process fluid from the pressure sensor. Examples of this use are:\n\n\nDiaphragm seals are susceptible to failure via several mechanisms, including cracking. Ozone cracking can occur in many elastomers for example used in pneumatic systems. If the gas contaminates the air supply, then many rubber diaphragms are at risk from the problem.\n\n"}
{"id": "2336332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2336332", "title": "Klarjeti", "text": "Klarjeti\n\nThe Klarjeti ( ; ) was a province of ancient and medieval Georgia, which is now part of the Turkey's Artvin Province. Klarjeti, the neighboring province of Tao and several other smaller districts constituted a larger region with shared history and culture conventionally known as Tao-Klarjeti.\n\nKlarjeti, traversed by the Chorokhi (Çoruh), stretched from the Arsiani Range westwards, towards the Black Sea, and was centred in the key fortified trading town of Artanuji (now Ardanuç). It was bordered by Shavsheti and Nigali on the north, and Tao on the south. The region roughly corresponds to Cholarzene () of Classical sources and probably to Kaţarza or Quturza of the earlier Urartian records.\n\nKlarjeti was one of the south-westernmost provinces of the Kingdom of Iberia, which appeared on the Caucasian political map in the 3rd century BC and was ruled—according to the medieval Georgian chronicles—by the Pharnavazid dynasty. From the 2nd century BC to the 3rd century AD, Klarjeti as well as some other neighboring lands were contested between the kingdoms of Iberia and Armenia (Armenians knew Klarjeti as Kļarjk'), and passed to and fro from one state to the other. In the 370s division of Iberia between the Roman and Sasanian empires, Klarjeti passed to the former, but it is unknown whether as a province or as a vassal. The marriage of the Chosroid king Vakhtang I of Iberia to the Roman princess Helena seems to have enabled the Iberians to regain the province c. 485. Thereafter, Klarjeti remained in the possession of Vakhtang's younger sons and their romanophile descendants who formed the house of Guaramids and maintained themselves in Klarjeti and Javakheti until c. 786, when the Guaramid possessions passed to their resurgent cousins from the Bagrationi family.\n\nThe Bagrationi dynasty presided over a period of economic prosperity and cultural revival in the area. The taxes collected at Artanuji were a major factor in the rise of the Bagrationi power. Deserted in an Arab invasion, Klarjeti was repopulated and developed into a major centre of Christian culture aided by a large-scale monastic movement initiated by the Georgian monk Gregory of Khandzta (759 – 861).\n\nAround 870, Klarjeti became a hereditary fiefdom of one of the three principal branches of the Georgian Bagrationi rulers. This line—known in the medieval Georgian records as the Sovereigns of Klarjeti (კლარჯნი ხელმწიფენი, \"klarjni khelmts'ip'eni\")—was eventually dispossessed by their cousin Bagrat III, the first king of a unified Georgia, in 1010. Bagrat III granted area to the Abuserisdze family.\n\nKlarjeti never fully recovered from a series of Seljuk attacks later in the 11th century and further declined in the Mongol and Timur's invasions in the 13th and 14th century. After the partition of the Kingdom of Georgia in the 15th century, Klarjeti passed to the princes of Meskheti who lost the area to the Ottoman conquest in 1551.\n"}

It was never mounted. The other missions were \"Operation Condor\", \"Operation Concertina\" and \"Operation Coverlet\".\n\nBetween 1940 and 1945, the Channel Islands were the only British territory to come under Nazi occupation. On these islands were entrenched almost 40,000 German soldiers, sailors and airmen, behind fortifications that had consumed more than 10% of the concrete used in the Atlantic Wall which stretched from Norway to the Pyrenees.\n\nIn 1943, British Chief of Combined Operations, Vice-Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten proposed \"Operation Constellation\", an offensive against the Channel Islands, \"Operation Concertina\", an offensive against Alderney, \"Operation Coverlet\", the offensive against Guernsey, and \"Operation Condor\", the offensive against Jersey. He suggested that:\n\nIn 1941, the Channel Islands, captured without opposition in July 1940 were turned into fortresses, never to be surrendered. These developments had been observed by Mountbatten through aerial reconnaissance. Mountbatten commented:\n\n\"Prior action\" meant either naval bombardment or aerial bombing. Although most defences were on or near the coast, the inaccuracies of bombing or shelling had the potential to pulverise two thirds of Guernsey's land surface, and at least half of Jersey's. Because of the likely substantial civilian casualties from this bombardment, the extreme difficulty and likely casualties of invasion even after heavy bombardment, and the very limited use of the islands for the Allies, the operations were shelved. \n\nThe German garrison of the islands was by-passed with Operation Overlord, the liberation of mainland Europe, and eventually surrendered as part of the general German surrender on 9 May 1945, a day later than the rest of Europe and in the case of Alderney, on 16 May 1945.\n\n\nTabb, Peter \"A Peculiar Occupation, New Perspectives on Hitler's Channel Islands\" (May 2005)\n"}

The engine was an air-cooled, two-stroke, two-cylinder unit originally displacing 250 cc, but later available in increased sizes of 300 cc and 400 cc. It had an electric pre-selective transmission built by Getrag and a manual clutch. The engine was behind the rear wheels. Suspension was independent all round using coil springs with swing axles.\n\n214,313 sedans, 66,511 coupés, and 3,667 Transporter vans and pickups were built from 1955 to 1969.\n\nThe Goggomobil T250 was introduced by Glas at the 1954 IFMA international bicycle and motorcycle show. The T250 was a conventional-looking two door sedan with a rear-mounted 245 cc air-cooled two-stroke straight twin engine.\n\nDesign changes were made to the T250 in 1957. Two windshield wipers were used instead of the earlier single wiper, and the sliding windows in the doors were changed to wind-up windows. Also at this time the T300 and T400 became available; these had larger engines of 300 cc and 400 cc capacity respectively.\n\nThe last design change for the T sedan came in 1964, when the rear-hinged suicide doors were replaced by conventional front-hinged doors.\n\n214,313 sedans had been built before production ended on 30 June 1969.\n\nThe Goggomobil TS 2+2 coupe was introduced at the 1957 IFMA show alongside the improved T sedan. It was available as the TS250, the TS300, and the TS400, the number reflecting the approximate engine size in cubic centimeters.\n\nThe only major design change to the TS coupe was the change from rear-hinged suicide doors to front-hinged conventional doors in 1964.\n\nThe TS coupe was always ten to twenty percent more expensive than the T sedan. Total production of TS coupes was 66,511.\n\nThe specifications of a 1957 Goggomobil TS 300 Coupe are:\n\nA TS300 coupé tested by the British magazine \"The Motor\" in 1957 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0 to in 27.9 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £625 including taxes of £209 on the UK market.\nThe specifications of a 1958 Goggomobil TS 250 Coupe are: \n\nThe Goggomobil Transporter, or Goggomobil TL, was introduced at the 1956 IFMA show. The Transporter was built largely at the request of the German Federal Postal Service, which procured more than 2,000 Transporters between October 1957 and November 1965.\n\nThe Transporter had sliding front doors. It was available as an enclosed van with double back doors or as a pickup with a tailgate to the open bed. Transporter pickups were often used by municipal services as snow plows or street sweepers.\n\n3,667 Transporter vans and pickups were produced.\nGoggomobils were exported to the United States. These were special export versions, with the 400 cc engine, an automatic gasoline-oil mixer, and sealed-beam headlights as required by US regulations.\n\nBetween 1957 and 1961 some 700 sports cars called Goggomobil Darts were produced by Buckle Motors Pty Ltd in Sydney, Australia. Other Goggomobil models were also produced under licence, including saloon, coupe, coupe-convertible and light van variants. These were fitted with Australian produced fibreglass bodies in place of the steel bodies of their German counterparts. Australian production totalled approximately 5,000 units. In 2019 an Australian documentary featuring the Dart Car was released called \"D'art\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2336347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2336347", "title": "Rosetta Stone (software)", "text": "Rosetta Stone (software)\n\nRosetta Stone Language Learning is proprietary computer-assisted language learning (CALL) software published by Rosetta Stone Inc. The software uses images, text, and sound to teach words and grammar by spaced repetition, without translation. Rosetta Stone calls its approach Dynamic Immersion™.\n\nThe software's name and logo allude to the an ancient stone slab of the same name on which the Decree of Memphis is inscribed in three writing systems.\n\nIn a Rosetta Stone Language Learning exercise, the student pairs sound or text to one of several images. The number of images per screen varies.\n\nFor example, the software shows the student four photographs. A native speaker makes a statement that describes one of the photographs, and the statement is printed on the screen; the student chooses the photograph that the speaker described. In another variation, the student completes a textual description of a photograph.\n\nIn writing exercises, the software provides an on-screen keyboard for the user to type characters that are not in the Latin alphabet.\n\nGrammar lessons cover grammatical tense and grammatical mood. In grammar lessons, the program firstly shows the learner several examples of a grammatical concept, and in some levels the word or words the learner should focus on are highlighted. Then the learner is given a sentence with several options for a word or phrase, and the student chooses the correct option.\n\nIf the student has a microphone, the software can attempt to evaluate word pronunciation.\n\nEach lesson concludes with a review of the content in that lesson, and each unit concludes with a milestone, which is a simulated conversation that includes the content of the unit.\n\nThe program immediately informs whether the answer is right or wrong. Through the Preferences screen, the student can choose whether a sound is played or not when an answer is clicked. At the bottom of the window, the program shows all the screens for the current lesson. If all answers for that screen are correct, the button for that screen turns green. If some answers are correct, the border of the button turns green, but the screen number itself turns orange. If all answers for a screen are wrong, the button turns orange. This applies to all lessons except review and milestone lessons, which are treated as tests. In those lessons, the buttons for each screen all remain brown. In all lessons there is a button in the bottom-right of the window which can be hovered over to display how many answers are correct, wrong or have not been answered. Each time an answer is clicked, one point is given. At the end of the lesson, the total number of correct, wrong or skipped answers is shown alongside the percentage of correct answers for that lesson. If too many questions were answered incorrectly, the program suggests the learner should retry the lesson.\n\nTo use Rosetta Stone Language Learning, a student needs the Rosetta Stone application software and at least one level of a language pack. The latest major version of Rosetta Stone is Rosetta Stone Language Learning 5.0.13.\n\nLanguage packs also have version numbers. The version number of the language pack is distinct from the version numbering scheme of the Rosetta Stone application, and a language pack is only compatible with specific versions of the application. Version 4 and 5 are backward compatible with language packs developed for Version 3, but not older ones.\n\nBy the end of 1996, Rosetta Stone Version 1 had a selection of nine level-one language courses (Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Mandarin Chinese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish) and four level-two courses (English, French, German, Spanish). A CD-ROM product called The Rosetta Stone PowerPac featured introductory versions of seven of the courses.\n\nAt this time, Fairfield Language Technologies had already begun development of the Arabic, Esperanto, Hebrew, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Swahili, Thai, and Vietnamese courses. Within a few months, the Japanese, Thai, and Vietnamese courses were complete, and development of Latin, Polish, and Welsh courses were underway. The Latin course was the next to be completed, followed by Hebrew. In this fashion, Fairfield introduced new courses to market gradually.\n\nRosetta Stone Version 1 was developed for Macintosh System 6 and higher, and Windows 3.0 and higher. Later revisions of Version 1 for Macintosh required System 7. The final revision of Version 1 was v1.9.\n\nAt Version 2, Fairfield continued to add more language courses, but also marketed more editions of The Rosetta Stone software.\n\nThe PowerPac CD-ROM introduced in Version 1 now featured basic lessons in seven languages. One complete level of a language course was now called a Personal Edition of the software.\n\nBecause many consumers found The Rosetta Stone to be too expensive, Fairfield started a series of \"Explorer\" editions. An Explorer CD-ROM was a lower-cost excerpt of a Version 2 course. Each edition of the Rosetta Stone Explorer series (Japanese Explorer, Welsh Explorer, etc.) included three units (22 lessons) from Level 1. The company no longer sells Explorer editions.\n\nThen there was Global Traveler, a CD-ROM and electronic translation dictionary package for people requiring some facility in English, French, Spanish, Italian, or German. The lessons on the CD-ROM teach words and phrases for travelers. The electronic translator was programmed with about 60,000 words and 720 phrases.\n\nThe Rosetta Stone v2.0.x is backward compatible with some of the later language packs for Version 1; specifically languages courses with a version number of 3.0 or 4.0.x.\n\nThe Rosetta Stone v2.1 through v2.2.x are only compatible with v6.x language courses. These versions of the language packs and software engine are neither backward compatible nor forward compatible. Language discs developed for The Rosetta Stone v2.0.x are incompatible with these later revisions of the software.\n\nIn v2.1.4.1A of The Rosetta Stone, the program began using copy protection software called SafeDisc.\n\nRosetta Stone Version 3 is not backward compatible with language packs developed for Rosetta Stone Versions 1 or 2.\n\nVersion 3 was initially released in August 2007 for ten bestselling languages, with other languages following later on. The final revision of Version 3 is v3.4.7.r1.\n\nHomeschool Edition introduces additional features that keep track of time spent per lesson, scores achieved on lessons, lesson plans, and instructional objectives. This edition includes a supplemental CD-ROM that has workbooks, quizzes, lesson transcripts, and exams.\n\nUnlike the Personal Edition, the Homeschool Edition application does not recommend reviews. Aside from the minor differences, the homeschool edition is essentially the same as the personal edition—except for the supplemental CD with written exercises and lesson plans. The language discs in the two editions are identical and are interchangeable. Some may have 3 discs and some may have 5. Much of the information on the supplemental CD-ROM is available online from Rosetta Stone.\n\nVersion 4 is backward compatible with all language packs developed for Version 3.\n\nRosetta Stone released Version 4 TOTALe on September 14, 2010. TOTALe is a software suite comprising Rosetta Course, Rosetta Studio, Rosetta World, and TOTALe Mobile Companion. Users of the Rosetta Studio software subscribe to a service that videoconferences them with a language coach. Rosetta World is a social gaming service. TOTALe Mobile Companion is a Rosetta Stone mobile app for iOS and Android devices.\n\nWith Version 4, Rosetta Stone adds stricter copy protection measures.\n\nRosetta Stone released Version 5 on October 9, 2014. The notable changes are the change in brand name (\"Rosetta Course\" has become \"Language Training\"), a new interactive demo is built into the application based on user feedback and a new minimalist UI with no beveled edges or drop shadows.\n\nThe software is offered in three variants\n\n\n\n\nRosetta Stone’s Discover Languages is an app currently only available on Xbox One. It is very different from the traditional design, involving a virtual world and more of a focus on games in order to appeal more strongly to game playing audiences. The only languages currently supported are English and Spanish.\n\n, there are 28 Language Training courses offered by Rosetta. Each language course requires either its own language pack, offered through CD-ROMs or downloads, or online subscription.\n\n\n\nThe language courses are divided into three to five levels offered as language packs either in CD-ROMs or Download. In the retail software packages of Rosetta Stone, each CD-ROM has one level.\n\nAll languages, except Latin, use mostly the same set of words and sentences in almost the same order, with mainly the same images. Some of the material is reused from lesson to lesson to invoke long-term retention.\n\nIn version 3 pack, there are four units per language level. Each unit has four core lessons that are about 30 minutes long. The student then moves on to one of the following lesson modes: Pronunciation, Writing, Vocabulary, Grammar, Listening, Reading, Speaking. The Milestone is an exercise at the end of each unit in which students apply what they learned in the unit.\n\nIn Rosetta Stone version 2 Language Packs, most lessons have two levels; a few have three.\n\nThe first eight units have 84 lessons, plus eight reviews. The lessons reiterate simple vocabulary and grammatical tenses. The lessons conclude with a unit on giving directions.\n\nUnits 1–4 have 10 lessons and one review. Units 5–8 have 11 lessons and a review.\n\nThe 11 units of Level 2 include a total of 118 lessons. The lessons in the first nine units have a format similar to those in Level 1. The final two units are \"Glossary\" units devoted to single words pertaining to a particular topic, such as school, nature, or automobiles.\n\nLevel 2 units cover more advanced grammar, as well as preparation for common situations, such as banking, shopping, and tourism. Short videos (in QuickTime format) illustrate some verbs.\n\nUnits 16 and 17 use single-panel comics from the \"Saturday Evening Post\" as a teaching tool.\n\nLevel 3 expands on Level 2 with longer videos and written passages.\n\nRosetta Stone version 3 Language Pack has 3–5 levels. The lessons differ by language. Compared with Version 2, Version 3 lessons focus more on conversation and less on grammar rules.\n\nIn level one, each unit has a 30-minute lesson and some activities that are five to fifteen minutes long. Level 1 takes up to 24 hours to complete.\n\nStarting from simple vocabulary such as basic greetings, \"boy\", \"girl\", \"man\", and \"woman\", moving up through numbers, comparisons, adjectives, nouns, verb conjugation, and telling time. Each unit also contains a ten-minute simulated conversation called a \"Milestone\".\n\nThe units are: Language Basics, Greetings and Introductions, Work and School, and Shopping.\n\nLevel 2 offers a total of about twenty-four hours designed to teach the user to \"navigate your surroundings as you build on the vocabulary and essential language structure in Level 1.\" More grammar is covered, including past and future tenses, and imperative forms. Topics such as giving directions, writing letters, workplace terms, apologies, discussing emotions, and criticizing art are also covered. As in Level 1, each unit is followed by a ten-minute \"Milestone\".\n\nThe four units in Level 2 are Travel, Past and Future, Friends and Social Life, and Dining and Vacation.\n\nLevel 3 offers instruction designed to help \"connect with the world around you by building on the language fundamentals and conversational skills you developed in Levels 1 and 2.\" In addition to expanding upon grammar learned in Levels 1 and 2, Level 3 teaches more in depth vocabulary, including botanical terms, culinary terms, how to express detailed opinions and judgments, and how to discuss politics, religion, and business. As in the first two levels, each unit contains a ten-minute \"Milestone\" activity in which the user participates in a simulated conversation.\n\nThe four units in Level 3 are Home and Health, Life and World, Everyday Things, and Places and Events.\n\nThe four units are Tourism and Recreation, Professions and Hobbies, At Home and Around Town, and Style and Personal Wellness.\n\nThe five units are Business and Industry, Arts and Academics, Emergency Situations, and Family and Community.\n\nLevels 4 and 5 teach more complex sentence structures, higher verbal tenses, and more irregular verbs, and introduce more vocabulary.\n\nOn 9 June 2008, Rosetta Stone introduced an addition to its Version 3 product line: Audio Companion, supplemental audio recordings of words and phrases. The student is meant to repeat the spoken words and phrases for practice and memorization. Unlike recordings based on the Pimsleur method, the Audio Companion provides neither narration nor translations. Rosetta Stone distributes the audio supplements on audio CD and as MP3 files. Each Audio Companion supplements one level of the language course, and each disc supplements a specific unit. Complete Version 4 course packages include Audio Companion material for each level.\n\nThe Endangered Language Program was created in 2004 for use by endangered language communities engaged in language revitalization.\n\nOrganizations that contract the Endangered Language Program to develop custom software own the sales and distribution rights over their final product, allowing communities control over this language resource and respecting indigenous intellectual property rights. These versions are thus not marketed via the usual outlets such as bookstores or commercial websites.\n\nBased in Harrisonburg, Virginia, the Endangered Language Program began offering a corporate grant program in 2007 to underwrite development costs for awarded communities. Rosetta Stone Inc. offered the first awards of the grant program to the Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana and the Navajo Language Renaissance coalition.\n\nThe Endangered Language Program also offers paid internships to graduate and undergraduate students interested in contributing to the work of the program.\n\nIn November 2015 the Chickasaw Nation, through the Chickasaw Language Revitalization Program established in 2007, contracted with Rosetta Stone to customize language learning content to preserve and introduce the Chickasaw language to its 60,000+ members worldwide. This effort comes as the Chickasaw Nation has approximately 50 native speakers remaining, with its last monolingual speaker having died in 2013.\n\nFrequent criticism of the program arises in its lack of sensitivity to the differences between the various languages it comes in and their respective cultures. Early versions of the software presented the same concepts in the same order, using the same images taken mostly in the Washington, D.C. area near the company's headquarters at the time in Harrisonburg, Virginia. In the most recent version, there have been some modifications to the picture set for certain languages or regions.\n\nAnother frequent issue was the use of more formal vocabulary than that regularly used by native speakers. In 2006, \"Macworld\" reviewer Cyrus Farivar noted that his Persian CD used \"khodrow\" for \"car\", although most native speakers use a French loanword, \"ma:sheen\". The same course did not teach words that would be important to someone learning Persian, such as \"bread\" and \"tea\"; however, it very curiously included the word \"elephant\" in a basic vocabulary lesson. Perplexed by the question of why the word \"elephant\" would be taught in a language where it might never be used (there are not many elephants in Iran), Farivar called Rosetta Stone, Inc. He was told that the company makes four different picture sets: one for Western languages, another for Asian languages, and two sets unique to each Swahili and Latin. The Persian language CD was using the Western picture set, which explains why the images were not culturally relevant.\n\nWriting in 1997, Donald McRae of Brock University said that Rosetta Stone represented \"good pedagogy\" and that \"the authors of the program never lose sight of solid teaching methodology\". He described the Version 2 German language course as \"very good\", but indicated that he had \"some reservations\".\n\nIn a 1997 review of the Version 2 Russian language course, Mark Kaiser, director of the Language Media Center at the University of California, Berkeley, called the program \"woefully inadequate for a number of reasons\".\n\nOne of Kaiser's observations was that Rosetta Stone software fails to provide a relevant cultural context. Because the company uses the same stock photographs for all its language courses, they depict people, activities, and manufactured goods that are conspicuously American. Kaiser also found that Rosetta Stone Version 2 does not provide a way for students to evaluate their conversation skills, and that some of the words and phrases are too English-based.\n\n\"The entire package lacks any pedagogical foundation,\" he concluded. \"Rather, it utilizes the glitz of the multimedia capabilities of the computer, a dearth of quality foreign language software, and clever marketing to create an economically successful product.\"\n\nThe language-learning specialist Stephen Krashen found that the few studies on the software produced learning results that were \"about as effective as traditional instruction on traditional tests.\"\n\nThe user purchases a licence to use the software, which is non-transferable. Up to five members of a household may use a single licence.\n\n\n\n\nIn December 2007, the United States Army offered a special military version of Arabic to help troops deploying to the Middle East learn the language for conversations and phrases important in a military situation. It was available to all US Army personnel, US Military Academy cadets, contracted US Army ROTC Cadets and other special guests with a sponsor.\n\nThe United States Army \"E-Learning\", a SkillPort product, offered the full Version 3 Online, with the exception of only a few languages. The Army E-Learning web site was accessible by most Army members with a valid AKO (Army Knowledge Online) e-mail address or CAC (Common Access Card).\n\nRosetta Stone's Army contract ended on September 24, 2011.\n\nOther branches of the U.S military also offered Rosetta Stone software. The United States Air Force also offers a similar version to company-grade officers. The United States Marine Corps also offers an online version of all the languages that Rosetta Stone offers through their MarineNet Distance Learning portal.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State uses Rosetta Stone (Version 3 as of 2009) as a companion to their in-class and distance learning language programs provided through the Foreign Service Institute. It is free for civil and foreign service employees.\n\nIn April 2011, James Madison University was the first university to partner with Rosetta Stone to offer the Rosetta Stone Version 4 TOTALe as an accredited Conversational Spanish I language learning course. The program teaches Spanish through a series of images that, when clicked on, show the vocabulary word. The student will speak into a microphone and speech recognition software will correct mispronounced words, according to Reilly Brennan, Rosetta Stone's Director of Public Relations. The course is available to adults who want to complete a degree for teaching and non-degree seeking students are eligible to take the class. The Rosetta Stone TOTALe accredited offering is a 16-week, intensive language-learning program. The program is accessed completely online and follows a syllabus approved by Rosetta Stone and James Madison University.\n\n"}
{"id": "2336349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2336349", "title": "Philadelphia, Here I Come!", "text": "Philadelphia, Here I Come!\n\nPhiladelphia, Here I Come! is a 1964 play by Irish dramatist Brian Friel. Set in the fictional town of Ballybeg, County Donegal, the play launched Friel onto the international stage.\n\n\"Philadelphia, Here I Come!\" centres around Gareth (Gar) O'Donnell's move to America, specifically Philadelphia. The play takes place on the night before and morning of Gar's departure to America. Gar is portrayed by two characters, Gar Public (\"the Gar that people see, talk to, talk about\") and Gar Private (\"the unseen man, the man within, the conscience\"). Gareth lives with his father, S. B. O'Donnell (\"a responsible, respectable citizen\") with whom he has never connected. Gar works for his father in his shop and their relationship is no different from that of Boss and Employee. Private often makes fun of S.B. calling him \"Screwballs\" and parodying his nightly routine as a fashion show.\n\nEssentially, this play is a tragicomedy. It contains many comical scenes, especially the scene with Lizzy Sweeney, Gar's aunt, in which Gar decides to go to America. Despite the fact that Gar seems to have a relationship with his father no different from that of Boss and Employee, there are indications that there is love between them. In episode 1, Madge says \"It must have been near daybreak when he (SB O'Donnell) got to sleep last night. I could hear the bed creaking.\" Other indications that SB is secretly devastated by his son's imminent departure, include his remembrance of Gar in a sailor suit proudly declaring he need not go to school, he'll work in his fathers shop – a memory of an event that may not have happened, and the scene when he pretends to read the paper, but fails to notice that it has been upside-down.\n\nGar's reasons for going to America (he wanted to prove to Aunt Lizzie that he was not \"cold like the O'Donnells\"), along with his secret love for his uncommunicative father, and their desperate final, pathetic attempts to communicate make this play quite tragic.\n\nAll of the action in this play takes place within a period of a few hours on the evening of Gar's departure, but it also includes flashbacks to Gar's relationship with local girl Kate Doogan, and the visit from his Aunt Lizzie.\n\nThe play was first staged at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin on September 28, 1964. The production, directed by Hilton Edwards, transferred to Broadway in 1966, where it ran for 326 performances, and received several Tony Award nominations, including for Best Play and Best Director.\n\nIn 2004, the play was performed through the Association of Regional Theatres Northern Ireland, directed by Adrian Dunbar and produced by Andrea Montgomery.\n\nSecond Age Theatre Company staged the play in 2007, directed by Alan Stanford. This production toured Ireland, stopping off at Donegal, Ennis, Dublin and Cork, as well as New York, Texas and California in the USA.\n\nIn 2012 the play was staged at Donmar Warehouse Theatre in London.\n\nNoel Pearson produced an acclaimed revival of the play at Dublin's Gaiety Theatre in March/April 2010.\n\nAndrew Flynn directed the play at Lyric Theatre, Belfast in February/March 2014.\n\nAn amateur production of the play will be staged by the Irish Theatre Group at the Warehouse Studio Theatre in Brussels, Belgium, 26-30 March 2019.\n\nThe play, like Friel's \"Dancing at Lughnasa\", is on the syllabus for English Higher Level and Ordinary Level for the Irish Leaving Certificate examinations, as well as the English A1 course of the International Baccalaureate.\n\nIn November 2010 Second Age presented \"Dancing at Lughnasa\" at the Helix Theatre, Dublin City University.\n\nBelow is a list of the characters from the play \"Philadelphia, Here I Come!\" along with a cast list from when it was first performed, at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, on September 28, 1964.\n\n\nThe play was adapted for a film released in Ireland in 1970. The adaptation was produced and directed by John Quested and stars Siobhán McKenna, Donal McCann, and Des Cave. Although it was apparently never released to theaters in the US, it is part of the American Film Theatre series of films, and was released to DVD in 2003 along with the other thirteen films.\n\n"}

It is located in Camden, New Jersey. Founded in 1766, Rutgers–Camden began as an amalgam of the South Jersey Law School and the College of South Jersey. It is the southernmost of the three regional campuses of Rutgers—the others being located in New Brunswick and Newark.\n\nRutgers University–Camden began as the South Jersey Law School and the College of South Jersey. The schools were founded by a group of citizens led by Collingswood mayor and lawyer Arthur E. Armitage in 1929. In 1950, the two schools became the Camden campus when they merged with Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey. After decades of providing students with a comprehensive liberal arts curriculum, in 1981 Rutgers–Camden began to offer its first master's degree programs, in biology, English, and business administration. In 1989, the growing demand for business offerings led to the founding of the School of Business–Camden, the first business school in southern New Jersey to earn prestigious accreditation from the AACSB International. Rutgers–Camden achieved another academic first in 2007: launching the first of its kind PhD program in childhood studies. Today, Rutgers–Camden boasts two additional PhD degrees in integrative biology and public affairs. The business school offers a four-year undergraduate business curriculum along with MBA, professional master’s, and executive programs. The law school, ranked highly and nationally, boasts a new and impressive facility complete with a state-of-the-art moot courtroom. In 2011, the School of Nursing became the newest academic unit at Rutgers–Camden, providing health care institutions throughout the region with high-caliber nursing professionals.\n\nIn 2002, Rutgers University–Camden and the University of Havana signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to formalize research and exchange opportunities for students and faculty. It was renewed in 2016.\n\nIn July 2012, the New Jersey Legislature passed the \"New Jersey Medical and Health Sciences Higher Education Restructuring Act,\" integrating Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, with units of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ). The Restructuring Act created a Rutgers–Camden Board of Directors that has the authority to determine policies for the organization, administration and development of the campus. It also links Rutgers–Camden with Rowan University for joint science collaborations. In July 2014, the legacy University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey School of Nursing at Stratford merged with the Rutgers School of Nursing–Camden.\n\nRutgers–Camden is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. It has nearly 40 majors and 50 minors plus special programs, an Honors College, hands-on research with faculty mentors, study abroad, internships, civic learning, and various graduate and advanced professional programs. The academic year follows a 4-4 schedule of two four-course semesters, fall and spring. During the winter study term, students study various courses outside of typical curriculum for 3 weeks in January. Rutgers students often take the winter study term to pursue internships or work on intensive research projects.\n\nThe College of Arts and Sciences is the largest academic unit at Rutgers–Camden. Students enjoy the advantages of a personalized liberal arts education as well as the benefits of studying at a campus of a research university, particularly the opportunity to work closely with distinguished faculty. Students have a broad choice of majors and programs in the humanities, the arts, the social sciences, and the natural and physical sciences, including those in traditional liberal arts fields as well as more professionally oriented courses of study. The College of Arts and Sciences also has a highly selective Honors College, which offers a challenging academic program that includes seminars, junior and senior year projects, and extracurricular activities.\n\nThe Graduate School offers 14 programs granting master's degrees in several liberal arts disciplines including history, English literature, languages, and creative writing, as well as advanced degrees in the biological, chemical, computer, and mathematical sciences, nursing, psychology, social work, political science and public policy, and Doctoral programs in Childhood Studies, Computational Biology, and Public Affairs with emphasis on community development. An MBA program is offered through the Rutgers School of Business-Camden.\n\nThe Rutgers–Camden Center for the Arts provides performances, exhibitions, education programs, and community projects. The Fine Arts Building on the Rutgers–Camden campus houses the Walter K. Gordon Theater, Black Box Theater, and the Stedman Gallery. The Gordon Theater is the home venue for the Collingswood-based Symphony in C.\n\nThe Rutgers School of Business is accredited by The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).\n\nThe Rutgers Law School is a center of legal education, with two campuses—in Camden and Newark. Its faculty is internationally recognized in a number of fields including constitutional, criminal, health, and corporate law. Its alumni are leading members of the bar in public and private practice settings throughout the nation. The school is well represented among the state and federal judiciary. The law school is a member of the Association of American Law Schools and is on the list of approved schools of the American Bar Association. It offers a three-year course of study for full-time students and a four-year, part-time program leading to the awarding of the Juris Doctor degree.\"\nThe Rutgers School of Nursing–Camden offers curricula that integrate nursing knowledge and clinical practice, including baccalaureate programs for traditional students, registered nurse students, and second-degree students; a doctor of nursing practice program; and certification in school nursing and wound ostomy continence nursing.\n\nPaul Robeson Library Located in the heart of the Rutgers–Camden Campus, the Paul Robeson Library develops and maintains access to materials that support undergraduate and graduate coursework and research. A designated Federal Depository for the First U.S. Congressional District, the library serves as a public resource for the citizens of New Jersey. Library faculty deliver comprehensive support for reference and research questions in their subject areas. Through the Paul Robeson Library, the Rutgers–Camden community may access the global resources of the Rutgers University Library System. Recent renovations to the library include an upgraded student computing center and a new lounge area for study. The Robeson library also serves as the academic library for students and faculty at the Camden campuses of Camden County College and Rowan University.\n\nLaw Library One of New Jersey’s largest law libraries serves as a research facility for law students, legal practitioners, and the general public. The Law Library houses a collection of over 440,000 books and other materials, and the collection is comprehensive in its holdings of American, English, Canadian, and foreign legal periodicals. The Law Library is located on three floors of the Law School Building. A selective federal depository, the Rutgers–Camden Law Library hosts numerous online collections of public documents related to federal and New Jersey courts.\n\nUndergraduate and graduate dorms are located at Third and Cooper Streets, and a graduate residence hall is located at 330 Cooper Street.

The Writers House hosts writers, scholars, and others for various programs.\n\nNorth of the campus green, The Rutgers-Camden Center for the Arts houses the Stedman Art Gallery, the Gordon Theater, and the Black Box theater.\n\nRegional rail access to the university is provided by the PATCO's City Hall station, located two blocks from center campus, and the RiverLINE's Cooper Street - Rutgers University station. The Walter Rand Transportation Center is located a few blocks from campus, which provides access to several NJTransit bus lines. Additionally, the seasonally operated RiverLink Ferry running between Camden and Philadelphia has a stop at the nearby Adventure Aquarium.\n\nAs a service to students of the university, the Rutgers–Camden Police Department provides \"a walking security escort for individuals to their vehicles; campus housing; the PATCO Hi-Speed Line station at Fifth and Market St.; and the Walter Rand Transportation Center on Broadway\". The campus also runs shuttle buses with stops throughout the campus.\n\nKnown as the Scarlet Raptors, Rutgers–Camden's athletic teams are a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)—in Division III—and the New Jersey Athletic Conference. They compete in 9 men's sports and 10 women's sports:\n\nIn 2006, Rutgers–Camden earned its first NCAA Division III national championship when the softball team defeated top-ranked and two-time defending champion St. Thomas (MN), 3-2. Rutgers–Camden set program marks with a 47-5 record and a 29-game winning streak.\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, Rutgers–Camden student-athlete Tim VanLiew won back-to-back NCAA Men's Division III Outdoor Track and Field Championships in the javelin. He won his first title on May 26, 2012, with a throw of at Claremont-Mudd-Scripps in Claremont, California. Nearly a year to the day of his first title, he not only defended his national javelin title, but he did so in record-breaking fashion. VanLiew’s throw of set the all-time NCAA Division III record for the new javelin, while shattering the NCAA Championship record, the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse stadium mark, and VanLiew’s old Rutgers–Camden program record in the process.\n\nRutgers–Camden's men's soccer team went a school-record 37 consecutive games without a loss, a record that spanned the 2012 and 2013 seasons. The team compiled a 32-0-5 record during that time, the eighth-longest streak in NCAA Division III men's soccer history. The team earned a trip to the NCAA Division III National Championship for the first time in program history by defeating Loras College, 3-2, in overtime on Dec. 6, 2013, in San Antonio, Texas.

He graduated from the Leningrad Choreographic School in 1946 and danced as a soloist of the Kirov Ballet until 1962. His staging of Sergey Prokofiev's \"The Stone Flower\" (1957) and of \"The Legend of Love\" (1961) brought him acclaim as a choreographer. In 1964 he moved to the Bolshoi Theatre, where he would work as an artistic director until 1995. His most famous productions at the Bolshoi were \"The Nutcracker\" (1966), \"Spartacus\" (1967), and \"Ivan the Terrible\" (1975). He controversially reworked \"Swan Lake\" to produce a happy end for the story in 1984. In 1995, he was accused of having allowed the theatre to plunge into stagnation and after many a squabble was ousted from office. Thereupon he choreographed for various Russian companies before settling in Krasnodar, where he set up his own company. Grigorovich has been heading the juries of numerous international competitions in classical ballet. After the death of his wife, the great ballerina Natalia Bessmertnova, on 19 February 2008, he was offered the opportunity to return to the Bolshoi again in the capacity of ballet master and choreographer.\n\n\n[[Category:Pied piper award\n[[Category:People's Artists of the USSR]]\n[[Category:Honorary Members of the Russian Academy of Arts]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Lenin]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the USSR State Prize]]\n[[Category:Heroes of Socialist Labour]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Francysk Skaryna]]\n[[Category:1927 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Prix Benois de la Danse jurors]]\n[[Category:Soviet male ballet dancers]]"}

He is credited by Louisiana music scholars with laying the groundwork for Creole music in the early 20th century, and wrote several songs now regarded as zydeco standards.\n\nArdoin was born near Basile in Evangeline Parish, Louisiana a descendant of both free and captive people. Amadee spoke only French and did not speak English, as did most people in this French speaking region. Developing his musical talents in preference to undertaking farm work, he played at dances, often for Cajun audiences, with fiddle players Alphonse LaFleur and Douglas Bellard. He moved around the area frequently, settling at one point near Chataignier where he met Cajun fiddle player Dennis McGee. They established a more regular musical partnership, playing at local house parties, sometimes attended by Ardoin's young cousin, Alphonse \"Bois Sec\" Ardoin.\n\nArdoin and McGee were among the first artists to record the music of the Acadiana region of Louisiana. On December 9, 1929, they recorded six songs for Columbia Records in New Orleans. They made further recordings together in New Orleans in 1930, and in San Antonio, Texas in August 1934. Ardoin also made solo recordings in New York City in December 1934. The recordings were issued on various labels, including Brunswick, Vocalion, Decca, Melotone and Bluebird. In all, thirty-four recordings with Ardoin playing accordion are known to exist.\n\nHis recordings and performances became popular throughout southern Louisiana. In the late 1930s, he played regularly in Eunice, Louisiana with fiddle player Sady Courville, but the two did not record together. Ardoin's music combined \"European song forms and African rhythmic approaches such as swing and syncopation... [He] personified this cultural blend and enhanced its development through his deft technique and his ability to improvise. Ardoin was a lively, inventive accordionist who could keep a crowd dancing while playing alone. He was also a soulful singer whose emotional style made dramatic use of elongated, high-pitched notes.\"\n\nThe circumstances that led to Ardoin's death, and the final cause of his death, are uncertain. Descendants of family members and musicians who knew Ardoin tell a story, now well-known, about a racially motivated attack on him in which he was severely beaten, in about 1939, while walking home after playing at a house dance near Eunice. The most common story says that some white men were angered when a white woman, daughter of the house, lent her handkerchief to Ardoin to wipe the sweat from his face. According to Canray Fontenot and Wade Fruge, in PBS's \"American Patchwork\", Ardoin left the place and was run over by a Model A car which crushed his head and throat, damaging his vocal cords. He was found the next day, lying in a ditch. According to Fontenot, he \"went plumb crazy\" and \"didn't know if he was hungry or not. Others had to feed him. He got weaker and weaker until he died.\" Others consider this story apocryphal. Other versions say that Ardoin was poisoned, not beaten, possibly by a jealous fellow musician.\n\nContemporaries said that Ardoin suffered from impaired mental and musical capacities later in his life. Some recent studies have concluded that he died as a result of a venereal disease. He ended up in an asylum in Pineville, Louisiana, where he was admitted in September 1942. He died at the hospital two months later, and was buried in the hospital's common grave.\n\nOn March 11, 2018, a life-sized statue of Ardoin was unveiled at the St. Landry Parish Visitor Center. The project was headed by Louisiana's former Poet Laureate, author, and professor Darrell Bourque, who wrote a book of poetry titled 'If You Abandon Me: An Amédé Ardoin Songbook', the cover of which features artwork by Pierre Bourque.\n\n\n\n"}

In the late 1890s, while he was still only in his twenties, Perosi was an internationally celebrated composer of sacred music, especially large-scale oratorios. Nobel Prize winner Romain Rolland wrote, \"It's not easy to give you an exact idea of how popular Lorenzo Perosi is in his native country.\" Perosi's fame was not restricted to Europe. A 19 March 1899 \"New York Times\" article entitled \"The Genius of Don Perosi\" began, \"The great and ever-increasing success which has greeted the four new oratorios of Don Lorenzo Perosi has placed this young priest-composer on a pedestal of fame which can only be compared with that which has been accorded of late years to the idolized Pietro Mascagni by his fellow-countrymen.\" Gianandrea Gavazzeni made the same comparison: \"The sudden clamors of applause, at the end of the [19th] century, were just like those a decade earlier for Mascagni.\" Perosi worked for five Popes, including Pope Pius X who greatly fostered his rise.\n\nLorenzo Perosi was born at Tortona, Piedmont, in Italy. Many sources give December 20 as Perosi's birthdate but recent scholarship suggests December 21 to be correct. Perosi was one of twelve children, one of six to survive infancy. Perosi hailed from an extremely musical and religious family. For nearly 200 years before him, all of Lorenzo's ancestors were church musicians. His father was Giuseppe Perosi (1849–1908), \"Maestro di Cappella\" (Choir Director) of Tortona Cathedral and one of Italy's most prominent church musicians. Giuseppe was the first teacher of Lorenzo as well as his other two sons, Carlo (who became a priest and then a cardinal) and Marziano (who was Maestro di Cappella at the Duomo of Milan from 1930 to 1949). In Milan Lorenzo studied with respected professor Michele Saladino of the Milan Conservatory. Even when he was not enrolled at the Conservatory, Perosi kept up a correspondence course with Saladino.\n\nIn 1890, 18 years old and still a student, Perosi obtained his first professional post: organist and \"teacher of the piano novices\" at the Abbey of Montecassino. He received his diploma from the Milan Conservatory in 1892, following which he spent an influential year of study with Franz Xaver Haberl in Regensburg, at the Kirchenmusikschule that Haberl had founded in 1874. A noted musician and musicologist, Haberl was the pioneering editor of the complete works of Palestrina and Lassus. Perosi's development was such that Haberl offered him a \"cattedra\" (\"chair,\" or permanent teaching position) in the Kirchenmusikschule. The homesick Perosi politely declined, in favour of a post as teacher and director of sacred music at Imola. As Perosi himself explained, he \"desired and prayed at length to the Lord to be able to do something for the music of God in Italy.\" Perosi served in Imola from November 1892, to August 1894.\n\nIn 1894 Perosi went to Solesmes Abbey to study with the Gregorianists Dom André Mocquereau and Dom Joseph Pothier. The Renaissance polyphony he learned from Haberl, and the Gregorian chant he studied in Solesmes were the two pillars upon which the entire oeuvre of Perosi rested.\n\nFrom Imola, Perosi obtained a more important post, that of Maestro of the Cappella Marciana at San Marco's Basilica in Venice. This Venetian appointment resulted from the deep friendship between Perosi and Cardinal Giuseppe Sarto, then Patriarca di Venezia (Patriarch of Venice) but soon to be Pope Pius X (and still later Pope Saint Pius X). Sarto was a profound music-lover who was disturbed by the roughly hundred years (c.1800–1900) that Gregorian Chant was absent from the Church. A more operatic, entertaining style of music prevailed. Thus, Perosi found in Sarto not only a friend and kindred spirit, but also a staunch sponsor.\n\nPerosi's Venetian appointment (1894) unleashed a torrent of music that lasted at least until 1907. He continued to compose prolifically until his death, but this 13-year period produced some of his most substantial work.\n\nIn 1895, Perosi became a priest, having been ordained by his good friend Cardinal Patriarch Sarto (the later Saint Pius X) himself. It should also be mentioned that St. Luigi Orione was, like Perosi, born in Tortona in 1872. The three men—Orione, Perosi, and Sarto—were all dear friends and mutual inspirers.\n\nDon Perosi was inspired by the later Pope Pius X also to infuse priestly sanctity into the music, and Perosi daily offered Mass and spent many hours in prayer.\n\nIn 1898, Cardinal Sarto used his influence with Pope Leo XIII to get Perosi the post of Maestro Perpetuo della Cappella Sistina, or Perpetual Director of the Sistine Choir, in Rome. Five years later, Sarto was elected Pope Pius X. Just months after his coronation, he released a Motu Proprio \"Tra le sollecitudini\" on sacred music. It gave Gregorian Chant a privileged status as the ideal form of liturgical music, banned women vocalists, severely restricted the use of any instrument but the organ, and prohibited the adaptation of secular music for church use.\n\nPerosi remained Maestro Perpetuo until his death over 50 years later, in spite of interruptions in his directorship. After 1907, Perosi began to suffer more intensely from psychological and neurological problems, caused by his problematic (probably breech-) birth. These afflictions reached their apex in 1922; many declared him \"incurable.\" The composer did spend many months in comparative seclusion; some sources suggest he was briefly institutionalized, although recent scholarship suggests that this was not the case, and that he did not change residence in 1922. In fact, the very next year, 1923, Perosi had fully resumed his administrative and compositional activity; in the last decade of his life, he also maintained a busy conducting schedule.\n\nAccording to biographer Graziella Merlatti, Perosi was the most prolific composer of sacred music of the 20th century. According to musicologist Arturo Sacchetti's estimate, Perosi composed 3,000–4,000 works. A great many still await publication; some have not yet been located. All of the sources mentioned in the bibliography agree that Perosi was the most influential composer of the Cecilian Movement.\n\nDespite the relative obscurity of his name today, Perosi was a prominent member of the Giovane Scuola, of which the most important Verismo composers or Veristi (Puccini, Mascagni, Leoncavallo, Giordano, and Cilea) were all considered members. An entire chapter is dedicated to Perosi in Romain Rolland's \"Musiciens d’Aujourd’hui\" (1899). Perosi was deeply admired not only by Rolland and by the above-named Veristi, but also by Boito, Toscanini, and many others. Caruso sang his music, as did Sammarco, Tagliabue, Gigli, and other great singers from that era, and also quite a few in modern times, such as Fiorenza Cossotto, Mirella Freni, Renato Capecchi, and fellow Tortonese Giuseppe Campora. His French admirers included Debussy, Massenet, Guilmant and d'Indy, all of whom were impressed by the 1899 French Première of \"La Risurrezione di Cristo\".\nUnlike the other members of the Giovane Scuola, Perosi was significantly influenced by pre-Classical repertoire. Romain Rolland reports that Perosi said, \"Great artists formerly were more eclectic than ourselves, and less fettered by their nationalities. ...We must do as they did. We must try to recreate an art in which the arts of all countries and all times are blended.\" \n\nIn his day, Perosi was best known for his oratorios, large-scale works for chorus, soloists, and orchestra based on Latin texts. While the works can seem slow-paced today, at the time they were quite novel not only for their fusion of Renaissance polyphony, Gregorian chant, and lush, Verismo melodies and orchestrations, but also for Perosi's deep-seated faith in the words that he had set. The oratorio as a genre had been in decline in the preceding centuries, and Perosi's contributions to the canon brought him brief but significant international acclaim.\n\nIn addition to the oratorios and masses for which he is best known, Perosi also wrote secular music—symphonic poems, chamber music, concertos, etc. In his youth, he also wrote pieces for organ.\n\nGiacomo Puccini is quoted as saying that \"There's more music in Perosi's head than in mine and Mascagni's put together.\" \n\n\n\n\nPerosi was succeeded as director of the Sistine Choir and Papal musician by his assistant, monsignor Domenico Bartolucci (born Borgo San Lorenzo, May 7, 1917) in 1956, who remained at this post until 1997. Bartolucci, who was rehabilitated in 2006 under Pope Benedict XVI, has been harshly critical of Perosi, whom he has blamed for the deterioration of Church music.\n\n\n"}

The distinctive rock is largely confined to the English county of Hertfordshire but small amounts occur throughout the London Basin. Despite a superficial similarity to concrete, it is an entirely natural silcrete. A fracture runs across both the pebbles and the sandy matrix as both have equal strength unlike concrete where the pebbles remain whole and a fracture occurs only in the matrix. Like other puddingstones, it derives its name from the manner in which the embedded flints resemble the plums in a pudding. It forms the local base of the Upnor Formation of the Lambeth Group.\n\nThe flints were eroded from the surrounding chalk beds some 56 million years ago in the Eocene epoch and were transported by water action to beaches, where they were rounded by wave erosion and graded by size. A lowering of sea levels and general drying during a brief arid period known as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum drew out silica from surrounding rocks into the water immersing the flint pebbles. Further drying precipitated the silica which hardened around the pebbles, trapping them in the matrix.\n\nPuddingstone is rarely found in situ in the strata but its hardness has preserved loose rocks and boulders commonly found in river beds, and less frequently exposed at the surface. A well researched outcrop lies at Colliers End near Ware. Another large piece lies at the bottom of the trout lake in Fisheries Road, Hemel Hempstead. This was discovered by contractors deepening the lake in 1975. It is 30 ft x 20 ft by 3–4 feet thick.\n\nOxides of iron were also trapped in the silica matrix, giving rise to many different hues when the puddingstone is examined closely. From a greater distance, puddingstone is generally brown or ginger in colour, although pink is possible. The density of flint inclusions shows notable variation between specimens.\n\nRock similar to the sand matrix of Hertfordshire Puddingstone, and with similar silica cement, but lacking the pebbles, occurs further west in Southern England, and is called Sarsen stone. It was used in part of the construction of Stonehenge.\n\nThe silica is very hard, which led to use being made of puddingstone as an auxiliary building material supplementing flintstone buildings such as St Mary's Church, Stocking Pelham; as a decorative feature or waymark in , such as at Watton-at-Stone; or, during Roman times, for grinding corn. A fragment of a quern stone made from puddingstone was found by archaeologist Dominic Shelley on the site of a Romano-British farmstead in Great Eversden, Cambridgeshire.\n\nHertfordshire puddingstone was credited in local folklore with several supernatural powers, including being a protective charm against witchcraft. Parish records from the village of Aldenham relate that in 1662 a woman suspected of having been a witch was buried with a piece of it laid on top of her coffin to prevent her from escaping after burial. In living memory a piece of Pudding Stone was given to a bride and groom, possibly as a fertility symbol. Its supposed magical powers gave it the names of woe stone, hag stone or witch stone. It was also called grow stone or breeding stone because of a related belief that it could multiply itself.\n\n\n"}

The junior high was phased out with the opening of Edison Junior High (now Edison Middle) School in 1970.

{"id": "2336395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2336395", "title": "Earth X", "text": "Earth X\n\nEarth X is a 1999 comic book limited series published by American company Marvel Comics. \"Earth X\" was written by Jim Krueger with art by John Paul Leon. Based on Alex Ross' notes, the series features a dystopian version of the Marvel Universe.\n\nThe series was followed by two sequels, Universe X, Paradise X and a prequel Marvels X. The universe of \"Earth X\" is designated as Earth-9997.\n\n\"Earth X\" began in 1997 when \"Wizard\" magazine asked Alex Ross to create a possible dystopian future for Marvel. Ross designed a future where all ordinary humans had gained superpowers, and he examined how some of the most well-known Marvel characters (including Spider-Man, Captain America and the Incredible Hulk) would manage a world where their superhero powers had now become commonplace. The issue of \"Wizard\" that contained the Ross article sold out rapidly. Demand was so extensive that in 1999 (in affiliation with Marvel), they republished the article as the \"Earth X Sketchbook\", which also sold out. Based on this indicator of fan interest, Marvel commissioned Ross to create a full series based on his notes.\n\nEarth X is one of a number of planets implanted with a gestating Celestial egg. About ten years after the end of the heroic age, Black Bolt releases the mutagenic Terrigen Mists into Earth's atmosphere, seeking to transform humanity into Inhumans so that his people would not suffer persecution.\n\nHe blinded Uatu the Watcher to prevent him from witnessing his actions, and Black Bolt and the Inhumans leave Earth. Unable to operate his observation equipment, Uatu transports X-51 (Machine Man)—who has long since given up super-heroics to imitate the life of his human creator—to the Moon to act as Earth's new Watcher. X-51 gets increasingly annoyed at Uatu's assurance of the heroes' defeat.\n\nAfter killing Red Skull, Captain America quits the Avengers, considering himself unfit for the team. Shortly afterward, Reed Richards constructs a worldwide network of vibranium power centers to solve the looming energy crisis, but the experiment fails when one of Reed's scientists falls into the reactor, causing a worldwide explosive chain reaction. The scientist that fell into the reactor became encased within vibranium and discovered that she can manipulate the rare metal, becoming the Iron Maiden.\n\nThe Terrigen Mists begin mutating Earth's human population, though much of the world blames \"Plague X\" on Richards' failed experiment. Benny Beckley, the young son of Comet Man, gains the ability to control the actions of others and becomes known as Skull. Nearly all of the world's telepaths are killed by the backlash caused by Beckley's power manifestation. Meanwhile, Doctor Doom and Namor the Sub-Mariner fight the Fantastic Four. Doom is killed in an explosion along with Susan Richards. Namor kills Johnny Storm. Franklin Richards responds by cursing Namor, causing one side of his body to burst into flame upon contact with air, forcing Namor back into the ocean. A distraught Reed Richards dons Doom's armor and exiles himself to Castle Doom in Latveria.\n\nSoon after, the Absorbing Man absorbs Ultron. The Vision defeats the Absorbing Man with a computer virus. Attempting to isolate the virus by turning to stone, the Absorbing Man is shattered by the Vision after murdering the Avengers. Absorbing Man's pieces are scattered amongst the world's leaders so that he can never be reassembled.\n\nNorman Osborn manipulates America into electing him President by using alien DNA to create the Hydra—a parasite collective that mind-controls its host bodies—and grants Tony Stark (one of the last unmutated humans) political asylum in exchange for constructing robotic replicas of the fallen Avengers to battle the Hydra menace.\n\nLoki tricked Odin into changing Thor into a female and discovers an elaborate Celestial manipulation on a cosmic scale: ancient humans were modified by the Celestials, given the ability to develop powers in order to act as a type of anti-bodies meant to stop radical elements such as deviants and alien species from harming the Earth and the Celestial embryo growing within it. Along with Earth, the Celestials modified the native species of many planets harboring Celestial embryos. Species affected by Celestial modification gradually undergo an evolution process where they develop powers either through natural means such as mutants, or unnatural means such as meta-humans like Spider-Man. Species with Celestial modifications in theory hold enough power to rival the celestials, but are inhibited by a clever psychological safeguard put in place by the Celestials. The safeguard relates to constructivist philosophy, that essentially states that people are shaped by their environment. The deities and devils within the Marvel universe are species that were modified by Celestials and unwittingly inhibit their own abilities due to the fact that they self-identify as a Marvel deity or devil. These evolved beings hold their sense of identity being reinforced by those that interact with them. Loki realizes that he was only the evil son of Odin and a Norse God because when he evolved beyond his mortal form his psyche became a tabula rasa. The first interaction that he had with another in that form were Nordic humans who thought that he was an evil god and thus he became one.\n\nMeanwhile, Captain America and his partner Redwing learn that the Skull is gathering a mind-controlled army. After Redwing is overcome by the Skull's powers, Captain America retreats and recruits allies to fight the Skull.\n\nMeanwhile, the Inhuman Royal Family return from space and contact Reed Richards, hoping to reunite with their people. While trying to find the lost Inhuman nation with Cerebro, Richards discovers Bolt's actions. The Skull's army reaches New York, overtaking it, and Captain America and his allies fall to the Skull's powers. While the Skull is distracted, Captain America kills the child dictator and liberates his followers.\n\nBefore the heroes can celebrate, the Celestials arrive on Earth to germinate the embryo. As the Celestials prepare to attack New York, Loki arrives with a host of Asgardians found in the afterlife and announces he's not bad because he formed the Avengers. Tony Stark sacrifices himself while trying to hold off the arriving Celestials. Black Bolt is killed just after using his voice to travel across the universe and call for Galactus, who is revealed to be devouring worlds in order to destroy Celestial embryos growing within them. Galactus kills several Celestials and forces the others to flee. Afterwards, Galactus consumes Earth's Celestial embryo. Galactus prepares to leave, and Reed requests that he remove his helmet. Galactus reluctantly agrees, revealing that he is actually Franklin Richards. Franklin Richards previously convinced himself that he was Galactus, willingly sacrificing his own identity to turn into the destroyer of worlds after realizing that Galactus needed to exist in order to keep the Celestial population in check. This needed to be done after the Fantastic Four killed the original Galactus with the ultimate nullifier. Reed Richards also realizes this fact and makes the heartbreaking decision to not remind Franklin of who he originally was for the sake of the universe.\n\nX-51 realizes the Watchers' true purpose is to watch over Celestial eggs because one of their numbers failed to stop the birth of Galactus millions of years ago. X-51 destroys Uatu's ears and decides to destroy all Celestial eggs gestating inside the various planets within the universe. Reed converts his vibranium power network into \"Human Torches\", hoping to burn off the Terrigen Mists and restore Earth's human population.\n\nWith the Celestial embryo gone, the Earth's mass is reduced, causing a shift in orbit and polarity as well as drastic worldwide climate changes. One-fourth of New York's population dies as temperatures plummet. The Tong of Creel, a cult dedicated to reassembling the Absorbing Man, begins killing those who hold his fragments. Under Mephisto's influence, Pope Immortus founds a church advocating mutant dominance of the galaxy and the destruction of Reed's Human Torches. Meanwhile, Mar-Vell is reincarnated as the child of the synthetic Him and Her, though his soul remains in the Realm of the Dead. Captain America becomes the Mar-Vell child's guardian and embarks on a worldwide quest with his new ward to obtain various items in order to deal with Earth's restless mutant population and prepare for an impending war in the Realm of the Dead. Arriving at Zero Street, the duo is attacked by the Night People, and Captain America sacrifices his life to save the Mar-Vell child.\n\nMar-Vell reveals that other than creating constructivist safeguards to stop species that they modified from being able to challenge their supremacy, the Celestials also schemed to manipulate causality and fatalism by helping to create beings such as death and Mephisto to distort truth and reality. Mar-Vell also discovered that beings that travel through time actually create new universes in the process of doing so and Celestials, acting through others such as Mephisto, encouraged time travel as it created entirely new universes for the Celestial to inhabit and grow in number.\n\nWhen the Tong of Creel finally reassembles the Absorbing Man in New York, he attacks the city's Human Torch. Battling New York's heroes, the Absorbing Man absorbs Manhattan itself, adding its buildings and streets to his being, but Loki and Iron Maiden convince the villain to transform himself into vibranium and use his mass to stabilize the planet's fluctuating orbit and polarity. Meanwhile, in the Realm of the Dead, Mar-Vell leads an army of deceased heroes and villains against Thanos and Death. With the artifacts collected by himself and Captain America in his possession, Mar-Vell shows Thanos how Death has manipulated him and convinces Thanos to use the Ultimate Nullifier on the entity.\n\nWith Death destroyed, Mar-Vell constructs a Paradise in the center of the Negative Zone for the dead to inhabit. However, those among the living find themselves unable to die.\n\nMeanwhile, X-51 decides that the inhabitants of alternate Earths should be warned about the Celestial embryos he believes are growing within their planets. He spreads the alarm across the multiverse by recruiting and dispatching Heralds from alternate timelines such as Bloodstorm (Ororo Monroe, Earth-1298), Deathlok (Luther Manning, Earth-7484), Hyperion (Earth-1121), Killraven (Earth-691), Iron Man 2020 (Earth-8410), Spider-Girl (Earth-1122), and Wolverine (Days of Future Past Earth-811).\n\nAfter banishing the Watchers of Earth-9997 to alternate worlds with the hope that their presence will lead to the discovery and destruction of each Celestial embryo, X-51 takes his Heralds to his Earth, where he will aid each in achieving his or her wishes. In Mar-Vell's Paradise, the High Evolutionary's equipment transforms the souls of Black Bolt, Captain America, Daredevil (Matt Murdock), Dr. Doom, Giant-Man, Phoenix, and Tony Stark into the Avenging Host, charged with ushering souls from the Realm of the Dead to Paradise. Those who enter Paradise consume a piece of the Cosmic Cube, enabling them to create their own, seemingly perfect pocket reality. But as more souls enter Paradise, it begins to expand and consume entire worlds within the Negative Zone, causing Blastaar and Annihilus to attack the Baxter Building in New York.\n\nReed Richards, Bruce Banner, the Beast, and several other brilliant scientists convene to discuss a solution to Death's absence. They decide to access the imprisoned Jude the Entropic Man, who can turn others to dust on contact, and synthesize his essence into a chemical to end the suffering of those unable to die. With the chemical complete, Reed, growing suspicious of Mar-Vell's motives, plans to use Pym Particles to slow Paradise's rapid growth within the Negative Zone. Mephisto frees Jude from captivity, convincing him to go on a killing spree. Mephisto then steers Jude to Britain, where Mephisto hopes to find the Siege Perilous, which will allow him to traverse the multiverse. With the help of Merlin, Doctor Strange, Psylocke and the sacrifice of a recently resurrected Meggan, King Britain is able to slay Mephisto with Excalibur. Meanwhile, in Paradise, Reed and a legion of heroes confront Mar-Vell. After Paradise is nearly conquered in the name of the Supreme Intelligence by the arriving souls of the Kree military, Mar-Vell explains to Reed that he (Reed) is to become the new Eternity.\n\nUsing his new role as Eternity, Reed is able to end the conflict and free the remaining heroes from their Cosmic Cube-induced dream-worlds. Once this is accomplished, Mar-Vell explains to Reed that his plan is to build a wall around their universe, preventing any further influence from the Celestials. Feeling that his work is not yet complete, Mar-Vell tells the people of Paradise that he is going to the source of Excalibur, which is strongly implied to be the original universe.\nA prequel to the Earth X series called Marvels X written by the same team who did Earth X.It focuses on the last normal human being on earth named David as he deals with the aftermath of the terrigans mist that turns most of the individuals of earth into super powered beings and freaks..Though the title is named after the previous series called Marvels written by Kurt Busiek and Alex Ross, it is however not connected to that series though it has some reference to the series protagonist Phil Sheldon.\n\n\n\nAfter Mar-Vell killed Death, he reshaped part of the Realm of the Dead into a paradise and selected a group of dead heroes to be its guardians called the Avenging Host where most of its members have angel-like forms.\n\n\nThe Fantastic Four no longer exist with the exception of Invisible Woman.\n\n\n\nThis is the new incarnation of the X-Men that is led by Cyclops. They were former members of the second Daredevil's circus:\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially, the \"Earth X\" storyline was purported as being the future of Earth-616. However, the series often substantially retconned the origins and workings of characters to better suit the story, to the point where they were no longer reconcilable with their counterparts in the mainstream Marvel Universe. One example is the revelation in \"Paradise X\" that Wolverine is not a mutant, but instead one of the few remaining \"pure strain humans\", free from the genetic manipulations of the Celestials (as well as a descendant of Moon-Boy). Marvel editors solved these discrepancies by officially declaring that anything stated in \"Earth X\" would not be considered canonical. It is later revealed in issue #11 of \"Paradise X\" that the events shown in the series are not set in an alternative future, but rather an alternative present (the issue reveals that \"Paradise X\" is set in 2003, the year of publication).\n\nThe \"Paradise X\" series was never properly concluded, due to editorial interference midway through its publication. Due to dwindling sales, the \"X\" and \"A\" specials, which were intended to be double-sized issues, were both reduced to 22 pages and the intended ending was never used. Writer Jim Krueger expressed dismay at the loss of pages and not being able to use the original ending. In the intended ending, Captain America, suspecting Captain Marvel's treachery, would have killed Marvel just as Marvel put the energy wall around the universe to keep out the Celestials and Elders. At this final moment, having ascended to the throne of Paradise, Captain America would have realized that Marvel's intentions were good. \"Cap would have sat on the throne, completely unworthy of it. And this, this would have been the final testing necessary to make Cap worthy of it.\"\n\nAdditionally, a planned limited series, \"Tales of Earth X\", was proposed but never greenlighted. The series, set before the events of \"Earth X\", would have revealed the final days of characters like Professor X before the mutation that turned the world into mutants and killed all of Earth's psychics.\n\nA one-shot called \"The Earth X Companion\" was released in 2008, containing production notes and sketches by Jim Krueger and Alex Ross as well as a short story drawn by artist Bill Reinhold detailing the fate of one of Nick Fury's Life Model Decoys.\n\nIn September 2005, Marvel released a 592-page hardcover deluxe edition of \"Earth X\". This new edition includes 12 issues of the \"Earth X\" regular series, the #0 and #X bookends, the #1/2 issue (drawn by artist Bill Reinhold) and the Epilogue.

Creationism is based on the idea of a poem as a truly \"new\" thing, created by the author for the sake of itself—that is, not to praise another thing, not to please the reader, not even to be understood by its own author.\n\nHuidobro himself defined it as \"a general aesthetic theory\" rather than a school of art. He proposed that poetry should not be a commentary, something written about something else. In his own words:\n\nHuidobro cites as inspiration some \"admirable poems\" of Tristan Tzara, though their \"creation\" is more formal than fundamental, and also some works by Francis Picabia, Georges Ribémont Dessaignes, Paul Éluard, and the Spanish poets Juan Larrea and Gerardo Diego (which Huidobro calls \"the two Spanish creationist poets\").\n\nThe poet also claims that creationist poetry is by its own nature universal and universally translatable, \"since the new facts remain identical in all tongues\", while the other elements that prevail in non-creationist poetry, such as the rhyme and music of the words, vary among languages and cannot be easily translated, thus causing the poem to lose part of its essence.\n\n\n"}

He bought property on a large scale and became wealthy.\n\nHe was starting to hand over control to his daughter Debbie when she died of a heroin overdose in 1992, after which he became a recluse.\n\nRaymond was born and raised in Liverpool to a Roman Catholic family; the family was abandoned by the father (a lorry driver) when Raymond was five with the result that he was brought up by his mother, who refused to allow the \"News of the World\" in the family home. Raymond attended St Francis Xavier's College. The outbreak of World War II prompted relocation to Glossop, Derbyshire, where he was educated by the Irish Christian Brothers.\n\nLeaving school at 15, he was a Manchester Ship Canal office boy before taking up the drums with dance bands. He tied to avoid military service as a Bevin Boy down a coal mine, but gave up after a day and was found by police two years later. Feigning a heart condition (a heart murmur via many saccharine tablets and bread), he passed his medical ranked A1, and evaded imprisonment. During his National Service in the Royal Air Force, he worked as a switchboard operator and bandsman. A self-confessed spiv, he sold nylons and petrol coupons on the black market. His name change occurred when, at 22, he attempted a show business career as a mind-reader on Clacton pier.\n\nThe Lord Chamberlain's Office then controlled what was allowed on theatre stages and ruled that nudes could not move, thus when Raymond toured with a show featuring nudes they were presented as statues, which moved about the stage on podiums. Raymond's preference, in this context, was for women between 18 and 30 years old, 5 feet 8 inches tall and with a chest measurement of no more than 36 inches. The reason for the latter provision, Raymond explained, was that \"I wouldn’t like to embarrass my customers\". \n\nHe also circumvented the authority of the Lord Chamberlain's powers in 1958 when he opened the Raymond Revuebar strip club as a private club in the former Doric Ballroom in Soho's Walker's Court. He had been unimpressed with the first legal strip club in Soho, believing he could do better. Within two years, Raymond's Revuebar had 45,000 members. He also bought the freehold of his venue for £14,000 within a year or two, the beginnings of his property portfolio in Soho.\n\nAccording to Raymond's biographer, Paul Willetts, Raymond's Revuebar initially attracted a \"chic clientele\", including the actor John Mills and comedian Peter Sellers. The seedy reputation of the club led to regular clashes with the authorities about show content. In 1961, his club was called \"filthy, disgusting and beastly\" by the chairman of the London Sessions when Raymond was fined £5,000 (then about $12,500) following a magistrate's decision that permitting members to ring the Ding Dong Girl's bells constituted running a disorderly house. There was also the issue about an onstage snake charmer who it was ruled should not have swallowed the snake in public.\n\nRaymond first moved into publishing in 1964 when he launched the men's magazine \"King\", but it ceased publication after two issues. In 1971, he took over the adult title \"Men Only\"; his other magazines eventually included \"Razzle\" and \"Mayfair\". Among the models featured in his magazines was Fiona Richmond, who became Raymond's girlfriend. Jean Bradley was married to Raymond from 1951 to 1974, divorcing him over the relationship with Richmond and received a settlement of £250,000; she died in 2002. Richmond denied breaking the marriage in August 2008.\n\nIn 1974, he purchased the lease on the Windmill Cinema and returned it to the original name, the Windmill Theatre, though he relinquished it in 1986. Other theatres controlled by Raymond included the Whitehall Theatre (acquiring its lease in 1968) where the sex comedy \"Pyjama Tops\" ran for more than five years along with several sequels, and the Royalty Theatre. When strip tease began to decline, Raymond let his Boulevard Theatre within the Revuebar in 1980 to \"The Comic Strip\" team and others pioneering the new \"alternative comedy\" of the time.\n\nRaymond diversified, investing millions into buildings and other property, especially in Soho starting in the 1970s, through his company, Soho Estates. During 1977, when many sex shops and strip clubs were closing because the police were active in closing them down, he was able to buy them cheaply. In that year, he was buying one Soho freehold each week, and also acquired property in Chelsea, Kensington and Hampstead. Raymond owned about 400 properties in the Soho area. He was a frequent name on lists of the UK's wealthy reportedly with an estimated £650 million (at the time about $1.3 billion, in the 2007 \"Sunday Times\" Rich List) One associate claimed the estate was worth billions, though public records of assets overseas did not exist. \"Forbes\" also placed him on its list of US dollar billionaires. \n\nOften dubbed by the press 'King of Soho', he was the target of two extortion attempts, which was disclosed in the October 2010 release of Metropolitan Police papers. The second attempt was from decorators who threatened Raymond with bombing and shooting while pretending to be members of the IRA.\n\nOn 22 January 1967, Raymond was initiated into the Grand Order of Water Rats for his contribution to entertainment in the UK.\n\nAround 1990 Raymond began to hand over control of his empire to his daughter Debbie (Deborah Jane Raymond, born 28 January 1956), but she died from an accidental heroin overdose on 5 November 1992. Debbie served as the editor-in-chief of the company's titles, as well as becoming involved in its property concerns. \n\nRaymond also had two sons; Derry McCarthy (born Darryl) being from a previous relationship prior to his marriage (his proposal for marriage was rejected), and Howard, his son by his wife Jean Bradley. Jean became estranged from him, blaming Debbie's death on Raymond. Raymond acknowledged only four grandchildren: Cheyenne and Boston Raymond, from his son Howard, and Fawn and India Rose James from his daughter Debbie. Mark Quinn, a nephew, oversaw much of Raymond's business in his later years.\n\nA recluse in his last years and living in a penthouse near the Ritz Hotel, he died of prostate cancer and respiratory failure in 2008, aged 82. His granddaughters Fawn and India James inherited his estate once estimated at £600 million in \"The Sunday Times\" Rich List in 2004. He had been estimated as worth £1.5 billion in 1994, overtaking the Duke of Westminster as Britain's wealthiest man. Fawn announced her intention to commit to charity work in 2010. Their combined wealth was estimated as £454 million in \"The Sunday Times\" Rich List of 2015.\n\n\"The Look of Love\" (released 26 April 2013) is about his life: Michael Winterbottom (director), Steve Coogan (Raymond), Anna Friel (wife, Jean), Imogen Poots (daughter, Debbie) and then-current Paul Raymond Publications employees and editors (extras or pseudo-cameos). The working title was \"The King of Soho\", but this was changed as Howard Raymond had already trademarked it for another (as yet unmade) drama about his father's life; he stated that he had \"never wanted or sought\" to prevent Winterbottom's film being made.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2336412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2336412", "title": "Jacques de Lalaing", "text": "Jacques de Lalaing\n\nJacques de Lalaing (1421–1453), perhaps the most renowned knight of Burgundy in the 15th century, was reportedly one of the best medieval tournament fighters of all time. A Walloon knight, he began his military career in the service of Adolph I, Duke of Cleves, but was quickly noticed by Philip III (the Good) Duke of Burgundy by whom he was knighted and who he went on to serve. Jacques, known as the \"\"Bon Chevalier\"\" (Good Knight) due to his military prowess in tournaments and battles, became the most famous Burgundian knight of his time, and was well-known throughout Europe as one of the best medieval tournament fighters. Jacques was inducted into the prestigious Burgundian chivalric order, the Order of the Golden Fleece, in 1451. Jacques' deeds in tournaments and battles were recorded in the \"Livre des Faits de Jacques Lalaing (The Book of the Deeds of Jacques de Lalaing)\" attributed mainly to the Burgundian chroniclers Jean Le Fevre de Saint-Remy, Georges Chastellain, and the herald Charolais. Throughout his life, Jacques was entrusted by the Duke of Burgundy to serve in delegations to the King of France and the Pope, as well as with the suppression of the Revolt of Ghent in 1453.\n\nJacques was born to the prominent Lalaing family in the County of Hainaut, the eldest son of Guillaume de Lalaing and Jeanne de Crequy. Jacques had three brothers: John who was provost of Saint-Lambert's Cathedral in Liege, Philippe who was a godson of Philip the Good, and Antoine who was killed by the Swiss while fighting for the Duke of Burgundy Charles the Bold. Jacques also had a half-brother named John who was the Lord of Haubourdin. Additionally, Jacques had three sisters: Yoland who married the Lord of Brederode and Baron of Holland, Isabeau who married Pierre of Henin-Lietard Lord of Bossu and Great Baron of Hainaut, and Jeanne of Esclaibes who married Philippe of Bourbon, Lord of Ducing.\n\nJacques was the nephew of Simon de Lalaing who was the Admiral of Flanders from 1436 to 1462. Simon was also renowned for his military prowess as a knight and was a member of the Order of the Golden Fleece.\n\nAs a child, Jacques was well-educated since literature was cultivated in Burgundy at the time of his youth. Therefore, he was learned in both Latin and French, and accomplished in literary work. But it was in warlike sports that he excelled the most. At a young age he went to the court of Philip the Good to serve and eventually become a knight. In 1436, he was sent by the Duke of Burgundy with 600 fighters to serve the King of France under the command of Marshal Jean de Villiers de L'Isle-Adam.\n\nBy the age of 20, Jacques had distinguished himself at a number of tournaments. On 22 November 1443 he accompanied Philip the Good's forces in a surprise assault on the city of Luxembourg where he \"accomplished many magnificent feats of arms with both the lance and the sword.\"\nTwo years later in 1445, Jacques took part in a tournament in Nancy, Lorraine, France, where there were assembled King Charles VII of France, King Alfonso V of Aragon, and the nobility of France. Jacques performed spectacularly and was victorious over all of the knights with whom he did combat. For this success, he not only gained further celebrity status but received many material rewards.\n\nAlso in 1445, Jacques began his famous Feats of Arms. In these, he and another knight would fight a pre-arranged duel in full armor with sharpened weapons. The participants decided the rules of combat beforehand. Fighting typically included three courses each: with the lance on horseback, the sword on horseback, and the spear, poleaxe, sword, or dagger on foot. Sometimes these fights simply went on until one combatant was on the ground. Jacques' first feat of arms was against an Italian knight named Jean de Boniface from the court of King Alfonso V of Aragon. Jean had traveled through Lombardy, Savoy, Burgundy, and Flanders, seeking to distinguish himself in combat. Upon his arrival in Antwerp he made it known that he would take on all comers in combat. Jacques accepted this challenge and beat him.\n\nThe example of Jean de Boniface made a strong impression on Jacques, and in 1446 he decided to take up the profession of knight-errant, traveling from court to court with his entourage of 80 to 100 men-at-arms searching for opportunities to gain fighting acclaim. Traveling to France, and then to Navarre and Castile, Jacques sought combat with whoever would fight. Unfortunately, both King Charles VII of France and King John II of Navarre denied him permission to fight, probably because they did not want to spend money on an expensive tournament. However, after riding through Spain and Portugal, he was given the chance to fight in Valladolid on 3 February 1447, when King John II of Castile allowed him to fight Diego de Guzman, the son of the Grandmaster of the Spanish Order of Calatrava. Combat began on foot, and Jacques was so successful in beating his rival that the mounted combat never took place. On his way back home to Hainault, Jacques stopped in Aragon but was refused permission to fight yet again.\n\nIn 1449, Jacques traveled to Stirling, Scotland, to fight against members of the Douglas clan at the court of King James II of Scotland. A combat of six took place, with Jacques fighting alongside his uncle Simon de Lalaing and a squire from Brittany named Herve de Meriadec. Their opponents were James Douglas the brother of the Earl of Douglas, another James Douglas, and John Ross of Halket. The audience numbered five or six thousand. Jacques' side was victorious.\n\nAfter the victory in Scotland, Jacques and his companions traveled to England where they were denied permission to fight by King Henry VI of England. But shortly before his departure to return home, Jacques was challenged by an English squire named Thomas Que to fight in Burgundy. This combat took place later in 1449 in Bruges, Flanders with the Duke of Burgundy as referee. While initially Thomas' poleaxe was disqualified due to its being oversized and oversharp, he pleaded so persistently that Jacques allowed its use. During combat, Jacque was stabbed through the wrist by Thomas' poleaxe, but went on to win the combat anyway.\n\nLater, on that same day, Jacques announced his intention to raise a pavilion and have a pas d'armes (passage of arms). He desired to take on all comers for a set time period, specifically on the first day of every month for a year. Jacques' pas d'armes challenge was officially known as the Passage of the Fountain of Tears. This was due to the pavilion being next to a fountain with a statue of a weeping woman. In keeping with this theme, Jacques fought in a white surcoat decorated with a pattern of blue tears. The reason given for having this pas d'armes was that Jacques wanted to fight 30 men before his 30th birthday. It lasted from 1 November 1449 to 30 September 1450.\n\nNo one was willing to accept Jacques' challenge until 1 February 1450. This challenger was a Burgundian squire named Pierre de Chandio. The fighting took place in Chalons, France, on a small island in the middle of the Saône River. It began with a great ceremony, although the combat was uneventful as Jacques won handily over Pierre. In March, Sir Jean de Boniface who Jacques had beaten previously, returned to challenge him. The first day's combat was inconclusive, but during the second day's combat Jacques was able to again beat Jean. In June, a Burgundian squire named Gerard de Roussillon accepted the challenge. Jacques quickly won this combat. On 1 October 1450, seven noblemen accepted the challenge. The first was a squire named Claude Pitois, lord of Saint-Bonnet. The second was Aime de Rabutin, lord of Espiry. The third was a squire named Jean de Villeneuve. The fourth was named Gaspar de Durtain. The fifth was Jacques d'Avanchier. The sixth was a Burgundian squire named Guillaume d'Amange. And the seventh was a squire named Jean Pitois. Combat began on the next day. While initially several of these bouts were draws, Jacques would go on to win against all comers. As the pas d'armes ended, Jacques remained undefeated, winning great renown. Afterward he made a pilgrimage to Rome, returning in triumph to the court of Philip the Good. As a reward for his valor, Jacques was then admitted into the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1451 in the town of Mons.\n\nOn his pilgrimage to Rome in 1450, Jacques, like a medieval chivalrous knight of old, \"like another Lancelot,\" stayed at Chalons on the Marne and crossed lances with anyone who would fight him on the road.\n\nIn 1452, Jacques jousted against Charles, Count of Charolais, who would go on to be Duke of Burgundy Charles the Bold in 1467. This was Charles' first jousting tournament. In the first joust Jacques broke his lance upon the Count but did not unhorse him. In the second joust, both broke their lances upon each other, yet both stayed in the saddle. Philip the Good considered it a good match and delightfully ended the bout. The Count would go on to win the prize of the tournament. This was the last tournament that Jacques would participate in since war broke out soon afterward.\n\nThroughout his life, Jacques displayed all the main elements of what was considered to be the perfect medieval chivalrous knight. His military prowess was unmatched, he came from a respected and noble family, at a young age his frank bearing was noticeable, throughout his life he showed great loyalty to his lord the Duke of Burgundy, as a young man he was known to be a favorite of the ladies at court, his largesse was evident after his victories, and his religious piety was shown by such actions as his pilgrimage to Rome in 1450. He truly seems to have been the culmination of medieval chivalric ideals.\n\nJacques was killed in battle during the Revolt of Ghent on 3 July 1453, fighting for Philip the Good. While minor details differ, it appears that he was killed by cannon fire from defenders of Poucques Castle. He is one of the first European noblemen to die from gunfire. Jacques is therefore a transitional character, the last great member of a chivalrous era destroyed by an element of changing modern times.\n\nPhilip the Good was so furious at the death of his favorite knight Jacques that when the Poucques Castle was taken he had all those captured in it hanged, priests, lepers and children excepted.\n\nJacques was buried in the church of Lalaing. Before the French Revolution an epitaph to Jacques was in the Notre Dame Cathedral.\n\n"}

{"id": "2336416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2336416", "title": "William McIntosh", "text": "William McIntosh\n\nWilliam McIntosh (1775 – April 30, 1825), also known as \"Tustunnuggee Hutke\" (White Warrior), was one of the most prominent chiefs of the Creek Nation between the turn of the nineteenth century and his execution in 1825. He was a chief of Coweta town and commander of a mounted police force. He became a planter who owned slaves, an inn, and a ferry business.\n\nEarlier American historians attributed McIntosh's achievements and influence to his mixed race Scots/European ancestry. Since the late 20th century, some revisionist historians have contended that his power stemmed more from his Creek upbringing, particularly his mother's prominent Wind Clan in the Creek matrilineal system, and to other aspects of Creek culture.\n\nBecause McIntosh led a group that negotiated and signed a treaty in 1825 to cede much of remaining Creek lands to the United States in violation of Creek law, for the first time the Creek National Council ordered that a Creek be executed for crimes against the Nation. It sentenced him and other signatories to death. McIntosh was executed by Menawa and a large force of Law Menders in late April 1825; two other signatories were executed and one was shot but escaped. Menawa signed a treaty in 1826 that was similar, but that the Council had agreed to and that provided more benefits to the Creek.\n\nMcIntosh's descendants were removed with the other Creek people to Indian Territory. His two sons served as Confederate officers during the American Civil War. His daughters, Rebecca and Delilah, moved to East Texas with their husbands, developing plantations there. Rebecca McIntosh Hawkins Hagerty married again after her first husband died young, and by 1860 was the wealthiest woman in Texas, owning three plantations with a total of 12,800 acres and 120 slaves.\n\n\"Tustunnuggee Hutke\" (White Warrior) was born in the Lower Town of Coweta in present-day Georgia to \"Senoya\" (also spelled \"Senoia\" and \"Senoy\"), a member of the Wind Clan, which was prominent in the Creek Nation. As the Creek had a matrilineal kinship system, through which property and hereditary positions were passed, his mother's status determined that of White Warrior. The boy was also named after his father, the Scots-American Captain William McIntosh, who was connected to a prominent Savannah, Georgia family. Captain McIntosh, a Loyalist during the American Revolutionary War, had worked with the Creek to recruit them as military allies to the British. The senior McIntosh's mother was Margaret \"Mary\" McGillivray, believed to have been a sister of the Scot Lachlan McGillivray, a wealthy fur trader and planter in Georgia. After the Revolutionary War, Captain McIntosh moved from the frontier to Savannah to settle. There he married a paternal cousin, Barbara McIntosh.\n\nWhite Warrior gained his status and place among the Creek from his mother's clan. Benjamin Hawkins, first appointed as United States Indian agent in the Southeast and then as Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the territory south of the Ohio River, lived among the Creek and Choctaw, and knew them well. He commented in letters to President Thomas Jefferson that Creek women were matriarchs and had control of children \"when connected with a white man.\" Hawkins further observed that even wealthy traders were nearly as \"inattentive\" to their mixed-race children as \"the Indians\". What he did not understand about the Creek culture was that the children had a closer relationship with their mother's eldest brother than with their biological father, because of the importance of the clan structure.\n\nThe son McIntosh was considered a skilled orator and politician; he became a wealthy planter and slaveholder; and he was influential in both Creek and European-American society. One of his cousins was George Troup, who became governor of Georgia when McIntosh was a prominent chief. Whites sometimes mistakenly assumed that McIntosh had centralized authority over the Creek, but he was still among numerous chiefs and the central power became the Creek National Council, especially after it adopted the Code of 1818.\n\nFor generations, Creek chiefs had approved their daughters' marriages to fur traders in order to strengthen their alliances and trading power with the wealthy Europeans. Through both his mother and father, McIntosh was related to numerous other influential Creek chiefs, most of whom were \"métis\", of Creek mothers and white fathers, who were valued as husbands. The most prominent were Alexander McGillivray (1750-1793), the son of Sehoy, a Wind Clan mother, and Lachlan McGillivray; and William Weatherford (c.1780-1824), also born to the Wind Clan.\n\nBoth McIntosh and Weatherford became well established as Creek chiefs and wealthy planters, but Weatherford was aligned with the traditionalist Red Sticks of the Upper Towns in the period of the Creek Wars. He and McIntosh, who was with the Lower Towns, were opposed to each other during the conflict.\n\nChief McIntosh's first wife was Eliza Grierson. Eliza's parents were Robert Grierson, a Scottish trader, and a Creek woman named Sinnugee (a member of the Spanalgee Family). Married in 1800, McIntosh & Eliza's marriage produced three children. Their first-born was a son, named Chilly McIntosh (1804-1895) born near Coewta, Georgia. The couple also had two daughters, Jane McIntosh (ca. 1807-1868) and Catherine \"Kate\" McIntosh (1809-1849).\n\nIn 1811, McIntosh took a second wife, Susannah \"Su-gi\" Rowe, a full-blood Cherokee, daughter of Richard Roe and sister of Cherokee Nation District Judge David Rowe. Susannah Rowe is listed as both a Creek Old Settler and a Cherokee Nation Old Settler. Rebecca McIntosh (1815-1888) was one of her daughters and another was Delilah. William McIntosh and Susannah's son Daniel Newnan McIntosh, known as D.N., was born in 1822. As a highly successful soldier and businessman, McIntosh's elevated social/tribal status allowed him to take a third wife, a half-Creek/half-Cherokee woman named Peggy. Peggy would bear McIntosh three additional children, who were all still young at the time of McIntosh's death. Peggy reportedly lived on another property owned by her husband some 50 miles away and was not present when McIntosh died .\n\nFollowing his untimely death in 1825, all of McIntosh's children, except for daughter Kate, would eventually move out west in the late 1820s and early 1830s. Kate married a full-blooded Creek named William Cousins (1800-1876), the grandson of George Cousins (Chief of the Eufauli Tribe of Creek Indians), in Cusseta, Georgia in 1825. The young couple was following family westward to Oklahoma when a broken wagon wheel unexpectedly delayed their travels near Laurel Hill, Florida. The couple found their new surroundings very much to their liking and decided to stay, settling in modern-day Walton County, Florida. Once the rest of the McIntosh Family was settled in Oklahoma, Chilly and his younger half-brother D.N. McIntosh would both serve as officers with the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War with Chilly rising to the rank of Colonel.\n\nMcIntosh was a leader in adopting certain elements of European-American culture; he was interested in introducing US education among the Creek, adopted the use of chattel slavery on his plantations, and played a role in centralizing the Creek National Council over the years.\n\nHe used his influence to improve a Creek trail connecting the Upper and Lower Towns, that ran from Talladega, Alabama to the Chattahoochee River. He owned two plantations, \"Lockchau Talofau\" (\"Acorn Bluff\") in present-day Carroll County, and Indian Springs, in present-day Butts County. His plantation of Acorn Bluff was at the eastern terminus of the McIntosh Road, where the chief developed a ferry operation across the Chattahoochee River. He owned numerous black slaves to cultivate cotton as a commodity crop on his plantations. He also built a resort hotel at Indian Springs, hoping to attract more travelers along the improved road. Parts of this route are still referred to as the McIntosh Road, or the McIntosh Trail. It passes through several northern counties in Alabama and Georgia.\n\nThe Creek Nation struggled with internal tensions after the American Revolutionary War and during the War of 1812, when both Britain and the United States tried to engage them as allies. The Lower Towns, which comprised the majority of the population, were adapting some elements of European culture and lived more closely in relation to European Americans on the Georgia frontier. Many educated their children in English; some prominent Creek sent their sons to eastern universities for their education; and some adopted Christianity; as well as forms of European dress and houses - to show they were equally \"civilized\". They expanded their farms and some of the elite purchased chattel African slaves to work their plantations, as recommended by the British and Americans.\n\nInternal Creek tensions resulted in the Creek War (1813-1814), when tensions between the Lower Creek and the traditional Red Sticks of the Upper Towns erupted into open conflict. McIntosh and other Lower Creek allied with United States forces against the Red Sticks after 1813, during the War of 1812. The Red Sticks were allied with the British, as both wanted to limit American expansion in the Southeast. McIntosh fought in support of General Andrew Jackson and state militias in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, marking the defeat in 1814 of the Red Sticks and the end of the Creek War. He was made a brigadier general.\n\nThe Creek were forced to cede lands to the United States in the early 1800s. Maps mark the strips that were ceded over the years. McIntosh played a role in negotiations and cessions of 1805, 1814 (21 million acres after the Creek War), 1818 and 1821. For his role in completing the cession in 1821, US agents awarded McIntosh 1,000 acres of land at Indian Springs and 640 acres on the Ocmulgee River.\n\nAfter the wars, European-American settlers were increasingly migrating to the interior of the Southeast from the coastal areas and encroached on the territories of the Creek and other Southeastern tribes. Cultivation of short-staple cotton, which did well in these areas, was made profitable by Eli Whitney's invention of the cotton gin in the 1790s, which mechanized processing of the cotton. Lands were developed in the piedmont areas for large cotton plantations, stimulating a demand for African-American slaves that resulted in the forcible migration of more than one million slaves to the Deep South in the domestic trade.\n\nRemnants of Creek, other American Indian tribes, and fugitive slaves had migrated to Spanish Florida during the late 18th century, when they formed a new tribe, known as the Seminole. Georgia slaves escaped and took refuge in Spanish-held Florida, where the Spanish Crown offered them freedom and land, as Spain had come to control Florida once again at end the Revolutionary War, after a brief period of British rule.\n\nAfter the War of 1812, the British withdrew and turned over the fort that later became known as The Negro Fort on the lower Apalachicola River to newly freed African-Americans in the area. It was occupied by about 300 African-American men, women, and children, 20 renegade Choctaw, and a few Seminole warriors, led by an African-American former Colonial Marine named Garçon. Among the African-Americans were members of the disbanded British Corps of Colonial Marines. Georgia slaveholders and the U.S. Army called it the \"Negro Fort,\" and worried that the autonomy of the blacks would encourage their own slaves to escape or rebel. McIntosh fought with the United States in the First Seminole War and helped capture Fort Gadsden. When the Americans shot a heated cannonball into the fort, it struck the magazine and set off a huge explosion. Most of the people within the fort died immediately.\n\nMcIntosh was involved with chiefs from the Upper and Lower Towns (then primarily located in Alabama and Georgia, respectively) through the Creek National Council in developing a centralized government that borrowed from Anglo-American traditions. They formulated laws in the Code of 1818, which protected communal tribal property and established a police force known as the Law Defenders. In an effort to protect their remaining lands, the National Council, including McIntosh, had passed legislation in 1824 making it a capital crime to alienate communal land.\n\nLike other prominent chiefs, McIntosh worked closely with Benjamin Hawkins, the US Indian Supervisor in the Southeast for two decades until 1816. Hawkins was instrumental in gaining Creek cessions of land through that period, but he also supported McIntosh's efforts to bring European-American education to the territory by welcoming missionaries who set up schools.\n\nAfter President James Monroe came to office, in November 1817 his administration appointed David Brydie Mitchell as US Indian agent to the Creek. Mitchell had formerly been the governor of Georgia (1809-1813) (1815-1817), as well as holding other posts in the state. After the Creek War, the people suffered from the disruption. The US provided food and supplies as part of the annuities for the land cessions, especially the 21 million acres the Creek gave up following the war. Mitchell and McIntosh were suspected of controlling some of the distribution of food and annuities for their own benefit in this period, increasing McIntosh's power among the Creek.\n\nIn addition, Mitchell was implicated in the African importation case, in which illegal African slaves were held at the Creek agency on their sovereign land, for sale in the Mississippi Territory. This was tried in Admiralty Court as \"Miguel de Castro v. Ninety-five African Negros\" (1819-1820) because it was in violation of the US law, effective 1808, to end the international African slave trade.\n\nThe privateer \"Commodore\" Aury had taken the Africans as a prize from a Spanish ship bound for Havana, Cuba, where Spain continued slavery. He transported them to Amelia Island off Florida. William Bowen bought 110 slaves for $25,000 and had them taken to the Indian agency in the Creek Nation in two batches: in December 1817 and January 1818. Mitchell appeared to be primarily responsible for keeping the Africans at the Creek agency, which was considered outside US territory as it was within the Creek Nation. This was prior to the expected sale of the slaves in the Mississippi Territory, then including Alabama. Too many people learned about the presence of the Africans, and Mitchell was prosecuted over the issue.\n\nPresident Monroe replaced Mitchell in 1821 with John Crowell, who had previously served as a US Congressman from Alabama. That year, the Creek agreed to another land cession in order to raise money for needed food and supplies, as conditions were still difficult for them.\n\nUnder pressure from the United States and the state of Georgia, McIntosh and some Creek chiefs had ceded land in 1821. The National Creek Council at that time considered execution of McIntosh for this breach of the Law to protect the communal lands but did not proceed. The United States' growing European population, particularly in the Northeast, put pressure on the federal government to take more Indian land. The federal government continued to try to persuade or force the Creek and other Southeastern tribes to cede the remainder of their lands in exchange for payments and land west of the Mississippi River, in what was called Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma and Arkansas.)\n\nOn February 12, 1825, McIntosh and eight other chiefs signed the Treaty of Indian Springs. These chiefs included Samuel and Benjamin Hawkins, mixed-race Creek sons of Stephen Hawkins, who was also of mixed race. The brothers had both been educated at Princeton. Samuel had married McIntosh's daughter Jane, and Benjamin would later marry his daughter Rebecca.\n\nThe treaty ceded all the remaining Creek land in Georgia (the Upper and Lower Towns) to the United States in exchange for $200,000 and annuities to be paid to the Creek nation. Another $200,000 was paid directly to McIntosh. The fifth article of the treaty stipulated that McIntosh receive payment for lands he was previously granted in 1821. Historians continue to argue over whether McIntosh ceded the land for personal gain, or because he believed removal was inevitable, and he was trying to achieve some security for the Creek Nation. Historians such as Michael Green believed that McIntosh was selling away the tribe's birthright and future; he described the treaty as\n\nFraudulent by the standards of any society, concluded in violation of the expressed orders of both interested governments, riddled with bribery, chicanery and deceit, the treaty illegally acquired for Georgia and Alabama, through the offices of the United States, an enormous amount of land.\n\nAs soon as the Creek National Council learned of this, they protested to Washington, but the Senate had already ratified the treaty. Initially Washington officials tried to carry it out. Governor George Troup of Georgia, a cousin of McIntosh, had promised him protection but put pressure on him to survey lands ahead of time, as Georgia wanted to prepare for a land lottery. Under the treaty the Creek had until late 1826 to leave the ceded territory.\n\nUnder its Code of 1818, the National Council had established a police force, known as Law Menders. The Council ruled that the signatories of the 1825 treaty had to be executed for ceding the communal land, which was defined as a capital crime. This was the first known occasion when the Council ordered execution of men for a crime against the centralized Nation. The Council assigned chief Menawa, of a ceded township in the Upper Towns, to carry out the sentence.\n\nOn April 30, 1825, the Red Stick leader \"Menawa,\" with a large force of 120-150 Law Menders (the recently organized Creek police force) from towns in the ceded territory, attacked the McIntosh plantation, lighting bonfires around the buildings. Then they set McIntosh's house on fire. McIntosh, wounded by gunfire, was pulled from the burning house by several attackers, then one of the men stabbed him in the heart. Other Creeks shot him more than fifty times. Chillie McIntosh, the chief's oldest son, had also been sentenced to die, but he escaped by diving through a window. \"Etommee Tustunnuggee,\" another Creek chief who signed the 1825 treaty, was killed during the raid. Later that day, the Law Menders found the Hawkins brothers, who were also signatories; they hanged Samuel and shot Benjamin, but he escaped. The Creek had \"adopted certain Anglo-American legal concepts, ... welded them to their own concepts of political independence and used them to serve decidedly Creek purposes.\"\n\nWilliam McIntosh's wives asked for a suit of clothes for his burial, but the assassins insisted on throwing the naked corpse into an unmarked grave. His burial site and part of his plantation have been preserved as the McIntosh Reserve in Carroll County, Georgia. According to Meserve, the grave is near Whitesburg.\n\nMembers of the National Council, including Menawa, went to Washington to protest the 1825 treaty. The U.S. government rejected the 1825 treaty as fraudulent, and negotiated the 1826 Treaty of Washington, which allowed the Creek to keep about in Alabama. In this new treaty, the Creek received an immediate payment of $217,660 and a perpetual annuities of $20,000. The state of Georgia ignored the new treaty and worked to evict the Creek from their lands before official removal started in the 1830s.\n\nAfter William's death, his half-brother Roley McIntosh advanced to serve as chief of the Lower Creeks until 1859, moving with them to Indian Territory in the 1830s. His first wife had died and the widower married Susannah, the widow McIntosh.\n\nLed by his son Chilly, McIntosh's family and other Creek moved to Indian Territory in 1828, where they settled at the forks of the Arkansas, Verdigris and Grand (Neosho) rivers, setting up the Western Creek Nation. His two sons Chillicothe and D.N. McIntosh both served as Confederate officers in the Civil War. D. N. McIntosh was commissioned as a colonel. He founded the 1st Creek Mounted Volunteers (later known as the First Creek Cavalry Regiment, C.S.A.); Chilly founded the 2nd Creek Mounted Volunteers (later known as the Second Creek Cavalry Regiment, CSA). Both brothers later became Baptist ministers in the Indian Territory. Eight McIntosh men served with the Confederate Army during the war.\n\nRebecca McIntosh married Benjamin Hawkins in the Western Creek Nation in 1831. Benjamin knew Sam Houston, and in 1833 he and Rebecca moved to Marion County, Texas on the territory's eastern border, where they developed the Refuge plantation. Their son William died young, and they had two daughters, Louisa and Anna. Benjamin Hawkins died in 1836 in Texas, killed near Nagodoches.\nBy the 1840s, Rebecca's sisters Delilah McIntosh, who married William Drew, and Catherine Hettie McIntosh, who married James D. Willison, were settled in Texas with their husbands and families on part of the Hawkins property. Delilah and William Drew's 2400-acre plantation, called Falonah, was near the Refuge.\n\nThe widow Rebecca McIntosh Hawkins married Spire M. Hagerty, who held land and slaves on his Phoenix plantation in Harrison County, Texas. He died in December 1849 in Montgomery County, Alabama. By 1860, Rebecca Hagerty was the richest woman in Texas at the age of 45. She was the only woman who in 1860 owned more than 100 slaves, and likely the only Native American in Texas to do so. She owned three plantations: the third was in Cass County, and the total properties amounted to 12,800 acres. In 1860, her \"personal wealth was reported to have been $85,000 and her real estate valued at $35,000. She was the wealthiest person in Marion County, where her plantation Refuge was located. Most of her personal wealth was attributed to the value of the one hundred and two people she held in bondage.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
