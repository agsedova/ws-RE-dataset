She then worked as a paralegal.\n\nMulligan first ran for the Illinois House of Representatives in 1990, eventually losing the Republican primary to conservative incumbent Penny Pullen by six votes. After the first count, she was actually named the winner by 11 votes. The courts then ordered a recount that left the vote tied, and so a coin toss was used to break the tie. Mulligan won the coin toss. Pullen then appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court, which did its own recount that left Pullen the winner.\n\nIn 1992, Mulligan ran again and won On January 12, 2011 Rep. Mulligan was sworn in for her tenth (and ultimately final) term as state representative. During her 20 year tenure in the Illinois House, she became a leader on state budget issues (particularly human service appropriations), family issues, health care, and early childhood education.\n\nShe was recognized for her expertise in prescription drugs, problem and compulsive gambling, health insurance coverage and reforms, welfare to work and victims' rights. She served as majority chair or minority spokesman of the Illinois House Human Services Appropriations Committee for 10 years. She received numerous awards and honors and was named \"One of the Top 100 Women Making a Difference\" by \"Today's Chicago Woman.\"\n\nIn the fall of 2009 Mulligan announced her intention to run for Republican Committeeman of Maine Township Maine Township, Cook County, Illinois against incumbent Mark Thompson. Mulligan gained the support and endorsement of almost all locally elected Republican officials in the Maine Township area.

She did not seek re-election.\n\nMulligan stated that she hoped to bring \"unity and organization\" back to the Republican Party in Maine Township, something she believes was lacking during Thompson's tenure. She also planned to reinstate many of the precinct captains Thompson let go in recent years and \"build bridges\" with local Republicans who have not been involved with the organization for some time.\"\n\nFollowing redistricting, Mulligan opted to seek election in the 55th District, but failed to make the ballot after collecting below the minimum threshold required number of voter signatures.

{"id": "2270205", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270205", "title": "Viridiana", "text": "Viridiana\n\nViridiana () is a 1961 Spanish-Mexican film directed by Luis Buñuel and produced by Gustavo Alatriste. It is loosely based on the 1895 novel \"Halma\" by Benito Pérez Galdós.\n\n\"Viridiana\" was the co-winner of the \"Palme d'Or\" at the 1961 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nA novice named Viridiana (Silvia Pinal) is about to take her vows when her only living relative, her uncle Don Jaime (Fernando Rey), invites her to visit him. She has met him only once, and is reluctant to comply. Her mother superior pressures her to accept.\n\nDon Jaime is a recluse living on a neglected farm with a few servants: Ramona (Margarita Lozano), her daughter Rita, and Moncho. When Don Jaime sees his niece, he is struck by her strong resemblance to his deceased wife.\n\nOn her last night Viridiana, grateful for her uncle's longtime financial support, reluctantly complies with his odd request for her to don his wife's wedding gown. When Ramona informs her that Don Jaime wants to marry her, she's aghast, and her uncle seems to drop the idea. Ramona secretly drugs Viridiana's drink and Don Jaime carries the unconscious girl to her room intending to rape her, but at the last minute he stops. However, the next morning he lies and tells her that he \"took her virginity\", so she cannot return to her convent. When she insists that she must go back, he confesses that he lied, leaving her uncertain about what had happened.\n\nAt the bus stop, the authorities prevent her from leaving. Her uncle has hanged himself, leaving his property to her and his illegitimate son Jorge (Francisco Rabal). Deeply disturbed, Viridiana decides not to return to the convent. Instead, she collects some beggars and installs them in an outbuilding. She devotes herself to feeding and morally educating them. Disgusted, Moncho departs. Jorge moves into the house with his girlfriend Lucia and starts to renovate the rundown place. Lucia, sensing that he lusts after Viridiana like his father did, leaves. Jorge then makes a pass at the willing Ramona.\n\nWhen Viridiana and Jorge leave for a few days to take care of some business, the paupers break into the house. At first, they just want to look around, but faced with such bounty, they degenerate into a drunken, riotous bunch and party to the strains of Handel's \"Messiah\". The beggars pose around the table for a photo in which they resemble the figures in Da Vinci's \"Last Supper\".\n\nThe rightful owners return earlier than expected and find the house in shambles. The miscreants excuse themselves one by one and leave. Jorge confronts one of them, who pulls a knife. Another beggar strikes his head with a bottle, knocking him out. Viridiana enters the room and hastens to help Jorge who is lying on the floor. The first man grabs her. As Viridiana resists sexual assault, Jorge regains consciousness. He has been tied up, but manages to bribe one beggar to kill the would-be rapist. The police finally arrive.\n\nViridiana is a changed woman and young Rita burns her crown of thorns. Wearing her hair loosely, Viridiana knocks on Jorge's door, but finds Ramona with him in his bedroom. As Ashley Beaumont sings \"Shimmy Doll\" on the record player, Jorge tells Viridiana that they were only playing cards and urges her to join them: \"You know, the first time I saw you, I thought, my cousin and I will end up shuffling the deck together.\"\n\nThe Spanish board of censors rejected the original ending of the film, which depicted Viridiana entering her cousin's room and slowly closing the door behind her. Consequently, a new ending was written; this turned out to be more suggestive than the first, because it implied a \"ménage à trois\" between Ramona, Jorge, and Viridiana.\n\n\nToday \"Viridiana\" is regarded by many critics as a masterpiece; reception was not, however, as adamantly positive on initial release. After the film was completed and sent by the Spanish cinematographic authority to the Cannes Film Festival, and awarded, the government of Francisco Franco tried unsuccessfully to have the film withdrawn and banned its release in Spain. \"L'Osservatore Romano\", the official newspaper of the Vatican, described the film as \"blasphemous\". The film was released there in 1977, after Franco's death, when Buñuel was 77 years old. However, the film was acclaimed at Cannes, winning the Palme d'Or. Buñuel later said that \"I didn't deliberately set out to be blasphemous, but then Pope John XXIII is a better judge of such things than I am\".\n\nNot all critics of the day were in awe of it. Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" wrote:\n\nThe film was released by the Criterion Collection in the United States, on the Directors Suite label in Australia, and by Madman Entertainment in New Zealand. It won the Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association.\n\n\"Viridiana\" was voted the 37th greatest film of all time in the directors' poll of the British Film Institute's 2012 \"Sight & Sound\" issue.\n\n"}
{"id": "2270207", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270207", "title": "WBIR-TV", "text": "WBIR-TV\n\nWBIR-TV, virtual and VHF digital channel 10, is an NBC-affiliated television station licensed to Knoxville, Tennessee, United States. The station is owned by Tegna Inc. WBIR-TV's studios are located on Bill Williams Avenue in Knoxville's Belle Morris section, and its transmitter is located on Sharp's Ridge in North Knoxville.\n\nOn cable, the station is available on Charter Spectrum channel 9 in SD and 709 in HD, as well as Comcast Xfinity channels 9 and 1010, WOW! channels 9 and 903, and AT&T U-Verse channels 10 and 1010. \n\nWBIR-TV signed on the air on August 12, 1956, as a CBS affiliate, taking that affiliation away from WTVK (channel 26, now WVLT-TV on channel 8). During the late 1950s, the station was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network. WBIR-TV was originally owned by a consortium headed by J. Lindsay Nunn and his son, Gilmore Nunn, owners of WBIR radio (1240 AM, now WIFA; and FM 103.5, now WIMZ-FM). The station's call letters come from Jesse W. \"Jay\" Birdwell, who founded WBIR radio in 1941; Birdwell sold the station to the Nunns in 1944. The Nunns shared ownership with WBIR general manager John P. Hart; Knoxville residents Robert and Martha Ashe, and the Taft family of Cincinnati. In October 1959 the Tafts' broadcast subsidiary, Radio Cincinnati, Inc. (later known as Taft Broadcasting), purchased the remaining 70 percent of the WBIR stations outright from the other parties.\n\nIn January 1961, Radio Cincinnati, Inc. sold WBIR-AM-FM-TV to the News-Piedmont Company of Greenville, South Carolina, owner of WFBC-AM-FM-TV in its home city. In 1967, News-Piedmont merged with Southern Broadcasting to form the Southeastern Broadcasting Corporation. Soon afterward, Southeastern sold off most of its radio stations (including WBIR-AM-FM), purchased four more television stations and changed its name to Multimedia, Inc. WBIR shared flagship status with WFBC-TV (now WYFF).\n\nOn September 10, 1988, WBIR became an NBC affiliate, swapping affiliations with WTVK just before it moved to channel 8 as WKXT-TV in December. Ironically, this marked CBS' return to its original affiliate in Knoxville. At the time, NBC was the top-rated network while CBS was in third place near the midpoint of the Laurence Tisch period of that network's history. NBC was more than willing to make the switch, since WTVK had been one of its weakest affiliates while WBIR was a solid runner-up to WATE-TV; WTVK would move to channel 8 not too long afterwards on December 1 and become WKXT. With the switch, channel 10 became the last major commercial station in Knoxville to change affiliations. The switch also made channel 10 the third station in Knoxville to carry NBC; the network had previously aired on WATE from 1953 to 1979 before moving to WTVK in 1979. Multimedia merged with Gannett in 1995.\n\nFor a time in the 1980s, WBIR was seen on several ten-watt translators across East Tennessee and Virginia. One of them, W04BM, was licensed to LaFollette, Tennessee and operated on channel 4.\n\nIn 2008, WBIR-TV debuted new graphics and news music. On June 1, 2011, WBIR-TV and Fox affiliate WTNZ-TV, for whom WBIR-TV was producing a 10 p.m. newscast, debuted a new high-definition news set and weather studio and a full makeover of branding. However, WBIR-TV retained their logo by adding the HD symbol to the right of the logo.\n\nAround the first week of October 2012, Gannett entered a dispute against Dish Network regarding compensation fees and Dish's AutoHop commercial-skip feature on its Hopper digital video recorders. Gannett ordered that Dish discontinue AutoHop on the account that it is affecting advertising revenues for WBIR. Gannett threatened to pull WBIR from Dish should the skirmish continue beyond October 7 and Dish and Gannett fail to reach an agreement (WTNZ was not involved in the dispute, as the station is owned by Raycom Media, rather than by Gannett, which continues to produce its newscasts via WBIR). The two parties eventually reached an agreement after extending the deadline for a few hours.\n\nOn June 29, 2015, the Gannett Company split in two, with one side specializing in print media and the other side specializing in broadcast and digital media. WBIR was retained by the latter company, named Tegna.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nThe national NBC Weather Plus network is defunct as of December 1, 2008, and was revamped as an affiliate of NBC Plus, utilizing the same graphics as Weather Plus (and is now a computer-updated loop of regional satellite/radar images, current temperatures, and daily forecasts) and without the national on-camera meteorologist segments (though the local OCM segments remained). In late 2011, it was replaced with The Local AccuWeather Channel, branded as \"10 Weather Now\". On October 8, 2012, it was replaced with MeTV. In early 2015, WBIR added a third digital channel (channel 10.3), which currently broadcasts the Justice Network.\n\nWBIR-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 10, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 31 to VHF channel 10.\n\nSyndicated programming on WBIR-TV includes \"Dr. Phil\", \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\", \"Wheel of Fortune\", and \"Jeopardy!\".\n\n\"The Heartland Series\", hosted by Bill Landry, was a popular documentary series produced by WBIR from 1984 until 2009. It was conceived in 1984 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. It continued to celebrate the people and the land of the entire Appalachian region, presenting re-enactments of historic events and feature stories about regional culture. In February 2009, WBIR announced that it would suspend production of the series in September 2009, but would continue to show the hundreds of episodes already produced \"for as long as the viewers like them.\" The last episode was taped at the Museum of Appalachia in Norris on August 8, 2009 before an audience estimated at 10,000 people, one of the largest crowds in the museum's history.\n\nDuring its 25-year history, \"The Heartland Series\" received several awards, including four Emmy Awards. U.S. embassies around the world keep tapes of \"The Heartland Series\" broadcasts as an information resource on life in Appalachia.\n\nIn 2006, WBIR celebrated its 50th anniversary with a special report on some of the past stories captured on WBIR for the past 50 years. These reports were called \"Our Stories\" and included retrospectives on events such as U.S. Presidents visiting Knoxville and East Tennessee, major crimes and even the 25th Anniversary of the 1982 World's Fair.\n\nWBIR co-produces a yearly telethon with Asheville, North Carolina ABC affiliate WLOS, benefiting Friends of the Smokies and Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The proceeds from the telethon help support critical programs and projects in the park. It is co-hosted by WBIR Anchor Emeritus Bill Williams and WLOS anchor Larry Blunt.\n\nWBIR has been the market leader in East Tennessee for more than 30 years. Specifically, the morning and 6 p.m. newscasts normally get better ratings than WATE and WVLT's newscasts combined. Currently, WBIR has the largest news team in East Tennessee and produces the most news programming in the area.\n\nPrior to September 15, 2008, this show was aired at 5 p.m. on weekdays under the title \"LIVE at Five.\" The program focused on community events and celebrity interviews. In 2008, the show was moved to 4 p.m. and was temporarily renamed \"LIVE at Five at Four\" with WBIR asking for viewers' opinions on a new name. The quirky temporary name, however, was embraced by viewers and \"LIVE at Five at Four\" has remained the brand for the 4 p.m. program. In 2010, \"LIVE at Five at Four\" debuted new graphics to better reflect programming shown on the newscast.\n\nUntil late March 2011, WBIR-TV produced a 10 p.m. newscast for CW affiliate WBXX-TV. On March 28, WBIR-TV began producing a nightly 10 p.m. newscast for Fox affiliate WTNZ (channel 43). WBIR also begin producing a weekday morning news show at 7 a.m. that begin in June 2012 for that station. Both stations' newscasts began airing in high definition on June 1, 2011, making WBIR and WTNZ the second and third stations in Knoxville to make the upgrade.\n\nOn October 28, 2013, WBIR expanded its noon newscast from 25 minutes to a full hour.\n\nWBIR is carried on cable television systems in southeast Kentucky, including Community Telecom Services in the Monticello area of Wayne County, Kentucky. The station is also available on Zito Media Cable systems in Knox and Whitley counties. WBIR-TV is the only Knoxville-based broadcast outlet available on Charter Spectrum systems in the Somerset/Pulaski County area.\n\n"}
{"id": "2270210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270210", "title": "Characters of Final Fantasy VIII", "text": "Characters of Final Fantasy VIII\n\n\"Final Fantasy VIII\", a 1999 best-selling role-playing video game by Squaresoft, features an elite group of mercenaries called \"SeeD\", as well as soldiers, rebels, and political leaders of various nations and cities. Thirteen weeks after its release, \"Final Fantasy VIII\" had earned more than US$50 million in sales, making it the fastest selling \"Final Fantasy\" title at the time. The game has shipped 8.15 million units worldwide as of March 2003. Additionally, \"Final Fantasy VIII\" was voted the 22nd-best game of all time by readers of the Japanese magazine \"Famitsu\" in 2006. The game's characters were created by Tetsuya Nomura, and are the first in the series to be realistically proportioned in all aspects of the game. This graphical shift, as well as the cast itself, has received generally positive reviews from gaming magazines and websites.\n\nThe six main playable characters in \"Final Fantasy VIII\" are Squall Leonhart, a loner who avoids vulnerability by focusing on his duty; Rinoa Heartilly, an outspoken and passionate young woman who follows her heart; Quistis Trepe, an instructor with a serious yet patient attitude; Zell Dincht, an energetic martial artist with a fondness for hot dogs; Selphie Tilmitt, a cheerful girl who loves trains and flies the airship Ragnarok; and Irvine Kinneas, a marksman and womanizer who uses his charm to mask his insecurities. Temporarily playable characters include Laguna Loire, Kiros Seagill, and Ward Zabac, who appear in \"flashback\" sequences; SeeD cadet-turned-antagonist Seifer Almasy; and sorceress Edea Kramer. The main antagonist is Ultimecia, a sorceress from the future who wishes to compress time.\n\nIn \"Final Fantasy\" games, scenario writer Kazushige Nojima stresses the dynamic of the relationship between the player and the main character; thus, he puts significant thought into how that relationship will develop. With \"Final Fantasy VII\", protagonist Cloud Strife's reserved nature led Nojima to include scenarios in which the player can select Cloud's responses to certain situations and dialogue. With \"Final Fantasy VIII\", which also features a reserved lead protagonist in Squall, Nojima wanted to give players actual insight into what the protagonist is thinking, even while other characters remain uninformed: this led to the inner dialogues Squall has throughout the game.\n\nCharacter designer Tetsuya Nomura, while exchanging e-mails with director Yoshinori Kitase between development of \"Final Fantasy VII\" and \"Final Fantasy VIII\", suggested that the game should have a \"school days\" feel. Nojima approved of the idea, as he already had a story in mind in which the main characters were the same age. Thus, they created the concept of military academies, called \"Gardens\", in which students would train to become \"SeeD\" mercenaries. Nojima also planned for the two playable parties featured in the game—Squall's present day group and Laguna Loire's group from twenty years in the past—to highly contrast with. Laguna's group consists of a close-knit group of battle-hardened friends in their late twenties. On the other hand, Squall's party is young and inexperienced, and Squall himself does not initially understand the value of friendship.\n\nKitase desired to give the game a foreign atmosphere (\"foreign\" being in relation to Japan), ultimately deciding on a European setting. The first character Nomura designed specifically for \"Final Fantasy VIII\" was Squall, initially giving him longer hair and a more feminine appearance. However, Kitase was unsatisfied and asked Nomura to shorten his hair and make him appear more masculine, which led to the design seen in-game. When designing Cloud, Nomura gave him distinctly spiky, bright blonde hair to emphasize his role as that game's protagonist. With Squall, Nomura wanted to try a unique angle to establish his role, giving him the characteristic gunblade scar across the bridge of his nose. A complete history was not yet conceived, so Nomura left the explanation for Squall's scar to Nojima. Squall's design was flourished by a fur lining along the collar of his jacket, included for the purpose of challenging the game's full motion video designers, who were also developing the CGI film \"\" at the time. This is but one example of the demands he has consistently extended to the programmers of the series as technology has advanced.\n\nMost \"Final Fantasy\" games include summons: creatures who are brought into battle to attack enemies or support the party. In \"Final Fantasy VIII\", summons are called \"Guardian Forces\", or GFs. Nomura felt they should be unique beings, without clothes or other human-like concepts. This was problematic, as he did not want them to \"become [like] the actual monsters\", so he took great care in their design. Ramuh—an old wizard summon from earlier \"Final Fantasy\" games—was replaced; other human-like designs were re-imagined as nude figures or with creature-like elements. Nomura, also the director of the Guardian Force animation sequences, wanted to create a greater impact than the summon cinematics of \"Final Fantasy VII\". Leviathan was created as a test and included in a game demo. Garnering a positive reaction from players, Nomura decided to create the remaining sequences in a similar fashion.\n\nIn a \"Famitsu Weekly\" interview with Kitase, Nomura, and Yuusuke Naoi, the team agreed that \"Final Fantasy VIII\" reflects Nomura's preferred technique, as opposed to \"Final Fantasy VII\", which featured characters that \"weren't really his style\". The team also decided to use realistically proportioned characters. The higher level of full motion video technology would have otherwise created an inconsistency between the in-game graphics and the higher definition full motion video graphics. Additionally, Kitase explained that the main logo of the game—Squall and Rinoa embracing—was inspired by the team's efforts to express emotion through body language.\n\nThe world of \"Final Fantasy VIII\" is predominantly occupied by humans. Another prominent race is the \"Shumi\", a small tribe of creatures with yellow skin and large arms. The tribe lives in an underground village on the Trabian continent. The Shumi frown upon showing off their large hands; NORG, the owner of Balamb Garden, was exiled from the tribe for his ostentation. All Shumi undergo a biological metamorphosis at some point in their lives; a qualified Shumi will become an Elder while another may become a mute \"Moomba\". Moombas are covered in red fur, which the Shumi attribute to \"the passionate ingenuity in their hearts\". Additionally, Moombas have appeared in several \"Final Fantasy\" spin-offs, including \"Chocobo World\" and \"Chocobo Racing\".\n\nChocobos—large galliform birds common throughout the \"Final Fantasy\" series—are featured in the game. In this title, Chocobos are generally undomesticated and can be found in various forests throughout the world. Each forest has a minigame where the player must corral baby Chocobos to locate the mother. If the player catches a bird, a baby Chocobo (a Chicobo) named Boko will follow the player around. Boko has his own game called \"Chocobo World\" that can be downloaded from the PlayStation disc onto a PocketStation game unit. Series composer Nobuo Uematsu created two Chocobo themes for \"Final Fantasy VIII\": \"Mods de Chocobo\" and \"Odeka de Chocobo\".\n\n\"Final Fantasy VIII\" also features an array of common real world creatures, such as cats and dogs. The game also includes numerous monsters, many of which have appeared earlier in the series. Popular recurring monsters include Adamantoise, Behemoth, Bomb, Cactuar, Iron Giant, Malboro, and Tonberry.\n\n is the main protagonist of \"Final Fantasy VIII\". He is a young student at Balamb Garden who is identifiable by the scar on his face that a fellow student, Seifer, inflicted. He rarely speaks and has the reputation of being a lone wolf. As Squall's story unfolds, he becomes fascinated with and falls in love with Rinoa, despite never outwardly expressing such until the ending. Squall is characterized by forlorn memories of standing out in the rain at the orphanage where he grew up, wondering where \"Sis\" went. Squall's weapon is a gunblade, a sword that uses components of a revolver to send vibrations through the blade when triggered. His Limit Break is a series of sword strikes called \"Renzokuken\".\n\n is the primary female protagonist of \"Final Fantasy VIII\". She is the 17-year-old daughter of General Caraway, a high-ranking officer in the Galbadian army, and Julia Heartilly, a successful pianist and singer. Rinoa is a member of the Forest Owls, a resistance faction seeking to liberate the small nation of Timber from Galbadian occupation. When Squall and his party of SeeD help the resistance movement fight Galbadia, Rinoa decides to stay with them; as a result she ends up falling in love with Squall. She has black hair with brown highlights and dark eyes. Outspoken, spirited, emotional, and honest with her feelings, she speaks her mind without reservation. Because of her ambition, she can often be stubborn. \n\nIn battle, she uses a weapon called a \"Blaster Edge\", which consists of an arm holster and a projectile that returns like a boomerang. In her \"Combine\" Limit Break, she attacks in unison with her dog, Angelo. When Rinoa gains Sorceress powers, she acquires a second Limit Break, \"Angel Wing\", which increases her spell-casting ability, along with rendering her in a state of \"magic\" berserk for the remainder of the battle.\n\n is a man whose past and relation to the main characters are revealed slowly throughout the game. Most of the sequences involving Laguna appear in the form of \"dreams\" experienced by the primary protagonists. Squall always experiences these dreams from Laguna's point of view, although he does not think too highly of Laguna. Laguna attacks with a Machine gun and his Limit Break is \"Desperado\", which involves a swinging rope, a grenade, and a barrage of bullets. During the dream segments, he is a twenty-seven-year-old soldier in the Galbadian army who travels with his companions, Kiros Seagill and Ward Zabac. He is also an aspiring journalist.\n\nDuring the first two dream segments, Laguna and his team are shown getting lost and visiting the hotel where singer Julia Heartilly, Laguna's romantic interest, performs. After a scouting mission at Centra, the three soldiers are separated and Laguna is injured. A young woman named Raine nurses him back to health after he is brought to Winhill. He falls in love with and marries her. However, he is drawn away from his new home when a young girl in their care, Ellone, is kidnapped. Laguna tracks her down in Esthar, where he helps liberate the nation from the despotic rule of Sorceress Adel. The people of Esthar elect Laguna as their president and Ellone is sent back to Winhill without him. After Raine dies, her child (whom Ward and Kiros imply to be Squall in a conversation aboard the \"Ragnarok\") and Ellone are sent to an orphanage. Laguna is unable to leave his post to visit her and remains president of Esthar to the present day. Ellone and Laguna are reunited in space, and Laguna helps the party prepare for their fight against Ultimecia.\n\nThe concept of two main characters was planned since the beginning of the game's development. Nomura tried to create a contrast between Laguna's and Squall's occupations; thus, Laguna became a soldier with a light-hearted charisma, and Squall became a reserved mercenary student. The designers intended Laguna to be more similar to the previous protagonists in the series to complement Squall, who is different from previous main characters. Laguna is ranked seventh in \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"'s list of the top ten video game politicians.\n\nLaguna Loire appears in \"Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy\", where he is voiced by Hiroaki Hirata in the Japanese version and Armando Valdes-Kennedy in the English version. He is featured in his youthful \"Final Fantasy VIII\" appearance while his older and his Galbadian soldier forms. His costume of a knight is also available as downloadable content. Laguna was also planned to appear in \"Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep\" as the head of Mirage Arena.\n\n is a classmate and rival of Squall, who can only be controlled by the player during the Dollet sequence. He reappears as a boss later in the game. He acts as a foil to Squall in many respects, having dated Rinoa before she met Squall,and assuming a leadership position among his friends. Like Squall, Seifer wields a gunblade which he calls \"Hyperion\". His Limit Break, \"Fire Cross\", allows him to use an attack called \"No Mercy\". He later uses the more powerful techniques \"Demon Slice\" and \"Bloodfest\" against the player. Seifer has a short temper and is often depicted as a bully who desires attention. He is also fiercely independent and is often punished for his recklessness. He is the leader of Balamb Garden's disciplinary committee with his friends Fujin and Raijin. After joining Ultimecia, he becomes the leader of the Galbadian army.\n\nDuring the introduction sequence, Seifer cuts Squall across the left side of his face with his gunblade, leaving a scar. Squall retaliates with a backhand slash that leaves Seifer with a mirrored scar. At the following field exam in Dollet, Seifer acts independently from his teammates Squall and Zell, abandoning them; consequently, he fails and is not promoted to SeeD. Spurred by dreams of a brighter future, he defects to Sorceress Edea so he could be her \"knight\". From his point of view, Squall and the others are \"evil\" and he recognizes himself as a hero. As Seifer is brainwashed by the sorceress, he alienates himself from his friends. Eventually, Fujin and Raijin abandon him and he is defeated shortly afterward. Following Edea's defeat, the party confronts Seifer one last time as he now serves Ultimecia, and either they or Gilgamesh defeat him. Seifer escapes, kidnapping Rinoa and bringing her to Adel. At the end of the game, Seifer is seen fishing and having fun with Fujin and Raijin.\n\nNomura had originally intended Seifer not only as Squall's rival, but also as part of the love triangle between him, Squall, and Rinoa. Although this concept was shelved in the final script, Seifer remains Squall's rival and his appearance was designed to contrast with Squall's. They have equivalent but mirrored scars on their faces and their jackets are of opposing color and length. Both characters use gunblades; Squall's gunblade is larger and requires two hands, while Seifer's gunblade is lighter and can be wielded with one hand. A younger version of Seifer makes an appearance in \"Kingdom Hearts II\" as a member of the Twilight Town Disciplinary Committee with Fujin and Raijin. Seifer in the virtual Twilight Town is a rival of the main character, Roxas, and at one point mentions that he does not wish to cooperate with destiny. He is voiced by Takehito Koyasu and Will Friedle in the Japanese and English versions, respectively. He is also featured in the rhythm game \"Theatrhythm Final Fantasy\" as a subcharacter representing \"Final Fantasy VIII\".\n\nThe book \"Converging Traditions in the Digital Moving Image: Architectures of Illusion, Images of Truth\" discusses that while Seifer is seen as a show-off and a troublemaker, protagonist Squall Leonhart identifies with him. IGN listed Seifer as the 91st best video game villain, stating that he makes for a great rival due to the similarities between him and Squall.\n\n is an eighteen-year-old instructor at Balamb Garden, where Squall, Zell, and Seifer are students. She uses a chain whip in battle, and her Limit Break, \"Blue Magic\", a common ability found throughout the \"Final Fantasy\" games, allows her to imitate monsters' attacks. Early in the game, Quistis is discharged as an instructor because she \"[lacks] leadership qualities\". Afterwards, she maintains a more informal relationship with the other characters as a fellow member of SeeD.\n\nAs a child, Quistis stayed at an orphanage with most of the main characters. She then lived with foster parents, with whom she never developed any intimacy, before moving to Balamb Garden at age ten. She became a SeeD at fifteen and an instructor two years later. By this time, she has become very popular, having a number of fans who identify themselves as \"Trepies\". For her part, Quistis never shows any indication of being aware of their existence. Quistis initially joins Squall to prepare him for his upcoming field exam. She later takes Squall into her confidence and tells him personally about her demotion. Squall rudely tells her to go \"talk to a wall\", a famous comical line in the game, and not to burden him with her problems. This furthers the player's perception of Squall's awkwardness and anti-social tendencies. When Irvine refreshes the main characters' memories about the orphanage, they remember that Squall's asocial behavior began when Ellone, an older sister figure to Squall, left the orphanage unexpectedly. As a result of these revelations, Quistis recognizes that her feelings for Squall are more sisterly than romantic. Later, she criticizes Squall when he nearly abandons Rinoa, his romantic interest.\n\nWhen designing the characters, Nomura had wanted at least one female character to wear a skirt. Quistis was originally supposed to fill this part, but Nomura decided a long skirt worn over pants would look better. The role was eventually passed to Selphie. Nomura was surprised when the writers cast her as a teacher, despite being around the same age as the rest of the group.\n\nQuistis also appears in \"World of Final Fantasy\" where she is voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro in Japanese and Kristina Pesic in English.\n\n is a student at Balamb Garden who recently transferred from Trabia Garden. She is active and energetic, although slightly clumsy. She participates in many extracurricular activities, such as planning the Garden Festival and running the school's website. She wields nunchaku in battle, and her Limit Break \"Slot\" allows the player to cast a random spell numerous times as well as certain magic used exclusively in her limit break. In addition to battle, she pilots the Ragnarok starship.\n\nSelphie first appears when running into Squall while late for class. She asks Squall to show her around because she recently transferred. During the Dollet exam, Selphie joins Squall's team after Seifer abandons them. She becomes a SeeD with Squall and Zell, and the three are assigned to the same team. When Galbadia launches missiles at Trabia Garden, she reacts with outrage and helps destroy the missile base. Throughout the game, she revisits her childhood closeness with Irvine, who serves as her copilot on the Ragnarok.\n\nSelphie was the second character that Nomura drew, after Squall, intentionally giving her an impractical hairstyle. When he first designed Selphie, Nomura drew her in overalls; however, he realized that none of the characters would be wearing a skirt. In the end, he gave Selphie a mini-skirt and let Quistis have pants. In the \"Kingdom Hearts\" series, Nomura included a younger version of Selphie as a resident of Destiny Islands, and uses a jump rope instead of nunchaku. She is voiced by Mayuko Aoki in the Japanese version, and by Molly Marlette in the English version.\n\n is a student at Balamb Garden with Squall and Seifer. Seventeen years old, Zell is a martial artist who fits the role of unarmed character, just like Tifa Lockhart did in the previous game, \"Final Fantasy VII\". Zell attacks with punches and kicks, his weapons being gloves, and his Limit Break, \"Duel\", requires the player to input button combinations on the controller to deal damage. Zell is slightly impulsive and overconfident in his own skill; however, he is loyal to his friends. Seifer gives him the nickname \"\"chicken-wuss\"\", which infuriates him. He also has a passion for hot dogs; a recurring gag is that they are always sold out by the time he reaches the cafeteria.\n\nZell lived at the same orphanage as many of the other protagonists; this is where Seifer first began to bully him. He was later adopted by the Dincht family in the town of Balamb. His motivation for enrolling at Garden is to live up to the memory of his grandfather, a famous soldier.\n\nZell was designed to look and act like the main character of a shōnen manga (Japanese comic books intended primarily for boys); his neighbors in Balamb describe him as a \"'comic-bookish' type of hero\". He also thinks of himself as Seifer's rival, despite not being the main character. The inspiration for the tattoo on his face came from an MTV music video that featured a man with a full body tattoo.\n\nZell's ultimate weapon is named \"Ehrgeiz\", directly referencing the game of the same name which came out around the same time \"Final Fantasy VIII\" did. Also, continuing the similarities to Tifa Lockhart of \"Final Fantasy VII\", Zell has a limit break called \"Dolphin Blow\" as does Tifa, Zell's final limit break is \"My Final Heaven\", while Tifa's was called just \"Final Heaven\".\n\nHe is voiced by Noriaki Sugiyama in Japanese.\n\n is a student at Galbadia Garden, one of the three mercenary academies in the game. He is one of the Garden's elite sharpshooters, always carrying his rifle. His Limit Break is \"Shot\", which deals damage and inflicts status effects depending on the type of ammunition. Irvine is depicted as a cowboy, tall and fair-skinned with long brown hair that he wears pulled back in a ponytail. He also enjoys flirting with the female characters, being known as well for his marksmanship as his charm. He acts like a carefree, but misunderstood loner; however, this is merely a façade to charm women and hide his lack of confidence.\n\nWhen Sorceress Edea becomes the Galbadian ambassador, Balamb and Galbadia Gardens order Squall's team to assassinate her; Irvine is introduced as the sniper for the mission. Moments before the assassination attempt, he explains to Squall that he always chokes under pressure. In spite of his nerves and under intense pressure, he fires an accurate shot, but Edea uses magic to stop the bullet. At Trabia Garden, Irvine reveals that he and most of the other party members had lived in the same orphanage, run by Cid and Edea Kramer. However, the others could not remember this because of their use of Guardian Forces (GF), magical beings who cause severe long-term memory loss as a side effect. Because Irvine had not used a GF until he joined the party, he is able to remember his past. During the game, Irvine gradually draws closer to Selphie, acting on the feeling he has had since living with her at the orphanage.\n\nWith Irvine, Nomura tried to strike a balance between not overshadowing Squall and not becoming too unattractive. He gave Irvine a handsome appearance, but a casual personality, hoping that this would make him less attractive than Squall. Keeping with this idea, Nomura gave him goggles; however, this idea was abandoned in favor of an American cowboy-like appearance to set him apart from other goggle-wearing characters in the \"Final Fantasy\" series.\n\nHe is voiced by Daisuke Hirakawa in Japanese.\n\n is one of Laguna's comrades in the Galbadian Army. He wields a pair of katar (कटार) or gauntlet-daggers, with which he repeatedly slices his enemies in his Limit Break, \"Blood Pain\". His weapons' name is given as \"katal\" in the English localization of the game. Following the failed mission in Centra, Kiros is separated from Laguna and Ward. He heals quickly and decides to leave the Galbadian army, but soon finds that life without Laguna lacks excitement. His subsequent search for Laguna brings him to Winhill after nearly a year. When Laguna is forced to leave Winhill to find Ellone, Kiros accompanies him, helping him earn money as an amateur actor to fund the expedition. Kiros remains by Laguna's side throughout his adventures in Esthar, earning a place as Laguna's advisor when he becomes president. Like Ward, Kiros' interactions with Laguna are based on the staff's interactions during development.\n\n is Laguna's other comrade. An imposing man, he wields a large harpoon in battle; in his Limit Break, \"Massive Anchor\", he uses it to crush his opponents from above. During the incident at Centra, he loses his voice in a battle with Esthar soldiers. After being separated from Laguna and Kiros, he becomes a janitor at the D-District Prison. When Laguna becomes president of Esthar, Ward joins Kiros as an advisor, directing affairs with gestures and ellipses. Laguna and Kiros can understand what he is saying by his reactions. Like Kiros, Ward's interactions with Laguna are based on the staff's interactions during development.\n\n is initially presented as a power-hungry sorceress who seizes control of Galbadia from President Deling. Her motives are unknown, but SeeD dispatches Squall to assassinate her. The mission fails after Rinoa is taken over by an unknown entity and Edea sends a bolt of ice through Squall's chest.\n\nLater, it is revealed that Edea is actually the wife of Headmaster Cid, and was known as \"Matron\" to Squall and the other kids that lived at the orphanage. It is eventually explained that Edea was not acting of her own will, but was possessed by a sorceress from the future named Ultimecia. When Ultimecia's control is broken, Edea takes the side of the SeeDs in the struggle and joins Squall's party for a short time. However, she accidentally gives her powers to Rinoa, making her a sorceress. Being a sorceress, Edea attacks with magical bursts of energy and her Limit Break, \"Ice Strike\", consists of a magically conjured icicle, hurled like a javelin.\n\nEdea is one of three character concepts, along with Fujin and Raijin, to have been created before \"Final Fantasy VIII\". Tetsuya Nomura had designed Edea even before the development of \"Final Fantasy VII\", based on the style of Yoshitaka Amano, who was the character illustrator of \"Final Fantasy VI\" and previous games. Edea's design is used in \"Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy\" as an alternate costume of Ultimecia's. Although she has not appeared in \"Final Fantasy\" spin off games, her namesake has been carried into the \"Bravely Default\" series with Edea Lee.\n\n is a sorceress from Esthar who initiated the Sorceress War some years ago before the start of the game. As the ruler of Esthar, she ordered her soldiers to abduct every girl to find a suitable successor for her powers, including the young Ellone. During the Esthar revolution, Laguna and Dr. Odine devised an artifact to cancel the sorceress power, and placed her in suspended animation in outer space. In the present, after Edea is released from Ultimecia's control, Ultimecia possesses the new sorceress, Rinoa, and commands her to free Adel, so she can become Ultimecia's new and more powerful vessel. Adel is successfully freed, so Rinoa is discarded as a host. However, in order to defeat Ultimecia, Dr. Odine plans for Ultimecia to once again possess Rinoa. Eventually, Squall's party defeats Adel when she tries to absorb Rinoa at the Lunatic Pandora, thus Adel's powers transfer to Rinoa, Ultimecia possesses her again, and using Ellone's powers, they start \"Time Compression\", which leads to the final battle.\n\n is the headmaster of Balamb Garden. After the failed assassination attempt on Edea, the Garden Master, NORG, attempts to seize power from Cid and reconcile with Edea. This sparks an internal conflict, in which the students and personnel side with either Cid or NORG. However, Squall and Xu quell the conflict and return Cid to power. Afterward, Cid aggressively confronts NORG, who started the conflict over financial issues. Cid is the husband of Sorceress Edea, with whom he ran an orphanage and founded the SeeD organization. They are estranged for most of the game, however, because they lead opposing factions until Ultimecia releases her magical possession of Edea.\n\nBecause most \"Final Fantasy\" titles include a character named \"Cid\", Nomura wanted to design someone with differences from the past Cids in the series. He gave this version of Cid the appearance and personality of an older, benevolent character who would watch over Squall's party and offer them advice and motivation. Nojima decided that this type of good-natured character would work best as the headmaster of Balamb Garden.\n\n is a mysterious girl and the missing \"Sis\" of Squall's past. She has the ability to send a person's consciousness back in time and into the body of another, so they can experience the actions of that person. She uses this talent to send Squall's party into Laguna's past adventures, hoping that they would alter the past; however, she eventually realizes that her abilities can only view history, not alter it. Ultimecia needs this power to achieve \"Time Compression\", so she uses Edea and the Galbadian military to find her.\n\nEllone is an important character in the story, tying the relationships between some of the characters, and being the primary objective of Ultimecia. However, Ellone's importance is mostly told in the flashbacks, and explained gradually. After Ellone's parents were killed by Esthar soldiers, under orders of sorceress Adel, she lived with Raine in the small Winhill village, where she also developed a close relationship with her adoptive uncle, Laguna. These peaceful times lasted until she was finally captured by Esthar. Then, Laguna travelled to Esthar to rescue her, at the same time he participated in Esthar's rebellion to overthrow Adel. After Adel's incarceration in space, Laguna having to remain in Esthar as president, and then Raine's death, Ellone moved to Cid and Edea's orphanage, where she became an older sister figure to Squall and the other orphans, and eventually she also followed Cid to Balamb Garden. Early in the game, Squall's party finds Ellone in the library of Balamb Garden, but the characters don't have further interactions. It is later explained that the \"Guardian Forces\" (GF) which the SeeDs use in battle cause memory loss, thus explaining why Squall doesn't remember Ellone, Edea and his past in the orphanage.\n\n is a young woman with pale skin, short silver hair and an eye patch. She is a member of Balamb Garden's disciplinary committee with Seifer and Raijin; the three of them form a close \"posse\", even when Seifer leaves Garden. Fujin prefers to speak in terse sentences, often with only a single word, such as \"RAGE!\" and \"LIES!\" (in the Japanese version she only spoke in Kanji). However, near the end of the game, she explains to Squall that she will temporarily break ties with Seifer because of his recent behavior. In battle, Fujin wields a chakram and uses wind-based magic. She shares her name with the Japanese god of wind, Fūjin.\n\nFujin and Raijin were to appear in \"Final Fantasy VII\"; however, the designers excluded them due to their similarity to the Turks. In \"Kingdom Hearts II\", a younger version of Fujin, named , appears as a member of Seifer's gang. She is voiced by Rio Natsuki in the Japanese version and by Jillian Bowen in the English version.\n\n is a member of Balamb Garden's disciplinary committee with Seifer and Fujin; the three form a close \"posse\", as he calls it. He has a habit of ending his sentences with . Like Fujin, he supports Seifer when he betrays SeeD and Garden to side with Edea. Near the end of the game, he stands by Fujin's plea to the party to help save Seifer from himself. In the ending FMV, he celebrates catching a large fish until Fujin kicks him into the water. In battle, Raijin uses thunder-based magic and a bō staff with large weights on either end. He shares his name with the Japanese god of thunder, Raijin.\n\nRaijin and Fujin were to appear in \"Final Fantasy VII\"; however, the designers decided against it due to their similarity to the Turks. In \"Kingdom Hearts II\", a younger version of Raijin, named , appears as a member of Seifer's gang. He is voiced by Kazuya Nakai in the Japanese version, and by Brandon Adams in the English version.\n\n is the main antagonist of \"Final Fantasy VIII\". Because she operates through the body of a possessed Edea to gain control of Galbadia, Ultimecia's existence is revealed only after possessing Rinoa to release Sorceress Adel from her orbital prison to take as a new host. A sorceress from the future, Ultimecia is capable of reaching her consciousness into the distant past via a special \"Junction Machine\" to possess other sorceresses. She seeks to achieve \"Time Compression\", which would cause all eras to merge; this would extinguish all life but her own as she becomes an omnipresent goddess. This would give her power on a par to Hyne the Great, who, according to the background had created the world.\n\nIn fact, Squall and the heroes do help Ultimecia start Time Compression, but they do so to confront her in her own time. After Squall and his party defeat Sorceress Adel, Adel transfers her power to Rinoa, then Ultimecia possesses Rinoa again, and Ellone uses her power to send their consciousness to the past, at which point Ultimecia starts Time Compression. At that moment, the heroes are able to travel to Ultimecia's distant future and defeat her. After the final battle and during an apparent decompression of time, the defeated Ultimecia transfers her powers to Edea at a point in the past. This action essentially triggers the sequence of events that form the game's plot, and creates a \"causal loop\".\n\nUltimecia is the villainess representing \"Final Fantasy VIII\" in \"\", \"Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy\" and \"Dissidia Final Fantasy NT\", where she is voiced by Atsuko Tanaka in Japanese and Tasia Valenza in English.\n\nBiggs and Wedge are members of the Galbadian Army. Biggs is a major and Wedge is a lieutenant. After the main characters defeat the duo at Dollet, they are demoted in rank to lieutenant and private respectively. The protagonists encounter them again at the D-District Prison. A third meeting at the Lunatic Pandora does not result in conflict; instead, they quit the Galbadian army. They continue the \"Final Fantasy\" tradition of including two minor characters with the names \"Biggs\" and \"Wedge.\"\n\nGeneral Fury Caraway is a member of the Galbadian military who advises the main characters on their mission to assassinate Sorceress Edea. When Laguna left Galbadia, Caraway comforted Julia; eventually, they married and had a child, Rinoa. Caraway and Rinoa have a problematic relationship; he attempts to prevent her from participating in the assassination attempt. However, he later arranges her freedom from the D-District Prison.\n\nVinzer Deling is the President of Galbadia. He appoints Sorceress Edea as a supposed \"peace ambassador\" to resolve Galbadia's political problems with other nations. His body double is defeated by SeeD and the Forest Owls resistance group. Edea kills him during her welcoming ceremony at Deling City and seizes power in Galbadia.\n\nMayor Dobe is the leader of Fishermans Horizon, a town in the middle of a transoceanic highway between the continents of Galbadia and Esthar. He and his wife, Flo, detest violence and oppose the Garden's presence in their territory. Squall and his party save the Mayor from certain death when the Galbadian army invades the town.\n\nThe Forest Owls are a small resistance faction that oppose the Galbadian occupation of Timber, a town in the eastern part of the continent. A man named Zone is the leader, and Rinoa and Watts are members. Most people of Timber are affiliated with a resistance group, although the Forest Owls are the only active ones.\n\n is a pianist at a Galbadian hotel frequented by Laguna during his days as a soldier. After being secretly admired by Laguna for some time, Julia introduces herself, as depicted in one of the flashback sequences. Julia reveals to Laguna her dream of writing her own songs and becoming a singer. Laguna is shipped out on new orders the following day and the ensuing circumstances prevent him from returning. Julia eventually marries Galbadian military officer General Caraway and has a daughter, Rinoa. She also finds success with her song \"Eyes On Me\", which is also the game's theme song. She is killed several years before the start of the game in a car accident. Julia is the only character in the game with an explicit character theme, named \"Julia\", which is a piano arrangement of \"Eyes On Me\".\n\n, later , is Laguna's second love depicted in the flashbacks. She finds him injured at the bottom of a cliff and brings him to her hometown of Winhill to recover. She is irked at first by Laguna's bad habits and reluctance to express himself outright, but the two grow close and marry. After Laguna becomes President of Esthar, his duties thwart his efforts to return to Winhill. Raine dies after giving birth to a child, who, along with Ellone, is taken away to Edea's orphanage. It is strongly implied by Ward and Kiros, as well as by gaming writers and fans, that Squall is their child.\n\nMartine is the head of Galbadia Garden. His superior, Balamb Garden's master NORG, orders him to use SeeD members to carry out the assassination plot against Sorceress Edea. When Squall and his team travel to Galbadia Garden after fleeing Timber, Martine orders them to carry out the mission. He hopes that using Balamb Garden's SeeDs would deflect responsibility for the plot onto NORG. His actions trigger the conflict within Balamb Garden when Garden Master NORG tries to kill Headmaster Cid to appease Sorceress Edea after the mission fails. Afterward, the Galbadian military seizes Galbadia Garden and Martine flees to the pacifist city of Fishermans Horizon.\n\nNORG is an exiled Shumi who lent Cid the money to build and develop the Garden and took the position of Garden Master upon its completion. NORG is more concerned about the revenue acquired by SeeD as a mercenary organization rather than its noble duty of opposing the Sorceress; he is considered a \"black sheep\" of the Shumi tribe. After hearing about a failed assassination attempt on Sorceress Edea, NORG begins to distrust Headmaster Cid and tries to seize control of Balamb Garden, causing a conflict between factions loyal to NORG and Cid. Feigning loyalty to the Sorceress, he attempts to kill the SeeDs who carried out the failed assassination. After he is defeated in battle, he enters a cocoon-like state. Shumis from the Shumi village later appear at the site of his defeat. They appear to have removed him from his cocoon by cracking it open. They also apologize for NORG's behaviour.\n\nDr. Odine is a scientist and magic researcher from Esthar. He discovered the GFs and junctioning and engineered a machine that mimics Ellone's power. Seventeen years before the game, he developed the necessary technology to allow Laguna to entomb Adel. As a researcher of the Lunatic Pandora, he also helps to prevent it from reaching Tears' Point and initiating a Lunar Cry. Odine also plays a role in the plot to destroy Ultimecia, explaining how to survive time compression.\n\nSeveral other SeeD members assist Squall's party. Dr. Kadowaki is the Balamb Garden doctor who tends to Squall's wounds after his fight with Seifer in the opening sequence. She also helps Headmaster Cid after his confrontation with NORG. Nida (another \"Star Wars\" reference, along with Biggs and Wedge) is a student at Balamb Garden who passes the SeeD exam along with Squall. He pilots Balamb Garden after it becomes a mobile base. Lastly, Xu is a high-ranking SeeD who helps Squall during the Dollet mission and the Garden civil war between NORG and Cid. She is friends with Quistis and a member of Squall's staff once he becomes the leader of Balamb Garden.\n\nThe characters of \"Final Fantasy VIII\" have spawned action figures, jewellery and other goods in their likeness. In 1999, action figure lineups were distributed in Japan by Bandai, Kotobukiya, Banpresto, and Coca-Cola. Bandai also released them to Europe and Australasia the same year. In 2004, action figures of Squall, Rinoa and Selphie were distributed in North America by Diamond Comics. Posters of individual characters or a collage of characters are available on many fan websites, including Final Fantasy Spirit. Other products available include mouse pads, keychains, and pens depicting individual characters or sets of characters.\n\nThe characters of \"Final Fantasy VIII\" have received praise by reviewers. The \"Gaming Age\" reviewer was originally concerned with the shift to consistently realistically proportioned characters, but he ultimately found them more appealing. Moreover, the review stated that the character designs and graphical quality allowed the characters to \"convey emotions much more dramatically\". \"Game Revolution\" cited similar praise, agreeing that the change \"really makes the graphics impressive\". Jeff Lundigran of IGN commented that the \"low-polygon characters of \"Final Fantasy VII\" are gone, replaced with sometimes surprisingly realistic high-polygon models that only look better the closer they get\". GameSpot agreed with the transition, claiming that \"involving, personal, and emotional stories are far more believable when they come from, well, people, not short, bizarrely shaped cartoon characters\".\n\nThe cast itself has received criticism from reviews. Lundigran criticized the manner in which romantic interactions play out, stating that \"considering that the love story is so integral to everything that happens—not to mention forming the central image of the box art—it's incomprehensible why no one says 'I love you' to anyone, ever\". With Squall, he felt that \"FFVIII does break one cardinal rule: when your story is character centered, you'd better center it on a character the audience can care about. Squall, unfortunately, just doesn't fit the bill\". However, GameSpot felt that \"Final Fantasy VIII\" shifts the story from the \"epic\" concepts of \"Final Fantasy VII\" to the \"personal\", in that \"the characters and their relationships are all extremely believable and complex; moreover, the core romance holds up even under the most pessimistic scrutiny\". A later editorial by IGN's Ryan Clements echoed this sentiment, appreciating that Squall and Rinoa's single kiss during the finale serves \"one of the player's main rewards for hours of dedication\". Although the reviewer at \"Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine\" acknowledged possible fears over a romantic storyline, he stated that \"it's only later in the game, once you are really attached to all the distinct and complex characters, that the more emotional themes are gradually introduced\".\n\n"}

His mother Elsa Kühne was an opera singer and his father Joseph Klarwein was a Brick Expressionist architect and later with the Bauhaus movement. His family was of Jewish origin and they fled to the British Mandate of Palestine when he was two years old, after the rise of Nazi Germany. In 1948 when the territory became Israel, his family traveled to Paris. There Mati studied from 1949 to 1951 with Fernand Léger, and attended the art schools École des Beaux-Arts and Académie Julian.\n\nKlarwein added \"Abdul\" (which means \"servant\" in Arabic) to his name in the late 1950s to express his sentiments about the hostility between Jews and Muslims in the Middle East: he felt that to understand each other better, every Jew should adopt a Muslim first name, and vice versa. In 1956 he met Kitty Lillaz, and traveled with her around the world, including Tibet, India, Bali, North Africa, Turkey, Europe and the Americas.\n\nIn the early 1960s he settled for a while in New York City, meeting Jimi Hendrix. At a New York exhibition in 1961, organized by Lillaz for the unveiling of the painting \"Flight to Egypt\" Klarwein met Salvador Dali for the first time, whom he called a spiritual father. The same year he met his wife Sofia Klarwein. Among other painters he met more often was Arik Brauer. In 1965, he obtained French citizenship with the support of André Malraux.\n\nDuring his time in Saint-Tropez he met Ernst Fuchs, who would have a profound influence on his technique, teaching him the \"Mischtechnik\". Much of Klarwein's most famous work is inspired by surrealism and pop culture, but also reflects his interest in deities and symbolism.\n\nKlarwein is still best known for his art of the 1960s and 1970s, with its clear links to surrealism, popular psychedelic imagery, ethnic and exotic themes, erotic, and religious art from a number of different traditions. He also worked more conventionally across a variety of genres including still life, landscape, and portrait.\n\nThe art and culture magazine \"Juxtapoz\", quoting an unnamed source, wrote that Klarwein was \"often considered 'the man literally responsible for every great, legendary record cover you've ever seen—if he didn't do it, he inspired it.'\" Despite the hyperbole of this claim, it is true that many people would immediately recognize his vivid, colorful style from many album covers.\n\nDuring the '60s Klarwein's fame grew and some of the decade's most progressive musicians used his artwork for their album covers.\n\nIn his painting \"Grain of Sand\" (1963–1965), many disparate images are combined together in one massive, yet oddly coherent work. Klarwein's own words illuminate the work: \"I projected it as a sort of painted musical comedy movie with a Sanskrit swinging cast of thousands, starring Marilyn Monroe, Anita Ekberg, Ray Charles, Pablo Picasso, Brigitte Bardot, Roland Kirk, Cannonball Adderley, Ahmed Abdul Malik, Wonder Woman, Delacroix's Orphan Girl at the Cemetery, Litri and his bullfighters, Lawrence of Arabia, Socrates, Dalí, Rama, Vishnu, Ganesh, the Zork and a Milky Way of Playmates.\"\n\nKlarwein created the cover for the 2 February 1970 \"Time\" magazine issue, showing the face of Barry Commoner (visit article for artwork), projecting a powerful image of ecology, which took the stage for the first time in the public eye.\n\nKlarwein's painting \"Annunciation\" from 1961 was seen in reproduction by the musician Carlos Santana, who subsequently used it 1970 as the cover image of his band Santana's second album \"Abraxas\". In the following years Klarwein produced comparably striking designs for the covers of two Miles Davis albums, \"Bitches Brew\" (1969) and \"Live-Evil\" (1971). His painting \"Zonked\" (1970) was originally planned as the cover image for Betty Davis's self-titled album, and was later used for the Last Poets album \"Holy Terror\" in 1993. In 1971 his cover was on the album \"Last Days and Time\" by Earth, Wind & Fire. A cover he made for Jimi Hendrix was used on a single in 1974 and for a compilation in 2010.\n\nThe association of his images with these very successful and widely admired musicians of the time made Klarwein's work known outside the circle of lovers of contemporary art. Many of these paintings, and others, were included in Klarwein's first book \"Milk n' Honey\" (1973).\n\nIn 1971 he went to Hamburg and created set paintings for the film \"Herman Hesse's Steppenwolf\". In the mid-1970s, Klarwein began a series of paintings which he referred to as \"real-estate paintings\" or \"inscapes\". In the late 1970s he collaborated with trumpeter Jon Hassell for a couple of albums on Brian Eno's Ambient label; these albums used several of Klarwein's \"inscapes\" on their covers.\n\nIn the '80's, Klarwein began to focus on landscape compositions, which were detailed, had different perspectives and often included floric textures. During the 1980s and 1990s, Klarwein would occasionally search for cheap paintings at flea markets and \"improve\" them, painting over them or adding things at his whim. Klarwein made over a hundred of these \"improved paintings\" throughout his career. In 1983 he published \"Inscapes Real-Estate Paintings\", which included an interview where Klarwein said about his work, \"Some visual artworks are made to be talked about more than to be seen, others are made to be seen more than to be talked about. I think I belong in the latter category.\"\n\nKlarwein also painted many commissioned portraits, including Robert Graves, Noël Coward, Juliette Binoche, Richard Gere, Michael Douglas and Brigitte Bardot. He died of cancer on March 7, 2002, in Deià, on the Spanish island of Majorca.\n\n\n\n"}

He made his WWWF debut at a TV taping in the Philadelphia Arena on 20 September 1972 as a babyface, defeating Davey O'Hannon. On 30 May 1973, he teamed with Haystacks Calhoun and defeated Mr. Fuji and Professor Toru Tanaka to win his first WWWF World Tag Team Championship. Garea and Calhoun feuded with Fuji and Tanaka for the rest of the summer before losing the titles back to Fuji and Tanaka on 11 September.\n\nGarea continued the feud with Fuji and Tanaka with a new partner, Dean Ho. On 14 November, Garea and Ho defeated Fuji and Tanaka for Garea's second and Ho's first WWWF World Tag Team Championship. Garea's second tag team reign was longer and better than his first reign. They held the titles for five and a half-month before losing them to the Valiant Brothers (Jimmy and Johnny) on 8 May 1974 episode of \"All Star Wrestling\". They continued teaming for a while before disbanding their tag team and working on their own. Garea, who had been successful as a tag team wrestler, began a singles career.\n\nGarea continued his singles career for three years before forming a tag team with new partner Larry Zbyzsko in August 1977. They began teaming after entering a tag team tournament for the vacant tag titles, where they were defeated by Mr. Fuji and Toru Tanaka in the finals on 27 September 1977. They continued to challenge for the titles before defeating The Yukon Lumberjacks (Eric and Pierre) for Garea's third and Zbyzsko's first WWWF World Tag Team Championship on edition of 21 November 1978 of \"Championship Wrestling\". They held the titles for four months before losing them to Valiant Brothers (Jerry and Johnny) on edition of 24 March 1979 of \"Championship Wrestling\". Later that same month, \"Wide\" was dropped from the promotion's name, renaming the promotion World Wrestling Federation.\n\nGarea continued to wrestle in the tag team division, with another former WWF Tag Team Champion Rene Goulet. The two participated in a tag team tournament for the titles, where they were defeated by The Wild Samoans (Afa and Sika) in the finals on 27 September 1980. Garea formed a tag team with new partner Rick Martel, which was Garea's most successful and most popular tag team. They defeated Wild Samoans on 8 November for Garea's fourth and Martel's first WWF Tag Team Championship. Garea and Martel continued to feud with the former champions for the rest of the year. After Wild Samoans left WWF, the champions began feuding with The Moondogs (King and Rex). They dropped the titles to Moondogs on edition of 17 March 1981 of \"Championship Wrestling\".\n\nMartel and Garea continued to feud with Moondogs, trying to regain the titles. On 8 June, Garea beat a young rookie named Man Mountain Canyon in Madison Square Garden, who returned to WWF four years later as King Kong Bundy. On edition of 21 July of \"Championship Wrestling\", Martel and Garea defeated Moondogs in a rematch to win their second WWF Tag Team Championship as a team, though, it was Garea's fifth and final individual reign. Garea's final run as a tag team champion ended on edition of 17 October of \"Championship Wrestling\" after Garea and Martel were defeated by Mr. Fuji and Mr. Saito for the tag titles. Garea and Martel continued to feud with Fuji and Saito, trying to regain the titles but failed to do so.\n\nMartel left WWF in 1982 while Garea went on his own. Garea teamed with newcomers to the WWF such as Eddie Gilbert and B. Brian Blair in 1983 and 1984 but was unable to recapture the success he previously enjoyed as a tag-team champion. He moved to the jobber to the stars status, jobbing to rising newcomers before retiring in 1986.\n\nGarea was employed as a road agent by WWF, a position he continues to hold. He appeared with former tag team partner Rick Martel at in June 2007. They came to the aid of the team of Sgt. Slaughter and Jimmy Snuka, who were being attacked following their losing to Deuce 'n Domino.\n\nWhen WWE came to New Zealand on 11 June 2008 in Auckland, Garea was a guest on the first international V.I.P Lounge along with Bushwacker Butch. The segment's host, Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) announced him as Bushwhacker Luke but then apologised. Eventually, MVP attacked Butch and Garea with the microphone. Butch and Garea recovered and fought off MVP, then celebrated with the Bushwhacker walk. On 3 March 2009 he was featured on WWE.com exclusive segment \"Top-rope Theater\" posing as \"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan. On 29 March 2010 episode of \"Monday Night Raw\" Garea appeared as a lumberjack in the Christian vs. Ted DiBiase lumberjack match. Towards the end of the match, Garea brawled with other legends that were serving as lumberjacks.\n\n\n"}

It was founded by Greeks from Phocaea as Hyele () around 538–535 BC. The name later changed to Ele and then Elea (; ) before it became known by its current Latin and Italian name during the Roman era. Its ruins are located in the Cilento region near the modern village Velia, which was named after the ancient city. The village is a \"frazione\" of the \"comune\" Ascea in the Province of Salerno, Campania, Italy.\n\nThe city was known for being the home of the philosophers Parmenides and Zeno of Elea, as well as the Eleatic school of which they were a part. The site of the acropolis of ancient Elea was once a promontory called Castello a Mare, meaning \"castle on the sea\" in Italian. It now lies inland and was renamed to Castellammare della Bruca in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe town is situated close to the Tyrrhenian coast in a hill zone nearby Marina di Casalvelino and Marina di Ascea, on a road linking Agropoli to the southern Cilentan Coast. Its population is mainly located in the plain by the sea (surrounding the southern part of the ancient ruins) and in the hill zones of Enotria, Bosco and Scifro. Velia also had a railway station on the Naples-Salerno-Reggio Calabria line, closed at the end of the 1970s.\n\nAccording to Herodotus, in 545 BC Ionian Greeks fled Phocaea, in modern Turkey, which was being besieged by the Persians. After some wanderings (8 to 10 years) at sea, they stopped in Reggio Calabria, where they were probably joined by Xenophanes, who was at the time at Messina, and then moved north along the coast and founded the town of Hyele, later renamed Ele and then, eventually, Elea. The location is nearly at the same latitude as Phocaea.\n\nElea was not conquered by the Lucanians, but eventually joined Rome in 273 BC and was included in ancient Lucania. According to Book 6 of Virgil's \"Aeneid\", Velia is the place where the body of Palinurus washed ashore.\n\nRemains of the city walls, with traces of one gate and several towers, of a total length of over three miles, still exist, and belong to three different periods, in all of which the crystalline limestone of the locality is used. Bricks were also employed in later times; their form is peculiar to this place, each having two rectangular channels on one side, and being about 1.5 inches square, with a thickness of nearly 4 inches They all bear Greek brick-stamps. There are some remains of cisterns on the site, and, various other traces of buildings.\n\nThe Eleatics were a school of pre-Socratic philosophers. The group was founded in the early 5th century BC by Parmenides. Other members of the school included Zeno of Elea and Melissus of Samos. Xenophanes is sometimes included in the list, though there is some dispute over this.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the \"Asthana Kavi\" in the court of King Harsha Vardhana, who reigned c. 606–647 CE in north India first from Sthanvishvara (Thanesar), and later Kannauj. Bāna's principal works include a biography of Harsha, the \"Harshacharita\" (Deeds of Harsha), and one of the world's earliest novels, \"Kadambari\". Bāṇa died before finishing the novel and it was completed by his son Bhūṣaṇabhaţţa. Both these works are noted texts of Sanskrit literature. The other works attributed to him are the \"Caṇḍikāśataka\" and a drama, the \"Pārvatīpariṇaya\". Banabhatta gets an applause as \" banochhistam jagatsarvam\" meaning Bana has described everything in this world and nothing is left.\n\nA detailed account regarding his ancestry and early life can be reconstructed from the introductory verses attached to the \"कादम्बरी\" and the first two \"ucchāvasas\" of the \"Harṣhacharita\", while the circumstances behind the composition of the \"Harṣhacharita\" are described in the third \"ucchāvasa\" of the text. \"Harsacarita\" is considered as the first Indian Work which may be regarded as historical. It gives a graphic picture of the life in the country side.\n\nBāna was born to Chitrabhānu and Rājadevi in the village of Pritikuta on the banks of the Hiraṇyavāhu in a Bhojaka family of Vātsyāyana gotra in the current district of Chhapra in modern-day Bihar. After the death of his father, Bāṇa led a wandering life for a period but later came back to his native village. Here, on a summer day, on receiving a letter from Krishna, a cousin of King Harsha, he met the king while he was camping near the town of Manitara. After receiving Bāna with mock signs of anger, the king showed him much favour.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2270344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270344", "title": "Harrison Tweed", "text": "Harrison Tweed\n\nHarrison Tweed (October 18, 1885 – June 16, 1969) was an American lawyer and civic leader.\n\nTweed was born in New York City on October 18, 1885. He was the son of Charles Harrison Tweed, the general counsel for the Central Pacific Railroad, Chesapeake and Ohio and other affiliated railroad corporations, and his wife, (Helen) Minerva Evarts. His maternal grandfather was William M. Evarts, who served successively from 1868 to 1891 as United States Attorney General, United States Secretary of State, and United States Senator from New York, and was one of the leaders of the American Bar Association. His maternal great, great, great grandfather was Paul Dudley Sargent Revolutionary war hero, one of the founding overseers of Bowdoin College. Tweed graduated from St. Mark's School in Southborough, Massachusetts, and received a B.A. from Harvard College in 1907. At Harvard Law School, he served on the law review and was awarded an LL.B. in 1910.\n\nHis career at the bar began with a clerkship in the office of Byrne and Cutcheon in New York City. After service as a captain in World War I, he joined one of the predecessor firms to Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, where he remained as a partner the remainder of his life. Milbank, Tweed was the outside legal arm of Chase Manhattan Bank and the Rockefeller family. Tweed specialized in drafting wills and trust agreements, for the administering of major estates. He wrote briefs in litigation arising out of them and argued, and won, several notable appeals in the New York courts and the United States Supreme Court. Because he was born partially deaf, he never tried a case. In conferences with other lawyers he usually spoke last, and his views generally became the group's consensus. Imitating Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, he had no desk in his office, instead writing at a lectern.\n\nTweed's appointment as chairman of the legal aid committee of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York in 1932, led to a continuing involvement in bar organizations. He became an enthusiastic convert to the necessity of providing competent legal services to all people. Legal aid, he wrote, was \"\"operation equal justice,\" \"an obligation of the bar,\"\" and essential to secure the success of the adversary system. He served as president of the Legal Aid Society of New York from 1936 to 1945, later publishing a history of its first seventy-five years, and of the National Legal Aid & Defender Association from 1949 to 1955.\n\nIn 1945, Tweed was elected president of the New York City bar association. To rejuvenate the staid organization, he brought in younger lawyers, established a bulletin, reorganized committees that issued reports, and created the position of executive secretary. All of this was done in a spirit of openness, equality, informality, and fun (a recurring word with Tweed). In this way, Tweed transformed a stuffy club into a strong progressive force for public service. C. C. Burlingham, the doyen of the New York bar, said that Tweed was \"\"the best president the Bar Association has ever had.\"\"\n\nIn 1947, Tweed became president of the American Law Institute (ALI). He was a guiding force in its major labors—the updating of the institute's published Restatements, as well as the preparation of the Uniform Commercial Code, model codes and statutes on penal law and taxation, and the first restatement on the foreign-relations law of the United States. He took a light, subtle approach, usually talking around the matter at hand so as to envelop the object of his attention; only occasionally did he take a direct part in the proceedings over which he smoothly presided.\n\nStarting in 1947, Tweed was chairman of the ALI - American Bar Association (ABA) joint committee on continuing legal education. Refreshment of the law, Tweed believed, was a professional responsibility. He wrote articles, spoke to lawyers' groups, buttonholed bar leaders, and organized conferences. For many years, a colleague noted, he \"\"was the committee.\"\" The number of administrators of state continuing-legal-education programs increased markedly during his tenure.\n\nEducational matters and public service occupied much of Tweed's time. He served as a trustee of Sarah Lawrence College from 1940 to 1965, including eight years as chairman of the board of trustees (1947 to 1955), and was interim president of the college in 1959-1960. In his term as interim president, he is credited with saving the college from bankruptcy by increasing the number of students. He also served as an overseer of Harvard University from 1950 to 1956, and from 1951 to 1967 he was a trustee of the Cooper Union Center for the Advancement of Science and Art in New York City.\n\nNew York Governor Thomas E. Dewey in 1953 appointed him chairman of the state’s commission to study the reorganization of the judicial branch (courts); many of its recommendations, including the formation of a new judicial conference of the state's judges, were later adopted by the state. In 1963, at the request of US President John F. Kennedy, Tweed became co-chairman of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a position that he held for two years.\n\nTweed believed that lawyers' training to define complicated issues enabled them to play a special role outside the practice of law: \"\"Even if he contributes nothing more than a sense of orderliness and an ability to organize thought and to pose the right questions, the lawyer will have pulled his weight in the boat.\"\" Of his year as president of Sarah Lawrence College, he wrote, \"\"I think that I did manage to bring to the faculty an organization and an understanding of democratic procedures which no one but a lawyer could have done.\"\"\n\nTall, erect, and lean, Tweed was \"\"the most democratic of aristocrats.\"\"He was the only lawyer to be awarded medals for distinguished service from the New York City, New York State, and American bar associations. The ABA tribute noted that his was \"\"the Horatio Alger story in reverse.\" \"I have a high opinion of lawyers,\"\" Tweed said in 1945. \"\"With all their faults, they stack up well against those in every other occupation or profession. They are better to work with or play with or fight with or drink with than most other varieties of mankind.\"\" He died in New York City. \n\nTweed was married three times and divorced twice. By his first marriage on June 14, 1914 to Eleanor Roelker, he had two children. Following his divorce in 1928, he married Blanche Oelrichs Barrymore, the former wife of John Barrymore who used the name Michael Strange in her acting and writing careers. They were divorced in 1942. He married Barbara Banning on 21 November 1942; they had one child.\n\nHis daughter (with Eleanor Roelker) Katharine Winthrop Tweed married Archibald Bulloch Roosevelt, Jr. in 1940 and was divorced in 1950. She had one son, Tweed Roosevelt, born in 1942.\n\nTweed's history of the Legal Aid Society was published as The Legal Aid Society, New York City, 1876-1951) (1954). See his chapter, \"One Lawyer's Life,\" in Albert Love and James Saxon Childers, eds., Listen to Leaders in Law (1963). A series of interviews dealing largely with his law practice are in the Columbia Oral History Collection, Tributes to Tweed appear in the 1969 Association of the Bar of the City of New York Yearbook and the 1970 American Law Institute Proceedings. George Martin, Causes and Conflicts (1970), deals with Tweed's activities in the New York City bar association.

He was a decathlete and football star who was one of the first Black American players in the National Football League in the postwar era. After football, he went on to become a film actor, where he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in \"Spartacus\" in 1960. He served in the United States Army Air Corps during World War II.\n\nStrode was born in Los Angeles. His parents were from New Orleans; his grandmother was a Black Cherokee and his grandfather was a Black Creek.\n\nHe attended Thomas Jefferson High School in South East Los Angeles and college at UCLA, where he was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. His world-class decathlon capabilities were spearheaded by a plus shot put (when the world record was ) and a high jump (the world record at time was ).\n\n\"I got a cultural education—majored in history and education,\" he said in a 1971 interview. \"Never used it, but I could walk into the White House with it now.\"\n\nStrode posed for a nude portrait, part of Hubert Stowitts's acclaimed exhibition of athletic portraits shown at the 1936 Berlin Olympics (although the inclusion of black and Jewish athletes caused the Nazis to close the exhibit).\n\nStrode, Kenny Washington, and Jackie Robinson starred on the 1939 UCLA Bruins football team, in which they made up three of the four backfield players. They became famous nationally as \"the Gold Dust gang\".\n\nAlong with Ray Bartlett, there were four Black Americans playing for the Bruins, when only a few dozen at all played on other college football teams. They played eventual conference and national champion USC to a 0–0 tie with the 1940 Rose Bowl on the line. It was the first UCLA–USC rivalry football game with national implications.\n\nStrode made his first appearance in \"Sundown\" (1941) playing a native policeman. He had a small role in \"Star Spangled Rhythm\" (1942), as a chauffeur of Rochester (Edward Anderson) and could be glimpsed in \"No Time for Love\" (1943).\n\nWhen World War II broke out, Strode was playing for the Hollywood Bears in the Pacific Coast Professional Football League. He was drafted at age 27 and soon joined the United States Army Air Corps and spent the war unloading bombs in Guam and the Marianas, as well as playing on the Army football team at March Field in Riverside, California.\n\nAfter the war, he worked at serving subpoenas and escorting prisoners for the L.A. County District Attorney's Office before being signed, briefly, to the Los Angeles Rams along with Kenny Washington. They were the first Black-American players to play in the NFL for many years. When out on the road with the team, Strode had his first experience with racism, something he wasn't aware of growing up in Los Angeles. \"We were unconscious of color. We used to sit in the best seats at the Cocoanut Grove (a nightclub in the Ambassador Hotel) listening to Donald Novis sing. If someone said, 'there's a Negro over there,' I was just as apt as anyone to turn around and say 'Where?'\"\n\nHe also said, \"On the Pacific Coast there wasn't anything we couldn't do. As we got out of the L.A. area we found these racial tensions. Hell, we thought we were white.\"\n\nStrode and fellow UCLA alumnus Kenny Washington were two of the first African-Americans to play in major college programs and later the modern National Football League, along with Marion Motley and Bill Willis, playing for the Los Angeles Rams in 1946. No black men had played in the NFL from 1933 to 1946. UCLA teammate Jackie Robinson would go on to break the color barrier in Major League Baseball (in fact, all three had played in the semi-professional Pacific Coast Professional Football League earlier in the decade).\n\nIn 1948 he signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers of the All-America Football Conference, but was released before the season started, whereupon he joined the Calgary Stampeders of the Western Interprovincial Football Union in Canada, where he was a member of Calgary's 1948 Grey Cup Championship team before retiring due to injury in 1949. He broke two ribs and a shoulder. \"It was like I had fought Joe Louis,\" he recalled.\n\nIn 1941, Strode had dabbled for several months in professional wrestling. Following the end of his football career in 1949, he returned to wrestling part-time between acting jobs until 1962, wrestling the likes of Gorgeous George.\n\nIn 1952, Strode wrestled almost every week from August 12, 1952, to December 10, 1952, in different cities in California. He was billed as the Pacific Coast Heavyweight Wrestling Champion and the Pacific Coast Negro Heavyweight Wrestling Champion in 1962. He later teamed up with both Bobo Brazil and Bearcat Wright.\n\nStrode's acting career was re-activated when producer Walter Mirisch spotted him wrestling and cast him as an African warrior in \"The Lion Hunters\" (1951), one of the Bomba the Jungle Boy series.\n\nThey wanted him to shave his head. He was reluctant until they offered him $500 a week. “I said, ‘All right, where are the pluckers?’\" Then Strode realised, “I was out in the world market with a bald head. Trapped for life. Finally, it became way of life.”\n\nHe had roles in \"Bride of the Gorilla\" (1951), \"African Treasure\" (1951) (another Bomba film), an episode of \"Dangerous Assignment\" (1952), \"Caribbean\" (1952), and \"Androcles and the Lion\" (1952), playing the lion, \"the toughest job I ever had\" he said later.\n\nStrode was in \"City Beneath the Sea\" (1953) directed by Budd Boetticher, and \"The Royal African Rifles\". Also, he appeared in several episodes of the 1952–1954 television series \"Ramar of the Jungle\", where he portrayed an African warrior.\n\nStrode was a gladiator in \"Demetrius and the Gladiators\" (1954) and was in \"Jungle Man-Eaters\" (1954), a Jungle Jim film. He could be seen in \"The Gambler from Natchez\" (1954), \"Jungle Gents\" (1954) a Bowery Boys movie set in Africa, and \"The Silver Chalice\" (1954).\n\nHe was in a TV adaptation of \"Mandrake the Magician\" (1954), a pilot for a series that was not picked up, and had small parts in \"Son of Sinbad\" (1955), \"Soldiers of Fortune\" (1955), and \"Buruuba\" (1956) a Japanese film set in Africa.\n\nHe appeared once on Johnny Weissmuller's 1955–1956 syndicated television series \"Jungle Jim\" and was in an episode of \"Private Secretary\".\n\nCecil B. DeMille cast him in \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956) as a slave at $500 a week for five weeks. They were unable to find anyone to play the Ethiopian king so Strode was given that role too.\n\nHe had a support role in \"Tarzan's Fight for Life\" (1958) and a small part in \"The Buccaneer\" (1958). In 1959 he portrayed the conflicted, some would say cowardly, Private Franklin in \"Pork Chop Hill\", which brought him critical acclaim. He called it \"the first dramatic thing that I had done.\"\n\nHe guest starred on \"The Man from Blackhawk\" (1960).\n\nStrode was next cast in \"Spartacus\" (1960) as the Ethiopian gladiator Draba, in which he has to fight Spartacus (played by Kirk Douglas) to the death. Draba wins the contest, but instead of killing Spartacus, he attacks the Roman military commander who paid for the fight. He is killed and his death sparks a gladiator rebellion.\n\nStrode had an excellent support part in \"The Last Voyage\" (1960) playing a heroic stoker, though he was only billed fifth.\n\nWhile making \"Pork Chop Hill\" he became a close friend of director John Ford. Ford gave Strode the title role in \"Sergeant Rutledge\" (1960) as a member of the Ninth Cavalry, greatly admired by the other black soldiers in the unit, who is falsely accused of the rape and murder of a white woman.\n\n\"The big studios wanted an actor like Sidney [Poitier] or [Harry] Belafonte,\" recalled Strode. \"And this is not being facetious, but Mr. Ford defended me; and I don't know that this is going on. He said, \"Well, they're not tough enough to do what I want Sergeant Rutledge to be.\"\n\n\"That was a classic,\" he later said. \"It had dignity. John Ford put classic words in my mouth... You never seen a Negro come off a mountain like John Wayne before. I had the greatest Glory Hallelujah ride across the Pecos River that any black man ever had on the screen. And I did it myself. I carried the whole black race across that river.\"\n\nStrode had difficulty maintaining the momentum of these roles. He was in \"The Sins of Rachel Cade\" (1961) and guest starred on \"Rawhide\", playing an Australian aboriginal in the latter. Ford used him again in \"Two Rode Together\" (1962) but it was only a small part, as an Indian. He had a bigger role in \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" (1962) for Ford, playing Pompey, John Wayne's hired hand. In the film, Strode’s character recites the Declaration of Independence but apologizes for forgetting the phrase “all men are created equal,” a poignant line for the 1962 audience.\nPompey/Strode physically carries and thereby saves a drunken, suicidal John Wayne from his burning home.\n\nIn 1963, he was cast opposite Jock Mahoney's Tarzan as both the dying leader of an unnamed Asian country and that leader's unsavory brother, Khan, in \"Tarzan's Three Challenges\". He guest starred on \"The Lieutenant\", \"The Farmer's Daughter\" and \"Daniel Boone\" and had roles in the features \"Genghis Khan\" (1965) and \"7 Women\" (1966), the latter the last film he made for Ford. Strode was very close to the director. \"He treated me like a son,\" said Strode. I had a certain amount of crudeness that went back a hundred years, and that's what he liked.\"\n\nDuring Ford's declining years Strode spent four months sleeping on the director's floor as his caretaker, and he was later present at Ford's death.\n\nIn the late 1960s, he appeared in several episodes of the Ron Ely \"Tarzan\" television series. Strode's other television work included a role as the Grand Mogul in the \"Batman\" episodes \"Marsha, Queen of Diamonds\" and \"Marsha's Scheme of Diamonds\".\n\nIn 1966, he landed a major starring role as a soldier of fortune and expert archer in \"The Professionals\", a major box-office success that established him as a recognizable star.\n\nIn 1967 he attempted to produce his own film, \"The Story of the Tenth Calvary\" but it was not made.\n\nHe based himself in Europe from 1968 to 1971.\n\nHis 1968 starring role as a thinly-disguised Patrice Lumumba in \"Seduto alla sua destra\" (released in the U.S. as \" Black Jesus\") garnered Strode a great deal of press at the time, but the film is largely forgotten now.\n\nHe was an Indian in \"Shalako\" (1968) and played a gunslinger in the opening sequence of Sergio Leone's \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" (1968). He decided to stay in Europe. \"I had five pairs of blue jeans, I was lonely, and I didn't speak the language,\" he said. \"But the producers answered, \"Not necessary. You ride horses.' \" \n\nStrode was in \"Che!\" (1969) and supported Terence Hill and Bud Spencer in \"Boot Hill\" (1969) shot in Italy. He stayed in Europe to make another Western \"The Unholy Four\" (1970) and went back to Hollywood to do a TV movie \"Breakout\" (1970) and two Westerns \"The Deserter\" (also known as \"The Devil's Backbone\") (1971), and \"The Gatling Gun\" (1971). The scripts for these were variable but Strode later said \"Me, I didn't care. If the money was right, I'd play Mickey Mouse.”\n\nStrode went to Europe to make \"Scipio the African\" (1971) and did some more Westerns: \"The Last Rebel\" (1971), and \"The Revengers\" (1972) (a \"regular knockdown, drag‐out western” said Strode). He later said his salary in Italy went up to $10,000 a week.\n\nHe did \"The Italian Connection\" (1972), for which he was paid $150,000. \n\"Race is not a factor in the world market,\" he said in 1981. \"I once played a part written for an Irish prize fighter. I've done everything but play an Anglo-Saxon. I'd do that if I could. I'd play a Viking with blue contact lenses and a blond wig if I could. My dream is to play a Mexican bandit in the international market.\"\n\nHe was also in \"Key West\" (1973), \"Loaded Guns\" (1975), \"The Manhunter\" (1975), \"We Are No Angels\" (1975), \"Winterhawk\" (1975), \"Keoma\" (1976), episodes of \"The Quest\" (1976) and \"How the West Was Won\" (1977), \"Oil\" (1977), \"Martinelli, Outside Man\" (1977), \"Kingdom of the Spiders\" (1977), \"Cowboy-San!\" (1978), \"Ravagers\" (1979), \"Jaguar Lives!\" (1979), and an episode of \"Buck Rogers in the 25th Century\" (1979).\n\nStrode's later appearances included \"Cuba Crossing\" (1980),\"The Dukes of Hazzard \" (1980), \"Scream\" (1981), \"Fantasy Island\" (1981), \"Vigilante\" (1982), \"Invaders of the Lost Gold\" (1982), \"\" (1983), \"The Black Stallion Returns\" (1983), \"The Violent Breed\" (1984), \"Jungle Warriors\" (1984), \"The Cotton Club\" (1984), \"The Final Executioner\" (1984), \"Lust in the Dust\" (1985), \"On Fire\" (1987), and \"A Gathering of Old Men\" (1987).\n\nStrode was in \"Storyville\" (1992), and \"Posse\" (1992), working with director Mario Van Peebles. His last film was \"The Quick and the Dead\" (1995), which starred Gene Hackman, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Russell Crowe. The closing credits dedicate the film to Strode.\n\nIn 1980, Strode was inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame.\n\nHis first wife was Princess Luukialuana Kalaeloa (a.k.a. Luana Strode), a distant relative of Liliuokalani, the last queen of Hawaii. \"You'd have thought I was marrying Lana Turner, the way the whites in Hollywood acted,\" he later said.\n\nWith her he had a son, Kalai (a.k.a. Kalaeloa), in 1946, and a daughter, June. They were married until her death in 1980 due to Parkinson's disease. In 1982 at the age of 68, he wed 35-year-old Tina Tompson, and they remained married until his death of lung cancer on , 1994, in Glendora, California, aged 80. He is buried at Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California.\n\nStrode was a dedicated martial artist under the direction of Frank Landers in the art of Seishindo Kenpo.\n\nSheriff Woody of the \"Toy Story\" series of animated films is named after Strode, as was the recurring character of the Santa Barbara Coroner in the television series \"Psych\".\n\n\n\n"}

During Cecil's quest, he is joined by his childhood friends Kain Highwind and Rosa Farrell, as well as other warriors from around the world who also seek to stop Golbez. The visuals of the characters were designed by Yoshitaka Amano. After its initial release, \"Final Fantasy IV\" was later ported to multiple consoles. In 2007, Square Enix released an enhanced remake for the Nintendo DS that added voice acting to both the Japanese and English versions.\n\nThe game's 2008 sequel, \"\" is set seventeen years after \"Final Fantasy IV\" and includes most of the characters from the original game as well as introducing several new characters. The story of \"The After Years\" primarily revolves around Ceodore Harvey, the son of Cecil and Rosa. In 2011, a third game in the series was released. Set one year after \"Final Fantasy IV\" and sixteen years prior to \"The After Years\", \"Final Fantasy IV Interlude\", was released for the PlayStation Portable, and featured several of the original \"Final Fantasy IV\" protagonists.\n\nAs \"Final Fantasy IV\" was the first game in the series on the Super Famicom, character designer Yoshitaka Amano took advantage of the console's graphical capabilities, designing much more elaborate characters than prior entries. Lead designer Takashi Tokita noted how he and the staff worked in making all of the game's cast fit into the story. The characters were well received by video game publications with several of them finding the cast innovative thanks to their characterization.\n\nAccording to \"Final Fantasy IV\" lead designer Takashi Tokita, \"Final Fantasy IV\" was the first Japanese role-playing game to feature such \"deep characters.\" The graphical capabilities of the Super Famicom allowed character designer Yoshitaka Amano to create more elaborate designs than he had done for previous games released for the Famicom. Tokita stated that although his inexperience may have hurt the story, the characters' personalities and roles made the story more appealing. Tokita also pointed out the variety of characters helped to appeal to a wider demographic, stating that the team worked hard to make all side characters fit into the story, something that, at the time, was difficult to do in Japanese media. For the Nintendo DS remake, the characters were handled by Airi Yoshioka. In \"Final Fantasy IV: The After Years\", the characters were designed by Akira Oguro.\n\nTokita stated that the inclusion of voice actors in the DS remake was pleasing for him, claiming that the voice-overs \"allowed for a much more dramatic localization.\" The Japanese voice actors reflected Tokita's vision of the characters, but he noted that others did not feel the same way. English translator Tom Slattery had to change various parts of the original script for the voiced scenes in order for the characters' mouth movements to match the words they were speaking.\n\n is the protagonist of \"Final Fantasy IV\" and \"Interlude\" and a major character in \"The After Years\". He was raised by the King of Baron to become a Dark Knight. Although Cecil is reluctant to master the Dark Sword, he excels as a Dark Knight and is eventually promoted to the command of Baron's airship fleet, the \"Red Wings\". When the King orders Cecil to rob the magical town of Mysidia of its Water Crystal at the cost of killing innocent people, Cecil begins to question the king's morality. After the King tricks him into bombing the village of Mist, Cecil openly rebels and forms an alliance of warriors to oppose Baron. His first recruit is Rydia, a child he rescues from Mist. During his quest, he becomes a Paladin by climbing Mt. Ordeals and overcoming the darkness in his heart. This represents one of the game's themes; \"brute strength alone isn't power,\" as when he becomes a Paladin, Cecil's power actually decreases, although he gradually becomes more powerful than he ever was as a Dark Knight. Cecil reaches Baron and learns that the new leader of the Red Wings is a man named Golbez, and that Golbez's minion, Cagnazzo, had killed and impersonated the king. With his companions, Cecil is able to defeat Cagnazzo but Golbez continues to hunt for the Crystals and Cecil must continue his quest. He ultimately learns that he is the son of a Lunarian, Kluya, and that Golbez is his brother. Golbez himself is not evil, but is being controlled by Zemus, a Lunarian who wants to wipe out all life on the Blue Planet. Although Cecil initially cannot accept that Golbez is innocent, he later forgives him, acknowledging him as his brother after Zemus' defeat. Cecil then returns to Baron, marries with Rosa, and becomes the new King of Baron.\n\n\"Interlude\" depicts Cecil investigating the unexplained appearance of multiple monsters one year after the events of \"Final Fantasy IV\". The game ends with Cecil discovering that Rosa is pregnant. Sixteen years later, in \"The After Years\", Cecil and Rosa have a son named Ceodore. During an invasion of Baron, Cecil is defeated and possessed by the summoner Maenad, and his friends are forced to fight him to free him from the Maenad's control, though Cecil is left weakened afterwards.

Like Cecil, Kain notices the King of Baron's unusually harsh behavior, but he is under the mind-control of Golbez, and thus becomes Cecil's enemy. Kain eventually breaks free of Golbez's control after Tellah weakens Golbez. At this point, Kain joins Cecil's group in their efforts to defeat Golbez. However, after Cecil claims the last Dark Crystal, Golbez resumes his control of Kain. When Zemus' mind-control of Golbez breaks, Kain is released and helps Cecil's group destroy Zemus.

Afterwards, Cecil saves Rosa, and she helps them defeat the Lord of Wind, Barbariccia. Immediately after this, Rosa uses her magic to teleport them out of the unstable tower and she remains in the party for the rest of the game. At the end of the game, she marries Cecil and becomes the Queen of Baron.\n\nAfter marrying Cecil, Rosa has a son named Ceodore; her pregnancy causes her absence from most of \"Interlude\". In \"The After Years\", she is kidnapped by Kain's dark self. Once back to safety, Rosa joins her old friends as they fight to save their world from the threat of the True Moon.

Rydia becomes enraged when she learns of their actions, using Titan to cause an earthquake that separates them, but injuring herself in the process. Cecil takes her to Kaipo, and when she regains her senses, she initially cannot forgive him, although she does agree to join him after he defends her from some Baron soldiers. Later, Rydia is swallowed by the Eidolon Leviathan and taken to the Feymarch, the Land of the Eidolons which Leviathan rules alongside his Queen, Ashura. Due to the different flow of time in the Feymarch, she physically matures during her stay despite being gone only a short time in the real world. Having mastered summoning and black magic at the expense of white magic, she saves Cecil from Golbez's Shadow Dragon in the Dwarven Castle's Crystal Room and rejoins the party for the rest of the story. At the end of the game, she returns to the Land of Eidolons.\n\nDuring \"Interlude\", Rydia is impersonated by a mysterious summoner that attacks Cecil and his friends.

Along the way, he meets and befriends Cecil and Rydia. Upon reaching Damcyan, he learns Anna, his daughter, has sacrificed her life to save Edward from Golbez. When Tellah learns how deeply Edward had cared for Anna, his anger towards him lessens and he vows to kill Golbez, leaving Cecil's group. During his quest, he realizes that his current powers are not enough to accomplish this goal, so he travels to Mt. Ordeals where his memories return and he regains his mastery over magic. He also learns the forbidden spell, Meteor. Rejoining Cecil to confront Golbez, Tellah casts Meteor. Doing so weakens Golbez, but it kills Tellah. In the final moments of his life, Tellah admits to Cecil that his thirst for vengeance had consumed him.\n\nHe briefly reappears as a spirit in \"The After Years\", alongside Anna, advising Edward to not let his heart be weighed down by their deaths and encouraging him to come to Harley's aid.\n\nTellah is voiced by Gorō Naya in Japanese and Doug Lee in English.\n\nEdward Chris von Muir, known in the Japanese version of the game as , is the prince of Damcyan, soon to become the seventh king of the region.

While Fusoya and Golbez defeat Zemus' physical form easily, just as Cecil's group arrives Zemus transforms into Zeromus, a being formed from Zemus' intense hatred. Zeromus defeats Fusoya and Golbez, but is then vanquished by Cecil's group. Fusoya then returns to his sleep with Golbez and the rest of the Lunarians.\n\nIn \"The After Years\", Fusoya works with Golbez to investigate the arrival of the Maenads, but he is forced to send Golbez away to the Blue Planet while he defends the moon from the revived Zeromus. His fate is left unrevealed.\n\nHe is voiced by Banjō Ginga in Japanese and Michael McConnohie in English.\n\n is a sorcerer who pursues the Crystals around the world using Baron's forces, attacking multiple innocent people in the process. In reality, he is Cecil's older brother who has been under the control of Zemus from the day his parents died; his father beaten by the people he tried to help and his mother dying after giving birth to Cecil. Taking Cecil's place as the captain of the Red Wings, Golbez is a powerful opponent who serves as the main antagonist for the majority of the game. Seemingly affiliated with King Baron, Golbez brainwashes Kain to assist him. Upon recovering his true self while fighting Fusoya, he attempts to defeat Zemus, but fails. Once Cecil's group defeats Zemus, lacking the heart to return to the Blue Planet with the others, Golbez decides to remain on the moon with the Lunarians.\n\nGolbez returns in \"The After Years\". In his own storyline, he and Fusoya investigate the arrival of the Maenads, who shatter the moon's crystals and in doing so revive Zeromus. Fusoya sends Golbez down to the Blue Planet as he continues to fight Zeromus alone, and Golbez, under the identity of the , joins Rydia to help her save her friends. Later in the True Moon, Golbez comes face-to-face with Cecil's alterego the Dark Knight, who desires Golbez killed for both nearly destroying the world and abandoning his brother. With help from Rosa and Ceodore, Golbez stands up to his past sins and begs for forgiveness, allowing Cecil to regain his own strength and banish his dark half. Should Golbez survive, he remains with the party until the end of the game, at which point he returns to the moon in hopes that Fusoya or anybody else is still alive.\n\nHe has also been featured in all three \"Dissidia Final Fantasy\" titles as a playable character. He is voiced by Takeshi Kaga in Japanese and Peter Beckman in English. According to Takashi Tokita, one of the writers for \"Final Fantasy IV\", Golbez was created as an homage to the \"Star Wars\" saga villain Darth Vader.\n\n is the mastermind behind Golbez's actions in \"Final Fantasy IV\". Wishing to destroy the planet, he manipulates Golbez into carrying out his will in hunting down the Crystals. Fusoya reveals that Zemus is the only Lunarian who refused to go into stasis until the time when Lunarians and Earthlings could live in harmony. Even though Golbez and Fusoya seemingly vanquish him, Zemus comes back to life as , the monstrous embodiment of his hatred and evil. Cecil and his friends use a Crystal to reveal the true shape of Zeromus, and manage to slay him.\n\nZeromus returns in \"The After Years\" as Zeromus' Malice, which the Maenads unleash on the Lunarian's Moon by shattering the Crystals there. Fusoya and Golbez attempt to stop Zeromus, but he proves too strong and Fusoya is forced to send Golbez to the Blue Planet alone in order to protect it from the Maenads. The final fate of Fusoya and Zeromus is left unrevealed.\n\nA different version of Zeromus is fought in the \"Easytype\" version of \"Final Fantasy IV\", with a different graphic and attacks. It later appears in the Game Boy Advance and PlayStation Portable versions as the final boss of the new Lunar Ruins dungeon, named Zeromus EG. Zeromus is also an optional esper in \"Final Fantasy XII\", combining the Zeromus and Zeromus EG designs. He is voiced by Ryō Horikawa in Japanese and Michael McConnohie in English.\n\n (Rubicant in the original SNES release and PlayStation re-release) is the leader and strongest member of the Four Elemental Lords. The Lord of Fire, he is working with Dr. Lugae to raise the Giant of Babel, and is the archenemy of Edge. Cecil and Edge defeat Rubicante in the Tower of Babel and the Giant of Babel. Unlike the other Lords, he is very honorable, going so far as to heal Cecil's party before fighting them. He later advises Edge not to let his anger get the best of him, as it will merely blind him. He did not authorize Lugae's transformation of Edge's parents into monsters, and he apologizes to Edge for the deed before they fight. The party faces him again within the Giant of Babel.\n\nRubicante also appears in \"Final Fantasy: Dawn of Souls\", in the final level of Hellfire Chasm. In \"The After Years\", Rubicante is revived by the True Moons, in which he once again proves his honor to Cecil and his party. He is voiced by Norio Wakamoto in Japanese and Doug Lee in English.\n\n (Valvalis in the original SNES release and PlayStation re-release) is the only female member of the Four Elemental Lords. The Lord of Wind, Barbariccia can transform herself into an almost indestructible tornado. Cecil's party first defeat Barbariccia in the Tower of Zot, and again inside the Giant of Babel.\n\nShe also appears as an optional boss in \"Final Fantasy: Dawn of Souls\" on the final level of Hellfire Chasm, and is one of the revived Lords in \"The After Years\". She is voiced by Yūko Kaida in Japanese and Karen Strassman in English.\n\n (Kainazzo in the original SNES release) is the Lord of Water. He is a large turtle demon with a humanoid face, hired by Golbez and Zemus. Cagnazzo killed King Baron and impersonated him. It was in fact Cagnazzo that ordered Cecil to steal the Water Crystal from Mysidia and bomb the village of Mist. He was also responsible for imprisoning Cid after he would not divulge the location of his hidden airship. The initial battle with Cagnazzo is fought in the throne room of Baron. His battle tactics primarily consists of drawing water around him to unleash a powerful tsunami, although when struck by lightning, Cagnazzo will retreat into his shell and attempt to restore his lost health. Upon his defeat, he attempts one final attempt at killing the party by crushing them between the walls of the antechamber to the King's throne room, but this is foiled by the sacrifice of Palom and Porom. He later joins the other Lords in a final battle against Cecil and his friends in the Giant of Babel.\n\nHe also appears in \"Dawn of Souls\" on the fifth level of Hellfire Chasm. In \"The After Years\", he is revived inside the True Moon. He is voiced by Takeshi Aono in Japanese and Michael McConnohie in English.\n\n (Milon in the original SNES release and PlayStation re-release) is the Lord of Earth who first meets Cecil's group on Mt. Ordeals. Scarmiglione first appears as a small cloaked figure. Though Cecil thinks that he has defeated Scarmiglione and his zombie minions, the Earth Lord soon transforms into a hunched, zombie-like beast, attacking the group from behind. Even though Cecil and his allies believe that Scarmiglione had been destroyed as he fell off a bridge at the summit of Mt. Ordeals, he faces the Lord once again in the Giant of Babel.\n\nBoth of his forms appear in \"Dawn of Souls\" on the fifth level of Hellfire Chasm and in \"The After Years\" as a revived guardian of the True Moon. He is voiced by Konishi Ōnishi in Japanese and Dameon Clarke in English.\n\nDr. Lugae is a mad scientist working for Rubicante. He is the self-proclaimed \"brains behind Golbez's operation\" and he turns Edge's parents into monsters even though Rubicante never gave him permission to do so. His bodyguard and master creation is Barnabas (バルナバ, \"Barunaba\") (Balnab in the original SNES release). Should Barnabas become damaged enough to warrant the concern of Dr. Lugae, he will apply oil, and eventually mount the monster as a last resort, combining their powers. If Lugae is defeated before the player destroys Barnabas, then Barnabas will explode, damaging the party. Lugae later transforms into a cyborg-like creature with advanced weaponry.\n\nHe reappears in \"The After Years\" as a revived guardian of the True Moon.\n\n is a knight of Baron. He is a good friend of Cecil — although like Kain, he joins Golbez and the King in their army of evil. When the party sneaks into the seemingly vacant castle through the Watery Passage, he is the first apparently friendly face to greet them. However, the twins Palom and Porom smell \"something fishy\", and Baigan reveals his true self, telling the party that he was given the gift of his alternate form by Golbez. He is subsequently killed by Cecil's group.\n\nHe reappears in \"The After Years\" as a revived guardian of the True Moon.\n\n is the daughter of Tellah and is engaged to Prince Edward of Damcyan. After the death of Anna's mother, Tellah became overly protective of Anna, in the hopes of never losing her. When he learns of Anna's elopement with Edward, Tellah becomes furious and sets out after her. In Baron's raid on Damcyan, Anna is killed saving Edward's life. Edward later meets Anna's spirit in Kaipo, where she assuages his fears.\n\nShe is voiced by Hitomi Akino in Japanese and Zarah Little in English.\n\nThe Elder of Mysidia is the trainer of Palom, Porom, and the other mages of the town. A friend of Tellah, the Elder orders Palom and Porom to spy on Cecil when he heads to Mt. Ordeals. When Cecil becomes a paladin, the Elder realizes he is trustworthy, and becomes his ally. Later, the Elder, along with Palom and Porom, directs the prayers of the world to Cecil before the final battle against Zeromus.\n\nIn \"The After Years\", the Elder offers much advice to Porom before she leaves to join the fight for the Blue Planet.\n\nAs both Cecil and Kain were orphaned at very young ages, King Baron took them in and raised them as his own. While he wished for both to become Dark Knights, Kain wanted to train as a Dragoon, like his father. King Baron is killed by Cagnazzo though his spirit remained trapped in a secret second throne room of Baron Castle. When it is released, he is reincarnated as the Eidolon, Odin.\n\n, or King Giotto in the Japanese version, is the King of the Dwarves. Though the \"Enterprise\" gets caught in the crossfire between the Red Wings and Giott's tanks, the dwarves soon befriend Cecil and the rest of the party. King Giott provides much of the insight on the Dark Crystals of the Underworld. In all his kingdom, Giott's most prized treasure is his only child, his daughter Luca. After his wife's death, he gave his wife's necklace to Luca. The necklace is needed to open the Sealed Cavern, so Cecil and his party can stop Golbez from obtaining the final Dark Crystal.\n\nHe is voiced by Takeshi Aono.\n\nLuca is the daughter of King Giott and princess of the Dwarves. She is most notable as the creator of two mechanical dolls, Calca and Brina, which Golbez turns into a monster called Calcabrina that attacks the party. At first Luca seems untrusting of Cecil, but like the other dwarves, she learns to accept them. Under the rule of Luca and her father, the Dwarves help assist the party in their battles in the Underworld.\n\nLuca is a playable character in \"The After Years\". She is Cid's apprentice, mastering the skills of airship steering and maintenance, and joins the party in Rydia's chapter along with her two dolls.\n\nShe is voiced by Naomi Orikasa.\n\n is the protagonist of \"The After Years\", the son of Cecil and Rosa, and the prince of Baron. He is an apprentice knight who has no confidence in himself, as he fears he will never be able to step out from the shadow of his parents. When his family disappears, Ceodore goes on a quest to find them and eventually joins forces with others to fight against the Maenad. He is trained in swords and lances, and can also tap into his inner energy to temporarily enhance his strength.\n\nUrsula Fang Leiden is a supporting character in \"The After Years\". She is Yang's daughter, a childhood friend of Ceodore, and his godsister. Unlike Ceodore, she takes great pride in being Yang's daughter and the princess of Fabul, and knows no better way of expressing this than by training as a monk herself, which frustrates her father greatly: the two often quarrel since Yang does not want her to be a monk. However, when he sees how she has developed, and that she understands what it means to be a monk, he gives in. Ursula continues to aid her friends as the battle for the Blue Planet leads them to the True Moon.\n\nLeonora is a supporting character in \"The After Years\". She is an Epopt from the kingdom of Troia who is sent to be trained as a Sage. Palom is chosen as her teacher in Black Magic, and though Palom's brashness conflicts with Leonora's shyness, the two slowly begin to open up to each other. It is later revealed that Leonora had always looked up to Palom since she was a little girl listening to his stories about his adventures with Cecil, and their friendship grows stronger as they travel to the True Moon. Like Tellah in the previous game, Leonora can use both White and Black Magic, though she does not have the same strengths as those who specialize in one or the other.\n\nThe Eblan Four are a group of ninjas who serve under Edge: Gekkou, Izayoi, Tsukinowa, and Zangetsu. During the events of \"The After Years\", Edge sends each of the four on a reconnaissance mission around the world before meeting up with them later in the storyline. Should any of the four die during their mission, they will not rejoin Edge and thus will not become party members during the final assault on the True Moon.\n\nHarley is Edward's personal secretary and an aspiring scholar. In \"The After Years\", Harley is first found investigating a meteor landing and is helped by Edward. Later, Harley is stricken by desert fever while she and Edward are traveling to Baron to meet with Cecil, and Edward is disheartened at his inability to protect anybody until the spirits of Anna and Tellah tell him to not grieve for his losses and to find what his heart truly wants. Encouraged, Edward retrieves a Sand Pearl to cure Harley, and she continues to aid Edward as they journey to the True Moon with the rest of the party.\n\nHarley is briefly seen in \"Interlude\" as Edward's secretary-in-training.\n\nThe Maenad, initially only known as the Mysterious Girl, is a strange being with summoner powers encountered in \"Interlude\" and \"The After Years\". In the first of the two, she impersonates Rydia and causes trouble for Cecil and his friends. She is defeated by Cecil, Edge, Cid, Palom and Porom with the real Rydia's assistance but she escapes from them. In the second game, she first appears in Baron Castle where she defeats Cecil and brainwashes him. She later plays a cruel trick on Ceodore, forcing Cecil to fight him for her own amusement. She regards humans as lower life forms than herself and therefore has no qualms about hurting them physically or psychologically.\n\nIt is later revealed inside the True Moon that the Maenad is not a singular entity. There are many Maenads brought into being by the true antagonist of \"The After Years\": The Creator. These beings were born to retrieve the Crystals for their father. It is implied that they also receive their summoning abilities from him, as their powers are not how a summoner's powers usually work: the Maenads overwrite the Code of the Eidolons by trapping them in another dimension and forcing them to serve their will, and by extension, The Creator's.\n\nBefore meeting the Creator, the party encounters a child Maenad who opens the passage to his chambers. When the Creator begins to destroy the True Moon after being defeated, the party rescues the child as they escape, and the other Maenads protect them from the Creator by stating \"that child is our future\". In the ending, it is revealed that Rydia has adopted the child Maenad and named her Cuore, and she is raising her with help from Edge and the Mist villagers.\n\nThe Creator is the name given to the primary antagonist of \"The After Years\". The driving force behind the Maenads, he is the last survivor of a mysterious race that prospered too greatly, causing them to destroy their own planet. He has embarked upon a lifetime's experimentation using the Crystals to learn where his kind went wrong, however, somewhere along the way, he decided that the universe should not be overrun with inferior races, and programmed his ship, the True Moon, to consume the planets of races that do not live up to his expectations.\n\nHe has the ability to create Crystals, which he uses to record data on various races, and later on the True Moon to summon demons from Cecil's past and from other worlds (the worlds of \"Final Fantasy I\", \"II\", \"III\", \"V\", and \"VI\") to attack the party. He ends up inadvertently showing the party what laid his kind low: as they prospered, so too did the evil within them, but while the people of the Blue Planet worked to contain the damage done by their inner demons, the Creator's race did not do anything like this. Using their planet's Crystals, the party draws out and destroys the darkness within him, causing him to become unstable and destroy the True Moon. He is then killed by the Maenads as the party flees from his lair with a child Maenad in tow, his last words being an expression of gratitude towards them for what they have done.\n\nThe cast of \"Final Fantasy IV\" has been well received by video game publications. GameTrailers stated that by the time the game was first released, the characters surpassed common RPG stereotypes, and that the relationships between the main cast would still entertain gamers a decade later. \"Dragon\" reviewer Sandy Petersen added that the cast was notable for each having their motives in the plot which attached him to the game. The diverse number of characters has been praised for their distinctive traits by RPGFan's Matt Rickert. Greg Kasavin from GameSpot had similar comments, and appreciated that unlike other RPG protagonists, Cecil was already an experienced warrior at the start of the game and had strong relationships already established. Similarly, Micky Gunn from GamePlanet stated that thanks to the characters' expertise, the player had access to a wide variety of moves from the game's beginning.\n\nCecil was listed as the best hero in the \"Final Fantasy\" franchise by GamesRadar as well as one of the top 10 franchise characters by GameZone, owing to his heroic traits and character arc. Both GameSpot and IGN stated that the cast was interesting and avoided common cliches. On the other hand, while RPGamer's Michael Beckett found the main characters likable, he felt that some of the most important ones \"have been copied by so many other titles in the genre that they have been rendered cliche,\" specifically pointing to Cecil and Rosa's personalities.\n\nThe designs from the Nintendo DS remake were praised by Elisa Di Fiore from GameSpy as making the characters appealing, while Cheat Code Central complained that some were too pixelated. The inclusion of English voice actors in the Nintendo DS remake resulted in positive reactions from RPGamer's Glenn Wilson, who stated that the actors \"emote well and add to the believability of the characters,\" while Elisa Di Fiore stated it made the characters more enjoyable. Lark Anderson from GameSpot instead said the acting was \"weak\", stating it made some scenes overdramatic. Cheat Code Central enjoyed the voice acting but felt it could have been better.\n\nManga author Masashi Kishimoto cited the cast as likable and expressed a preference for both Palom and Porom and their scenes.\n"}

The Court has, however, never come into existence because the African Union has decided that it should be merged with the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights to form a new court: the African Court of Justice and Human Rights (ACJHR). Underlying this decision was the concern at the growing number of AU institutions, which the AU could not afford to support.\n\nA protocol to set up the Court of Justice was adopted in 2003, and entered into force in 2009. It was, however, superseded by a protocol creating the African Court of Justice and Human Rights.\n\nThe merger protocol was adopted during the 11th African Union Summit in July 2008.

{"id": "2270378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270378", "title": "Reconquista (Mexico)", "text": "Reconquista (Mexico)\n\nThe Reconquista (\"reconquest\") is a term that is used (not exclusively) to describe the vision by different individuals, groups, and/or nations that the Southwestern United States should be politically or culturally reconquered by Mexico. These opinions are often formed on the basis that those territories had been claimed by Spain for centuries and had been claimed by Mexico from 1821 until being ceded to the United States in the Texas annexation (1845) and the Mexican Cession (1848), as a consequence of the Mexican–American War.\n\nThe term \"Reconquista\" means \"reconquest\", and is an analogy to the Christian Reconquista of Moorish Iberia, as the areas of greatest Mexican immigration and cultural diffusion are conterminous with the territories the United States gained from Mexico in the 19th century.\n\nIn a 2001 article on Latin American web portal Terra entitled \"Advancement of the Spanish language and Hispanics is like a Reconquista (Reconquest)\", Elena Poniatowska said:\n\nIn his keynote address at the Second International Congress of the Spanish language held in Valladolid, Spain, in 2003 entitled \"Unity and Diversity of Spanish, Language of Encounters\", with regards to \"reconquista\", Carlos Fuentes said:\n\nIn another part of his discourse, Fuentes briefly returns to his idea of \"reconquista\":\n\nThus, Poniatowska and Fuentes' concept of reconquista can be viewed as a metaphor for the linguistic tendencies by a diverse group of peoples who share a common and historical connection to the Spanish language within the Americas over the course of 500 years, which, incidentally, includes the border region of the Southwest United States.\n\nThe fringe group Nationalist Front of Mexico opposes what it sees as Anglo-American cultural influences and rejects the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, as well as what its members consider the \"American occupation\" of territory formerly belonging to Mexico and now form the southwestern United States.\n\nOn its website, the front states:\nWe reject the occupation of our nation in its northern territories, an important cause of poverty and emigration. We demand that our claim to all the territories occupied by force by the United States be recognized in our Constitution, and we will bravely defend, according to the principle of self-determination to all peoples, the right of the Mexican people to live in the whole of our territory within its historical borders, as they existed and were recognized at the moment of our independence.\nA prominent advocate of \"Reconquista\" was Chicano activist and adjunct professor Charles Truxillo (1953–2015) of the University of New Mexico (UNM), who envisioned a sovereign Hispanic nation called the \"República del Norte\" (Republic of the North) that would encompass Northern Mexico, Baja California, California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. He supported the secession of US Southwestern states to form an independent Chicano nation, arguing that the Articles of Confederation gave individual states full sovereignty and thus the legal right to secede.\nTruxillo, who taught at UNM's Chicano Studies Program on a yearly contract, suggested in an interview that \"Native-born American Hispanics feel like strangers in their own land.\" He said, \"We remain subordinated. We have a negative image of our own culture, created by the media. Self-loathing is a terrible form of oppression. The long history of oppression and subordination has to end\" and that on both sides of the US–Mexico border \"there is a growing fusion, a reviving of connections ... Southwest Chicanos and Norteno Mexicanos are becoming one people again.\" Truxillo stated that Hispanics who have achieved positions of power or otherwise are \"enjoying the benefits of assimilation\" are most likely to oppose a new nation, explaining that\n\nTruxillo believed that the \"República del Norte\" would be brought into existence by \"any means necessary\" but that it was unlikely to be formed by civil war but rather by the electoral pressure of the future majority Hispanic population in the region. Truxillo added that he believed it's his job to help develop a \"cadre of intellectuals\" to think about how this new state can become a reality.\nIn 2007, the UNM reportedly decided to stop renewing Truxillo's yearly contract. Truxillo claimed that his \"firing\" was due to his radical beliefs, arguing that \"Tenure is based on a vote from my colleagues. Few are in favor of a Chicano professor advocating a Chicano nation state.\"\n\nIn an interview with \"In Search of Aztlán\" on 8 August 1999, José Ángel Gutiérrez, a political science professor at the University of Texas at Arlington, stated that: \nIn an interview with the \"Star-Telegram\" in October 2000, Gutiérrez stated that many recent Mexican immigrants \"want to recreate all of Mexico and join all of Mexico into one. And they are going to do that, even if it's just demographically ... They are going to have political sovereignty over the Southwest and many parts of the Midwest.\" In a videotape made by the Immigration Watchdog website (as cited in \"The Washington Times\"), Gutiérrez is quoted as saying, \"We are millions. We just have to survive. We have an aging white America. They are not making babies. They are dying. It's a matter of time. The explosion is in our population.\" In a subsequent interview with \"The Washington Times\" in 2006, Gutiérrez backtracked and said there was \"no viable\" \"Reconquista\" movement, and blamed interest in the issue on closed-border groups and \"right-wing blogs\".\n\nFelipe Gonzáles, a professor at the University of New Mexico (UNM), who is director of UNM's Southwest Hispanic Research Institute, has stated that while there is a \"certain homeland undercurrent\" among New Mexico Hispanics, the \"educated elites are going to have to pick up on this idea [of a new nation] and run with it and use it as a point of confrontation if it is to succeed.\" Juan José Peña of the Hispano Round Table of New Mexico believes that Mexicans and Mexican Americans currently lack the political consciousness to form a separate nation, stating that \"Right now, there's no movement capable of undertaking it.\"\n\nIllegal immigration into the southwest states is sometimes viewed as a form of \"reconquista\", in light of the fact that Texas statehood was preceded by an influx of US settlers into that Mexican province until United States citizens outnumbered Mexicans 10–1 and were able to take over governance of the area. The theory is that the reverse will happen as Mexicans eventually become so numerous in that region that they can wield substantial influence, including political power. Even if not intended, some analysts say the significant demographic shift in the American Southwest may result in \"a de facto reconquista.\"\n\nA May 2006 Zogby poll reported that 58 percent of Mexicans believe that the southwestern US belongs to Mexico.\n\nThe American political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, a proponent of the widespread popularity of Reconquista, stated in 2004 that:\nThe neoliberal political writer Mickey Kaus has remarked,\nOther Hispanic rights leaders say that \"Reconquista\" is nothing more than a fringe movement. Nativo Lopez, president of the Mexican American Political Association in Los Angeles, when asked about the concept of \"Reconquista\" by a reporter, responded \"I can't believe you're bothering me with questions about this. You're not serious. I can't believe you're bothering with such a minuscule, fringe element that has no resonance with this populace.\"\n\n\"Reconquista\" sentiments are often jocularly referred to by media targeted to Mexicans, including a recent Absolut Vodka ad that generated significant controversy in the United States for its printing of a map of pre–Mexican–American war Mexico. \"Reconquista\" is a recurring theme in contemporary fiction and non-fiction, particularly among far-right authors.\n\nThe National Council of La Raza, the largest national Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization in the United States, has stated on its website that it \"has never supported and does not endorse the notion of a \"Reconquista\" (the right of Mexico to reclaim land in the southwestern United States) or \"Aztlán.\"\"\n\nIn an editorial written in \"Investor's Business Daily\", it said efforts by past Mexican government officials to influence the 2016 election was a form of \"reconquista\". This view was not shared in an editorial in the \"American Thinker\", which pointed towards Californio independence from Mexico in the mid-19th century.\n\nIn 1915, the capture of Basilio Ramos (an alleged supporter of the Mexican dictator Victoriano Huerta) in Brownsville, Texas, revealed the existence of the Plan of San Diego, which stated goal was to reconquer the southwestern United States in order to gain domestic support in Mexico for Huerta. However, other theories point that \"the plan\" was created to push the US into supporting Venustiano Carranza, a major leader of the Mexican revolution (which ultimately occurred).\n\nIn 1917, according to the intercepted Zimmermann Telegram, in exchange for joining Germany as an ally against the United States during World War I, Germany was ready to assist Mexico to \"reconquer\" its lost territories of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.\n\nFor Chicanos in the 1960s, the term, although not invoked, was understood as taking back \"Aztlán\", by spray painting as many Mexican images as they could on any wall or sign they could find.\n\nIn the late 1990s to early 2000s, as US census data showed that the population of Mexican Americans in the Southwestern United States had increased, the term was popularized by contemporary Mexican intellectuals, such as Carlos Fuentes, Elena Poniatowska, and President Vicente Fox, who spoke of Mexican immigrants maintaining their culture and Spanish language in the United States as they migrated in greater numbers to this area.\n\nIn March 2015, at the midst of the War in Ukraine, when the US was planning on supporting Ukraine to fight against Russia, , the speaker of the Chechen parliament, threatened to arm Mexico against the United States and questioned the legal status of the territories of California, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Colorado and Wyoming.\n\n"}

{"id": "2270393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270393", "title": "Fariduddin Ganjshakar", "text": "Fariduddin Ganjshakar\n\nFarīd al-Dīn Masʿūd Ganj-i-Shakar (c. 4 April 1179 – 7 May 1266) was a 12th-century Punjabi Muslim preacher and mystic. who went on to become \"one of the most revered and distinguished ... Muslim mystics\" of the medieval period. He is known reverentially as Bābā Farīd or Shaikh Farīd by Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus of the Punjab Region, or simply as Farīduddīn Ganjshakar.\n\nFariduddin Masud was born some time in 571 A.H. (1175 A.D.) at a village called Kothewal, 10 km from Multan in the Punjab region of what is now Pakistan, to Jamāl-ud-dīn Suleimān and Maryam Bībī (Qarsum Bībī), daughter of Sheikh Wajīh-ud-dīn Khojendī. He was a Sunni Muslim and was one of the founding fathers of the Chishti Sufi order.\nBaba Farid received his early education at Multan, which had become a centre for Muslim education; it was there that he met his teacher Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki, a noted Sufi saint, who was passing through Multan on his way from Baghdad to Delhi. Upon completing his education, Farīd left for Sistan and Kandahar and went to Makkah for the Hajj pilgrimage with his parents at the age of 16.\n\nOnce his education was over, he moved to Delhi, where he learned the Islamic doctrine from his master, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki. He later moved to Hansi, Haryana. When Quṭbuddīn Bakhtiyār Kākī died in 1235, Farīd left Hansi and became his spiritual successor, and he settled in Ajodhan (the present Pakpattan, Pakistan) instead of Delhi. On his way to Ajodhan, while passing through Faridkot, he met the 20-year-old Nizamuddin Auliya, who went on to become his disciple, and later his successor Sufi khalīfah. In Faridkot, while working as a labourer in building a fort of the Raja of Faridkot. The Raja received his blessings once the Raja realised who he was as he was able to carry bricks over head without the bricks touching him. The Raja immediately saw the divinity in him and requested to become his follower. The Raja and his descendants dedicate many shrines in his memory. His nephew and disciple and successor Alauddin Sabir Kaliyari was amongst the greatest Sufi saints and from him Sabiriya branch under Chisty order started.\n\nBaba Farid had three wives and eight children (five sons and three daughters). One of his wives, Hazabara, was the daughter of Sulṭān Nasīruddīn Maḥmūd.\n\nThe great Arab traveller Ibn Battuta once visited this Sufi saint. Ibn Battuta says that Fariduddin Ganjshakar was the spiritual guide of the Sultan of Delhi Sultanate, and that the Sultan had given him the village of Ajodhan. He also met Baba Farid's two sons.\n\nBaba Farid's descendants, also known as Fareedi, Fareedies or Faridy, mostly carry the name Fārūqī, and can be found in Pakistan, India and the diaspora. Fariduddin Ganjshakar's descendants include the Sufi saint Salim Chishti, whose daughter was the Emperor Jehangir's foster mother. Their descendants settled in Sheikhupur, Badaun and the remains of a fort they built can still be found. Baba Farid also visited Budaun during Iltutmish period to meet Sultan-ul-Aarfeen Khwaja Syed Hasan Sheikh Shahi Rehmatullah, Bade Sarkar.\nOne of his descendants was the noted Sufi scholar Muhibbullah Allahabadi (1587–1648).\n\nFariduddin Ganjshakar's shrine darbār is located in Pakpattan, Punjab, Pakistan.\n\nBaba Farīd spiritual lineage of Chishti Order\n\nOne of Farīd's most important contributions to Punjabi literature was his development of the language for literary purposes. Whereas Sanskrit, Arabic, Turkish and Persian had historically been considered the languages of the learned and the elite, and used in monastic centres, Punjabi was generally considered a less refined folk language. Although earlier poets had written in a primitive Punjabi, before Farīd there was little in Punjabi literature apart from traditional and anonymous ballads. By using Punjabi as the language of poetry, Farīd laid the basis for a vernacular Punjabi literature that would be developed later.\n\nThe city of Faridkot bears his name. According to legend, Farīd stopped by the city, then named Mokhalpūr, and sat in seclusion for forty days near the fort of King Mokhal. The king was said to be so impressed by his presence that he named the city after Baba Farid, which today is known as \"Tilla Baba Farid\". The festival Bābā Sheikh Farād Āgman Purb Melā' is celebrated in September each year from (21–23 Sep, for 3 days), commemorating his arrival in the city. Ajodhan was also renamed as Farīd's 'Pāk Pattan', meaning 'Holy Ferry'; today it is generally called Pāk Pattan Sharīf.\n\nFaridia Islamic University, a religious madrassa in Sahiwal, Punjab, Pakistan, is named after him, and in July 1998, the Punjab Government in India established the Baba Farid University of Health Sciences at Faridkot, the city which itself was named after him.\n\nThere are various explanations of why Baba Farid was given the title Shakar Ganj ('Treasure of Sugar'). One legend says his mother used to encourage the young Farīd to pray by placing sugar under his prayer mat. Once, when she forgot, the young Farīd found the sugar anyway, an experience that gave him more spiritual fervour and led to his being given the name.\n\nThe small Shrine of Baba Farid is made of white marble with two doors, one facing east and called the Nūrī Darwāza or 'Gate of Light', and the second facing north called Bahishtī Darwāza, or 'Gate of Paradise'. There is also a long covered corridor. Inside the tomb are two white marbled graves. One is Baba Farid's, and the other is his elder son's. These graves are always covered by sheets of cloth called \"Chaddars\"' (the green coloured chaddars are covered with Islamic verses), and flowers that are brought by visitors. The space inside the tomb is limited; not more than ten people can be inside at one time. Ladies are not allowed inside the tomb, but the late Benazir Bhutto, then Prime Minister of Pakistan, was permitted to enter inside by the shrine guardians, when she visited the shrine. Another rare exceptional case was the late Hajjah Kainz Hussain of Jhelum, wife of the late Haji Manzoor Hussain, who was allowed inside the tomb and was given a \"Chaddar\". \n\nCharity food called \"Langar\" is distributed all day to visitors here and the Auqaf Department, which administers the shrine. The shrine is open all day and night for visitors. The shrine has its own huge electricity generator that is used whenever there is power cut or loadshedding, so the shrine remains bright all night, all year round. There is no separation of male and female areas but a small female area is also available. There is a big new mosque in the shrine. Thousands of people daily visit the shrine for their wishes and unresolvable matters; for this they vow to give to some charity when their wishes or problems are resolved. When their matters are solved they bring charity food for visitors and the poor, and drop money in big money boxes that are kept for this purpose. This money is collected by the Auqaf Department of the Government of Pakistan that looks after the shrine.\n\nOn 25 October 2010, a bomb exploded outside the gates of the shrine, killing six people. Since then, the shrine surroundings and compound area has been renovated.\n\nIn great old holy city of Jerusalem, there is a place called \"Al-Hindi Serai\" or \"Indian hospice\" (Indian lodge or shrine), where it is claimed Baba Farid lived for many years in the early 13th century, almost 800 years ago. Baba Farid walked into Jerusalem around the year 1200, little more than a decade after the armies of Saladin had forced the Crusaders out of Jerusalem. The place is now a pilgrim lodge for people of the Indian sub-continent. It is claimed that this building is currently cared for by the 86-year-old caretaker, Muhammad Munir Ansari, in 2014. \"No one knows how long Baba Farid stayed in the city. But long after he had returned to the Punjab, where he eventually became head of the Chishti order, Indian Muslims passing through Jerusalem on their way to Mecca wanted to pray where he had prayed, to sleep where he had slept. Slowly, a shrine and pilgrim lodge, the Indian Hospice, formed around the memory of Baba Farid.\" \"Later accounts of his life said that he spent his days sweeping the stone floors around al-Aqsa mosque, or fasting in the silence of a cave inside the city walls.\"\n\nA chilla is also found on the top of hill of Donphin nose hill of Visakhapatnam port of Visakhapatnam city in which it is believed that Hazarat Baba Fareed spent some time here,and there is a vast banyan tree in the premises which used to shed sugar in Baba's honour\nEvery year, the saint's death anniversary or \"Urs\" is celebrated for six days in the first Islamic month of Muharram, in Pakpattan, Pakistan. The \"Bahishtī Darwāza\" (Gate of Paradise) is opened only once a year, during the time of the \"Urs\" fair. Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims and visitors from all over the country and the world come to pay homage. The door of the Bahishti Darwaza is made of silver, with floral designs inlaid in gold leaf. This \"Gate to Paradise\" is padlocked all year, and only opened for five days from sunset to sunrise in the month of Muharram. Some followers believe that by crossing this door all of one's sins are washed away. During the opening of the Gate of Paradise, extensive security arrangements are made to protect people from stampedes. In 2001, 27 people were crushed to death and 100 were injured in a stampede. The Urs is celebrated every year from the fifth through the tenth of Muharram. Some of his personal belongings were taken by his descendant Sheikh Salim Chishti, and kept in a fort built by his descendants in Sheikhupur, Badaun, where they are preserved in a conatiner called \"Pitari\". To this day it is taken out in a procession for the first six days of Muharram.\n\nOne of the significant features of the daily life of the shrine is Qawwali. It is performed all day at some part of the shrine, but at night it attracts a huge gathering. Every Thursday evening, there is a big Mehfil-e-Sama just outside the tomb, that lasts all night and attracts hundreds of people. Many famous and popular Qawwals (Qawwali singers) of the country participate in the Mehfil. Many listeners become so mesmerised that they start dancing a traditional religious dance called Dhamaal. The first Thursday evening of every lunar month attracts extra thousands of people, making the shrine jam packed.\n\nBaba Farid, as he is commonly known, has his poetry included in the \"Guru Granth Sahib\", the most sacred scripture of Sikhism, which includes 123 (or 134) hymns composed by Farid. Guru Arjan Dev Ji, the 5th guru of Sikhism, included these hymns himself in the \"Adi Granth\", the predecessor of the \"Guru Granth Sahib\". There are 10 Sikh gurus, but also there are 15 Bhagats in Sikhism. Baba Sheikh Farid is one of these equally revered 15 Bhagats. The town of Faridkot in Punjab, India is named after him.\n\nIn 1989, on the 800th birth anniversary of Baba Farid, the Pakistan Post Office issued a commemorative postage stamp in his honor.\n\n\n\n\n"}

All the main political blocs were included in it except for the Free Patriotic Movement-led bloc headed by General Michel Aoun. Hezbollah were firstly represented in this cabinet.\n\nThe legality of the government was questioned when five Shia members left in November 2006. The reason for their resignation was Siniora's eagerness to sign the UN draft plan for the foundation of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, which would search the assassination of Rafik Hariri, who was killed on 14 February 2005.\n\nOn 24 November 2007, the government became an interim one following the end of the president's mandate.

Its purpose is to remove any doubt as to the paternity of a child born after the divorce or death of the prior husband.\n\nThe length of ‘iddah varies according to a number of circumstances. Generally, the ‘iddah of a woman divorced by her husband is three monthly periods, but if the marriage was not consummated there is no ‘iddah. For a woman whose husband has died, the ‘iddah is four lunar months and ten days after the death of her husband, whether or not the marriage was consummated. If a woman is pregnant when she is widowed or divorced, the ‘iddah lasts until she gives birth. If the divorcee or widow does not menstruate, scholars say that she should observe an ‘iddah of a full year: nine months for pregnancy and three months for ‘iddah.\n\nIslamic scholars consider this directive to be a balance between mourning of husband's death and protecting the widow from criticism that she might be subjected to from remarrying too quickly after her husband’s death. This is also to ascertain whether a woman is pregnant or not, since four and a half months is half the length of a normal pregnancy.\n\nThe directive within the Quran (Al-Baqarah 2:234-235), regarding the waiting period for a widow, is:\n\nThe following is a summary of the main directives (for widows) contained in these verses:\n\nThese are the basic Sharia directives regarding the waiting period for a widow. It is also clear from another directive of the Quran that during this waiting period, the woman should not be turned out of her house.\n\nThe directive within the Quran (Al-Baqarah 2:228), regarding the waiting period for a divorcee, is:\n\nIn surah it is stated:\n\nIn the Quran surah At-Talaq Verse 65:4, it is stated:\n\nThe following is a summary of the main directives (for divorces) contained in these verses:\n\nAllah the Exalted clarifies the waiting period of the woman in menopause. And that is the one whose menstruation has stopped due to her older age. Her `Iddah is three months instead of the three monthly cycles for those who menstruate, which is based upon the Ayah in (Surat) Al-Baqarah. (see 2:228) The same for the young, who have not reached the years of menstruation. Their `Iddah is three months like those in menopause. (\"Quran Tafsir Ibn Kathir\")\n\nImam Suyuti's commentary, Tafsir al-Jalalayn: And as for those of your women who read allā’ī or allā’i in both instances no longer expect to menstruate if you have any doubts about their waiting period their prescribed waiting period shall be three months and also for those who have not yet menstruated because of their young age their period shall also be three months — both cases apply to other than those whose spouses have died; for these latter their period is prescribed in the verse they shall wait by themselves for four months and ten days.\nDivorced women and widows who are pregnant cannot remarry until delivery. Remarriage cannot take place until a period of waiting removes all doubt about any existing pregnancy.\n\nMuslim jurists and thinkers have generally construed this additional purpose entailed in the prescription of the waiting period for widows to be that of the widow's 'mourning' her deceased husband. The prescription of a specified 'waiting' or 'mourning' period is for the purpose of safeguarding the woman against defamation, slander and ill-repute in society.\nIn Pakistan, the waiting period for a divorcee is 90 days, and for a widow it is 130 days. However, pregnant divorcees or widows have to wait until birth or miscarriage occurs.\n\nIt is specifically for this purpose that others are directed against making a 'secret' commitment of marriage with the widow or deciding about the time and place of the marriage-contract, during the prescribed period. It is reported that Muhammad advised widows to be extra modest in their appearance and to even refrain from wearing any fragrance during this period. All these directives and advice seem to point to the fact that a woman should not only be, but also appear to be in a state of mourning, so that her social circles do not get a chance to say a negative word about her.\n\nNo other restrictions apply to a widow during her waiting period.\n\n"}
{"id": "2270411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270411", "title": "ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter", "text": "ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter\n\nThe ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter (often abbreviated Alien Encounter) was a \"theater-in-the-round\" attraction located in the Tomorrowland section of the Magic Kingdom theme park at Walt Disney World Resort. A co-production between Walt Disney Imagineering and Lucasfilm, the attraction was a darkly humorous science-fiction experience that used binaural sound to achieve many of its effects. A warning outside the attraction's entrance alerted guests that it was intense and not intended for children under the age of 12; however, its height requirement was just for guests.\n\nIt opened briefly for previews on December 16, 1994, on the site of the former Mission to Mars attraction, but was ordered closed on January 12, 1995, for retooling by then-Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who deemed it was not intense enough. It opened officially on June 20, 1995, as part of the Magic Kingdom's \"New Tomorrowland\" renovation. Upon its opening, some Disney fans praised ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter for its darker tone in contrast to other attractions at Magic Kingdom. It closed permanently on October 12, 2003. The attraction was replaced by Stitch's Great Escape!, which opened on November 16, 2004. It uses much of the same technology and set pieces from its predecessor.\n\nGuests were ushered into the \"Tomorrowland Interplanetary Convention Center\" (mentioned as such in the Tomorrowland Transit Authority narration) for a demonstration of new technology from an alien corporation known as \"X-S Tech\". The company's chairman, L.C. Clench (Jeffrey Jones), set the attraction's subtly sinister tone with a pre-show welcome that included his corporate philosophy, \"If something can't be done with X-S then it shouldn't be done at all.\"\n\nBefore the start of the pre-show, the television monitors described other events taking place at the Tomorrowland Interplanetary Convention Center, including \"The Tomorrowland Chamber of Commerce presents 'X-S Tech'\" (\"The galaxy's #1 authority in technological innovation invites you to experience its latest achievement\"), \"Mission to Mars: History or Hoax\" (a tribute to the attraction that previously occupied the Alien Encounter's space), \"Championship Pet Show\" (\"because when it comes to your space pet, what goes down must \"not\" come up\"), and \"The Walt Disney Company's Pan Galactic Stock Holders Meeting\" (featuring a holographic transmission from \"Lunar Disneyland—The Happiest Place Off Earth\").\n\nGuests proceeded into a second area where they were introduced to an X-S robot known as Simulated Intelligence Robotics, or S.I.R. for short, voiced by Tim Curry (originally called T.O.M. 2000, short for Technobotic Oratorical Mechanism series 2000, and voiced by Phil Hartman). He proceeded to demonstrate the company's \"practically painless\" teleportation technology using a cute little animatronic alien named Skippy. The creature's charred and disoriented appearance after being teleported a short distance across the room suggested the technology was flawed. While teleporting Skippy back across the room, S.I.R. paused the process, demonstrating how the technology could be used to suspend subjects in teleportation indefinitely.\n\nFinally, guests were seated in harnesses within a circular chamber surrounding an enormous plastic cylinder, the \"teleportation tube.\" Clench and two bumbling X-S Tech employees, Spinlok (Kevin Pollak) and Dr. Femus (Kathy Najimy), communicated \"live\" from across the galaxy via video screens. Initially, a single guest was to be teleported out of the chamber for a meeting with Clench. Instead, Clench was \"seized\" by inspiration and decided to have himself teleported into the chamber to meet the entire group.\n\nClench's impatience and the unexpected change of plans caused the teleportation signal to be diverted through an unknown planet. As a result; a towering, winged and carnivorous alien was beamed into the tube by mistake, as chaos and confusion ensued and the technicians panicked. The creature quickly escaped, however, as intermittent darkness and flashes of light revealed the shattered and empty teleportation tube. A power outage then plunged the chamber into total darkness as guests sat helplessly restrained in their seats. A maintenance worker attempted to restore the power, but was mauled as the alien's shrieks resounded throughout the room and a spray of fluid flew out into the audience hitting the guests' faces. After the spray of fluid, the guests felt their seats rumble and shake as the alien made its way swiftly through the crowd, during which time the guests also felt the \"breath\" of the alien on the back of their necks and drool dripping from its mouth.\n\nThe power finally came back, and with assistance from the two X-S Tech technicians, the ravenous alien was ultimately driven back into the broken teleportation device, but overpowering the tube caused the alien to explode right before the tube closed. Guests were then released from their seats while the two technicians bid them goodbye and resumed their search for the misplaced Clench. On the way out, guests could see the sign \"What a Way to Go\" and were wished \"a nice tomorrow\" and exited into Merchant of Venus.\n\nUnlike the Stitch-themed replacement show, much of Alien Encounter took place in total darkness while the attraction operated on the guests' non-visual senses. Most of the effects came from individual units mounted on the shoulder restraints behind audience members' heads. The most common effects were binaural cues which came from the highly separated speakers arranged next to each ear. These speakers bolstered many of the other effects with foley, creating unique effects like positional audio from the monster, and created general atmospherics to keep the audience tense, including the murmuring and screams of other audience members, pink noise, and heartbeats. The theater's circular design allowed these positional audio effects to be particularly effective, as it prevented individual guests from perceiving that their experiences were not unique.\n\nBinaural sound effects and moving shoulder restraints suggest that the alien is moving through the chamber above the audience. When the alien was meant to be traveling on the far side of the room, \"several banks of 1,800-watt-per-channel servo-driven subwoofers\" repurposed from the previous attraction, Mission to Mars, and transducers mounted in the seats made pounding vibrations meant to simulate the footsteps of a powerful monster. Warm moistened air was used gently, to simulate the alien breathing down your neck; and forcefully, to induce a more acute reaction from the audience. Water sprinklers and air blasters mounted in the row in front (like the ones used in Disney's \"4D\" movie theaters) were used to simulate the dripping of either the creature's drool or blood from an attacked worker in the scaffolding above the theater (played by a cast member carrying a flashlight using pre-recorded dialog) and to simulate the explosion of the monster in the finale when the blast shield does not close in time. Soft textile tubes had air blown through them, causing them to slap against the back of the head of the audience member. This was the most direct physical effect, used in conjunction with the hot air blowers and olfactory emitters to suggest the alien's tongue was licking the audience member's head.\n\nDuring lighted segments, the show used lasers, rear-projected screens repurposed from the previous attraction, Mission to Mars, and Audio-Animatronics for the alien, S.I.R., and Skippy (both normal and deformed).\n\nAlien Encounter was proposed for Disneyland for the project \"Tomorrowland 2055,\" as part of the \"Disney Decade,\" started by Michael Eisner. It was to be installed in the space that housed the attraction Mission to Mars. Also proposed to join \"Tomorrowland 2055\" were The Timekeeper, which was to take over Circlevision 360, and also \"Plectu's Fantastic Intergalactic Revue,\" a musical revue which was to land where America Sings once was located. Due to budget cuts from the Disneyland Paris opening, \"Tomorrowland 2055\" was scrapped.\n\nThe original name for this attraction was \"Nostromo\", a reference to the spacecraft from the 1979 movie \"Alien\". Furthermore, the monster was planned to be the titular creature, and \"X-S Tech\" was going to be the Weyland-Yutani Corporation. This idea was scrapped for two reasons: first, it was deemed too frightening for a Disney attraction. Second, the \"Alien\" series were rated R. This contradicted a rule-of-thumb that Disney attractions are supposed to be based on either G or PG. (However, Disney has since developed attractions from franchises that host at least one PG-13 rated film, such as \"Pirates of the Caribbean\", \"Star Wars\", \"Indiana Jones\", \"Marvel\", and \"Avatar\".) As a result, the name Nostromo was taken out entirely and an original monster was created for the ride and the fictional company was changed to \"X-S Tech\". Nevertheless, Disney had acquired the rights to use \"Alien\", and thusly used it in The Great Movie Ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios, which featured a scene aboard the \"Nostromo\" where a frightened Ripley hides behind a wall while the Xenomorph pops out of the walls and ceiling to growl at the audience.\n\nAs an original story was developed, George Lucas was brought in to work on the project. This version's storyline had X-S Tech's open house being a front for exposing human guinea pigs to an alien monster they had captured. After the alien menaces the audience for a moment, it is revealed to be sentient and desires to escape its captors and free the guests as well. The X-S scientists respond by trying to destroy the test chamber and leave no evidence, but the alien holds off their weaponry, raises the restraints allowing the guests to escape. While leaving, the sounds of the alien rampaging through the pre-show facilities could be heard. The story's grim tone would lead to it being further re-worked.\n\nTyra Banks (well known as the host of \"America's Got Talent\"), played the female alien who greets guests in the first preshow video, although her lines were voiced by another actress. Tim Curry voiced the Audio-Animatronic robot S.I.R. (Simulated Intelligence Robotics) in the second preshow area. In the original version, the character was named T.O.M. 2000, was voiced by Phil Hartman, and had a much more humorous script. Chairman L.C. Clench was portrayed by actor Jeffrey Jones. Dr. Femus is portrayed by actress Kathy Najimy, with Kevin Pollak playing her partner, Spinlock.\n\nA game within the DisneyQuest indoor interactive arcade at the Walt Disney World Resort called \"Invasion! An ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter\" featured some of the X-S Tech mythology, with Chairman Clench offering XS-Tech produced walker vehicles to help rescue a group of colonists, although its game play bore no resemblance to the Tomorrowland attraction.\n\nA stage show introduced in Tomorrowland (WDW) called Stitch's Supersonic Celebration (which ran from early May 2009 to late June 2009) referenced X-S Tech and the robot S.I.R, further weaving it into the general Tomorrowland world-building.\n\n"}

{"id": "2270421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270421", "title": "Hubertusburg", "text": "Hubertusburg\n\nHubertusburg is a Rococo palace in Saxony, Germany. It was built from 1721 onwards at the behest of Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, and after his death served as a residence of his son Augustus III. The 'Saxon Versailles' is chiefly known for the signing of the 1763 Treaty of Hubertusburg that ended the Seven Years' War. The palace is located in the municipality of Wermsdorf near Oschatz. \n\nThe extended Wermsdorf Forest had already been a hunting ground for the Wettin elector Augustus in the 16th century. A first Renaissance hunting lodge (\"Jagdschloss\") in Wermsdorf was erected in 1609–10. From 1699 Augustus the Strong and his governor Prince Anton Egon of Fürstenberg held festive parforce hunts here, while their large entourage and the royal guests had to be accommodated in the village and at nearby Mutzschen Castle.\n\nDuring the feast of Saint Hubertus on 3 November 1721, Augustus the Strong commissioned a new palace that should serve as a hunting lodge but also reflect the royal claims of the Saxon elector, who since 1697 ruled as King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in personal union. The palace, then one of the largest Baroque castles in Europe, was erected according to plans drawn up by the court architect Johann Christoph von Naumann. It was completed after only three years of construction in 1724. Naumann had designed a plain triple-wing complex with a \"cour d'honneur\" centered around an \"avant-corps\" and crowned by a mansard roof. Integrated in the building was a castle chapel – as expression of Augustus' conversion to the Catholic faith, to be eligible for the Polish throne. New roads were laid out from the palace to Meissen and the Dresden residence, as well as to the city of Leipzig in the northwest.\n\nAfter the death of Augustus the Strong in 1733, his son and successor Augustus III had Hubertusburg rebuilt in a Rococo style and again greatly expanded until it got its present appearance in 1752. The three-story structure now formed a rectangle, with the main façade including an oval two-story \"avant-corps\" and bearing the coat of arms of Augustus III as imperial vicar. The roof received a distinct canopy crowned by an onion dome and a weather vane with a jumping stag. Attached to the main palace extended functional buildings and stables were erected, grouped around a vast courtyard. The Saxon prime minister Heinrich von Brühl had his own \"palais\" in the right wing, embodying his special position at the court. From 1755 Brühl, though no great huntsman, served as commander of the Hubertusburg court hunts having his own cuisine and employees at his disposal. Hubertusburg was often the scene of extravagant parties and festivities. The last Hubertus feast was celebrated in 1755, before the outbreak of the Seven Years' War.\n\nWith the advance of the Prussian Army in 1756, Augustus III and Brühl fled to Warsaw, leaving Queen consort Maria Josepha and her children behind. After his defeat at the 1760 Battle of Landeshut, the forces of King Frederick the Great devastated Dresden, while Berlin and nearby Charlottenburg Palace was occupied and plundered by united Austrian, and Russian and Saxon troops. Furious Frederick ordered the plundering of Hubertusburg in revenge, however, his general Johann Friedrich Adolf von der Marwitz (according to other sources Friedrich Christoph von Saldern) refused to act. He was consequently dismissed and replaced by Frederick's confidant Karl Gottlieb Guichard, who executed the command. The decorations and inventory – except for the court chapel – were exploited by the Berlin court Jews Veitel-Heine Ephraim and Daniel Itzig.\n\nThe palace is famous for the Peace Treaty of Hubertusburg signed here after lengthy negotiations in the next year, on 15 February 1763. After the plundering, furnishings had to be removed from several inns in the vicinity to accommodate the representatives of the belligerent powers. Ratified by Frederick the Great and Empress Maria Theresa, the Treaty of Hubertusburg, with the Treaty of Paris, ended both the Seven Years' War and the French and Indian War. Augustus III died shortly afterwards on October 5; his son and heir Frederick Christian only outlived him by a few weeks. When Elector Frederick Augustus III of Saxony ascended the throne, he had Hubertusburg Place secured and rebuilt in a simplified manner.\n\nNevertheless, the days of Hubertusburg as the site of ecstatic court festivities were over. In 1770 Frederick Augustus III had a faience manufacture established in the premises, which obtained much attention at the Leipzig Trade Fair and later produced stoneware with considerable success. However, business went down during the Napoleonic Continental Blockade, while Hubertusburg served as a military hospital for the Saxon troopers of the Grande Armée, returning from the French invasion of Russia, and for the wounded of the Battle of Leipzig. From 1815 onwards, Frederick Augustus again held some royal hunts here.\n\nIn 1840, Hubertusburg was turned into a penitentiary for up to 170, mainly female, inmates. From 1872 to 1874, the Social Democratic leaders August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht were kept prisoner here, shortly before the institution was dissolved. Other parts of the palace complex served as a state hospital from 1838, from 1850 also as a lunatic asylum for women and children, a school for the blind, as well as a training school for nursing sisters. A hospital run by the Klinikum St. Georg, Leipzig still exists on the south side of the Hubertusburg grounds. During World War II, the \"Luftwaffe\" established a military academy here, which was occupied by advancing US Army forces on 25 April 1945. Handed over to the Soviet Red Army on May 5, the premises were again plundered and several remaining hospital patients deported to NKVD Special Camp Mühlberg.\n\nSince the German reunification, the premises have been gradually renovated by the Free State of Saxony. Parts are used by the workshops of the Saxon state archive, where salvaged records of the collapsed Cologne Historical Archive are repaired. The palace grounds are open to the public as a tourist destination; the interior can be visited by taking part in guided tours.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2270422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270422", "title": "Defense Language Proficiency Tests", "text": "Defense Language Proficiency Tests\n\nThe Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT) is a battery of foreign language tests produced by the Defense Language Institute and used by the United States Department of Defense (DoD). They are intended to assess the general language proficiency of native English speakers in a specific foreign language, in the skills of reading and listening. An Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI) is sometimes administered to Defense Language Institute students to establish the graduate's proficiency in speaking following training there, but it is not part of the DLPT.\n\nThe tests are meant to measure how well a person can function in real-life situations in a foreign language according to well-defined linguistic tasks and assessment criteria. Originally paper tests, they are increasingly delivered by computer.\n\nThe tests are used to assess the skill level of DoD linguists. Linguists are tested once a year in the skills of reading and listening. Test scores determine the amount of Foreign Language Proficiency Pay (FLPP) that a military linguist receives, and also whether they are qualified for certain positions that require language aptitude. DLPT scores may also figure into the readiness rating of a military linguist unit.\n\nScoring for the current (2007) series of tests, called DLPT5, is, like that for their predecessors, based on the guidelines of the Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR), with the test results stated as levels 0+ through 3 or up to 4 for some languages.\n\nMilitary language analysts are required to maintain a L2/R2 proficiency. Exams are administered annually, normally immediately after language upkeep classes, and can be taken as often as every 6 months without a language refresher course. In order to receive extra pay, they must exceed the minimum score for that language in one or more categories without falling below the minimum in either. For example:\n\nEach service maintains independent FLPP rates, which vary based on the difficulty of the language, the number of speakers of that language in the service, and the needs of the service. FLPP is awarded in addition to base pay, other pay, and is subject to taxation, except within a war zone.\n\nDLI students, regardless of their course grades, may not graduate without achieving an L2/R2 on the DLPT. They must also pass a series of tests called \"FLO (Final Learning Objective) Tests\", as well as achieve a minimum of 1+ on the OPI. Although there is a minimum standard for DLI graduation, military language analysts are not required to maintain \"speaking\" proficiency unless required in the performance of duties.\n\nBecause of the subjective wording of the distractors (i.e., the \"wrong\" answers), the fact that many individuals take versions of the test numerous times and acquire a feel for its peculiarities while others lack that advantage, and the fact that it was not nearly challenging enough, the status of the DLPT IV as a proficiency test was controversial. These are among the reasons why the DLPT5 was instated, with an emphasis on incorporating \"authentic materials\". The intention of the DLPT5 was to provide a more accurate idea of how proficient the test taker was; whether it accurately assesses proficiency is as much (or even more so) a source of controversy as with the previous version. Because the net effect on military linguists was an average drop of about half a point of proficiency across all skills and all languages, many believe that the new version was intended to be a cost saving measure by reducing FLPP.\n\nWhile the format of previous DLPTs was consistent across languages, there are two distinct formats of the DLPT5—multiple choice (in Russian, Chinese, MSA, and others) and constructed response (in some of the so-called \"Less Commonly Taught Languages\" like Hindi and Albanian).\n\nDLPT5 was initially slated to be a computer-based test, but during that version's infancy, it was proctored much like the previous exams, using scantron sheets, taped media, and test booklets. DLPT5 was taken in conjunction with DLPT IV during the trial stage of that version, and has since usurped it as the standard test. Although some versions, such as those given to linguists in the field, abroad, or in other extraordinary situations, are still paper tests, the CONUS facilities which house linguists use the computer proctored exams.\n\nDLPT is used to measure both government and military proficiency in the United States, whereas the ACTFL proficiency test is used in academic circles. Below is an equivalency chart:\n\n"}

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 19, 2002. In the episode, after accidentally injuring an endangered screamapillar, Homer is sentenced to two weeks of community service. As part of his sentence, Homer delivers Meals on Wheels to an old woman called Mrs. Bellamy, who subtly guilts trips him, and later Marge, into becoming her personal servants. One day, the two find Mrs. Bellamy dead in her house, having been stabbed by a man with braces who quickly escapes the murder scene. Being the only ones present when the police arrive, Homer and Marge are soon suspected for the murder. The episode also features a \"Snuh cascade\", an homage to a group of \"Simpsons\" fans on Usenet.\n\n\"The Frying Game\" was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Michael Polcino. The screamapillar was conceived by the episode's writer, who pitched it to the other staff writers. It has since been described as a satire on the Endangered Species Act, a United States environmental law passed during the 1970s. The idea that Homer's execution was in fact part of a reality game show was conceived by former staff writer George Meyer. The episode features Frances Sternhagen as Mrs. Bellamy and Carmen Electra as herself. In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 6.5 million viewers, finishing in 46th place in the ratings the week it aired. \n\nFollowing its home video release, the episode received mixed reviews from critics.\n\nHomer decides to give Marge a koi pond for their anniversary, but an endangered \"Screamapillar\" takes refuge in the pond. Bound by law not to disturb it, Homer accidentally injures the loud, unsettling insect larva while reading a bedtime story. While trying to bury the larva to cover up the injury, Homer is arrested and sentenced to two weeks of community service.\n\nHomer begins delivering Meals on Wheels to an elderly woman, Mrs. Bellamy, who takes a liking to him. She subtly guilt trips Homer, and later Marge, into becoming her personal servants. When Mrs. Bellamy turns up dead, having been stabbed with a pair of scissors, Homer and Marge are the prime suspects in the murder, even though they witnessed a man with braces leaving the murder scene with Mrs. Bellamy's necklace. The people of Springfield are very suspicious of Homer and Marge, and Chief Wiggum does not believe their story. Finally, during an inspection of the house, Maggie is found with Mrs. Bellamy's stolen necklace, and Wiggum arrests Homer and Marge. Bart, Lisa and Maggie are adopted by Cletus Spuckler, who decides to change their names to \"Dingus”, “Squatford Jr.” and “Pamela E. Lee\".\n\nDespite no lie detector or DNA test being given, both are sentenced to death in the electric chair. In a bid to spare Marge, Homer says that he acted alone, and Marge is released. As Homer is sitting in the electric chair, it is suddenly revealed to him that he is on a new reality TV show, \"Frame Up\" that airs on Fox TV. The whole thing was just part of an elaborate hidden camera scheme, the man with the braces is the show's host, and Mrs. Bellamy is guest host Carmen Electra in disguise. Chief Wiggum is annoyed that the police department's time was wasted on what turned out to not even be a real case, but is excited to learn he will be in the show and has them give Eddie and Lou producer credits. Homer and Marge are reunited with the kids, but Homer is infuriated that he had to suffer just so the show could get higher ratings. Electra tries to explain, but Homer ends up staring at her chest.\n\n\"The Frying Game\" was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Michael Polcino. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 19, 2002. The screamapillar, the larva that the Simpsons find in their garden, was, according to current showrunner Al Jean, Swartzwelder's \"total conception.\" He pitched the idea to the \"Simpsons\" writing staff, and because they found it \"hilarious,\" they decided to include it in the episode. Jean said that when people ask what sense of humor Swartzwelder has, the screamapillar is \"one of the best examples.\" It was voiced by main cast member Dan Castellaneta, who portrays Homer among other characters in the series. Because the screamapillar only communicates by screaming, its lines were recorded last during recording sessions, as the screaming would \"burn out\" Castellaneta's voice.\n\nIn a scene in the episode, Homer is on death row and eats his last meal. The meal consists solely of junk food like hamburgers and fried chicken. The scene came from an article that the writers had read, in which it said that death sentenced prisoners often requested junk food as their last meal. On the way to the electric chair, Homer meets a man resembling Michael Clarke Duncan's character John Coffey in \"The Green Mile\". While recording lines for the episode, the staff were told that Duncan was visiting the Fox studios. Having not recorded the lines for the character yet, the staff asked Duncan if he wanted to voice the character, but he declined. The music that plays during the scene is also from \"The Green Mile\". The idea that Homer's execution was in fact a reality show on Fox was conceived by former staff writer George Meyer. According to fellow writer Matt Selman, the writing staff liked the idea since reality shows were \"really big\" at the time. The episode features American actress Frances Sternhagen as Mrs Bellamy, and glamour model Carmen Electra as herself. According to Jean, Electra's character is \"one of the most voluptuous figures\" they have ever had on \"The Simpsons\".\n\nIn the DVD commentaries, creator Matt Groening and the majority of people who work on the show state several times that they are very liberal, but some, such as John Swartzwelder (the writer of this and many other \"The Simpsons\" episodes), are conservative. In his book \"The Really Inconvenient Truths: Seven Environmental Catastrophes Liberals Don't Want You to Know About- Because They Helped Cause Them\", Iain Murray described \"The Frying Game\" as \"subversively conservative\", and wrote that it shows \"The best popular explanation of the liberal environmentalist model for endangered species.\" In the episode, Homer buys a koi pond for Marge, only to find a screamapillar has taken residence in their garden. When Homer tries to squash it, an EPA official tells him that allowing an endangered species to die is a federal offense, under the \"Reversal of Freedoms Act of 1994.\" Homer is forced to coddle the screamapillar, and when he accidentally squashes it, Homer is found guilty of \"attempted insecticide and aggravated buggery.\" The \"Reversal of Freedoms Act\" is a reference to the Endangered Species Act, an environmental law that Murray opined had \"indeed become the Reversal of Freedoms Act.\" He continued, \"Landowners who happened to have threatened or endangered species on their lands or who simply have habitat that might be used by endangered species are routinely prevented from using their lands or property. They are stopped from undertaking such activities as harvesting their trees, grazing their cattle, irrigating their fields, clearing brush along fence lines, disking firebreaks around their homes and barns, or building new homes.\n\nIn its original American broadcast on May 19, 2002, \"The Frying Game\" received a 6.2 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 6.5 million viewers. The episode finished in 46th place in the ratings for the week of May 13–19, 2002. On August 24, 2010, \"The Frying Game\" was released as part of \"The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season\" DVD and Blu-ray set. Matt Groening, Al Jean, Matt Selman, John Frink, Don Payne, Tom Gammill, Max Pross, Michael Polcino and Deb Lacusta participated in the audio commentary of the episode.\n\nFollowing its home video release, \"The Frying Game\" received mixed reviews from critics. \n\nGiving the episode a positive review, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide described the episode as \"pretty good\", writing \"I like the obnoxious Screamapillar, and the way the Simpsons become seen as murderers also amuses. This allows S13 to move toward a satisfying conclusion.\" \n\nNate Boss of Project-Blu praised the episode's ending in particular, writing \"the ending to this episode is fucking , as it is a wonderful statement about society today, that has almost become prophetic. Can't and won't spoil it, but damn, great idea! (Yes, since there have been about eight more seasons, it's obvious they don't die. That's hardly a spoiler!)\" \n\nDVD Verdict's Jennifer Malkowski gave the episode a B+, declaring the episode's \"highlight\" \"one of the reasons the Screamapillar is endangered, that it's 'sexually attracted to fire.'\"\n\nOn the other hand, giving the episode a negative review, Andre Dellamorte of Collider described it as \"terrible.\" \n\nDVD Talk's Ryan Keefer wrote a negative review as well, calling it \"definitely forgettable\" and criticizing it for \"fall[ing] apart quickly.\" Ron Martin of 411Mania criticized the Screamapillar character, describing it as \"just as annoying as Homer's constant screaming earlier in the season.\"\n\nThe episode title is a reference to the movie \"The Crying Game\".\n\nThe story itself was based on “The Green Mile.” It even features John Coffey, Mr. Jingles, and the saying “Dead man walking on a green mile.”\n\n"}

It is the 12th episode of the . It premiered on January 5th, 1994.\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine, a space station located near a stable wormhole between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy, in orbit of the planet Bajor. In this episode, Odo's former teacher believes he has found a life form similar to Odo in the Gamma Quadrant. The episode introduces James Sloyan as Dr. Mora Pol, the Bajoran scientist that studied the Odo life-form after he was discovered.\n\nDr. Mora Pol, the Bajoran scientist who studied Odo when he was first discovered, arrives on Deep Space Nine and tells Odo that he has picked up DNA signatures similar to Odo's on a planet in the Gamma Quadrant. Mora, Odo, Dax, and Mora's assistant depart for the planet in a runabout to investigate, and while en route, Mora's fatherly attitude toward Odo, including embarrassing stories from their early time together, irritate him. Commander Sisko refers to his own father here in the past tense yet Sisko senior later plays a role in the series. \n\nUpon reaching the planet, the four of them beam to the surface, where they discover a tiny life form that may be a distant relative of Odo. Before they can return to the runabout, however, an earthquake releases volcanic gases into the air. The other three pass out, but Odo, unaffected because he does not have a respiratory system, beams them back to the runabout.\n\nBack on the station, Dax and the others are brought to the infirmary to recover, while the life form is brought to the science lab, where O'Brien tries unsuccessfully to identify it. As it appears to be growing, he puts it into a containment field, but later that night, the crew finds the lab damaged, and the life form gone, apparently having escaped through an air duct. They note that the incident was accompanied by a power drain and a rise in temperature. O'Brien, attempting to track the creature down, hears a strange noise, and then finds a puddle of goo, which they assume is the life form's remains.\n\nBashir is studying the remains in the infirmary when he is attacked by a strange creature, which he fends off with a laser scalpel. Dax's analysis of a sample reveals the DNA of the life form and the creature are different, and begins a computer search for a match with known life forms. Mora, meanwhile, recognizes the DNA pattern as Odo's and confronts him privately. He points out that the attacks occurred approximately sixteen hours apart, exactly the times when Odo reverts to his natural gelatinous state to regenerate. They surmise that the gas on the Gamma Quadrant planet might have affected Odo somehow. Panicking, Odo begins to head for the infirmary, but Mora claims Bashir will not understand and will treat Odo like a monster. He presses Odo to come back to Bajor with him, and, as he does so, the increasingly agitated Odo again transforms into the creature.\n\nSecurity picks up a power drain in Odo's office, but, when they arrive to investigate, they find nothing amiss. Having seen Odo's violent reaction to him, Mora explains to Commander Sisko and Major Kira that he is the cause of Odo's metamorphosis. The first time, he explains, the creature was trying to rescue the organism Mora had contained in the science lab; the second time, it appeared in the infirmary, where Mora was a patient; and the third time, Odo and Mora were in the middle of a heated debate. He helps the crew lure Odo in his altered state to the Promenade, where he is contained in a force field and reverts to normal.\n\nLater, the effects of the gas having been removed, Odo apologizes to Mora for attacking him. Mora apologizes to Odo for ignoring his feelings, which he finally realizes he had done when Odo had felt like a prisoner in his laboratory. Mora says he would like to be a part, however small, of Odo's life, and the two begin to reconcile.\n\n\n"}

The approach expressed in these principles is commonly known as policing by consent in the United Kingdom and other countries including Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn this model of policing, police officers are regarded as citizens in uniform. They exercise their powers to police their fellow citizens with the implicit consent of those fellow citizens. \"Policing by consent\" indicates that the legitimacy of policing in the eyes of the public is based upon a general consensus of support that follows from transparency about their powers, their integrity in exercising those powers and their accountability for doing so.\n\nIn early 19th-century Britain, attempts by the government to set up a police force for London met with a lot of opposition. People were suspicious of the idea of a large and possibly armed police force, and feared that it could be used to suppress protest or support unpopular rule. Since 1793 Britain had been at war with France, home of the best-known, best-organised and best-paid police force at the time, as well as a secret and political police force, and many Britons were uncomfortable with any police force's association with France. Most people did not think that it was the job of the national government to set up and control a police force, and thought it should be under local control.\n\nThe concept of professional policing was taken up by Robert Peel when he became Home Secretary in 1822. Peel's Metropolitan Police Act 1829 established a full-time, professional and centrally-organised police force for the Greater London area, known as the Metropolitan Police.\n\nNine principles were set out in the \"General Instructions\" issued to every new police officer in the Metropolitan Police from 1829. Although Peel discussed the spirit of some of these principles in his speeches and other communications, the historians Susan Lentz and Robert Chaires found no proof that he compiled a formal list. The Home Office has suggested that the instructions were probably written, not by Peel himself, but by Charles Rowan and Richard Mayne, the joint Commissioners of the Metropolitan Police when it was founded.\n\nThe nine principles were as follows:\n\n\nThe historian Charles Reith explained in his \"New Study of Police History\" (1956) that these principles constituted an approach to policing \"unique in history and throughout the world, because it derived, not from fear, but almost exclusively from public co-operation with the police, induced by them designedly by behaviour which secures and maintains for them the approval, respect and affection of the public\". \n\nThe Home Office in 2012 explained this approach as \"the power of the police coming from the common consent of the public, as opposed to the power of the state. It does not mean the consent of an individual\" and added an additional statement outside of the Peelian principles: \"No individual can choose to withdraw his or her consent from the police, or from a law.\"\n\nModern police reformers have described the Peelian Principles as being relevant in the present day, with American law-enforcement officer William Bratton calling them \"my bible.\"\n\nAs a result of the tradition of policing by consent, the United Kingdom has a different approach to policing public-order crime, such as riots, as compared to other western countries, such as France. Nonetheless, public order policing presents challenges to the approach of policing by consent.\n\nPolicing by consent remained a central consideration for police in the United Kingdom while enforcing temporary laws during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n"}

It was many years before construction began; however, as Saudi cut backs in the 1980s halted the lavish scheme. Plans to build a somewhat smaller structure were announced in 1989. In the meantime, the National Capital Commission had striven to turn Sussex Drive into a ceremonial boulevard and it balked at the Saudi design, threatening to take back the land. The project again came to a halt.\n\nIn 1997 a new design was developed, but neighbours complained vigorously about the number of armed guards that would surround it and the loss of green space. The plan was approved by Ottawa City Council, except for the guard houses and access road. The Saudis stated that without them the embassy could not function and shelved the $25 million project. The city and embassy negotiated and the Saudis made compromises on the size of the guardhouses and in other areas and city council, to the displeasure of local residents, approved the plan in May 1998.\n\nThe exterior of the building was completed in 2001; however it remained empty for some time, reportedly due to the strained Canadian-Saudi relations over the case of William Sampson.

{"id": "2270459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270459", "title": "Photostimulation", "text": "Photostimulation\n\nPhotostimulation is the use of light to artificially activate biological compounds, cells, tissues, or even whole organisms. Photostimulation can be used to noninvasively probe various relationships between different biological processes, using only light. In the long run, photostimulation has the potential for use in different types of therapy, such as migraine headache. Additionally, photostimulation may be used for the mapping of neuronal connections between different areas of the brain by “uncaging” signaling biomolecules with light. Therapy with photostimulation has been called light therapy, phototherapy, or photobiomodulation.\n\nPhotostimulation methods fall into two general categories: one set of methods uses light to uncage a compound that then becomes biochemically active, binding to a downstream effector. For example, uncaging glutamate is useful for finding excitatory connections between neurons, since the uncaged glutamate mimics the natural synaptic activity of one neuron impinging upon another. The other major photostimulation method is the use of light to activate a light-sensitive protein such as rhodopsin, which can then excite the cell expressing the opsin.\n\nScientists have long postulated the need to control one type of cell while leaving those surrounding it untouched and unstimulated. Well-known scientific advancements such as the use of electrical stimuli and electrodes have succeeded in neural activation but fail to achieve the aforementioned goal because of their imprecision and inability to distinguish between different cell types. The use of optogenetics (artificial cell activation via the use of light stimuli) is unique in its ability to deliver light pulses in a precise and timely fashion. Optogenetics is somewhat bidirectional in its ability to control neurons. Channels can be either depolarized or hyperpolarized depending on the wavelength of light that targets them. For instance, the technique can be applied to channelrhodopsin cation channels to initiate neuronal depolarization and eventually activation upon illumination. Conversely, activity inhibition of a neuron can be triggered via the use of optogenetics as in the case of the chloride pump halorhodopsin which functions to hyperpolarize neurons.\n\nBefore optogenetics can be performed, however, the subject at hand must express the targeted channels. Natural and abundant in microbials, rhodopsins—including bacteriorhodopsin, halorhodopsin and channelrhodopsin—each have a different characteristic action spectrum which describes the set of colors and wavelengths that they respond to and are driven to function by.\n\nIt has been shown that channelrhodopsin-2, a monolithic protein containing a light sensor and a cation channel, provides electrical stimulation of appropriate speed and magnitude to activate neuronal spike firing. Recently, photoinhibition, the inhibition of neural activity with light, has become feasible with the application of molecules such as the light-activated chloride pump halorhodopsin to neural control. Together, blue-light activated channelrhodopsin-2 and the yellow light-activated chloride pump halorhodopsin enable multiple-color, optical activation and silencing of neural activity. (See also Photobiomodulation)\n\nA caged protein is a protein that is activated in the presence of a stimulating light source. In most cases, photo-uncaging is the technique revealing the active region of a compound by the process of photolysis of the shielding molecule (‘cage’). However, uncaging the protein requires an appropriate wavelength, intensity, and timing of the light. Achieving this is possible due to the fact that the optical fiber may be modified to deliver specific amounts of light. In addition, short bursts of stimulation allow results similar to the physiological norm. The steps of photostimulation are time independent in that protein delivery and light activation can be done at different times. This is because the two steps are dependent on each other for activation of the protein.\n\nSome proteins are innately photosensitive and function in the presence of light. Proteins known as opsins form the crux of the photosensitive proteins. These proteins are often found in the eye. In addition, many of these proteins function as ion channels and receptors. One example is when a certain wavelength of light is put onto certain channels, the blockage in the pore is relieved and allows ion transduction.\n\nTo uncage molecules, a photolysis system is required to cleave the covalent bond. An example system can consist of a light source (generally a laser or a lamp), a controller for the amount of light that enters, a guide for the light, and a delivery system. Often, the design function in such a way that a medium is met between the diffusing light that may cause additional, unwanted photolysis and light attenuation; both being significant problems with a photolysis system.\n\nThe idea of photostimulation as a method of controlling biomolecule function was developed in the 1970s. Two researchers, Walther Stoeckenius and Dieter Oesterhelt discovered an ion pump known as bacteriorhodopsin which functions in the presence of light in 1971. In 1978, J.F. Hoffman invented the term “caging”. Unfortunately, this term caused some confusion among scientists due to the fact that the term is often used to describe a molecule which is trapped within another molecule. It could also be confused with the “caged effect” in the recombination of radicals. Therefore, some authors decided to use the term “light-activated” instead of “caging”. Both terms are currently in use. The first “caged molecule” synthesized by Hoffman et al. at Yale was the caged precursor to ATP derivative 1.\n\nPhotostimulation is notable for its temporal precision, which may be used to obtain an accurate starting time of activation of caged effectors. In conjunction with caged inhibitors, the role of biomolecules at specific timepoints in an organism’s lifecycle may be studied. A caged inhibitor of N-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion protein (NSF), a key mediator of synaptic transmission, has been used to study the time dependency of NSF. Several other studies have effected action potential firing through use of caged neurotransmitters such as glutamate. Caged neurotransmitters, including photolable precursors of glutamate, dopamine, serotonin, and GABA, are commercially available.\n\nSignaling during mitosis has been studied using reporter molecules with a caged fluorophore, which is not phosphorylated if photolysis has not occurred. The advantage of this technique is that it provides a “snapshot” of kinase activity at specific timepoints rather than recording all activity since the reporter’s introduction.\n\nCalcium ions play an important signaling role, and controlling their release with caged channels has been extensively studied.\n\nUnfortunately, not all organisms produce or hold sufficient amounts of opsins. Thus, the opsin gene must be introduced to target neurons if they are not already present in the organism of study. The addition and expression of this gene is sufficient for the use of optogenetics. Possible means of achieving this include the construction of transgenic lines containing the gene or acute gene transfer to a specific area or region within an individual. These methods are known as germline transgenesis and somatic gene delivery, respectively.\n\nOptogenetics has shown significant promise in the treatment of a series of neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy. Optogenetics has the potential to facilitate the manipulation and targeting of specific cell types or neural circuits, characteristics that are lacking in current brain stimulation techniques like DBS. At this point, the use of optogenetics in treating neural diseases has only been practically implemented in the field of neurobiology to reveal more about the mechanisms of specific disorders. Before the technique can be implemented to directly treat these disorders developments in other related fields such as gene therapy, opsin engineering, and optoelectronics must also make certain developments.\n\n"}

He made his debut in 2002, reaching the top division just two years later. In 2005, he reached the rank of \"ōzeki\" or 'champion', the second-highest level in the sumo ranking system behind only \"yokozuna.\" On May 24, 2008, Kotoōshū made history by becoming the first European sumo wrestler to win an Emperor's Cup. He was one of the longest serving \"ōzeki\" in sumo history, holding the rank for 47 consecutive tournaments until November 2013. In January 2014 Kotoōshū obtained Japanese citizenship, a requirement of becoming an elder in the Japan Sumo Association, and he announced his retirement during the following tournament in March. In April 2017 he opened his own training stable, Naruto.\n\nHe was originally a Greco-Roman wrestler, coached by his father, and by the age of 14 he had already won a European championship. He was accepted by the Bulgarian National Sports Academy where he majored in wrestling. He hoped to compete for Bulgaria in the 2000 Olympic Games, but as his weight increased beyond the 120 kg upper limit, he switched instead to sumo. He was recruited by Sadogatake stable, whose stablemaster was impressed by his filial duty of sending money home to his parents.\n\nMahlyanov's professional sumo debut was in November 2002, starting in the lowest-ranked \"jonokuchi\" division. He was given the \"shikona\" of Kotoōshū, derived from his place of origin — \"koto\", shared by all wrestlers at his stable, and \"ōshū\", meaning Europe. (Following the September 2006 tournament, he changed one of the characters in his ring name, 州 becoming 洲, although the pronunciation, \"shū\", is the same for both.) He posted \"kachikoshi\" (winning records in tournaments) throughout his early career, going 71–15 in the five divisions below the \"makuuchi\" top division. He reached \"makuuchi\" in September 2004, only 11 tournaments after his professional debut, the fastest rise since the introduction of the six tournaments per year system in 1958.\n\nUpon reaching the top division he had \"kachikoshi\" winning records for four consecutive tournaments, being promoted to \"san'yaku\" at the rank of \"komusubi\" before the March 2005 \"basho\" (sumo tournament). At the rank of \"komusubi\", he made his first \"makekoshi\" (losing tournament) record, and was demoted to \"maegashira\" again before returning to the higher rank of \"komusubi\" after a strong 10–5 record in May.\n\nIn the July 2005 tournament Kotoōshū defeated Asashōryū for the first time with an overarm (\"uwatenage\") throw, bringing to an end a run of 24 consecutive bout victories for the \"yokozuna\". He also was the runner up in the tournament, winning an \"outstanding performance\" \"sanshō\" prize.\n\nKotoōshū was promoted to \"sekiwake\" for the following September tournament and won his first twelve bouts, finishing with an exceptional 13–2 runner up record and only losing the tournament victory after a play-off bout with Asashōryū. An 11–4 record in the final (November) tournament of 2005 was his third runner-up performance in a row and included another victory over the otherwise dominant Asashōryū. This led to his promotion to the rank of \"ōzeki\" on November 30, 2005. His three-tournament record (on which \"ōzeki\" promotions are based) was 36–9. His promotion coincided with the retirement of his stablemaster, former \"yokozuna\" Kotozakura.\n\nHis promotion to \"ōzeki\" took only 19 tournaments from his professional sumo debut. Although he was not the youngest \"ōzeki\" ever, this represents the most rapid rise for a wrestler entering sumo from the bottom \"jonokuchi\" division. (Certain experienced amateur wrestlers can be given dispensation to start in the third-highest \"makushita\" division.) He is also the first wrestler of European birth to hold the \"ōzeki\" rank, and the fifth non-Japanese to have achieved it (following Konishiki, Akebono, and Musashimaru from Hawaii and Asashōryū from Mongolia).\n\nAfter his promotion, Kotoōshū was somewhat restricted by a knee injury. He was also criticised for relying too much on the henka technique– jumping to the side at the initial charge. It is not considered to be a move worthy of someone at his high rank.\n\nKotoōshū managed only three double-figure scores in 2006, and none at all in 2007, only doing enough to maintain his rank. Shortly before the November 2007 tournament he dislocated his right knee in training. Clearly troubled by the injury he pulled out on the 7th day, the first time in his career that he has had to withdraw from a tournament. He preserved his \"ōzeki\" rank with a 9–6 score in January 2008. In the Osaka tournament of March 2008 he injured his left arm in a match with Kakuryū on the 4th day and withdrew on Day 9 with only two wins. There was speculation that he would be demoted to \"sekiwake\" in the following tournament in May.\nNeeding eight wins to hold his rank in the May 2008 tournament, he won 12 consecutive bouts including dominating victories against \"yokozuna\" Asashōryū on the 11th day and \"yokozuna\" Hakuhō on the 12th day. He was easily defeated by Aminishiki on the 13th day, but came back strong to defeat Ama on the 14th day, becoming the first European to win a top division championship. His father was in the crowd to witness his victory. He was also congratulated by the Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov.\n\nKotoōshū was unable to follow up his victory with a push for \"yokozuna\" promotion, producing scores of only 9–6 and 8–7 in the next two tournaments. In October 2008 he denied allegations by disgraced former wrestler Wakanohō that he had thrown matches against Kotoōshū in return for money, saying \"I am saddened by this. It is all lies.\" Wakanohō subsequently retracted his comments. He produced scores of 10–5 in the first two tournaments of 2009, the best record amongst his fellow \"ōzeki\". In the May 2009 tournament, he finished the tournament with a 9–6 score. However, he ended \"yokozuna\" Hakuhō's 33-bout winning streak on the 14th day. In July 2009 he was in contention for the \"yūshō\" until the final day and finished runner-up with an impressive 13–2 score. He never won more than ten bouts in a tournament after that. He pulled out of the May 2011 tournament on Day 11, citing a knee injury. He returned in July and preserved his rank by securing his eighth win on Day 10 (the last bout of fellow \"ōzeki\" Kaiō's career), finishing on 9–6. However he withdrew once again in September after suffering five defeats in the first six days.\nIn the May 2012 tournament Kotoōshū withdrew with an ankle ligament injury on the last day, handing opponent Tochiōzan his twelfth victory by default and eliminating Hakuhō and two \"maegashira\" from the \"yūshō\" race. The crowd showed their displeasure by booing as his withdrawal was announced. He continued to suffer from injury problems, also withdrawing from the September 2012 as well as the March, September and November 2013 tournaments.\n\nHaving failed to record winning records in two consecutive tournaments, he was relegated back to \"sekiwake\" at the January 2014 tournament. He had been an \"ōzeki\" for 47 tournaments, which is the fourth highest in sumo history. A record of at least 10–5 at \"sekiwake\" in January would have allowed him to immediately regain his \"ōzeki\" rank. However, he suffered his 6th loss on the 13th day against Endō. He retired during the following tournament in March after 9 losses in a row, saying \"I’ve had so many injuries recently, but I have no regrets because I gave it my utmost over 12 years.\" In 2014 he obtained Japanese nationality and legally changed his name to Karoyan Andō (安藤 カロヤン, Andō Karoyan), he has stayed in sumo as an elder of the Sumo Association. He acquired the Naruto \"toshiyori kabu\" or elder license in 2015, and began as a coach at Sadogatake stable. \n\nAndō Karoyan (Kotoōshū) opened his own stable of wrestlers, Naruto stable (鳴戸部屋 Naruto-beya) in April 2017. He is the first European-born sumo wrestler to run his own stable and the third wrestler born outside Japan. His title is sumo elder Naruto Katsunori. The stable started with three wrestlers, including a 20-year-old Bulgarian junior wrestling champion. Having studied training theory at Nippon Sport Science University following his retirement, he was keen to develop his own training methods based on his sumo experience and studies at both Bulgarian and Japanese universities.\n\nKotoōshū was a tall and rather light \"rikishi\" at 203 cm (6 feet, 8 inches) and 152 kg (334 pounds). In comparison, former \"yokozuna\" (grand champion) Akebono, at the same height, weighed 235 kg (517 pounds) at his peak. \"Yokozuna\" Asashōryū had about the same weight, but is only 184 cm in height. Kotoōshū primarily relied on so-called 'belt-throws' to win his sumo bouts. He typically preferred to take a \"hidari-yotsu\" (left-hand inside grip) on his opponent's \"mawashi\" (the belt that is fixed around the wrestler's waist), although he was right-handed and his overall profile showed him preferring \"migi-yotsu\" (right-hand inside grip). He used his long arms and quick footwork to counteract his high center of gravity and relatively light weight. His most common winning \"kimarite\" was \"yorikiri\", the force out, followed by \"uwatenage\", the outer arm throw.\n\nKotoōshū has remarked that his tournament victory was partially due to a weight gain of five kilos which enabled him to be sturdier against his opponents.\n\n\n\nKotoōshū's father was born in 1955 or 1956 and his mother was born in 1960 or 1961 in Bulgaria.\n\nOne of the reasons that led to Kotoōshū's introduction to sumo wrestling was to help with the household, because his father could not work due to a traffic accident. Kotoōshū sent money to his parents in Bulgaria, but his parents said \"I want the child (Kotoōshū) to use it for himself.\" Until now, he is a filial son who gave a washing and drying machine to his mother, a wristwatch to his father, and two cars (a used Ford car and a new Toyota Land Cruiser). In later years Kotoōshū said, \"Why do Japanese people ask their parents to send them in after getting started? It's weird.\"\n\nIn May 2009 Kotoōshū announced his engagement to 29-year-old Asako Andō from Ichinomiya, Aichi, whom he had dated for the previous five years. The first time he became acquainted with her, he called her at a convenience store in Nagoya in 2004. A long-distance romance between Chiba and Aichi continued for five years until he proposed. The following February, had a ceremony at Hie Shrine (Chiyoda-ku). They married in February 2010, on St. Valentine's Day, at the New Otani Hotel in Tokyo, with around 600 guests including \"yokozuna\" Hakuhō attending. Kotoōshū acquired the surname of his wife and his official name became Karoyan Andō. They welcomed their first son, Kiril Andō, in November 2011.\n\nHe injured his right knee towards the end of the May 2010 tournament which required surgery and forced him to cancel plans to have a second wedding ceremony in Bulgaria, at the Evksinograd resort in Varna, during the European Sumo Championships.\n\n \n\n\n"}

In 1996, Koei issued a remake for the Japanese Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation featuring vastly improved graphics and new arrangements of the original songs.\n\nBased on the Great Classical Novel \"Water Margin\", the game takes place in ancient China during the reign of Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty. The Bandit Kings of Ancient China—a band of ten bandits—engage in war against China's Minister of War Gao Qiu, an evil minister with unlimited power. The objective of the game is to build, sustain, and command an army of troops to capture Gao Qiu before the Jurchen invasion in January 1127. Players hold certain attributes such as strength, dexterity, and wisdom. Players must also deal with other situations such as taxes, care for the troops, maintenance and replacement of weapons and equipment, forces of nature, and troop unrest and desertion.\n\nBattlefields take place on hexagonal grids, where players move their armies across various terrain in order to strategically engage and defeat the enemy army. Troops have the capability of fighting with either melee weapons, bows and arrows, magic, or dueling swords, as well as setting tiles on fire. When a player defeats an enemy army, they have the option of recruiting, imprisoning, exiling, or executing the captured enemy troops. The attacker has 30 days to defeat all deployed enemy troops, capture the commander, or be automatically defeated. The game ends in defeat for the player(s) when the game calendar hit January 1127.\n\nThe game map shows the empire composed of 49 prefectures. Any prefecture may be invaded from an adjacent territory - the only exception is the current location of Gao Qiu (usually the capital, Kai Feng) where the player must have built up sufficient popularity to gain the attention of the emperor who will confer an Imperial Edict permitting the player to march into the capital.\n\nReviewing the NES version of \"Bandit Kings of Ancient China\", \"Nintendo Power\" suggested some players might find the game's pace slow compared to action-oriented games, while others would enjoy the game's \"depth, involvement, and attention to detail.\" \"Compute!\" magazine praised the game as \"one of the most complete and entertaining role-playing simulations available\", and gave it an honorable mention in the War/Strategy category of the 1991 Compute Choice Awards. A reviewer in the \"Austin American-Statesman\" suggested the game's depth was overwhelming, calling the game \"the richest, most complex role-playing game ever published\" but saying he \"had trouble figuring out ... what [he] was supposed to be doing and to whom.\" \"PC Magazine\" reviewed the game positively, concluding that \"Bandit Kings of Ancient China\" \"is an addictive game, brought alive by a mixture of computer-driven personalities, the romance of a departed culture, a large battery of options, and the unpredictability of game play.\" \"Computer Gaming World\" gave the game three out of five stars in 1990, and two stars in 1993. The Amiga version received positive reviews in Amiga magazines. The game was reviewed in 1994 in \"Dragon\" #211 by Jay & Dee in the \"Eye of the Monitor\" column. Both reviewers gave the game 3½ out of 5 stars.\n\n\"Computer Gaming World\" named \"Bandit Kings of Ancient China\" antagonist Gao Qiu as the twelfth most memorable game villain.\n\n"}
{"id": "2270492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270492", "title": "Registered memory", "text": "Registered memory\n\nRegistered (also called buffered) memory modules have a register between the DRAM modules and the system's memory controller. They place less electrical load on the memory controller and allow single systems to remain stable with more memory modules than they would have otherwise. When compared with registered memory, conventional memory is usually referred to as unbuffered memory or unregistered memory. When manufactured as a dual in-line memory module (DIMM), a registered memory module is called an RDIMM, while unregistered memory is called UDIMM or simply DIMM.\n\nRegistered memory is often more expensive because of the lower number of units sold and additional circuitry required, so it is usually found only in applications where the need for scalability and robustness outweighs the need for a low price for example, registered memory is usually used in servers.\n\nAlthough most registered memory modules also feature error-correcting code memory (ECC), it is also possible for registered memory modules to not be error-correcting or vice versa. Unregistered ECC memory is supported and used in workstation or entry-level server motherboards that do not support very large amounts of memory.\n\nNormally, there is a performance penalty for using registered memory. Each read or write is buffered for one cycle between the memory bus and the DRAM, so the registered RAM can be thought of as running one clock cycle behind the equivalent unregistered DRAM. With SDRAM, this only applies to the first cycle of a burst.\n\nHowever, this performance penalty is not universal. There are many other factors involved in memory access speed. For example, the Intel Westmere 5600 series of processors access memory using interleaving, wherein memory access is distributed across three channels. If two memory DIMMs are used per channel, this \"results in a reduction of maximum memory bandwidth for 2DPC (DIMMs per channel) configurations with UDIMM by some 5% in comparison to RDIMM\". (p. 14). This occurs because \"when you go to two DIMMs per memory channel, due to the high electrical loading on the address and control lines, the memory controller uses a '2T' or '2N' timing for UDIMMs. Consequently, every command that normally takes a single clock cycle is stretched to two clock cycles to allow for settling time.\n\nUsually, the motherboard must match the memory type; as a result, registered memory will not work in a motherboard not designed for it, and vice versa. Some PC motherboards accept or require registered memory, but registered and unregistered memory modules cannot be mixed. There is much confusion between \"registered\" and \"ECC\" memory; it is widely thought that ECC memory (which may or may not be registered) will not work at all in a motherboard without ECC support, not even without providing the ECC functionality, although the compatibility issues actually arise when trying to use \"registered\" memory (which also supports ECC and is described as ECC RAM) in a PC motherboard that does not support it.\n\nRegistered Buffered Memory (R-DIMM) Buffered memory is an older term for registered memory. Buffered refers to an electronic buffer placed between the memory and the memory controller. In general registered RAM will not fit in a slot for unregistered RAM, however it will with SDRAM.\n\nFully Buffered DIMM (FB-DIMM) modules are used in some systems with large maximum memory capacities. In normal registered/buffered memory only the control lines are buffered, whereas in fully buffered memory the data lines are buffered as well with all transfers performed in a serial fashion; the additional logic present on each FB-DIMM module transforms serial input into parallel signals required to drive memory chips.\n\nLoad Reduced DIMM (LR-DIMM) modules are similar to registered/buffered memory, in a way that LRDIMM modules buffer both control and data lines while keeping the parallel nature of all signals. As a result, LRDIMM memory provides large overall maximum memory capacities, while addressing some of the performance and power consumption issues of FB-DIMM memory induced by the required conversion between serial and parallel signal forms.\n\nBoth FB-DIMM and LR-DIMM memory types are designed primarily to control the amount of electric current flowing to and from the memory chips at any given time. They are not compatible with registered/buffered memory, and motherboards that require them usually will not accept any other kind of memory.\n\n"}

It fights pollution, maintains public health and provides meteorological information.\n\nOn 1 April 2019, NEA's food related duties was absorbed by its successor Singapore Food Agency (SFA) which also absorbed the food related duties of two other statutory boards namely Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) and Health Sciences Authority (HSA). SFA is a statutory board under the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources.\n\nNEA comprises three operational divisions:\n\nThe Environmental Public Health Division conducts comprehensive ground surveillance and takes preventive measures to ensure a high standard of public health and hygiene. It is responsible for the overall cleanliness in Singapore and imposes a high standard of hygiene requirements on the food retail industry. It also implements the Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme (HUP) and the Clean Public Toilets Programme. It enforces smoking ban in places such as hawker centres, food shops, shopping centres, factories and offices; and conducts vector control against mosquitoes and rats.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Division is responsible for implementing programmes to monitor, reduce and prevent environmental pollution. It is also responsible for providing refuse disposal services through four waste-to-energy incineration plants and an off-shore sanitary landfill. To conserve energy resources and landfill space, the division implements programmes to minimise waste generation, and maximise recycling and energy conservation.\n\nThe Meteorological Service Singapore provides weather information to support public health and socio-economic activities. It also issues haze alerts and provides vital meteorological services to the aviation and maritime communities and the military. MSS is also on tsunami watch as part of a regional network set up after several coastal areas in Asia were devastated by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.\n\nNEA adopts a multi-pronged approach – which includes surveillance and enforcement, community outreach and education, and research, to tackle vector-borne diseases such as dengue fever. Most recently, it rolled out educational home visits, where NEA officers visit homes in areas where there are less than 10 dengue cases, to educate residents on how to prevent mosquitoes from breeding in their homes. During these visits, the officers will highlight all potential mosquito breeding grounds in that particular home and the corrective measures the resident needs to undertake. No enforcement action will be taken against the resident for any mosquito breeding found on such visits.\n\nThis approach has yielded good results, with Singapore successfully avoiding a serious dengue outbreak, as experienced in 2005 when 14, 209 people were infected with the fever. From 2007 – 2011, the number of dengue cases were 8,826; 7,031; 4,497; 5,363; and 5,330 respectively.\n\nNEA plays an important role in overseeing the cleansing of public areas in Singapore. NEA takes a three-pronged approach to keeping our environment clean, which includes: Public Cleansing; Public Education and Enforcement.\nNEA maintain an effective system of public cleansing to keep Singapore clean and prevent environment-related diseases. The cleansing of public roads and pavements is largely carried out by contractors engaged by the NEA.\n\nThe NEA works closely with their \"3P Partners\" (the people, public and private sectors) to promote anti-littering practices and to encourage members of the community to take ownership of their litter and keep their surroundings clean. Regular checks on food establishments, swimming pools and public toilets are carried out to ensure that a high standard of hygiene is maintained.\n\nIn April 2006, Singapore announced accession to the Kyoto Protocol. As a non-Annex I country, Singapore does not have targets set under KP, but it is eligible to participate in carbon credit exchanges arising from approved Clean Development Mechanism projects conducted in the country. The National Environment Agency is the designated authority coordinating CDMs. It is also spearheading ongoing measures to encourage energy efficiency and lower carbon emissions.\n\nIn April 2008, NEA launched the 10% Energy Challenge to get households to cut their electricity consumption by at least 10%. As part of this campaign, NEA collaborated with grassroots organizations and charities to train volunteers to conduct energy audits and identify wasteful energy consumption habits.\n\nOn 11 September 2009, NEA signed a landmark Voluntary Agreement with 16 major retailers and suppliers, to provide more energy efficient appliances and encourage more Singapore households to purchase them.\n\nUnder the Voluntary Agreement, participating retailers and suppliers will voluntarily commit to achieving targets set out by the NEA, including retiring stock of energy inefficient models and introducing more 3- and 4-tick models, so that energy efficient models form at least 50% of their model range after six months, and 60% of their model range after one year. Signatories also voluntarily commit to promote energy efficient appliances, as well as improve the availability and affordability of energy efficient appliances available in their stores.\n\nSince independence, Singapore's growing population and economy have resulted in a large increase in solid waste. In 1970, about 1,300 tonnes per day of solid waste were disposed of. This increased to 7000 tonnes per day by 2006, a 6-fold increase from 1970.\n\nTo address the solid waste problem, Singapore has put in place an integrated solid waste management system that ensures that all waste that are not recycled, are collected and disposed of safely at waste-to-energy incineration plants or at the offshore sanitary landfill (Semakau Landfill) in the case of non-incinerable waste.\n\nAs a result, overall recycling rate has increased from 40% in 2000 to 56% in 2008. Waste growth has also been curtailed. The total waste (domestic and non-domestic) disposed of in 2008 was 7,179 tonnes per day, a 6% reduction as compared to 2000. As a result, the lifespan of Semakau Landfill has increased from 25–30 years to 35–40 years.\n\n\n"}

Released in 1996, it is their first album with guitarist Steve Morse from Dixie Dregs, who replaced Ritchie Blackmore; Blackmore, meanwhile, resurrected Rainbow and released the album \"Stranger in Us All\".\n\nIt was recorded at Greg Rike Productions, Orlando, Florida, February to October 1995 and engineered by Darren Schneider and Keith Andrews. It had a more experimental approach than previous albums. The arrangement to \"The Aviator\", for example, employed an acoustic folk/country arrangement that had not been heard on the band's previous work since \"Anyone's Daughter\" from \"Fireball\". Several of the songs, such as \"\" featured smaller keyboard parts, and mainly center on the guitar parts. Another new addition to the guitar playing was the use of pinch harmonics, very notably used on \"Vavoom: Ted the Mechanic\" and \"Somebody Stole My Guitar\". \"Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming\" and \"Vavoom: Ted the Mechanic\" remained regular features in Deep Purple's live setlist in recent tours.\n\nLike the title of the band's following album, \"Abandon\", \"Purpendicular\" is a pun; in this case, based on the band's name and the word \"Perpendicular\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2270566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270566", "title": "Suhrawardiyya", "text": "Suhrawardiyya\n\nThe Suhrawardiyya () is a Sufi order founded by the Sufi Diya al-din Abu 'n-Najib as-Suhrawardi (1097 – 1168 CE). It is a strictly Sunni order, guided by the Shafi`i school of Islamic law (\"madhhab\"), and, like many such orders, traces its spiritual genealogy (\"silsila\") to Ali ibn Abi Talib through Junayd Baghdadi and al-Ghazali. It played an important role in the formation of a conservative ‘new piety’ and in the regulation of urban vocational and other groups, such as trades-guilds and youth clubs (\"see Futuwwa\"), particularly in Baghdad.\n\nThe order originated in Sohrevard in today's Iran though it spread all over the Islamic world under its founder's nephew, Abu Hafs Umar al-Suhrawardi (1145 – 1234 CE), who was sent by the Caliph in Baghdad as an ambassador to the Ayyubid Sultan Al-Adil I of Egypt, to Khwarezm-Shah Muhammad of Bukhara and to Kayqubad I, Sultan of Rûm.\n\nThe order's founder was a disciple (\"murid\") of Ahmad Ghazali, brother of the noted thinker Imam Abu Hamid al-Ghazali, who taught Shafi'i jurisprudence (\"fiqh\") at Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad Academy. His surviving work is called \"Kitab Adab Al-Muridin\" - \"The Book of Duty of Disciples\".\n\nThe founder's nephew Shahab al-Din Abu Hafs Umar Suhrawardi, author of \"Awarif ul-Maarif\", (\"The Heights of the Gnostics\"), renounced reclusiveness and austerity in favour of an active life in society, maintaining close contact with the civil authorities and undertaking diplomatic missions and the political settlement of conflicts. His luxurious cloister in Baghdad, with gardens and bath houses, was built for him by Caliph an-Nasir.\n\nSheikh Umar directed his disciple Baha-ud-din Zakariya to make Multan in present-day Pakistan the centre of his activity; and similarly his other disciple Syed Jalaluddin Surkh-Posh Bukhari made Uch his headquarters. Iltutmish appointed him \"Sheikh ul-Islam\" after the invasion of Multan and the overthrow of its ruler Nasir-ud-Din Qabacha. During the Mongol invasion he became the peace negotiator between the invaders and the Muslim army. Bukhari, known as \"Makhdum Jahaniyan Jahangasht\", the world traveller, was a puritan who strongly objected to Hindu influence on Muslim social practices.\n\nThe order became popular in India owing to the work of Bukhari and his successor Baha-ud-din Zakariya. Zakariya's successor was his son Shaikh Sadruddin ‘Arif. His disciple Amir Husayn, the author of \"Zad- al-Musafirin\", wrote several works on the doctrine of the oneness of being. Shaikh Arif’s son and successor Ruknuddin was highly respected by the Delhi Sultans from Alauddin Khalji to Muhammad Ibn Tughlaq.\n\nAfter the death of Shaikh Ruknuddin the Suhrawardiyya declined in Multan but became popular in other provinces like Uch, Gujarat, Punjab, Kashmir and Delhi. The Suhrawardiyya order became popular in Bengal with the arrival of Sufis to Maner Sharif. Noted Sufis of the order in Bihar and Bengal include Makhdoom Esrail Maneri, his brother Makhdoom Ismail Maneri and son Makhdoom Yahya Maneri (also educated at Nizamiyyah at Baghdad and a murid of Shahab al-Din Abu Hafs Umar Suhrawardi), Makhdoom Shahabuddin Pir Jagjot, Makhdoom Salah Darwesh Maneri, Makhdoom Taqiuddin Mahsawi, Makhdoom Ahmed Chiramposh and others.

The Keladi Nayakas were successors of the Vijayanagara Empire in the coastal and Malnad (hill) districts of Karnataka, India, in the late 16th century. At their peak, the Nayakas built a niche kingdom comprising the coastal, hill and some interior districts (Bayaluseeme) of modern Karnataka, before succumbing to the Kingdom of Mysore in 1763, which at that time was ruled by Hyder Ali. He was known as \"Sistina\" Shivappa Nayaka because he introduced a tax system called \"Sist\".\n\nShivappa Nayaka is remembered as an able administrator and soldier. He ascended the throne in 1645. During this time, the last ruler of the diminished Vijayanagara Empire ruling from Vellore, Shriranga Raya III was defeated by the Bijapur Sultanate and sought refuge with Shivappa. The growing threat of the Portuguese was eliminated by 1653 and the ports of Mangalore, Kundapura and Honnavar were brought under Keladi control. Having conquered the Kannada coast, he marched down to Kasargod region of modern Kerala and installed a pillar of victory at Nileshvara. The forts of Chandragiri, Bekal and Mangalore were built by Shivappa Nayaka.\n\nLater he invaded north of the Tungabhadra river and captured territory in the modern Dharwad district from the Bijapur Sultanate. In the south, when he invaded and laid siege to Srirangapatna in modern Mysore district, an epidemic broke out in his army forcing him the withdraw. In the south, he destroyed the Portuguese political power in the Kanara region by capturing all the Portuguese forts of the coastal region.\n\nShivappa Nayaka introduced a revenue settlement scheme called \"Sist\", a policy that has found favourable comparison to revenue schemes formulated by the Mogul emperor Akbar. According to this scheme, agricultural lands were divided into five types depending on the type of soil and available irrigational facilities. A unit of sowing capacity called \"Khanduga\" was developed and every irrigable land was taxed in varying amounts based on this unit. The rate of taxation depended on the yield in each one of these five types of land, the rate varying from village to village and amounting to a third of the total yield. Shivappa Nayaka gave importance to agriculture which resulted in an expanding agrarian economy. A religious and tolerant man, Shivappa Nayaka performed Vedic sacrifices and rituals and patronised the Hindu Advaita order of Sringeri. He was tolerant towards Christians and gave them land to cultivate. He encouraged the mercantile communities of South India such as the Komatis and Konkanis to settle down and establish businesses in his kingdom.\n\nAn interesting episode from the time of Shivappa Nayaka's rule goes as follows. A poor Brahmin named Ganesh Mallya came to Keladi, the capital city, with the intention of finding a job. Having no money, he carried a bag full of home-grown coconuts. Before entering the city, every traveller had to pass through eight toll gates, each of which collected a tax. Because he carried no cash, Ganesh Mallya had to part with two coconuts at each toll gate, one as tax and the other as a gift to the official. He also paid with two coconuts at the city entrance. Frustrated with all the tolls, Mallya boldly set up his own toll gate (the ninth toll gate) and collected a toll after registering full details of travellers into the city in his own register. In return for the toll, Ganesh Mallya handed out a receipt with a note \"new custom station for eighteen coconuts, signature of Ganeshayya Raja of Kumta\". This went on unnoticed for eighteen months before King Shivappa Nayaka heard of it. When summoned by the king, Ganesh Mallya admitted he had collected an illegal toll to make a livelihood. Impressed by his honesty and business acumen, Shivappa Nayaka took Ganesh Mallya into his service.\n\nShivappa Nayaka was succeeded on the throne by his younger brother Chikka Venkatappa Nayaka in 1660.\n\n"}

{"id": "2270583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270583", "title": "Wright Amendment", "text": "Wright Amendment\n\nThe Wright Amendment of 1979 was a United States federal law that governed traffic at Dallas Love Field, an airport in Dallas, Texas, to protect Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) from competition. The amendment prohibited carriers from operating full-size airliners between Love Field and destinations beyond Texas and its four neighboring states. Further amendments in 1997 and 2005 added new states and relaxed aircraft rules for long-range service. The law was partially repealed in 2006 and then fully repealed in 2014.\n\nBy the early 1960s, Love Field was reaching the limits of its terminal and parking capacity despite repeated expansion projects, and its runways were too short to handle new intercontinental jets. Greater Southwest International Airport (GSIA or GSW) had been constructed in Fort Worth in the 1950s, but efforts to share the airport had proven unsuccessful. The situation was inefficient and hampered airline service to both cities, and in 1964, the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) ordered Dallas and Fort Worth to find a site for a new joint regional airport. However, many Dallas residents remained satisfied with Love Field, and an attempt to establish an independent Dallas Fort Worth Regional Airport Authority—despite strong backing from the Dallas Chamber of Commerce and Dallas mayor J. Erik Jonsson—failed when Dallas voters rejected the proposal by a narrow margin. After further negotiation, the cities instead established an appointed airport board consisting of seven members from Dallas and four from Fort Worth, and were able to persuade all eight existing air carriersat Love and GSW to move to the new regional airport.\n\nTo protect the regional airport from competition and thereby protect bond investments, the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth signed the Regional Airport Concurrent Bond Ordinance on 12 November 1968, which reads in part:\n\nThe effort culminated in the demolition of GSW, the 1974 opening of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), the closure of Love Field to certified air carriers, and a corresponding effort to redevelop Love to be used primarily for corporate aviation.\n\nSouthwest Airlines (originally Air Southwest) was founded after the 1968 agreement between the airlines and cities to relocate to DFW; it was not a party to the agreement and felt that their business model would be affected by a long drive to the new airport. Before DFW's opening, Southwest filed suit to remain at Love Field, claiming that no legal basis existed to close the airport to commercial service and that they were not bound by an agreement they did not sign. In 1971, Southwest obtained an operating certificate from the Texas Aeronautics Commission (TAC) for intrastate flights, claiming that the CAB had no authority over flights that did not cross state borders; however, Southwest was quickly sued by Dallas, Fort Worth, and the D/FW Airport Board, who contested this assertion, claiming that the 1964 CAB ruling also applied to the new carrier. In 1973, a federal district court ruled that Southwest's proposed intrastate service fell outside of CAB jurisdiction, and so long as Love Field remained open, the City of Dallas could not preclude Southwest from operating there.\n\nWhen DFW opened in 1974, every airline except Southwest moved to the new airport. With the drastic reduction in flights, Love Field closed most of its concourses.\n\nAfter the Airline Deregulation Act was enacted in 1978, Southwest Airlines announced plans to begin interstate service in 1979 with flights to New Orleans, a proposal that was quickly endorsed by the CAB. However, Texas officials—particularly those from Fort Worth—thought that increased traffic at Love Field could draw flights away from DFW Airport and threaten its financial stability. To protect the new airport, Jim Wright, member of the U.S. House of Representatives serving Fort Worth, sponsored and helped pass an amendment to the International Air Transportation Act of 1979 in Congress that restricted passenger air traffic at Love Field in the following ways: \n\nWhile the law deterred major airlines from starting (or resuming) service out of Love Field, Southwest quickly expanded its Love Field operation by undercutting the high fares charged by legacy airlines to fly to smaller, underserved airports in the five-state region. This had the effect of increasing local traffic to non-Wright Amendment-impacted airports such as Houston/Hobby Airport, El Paso International Airport, Albuquerque International Sunport, and the New Orleans airport.\n\nThe through-ticketing and connecting flight restrictions in the law were not seriously explored until Continental Airlines proposed in 1985 to begin service between Love Field and Houston. Dallas, Fort Worth, and the D/FW Airport Board attempted to bar the airline from Love Field on the grounds that it offered interline through-ticketing, a service not offered by Southwest. However, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) decreed that an airline was merely disallowed from through-ticketing flight segments to or from Love Field. Additionally, the USDOT ruled that selling a passenger a separate ticket on a connecting flight at another airport—a practice known as double ticketing—was perfectly legal provided that the airline was not \"advertising, promoting, or otherwise affirmatively soliciting double ticketing passengers.\" An airline was thus allowed to sell a connecting ticket provided that it was requested by the traveler rather than being solicited by the ticket agent. Following this ruling, a sophisticated Southwest passenger could work the system and get around the Wright Amendment's restrictions by flying from Dallas to another airport in the five-state region, changing planes, and then flying on a separate ticket to any city Southwest served.\n\nThe Wright Amendment became controversial in Dallas; some argued that it unfairly restricted airline competition by discouraging carriers other than Southwest from serving Love Field, while others supported it to mitigate jet noise and protect property values near the airport. By late 1989, Dallas City Council member Jerry Bartos emerged as a leader of the effort to repeal Wright, gaining the backing of mayor Annette Strauss, and Kansas U.S. House Rep. Dan Glickman sponsored a bill calling for the amendment's repeal. In September of that year, the Dallas City Council approved a compromise resolution calling for the amendment's four-state limit to be changed to a perimeter limit allowing direct flights to Denver and Nashville. By 1990, Southwest was supportive of the resolution, but it had galvanized opposition by local property owners, and D/FW Airport supporters were alarmed by a declaration by American Airlines that it could cancel a proposed terminal project there and move many flights to Love. In early July, Texas members of the U.S. House Rules Committee blocked Glickman's bill, Strauss withdrew her support, and the City Council rescinded their 1989 vote.\n\nIn 1996, Dallas aviation company Dalfort Aviation announced the launch of Legend Airlines, a new air carrier that would operate long-range flights from Love Field using jets with 56 seats—the maximum number allowed for long-haul flights under Wright. The new airline would be headed by T. Allan McArtor and would use refurbished McDonnell Douglas DC-9s or Boeing 727s—aircraft that normally carried 90 or more passengers—with an all-first class configuration and the excess space used for cargo. McArtor and Dalfort CEO Bruce Leadbetter claimed that buying new regional jets with 56 or fewer seats was too expensive and would not provide Dalfort with much-needed overhaul business. However, the USDOT general counsel ruled in September 1996 that the 56-seat restriction applied to the \"designed capacity\" of an airliner rather than to the number of seats actually installed, prompting Legend to seek a change in the law; Texas Rep. Joe Barton was soon calling for the U.S. House to address of the 56-seat requirement.\n\nBy July 1997, McArtor had enlisted the help of Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, who proposed to change to Wright restrictions to allow Legend to start service using the refurbished planes; however, he was opposed by Texas senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. On 7 October 1997, despite fierce opposition from Hutchison and Rep. Kay Granger of Fort Worth, Shelby's efforts culminated in the passage of a Senate funding bill that included his amendment to allow unrestricted flights to Alabama, Kansas, and Mississippi and to allow nationwide flights using aircraft reconfigured with 56 seats. On 9 October 1997, the U.S. House overwhelmingly approved the transportation funding bill containing the Shelby Amendment, with President Bill Clinton expected to promptly sign it into law. \n\nThe passage of the Shelby Amendment prompted a flurry of lawsuits. Within a month, Fort Worth and Dallas had sued each other, with Fort Worth arguing for upholding the 1968 bond agreement and Dallas arguing that it could no longer be enforced. American Airlines joined Fort Worth in suing Dallas; Legend CEO McArtor accused American of having quietly orchestrated the entire campaign to stop the expansion of service from Love in order to block Legend. By February 1998, Mesa Airlines, which had begun intrastate service from Meacham Field in May 1997, had joined Fort Worth, and Southwest Airlines joined the Dallas lawsuit at the behest of Legend.\n\nOn 19 May 1998, Continental Airlines—a party to the original 1968 bond agreement—and its regional affiliate Continental Express sued both cities over their refusal to allow interstate service at Love Field using 50-seat Embraer ERJ-145s, which fit within the 56-seat restriction. The lawsuit argued that the cities no longer had the authority to block long-haul service that complied with federal law. This in turn prompted D/FW Airport to preemptively sue American Airlines to prevent them from likewise operating from Love, even though the airline denied having plans to do so. \n\nMcArtor argued that Fort Worth was also violating the bond agreement by allowing Mesa and FedEx Express to operate from Meacham and the recently-constructed Fort Worth Alliance Airport respectively. In October 1998, Legend sued Fort Worth, accusing the city of a \"double standard\" in its simultaneous support for Alliance and opposition to expansion at Love. However, State District Judge Bob McCoy dismissed the suit later that month on the grounds that Legend was not a party to the 1968 DFW bond agreement and thus lacked standing to sue.\n\nDallas and Fort Worth's efforts to block Continental Express were unsuccessful; the carrier began intrastate flights between Love Field and George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston on 11 June 1998, becoming only the third airline to start new service at Love after the 1968 bond agreement, following Southwest and the defunct Muse Air. On 10 February 2000, a federal judge lifted an injunction against the airline's proposed interstate service to Cleveland, and the airline announced that the service would begin on 1 June.\n\nOn 5 April 2000, after further legal battles against Fort Worth and American Airlines and delays in gaining final approval from the FAA, Legend began the first long-haul service from Love Field since 1974 with a flight to Washington Dulles International Airport in a refurbished 56-seat McDonnell Douglas DC-9. Legend soon operated scheduled passenger service nonstop from Love Field to Los Angeles (LAX), New York LaGuardia Airport (LGA), Las Vegas (LAS), and Dulles (IAD). On 1 May 2000, American Airlines launched a direct challenge to Legend with its first flights from Love Field since 1974, starting service with Fokker 100s specially refitted with 56 first-class seats and offering flights to Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\nOn 29 June 2000, the United States Supreme Court declined to review a federal appeals court decision allowing long-haul flights from Love, effectively ending the last attempt by Fort Worth, the D/FW Airport Board, and American Airlines to stop such flights. Board officials stated that they would not pursue further legal action.\n\nDespite the Shelby Amendment, Southwest did not add flights to the new states, citing a lack of demand.\n\nIn 2005, Senator Kit Bond of Missouri attached an amendment to a transportation spending bill to exempt his state from the Wright restrictions. Soon after the bill's passage, Southwest began nonstop flights from Love Field to St. Louis and Kansas City on 13 December 2005. The same day, American Airlines responded with an announcement that it would start service from Love Field to the same Missouri airports on 2 March 2006, along with flights to the Southwest strongholds of San Antonio and Austin, Texas.\n\nIn late 2004, Southwest Airlines announced its opposition to the Wright Amendment. Shortly thereafter, the company began trying to garner public support for the repeal of the Wright Amendment by launching a massive public relations campaign. Print media, the Internet, billboards, and TV spots were all used, directing the viewer or reader to visit the Set Love Free website, created by Southwest Airlines. In response, a group opposed to the repeal of the amendment, spearheaded by the DFW Airport Board and American Airlines, launched their own media campaign directing visitors to their Keep DFW Strong site (DFW Airport has even painted advertising on one of its water tanks on the north side of DFW).\n\nCritics of the amendment asserted that the restrictions on long-haul travel from Dallas Love Field were anti-competitive. They asked for the \"freedom to fly\" from Love Field to any destination. They also argued that the restrictions on full use of Love Field artificially inflated fares at the DFW Airport. They believed that eliminating the amendment, and thus allowing any airline to fly long-haul service out of DAL, would allow the so-called \"Southwest effect\" to occur, where new, inexpensive capacity will increase traffic at both airports (assuming that the market effect of low fares on flights into and out of Love Field will serve to drive down fares on corresponding routes at DFW); these projections are based upon historic results in other air travel markets in which low-fare carriers, most frequently, Southwest, have initiated service. Wright opponents also argued that DFW's main tenant, American Airlines, could charge high prices out of DFW because, with AA controlling in excess of 80% of air carrier traffic at DFW, there is little competition on most routes, a problem that has recently been attributed to Delta Air Lines discontinuing its usage of DFW as a hub.\n\nSupporters of the amendment said that DFW Airport is the economic engine of the metroplex area, and did not wish for a competing airport to either take traffic from DFW or drive the prices down there, although they did concede that American's fares are often higher than from other airports. What's more, DFW Airport recently completed construction of a $2.5-billion people mover system to transport passengers between terminal buildings. The DFW Airport Authority stated concerns that the financial burdens caused by such things as the people mover project and the recent pull down of Delta Air Lines' hub would hamper airport profitability and sustainability if a direct competitor to DFW were introduced into the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. A primary concern of many in the DFW area was that American is the largest employer in the North Texas area and many people associated with DFW and American Airlines were reluctant to put any jobs at risk, especially when considering the chronic financial difficulties that modern airlines, other than Southwest, face. Another concern of people in the immediate area of the airport was that of nuisance noise and traffic; the area near Love Field, especially the incorporated \"Park Cities\" (University Park and Highland Park) and the \"Uptown\" section of Dallas, has become high-value real estate, and developers and residents feared that increased air and street traffic into the airport, and increased fuel loads for interstate flights requiring higher takeoff throttles and lower rates of ascent, would lessen the desirability and thus land values of the area.\n\nOn June 15, 2006, it was announced that American, Southwest, DFW Airport and the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth had all agreed to seek full repeal of the Wright Amendment, with several conditions. Among them: The ban on nonstop flights outside the Wright zone would stay in place until 2014; through-ticketing to domestic and foreign airports (allowing connecting flights to long-haul destinations without requiring the previous workaround of buying separate tickets) would be allowed immediately; Love Field's maximum gate capacity would be lowered from 32 to 20 gates; and Love would handle only domestic flights non-stop.\n\nThe proposed compromise was opposed by JetBlue Airways and other low-fare carriers, who argued that the gate reductions at Love would harm their ability to begin service there, and by area congressmen who opposed provisions of the deal that they believed would restrict competition in passenger service at other airports within an radius of DFW and Love, including Collin County Regional Airport in the nearby city of McKinney. The compromise was also opposed by Love Field Terminal Partners, owners of the old Legend Airlines terminal. They claimed that the announcement of the compromise prevented them from selling the six gate terminal to Pinnacle Airlines who had shown interest in purchasing or leasing the gates and have several lawsuits to prevent the compromise's implementation.\n\nOn July 25, 2006, a leaked memorandum from an employee of the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division raised concerns about airline competition in North Texas and urged legislators to force a renegotiation of the deal. It also stated that the removal of gates and a cap of 20 gates for the airport would violate federal anti-trust legislation. This capping of gates would affect the other airlines that might be attracted to getting gates at Dallas Love Field airport.\n\nSen. Kay Bailey Hutchison responded to the memorandum by stating \"They [Justice] are not taking a position at all on the legislation... That memo did not go through the channels. And it probably was one person's view, but it's not the Justice Department's.\"\n\nJudiciary Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner also had some complaints about the anti-trust issues that he thought would arise from the proposed legislation since Southwest will be able to operate from 16 gates, American 2 gates, and Continental 2 gates without further gates available for other carriers.\n\nAfter extensive negotiations with the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, the compromise bill passed both Houses of Congress on Friday, September 29, 2006, just before the 109th Congress adjourned for the November elections. Hutchison led the effort to pass the bill in the Senate while Rep. Kay Granger led a bipartisan Texas House coalition to see the bill through to a successful conclusion in the House. President George W. Bush signed the bill into law on October 13, 2006, including the 20-gate cap. Southwest and American airlines then required approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to begin one-stop flights from Love Field to destinations outside the Wright limits.\n\nEven though non-stop flights were restricted until October 16, 2014, Southwest Airlines announced on October 17, 2006 that it would begin direct flight (same plane with one stop) and connecting service between Love Field and 25 destinations outside the Wright zone on October 19, 2006. American Airlines also made indirect connecting travel between Love Field and locations outside the Wright zone available by October 18, 2006.\n\nOn October 13, 2014, the amendment expired, allowing airlines to fly from Love Field to any city in America.\n\nThe original text of the Wright Amendment (from International Air Transportation Competition Act):\n\n"}

During his MMA career he was regarded by many as the best fighter in the world, and was a World Vale Tudo Championship tournament winner, a two-time UFC heavyweight tournament winner, and a PRIDE FC competitor.\n\nIn 2003 Kerr was the subject of an HBO documentary titled \"\", which detailed his MMA career fighting in Vale Tudo, the UFC and PRIDE. \"The Smashing Machine\" also focused on Kerr's eventual addiction to opiates, his relationships with his then-girlfriend, various training partners, and his friendship with Mark Coleman.\n\nMark Kerr was born in Toledo, Ohio to Tom and Mary Kerr. From early childhood, he would dream of being in the World Wrestling Federation and would hold mock fights with his younger siblings in the back yard.\n\nIn 1983, Kerr began his wrestling career in Bettendorf, Iowa wrestling as a freshman at Bettendorf High School where he shared the wrestling room with another future MMA champion Pat Miletich who was a senior at the time. After his freshman year at Bettendorf, Kerr and his family moved to Toledo, Ohio where he became a high school state champion wrestling for Toledo Waite.\n\nAt Syracuse University, Kerr was the Division I champion at 190 pounds in 1992. Randy Couture, wrestling for Oklahoma State University, took second place. Kerr was also a Division I All-American in 1992. In 1994, Kerr was the USA Senior Freestyle Champion at 220 pounds.\n\nWhile training as an amateur wrestler, Kerr became interested in mixed martial arts as a way to earn money. He, his long-time friend and training partner Mark Coleman and Tom Erikson were initially scouted by Richard Hamilton, who had managed Ultimate Fighting Championship fighter Don Frye until a falling out and was now offering a place in UFC 10 against him. However, nothing came from it, and Coleman ended up hunting down the chance. Eventually, Kerr and Hamilton arranged for the former to train with Coleman and fight at Brazilian event World Vale Tudo Championship 3 in January 1997. His appearance was highly anticipated, as other wrestlers like Coleman or Erikson were already known in the MMA community, though there were doubts about Kerr's true skills. Kerr himself was doubtful about it, to the point Hamilton had to force him to fight under the threat the Brazilian crowd might riot and kill him if he didn't show up.\n\nKerr made his debut in MMA at WVC 3 against UFC veteran Paul Varelans. The bout lasted two minutes, with Kerr slamming Varelans with a takedown, mounting him and landing punches and knee strikes for the stoppage. The same happened to his next opponent, Mestre Hulk, a capoeira police teacher who had become known for besting Brazilian jiu-jitsu fighter Amaury Bitteti. After losing two teeth to Kerr's ground and pound, Hulk crawled out of the ring, getting disqualified. Kerr then reached the finals, where he was pitted against jiu-jitsu fighter Fabio Gurgel. Again, the fight would bring echoes, this time those of the bout between Erikson and Gurgel's teammate Murilo Bustamante, which happened the same year.\n\nKerr went to the fight with a broken hand from the Hulk fight, but he had 50 pounds over Gurgel. He took Gurgel down, passed his guard with ease and bloodied him with multiple kinds of strikes. The situation prolonged itself by 19 minutes, with the Brazilian trying armlocks and triangle chokes from the bottom, but Kerr avoided them and kept landing punishment. The fight had no time limit, but at the 30 minute mark, seeing that Gurgel was unable to defend anymore, the judges stopped the fight and gave Kerr the win.\n\nFollowing his success in Brazil, Mark Kerr was invited to fight in the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Kerr had previously been told of the event by Coleman, who was himself a UFC tournament winner and champion by this point. Kerr's first bout in the UFC came at UFC 14 where he fought in the heavyweight tournament. His first fight was against krav maga representative Moti Horenstein, and Kerr defeated his opponent by technical knockout at 2:22 of the first round. With this win Kerr advanced to the finals of the tournament where he beat Dan Bobish with a submission (chin to the eye) at 1:38 of the first round; Kerr's win over Bobish earned him the UFC 14 Heavyweight tournament title.\n\nFollowing his success at UFC 14, Kerr was invited to compete at the next UFC tournament — UFC 15. In this tournament, Kerr's first opponent was Greg Stott whom he defeated in 17 seconds from the opening of the fight, winning by way of knockout with a knee to his opponent's head. Advancing to the finals, Kerr fought Dwayne Cason and finished his opponent within the first minute of the opening round, winning the UFC 15 Heavyweight tournament. Kerr's winning of the UFC 15 tournament was his last fight for the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Following his win of UFC 15, Kerr decided to fight in Japan for the Pride Fighting Championships due to the UFC's promotional difficulties and Pride's larger paychecks.\n\nAfter considering an offer from Japanese promotion Shooto, Kerr signed up with Pride for a matchup against fellow UFC champion Royce Gracie at Pride 2 in 1998. The match, as per Gracie's demands, would have been without time limits or referee stoppages. However, Royce pulled out after the fight had been advertised. Kerr was then slated to fight Branco Cikatic. Kerr utilized the same ground-and-pound fighting style from his previous fights, taking his opponent onto the mat and then using strikes and submissions to try to finish the fight. Kerr was said to be an improved version of Mark Coleman because he was proficient in wrestling, submissions, and take downs, with good cardio and an ever-improving striking game under his tutelage with Bas Rutten. Around the time that Kerr entered PRIDE, many considered Kerr to be one of the top MMA Heavyweight fighters in the world.\n\nKerr won four bouts between Pride 2 and Pride 6. However, his status was soon questioned after his first bout with Igor Vovchanchyn at Pride 7, in which he was knocked out by illegal knee strikes. Even though the loss was overturned and changed to a \"No Contest\" ruling, Kerr admitted that the initial loss had been a difficult decision for him to face. Following his fight against Vovchanchyn, Kerr fought in the Pride Grand Prix 2000 Opening Round and won over Enson Inoue. His win against Inoue earned him a place at the Pride Grand Prix 2000 Finals, where he fought Kazuyuki Fujita and lost by decision. At Pride 10 - Return of the Warriors Kerr defeated Igor Borisov by submission. Four months later, at Pride 12 - Cold Fury, he lost by decision in the rematch with Vovchanchyn. Kerr then lost to Heath Herring at Pride 15 via TKO. With his second loss in a row, Kerr decided to take time away from MMA.\n\nIn 2004, Kerr returned to PRIDE, fighting Yoshisha Yamamoto at Pride 27. Just forty seconds of the first round, Kerr lost to Yamamoto after inadvertently knocking himself out by driving his own head into the mat while attempting a double leg take down. With his third straight loss under the PRIDE FC banner, Kerr quit PRIDE.\n\nSpeaking of Kerr's time fighting in Japan, Mark Coleman said, \"Every time a fight came around he was pretty scared. He was intimidated by the whole situation and that is probably what led to him using pain killers.\"\n\nAfter his loss to Yoshihisa Yamamoto, Kerr was supposed to make his comeback against Wes Sims in the American Championship Fighting (ACF) on May 6, 2006 at the Denver Coliseum, but was not medically cleared to fight due to a hand injury.\n\nOn February 11, 2007, Kerr fought Mustafa Al Turk at Cage Rage 20: 'Born 2 Fight'. Kerr lost his footing after an attempted roundhouse kick and he was mounted, stunned with a series of blows and submitted within the first round. Kerr was supposed to fight Sean O'Haire on August 17 in the Global Fighting Championships first show at the Mohegan Sun Arena but was cancelled due to his high blood pressure and his license was suspended indefinitely. \n\nMark Kerr fought in the World Cage Fighting Organization (WCO) in November 2007, winning his bout against Steve Gavin by Americana after 1:39 of the first round.\n\nKerr competed in the ADCC Submission Wrestling World Championship (ADCC), a world class submission wrestling tournament. In 2000, Kerr won the ADCC Open Weight Absolute Tournament. Among the fighters he defeated at ADCC were Carlos \"Carlão\" Barreto, Sean Alvarez, Ricco Rodriguez, Mike Van Arsdale, Josh Barnett and Tony Netcler. It was quite notable at the time when Mark Kerr, Mario Sperry and Royler Gracie were dominating the ADCC each in their own weight classes.\n\nKerr is an avid powerlifter, reportedly able to bench press 425 lb (192.5 kg) and squat 550 lb (250 kg).\n\nIn 2008, Kerr launched a comeback. In March, Mark beat Chuck Huus by Submission (Keylock/Americana) at CCCF – Battle on the Border. In April, he lost to Oleg Taktarov in one round by kneebar. Two months later, Kerr was choked out in the opening round by deaf fighter Tracy Willis at a C-3 Fights show in Cocho, Oklahoma. On July 26, Ralph Kelly stopped Kerr in the first round at Xp3. On September 27, 2008 Kerr lost to fellow heavyweight Jeff Monson by rear-naked choke, in a battle of former ADCC champions.\n\nOn July 28, 2009, Kerr faced fellow wrestler Muhammed Lawal at an M-1 Global event. Kerr was taken down and subsequently pounded into unconsciousness in just 25 seconds, receiving several blows to the head after he was clearly unable to defend himself. This led the event's TV commentators to openly speculate that Kerr's fighting career was over. Guy Mezger, in the post-fight discussion, suggested that it was time for Kerr to \"find another vocation\". Kerr has only won four of his 15 fights since 2000 and has lost each of his last five fights.\n\nKerr considers himself \"99.9 percent\" retired and is pursuing a degree with an eye on pharmaceutical sales.\n\nIn 2003, HBO aired a documentary titled \"\", directed by John Hyams, which dealt with the life and career of Mark Kerr. The program chronicles Kerr's addiction to painkillers and the \"no holds barred\" aspect of early mixed martial arts competition. Kerr's then-girlfriend, Dawn Staples, and mixed-martial artists Bas Rutten, Kevin Randleman and Mark Coleman also appear in the film. Bas Rutten states clearly during the documentary that due to Kerr's ability to end fights quickly, the tournament directors were removing all of Kerr's 'weapons' (notably head-butts and knees to the head of a grounded opponent) in an attempt to make the fights last longer for television and crowd satisfaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Serbian Rugby League was reborn on 10 November 2001 after 40 years of non existence due to the Yugoslav Communist dictatorship banning the game in the mid 1960s because they favoured Rugby Union which Croatia was playing at the time. Rugby League was first played in Serbia in 1953.\n\nRugby League was first played in Serbia in 1953 when it was introduced by Dragan Marsicevic, secretary of the Yugoslav Sport Association. Two French teams toured later that year, and in 1954 the clubs Partizan and Radnički were formed. These clubs played their first match on 26 April 1954. In 1961 a Yugoslav Rugby League team played its only game against a French Select XIII team in Banja Luka. The French team won 13-0. The sport died out soon afterwards not due to the communist regime banning the sport.\n\nThe rebirth of Serbian Rugby League Federation was on 10 November 2001 with the new federation been formed.

{"id": "2270643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270643", "title": "Stan McCabe", "text": "Stan McCabe\n\nStanley Joseph \"Stan\" McCabe (16 July 1910 – 25 August 1968) was an Australian cricketer who played 39 Test matches for Australia from 1930 to 1938. A short, stocky right-hander, McCabe was described by \"Wisden\" as \"one of Australia's greatest and most enterprising batsmen\" and by his captain Don Bradman as one of the great batsmen of the game. He was never dropped from the Australian Test team and was known for his footwork, mastery of fast bowling and the hook shot against the Bodyline strategy. He also regularly bowled medium-pace and often opened the bowling at a time when Australia lacked fast bowlers, using an off cutter. He was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1935.\n\nAt the age of 19, McCabe was called up for the 1930 tour of England despite being yet to score his maiden first-class century as the selectors chose the youngest ever team to leave Australia. McCabe made his first century in a warm-up match but struggled in his month in England, scoring only 51 runs. His performance began to improve after adjusting his technique and he played in all five Tests, although he continued to have problems converting starts into large scores, failing to make a century during the tour. McCabe managed to maintain his position over the next two home seasons, playing in all ten Tests, but failed to make a century, and after 15 Tests, his average was below 35 although he had become increasingly successful at first-class level.\n\nIn 1932–33, McCabe made his breakthrough at international level in the First Test of the infamous Bodyline series, scoring an unbeaten 187 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in only four hours as his teammates fell around him. McCabe attacked the bowling vigorously, hooking relentlessly. He ended the series as the only Australian other than Bradman to score a century. McCabe missed most of the next season due to illness, but was retained for the 1934 tour of England despite his interrupted preparation. He scored 2,078 runs and eight centuries for the tour, including his maiden Test century in England. Following the retirement of captain Bill Woodfull at the end of the tour, McCabe became Australia's vice-captain and held the post for the rest of his career.\n\nAfter missing most of the 1934–35 domestic season due to injury, McCabe scored an unbeaten 189 in the Second Test of the 1935–36 tour of South Africa, including a century in one session, taking Australia to the brink of a world record-breaking victory on a difficult final-day pitch in poor light before the match was called off. It was one of two Test centuries McCabe made on the tour. The following season, he made five fifties in the first four Tests before scoring a century to help Australia win the deciding final Test against the touring Englishmen. In the First Test of the 1938 tour of England, McCabe played what was regarded as his greatest innings, scoring 232 in four hours, including his last 72 in 28 minutes. Bradman regarded the innings as the greatest batting he ever saw. However, none of McCabe's three most famous innings resulted in an Australian victory; he has a reputation of being at his best when Australia was in difficulty.\n\nDuring the 1938 tour, McCabe had been generally unproductive and he missed much of the subsequent Australian season due to illness and only played sporadically thereafter before cricket was cancelled due to World War II. He served in the military in a clerical position for a year before he was discharged due to a chronic feet problems. McCabe was plagued by poor health in his middle age, and was hospitalised for a liver ailment shortly before his death. He died at the age of 58 after falling off a cliff adjacent to his home in Mosman. There was innuendo that it was a suicide, but the coroner ruled that it was an accident.\n\nMcCabe's paternal grandparents settled in Grenfell, New South Wales in the 1850s; his grandfather Constable Edward James McCabe was an Irish policeman who immigrated to Australia and served in the Victorian Police. Edward left the constabulary and moved from Melbourne to Grenfell after reports of a gold rush. Edward's wife Catherine was ambushed by bushrangers during her relocation to the town with her children three weeks later, but was unharmed. The bushrangers scoured the family's possessions, but left after finding nothing of value. Her obituary described her as \"one of the greatest of the pioneer women of the Australian bush, possessing all the qualities of self-sacrifice, resourcefulness, industry, determination, and courage that left their mark on the Australian race and laid the foundation of the nation\". Her grandson, one of 37 grandchildren, was likewise known for his fearless and courageous play on the cricket field against the most intimidating bowlers of his time.\n\nThe son of local barber William \"Bill\", McCabe was the third of four brothers, who grew up playing local cricket in his hometown. The siblings played with rudimentary equipment; a lump of wood was substituted for a bat and cork wrapped in socks improvised as cricket balls. The boys settled their differences in the traditional manner of boxing bouts, and they took their primary education at a Catholic convent staffed by nuns.\n\nAt the age of 14, McCabe won a scholarship to the Catholic St. Joseph's College, Hunters Hill in Sydney due to his sporting ability. Run by the Marist Brothers, the large school's centerpiece stone castle-like building overlooks Sydney Harbour. After a month in the Second XI, McCabe was promoted to the Senior First XI at 14 as an all-rounder. He did not make a good start, registering a duck in his first innings. However, he impressed observers with his ability to hit the ball precisely. McCabe was always short, and playing against boys three years his senior, he could not rely on brute force. Aside from playing cricket, he was also full-back in the school's championship winning Rugby union team in 1926. During his time at St Joseph's McCabe grew larger and batted more powerfully, and his exploits were regularly featured in the yearbook. In 1925, he struck his maiden century against Sydney Boys High School and score two more the following year. Such was his power that the backyard fence at the home of a friend had to be reinforced—McCabe's powerful square drives had been dislodging it. McCabe did not receive special coaching attention from the school's staff, who merely encouraged him to hit the ball hard and along the ground. In his later years at school, he was selected for Combined Great Public Schools of Sydney—a combined team from Sydney's private schools—for the state schoolboys' carnival. McCabe studied hard and placed first in the class in each of his three years at St Joseph's. At the end of 1926, he earned his Intermediate Certificate with five As and two Bs. McCabe then left school and became an accountant's assistant.\n\nHe returned to Grenfell at the end of the 1926, and spent two years playing for the Grenfell Juniors, alongside his brothers. During this time Grenfell were undefeated for two years, and McCabe regularly scored centuries against outclassed bowling, including one score of 260.\n\nIn 1927, McCabe's cricket came to high-level attention for the first time. Charlie Macartney, who had just retired from Test cricket, brought a team that included six internationals, to Grenfell. McCabe scored 17 and took 5/84 against them. Then state and future Australian selector Chappie Dwyer, who led a team of Sydney Grade Cricketers to play in the country town. The McCabe brothers defeated them, Stan scoring 19. Later, the Test leg spinner Arthur Mailey led a team that also included Test player Tommy Andrews to Grenfell, and McCabe scored 62, 35 and 62 not out in three innings against them. In the 1927–28 season, McCabe played for the Southern Districts against other regional sides within the state. He made 92 not out in one match, but failed to pass 12 in six other innings. Dwyer returned in 1927–28 and McCabe scored 70 against his team. Dwyer convinced McCabe's parents to allow their son to move to Sydney to further his cricket career.\n\nAt the start of the following season, McCabe appeared with the New South Wales Colts team in one match against Queensland, before being selected for the New South Wales Second XI to play their Victorian counterparts. McCabe scored 60 not out in the second innings and took a total of 6/100 for the match. He was selected to represent New South Wales in his first-class debut against Queensland in the 1928–29 Sheffield Shield season while the Test players competed against England. He made 60 and 34, and bowled 17 overs without success, but was later omitted when the Test players returned from international duty. In four first-class matches in his debut season, McCabe scored 197 runs at 32.83 and took a total of 1/111. McCabe played twice against the touring England cricket team led by Percy Chapman, once in a match at Goulburn for the Southern Districts of New South Wales, and the other time for his state, but managed only 24 runs in three innings.\n\nMcCabe settled in Sydney permanently in 1929, representing Mosman Cricket Club in Sydney Grade Cricket. His parents only allowed him to settle there permanently if Dwyer could help find him a job and lodgings, and McCabe subsequently began work in the accounting division of Colonial Mutual Insurance Company. Dwyer could only support one player and hard a hard decision in eventually turning down the second McCabe brother Les. Both Stan and Les were similar in batting ability but the former could also bowl.\n\nDuring the 1929–30 season, McCabe totalled 844 runs at 56.27, making him the second-highest runscorer behind Bradman, as New South Wales won the Sheffield Shield. Despite his consistency, McCabe had difficulty capitalising on his starts. He passed 50 on eight occasions in the first eight matches of the season, and reached 29 in ten of his 12 innings, but failed to make a century, falling seven times between 60 and 90.\n\nNevertheless, McCabe was selected to the 1930 tour of England under Bill Woodfull's Australian cricket team. The team was the then-youngest to have left Australian shores, and only four had previous experience on English soil. As a result, the team was dubbed \"Woodfull's kindergarten\". In the traditional warm-up matches before the team sailed for England, McCabe struck 103 against Tasmania, his maiden first-class century. One of the reasons that McCabe was chosen despite his lack of centuries was his medium pace bowling. At the time, Australia lacked fast bowlers and McCabe was seen as a makeshift opening bowler; he had taken 17 wickets at 30.82 for the season, including a career best of 5/36 against Queensland.\n\nOn his first overseas trip, McCabe struggled badly in his first four weeks in England. In six matches in that time, he scored only 51 runs at 7.28 and failed to take a wicket after being asked to bowl only 18 overs. After being dismissed in the last of these matches, McCabe came off the field and despondently said that he was going to retire. Teammate Clarrie Grimmett suggested that McCabe play with a fuller face of the bat, advice that the batsman accepted. McCabe's fortunes changed in the next match against Oxford University; he scored 91 and took 1/5 in an innings win. He added 65 in the next match against Hampshire and starred with both bat and ball against Cambridge University, the final tour match before the First Test. McCabe scored 96 before being run out, and took 4/25 and 4/60, which would remain his career best match bowling figures, as Australia completed a commanding innings victory.\n\nHe made his Test debut in the first match of the Ashes series at Trent Bridge, Nottingham. He took match figures of 2/65, his first wicket being Jack Hobbs, and in his first Test innings as a batsman, he hit the first ball for a boundary but was dismissed off the next ball, before scoring 49 in the second innings as Australia chased 428 for victory. McCabe and Don Bradman were scoring quickly and had taken the score to 3/229 when McCabe lofted Maurice Tate towards mid-on. Syd Copley, a member of the ground staff who was acting as a substitute fielder dived forward and took a difficult catch. McCabe's dismissal sparked a collapse of 7/104 as England took a 93-run win. McCabe scored 44 and an unbeaten 25 as Australia squared the series with a seven-wicket triumph in the Second Test at Lords. McCabe made 30 in a rain-affected draw in the Third Test, before scoring four and taking 4/41 in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford, removing Ranjitsinhji, Maurice Leyland, Maurice Tate and Ian Peebles to reduce England to 8/251 in another wash out. With the series locked at 1–1, the Fifth and final Test at The Oval was a timeless Test. McCabe scored his first Test half-century of 54 as Australia piled on 695 to win by an innings and reclaim the Ashes 2–1. McCabe took one wicket in the deciding match, bowling leading English batsman Wally Hammond for 13. In all, McCabe scored 210 runs at 35.00 and took eight wickets at 27.62 in the Tests, and aggregated 1012 runs at 32.64 and took 26 wickets at 27.80 for the whole tour. This made him the fifth highest run-scorer for the tour. However, he was unable to register a century on tour, his highest score being 96. He continued his habit of failing to convert his starts into centuries in the tour matches after the start of the Tests. In one stretch of eight county innings, he registered scores between 34 and 79 seven times, and he ended with seven fifties for the tour. Nevertheless, \"Wisden\" praised his attacking ability to disrupt the length of opposition bowlers. On two occasions, McCabe took more than two wickets in an innings.\n\nUpon his return to Australia, McCabe played all five Tests against the West Indies in 1930–31. He scored 90 in the First Test at the Adelaide Oval as Australia took victory by ten wickets. However, he struggled thereafter, scoring 31, eight and two as Australia won the next three matches by an innings. He managed 21 and 44 as the tourists took their only Test victory of their first Test tour to Australia. McCabe totalled 196 runs at 32.66 and took three wickets at 42.00. However, he managed a century against the West Indies for New South Wales in the latter part of the season and scored 161 and 53 in a match against Queensland. He took 4/46 in a Shield match against Victoria, removing Test players Hunter Hendry, Keith Rigg, Len Darling and Ted a'Beckett. Overall, McCabe finished the season with 705 runs at 41.47 and 16 wickets at 35.00.\n\nThe following year, McCabe scored centuries in all of his three Sheffield Shield innings, scoring 229* Queensland at Brisbane and 106 and 103* in one match against Victoria in Sydney, yielding a Shield season average of 438.00. His innings against Queensland was particularly lauded, showcasing his ability against the most hostile of fast bowling. Queensland's attack was led by Eddie Gilbert, an indigenous paceman who was the fastest in Australia and whom Bradman said was the fastest that he had ever faced. On one occasion, a particularly fast Gilbert delivery supposedly evaded both the batsman and wicket-keeper, travelled more than 60 metres and crashed through a fence before hitting and killing a dog on the other side. On this day, Gilbert knocked the bat out of Bradman's hand before removing him for a duck. Gilbert cut down the New South Wales top order with a spell of 3/12 and forced Alan Kippax to retire hurt after hitting him in the upper body. This left New South Wales at effectively 4/21. Undeterred, McCabe came in and bravely counterattacked in a display that featured many aggressive hook and cut shots. The visitors made 432 before McCabe took a total of 3/27 to help his state take an innings win as the hosts were bowled out for 109 and 85. In the match against arch-rivals and defending champions Victoria, McCabe added 3/57 and 1/18 with the ball as New South Wales won by 239 runs, and went on to claim the title, despite McCabe not being able to contribute in final match of the season; he injured himself while in the field and was unable to bat in a 132-run defeat at the hands of South Australia.\n\nMcCabe was unable to translate the success into the Test arena, where McCabe struggled despite his team's 5–0 sweep over South Africa. McCabe warmed up for the series by scoring 37 and 79 not out and totalling 3/108 in a state match against the tourists. After managing only 27 in an innings victory in the First Test, McCabe saved his most productive Test of the summer for his home crowd for the Second Test at Sydney. He took 4/13 in the first innings, bowling or trapping all of his victims leg before wicket, and then compiled 79 as Australia cruised to another innings win. McCabe scored 22 and 71 and took two wickets in the Third Test win in Melbourne, but managed only two runs and three wickets in the last two Tests, which Australia won by an innings. McCabe ended the series with 201 runs at 33.50 and nine wickets at 22.77. McCabe ended the season with 783 runs at 87.00 and 19 wickets at 23.94.\n\nDuring the Australian winter of 1932, former Test leg spinner Arthur Mailey organised and managed a tour of prominent Australian players, of whom McCabe was one, to North America. They played 51 matches in 100 days, none of which were first-class; most were one-day matches, although not limited overs. McCabe played in 48 of the matches; he scored eight centuries and averaged 54 with the bat. He took seven or more wickets in an innings 12 times including 12 in one innings, and totalled 189 wickets at an average of six.\n\nMcCabe made his breakthrough in the following Australian season in 1932–33, which went down in history due to England's use of the controversial \"Bodyline\" tactics. In the lead-up to the Tests, McCabe scored 43, 67 and 19 in two tour matches against the Englishmen.\n\nIn the First Test in Sydney, with England captain Douglas Jardine again employed Bodyline. This involved constant intimidatory short-pitched leg-side bowling with a leg-cordon to catch balls fended off by the batsman, in an attempt to curtail Donald Bradman, generally regarded as the best batsman ever, from scoring. McCabe came to the wicket on the first day, the score at 3/82 with Bill Woodfull, Bill Ponsford and Jack Fingleton already dismissed, and Bradman not playing due to illness. Having warned his parents, who were watching him in Test cricket for the only time, not to jump the fence if he was hit, McCabe took guard. Jardine had deployed seven men on the leg-side, usually with five close catchers and two men patrolling the boundary for hook shots. McCabe hooked the first ball he received from Bodyline spearhead Harold Larwood for a boundary. After Kippax fell with the score at 87, McCabe and Vic Richardson added 129 before Richardson fell. McCabe reached stumps at 127 not out with the total 6/290. His innings was marked by dangerous cutting and compulsive hooking of short-pitched deliveries in front of his face, unfazed by the repeated body blows which hit his teammates.\n\nMcCabe's attack forced Jardine to abandon his Bodyline approach. Jardine removed Larwood from the attack and brought on Gubby Allen. Under the professional-amateur divide of the time, England's captain was always an amateur, and professionals, such as Larwood, were obliged to obey the captain's orders. Allen was an amateur who refused to bowl Bodyline. McCabe struck three consecutive fours from Allen's conventional fast bowling, prompting Jardine to call for Bodyline field placings. Allen refused, so Jardine was forced to drop his Bodyline attack and resort to the spin bowling of Hedley Verity and Wally Hammond. The crowd responded to his instinctive aggression with wild cheering. McCabe said that \"it was really an impulsive, senseless innings, a gamble that should not have been made but came off against all the odds\".\n\nMcCabe scored 60 of the 70 runs that Australia added on the second day to finish 187 not out from 233 balls as Australia were bowled out for 360. McCabe added the runs in just one hour of batting and ended with 25 boundaries in his innings, which lasted a little over four hours. He was particularly effectively in farming the strike while batting with his tail end partners; in his last wicket stand of 55 with Tim Wall, he scored 50 of the runs in just half an hour.\n\nHe was praised by Larwood, who spearheaded the Bodyline attack and totalled 10/128 for the match, which ended in a decisive 10-wicket victory for England. Wisden reported that McCabe \"scored off Larwood's bowling in a style which for daring and brilliance was not approached by any other Australian during the tour\". Richard Whitington wrote in the 1970s that McCabe's innings \"still warms the blood of the dwindling number of Australians who watched it\". McCabe received a thunderous standing ovation from the 46,000 spectators. Immediately after the innings, McCabe told his teammates that he would never be able to replicate the feat because it was too difficult to hook the ball consistently without hitting it up into the air and giving away catching opportunities.\n\nUmpire George Hele, who officiated the match said:\n\nAustralia's captain Woodfull refused to retaliate and England made 524 in reply, McCabe having Jardine caught behind for 27 to end with 1/42. McCabe was one of the few Australians to make any impact in the second innings, making 32 as Australia fell for 164.\n\nMcCabe was unable to repeat his performances in the later Tests. He made 32 and a duck as Australia gained its only victory in the Second Test in Melbourne, before managing only 57 runs in the next four innings as Australia suffered consecutive defeats. He scored 73 in the first innings of the Fifth Test in Sydney as Australia compiled 435, but scored only four in a second innings collapse, leaving England with an eight-wicket victory. He had persisted with his strategy of standing his ground attacking the \"Bodyline\" bowling, but was unsuccessful.\n\nMcCabe totalled 385 runs at 42.78 for the series and was the only Australian batsman other than Bradman to score a century, as the English decisively won the series 4–1. He took three wickets at 71.66, and opened the bowling in some of the matches due to Australia's lack of fast bowling. It was a far cry from the intimidation that Bodyline provided.\n\nAway from the tumult of Bodyline, McCabe played in five of New South Wales' six Sheffield Shield matches, and he scored 348 runs at 49.71 with four fifties and took 11 wickets at 17.54. New South Wales won four of these matches and drew the other to retain their title. His most prominent effort was a 91 and a match total of 5/41 in an innings win over Queensland.\n\nThe 1933–34 season started well for McCabe. He started the season with scores of 20, 82, 110 and 8 in three matches in November, the century coming against the Rest of Australia. However, he was hampered by illness, which forced him to have an operation, which sidelined him for more than three months. The selectors nevertheless chose him for the 1934 tour of England, and McCabe returned to make 119 and 27 in two matches for the touring party against Tasmania before they departed for the northern hemisphere.\n\nReturning to England in 1934, McCabe scored 2,078 runs at 69.28 including eight centuries on the tour, more than any of his teammates. In the second match of the tour against Leicestershire, McCabe scored the century that had eluded him four years earlier, finishing 108 not out. He then scored 192 against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's, combining with Ponsford in a record partnership for the third wicket of 389, in what was effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests; the MCC fielded almost a full-strength England team. McCabe put in an all round performance against Hampshire, scoring 79 and taking 4/79 in the first innings. In the next match, he scored 240, the highest of his career, against Surrey at The Oval. In the next match, the last fixture before the Tests, McCabe made 142 against Lancashire.\n\nIn the First Test at Trent Bridge, McCabe made 65 in the first innings before scoring 88 in the second innings to extend Australia's first innings lead from 106 to a target of 380. The hosts fell short by 238 runs. Between Tests, McCabe registered his fifth century of the season, making an unbeaten 105 in the second innings as Australia defeated the Gentlemen of England by eight wickets. McCabe then scored 34 and 19 as England struck back with an innings victory at Lord's. Between Tests, he took 4/24 in a six-wicket win over Surrey. He then scored his first Test century on English soil during the high-scoring draw in the Third Test at Old Trafford, compiling 137 and 33 not out. The hosts gave McCabe a taste of his own medicine, and he had to bowl 45 overs for a match total of 1/133, as England's batsmen totalled 10/750 for the match.\n\nMcCabe made 27 in the rain-affected draw in the Fourth Test, the culmination of a quiet fortnight in which he failed to pass 30. He then scored fifties in three consecutive tour matches before the Fifth Test, which was timeless as the series was tied 1–1. McCabe scored 10 and 70 and took 2/5 in the second innings as Australia won the match by 562 runs to regain the Ashes 2–1. McCabe aggregated 483 runs at 60.37 and took four wickets in the Tests. At the time, Wisden said of him: \"He blossomed forth as an almost completely equipped batsman of the forcing type and was probably the best exponent—Bradman himself scarcely excluded—of the art of hitting the ball tremendously hard and safely.\" Wisden said that McCabe had made \"immense strides\" in his batting technique. It said \"In 1930 he gave the impression of still having a good deal to learn; he was inclined to be somewhat slapdash in his methods. The intervening years had clearly made a great difference in him. Losing nothing of his power, he displayed a wider and safer range of strokes.\" McCabe finished the tour with 108 against Kent and 124 in an innings win over HDG Leveson-Gower's XI a took 21 wickets for the entire season.\n\nMcCabe spent most of the 1934–35 Australian season watching from the sidelines. The first match of the summer was a testimonial for retiring Australian captain Woodfull. McCabe was forced to retire hurt when on five, and he missed more than two months of cricket. He returned for only one match, scoring 92 and 53 as New South Wales were defeated by arch-rivals Victoria.\n\nThe following Australian season he became captain of New South Wales following the retirement of Kippax and the departure of Bradman to South Australia. However, with Australia touring South Africa in 1935–36, McCabe did not represent his state. However, he was made vice-captain to Vic Richardson for the tour, with Woodfull and Ponsford having retired, and Bradman ill. McCabe enjoyed more success, heading the Test batting figures with 420 runs at 84.00. After scoring 24, 65 and 29 in three warm-up matches, all of which were won by innings, McCabe hit 149 in the First Test at Durban, sharing a second-wicket partnership of 161 with Bill Brown in gale-force conditions which caused balls to make U-turns in the headwind, forced the umpires to glue the bails to the wickets using chewing gum, to set up a nine-wicket victory. In the following Test in Johannesburg, McCabe made 34 as Australia took a first innings lead of 93. However, Dudley Nourse scored 235 to help the hosts to 491; McCabe removed Nourse and ended with 2/30. Australia were set a Test world record target of 399 in the second innings to achieve victory on a turning wicket, and McCabe told captain Richardson that he would not be able to bat or run between wickets effectively because of altitude sickness. Regarding McCabe was his most important batsman, Richardson implored him to bat and told him to simply stand his ground and hit boundaries so that he would not have to run. McCabe joined Fingleton at 1/17 before taking the score to 1/85 by the end of the third day. The following morning in poor visibility on a wicket with irregular bounce and lateral deviation, McCabe resumed on 38 and scored a century in the morning session to reach lunch at 138, after Fingleton was dismissed at 2/194. The pair had put on 177 runs for the second wicket, and McCabe had done more than four fifths of the scoring. McCabe had reached his century in only 90 minutes, and continued on despite a storm that brought low dust clouds and hindered visibility, and increasingly irregular bounce and cut off the pitch. Midway through the afternoon, dark clouds gathered, along with thunderstorms and lightning, but this had no effect on the batsman. McCabe pushed the score to 2/274, and with only 125 runs needed with half the day remaining, Australia were on course to meet the target, having already scored 189 in the first half. However, Herbie Wade, the South African captain made an unprecedented appeal against the light due fear \"for the fieldsmen's safety\" in the face of McCabe's aggressive batting. He finished unbeaten on 189, an innings described by Fingleton as \"bordering on miraculous\". McCabe struck 24 fours, and was productive square of the wicket, hitting numerous cut shots past point. Fingleton further added that “McCabe never put a foot or his bat in a false position”, and that he “pulverized the South African attack into the dust”. McCabe was unable to maintain such a standard of performance in the remaining three Tests; he scored a duck, 40 and one, as Australia won each by an innings. He ended the series with three wickets at 45.33. However, he scored consecutive centuries in the tour matches, adding 115 and 112 against Border and Orange Free State.\n\nThe following year, having been appointed Bradman's vice-captain, McCabe had a successful Ashes series in 1936–37. McCabe scored 76, 28, 23, 83 and 46 in the lead-up, but started the series poorly; he made 51 in the first innings but managed only seven as Australia was caught out on a sticky wicket on the final day and were bowled out for 58 to lose the First Test in Brisbane by 322 runs. He then made a duck as Australia was again caught on a sticky by a thunderstorm during the first innings of the Second Test in Sydney. He made 93 in the second innings but Australia was unable to overcome the first innings deficit of 346 after being forced to follow on and fell to an innings defeat.\n\nAfter the Second Test, McCabe was involved in an infamous incident that has caused speculation ever since. His captain Bradman was known for his reserved personality, did not drink and often eschewed social activities with teammates, preferring to privately listen to music or read. Combined with his success, Bradman gained a reputation for cockiness. In the 1930s, Australia had been divided along sectarian lines, with a sizeable Irish Catholic minority that included McCabe often pitted against Anglicans and/or Protestants such as Bradman (of Anglo-Irish descent), particularly practitioners of Freemasonry, leading to speculation that the tension was fuelled by religion. Four of the five Catholics in the team, McCabe, leading bowler Bill O'Reilly, along with Leo O'Brien and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith were summoned by the Board of Control to respond to allegations that they were undermining Bradman. Bradman denied having prior knowledge of the meeting, although the alleged infighting was reported in the press. Opening batsman Jack Fingleton was not invited, speculated to be due to his journalistic background, but Bradman later alleged that he was the ringleader. After that, Bradman's relationship with O'Reilly and Fingleton never recovered. During the meeting, players were variously accused of undermining Bradman's authority, laziness, lack of attention to fitness, but the board refused to specifically accuse those summoned. The details were leaked to the media, but the board denied that the meeting had taken place. Bradman denied that he was anti-Catholic, saying that O'Reilly and Fingleton wanted to depose him from the captaincy and install McCabe in his place.\n\nAustralia were now 0–2 down and needed to win three Tests in a row to retain the Ashes. The pressure on McCabe increased when last-minute injuries meant that he had to open the bowling. McCabe made 63 and 22 and took a wicket as Australia won their first match in the series. He then top-scored with 88 in Australia's first innings of 288 and made 55 in the second as Australia won by 148 runs in the Fourth Test in Adelaide to level the series. In the deciding Test at the MCG, McCabe scored 112, one of three centuries as Australia amassed 604, a record score in Ashes Tests in Australia. This laid the platform for the innings victory that retained the Ashes. McCabe aggregated 491 runs in five Tests at 54.55, with a century and five fifties in a consistent display.\n\nMcCabe assumed the New South Wales captaincy from the 1936–37 season onwards. Due to international commitments, McCabe was represented his state only three times, but they were undefeated, winning both of their matches against England. McCabe scored a fifty in each of the matches.\n\nIn 1937–38, no international matches were scheduled, and McCabe played a full season with New South Wales, leading them to the Sheffield Shield title, with three wins and three draws. He started the Shield season with consecutive centuries against Queensland and South Australia, and finished with 83 and 122 in two warm-up matches for Australia before they departed for England. McCabe totalled 720 runs at 45.00 for the season, with three centuries and three fifties, and took eight wickets at 24.62.\n\nThe 1938 Ashes Tour of England was McCabe's last for Australia. He was again appointed vice-captain for the tour. In the second tour match, McCabe scored 110 in an innings win over Oxford University. His 50 against Essex in the final match before the Tests was the only other fifty in the first nine matches, in which he scored 301 runs at 37.62. He took a total of 4/50 in an innings win over Northamptonshire. McCabe's lean run with the bat was causing concern for the Australians, as the other batsmen had been productive.\n\nMcCabe's most highly rated innings came in the First Test at Trent Bridge. England compiled 8/658 before declaring late on the second day, and McCabe had toiled for 21 overs without success. McCabe arrived at the crease with the dismissal of Bradman at 2/111 to join Brown, and after two unsuccessful appeals against the light, he was 19 at the close of play after 35 minutes of batting with the total at 3/138, having seen Brown dismissed for 48. McCabe had struck three boundaries by this stage, two cut shots and an on drive, and had survived a final spell from fast bowler Ken Farnes without a sightscreen, accompanied by nightwatchman Frank Ward.\n\nThe next morning, England's bowlers continued to make regular inroads. Ward fell in the third over of the day, and the debutant Lindsay Hassett was dismissed soon after, leaving Australia at 5/150. McCabe, who had hit two boundaries thus far in the morning, was joined by Jack Badcock. The former continued to score boundaries regularly, and hit Sinfield for four and three from a leg glance and late cut to reach his 50 in 90 minutes. He then hit Hammond for consecutive on-driven fours before Badcock fell at 6/194, having made only 9 of the 43 runs in their partnership. McCabe had struck 62 of the 83 runs added since he had come to the crease. With all the other specialist batsmen dismissed, McCabe was now batting with wicket-keeper Ben Barnett and began to attack the English bowlers with powerful drives and hook shots. Hammond brought back Farnes to try and finish off the tail, but McCabe responded by hitting three fours in one over, forcing the English captain to remove his fast bowler after McCabe had hooked him for six.\n\nDespite Hammond's best attempts, McCabe was able to gain the strike and runs came quickly. McCabe reached his century in 140 minutes and England declined to take the new ball while he was batting. By lunch, he and Barnett had added 67 in only 50 minutes, although the latter had made only 20 of these; the total was 6/261, with McCabe on 105. Having reached his century, McCabe lifted his scoring rate, scoring his last 132 runs in 95 minutes. Boundaries came much more readily and he took 44 runs from a three over spell by leg spinner Doug Wright. As he ran out of partners, he became more aggressive; in the last ten overs of his innings, he took 80% of the strike and hit 16 boundaries. He was the last man out, attempting to loft the spin of Verity, after a final wicket partnership with Leslie Fleetwood-Smith of 77 in 28 minutes, of which he scored 72. He finished with 232 from 235 minutes with 34 boundaries and one six, an innings in which Bradman summoned his players not to miss a ball, as \"they would never see anything like it again.\" Bradman later said that McCabe \"held us all spellbound\", and it was reported that the Australian captain trembled while watching the innings. While McCabe was at the crease, his partners contributed a total of only 58 runs, meaning that he had outscored them by a ratio of 4:1. Upon his return to the pavilion Bradman greeted him with the words: \"If I could play an innings like that, I'd be a proud man, Stan\". This has also been reported as Bradman saying \" I wish I could bat like that\". Bradman later wrote that \"Towards the end [of McCabe's innings] I could scarcely watch the play. My eyes filled as I drank in the glory of his shots\". It was regarded by English captains Arthur Gilligan and Bob Wyatt to be the best innings that they had ever witnessed, as did former England bowler Sydney Barnes—regarded as one of the best of all time—who said that he would not have been able to stop McCabe. Neville Cardus said that the innings was one of the greatest in Test history. Wisden reported that McCabe played \"an innings the equal of which has probably never been seen in the history of Test cricket; for the best part of four hours he maintained a merciless punishment of the bowling\". McCabe's biographer Jack McHarg said that the innings “was a sort of encyclopedia of attacking batsmanship, a triumph of character, technique and judgement”. Cardus said\n\nThe innings was not enough to avert the follow on, and in the second innings, McCabe made 39 as Australia made 6/427 and the match petered into a draw. After the Test, McCabe scored 79 and took a total of 4/20 in a victory over the Gentlemen of England.\n\nMcCabe followed his efforts at Trent Bridge with 38 and 21 in the drawn Second Test at Lord's. He bowled heavily in the match, sending down 43 overs and taking a total of 2/144 as Bradman's specialist bowlers struggled to make inroads. In the first two Tests, McCabe had taken a combined total of 2/208 from 64 overs. The Third Test at Old Trafford was abandoned before it started due to rain, and McCabe contributed only one and 15 as Australia scrambled to a five-wicket win to retain the Ashes in the low-scoring Fourth Test at Headingley after chasing a target of 105 on the third day. It was part of a three-week run in which McCabe failed to pass 15 in six innings and did not take a wicket. McCabe made fifties in the two first-class matches before the Fifth and final Test at The Oval, where Australia played an extra batsman, meaning that McCabe opened the bowling. He took 0/85 from 38 overs, and with Bradman and Fingleton injuring themselves during the match, McCabe was left in control of a nine-man team. England piled on 7/903 declared in three days before defeating Australia by an innings and 579 runs, the largest winning margin in Test history. This included a world record score of 364 by Len Hutton, who was dropped by wicket-keeper Ben Barnett from McCabe's bowling before reaching 50. Neither Bradman nor Fingleton were able to bat. McCabe made 14 and two, and finished the series with 362 runs at 45.25. McCabe scored 91 and 58 in tour matches against an England XI and the Leveson-Gower's XI to finish the English summer.\n\nMcCabe's Test career ended after the tour at just 28 years of age, due to a combination of chronic foot injuries and the intervention of World War II—England's scheduled 1940–41 tour never materialised and international cricket did not resume until 1946. McCabe had also been in poor form apart from his double century at Trent Bridge and there was speculation that he was in decline. His feet had high insteps that meant that when he stood normally, his toes would not touch the floor. Curiously, none of his three most celebrated innings at Trent Bridge, Johannesburg nor Sydney resulted in an Australian victory. O'Reilly said that \"All three of them were the greatest innings I have watched\".\n\nUpon returning to Australia, McCabe continued to captain New South Wales, but only played in two matches during the 1938–39 season due to illness, scoring 141 runs at 47.00 including one century. In the first match, to celebrate the centenary of the Melbourne Cricket Club, he struck 105 in only 140 minutes and timed the ball well, but made 35 and 1 in the first Shield match and then absented himself from the rest of the season. McCabe had always been susceptible to illness and was dogged for much of 1938 and 1939. In his absence, New South Wales surrendered their title to South Australia, but they regained the mantle in 1939–40 upon the return of their captain. In his first match back, McCabe scored 98 to guide New South Wales to a three-wicket win over Queensland. After losing their next two matches, McCabe's men won their last three matches to take the title. The captain scored 59 and 55 and 49 and 114 in the last two matches against South Australia and Victoria respectively. A match between the Shield champions and the Rest of Australia was arranged and McCabe scored 72 and 96, steering his team to a narrow two-wicket win. He ended the season with 699 runs at 53.76 from seven matches, with a century and six fifties.\n\nThe 1940–41 was to be McCabe's last full season, although the Shield competition was not held and matches stood alone. This was unfortunate for McCabe and his men, as they won all five of their matches. McCabe scored 88 and 57 as New South Wales scraped past Queensland by 27 runs in the season opening match, before scoring 53 in the runchase as his team defeated a combined Queensland and Victorian team by only one wicket. McCabe added two further half-centuries and ended the season with a win over arch-rivals Victoria. He had scored 432 runs at 48.00. Due to the outbreak of World War II in Europe in September 1939, the scheduled England tour of Australia was cancelled.\n\nIn 1941–42, McCabe played his final first-class match. He scored 8 and 41 as Queensland took a 17-run win. Ten days later, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, prompting the start of the war in the Pacific. With that, first-class cricket was cancelled and did not resume until 1945–46, ending McCabe's career at the age of just 31. He had 24 wins and four losses in 38 first-class matches as captain for all teams. In his last three seasons, McCabe took only one wicket, from 18 overs of bowling.\n\nAustralian teammate Clarrie Grimmett, regarded as one of the greatest spinners of all time, regarded McCabe as technically superior to Bradman, feeling that the latter's success was largely due to his extreme concentration and determination. Fellow state and Australian batsman Bill Brown described McCabe as the \"finest strokeplayer I ever saw\", further adding \"When Stan was in command, he was so magnificent to watch, and he left everyone, including Bradman, for dead. Certainly Bradman scored more runs, but Stan was the batsman you most wanted to be.\"\n\nThe leading English batsman Hutton said that McCabe had several qualities in his batsmanship that were superior to those of Bradman, concluding that \"It would be harder to think of a greater Australian batsman\". The leading English cricket writer Neville Cardus said that \"Genial, friendly, Stan was Australia’s most gallant and knightly batsman since Victor Trumper. In his brilliant strokeplay there was a certain courtliness. In his most aggressive innings, there was no brutality; his bat was never used as a bludgeon.\" E. W. Swanton said that McCabe was from \"the heroic mould\" and that \"like those of Hobbs, Macartney and Woolley were essentially qualitative\" and that McCabe \"came as near as any player to one’s conception of the perfect cricketer\".\n\nThe leading Australian cricket writer of the time, Ray Robinson said that \"In McCabe the cricketer, you saw McCabe the man—urbane, sociable, unpretentious, straightforward, incapable of anything mean-spirited. In all the pre-war Test series he was the best liked by both his own team and his opponents.\"\n\nMcCabe was briefly a member of the Australian Defence Force during the Second World War, joining in late 1942. Due to his poor health and feet, he knew that his utility would be limited, and he also had a newborn son and fledgling business at the time, so he had not rushed to enlist at the start of the war. Due to McCabe's incapacitation, he was given a clerical job at the Victoria Barracks. He stayed in the role for 12 months before his feet problems resulted in an early discharge. He was appointed to serve on the Sydney Sports Ground and Cricket Ground Trust and operated a sports store in George Street, Sydney from its opening until his death. McCabe often hired cricketing colleagues as salesmen; his close friend O'Reilly worked there in the late-1930s, as did paceman Ray Lindwall after the war, Lindwall opted to work for McCabe because he was offered leave to travel overseas for Test tours.\n\nMcCabe ran for an administrative position with his local club Mosman after his retirement, but was defeated, so he never had an opportunity to serve with the NSWCA. After the end of his first-class career, McCabe became a keen recreational golfer, but stopped playing in the mid-1950s due to his foot problems and other health issues. In 1956–57, McCabe and O'Reilly were given a testimonial match by the New South Wales Cricket Association. The match was between Harvey's XI and Lindwall's XI and acted as a trial for the non-Test tour of New Zealand. The match raised 7,500 pounds, which was split between McCabe and O'Reilly, and would have bought two average-sized homes in Sydney at the time.\n\nMcCabe married Edna May Linton on 5 February 1935 at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, and the couple had two children, a son and a daughter, born in 1939 and 1950 respectively. The devout McCabe sent both of his children to Catholic boarding schools even though the family home was nearby. Plagued by ill-health in his middle age, McCabe's fitness was further hindered by his feet, which prevented him from exercising. He thus gained a lot of weight, and heavy smoking wore down his body, as did the large number of people who wanted to meet him. McCabe weakened significantly in the last two years of his life and was hospitalised for a period for liver problems. He was released from hospital soon before his death, but still aged 58, was a very frail man who moved very tentatively.\n\nMcCabe died of a skull fracture after falling from a cliff at his home in Mosman, New South Wales after attempting to dispose of a dead possum. He had earlier told Dwyer of his plan to clean out his backyard, and was told to rest, but did so anyway, falling down and rolling off the steep slope in his backyard and over the ledge of the cliff abutting the rear of his house. There was innuendo that McCabe had actually committed suicide, with O'Reilly musing \"He had despatched the possum, but had gone overboard with it!\". However, the coroner ruled that the death was accidental and his family strongly denied that he had chosen to end his life. The coroner's investigation noted that McCabe's hands had tufts of ripped grass in them, indicating that he had tried to grab onto vegetation in a vain attempt to stop his fall.\n\nNews of McCabe's death was made public while Australia and England were playing in the Fifth Test at The Oval. After the death was announced over the public address system, the crowd spontaneously stood up and took off their hats, and did the players, and they observed a self-initiated moment of silence. However, McCabe's friend and former teammate Fingleton, now a journalist, criticised the Australian team for not wearing black armbands.\n\nMcCabe was buried in Northern Suburbs cemetery. In 1977, the Stan McCabe Sporting Complex was opened in Grenfell as part of the new high school, and the oval was named in his honour. The complex included grounds and facilities for a number of sports. He was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\n"}

He is best known for a short stint as caretaker coach of the Brisbane Bears in 1989.\n\nEarly in his career, Feltham played for Box Hill in the VFA in 1967, Eastlake Football Club in the ACTAFL and Balmain Football Club in the NSWAFL. His talent was his tough, courageous determination and his quick handball. Feltham played as a winger and midfielder North Melbourne from 1970 to 1976. He played in the 1974 VFL Grand Final and was one of the best players in North Melbourne Football Club's first Premiership in 1975. He later joined Richmond in 1978, but his best football games were played at North Melbourne Football club during the '70s.\n\nFeltham captain-coached Mordialloc in 1979, then left to coach West Canberra in 1980.\n\nLater in the 1980s he moved to Queensland, where he coached the University of Southern Queensland's Australian football team to back to back premierships in the Darling Downs AFL competition in 1986 and 1987 and the Morningside Football Club (QAFL), before joining the underperforming Brisbane Bears in a part-time role as sports psychologist for the 1989 season.\n\nWhen incumbent coach Peter Knights was sacked with seven games remaining in the season, Feltham was surprisingly appointed caretaker coach ahead of any of the existing coaching panel. The Bears immediately rallied to win five of the remaining matches, which included an upset win over the eventual premiers Hawthorn, who only lost three matches over the home and away season.\n\nFeltham was not considered for the permanent coaching position for the following season, reportedly due to a clash with particular senior players and certain club personnel, most notably football manager Shane O'Sullivan. He was replaced by another caretaker coach, former coaching assistant and ex-Fitzroy player Norm Dare, for the 1990 season while the search for a permanent coach continued for 1991.\n\nFor most of the 1990s he disappeared from the spotlight, but reappeared in 1999 as an applicant for the vacant coaching role with Woodville-West Torrens. He applied for the same position again the following season. He also applied for the coaching role with Hawthorn in 2004. He was unsuccessful in each of these applications.\n\nHe is currently based in Canada, where he is coach of the London Magpies Australian Football Club, and is also a sports psychologist with AFL Canada's national side, the Northwind.\n"}

{"id": "2270656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270656", "title": "Nephridium", "text": "Nephridium\n\nThe nephridium (plural \"nephridia\") is an invertebrate organ, found in pairs and performing a function similar to the vertebrate kidney. Nephridia remove metabolic wastes from an animal's body. In addition to two basic categories (metanephridia and protonephridia), other types may exist.\n\nA metanephridium (\"meta\" = \"after\") is a type of excretory gland found in many types of invertebrates such as annelids, arthropods and mollusca. (In mollusca, it is known as the Bojanus organ.)\n\nA metanephridium typically consists of a ciliated funnel opening into the body cavity, or coelom connected to a duct which may be variously glandularized, folded or expanded (vesiculate) and which typically opens to the organism's exterior. These ciliated tubules pump water carrying surplus ions, metabolic waste, toxins from food, and useless hormones out of the organism by directing them down funnel-shaped bodies called nephrostomes. This waste is passed out of the organism at the nephridiopore. The primary urine produced by filtration of blood (or a similar functioning fluid) is modified into secondary urine through selective reabsorption by the cells lining the metanephridium.\n\nThe saccate metanephridia are excretory glands which function similarly to the metanephridia. They are found in the arthropod's: coxal glands of arachnids, antennal (or green) glands and maxillary glands of crustaceans, etc.\n\nThe saccate metanephridia filter the fluid of the hemocoel, as opposed to the metanephridia which filter coelomic fluid. In a saccate metanephridium, there is a ciliated funnel covered with a membrane that helps to filter the hemocoel of heavy particles (such as proteins and carbohydrates) before the fluid even enters the funnel. Inside the funnel, the fluid is further processed through selective reabsorption, and eventually excreted from the nephridiopore.\n\nIn Crustacea, the saccate metanephridia are associated with the antennae and form the antennal gland. In freshwater crustacea, the saccate metanephridia are especially large due to their role in osmoregulation; crustacea must remove large amounts of water from the tissues, as the cells are hypertonic to the surrounding water.\n\nA protonephridium (\"proto\" = \"first\") is a network of dead-end tubules lacking internal openings, found in the phyla Platyhelminthes, Nemertea, Rotifera and Chordata (lancelets). The ends are called \"flame cells\" (if ciliated) or \"solenocytes\" (if flagellated); they function in osmoregulation (ionoregulation). The terminal cells are located at the blind end of the protonephridium. Each cell has one or more cilia and their beating inside the protonephridial tube creates an outward going current and hence a partial pressurization in the blind of the tube. Because of this, pressurization drives waste fluids from the inside of the animal, and they are pulled through small perforations in the terminal cells and into the protonephridium. The perforations in the terminal cell are large enough for small molecules to pass, but larger proteins are retained within the animal. From the bottom of the protonephridium the solutes are led through the tube, formed by the canal cells, and exits the animal from a small opening formed by the nephridiopore. Selective reabsorption of useful molecules by the canal cells occurs as the solutes pass down the tubule. Protonephridia are generally found in basal organisms such as flatworms. Protonephridia likely first arose as a way to cope with a hypotonic environment by removing excess water from the organism (osmoregulation). Their use as excretory and ionoregulatory structures likely arose secondarily.\n\nThese are excretory systems in phyla Platyhelminthes and are also called blind tubules. These tubules bear a tuft of cilia or flagellum. An organ of excretion in flatworms: a hollow cup-shaped cell containing a bunch of cilia or flagellum, whose movement draws in waste products and wafts them to the outside through a connecting tubule.\n\n"}

{"id": "2270667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270667", "title": "Mount Sutro", "text": "Mount Sutro\n\nMount Sutro is a hill in central San Francisco, California. It was originally named Mount Parnassus.\n\nThe low mountain is in elevation. Mount Sutro is one of the many named hills within San Francisco, and among its original \"Seven Hills\".\n\nMost of Mount Sutro is owned by the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). A parcel, including the summit, is protected as the Mount Sutro Open Space Reserve by UCSF, and open to the public.\n\nSutro Tower, a large television and radio broadcasting tower for the San Francisco Bay Area and very visible City landmark, is not on Mount Sutro. It stands on a lower hill to the south between it and Twin Peaks.\n\nMount Sutro has been covered by a dense forest, with about 80% being introduced eucalyptus trees, that was planted in the late 19th century. The older trees are now over tall. The mountain is within San Francisco's fog belt, receiving fog throughout the summer. The tall trees precipitate the fog, with the moisture being absorbed by the duff and tree roots, and the forest remains damp through the summer months. It receives some 30 to 40% of its moisture from fog drip. There is a dense understory of non-native Himalayan blackberry (\"Rubus armeniacus\") and several other plants. The forest provides habitat for a number of bird species, including great horned owls and various woodpeckers. Over thirty species were recorded in a single morning of bird watching.\n\nThe city-owned portion of Mount Sutro and the eucalyptus forest, called the Interior Green Belt, is contiguous with the UCSF-owned Mount Sutro Open Space Reserve portion. The forest is bounded on the north by the UCSF Medical Center and the UCSF Stem-cell Research Building; on the west by the Sunset District; on the south by the Forest Knolls neighborhood, built in the late 1950s on cleared forest land; and on the east by the Cole Valley neighborhood.\n\nRotary Meadow, a garden of California native plants, is at the summit within the Mount Sutro Open Space Reserve. It was funded by a $100,000 grant from the Rotary Club and its members in 2004. The garden is maintained by the Sutro Stewards volunteers, and has water supplied by UCSF. It is accessible by paved road from Clarendon Avenue through UCSF's Aldea San Miguel housing complex. Most of the garden's plants reach peak bloom in the spring. It is encircled by the Eucalyptus forest, and therefore has no views of the city, as the nearby non-forested Twin Peaks and Tank Hill do.\n\nThe hill and forest are accessible by hiking trails, many of which are suitable for mountain bikes. Sutro Stewards.org: Map of Mount Sutro Another access to the summit is from 7th Avenue on the west side of the mountain, climbing the 355-step public stairway from Warren Drive to Crestmont Drive (named Oakhurst Way on many maps), then turning left/north and entering the forest where Crestmont makes a sharp right/east turn.\n\nIn 2009, UCSF applied for a grant from FEMA to remove a majority of the eucalyptus trees on 23% of its land, for campus and residential neighborhood fire safety. It was supported by native habitat restoration advocates, for the return and expansion of indigenous habitats that support native flora and fauna within the City.\n\nSome local residents opposed the plan, so in February 2010, UCSF announced it was withdrawing its application to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and would instead conduct a full Environmental Impact Review (EIR) under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) before proceeding with plans to restore the original ecology of Mount Sutro. After over four years, the first step, a preliminary Draft EIR for public review and comments, has yet to be completed by UCSF.\n\nMuch of 19th century Mount Sutro was within the Rancho San Miguel of Alta California, a Mexican land grant given to Jose de Jesus Noe in 1846.\n\nThe ranch property was acquired by Adolph Sutro in 1879, shortly after his Comstock Lode stock was bought out by his partners, the \"Silver Big 4.\" That enabled Sutro to invest in San Francisco real estate on a very large scale, at one point owning almost 10% of San Francisco's total acreage. Sutro used annual Arbor Day celebrations to plant trees (eventually thousands of them) on the rocky coastal sage and chaparral clad slopes and hollows and in sand dunes on his properties.\n\nSutro originally planned to develop residential neighborhoods on the hill, then named \"Mount Parnassus,\" and on another to the east he named \"Mount Olympus.\" The hill was later renamed Mount Sutro, in honor of Sutro who also was the 24th mayor of San Francisco, from 1894 to 1896.\n\nIn July 1895, Sutro donated a site on the \"Parnassus bench\" overlooking Golden Gate Park, to serve as a campus site for the Affiliated Colleges of the University of California, the present day University of California, San Francisco Parnassus Campus. Adolph Sutro died land rich but cash poor in 1898, resulting in the settlement of his estate being long and arduous. Some plans of the Sutro Development Company were completed, including a street railway on Parnassus Boulevard that operated to serve those developments, while many others were stopped by litigation.\n\nWith the settlement of Sutro's estate, after almost twenty years of litigation, much of the developable, eucalyptus-covered land began to be cleared around 1930, and continued through the 1960s. The city expanded westward, and the land was developed for commercial and residential needs.\n\nThough planned as a recreational forest, some areas were logged by Sutro's heirs. In 1934, after a fire, this effort was discontinued. The forest was logged again during World War II, for use as a domestic fuel due to war rationing.\n\nMount Sutro itself, and most of its remaining forest, was within the parcel purchased by the University of California in 1952.\n\n\n"}

Jonas' projects and experiments provided the foundation on which much video performance art would be based. Her influences also extended to conceptual art, theatre, performance art and other visual media. She lives and works in New York and Nova Scotia, Canada.\n\nJonas was born in 1936 in New York City., Electronic Arts Intermix, Retrieved August 13, 2014.</ref> In 1958 she received a bachelor's degree in Art History from Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts. She later studied sculpture and drawing at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and received an MFA in Sculpture from Columbia University in 1965. Immersed in New York's downtown art scene of the 1960s, Jonas studied with the choreographer Trisha Brown for two years.\nJonas also worked with choreographers Yvonne Rainer and Steve Paxton.\n\nThough Jonas began her career as a sculptor, by 1968 she moved into what was then leading-edge territory: mixing performance with props and mediated images, situated outdoors in urban or rural landscapes and/or industrial environments. Between 1968-1971, Jonas performed \"Mirror Pieces\", works which used mirrors to as a central motif or prop. In these early performances, the mirror became a symbol of (self-)portraiture, representation, the body, and real vs. imaginary, while also sometimes adding an element of danger and a connection to the audience that was integral to the work. In \"Wind\" (1968), Jonas filmed performers stiffly passing through the field of view against a wind that lent the choreography a psychological mystique.\n\nIn 1970, Jonas went on a long trip to Japan — where she bought her first video camera and saw Noh, Bunraku and Kabuki theater — with the sculptor Richard Serra. Her video performances between 1972 and 1976 pared the cast down to one actor, the artist herself, performing in her New York loft as \"Organic Honey\", her seminal alter-ego invented as an \"electronic erotic seductress,\" whose doll-like visage seen reflected bits on camera explored the fragmented female image and women’s shifting roles. drawings, costumes, masks, and interactions with the recorded image were effects that optically related to a doubling of perception and meaning. In one such work, \"Organic Honey's Visual Telepathy\" (1972), Jonas scans her own fragmented image onto a video screen. In \"Disturbances\" (1973), a woman swims silently beneath another woman's reflection. \"Songdelay\" (1973), filmed with both telephoto and wide-angle lenses (which produce opposing extremes in depth of field) drew on Jonas' travels in Japan, where she saw groups of Noh performers clapping wood blocks and making angular movements. In a video interview for MoMA, Jonas described her work as androgynous; earlier works were more involved in the search for a feminine vernacular in art, she explains, and, unlike sculpture and painting, video was more open, less dominated by men.\n\nIn 1975, Jonas appeared as a performer in the movie \"Keep Busy\", by the photographer Robert Frank and novelist-screenwriter Rudy Wurlitzer.\nIn 1976 with \"The Juniper Tree\", Jonas arrived at a narrative structure from diverse literary sources, such as fairy tales, mythology, poetry, and folk songs, formalizing a highly complex, nonlinear method of presentation. Using a colorful theatrical set and recorded sound, \"The Juniper Tree\" retold a Grimm Brothers tale of an archetypal evil stepmother and her family.\n\nIn the 1990s, Jonas’ \"My New Theater\" series moved away from a dependence on her physical presence. The three pieces investigated, in sequence: a Cape Breton dancer and his local culture; a dog jumping through a hoop while Jonas draws a landscape; and finally, using stones, costumes, memory-laden objects, and her dog, a video about the act of performing. She also created 'Revolted by the Thought of Known Places…\" (1992) and \"Woman in the Well\" (1996/2000).\n\nIn her installation/performance commissioned for \"Documenta 11\", \"Lines in the Sand\" (2002), Jonas investigated themes of the self and the body in a performance installation based on the writer H.D.’s (Hilda Doolittle) epic poem \"Helen in Egypt\" (1951–55), which reworks the myth of Helen of Troy. Jonas sited many of her early performances at The Kitchen, including \"Funnel\" (1972) and the screening of \"Vertical Roll\" (1972). In \"The Shape, The Scent, The Feel of Things\", produced by The Renaissance Society in 2004, Jonas draws on Aby Warburg's work on Hopi imagery.\n\nSince 1970, Jonas has spent part of every summer in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. She has lived and worked in Greece, Morocco, India, Germany, \nthe Netherlands, Iceland, Poland, Hungary, and Ireland.\n\nJonas’ works were first performed in the 1960s and '70s for some of the most influential artists of her generation, including Richard Serra, Robert Smithson, Dan Graham and Laurie Anderson. While she is widely known in Europe, her groundbreaking performances are lesser known in the United States, where, as critic Douglas Crimp wrote of her work in 1983, \"the rupture that is effected in modernist practices has subsequently been repressed, smoothed over.\" Yet, in restaging early and recent works, Jonas continues to find new layers of meanings in themes and questions of gender and identity that have fueled her art for over thirty years.\n\nJonas' performance inspired by the writings of German anthropologist Aby Warburg, \"The Shape, The Scent, The Feel of Things,\" was commissioned by Dia Beacon and was twice performed between 2005 and 2006. This project established an ongoing and continuing collaboration with the pianist Jason Moran.\n\nFor the season 2014/2015 in the Vienna State Opera Joan Jonas designed a large-scale picture (176 sqm) as part of the exhibition series \"Safety Curtain\", conceived by museum in progress.\n\nJonas' was also featured as a choreographer for Robert Ashley's Opera titled Celestial Excursions in 2003\n\nFrom 1993, the New York-based Jonas spent part of each year in Los Angeles, teaching a course in New Genres at the UCLA School of the Arts. In 1994, she was made a full professor at the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart, Germany. Since 1998, she has been a professor of visual arts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where she is currently Professor Emerita in Art, Culture, and Technology within the School of Architecture and Planning.\n\nJonas has performed her works at countless institutions and venues, including:\n\n\nJonas has had a number of solo exhibitions, including:\n\n\nJonas has participated in many international group exhibitions, including:\n\n\nIn 2009, she exhibited for the first (and only other) time at the Venice Biennale.\n\nIn 2015, Jonas represented the United States of America at the Venice Biennale.

He is a graduate of Port Tampa's Robinson High School. He is best known for his appearances in multiple National Wrestling Alliance territories as one-half of the tag team The Fabulous Ones, as well as his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation under the ring name Skinner.\n\nMuch of Keirn's early career was spent wrestling as part of a tag team. While wrestling in Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF), he held the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship twelve times; once each with Bob Backlund, Jimmy Garvin, and Brian Blair, and nine times with Mike Graham. In addition, the team of Keirn and Graham won the NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship three times.\n\nIn 1980 and 1981, Keirn focused on his career as a singles wrestler. He won many titles in Florida and Georgia, including the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Title by defeating Chavo Guerrero Sr.. This title reign was recognized by New Japan Pro Wrestling, as well as the Los Angeles and Florida NWA territories, but not by the NWA as a whole, which considered the title vacant and held a tournament to crown a new champion. The title Keirn held was later renamed the NWA International Junior Heavyweight Title. Keirn also won the NWA National Television Championship twice, defeating Terry Funk and Kevin Sullivan.\n\nIn 1981, Keirn began wrestling with the Tennessee-based Continental Wrestling Association (CWA). He was successful as a singles wrestler, winning a tournament to claim the AWA Southern Heavyweight Championship. He also held the NWA Mid-America Heavyweight Championship on two occasions. As in CWF, Keirn found his greatest success in the tag team division. He held the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship 17 times, including 14 reigns as one half of the Fabulous Ones with Stan Lane. Keirn and Lane also teamed to win the CWA World Tag Team Championship twice.\n\nThe Fabulous Ones competed in various promotions over the next decade. In 1984, the team won the Southwest Championship Wrestling World Tag Team Championship while wrestling in Australia. In the United States, they won the NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship twice. In 1991, the pair wrestled in the United States Wrestling Association, defeating Tony Anthony and Doug Gilbert to win the USWA Tag Team Championship.\n\nIn the summer of 1991, Keirn debuted in the WWF as Skinner, an alligator hunter from the Florida Everglades. He was portrayed as a generally nasty individual, always chewing on tobacco and sometimes spitting it on his opponent. He carried an alligator claw to the ring with him, which he would often use as a weapon against his opponents. He competed in the 1991 King of the Ring tournament, defeating Virgil in the first round but losing to Bret Hart in the second round. While still being billed as undefeated, he challenged Hart for the WWF Intercontinental Championship at This Tuesday in Texas on December 3, 1991 but lost by submission. Skinner competed in the 1992 Royal Rumble, lasting 2:13 before being eliminated by Rick Martel. At WrestleMania VIII, he was defeated in one minute and eleven seconds by Owen Hart.\n\nKeirn competed in the 1993 Royal Rumble but was eliminated by Mr. Perfect at the 3:05 mark. While in the WWF, Keirn also portrayed Doink the Clown on occasion. At WrestleMania IX, Keirn helped the original Doink defeat Crush by attacking Crush dressed as Doink during the match. Keirn left the WWF in April 1993.\n\nAlong with Bobby Eaton, Keirn wrestled in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1994 in a tag team known as \"Bad Attitude\". Despite the tag team success both Keirn and Eaton enjoyed in the past (with The Fabulous Ones and the Midnight Express respectively), the team made little impact, losing dark matches to Brian and Brad Armstrong at Bash at the Beach 1994 and Fall Brawl 1994. While in WCW, Keirn was also involved in an angle in which masked men attacked Hulk Hogan. Several times in October 1994, Keirn wore a black mask to attack Hogan during and after Hogan's matches.\n\nSince the late 1980s, Keirn has run a school to train wrestlers. Originally located in Tampa, Florida, Keirn's \"Professional Wrestling School of Hard Knocks\" is now located in Brandon, Florida. \nKeirn helped train many wrestlers, including Mike Awesome, Dennis Knight, Joe \"Destiny\" Clapp, Diamond Dallas Page, Dustin Rhodes and Tracy Smothers.\nThe school was incorporated into the WWE's developmental territory, Florida Championship Wrestling, which opened on June 26, 2007, and Keirn was named President of the FCW and made regular appearances on FCW television. His last match was on December 10, 2007 at the 15th Anniversary Raw participating in a Battle Royal where he was eliminated from the match by Sgt. Slaughter. On August 14, 2012, FCW was discontinued and the WWE Performance Center opened on July 11, 2013.\n\n\n\n"}

Through his sophomore (2nd) year he boarded at his uncle's house and for the later years of his Yale College course he supported himself by teaching in New Haven, CT.\n\nAfter graduation he began the study of law in Windsor, under the direction of Oliver Ellsworth, and at the same time taught an academy. After about two years he removed to the Litchfield Law School, where he continued his studies with Tapping Reeve, while teaching a common school.\n\nIn February, 1795, he was elected a tutor at Yale College, and on March 12 began his duties succeeding James Gould, of the Class of 1791, in the instruction of the sophomore \"(2nd year)\" class, and at the same time continuing the study of law with the Roger Sherman's son-in-law, Simeon Baldwin (Yale 1781). He united with the church in Yale College by profession of his faith on May 1, 1796, and ever after made the advancement of the interests of religion a prime object.\n\nHe was admitted to the bar in New Haven early in 1796, and in May of that year resigned his tutorship and settled in the profession of the law in Norwalk, Connecticut.\n\nOn December 13, 1796, he married Elizabeth (or Betsy) \"(the daughter of Dr. and Colonel William Gould)\", but at that time of New Haven, and sister of Dr. Orchard Gould (Yale 1783) and of Judge James Gould (Yale 1791) of the Litchfield Law School.\n\nHis eminence in his profession was early acknowledged, and his influence exerted in other relations. He represented the town in the General Assembly in the two sessions of 1798.\n\nIn 1807, he removed to Fairfield, in the same county, where the principal courts were at that time held, and where he resided until the time of his death.\n\nHe continued at the bar for forty-three (43) years, and his business as an advocate was very extensive.\n\nIt is believed that he argued more causes than any other lawyer who practiced in Connecticut during the first half of the nineteenth century. He did comparatively little office-business, but devoted his time to the trial of causes in court, and he also for more than twenty-five years attended the Legislature as an advocate in cases pending before that body. He was deeply interested in the administration of justice as provided for by legislative enactment, and many of the statutes of the State in the Department of municipal law during his active life were drawn up and their passage procured by him.\n\nIn 1814, he was elected to the Connecticut Governor's Council, and continued in that office until May, 1818, when the constitution of the State was altered. During this time he declined a nomination to the United States Congress. In 1814, he was appointed a delegate to the Hartford Convention, in the proceedings of which he took an active part. He had been actively interested also in the steps preliminary to the call of the Convention, and was the author of the Report to the Connecticut Legislature, of the Committee which had recommended the appointment of delegates.\n\nAfter the death of Yale College President Timothy Dwight in 1817, he was considered by some as a candidate for the presidency of Yale.\n\nIn 1829, the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred on him by the Corporation of Yale College. He was a representative of Fairfield in the General Assembly in 1825 and 1838.\n\nIn May, 1839, he was appointed a Judge of the Superior Court and of the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut, but resigned in May, 1842, on account of ill health. His legal knowledge, his thoroughness and independence, and his inflexible integrity contributed to make his tenure of this office highly successful.\n\nDuring the last years of his life he suffered from acute disease, and consequently lived in retirement, though his intellectual powers remained unimpaired.\n\nIn December, 1844, he was seized with more severe illness, and declined rapidly until his death, in Fairfield, on December 30, in his 72d year. The discourse preached at his funeral by his pastor, the Rev. Lyman Hotchkiss Atwater (Yale 1831), was afterwards published. Judge Sherman had been elected deacon in the church in Fairfield in 1810, but resigned before his death.\n\nHis widow died in Fairfield, after years of feeble health, on August 3, 1848, in her 75th year.\n\nTheir only children were twin sons, both of extraordinary promise, whose health failed early.\n\nMrs. Sherman's will, made in pursuance of her husband's, bequeathed their homestead \"(which was when built first built, the finest home in town)\", with an endowment fund to the First Ecclesiastical Society of Fairfield. Among other public bequests was one of $4,000 to Yale College. The value of the entire estate was over $71,000.\n\nThere is no doubt that Mr. Sherman's rank as a lawyer was among the very first in the country, --to be compared with that of Jeremiah Mason and Daniel Webster.\n\nHe published:\n\n1. Letter to the Honorable Elisha Phelps, Controller of Public Accounts, Hartford, Connecticut dated Fairfield, March 22, 1832. 1 sheet. [Y.C.]\n\nOn the banking system of the state.\n\n2. Letters to the Honorable Levi Woodbury, Secretary of the Treasury of the United States. New York, 1837. 8°, pp. 24. [Y.C.]\n\nAnonymous. Recommending the establishment of a national bank.\n\nHis opinions as Judge are included in the Connecticut Reports \"(vols. 13 and 14)\". He uniformly declined all invitations for the delivery of public addresses.\n\nHis correspondence and other private papers are deposited in the rooms of the County Historical Society in Fairfield.\n\nA copy of his portrait, painted by Jocelyn in 1840, belongs to the College, --the original still hanging in his mansion in Fairfield.\n\nSource: Roger Minott Sherman Papers Biographical Sketch \"(with paraphrasing)\".\n\n"}

Frankfurt which presents a theory of bullshit that defines the concept and analyzes the applications of bullshit in the context of communication. Frankfurt determines that bullshit is speech intended to persuade without regard for truth. The liar cares about the truth and attempts to hide it; the bullshitter doesn't care if what they say is true or false, but rather only cares whether their listener is persuaded.\n\nFrankfurt originally published the essay \"On Bullshit\" in the \"Raritan Quarterly Review\" journal in 1986. Nineteen years later, the essay was published as the book \"On Bullshit\" (2005), which proved popular among lay readers; the book appeared for 27 weeks on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list, and was discussed on the television show \"The Daily Show With Jon Stewart\", as well as in an interview with a representative of the publisher, Princeton University Press. \"On Bullshit\" (2005) served as the basis for Professor Frankfurt's follow-up book \"On Truth\" (2006).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2270693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270693", "title": "Holger Pedersen (linguist)", "text": "Holger Pedersen (linguist)\n\nHolger Pedersen (; 7 April 1867 – 25 October 1953) was a Danish linguist who made significant contributions to language science and wrote about 30 authoritative works concerning several languages.\n\nHe was born in Gelballe, Denmark, and died in Hellerup, next to Copenhagen.\n\n\"(Principal source: Koerner 1983)\"\n\nPedersen studied at the University of Copenhagen with Karl Verner, Vilhelm Thomsen, and Hermann Möller. He subsequently studied at the University of Leipzig with Karl Brugmann, Eduard Sievers, Ernst Windisch, and August Leskien.\n\nIn the fall of 1893, Pedersen enrolled at the University of Berlin, where he studied with Johannes Schmidt. The following year he studied Celtic languages and Sanskrit with Heinrich Zimmer at the University of Greifswald.\n\nIn 1895 he spent several months in the Aran Islands in Ireland to study the conservative form of Gaelic spoken there.\n\nPedersen submitted his doctoral dissertation to the University of Copenhagen in 1896. It dealt with aspiration in Irish. It was accepted and published in 1897. The dissertation committee included Vilhelm Thomsen and Otto Jespersen.\n\nAlso in 1897, Pedersen took a position as a lecturer on Celtic languages at the University of Copenhagen. In 1900 he became a reader in comparative grammar there. In 1902 he was offered a professorship at the University of Basel, which he declined, but was able at the same time to persuade the University of Copenhagen to establish an extraordinary professorship for him (Koerner 1983:xii). Pedersen also turned down the offer in 1908 of a professorship at the University of Strassburg (ib.). Following the retirement of Vilhelm Thomsen in 1912, Pedersen acceded to Thomsen's chair at the University of Copenhagen. He remained at the University of Copenhagen for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1893, Pedersen traveled to Corfu with Karl Brugmann to study Albanian in place. Subsequently, Pedersen published a volume of Albanian texts collected on this journey (1895). The publication was due to the recommendation of Brugmann and Leskien (Koerner 1983:x). He continued to publish work on Albanian for many years thereafter. Pedersen's work on Albanian is often cited in Vladimir Orel's \"Albanian Etymological Dictionary\" (1995).\n\nAmong students of the Celtic languages Pedersen is best known for his \"Vergleichende Grammatik der keltischen Sprachen\", 'Comparative Grammar of the Celtic Languages', which is still regarded as the principal reference work in Celtic historical linguistics.\n\nHis \"Hittitisch und die anderen indoeuropäischen Sprachen\", 'Hittite and the Other Indo-European Languages', represented a significant step forward in Hittite studies, and is often relied on in Friedrich's \"Hethitisches Elementarbuch\" (2d ed. 1960), the standard handbook of Hittite.\n\nAlso influential was his \"Tocharisch vom Gesichtspunkt der indoeuropäischen Sprachvergleichung\", 'Tocharian from the Viewpoint of Indo-European Language Comparison'. For example, André Martinet (2005:179n) states that his discussion of sound changes in Tocharian is \"\"fondé sur la présentation du tokharien par Holger Pedersen\",\" 'based on the presentation of Tocharian by Holger Pedersen'.\n\nIt was Pedersen who formulated the ruki law, an important sound change in Indo-Iranian, Baltic, and Slavic.\n\nHe is also known for the description of Pedersen's Law, a type of accentual shift occurring in Baltic and Slavic languages (1933a).\n\nPedersen endorsed the laryngeal theory (1893:292) at a time when it \"was regarded as an eccentric fancy of outsiders\" (Szemerényi 1996:123). In his classic exposition of the theory, Émile Benveniste (1935:148) credits Pedersen as one of those who contributed most to its development, along with Ferdinand de Saussure, Hermann Möller, and Albert Cuny.\n\nTwo of Pedersen's theories have been receiving considerable attention in recent times after decades of neglect, often known today under the names of the glottalic theory and the Nostratic theory.\n\nIn a work published in 1951, Pedersen pointed out that the frequency of \"b\" in Indo-European is abnormally low. Comparison of languages, however, shows that it would be normal if it had once been the equivalent voiceless stop \"p\", which is infrequent or absent in many languages.\n\nHe also posited that the Indo-European voiced aspirates, \"bh dh gh\", could be better understood as voiceless aspirates, \"ph th kh\".\n\nPedersen therefore proposed that the three stop series of Indo-European, \"p t k\", \"bh dh gh\", and \"b d g\", had at an earlier time been \"b d g\", \"ph th kh\", and \"(p) t k\", with the voiceless and voiced non-aspirates reversed.\n\nThis theory attracted relatively little attention until the American linguist Paul Hopper (1973) and the two Soviet scholars Tamaz V. Gamkrelidze and Vyacheslav V. Ivanov proposed, in a series of articles culminating in a major work by Gamkrelidze and Ivanov published in 1984 (English translation 1995), that the Indo-European \"b d g\" series had originally been a glottalized series, \"p' t' k'.\" Under this form, the theory has attracted wide interest. There seems to be a good chance that it will endure in one form or another.\n\nPedersen seems to have first used the term \"Nostratic\" in an article on Turkish phonology published in 1903. The kernel of Pedersen's argument for Nostratic in that article was as follows (1903:560-561; \"Indo-Germanic\" = Indo-European):\n\nPedersen’s last sentence should be understood as referring to the article he was writing, not the rest of his career. Although he defined the Nostratic family, he himself never produced the work of synthesis the concept seemed to call for. That would await the work of the Russian scholars Illich-Svitych and Dolgopolsky in the 1960s for its first iteration. Nevertheless, Pedersen did not abandon the subject. He produced a substantial (if overlooked) article on Indo-European and Semitic in 1908. He produced a detailed argument in favor of the kinship of Indo-European and Uralic in 1933. In effect, the three pillars of the Nostratic hypothesis are Indo-Uralic, Ural–Altaic, and Indo-Semitic. Pedersen produced works on two of these three, so the impression is incorrect that he neglected this subject in his subsequent career. His interest in the Nostratic idea remained constant amid his many other activities as a linguist.\n\nEnglish \"Nostratic\" is the normal equivalent of German \"nostratisch\", the form used by Pedersen in 1903, and Danish \"nostratisk\" (compare French \"nostratique\"). His 1931 American translator rendered \"nostratisk\" by \"Nostratian,\" but this form did not catch on.\n\nIn his 1931 book, Pedersen defined Nostratic as follows (1931:338):\n\nIn his view, Indo-European was most clearly related to Uralic, with \"similar, though fainter, resemblances\" to Turkish, Mongolian, and Manchu; to Yukaghir; and to Eskimo (1931:338). He also considered Indo-European might be related to Semitic and that, if so, it must be related to Hamitic and possibly to Basque (ib.).\n\nIn modern terms, we would say he was positing genetic relationship between Indo-European and the Uralic, Altaic, Yukaghir, Eskimo, and Afro-Asiatic language families. (The existence of the Altaic family is controversial, and few would now assign Basque to Afro-Asiatic.)\n\nHowever, in Pedersen's view the languages listed did not exhaust the possibilities for Nostratic (ib.):\n\n1893. \"Das Präsensinfix \"n\",\" in \"Indogermanische Forschungen\" 2, 285-332.\n\n1895. \"Albanische Texte mit Glossar.\" Leipzig: S.

The population of Lauderdale is approximately 2,388 (2006 census). It is in the local government area of City of Clarence. The town is situated on the eastern side of a thin isthmus that connects the South Arm Peninsula to the mainland. It faces Ralphs Bay, and the majority of Lauderdale's population live along Roches Beach, which faces Frederick Henry Bay.\nAlong with nearby Seven Mile Beach, it is a popular residential area for people working in the Hobart CBD.\n\nLauderdale/Roches Beach is overlooked by Single Hill, which is just to the North. Beyond Single Hill is the town of Seven Mile Beach. The view from Single Hill gives a clear view of the town of Lauderdale. The view also shows the nearby ABC radio transmitter mast. The Ralphs Bay side of Lauderdale reveals a sharp gradient in the bay where the water changes colour. This change can be especially noticeable when driving along the main road from Hobart.\n\nWalker Corporation had plans to build a large residential 'canal estate' in Ralphs Bay in front of Lauderdale. There were many protests against the development on ecological grounds; the development would be over sensitive mud flats and affect the habitat of migratory birds and the endangered spotted handfish. Former State Premier Paul Lennon was very much in favour of the development whilst acting as premier. He has close relations with Walker Corp. In June 2010, Ralphs Bay was saved when the Tasmanian Planning Commission rejected the proposed 'Lauderdale Quay' canal housing development. However the Legislative Council of the Tasmanian Parliament debated the Canal Estates (Prohibition) Bill 2011 on July 7, 2012 and voted against this legislation. So while the Ralphs Bay development will not go ahead the way is still open to other developments.\n\n\nLauderdale has a primary school and childcare centre, along with a Christian church (Abundant Life Church).\n\n\nOn 10 March 1946 a Douglas DC-3 aircraft operated by Australian National Airways departed from Cambridge Aerodrome with a crew of 4 and 21 passengers for Essendon Airport. Less than 2 minutes after take-off the aircraft crashed at Seven Mile Beach, killing all on board. At the time it was Australia's worst civil aviation accident.\n"}
{"id": "2270698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270698", "title": "Shrek 4-D", "text": "Shrek 4-D\n\nShrek 4-D (also known as Shrek 3-D for the DVD release and The Ghost of Lord Farquaad for the Netflix and streaming release) is a 4D simulator ride attraction with motion-based effects and water sprayers located at various theme parks around the world. It is currently shown at Universal Parks & Resorts in Florida, Japan, Singapore, and previously in Hollywood, where it closed on August 13, 2017 to make way for the DreamWorks Theatre attraction. Outside the Universal parks, the movie was shown at Movie Park Germany in Germany from May 2008 until July 2011, and Warner Bros. Movie World in Australia from September 2005 until August 2010. A spin-off attraction titled \"Donkey's Photo Finish\" is located at the Florida venue while \"Meet Shrek and Donkey\" is located at the Hollywood venue. In Universal Studios Japan, the attraction is shown in the same theater as Sesame Street 4-D Movie Magic, with the Shrek 4-D film shown for the first half of the day, and the Sesame Street film shown for the second half of the day.\n\nThe ride is a prequel to Shrek 2 and is set right after the events of Shrek.\n\n\nUniversal Parks & Resorts have implemented the movie into four of their amusement parks with plans to integrate it into a fifth. The first park to show the film was Universal Studios Hollywood on May 23, 2003. This was followed by Universal Studios Florida and Japan in June. In 2010, the attraction opened with Universal Studios Singapore in the Shrek-themed Far Far Away themed area. Outside the Universal Parks, the film has only been shown at two theme parks. Movie Park Germany began showing the film on May 27, 2008 (which was shown in German), with Warner Bros. Movie World starting on September 17, 2005.\n\nWarner Bros. Movie World was the first to close Shrek 4D Adventure. An announcement at the start of August 2010 detailed that the attraction would be closing at the end of the month. The final showing was on August 29, 2010. Movie Park Germany was the second to close Shrek 4-D with the final showing on July 4, 2011 and was replaced by Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs - The 4-D Experience, which opened on March 31, 2012. Universal Studios Hollywood was the third to close Shrek 4-D with the final showing on August 13, 2017 to make way for the DreamWorks Theatre.\n\nUniversal Studios Hollywood's Shrek 4-D queue has been used for many years to make mazes for Universal's Halloween Horror Nights event. In 2006, \"The Asylum\" operated in the queue. This was followed by \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" themed mazes for 2007, 2008, and 2010. In 2009 \"My Bloody Valentine: Be Mine 4 Ever\" operated in the queue. The final mazes used in this venue were both themed to La Llorona in 2011 and 2012.\n\nThe attraction was released on DVD with the original \"Shrek\" film as \"Shrek 3-D\" with both 3-D and 2-D versions included. The release included pairs of two-color 3-D glasses. The DVD included an anaglyph 3-D version along with a conventional version without 3-D effects. The DVD release also included a preview of \"Shrek 2\".\n\nOn May 13, 2007, the film was shown on Nickelodeon as \"Shrek's Never Before Seen Adventure\", with the 3-D effects removed.\n\nIn October 2011, the film was released on Netflix under the title \"The Ghost of Lord Farquaad\" as a part of \"DreamWorks Spooky Stories.\"\n\nA comic adaptation of the film was featured as issue #1 of the \"Shrek\" comic book mini-series published by Dark Horse Comics.\n\nAlso the 3D re-release short film shown before the 3D family films in 2011–2012 such as \"Kung Fu Panda 2\", \"Puss in Boots\", and \"\" in the UK.\n\nIt was also released on August 28, 2012, as part of \"Shrek's Thrilling Tales\".\n\nIn the Universal Studios parks, guests wait outside the building (housed in a soundstage) where they watch various clips from the first \"Shrek\" film running on a loop. The queue also includes multiple posters for fake advertisements for attractions in the Kingdom of Duloc. Guests then enter a dungeon in Duloc where the storyline for the attraction will be revealed.\n\nAt Warner Bros. Movie World, the queue began outside the \"Roxy Theatre\" and wrapped around the left-hand side of the building into the alleyway. Guests were ushered into the pre-show room where they were given a pair of 3D glasses. A similar set-up occurred at Movie Park Germany.\n\nParticipants are given their \"OgreVision\" 3-D Goggles as they enter a dungeon-like room with two giant television screens on either side. While loading the pre-show room attraction presenters commonly make jokes to encourage people to move closer to each other in order to fit the capacity audience in the room. The pre-show begins with the Three Little Pigs, Gingy, and Pinocchio revealing that Lord Farquaad has kidnapped them and is holding them in Castle Duloc's dungeon. Gingy flees in the middle of the explanation. The Magic Mirror begins to summarize the story of what happened before (i.e. the first Shrek film) by stating \"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...\" as a spoof on \"Star Wars\". When he is chastised, he quickly responds, \"Sorry...I've been feeling really spaced out lately...\". After the Mirror finishes, Farquaad appears and states that he intends to torture the fairytale creatures as well as the audience in order to find Shrek and Fiona. The monitor screen later shows a test card with Lord Farquaad in the center. The Mirror then warns the audience about safety. In the Hollywood version, Donkey appeared in audio animatronic form and interacted with the guests. With the addition of Donkey, the pre show was shorter in which it did not feature the recap of the story. Everything else was the same. In the Japan version, the Mirror tells the audience to put on their goggles. The cinema doors are then opened and guests take their seats in the theatre.\n\nThe short film takes place right after the first Shrek film. It opens with the spirit of Lord Farquaad returning from the dead to kidnap Princess Fiona. Therefore, it is up to Shrek and Donkey to rescue her. Upon Shrek and Donkey searching around the local graveyard, Farquaad sends a stone statue of Dragon from his tomb to go after them and kill them. Fortunately, the real Dragon arrives to the rescue, leading to a chase scene (featuring the sound of a TIE fighter's blaster from \"Star Wars\" when Dragon shoots a fireball to create a tunnel in a cliff face), ending with the stone dragon losing its wings against the walls of a hole and falling into the water below. Lord Farquaad sends Fiona on a raft to fall over the waterfall (with Thelonious still on it, not realizing he was supposed to get off). Fiona manages to break the restraints and knees Thelonious in the groin, causing him to fall off the raft. Shrek and Donkey arrive shortly after to rescue her before the raft plunges over the waterfall, but in the end, all four of them fall over the waterfall, only to be saved by Dragon, who then (under Donkey's orders) breathes fire at Farquaad, destroying him again.\n\nAlthough the animation is 3D, the ride is a 4D film, which incorporates physical effects including motion seats which tilt forward, backward, vibrate, and raise up and drop down during the show. Water sprayers are attached to the back of each seat, to spray the face of the rider sitting behind it. Water sprayers on the ceiling spray riders seated on the front row. Multiple lighting effects are used, such as projected images of a moving waterfall on the walls, or \"magical\" sparkles of flickering light. Air blasters on the front of every seat blow air against riders neck and head. Leg ticklers are also used to simulate spiders crawling across the theater. Stationary seats, which do not move during the film, are marked and available for those who want to watch the film without the motion or vibration. Every other effect is available for the stationary seats.\n\nA number of spin-off attractions operate alongside Shrek 4-D in various amusement parks.\n\nIn Universal Studios Florida, \"Donkey's Photo Finish\" is a meet and greet attraction that opened in 2003 alongside the film, replacing \"Stage 54\". The attraction consists of guests walking up to an animatronic Donkey who mingles with them and makes fun of them. The guests have their picture taken with Donkey, and then move onto meeting Shrek and Princess Fiona, the latter of which talks to them. Guests then have their picture taken with Shrek and Fiona. These photos can then be purchased. The attraction temporarily closed in June 2012 to make way for \"\", before reopening in a new location next to Monsters Cafe. A similar attraction is located at Universal Studios Hollywood named \"Meet Shrek and Donkey\".\n\nIn Universal Studios Singapore, Shrek 4-D exists within the larger Far Far Away themed area. Other attractions in the area include \"Donkey Live\" (an interactive live show using digital puppetry technology, which features Donkey entertaining and engaging guests in conversation in an intimate theater setting), Enchanted Airways (a junior roller coaster that features trains modelled after Dragon), Puss in Boots' Giant Journey (a roller coaster with suspended ride vehiclesa, featuring Puss in Boots as he runs from a giant goose) and \"Magic Potion Spin\" (a miniature ferris wheel for children which is themed to be a part of a potion assembly line).\n\nDuring the attraction's time at Warner Bros. Movie World, a short-lived live show named \"Shrek Live\" was shown in the park's Show Stage.\n\n\n"}

The race started in 1895 and is Australia's oldest one day race and the world's second oldest one day race, after the Liège–Bastogne–Liège Classic. Historically until 1938 the race started in Warrnambool and finished later in Melbourne. In 1895 the race was run in the opposite direction, from Melbourne to Warrnambool and then again from 1939. The route started in central Melbourne and followed the Princes Highway to Warrnambool on Victoria's western coast. This traditional route was the longest race on the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) calendar, the exact distance varying slightly over time.\n\nThe race was a handicap event from 1895 to 1995, with riders leaving Melbourne at different intervals. From 1996 the race has been conducted as a Scratch Race with a mass start with up to 250 entrants, categorized into A, B, C, and D grades over a distance of . In 2004 it was changed to . In the towns on route there are now sprint points to be earned for a sprint champion competition. With six climbs during the day, a King of the Mountains championship is also at stake.\n\nWhile the race usually attracts Australia's best locally based road cyclists (the increasing number of Australians racing for European-based professional teams have rarely entered in recent years), the race is also open to amateur club cyclists who race for the prizes in the secondary grades, or just to finish before the designated cutoff time.\n\nIn 2009 the race start was shifted to Werribee, on Melbourne's outer south-western outskirts, and the race distance shortened to . Several additional hills were added to the route near Camperdown. The primary difficulty of the race remains its length and the strong crosswinds which affect the course. There was no race in 2018 as the event moved from its October date in 2017 to be held in February 2019. The course was also changed, starting at Avalon Airport, through Geelong, Winchelsea, Colac and Port Campbell, before finishing in Warrnambool.\n\nIn 1895 Don Charlston conceived the first race after riding from Warrnambool to Melbourne in a personal time trial. The first race was held on 5 October 1895 and won by New Zealander Andrew Calder in 11 hours 44 minutes, with a 2 hours handicap start for the 165-mile trip. He suffered a puncture near Geelong which lost him 20 minutes, but crossed the line with a lead of 31 minutes. The fastest time during this first race was recorded by Jim Carpenter from scratch who took 10 hours 52 minutes and finished in 4th place. Of the 50 riders that entered, 24 started and only 7 finished the race. A second race occurred ten weeks later over the same distance.\n\nFrom 1901 to 1939 the title of Long Distance Road Champion of Australasia was awarded with the Blue Riband to the fastest time over the full distance of .

In 1923 a sprint point was introduced for the first . The first winner was Jack Beasley from Fitzroy in what was claimed as a world record time of 4h 37' 57\". In 1927 the Warrnambool to Melbourne was replaced by the Dunlop Grand Prix, a race over four stages, with the 4th stage being from Warrnambool to Melbourne. In 1934 the Warrnambool to Melbourne was again replaced by a stage race, the Centenary 1000, a 1,102 miles (1,773 km) race over seven stages, with the 1st stage being from Melbourne to Warrnambool. From 1947 to 1949 the title of long distance road champion of Australia was awarded at a sprint point into the race.

{"id": "2270723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270723", "title": "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince", "text": "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a fantasy novel written by British author J.K. Rowling and the sixth and penultimate novel in the \"Harry Potter\" series. Set during Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts, the novel explores the past of Harry's nemesis, Lord Voldemort, and Harry's preparations for the final battle against Voldemort alongside his headmaster and mentor Albus Dumbledore.\n\nThe book was published in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury and in the United States by Scholastic on 16 July 2005, as well as in several other countries. It sold nine million copies in the first 24 hours after its release, a record that was eventually broken by its sequel, \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\". There were many controversies before and after it was published, including the right to read copies delivered before the release date in Canada. Reception to the novel was generally positive, and it won several awards and honours, including the 2006 British Book of the Year award.\n\nReviewers noted that the book took on a darker tone than its predecessors, though it did contain some humour. Some considered the main themes to be love, death, trust, and redemption. The considerable character development of Harry and many other teenage characters also drew attention.\n\nThe film adaptation of \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" was released 15 July 2009 by Warner Bros.\n\nDumbledore picks Harry up from his aunt and uncle's house to escort him to the Burrow, home of Harry's best friend Ron Weasley. They detour to the home of Horace Slughorn, former Potions teacher at Hogwarts, and Harry unwittingly helps persuade Slughorn to teach. Harry and Dumbledore proceed to the Burrow, where Hermione Granger has already arrived.\n\nSeverus Snape, a member of the Order of the Phoenix, meets with Narcissa Malfoy, Draco's mother, and her sister Bellatrix Lestrange, Lord Voldemort's faithful supporter. Narcissa expresses concern that her son might not survive a dangerous mission given to him by Lord Voldemort. Bellatrix believes Snape will not help until he makes an Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa, swearing to assist Draco.\n\nOn the Hogwarts Express, Harry discusses his suspicions of Draco’s allegiance with Voldemort, however Ron and Hermione are dubious. Harry dons his invisibility cloak and hides in the carriage that Malfoy is seated in. He overhears Draco bragging to his friends about the mission Voldemort has assigned him. Malfoy becomes suspicious that someone else is in the carriage and discovers Harry. He petrifies him and breaks his nose. Nymphadora Tonks finds Harry and escorts him to the castle.\n\nDumbledore announces that Snape will be teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts and Slughorn will be Potions master. Harry excels in Potions using a textbook that once belonged to \"The Half-Blood Prince\", who wrote tips and spells in the book. The Half-Blood Prince's tips help Harry win a bottle of Felix Felicis, or \"Liquid Luck\". Though Harry's success pleases Slughorn, his newfound brilliance in potions angers Hermione, who feels he is not earning his grades.\n\nBelieving Harry needs to learn Voldemort's past to gain advantage in a foretold battle, Dumbledore and Harry use Dumbledore's Pensieve to look at the memories of those who had direct contact with Voldemort. Harry learns about Voldemort's family and his foe's evolution into a murderer, obsessed with power and immortality. Dumbledore shows Harry a memory involving Slughorn conversing with the young Tom Riddle at Hogwarts, which has been tampered with. He asks Harry to convince Slughorn to give him the true memory so that Dumbledore can confirm his suspicions about Voldemort. \n\nAfter being invited to a funeral for Aragog the Spider, Harry uses a dose of Felix Felicis and retrieves Slughorn's memory. In it, Slughorn tells Riddle about the process of splitting one's soul and hiding it in Horcruxes. Only by committing a murder can a wizard turn an object into a Horcrux; Voldemort created six of them, making himself virtually immortal, and kept the seventh within his body. To destroy Voldemort, the Horcruxes must first be destroyed. Two Horcruxes, Riddle's diary from \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" and a ring belonging to Voldemort's grandfather, have already been destroyed; four others remain.\n\nRon and Hermione grow closer, but after learning from his sister Ginny that Hermione previously kissed Viktor Krum, Ron goes out with Lavender Brown, making Hermione jealous. After Ron is nearly killed in an attempt on Dumbledore's life, he and Hermione reconcile. Ron and Lavender break up when Lavender sees them walking out of the boys' dormitories together. Harry develops feelings for Ginny, but is reluctant to pursue her because of his friendship with Ron. Following a wild Gryffindor Quidditch victory, Harry and Ginny begin a relationship with Ron's reluctant consent.\n\nNear the end of the year, Harry and Dumbledore journey to a cave to retrieve a suspected Horcrux, Slytherin's locket. Dumbledore finds a passageway to an underground lake, which Harry and Dumbledore cross in a boat to an island. The locket is submerged in a basin, and can only be reached by drinking the potion above it. Dumbledore drinks the potion and experiences hallucinations and pain. Though Dumbledore is severely weakened, the two fight off Voldemort's Inferi, which were hiding in the lake. They take the locket and return to Hogwarts, to find that the Dark Mark has been placed over a school tower. Harry and Dumbledore ascend the tower and are ambushed by Draco, accompanied by Death Eaters that he helped get inside Hogwarts. Dumbledore freezes Harry under his Invisibility Cloak to keep him hidden. Draco disarms Dumbledore and threatens to kill him, which turns out to have been his mission from Voldemort. Draco cannot go through with it. Snape arrives and kills Dumbledore instead. Harry ignores the battle raging in Hogwarts to pursue Dumbledore's killer. Snape fights Harry off and reveals that he is the Half-Blood Prince before he, Draco, and the other Death Eaters escape.\n\nAfter Dumbledore's funeral, Harry breaks up with Ginny, saying it is too dangerous for her to continue their relationship. Harry finds out that the locket is not the real Horcrux, containing only a note from someone named \"R. A. B.\". Harry tells his friends he will not be returning to Hogwarts; he will spend the next year searching out Voldemort's Horcruxes. Ron and Hermione insist on joining him.\n\n\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" is the sixth book in the Harry Potter series. The first book in the series, \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", was first published by Bloomsbury in 1997, with an initial print-run of 500 copies in hardback, 300 of which were distributed to libraries. By the end of 1997, the UK edition won a National Book Award and a gold medal in the 9- to 11-year-olds category of the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize. The second book, \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\", was originally published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and in the US on 2 June 1999. \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" was then published a year later in the UK on 8 July 1999 and in the US on 8 September 1999. \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" was published on 8 July 2000 at the same time by Bloomsbury and Scholastic. \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\", the longest novel in the Harry Potter series, was released 21 June 2003. After the publishing of \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\", the seventh and final novel, \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\", was released 21 July 2007. The book sold 11 million copies within 24 hours of its release: 2.7 million copies in the UK and 8.3 million in the US.\n\nRowling stated that she had \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" \"planned for years,\" but she spent an entire two months going over her plan before she began writing the story seriously. This was a lesson learned after she did not check the plan for \"Goblet of Fire\" and had to rewrite an entire third of the book. She started writing the book before her second child, David, was born, but she took a break to care for him. The first chapter, \"The Other Minister\", which features meetings between the Muggle Prime Minister, Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge, and his successor, Rufus Scrimgeour, was a concept Rowling tried to start in \"Philosopher's Stone\", \"Prisoner of Azkaban\", and \"Order of the Phoenix\", but she found \"it finally works\" in \"Half-Blood Prince\". She stated that she was \"seriously upset\" writing the end of the book, although \"Goblet of Fire\" was the hardest to write. When asked if she liked the book, she responded, \"I like it better than I liked \"Goblet\", \"Phoenix\" or \"Chamber\" when I finished them. Book six does what I wanted it to do and even if nobody else likes it (and some won't), I know it will remain one of my favourites of the series. Ultimately you have to please yourself before you please anyone else!\"\n\nRowling revealed the title of \"Half-Blood Prince\" on her website on 24 June 2004. This was the title she had once considered for the second book, \"Chamber of Secrets\", though she decided the information disclosed belonged later on in the story. On 21 December 2004, she announced she had finished writing it, along with the release date of 16 July. Bloomsbury unveiled the cover on 8 March 2005.\n\nThe record-breaking publication of \"Half-Blood Prince\" was accompanied by controversy. In May 2005, bookmakers in the UK suspended bets on which main character would die in the book amid fears of insider knowledge. A number of high-value bets were made on the death of Albus Dumbledore, many coming from the town of Bungay where it was believed the books were being printed at the time. Betting was later reopened. Additionally, in response to Greenpeace's campaign on using forest friendly paper for big-name authors, Bloomsbury published the book on 30% recycled paper.\n\nIn early July 2005, a Real Canadian Superstore in Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada, accidentally sold fourteen copies of \"The Half-Blood Prince\" before the authorised release date. The Canadian publisher, Raincoast Books, obtained an injunction from the Supreme Court of British Columbia that actually prohibited the purchasers from reading the books before the official release date or discussing the contents. Purchasers were actually offered Harry Potter T-shirts and autographed copies of the book if they returned their copies before 16 July.\n\nOn 15 July, less than twelve hours before the book went on sale in the Eastern time zone, Raincoast warned \"The Globe and Mail\" newspaper that publishing a review from a Canada-based writer at midnight, as the paper had promised, would be seen as a violation of the trade secret injunction. The injunction sparked a number of news articles alleging that the injunction had restricted fundamental rights. Canadian law professor Michael Geist posted commentary on his blog. Richard Stallman called for a boycott and requested the publisher issue an apology. \"The Globe and Mail\" published a review from two UK-based writers in its 16 July edition and posted the Canadian writer's review on its website at 9:00 that morning. Commentary was also provided on the Raincoast website.\n\nSome reviewers noted that \"Half-Blood Prince\" contained a darker tone than the previous \"Potter\" novels. \"The Christian Science Monitor\" reviewer Yvonne Zipp argued the first half contained a lighter tone to soften the unhappy ending. \"The Boston Globe\" reviewer Liz Rosenberg wrote, \"lightness [is] slimmer than ever in this darkening series...[there is] a new charge of gloom and darkness. I felt depressed by the time I was two-thirds of the way through.\" She also compared the setting to Charles Dickens's depictions of London as it was \"brooding, broken, gold-lit, as living a character as any other.\" Christopher Paolini called the darker tone \"disquieting\" because it was so different from the earlier books. Liesl Schillinger, a contributor to \"The New York Times\" book review, also noted that \"Half-Blood Prince\" was \"far darker\" but \"leavened with humor, romance and snappy dialogue.\" She suggested a connection to the 11 September attacks, as the later, darker novels were written after that event. David Kipen, a critic of the \"San Francisco Chronicle,\" considered the \"darkness as a sign of our paranoid times\" and singled out curfews and searches that were part of the tightened security at Hogwarts as resemblances to our world.\n\nJulia Keller, a critic for the \"Chicago Tribune\", highlighted the humour found in the novel and claimed it to be the success of the \"Harry Potter\" saga. She acknowledged that \"the books are dark and scary in places\" but \"no darkness in \"Half-Blood Prince\"...is so immense that it cannot be rescued by a snicker or a smirk.\" She considered that Rowling was suggesting difficult times can be worked through with imagination, hope, and humour and compared this concept to works such as Madeleine L'Engle's \"A Wrinkle in Time\" and Kenneth Grahame's \"The Wind in the Willows\".\n\nRosenberg wrote that the two main themes of \"Half-Blood Prince\" were love and death and praised Rowling's \"affirmation of their central position in human lives.\" She considered love to be represented in several forms: the love of parent to child, teacher to student, and the romances that developed between the main characters. Zipp noted trust and redemption to be themes promising to continue in the final book, which she thought \"would add a greater layer of nuance and complexity to some characters who could sorely use it.\" Deepti Hajela also pointed out Harry's character development, that he was \"no longer a boy wizard; he's a young man, determined to seek out and face a young man's challenges.\" Paolini had similar views, claiming, \"the children have changed...they act like real teenagers.\"\n\n\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" was met with positive reviews. Liesl Schillinger of \"The New York Times\" praised the novel's various themes and suspenseful ending. However, she considered Rowling's gift \"not so much for language as for characterisation and plotting.\" \"Kirkus Reviews\" said it \"will leave readers pleased, amused, excited, scared, infuriated, delighted, sad, surprised, thoughtful and likely wondering where Voldemort has got to, since he appears only in flashbacks.\" They considered Rowling's \"wry wit\" to turn into \"outright merriment\" but called the climax \"tragic, but not uncomfortably shocking.\" Yvonne Zipp of \"The Christian Science Monitor\" praised the way Rowling evolved Harry into a teenager and how the plot threads found as far back as \"Chamber of Secrets\" came into play. On the other hand, she noted it \"gets a little exposition-heavy in spots,\" and older readers may have seen the ending coming.\n\n\"The Boston Globe\" correspondent Liz Rosenberg wrote, \"The book bears the mark of genius on every page\" and praised the imagery and darker tone of the book, considering that the series could be crossing over from fantasy to horror. The Associated Press writer Deepti Hajela praised the newfound emotional tones and ageing Harry to the point at which \"younger fans may find [the series] has grown up too much.\" Emily Green, a staff writer for the \"Los Angeles Times\", was generally positive about the book but was concerned whether young children could handle the material. Cultural critic Julia Keller of the \"Chicago Tribune\" called it the \"most eloquent and substantial addition to the series thus far\" and considered the key to the success of the \"Potter\" novels to be humour.\n\n\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" won several awards, including the 2006 British Book of the Year Award and the 2006 Royal Mail Award for Scottish Children's Books for ages 8–12 in its native United Kingdom. In the United States, the American Library Association listed it among its 2006 Best Books for Young Adults. It won both the 2005 reader-voted Quill Awards for Best Book of the Year and Best Children's Book. It also won the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Platinum Seal for notable book.\n\nBefore publication, 1.4 million pre-orders were placed for \"Half-Blood Prince\" on Amazon.com, breaking the record held by the previous novel, \"Order of the Phoenix\", with 1.3 million. The initial print run for \"Half-Blood Prince\" was a record-breaking 10.8 million. Within the first 24 hours after release, the book sold 9 million copies worldwide: 2 million in the UK and about 6.9 million in the US, which prompted Scholastic to rush an additional 2.7 million copies into print. Within the first nine weeks of publication, 11 million copies of the US edition were reported to have been sold. The US audiobook, read by Jim Dale, set sales records with 165,000 sold over two days, besting the adaptation of \"Order of the Phoenix\" by twenty percent.\n\n\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" was published simultaneously in the UK, US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Along with the rest of the books in the Harry Potter series, it was eventually translated into 67 languages. However, because of high security surrounding the manuscript, translators did not get to start on translating \"Half-Blood Prince\" until its English release date, and the earliest were not expected to be released until the fall of 2005. In Germany, a group of \"hobby translators\" translated the book via the internet less than two days after release, long before German translator Klaus Fritz could translate and publish the book.\n\nSince its wide hardcover release on 16 July 2005, \"Half-Blood Prince\" was released as a paperback on 23 June 2006 in the UK. Two days later on 25 July, the paperback edition was released in Canada and the US, where it had an initial print run of 2 million copies. To celebrate the release of the American paperback edition, Scholastic held a six-week sweepstakes event in which participants in an online poll were entered to win prizes. Simultaneous to the original hardcover release was the UK adult edition that featured a new cover and was also released as a paperback on 23 June. Also released on 16 July was the Scholastic \"Deluxe Edition,\" which featured reproductions of Mary GrandPré's artwork and had a print run of about 100,000 copies. Bloomsbury later released a paperback \"Special Edition\" on 6 July 2009 and a \"Signature Edition\" paperback on 1 November 2010.\n\nThe film adaptation of the sixth book was originally scheduled to be released on 21 November 2008 but was changed to 15 July 2009. Directed by David Yates, the screenplay was adapted by Steve Kloves and produced by David Heyman and David Barron. The film grossed over $934 million worldwide, which made it the second-highest-grossing film of 2009 worldwide and the fifteenth-highest of all time. Additionally, \"Half-Blood Prince\" gained an Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography.\n\nA video game adaptation of the book was developed by EA Bright Light Studio and published by Electronic Arts in 2009. The game was available on the Microsoft Windows, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, Wii, Xbox 360, and macOS platforms.\n\nThe book was also adapted in the 2011 video game .\n"}
{"id": "2270728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270728", "title": "Theory of decreasing responsibility", "text": "Theory of decreasing responsibility\n\nThe theory of decreasing responsibility is a life insurance philosophy that holds that individual financial responsibilities rise and then decline over the course of a lifetime and that life insurance amounts should reflect those changes. These responsibilities include paying consumer debts, mortgages, funding children's education and income replacement. It is promoted by proponents of term life insurance (as opposed to cash-value insurance).\n\nMany financial responsibilities exist for a fixed time interval. Most mortgages cover a fixed number of years. Most children become independent adults. Further, most adults accumulate financial resources during their working life, whether in the form of home equity, savings, investments and/or pensions. For example, if a term insurance policy ends with retirement, the money used to pay premiums can be redirected to consumption, paying for an annuity, etc.\n\nTypically, permanent (whole life) insurance costs at least five times more than term insurance. Investing the difference in a segregated fund/separate account policy allows the insured to access money in an emergency instead of taking a loan from the policy. Policy loans have high-interest rates and deplete the policy's adjusted cost basis (ACB), thus compromising its tax advantage.\n\n\"Buy term and invest the difference\" implements the theory.\n\nThe cash value built-in to a permanent insurance policy has a limited tax advantage depending on the ACB, while segregated funds registered as TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) or RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) offers a better tax advantage since both are registered government programs. If the cash value of a permanent policy has grown because of good fund management, the policy is likely to exceed the Maximum Tax Actuarial Reserve (MTAR), ending its tax-exemption. MTAR is used to stop the use of insurance as tax avoidance scheme.\n\n\n\nHowever, if this were permanent insurance, this 30-year-old can only access a cash value loan in retirement. This loan reduces both the death benefits and the ACB (the tax-free portion of the cash value). When the ACB is depleted, the insurance loses its tax advantage. i.e., the insurance policy becomes a taxable endowment. This also happens when the policy fails the annual MTAR test.\n\nIn most Insured Retirement Plans, cash value loan is collateralized through a third party lender and annuities as tax-free retirement income. Technically the loan becomes a tax fraud waiting to be discovered absent the intention or means to repay the loan. If the 3rd party lender and the insurance company have the same owner, they exhibit a conflict of interest.\n"}

Both brothers were natives of Haarlem, moved to Paris, but died in Amsterdam. The main source about their lives is from Arnold Houbraken. Some of the information from the 19th century is contradictive.\n\nJacob van Huchtenburg (1644, Haarlem - bur. January 8, 1675, Amsterdam) studied under Nicolaes Pieterszoon Berchem. In 1662 he went to Italy and stayed in Rome until 1667. On his way back to Holland he stayed in Paris for more than a year, where he probably met up with his brother Jan. In 1669 he joined the Haarlem artists' guild. His pictures are probably confounded with those of his brother. He became well-to-do and lived on Prinsengracht. One is in the Brukenthal Museum, Sibiu.\n\nJan van Huchtenburg (bapt. November 20, 1647, Haarlem - bur. July 2, 1733, Amsterdam), was a famous Dutch horse and battle painter, like Esaias van de Velde and Philip Wouwermans. He was first taught by Thomas Wijck. On his way to visit his brother in Rome, he may not have got further than Paris, where he served under Antony Francis van der Meulen in the Manufacture des Gobelins employing him for illustrating, sketching or designing.\n\nIn 1670 he settled at Haarlem, where he married Elisabeth Mommes. It seems he practised and kept a dealers shop in Haarlem or in the Hague. His style had now merged into an imitation of Wouwerman and Van der Meulen, which could not fail to produce pretty pictures of hunts and robber camps, the faculty of painting horses and men in action and varied dress being the chief point of attraction. Huchtenburg assisted Gerrit Berckheyde and painted his people and horses.\n\nLater Huchtenburg ventured on cavalry skirmishes and engagements of regular troops generally, and these were admired by Prince Eugene of Savoy and King William III, who gave the painter sittings, and commissioned him to throw upon canvas the chief incidents of the battles they fought upon the continent of Europe. When he died at Bloemgracht in the Jordaan in 1733, Huchtenburg had done much by his pictures and prints to make Prince Eugene, King William and Marlborough popular. Though clever in depicting a mile or a skirmish of dragoons, he remained second to Philip Wouvermans in accuracy of drawing, and inferior to Van der Meulen in the production of landscapes. But, nevertheless, he was a clever and spirited master, with great facility of hand and considerable natural powers of observation.\n\nThe earliest date on his pictures is 1674, when he executed the Stag-Hunt in the Museum of Berlin, and the Fight with Robbers in the Liechtenstein Museum at Vienna. A Skirmish at Fleurus (1690) in the Brussels gallery seems but the precursor of larger and more powerful works, such as the Siege of Namur (1695) in the Belvedere at Vienna, where William III is seen in the foreground accompanied by Max Emmanuel, the Bavarian elector. Three years before, Huchtenburg had had sittings from Prince Eugene and William III. After 1696 he regularly served as court painter to Prince Eugene, and we have at [a] Galleria Sabauda a series of ten or eleven canvases, all of the same size depicting the various battles of the great hero, commencing with the Battle of Zenta (1697), Battle of Chiari (1701), Battle of Luzzara (1702), Battle of Blenheim (1704), Battle of Cassano (1705), Battle of Turin (1706), Battle of Oudenaarde (1708), Battle of Malplaquet (1709), Battle of Petrovaradin (1716) ending with the Battle of Belgrade (1717). Had the Duke of Marlborough been fond of art he would doubtless have possessed many works of our artist. All that remained in 1911 at Blenheim Palace, however, was a couple of sketches of battles, which were probably sent to Churchill by his great contemporary.\n\nIn 1911, the pictures of Huchtenburg were not very numerous in public galleries. There was one in the National Gallery, London, another at the Louvre. But Copenhagen had four, Dresden six, Gotha two, and Munich had the well-known composition of Tallart taken Prisoner at Blenheim in 1704.\n\n\n"}

Vermont was admitted to the United States as the fourteenth state in 1791 after a brief period of sovereignty following the American Revolutionary War. Vermont experienced rising abolitionist sentiment and subsequently fought on the Union side of the American Civil War.\n\nVermont was covered with shallow seas periodically from the Cambrian to Devonian periods. Most of the sedimentary rocks laid down in these seas were deformed by mountain-building. Fossils, however, are common in the Lake Champlain region. Lower areas of western Vermont were flooded again, as part of the St. Lawrence Valley and Champlain Valley by Lake Vermont whose northern boundary followed the melting glacier at the end of the last ice age, until it reached the ocean. This was replaced by Lake Vermont and the Champlain Sea, when the land had not yet rebounded from the weight of the glaciers which were sometimes thick. Shells of salt-water mollusks, along with the bones of beluga whales, have been found in the Lake Champlain region.\n\nLake Vermont connected to a glacial western lake near what is now the Great Lakes. They allowed western fish to enter the state, which is why Vermont has more native species than any other New England State, 78. About half of these are western in origin.\n\nLittle is known of the pre-Columbian history of Vermont. Between 8500 and 7000 BC, glacial activity created the saltwater Champlain Sea. This event caused lamprey, Atlantic salmon, and rainbow smelt to become landlocked.\n\nNative Americans inhabited and hunted in Vermont. From 7000 to 1000 BC was the Archaic Period. During that era, Native Americans migrated year-round. From 1000 BC to 1600 AD was the Woodland Period, when villages and trade networks were established, and ceramic and bow and arrow technology were developed. The western part of the state became home to a small population of Algonquian-speaking tribes, including the Mohican and Abenaki peoples.\n\nThe Sokoki lived in what is now southern Vermont; the Cowasucks in northeastern Vermont.\n\nBetween 1534 and 1609, the Iroquois Mohawks drove many of the smaller native tribes out of the Champlain Valley, later using the area as a hunting ground and warring with the remaining Abenaki.\n\nFrench explorer Samuel de Champlain claimed the area of what is now Lake Champlain, giving the name, \"Verd Mont\" (Green Mountain) to the region he found, on a 1647 map. Evidence suggests that this name came into use among English settlers, before it morphed to \"Vermont\", ca. 1760.\n\nTo aid and impress his new Abenaki allies, Champlain shot and killed an Iroquois chief with an arquebus, July 29, 1609. While the Iroquois were already enemies with the Abenaki, they formed a permanent enmity with the French with this incident, ultimately costing the French the bulk of their most developed possessions in the New World, including the contested area of most of Vermont, at the conclusion of the French and Indian War in 1763.\n\nFrance claimed Vermont as part of New France, and erected Fort Sainte Anne on Isle La Motte in 1666 as part of their fortification of Lake Champlain. This was the first European settlement in Vermont and the site of the first Roman Catholic mass.\n\nDuring the latter half of the 17th century, non-French settlers began to explore Vermont and its surrounding area. In 1690, a group of Dutch-British settlers from Albany under Captain Jacobus de Warm established the De Warm Stockade at Chimney Point (eight miles west of Addison). This settlement and trading post were directly across the lake from Crown Point, New York (\"Pointe à la Chevelure\").\n\nThere were regular periods of skirmishing between English colonies to the south and the French colony to the north, and the area of Vermont was an unsettled frontier. In 1704, De Rouville passed up the Winooski (Onion) River, to reach the Connecticut, and then down to Deerfield, Massachusetts, which he raided.\n\nWith trapping being unregulated, and their forest habitat degraded, beavers vanished from Vermont in the early 1700s.\n\nDuring Father Rale's War, the first permanent British settlement was established in 1724 with the construction of Fort Dummer in Vermont's far southeast under the command of Lieutenant Timothy Dwight of Connecticut. This fort protected the nearby settlements of Dummerston and Brattleboro in the surrounding area. These settlements were made by people from Massachusetts and Connecticut. The second British settlement at Bennington in the southwest corner of Vermont would not be made until after 37 years of conflict in the region.\n\nIn 1725, 60 armed men entered Vermont with rough maps, with the goal of attacking the Village of St. Francis, but turned back at Crown Point.\n\nIn 1731, the French arrived at Chimney Point, near Addison. Here they constructed a small temporary wooden stockade (Fort de Pieux) until work on Fort St. Frédéric began in 1734. When this fort was completed, Fort de Pieux was abandoned as unneeded.\n\nThere was another period of conflict from 1740 to 1748, the War of the Austrian Succession or King George's War. There were raids at a private defensive work, Bridgeman's Fort, in Vernon, Vermont.\n\nDuring the French and Indian War, 1755–1761, some Vermont settlers joined the colonial militia assisting the British in attacks on the French at Fort Carillon.\n\nRogers' Rangers staged an attack against the Abenaki village of Saint-Francis, Quebec from Lake Champlain in 1759. Separating afterwards, they fled the angered French and Abenakis through northern Vermont back to safety in Lake Champlain and New Hampshire.\n\nFollowing France's loss in the French and Indian War, the 1763 Treaty of Paris gave control of the whole region to the British. Colonial settlement was limited by the British to lands east of the Appalachians, and Vermont was divided nearly in half in a jagged line running from Fort William Henry on Lake George diagonally north-eastward to Lake Memphremagog. Lands north of this line, including the entire Champlain Valley, were reserved for Indians. During this time French families were largely driven out, although scholars of the Vermont Archaeological Society have questioned if a French influence was removed completely, noting some remote farms may have eluded the notice of the British colonists.\n\nThe end of the war brought new settlers to Vermont. The first settler of the grants was Samuel Robinson, who began clearing land in Bennington in 1761.\n\nIn the 28 years from 1763 to 1791, the non-Indian population of Vermont rose from 300 to 85,000.\n\nA fort at Crown Point had been built in 1759, and the Crown Point Military Road stretched across the Green Mountains from Springfield to Chimney Point, making traveling from the neighboring British colonies easier than ever before. Three colonies laid claim to the area. The Province of Massachusetts Bay claimed the land on the basis of the 1629 charter of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The Province of New York claimed Vermont based on land granted to the Duke of York (later King James II & VII) in 1664. The Province of New Hampshire, whose western limits had never been determined, also claimed Vermont, in part based upon a decree of George II in 1740. On March 5, 1740, George II ruled that Massachusetts's northern boundary in this area would be from a point near the Merrimack River due west (its present location). The boundary was surveyed by Richard Hasen in 1741, and Fort Dummer (Brattleboro), was found to be north of the line. Provisions and support for Fort Dummer were ordered by the Colonial Office from New Hampshire in the following years.\n\nNew Hampshire's immensely popular governor, Benning Wentworth, issued a series of 135 land grants between 1749 and 1764 called the New Hampshire Grants. Many of these were in a large valley on the west (or New York side) of the Green Mountains and only about forty miles from Albany. The town was laid out in 1749 and was settled after the war in 1761. The town was named Bennington for Wentworth. The location of the town was well north of the Massachusetts limit set by decree in 1740, and east of the known eastern limit of New York, twenty miles east of the Hudson River. Ultimately, by 1754, Wentworth had granted lands for 15 towns.\n\nOn July 20, 1764, King George III established the boundary between New Hampshire and New York along the west bank of the Connecticut River, north of Massachusetts, and south of 45 degrees north latitude. Under this decree, Albany County, New York, as it then existed, implicitly gained the land presently known as Vermont. Although disputes occasionally broke out later, this line became the boundary between New Hampshire and Vermont, and is the modern boundary. When New York refused to recognize land titles through the New Hampshire Grants (towns created earlier by New Hampshire in present Vermont), dissatisfied colonists organized in opposition, which led to the creation of independent Vermont on January 15, 1777.\n\nNew York took the declaration of 1764 to apply retroactively, and considered the New Hampshire grants invalid. It therefore required land holders to purchase new grants for the same land from New York. New York then created counties in the region, with courthouses, sheriffs, and jails, and began judicial proceedings against those who held land solely by New Hampshire grants.\n\nIn 1767, the Privy Council forbade New York from selling land in Vermont that was in conflict with grants from New Hampshire, reversing the 1764 decision.\n\nIn 1770, Ethan Allen—along with his brothers Ira and Levi, as well as Seth Warner—recruited an informal militia, the Green Mountain Boys, to protect the interests of the original New Hampshire settlers against the new migrants from New York. A significant standoff occurred at the Breakenridge farm in Bennington, when a sheriff from Albany arrived with a posse of 750 men to dispossess Breakenridge. The residents raised a body of about 300 armed men to resist. The Albany sheriff demanded Breakenridge, and was informed, \"If you attempt it, you are a dead man.\" The sheriff returned to Albany.\n\nWhen a New York judge arrived in Westminster with New York settlers in March 1775, violence broke out as angry citizens took over the courthouse and called a sheriff's posse. This resulted in the deaths of Daniel Houghton and William French in the \"Westminster Massacre\".\n\nIn the summer of 1776, the first general convention of freemen of the New Hampshire Grants met in Dorset, Vermont, resolving \"to take suitable measures to declare the New Hampshire Grants a free and independent \"district\".\" On January 15, 1777, representatives of the New Hampshire Grants convened in Westminster and declared their land an independent republic. For the first six months of the republic's existence, the state was called New Connecticut.\n\nOn June 2, a second convention of 72 delegates met at Westminster, known as the \"Westminster Convention\". At this meeting, the delegates adopted the name \"Vermont\" on the suggestion of Dr. Thomas Young of Philadelphia, a supporter of the delegates who wrote a letter advising them on how to achieve statehood. The delegates set the time for a meeting one month later. On July 4, the Constitution of Vermont was drafted during a violent thunderstorm at the Windsor Tavern owned by Elijah West. It was adopted by the delegates on July 8 after four days of debate. This was the first written constitution in North America to provide for the abolition of slavery (for adults), suffrage for men who did not own land, and public schools. (See also History of slavery in Vermont.) The tavern has been preserved as the Old Constitution House, administered as a state historic site. Violations of the abolition of slavery persisted for some time.\n\nThe production of potash in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, resulted in the deforestation of much of Vermont.\n\nThe battles of Bennington and Saratoga are recognized as the turning point in the American Revolutionary War. They were the first major defeat of a British army and convinced France that the American rebels were worthy of military aid. General John Stark, who commanded the rebel forces at the Battle of Bennington, became widely known as the \"Hero of Bennington\". \"Bennington Battle Day\" (August 16, the anniversary of the battle) is a legal holiday in Vermont. Under the portico of the Vermont Statehouse, next to a granite statue of Ethan Allen, there is a brass cannon that was captured at Bennington.\n\nThe Battle of Bennington, fought on August 16, 1777, was a seminal event in the history of the state of Vermont. The nascent republican government, created after years of political turmoil, faced challenges from New York, New Hampshire, Great Britain and the new United States, none of which recognized its sovereignty.\n\nDuring the summer of 1777, the invading British army of General John Burgoyne slashed its way southward through the thick forest, from Quebec to the Hudson River, captured the strategic stronghold of Fort Ticonderoga, and drove the Continental Army into a desperate southward retreat. Raiding parties of British soldiers and native warriors freely attacked, pillaged and burned the frontier communities of the Champlain Valley and threatened all settlements to the south. The Vermont frontier collapsed in the face of the British invasion. The New Hampshire legislature, fearing an invasion from the west, mobilized the state's militia under the command of General John Stark.\n\nGeneral Burgoyne received intelligence that large stores of horses, food and munitions were kept at Bennington, which was the largest community in the land grant area. He dispatched 2,600 men, nearly a third of his army, to seize the colonial storehouse there, unaware that General Stark's New Hampshire troops were then traversing the Green Mountains to join up at Bennington with the Vermont continental regiments commanded by Colonel Seth Warner, together with the local Vermont and western Massachusetts militia. The combined American forces, under Stark's command, attacked the British column at Hoosick, New York, just across the border from Bennington. General Stark reportedly challenged his men to fight to the death, telling them that: \"There are your enemies, the redcoats and the Tories. They are ours, or this night Molly Stark sleeps a widow!\" In a desperate, all-day battle fought in intense summer heat, the army of Yankee farmers defeated the British, killing or capturing 900 men. Burgoyne never recovered from this loss and eventually surrendered at Saratoga on October 17.\n\nIn 1778, David Redding, convicted of being a traitor to the colonies and a spy for the British, was hanged in Bennington.\n\nThe first printing press in the state was established in Dresden in 1779.\n\nThe Republic of Vermont continued to govern itself as a sovereign entity based in the eastern town of Windsor for 14 years. Thomas Chittenden acted as chief magistrate of Vermont from 1778 to 1789 and from 1790 to 1791. In the 1780s Chittenden, the Allen brothers, and other political leaders engaged in negotiations with Frederick Haldimand, the British governor of Quebec over the possibility of Vermont becoming a British province. These negotiations ultimately failed in part due to the timely surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown in 1781.\n\nThe first General Assembly voted to establish two counties, Bennington in the west and Unity in the east. It adopted the common law of England as the basis for its legal system. It voted to confiscate Tory lands and sell them to finance the militia. This was the first \"tax\" passed in the state.\n\nThe first newspaper was published in the state in 1781, the weekly \"Vermont Gazette\".\n\nIn 1784, the state established a postal service linking several towns and Albany, New York.\n\nIn 1786, the Vermont governor replied to requests from Massachusetts about the Shays' Rebellion, saying that he was willing to extradite members of the rebellion, though his response was \"pro forma\" only since the state could ill afford to discourage immigration.\n\nIn 1791, Vermont joined the federal Union as the fourteenth state—becoming the first state to enter the Union after the original thirteen colonies, and as a counterweight to slaveholding Kentucky, which was admitted to the Union the following year.\n\nIn June 1791, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison toured the state.\n\nBecause of the proximity of Canada, Vermonters were somewhat alarmed during the War of 1812. Five thousand troops were stationed in Burlington at one point, outnumbering residents. About 500 of these died of disease. An expeditionary force of Quebec Eastern Townships' volunteers destroyed a barracks built at Derby with no personnel casualties. The war, fought over what seemed like obscure maritime considerations to landlocked Vermont, was not popular.\n\nIn July 1830, the state experienced what turned out to be the worst flood of the 19th century. It was called the \"Torrent of 1830.\"\n\nMerino sheep were introduced in 1812. This ultimately resulted in a boom-bust cycle for wool. Wool reached a price of 57 cents/pound in 1835. By 1837, there were 1,000,000 sheep in the state. The price of wool dropped to 25 cents/pound in the late 1840s. The state could not withstand more efficient competition from western states, and sheep raising collapsed.\n\nVermont had a unicameral legislature until 1836.\n\nIn June 1843, escaped slaves hid at a Shaftsbury farm, in the first recorded instance in Vermont of the Underground Railroad.\n\nIn 1846, the ground was broken for the construction of the first railroad in Vermont, Central Vermont Railway, in Northfield.\n\nIn 1853, Vermont passed a strict law prohibiting the consumption of alcoholic beverages. Some towns followed the law, while others ignored it.\n\nAn 1854 Vermont Senate report on slavery echoed the Vermont Constitution's first article, on the rights of all men, questioning how a government could favor the rights of one people over another. The report fueled growth of the abolition movement in the state, and in response, a resolution from the Georgia General Assembly authorized the towing of Vermont out to sea. The mid to late 1850s saw a transition from Vermonters mostly favoring slavery's containment, to a far more serious opposition to the institution. As the Whig party shriveled, Vermont changed its allegiance to the emergent Republican Party. In 1860, it voted for President Abraham Lincoln, giving him the largest margin of victory of any state.\n\nFrench-Canadian migration started before the Civil War and accelerated during the 1860s.\n\nMore than 28,100 Vermonters served in Vermont volunteer units. Vermont fielded 17 infantry regiments, one cavalry regiment, three light artillery batteries, one heavy artillery company, three companies of sharpshooters, and two companies of frontier cavalry. Instead of replacing units as they were depleted, Vermont regularly provided recruits to bring the units in the field back up to normal strength. Many of the soldiers had never been out of their own county, much less the state. In the South, they felt like they were on another planet.\n\nIn 1863, there was rioting in West Rutland after the state instituted a draft.\n\nNearly 5,000 Vermonters served in other states' units, in the United States Army or the United States Navy. The 54th Massachusetts Infantry (Colored) included 66 Vermont blacks; a total of 166 black Vermonters served out of a population of 709 in the state. Vermonters, if not Vermont units, participated in every major battle of the war.\n\nVermonters lost a total of 1,832 men killed or mortally wounded in battle; another 3,362 died of disease, in prison or from other causes, for a total loss of 5,194. More than 2,200 Vermonters were taken prisoner during the war, and 615 of them died in, or as a result of, their imprisonment.\nAmong the most famous of the Vermont units were the 1st Vermont Brigade, the 2nd Vermont Brigade, and the 1st Vermont Cavalry.\n\nA large proportion of Vermont's state and national-level politicians for several decades after the Civil War were veterans.\n\nThe northernmost land action of the war, the St. Albans Raid, took place in Vermont.\n\nDuring the two decades following the end of the American Civil War (1864–1885) there was both economic expansion and contraction, and fairly dramatic social change.\n\nUnion veterans banded together into patriotic and fraternal organizations, mostly in the Grand Army of the Republic. There were 116 posts at one time. \n\nMills in Lowell, Massachusetts began staffing up. Recruiters were sent out all over New England, including Vermont. Initially they found ample workers from new widows, single parent heads of family. This demand was filled by August 1865, and recruiting Americans from Lowell ceased abruptly.\n\nBy 1860, the state was a leading producer of hops in the nation with , second to New York. This crop conveniently arrived as a replacement for the disappearance of the Merino sheep trade. Hops, too, disappeared. A number of factors were involved: plant disease in 1909, migration of planting to California from 1853–1910, where growing was performed more efficiently, and Prohibition both at the state and national level.\n\nVermont's system of railroads expanded and was linked to national systems, agricultural output and export soared and incomes increased. But Vermont also felt the effects of recessions and financial panics, particularly the Panic of 1873 which resulted in a substantial exodus of young Vermonters. The transition in thinking about the rights of citizens, first brought to a head by the 1854 Vermont Senate report on slavery, and later Lincoln's Gettysburg Address in changing how citizens perceived civil rights, fueled agitation for women's suffrage. The first election in which women were allowed to vote was on December 18, 1880, when women were granted limited suffrage and were first allowed to vote in town elections, and then in state legislative races.\nStarting around 1870, a number of Vermont towns dressed satirically for Independence Day in an Ancient and Horribles Parade. The intent was to deride politicians and other well-known figures. This largely died out by 1900.\n\nIn 1902, Vermonters approved a law for local option on the sale of alcoholic beverages, countermanding the prior law of 1853 which banned them entirely. That year 94 towns approved the sale of alcoholic beverages locally. The number of approving towns fell each year until there were only 18 in 1917, shortly before national prohibition became law.\n\nIn the 1920s, Ku Klux Klan membership reached 80,300 in the state. The main target of their hatred were the French-Canadian Catholic immigrants.\n\nIn 1923, the state passed a law limiting the regular workweek of women and children to 58 hours.\n\nBeaver populations were re-introduced to Vermont in 1924 and continue to thrive there today.\n\nLarge-scale flooding occurred in early November 1927. During this incident, 85 people died, 84 of them in Vermont.\n\nThe US Supreme Court decided that New Hampshire's boundary included most of the Connecticut River, establishing Vermont's eastern boundary in \"Vermont v. New Hampshire – 290 US 579 (1934).\"\n\nA eugenics project apparently targeted Indians, Indian-French Canadians, and Afro-Americans in the state for forced sterilization between 1931 and 1936.\n\nPrior to 1935, 5.5 million sugar maples were tapped for syrup. Less expansive softwood was used to boil the sap to condense it to maple syrup.\nThe 1938 New England hurricane in the fall of that year blew down of trees, one-third of the total forest at the time in New England. Three billion board feet were salvaged. Today many of the older trees in Vermont are about 75 years old, dating from after this storm. By 2017, the old record number of maples tapped for sugar had not been reached; there were over 2 million trees tapped. However, more syrup was produced using more efficient and less labor-intensive methods.\n\nHydropower supplied 90% of the state's power needs in 1940.\n\nIn September 1941, it looked like America would be involved in the World War which had started in 1939 in Europe. Seizing on a declaration by the U.S. President, the legislature authorized wartime-like payments to citizens involved with the military. This led to facetious headlines that Vermont had declared war on Germany.\n\nAbout 6,000 Vermonters were in the military during World War II. About 874 of these died.\n\n94 Vermonters died fighting the Korean War.\n\nWidespread use of DDT to exterminate insect pests after the war led to the reduction of various wildlife, noticeably birds and larger wildlife, such as moose and bear. The pesticide was banned in 1972 eventually leading to the restoration of many birds and larger mammals. For example, the bear population doubled from the 1980s to 6,000 in 2013.\n\nIn 1964, the US Supreme Court forced \"one-man, one-vote\" redistricting on Vermont, giving cities an equitable share of votes in both houses for the entire country. Until that time, rural counties were often represented equally by area in state senates and were often unsympathetic to urban problems requiring increased taxes.\n\nIn 1965, the Northeast Blackout of 1965, the worst blackout until then, left Vermont without electricity for about 12 hours.\n\nIn 1968, the state took over welfare support for the indigent. This had formerly been the responsibility of the towns, under the Overseer of the Poor. This had been a nearly insupportable burden for many small towns. The last poor farm was closed.\n\nA flood occurred in 1973, when the flood caused the death of two people and millions of dollars in property damage.\n\nIn 1984, the state had in farmland. This declined to in 2013.\n\nOn April 25, 2000, as a result of the Vermont Supreme Court's decision in Baker v. Vermont, the Vermont General Assembly passed and Governor Howard Dean signed into law H.0847, which provided the state-sanctioned benefits of marriage to gay and lesbian couples in the form of civil unions. Controversy over the civil unions bill was a central issue in the subsequent 2000 elections.\n\nIn 2001 Vermont produced 275,000 US gallons (1,040,000 L) of maple syrup, about 25% of U.S. production. For 2005 that number was accounting for 37% of national production.\n\nIn 2007, with three-quarters of the state opposing the Iraq War, the state nevertheless had the highest rate of war-related deaths in the nation. This was due to volunteers and participation by the Vermont National Guard.\n\nDuring the late-2000s recession, state median household income dropped furthest, or second furthest, depending on how it is computed, of any state in the nation; from −3.2% or −10%, depending on whether a two-year or three-year moving average was used.\n\nIn 2011, Tropical Storm Irene caused widespread flooding, particularly in the southern part of the state, closing at least 260 roads. Federal assistance for recovery included $110 million for emergency relief and assistance, $102 million for federal highway repair, and $23 million for individual assistance within the state.\n\nIn 2014, the Center for Public Integrity rated Vermont last out of the 50 states for state government accountability and integrity. This was the result of the revelation of a continuing number of municipal scandals including the $1.6 million Hardwick Electric embezzlement.\n\nVermont is more heavily forested in 2017 than it was during the 19th and early 20th centuries. A new way of producing potash was found not requiring the intensive destruction of trees.\n\nThough some members of the Federalist Party found electoral success, in its early years of statehood Vermont generally preferred the Jeffersonian Party, which became the Democratic Party in the early 1820s. Vermont stopped voting Democratic in the 1830s, initially over a fear of Jacksonian return to political parties; later, perhaps, over increasing opposition to the spread of slavery. The state voted Anti-Jackson, Anti-Masonic, Whig, and then Republican Party.\n\nThe Vermont legislature chose presidential electors through the general election of 1824. Vermont citizens first started voting directly for presidential electors in 1828.\n\nIn the 1830s Vermont was one of the strongholds of Anti-Masonry. While the party elected only one Governor, William A. Palmer, it was able to prevent the other major parties from winning majorities in some statewide races, which meant that the Vermont General Assembly chose the winner.\n\nFrom the founding of the Republican party in the mid-1850s until the 1958 election of William H. Meyer to the United States House of Representatives, Vermont elected only Republicans to statewide office.\n\nPoliticians aspiring to statewide office in Vermont normally had to be nominated at a state convention or \"caucus.\" Factions dominated these caucuses. Some of these were family. A look at the list of Governors, Senators and Representatives over time shows the Chittendens, Fairbanks, Proctors, and Smiths. Nomination was tantamount to election. The state legislature chose US senators until 1913. Up to six seats in the US House of Representatives gave ambitious politicians an ample stage for their talent.\n\nUntil 1870, all state officials were elected for one-year terms. In 1870, the term was changed to two-years. Governors then normally served just one term of two years.\n\nThe Green Mountains effectively split Vermont in two. Culturally the eastern Vermonters were often descended from immigrants from New Hampshire. Western Vermonters often had their roots in New York. Recognizing this as a source of potential problems, politicians began following an unwritten \"mountain rule\", rotating the Lieutenant Governor and Governor residing in opposite sides of the state.\n\nThe first election in which women were allowed to vote was on December 18, 1880, when women were granted limited suffrage and were allowed to vote in school board elections.\n\nGeneral annoyance with this system of selecting leadership by a few people, led to statewide primaries in 1916. Down to only one congressional seat to compete for, Governors started trying to serve two terms, beginning with Governor Weeks in 1927. This worked until World War II.\n\nSenator Ernest Gibson died in 1940. Governor George Aiken, a liberal ally of the Gibsons appointed the late Senator's son, Ernest W. Gibson, Jr. to fill the seat until a special election for the remainder of the term. The younger Gibson did not run, enabling Aiken's election to the seat. Instead Gibson devoted himself to preparing the state for entry into World War II. He served in the South Pacific and emerged as a highly decorated Colonel. There was a tsunami in 1946 in American politics. Returning veterans were popular. Gibson ran an unprecedented campaign against the incumbent Governor, Mortimer R. Proctor, and ousted him in the primary. Gibson won the general election, won reelection in 1948, and served until resigning in 1950 to accept appointment as Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Vermont.\n\nThe elder Gibson, a former member of the Progressive Party, was the first of the liberal Republicans. While conservatives like Harold Arthur and Lee E. Emerson were elected Governor, they seem, in retrospect, to be transitory figures.\n\nThe \"normal\" path to the governorship for Republicans, which Ernest Gibson, Jr. explicitly campaigned against in 1946, was to serve in the Vermont House of Representatives and hold a leadership position such as Speaker of the House; service in the Vermont State Senate and a leadership role such as President Pro Tem; election to the Lieutenant Governor's office; and election as Governor.\n\nSuccessful Republican candidates for the United States House of Representatives and United States Senate were also almost always veterans of leadership positions in the Vermont Legislature or statewide office.\n\nIn 1962, Philip Hoff was elected Governor, the first Democrat since before the Civil War.\n\nThe demographics of the state had changed. In 1960, 25% of the population was born outside the state. Most of these immigrants were from Democratic states and brought their voting inclinations with them. Anticipating this change, the Republicans conducted a massive free-for-all in 1958, the last good chance many of them saw to capture a congressional seat. They were wrong. Democrat William H. Meyer won, the first from his party in 102 years.\n\nWhile the climate had changed, the legislature had not. With one representative per town and two senators per county, the rural areas dominated and set the agenda much to the frustration of urban areas, particularly Chittenden County. In 1964, the US Supreme Court forced \"one-man, one-vote\" redistricting on Vermont, giving cities an equitable share of votes in both houses.\n\nUnlike yesteryear, no party nominee can be assured of election. The unwritten \"two term\" rule has been jettisoned. Governors usually serve as long as they can, not being able to guarantee that their policies will be continued after they leave office. Vermonters have alternated parties in the Governor's office since 1962. Democratic governors have served longer.\n\nTransportation around this mountainous state was a challenge to the original colonists. While this challenge has been met in the current era by turnpikes and limited rail service, public transportation for the majority of Vermonters has often remained elusive.\n\nThe state highway system was created in 1931.\n\nIn 2008, the Vermont Transit Lines, a subsidiary of Greyhound Lines went out of business. It had begun operating in 1973. Limited service continued under the direct aegis of Greyhound. This has been replaced by subsidized regional NGO corporations which provide limited service for most, but adequate service for those needing medical treatment.\n\nIn colonial times, like many of its neighboring states, Vermont's largest religious affiliation was Congregationalism. In 1776, 63% of affiliated church members in Vermont were Congregationalists. At that time, however, only 9% of people belonged to a specific church due to the remoteness of population centers.\n\n\n"}

The Tour began in Dunkirk with a prologue individual time trial on 7 July and Stage 10 occurred on 17 July with mountainous stage to Alpe d'Huez. The race finished on the Champs-Élysées in Paris on 29 July.\n\n7 July 2001 — Dunkerque, (ITT)\n\nOne of the favorites to win the prologue, last year's winner David Millar, fell in the last curve, and thus was only 110th. Winner was Christophe Moreau, but his gains on most other favorites were small, with the exception of Casagrande, who was 120th and lost 45 seconds. Stuart O'Grady (8th) and Jaan Kirsipuu (11th) are well-placed sprinters who might gain the yellow jersey in the coming days (there are seconds 'bonification' for the riders who score high on the final or intermediate sprints)\n\n8 July 2001 — Saint-Omer to Boulogne-sur-Mer, \n\nFrenchman Jacky Durand, well known for his attacking style, did it again. He was chased, and finally joined, by his fellow countryman Christophe Oriol. The two escapers were caught back by the peloton, but Durand had managed to be first on two small (4th category) climbs, and thus was the first wearer of the mountain jersey this Tour de France. Laurent Brochard tried to get away in the last kilometres, but in the very last kilometre was caught back. Thus, the stage became a mass sprint, won by Erik Zabel.\n\n9 July 2001 — Calais to Antwerp, \n\nA group of 16 riders escaped from the peloton, and stayed away until the end, although with only a small difference. Because sprinter Stuart O'Grady was present, he was expected to take both the stage and the yellow jersey, but the Rabobank team had different plans. Their rider Erik Dekker, who took 3 stages in 2000, was present, and was expected to try something, but instead he helped his teammate Marc Wauters to escape. Marc got Arnaud Pretot with him, and they scored first and second. Because he also had had a good prologue, this was enough for Wauters to take the yellow as well.\n\n10 July 2001 — Antwerp to Seraing, \n\nThe stage seemed to be a likely prey for Erik Zabel: Some mountains (in the Ardennes), too tough for the pure sprinters, but not tough enough to really break the peloton, with a spurt going uphill. His team worked hard for him, even though this might cost them some power which they might need to help Jan Ullrich in the mountains. Marc Wauters had the honor to drive through the village where he lives ahead in the yellow, but later had to let the peloton go in the Ardennes. Apparently, the pressure got too much for him, for although he is certainly not a climber, he normally should not lose any time on a hill stage like this. Another person who lost time was Francesco Casagrande, still suffering from a broken arm he got in May. Because Wauters dropped out, Stuart O'Grady got to wear the yellow jersey after all, one day later than expected.\n\n11 July 2001 — Huy to Verdun, \n\nPatrice Halgand was the great attacker in the first part of the stage, which gained him the mountains jersey. In the end this led to a break-away group of nine. The nine riders got up to 10 minutes ahead, but the teams of US Postal (Armstrong) and ONCE (Beloki and Gonzalez de Galdeano) started chasing, because the break-away also contained Bobby Julich and Michael Boogerd, who might well be considered dangerous outsiders. The heavy chase combined with a strong wind against caused the peloton to break. All favorites as well as yellow jersey O'Grady were in the first group, but still some riders who could well place in the top-10 were left behind. After the nine were caught, the second group could rejoin, but the combined group of about 80 riders gained 18 minutes over a lot of other riders. Laurent Jalabert, Francisco Mancebo and Ludo Dierckxsens managed to escape. Mancebo in the end was caught back, but Jalabert and Dierckxsens were just a few seconds ahead of the (first) peloton, the first winning the sprint. One favorite was lost for this year's Tour definitively, because Casagrande abandoned.\n\n12 July 2001 — Verdun to Bar-le-Duc, (TTT)\n\nA team time trial, one of the hardest disciplines of cycling. The riders, going by team, have to make the fastest time for their team (fifth to arrive counts). Where it was expected that O'Grady would lose some time here on the major contestants for the general classification, his team surprised everyone by actually winning the stage. The ONCE team, considered the great favorites, placed second. Loser of the day was Jan Ullrich, who lost 30 seconds on Lance Armstrong (US Postal) and 1 minute on Joseba Beloki (ONCE). In the results the major GC contenders of each team are given between brackets. In the general classification, Crédit Agricole now takes places 1 to 3, while the rest of the top-10 are all ONCE riders except for Moreau.\n\n13 July 2001 — Commercy to Strasbourg, \n\nLittle happened in this stage. A group of 5 riders (Axel Merckx, Michele Bartoli, Laurent Brochard, Rik Verbrugghe and Fred Bessy) got ahead with a maximum lead of 3 minutes, but was caught back by the joint work of Crédit Agricole and the sprint teams. The sprint was won by Estonian Jaan Kirsipuu. Belgian sprinter Tom Steels originally placed fourth, but because of 'irregular riding' during the sprint was declassified to the last place of the peloton.\n\n14 July 2001 — Strasbourg to Colmar, \n\nAlthough the Alps were not yet there, this was quite a mountainous ride through the Vosges. A breakaway group of five stayed ahead (the unlucky Basso crashing), containing German Jens Voigt, who thus took over the yellow jersey from his teammate O'Grady. Laurent Jalabert took his second stage win in this still young Tour de France - on the French national holiday, moreover.\n\n15 July 2001 — Colmar to Pontarlier, \n\nThe peloton took a day-off, but not so a group of 14 riders that had broken away. In the end they had a lead of almost 36 minutes, by far the largest one achieved in recent history. Even a lead of 22 minutes had not occurred in the last 25 years. Formally, this meant that the whole peloton finished outside the time limits, but the referees understandably used a rule that they could give clemency to any group of more than 20% of the stage's starting riders, officially citing the weather conditions as their reason to do so. Still, the effects on the general classification were huge: Stuart O'Grady, who was in the group, retook the yellow jersey, and was now over 35 minutes ahead of Armstrong. Armstrong also had to make good over half an hour on Frenchman François Simon. Perhaps even more dangerous was Andrei Kivilev. He was 'only' 13 minutes ahead of Armstrong, but unlike the others from the escape group, was known to be good in the mountains, so he needed not lose very much on the toppers in the rest of the Tour. Memories went back to 1990, when in the first stage a group of four riders won 15 minutes. One of them, Claudio Chiappucci, held on to the end, and ended second, only 2 minutes behind winner Greg Lemond.\n\nAmong the fourteen breakaways was Erik Dekker, who had won a surprising three stages in the 2000 Tour de France. In the end phase of the stage, he escaped from the group, getting joined by fellow Dutchman Servais Knaven. Spanish Aitor Gonzalez set out to bridge the gap, and succeeded; however, in doing so, he also brought Dekker's teammate Marc Wauters (who had won in Antwerp and had worn the yellow jersey for one day). With the help of Wauters, Dekker had no difficulty winning the sprint, and thus he could add a fourth Tour stage to his list of wins.\n\n16 July 2001 — Pontarlier to Aix-les-Bains, \n\nThe stage started very fast, with many attacks. It was Bradley McGee and Davide Etxebarria who managed to make a gap of 1'20. Sergei Ivanov went after them and bridged the gap. The three leaders, chased by Momo Agnolutto, got a maximum of 7 minutes, but after that, the joined forces of \"Bonjour\" (of sprinter Damien Nazon) and \"Telekom\" (Zabel) quickly reduced the difference. Agnolutto was caught back, but the others managed to stay away, albeit only by a few seconds. Ivanov looked tired, and did not do his part of the work, but that appeared to be just a fake, trying to save his strength. He escaped, and went to the finish alone.\n\n17 July 2001 — Aix-les-Bains to Alpe d'Huez, \n\nFinally the mountains were reached, and the work started for the riders who went for the general classification. Only one normal Alps stage this year, plus a climbing time trial (stage 11).\n\nLaurent Roux, Eladio Jimenez and Toni Tauler were the early attackers this stage, and by the time the riders reached the first of three 'hors category' climbs, the \"Madeleine\", they were 13'35 ahead of a peloton of about 45 riders. The \"Telekom\" team of Jan Ullrich led this peloton, hoping to make it a tough race. On the second climb, the \"Glandon\", only one man was still up front, Roux, and he was 7 minutes before the peloton. In that peloton, Armstrong seemed to be in problems. Where usually he would climb in the front of the group, he was now in the back, and his facial expressions were also not that positive. Furthermore, only two riders from his team (Roberto Heras and Jose Luis Rubiera) were with him.\n\nBut when the final mountain, the famous \"Alpe d'Huez\" was reached, things were shown to be very different, it looked like Armstrong had been bluffing in order to tempt Ullrich and his team into wasting their energy by forcing the pace too early in the stage. Rubiera attacked on the start of the climb, Armstrong followed, but only a few other riders did - in the end it is just Armstrong and Ullrich. When Rubiera has to drop off, Armstrong looks back. The camera angle made it appear as if he looks straight into the eyes of Ullrich, but in a later interview Armstrong denied this, saying he was looking for who else was around. Armstrong then attacks again. Ullrich cannot respond to Armstrong who loses him and climbs the Alpe alone. He overtakes Roux, and climbs up the Alpe d'Huez in 38'01\" - only 26 seconds short of Marco Pantani's record from 1995, scored after a much lighter stage. Kivilev (12th at 4.39) keeps up well, and seems likely to take the yellow jersey in the Pyrenees, whilst Ullrich battles hard to limit his losses and take 2nd place on the stage. For now, the yellow is on the shoulders of François Simon, who scored a creditable 29th place (10.20 behind Armstrong). Stuart O'Grady ends way in the back. After having worn it six days, he says goodbye to the yellow jersey. He is now concentrating on the green one. Armstrong is now the first of the favourites, at fourth place. He will still have to deal with Simon and Kivilev before getting the yellow.\n"}

Key features include the ability to choose which changes to accept from other repositories, interaction with either other local (on-disk) repositories or remote repositories via SSH, HTTP, or email, and an unusually interactive interface. The developers also emphasize the use of advanced software tools for verifying correctness: the expressive type system of the functional programming language Haskell enforces some properties, and randomized testing via QuickCheck verifies many others. The name is a recursive acronym for Darcs Advanced Revision Control System.\n\nDarcs treats patches as first-class citizens. For the user, a repository can be seen as a set of patches, where each patch is not necessarily ordered with respect to other patches, i.e. the set of patches is only a partially ordered set. In many cases patches can be independently transmitted between various repositories.\n\nMany branching, merging, and cherry-picking operations that would require additional commands with snapshot-based systems like Git or Mercurial can be directly done with Darcs with the usual \"pull\" and \"push\" commands. In terms of user interface, this means that Darcs has fewer commands. These commands are more interactive: one can choose more precisely which patches they want to exchange with remote repositories.\n\nThe patches of a repository are linearly ordered. Darcs automatically calculates whether patches can be reordered (an operation called commutation), and how to do it. These calculations implement a so-called \"patch theory\".\n\nA Darcs patch can contain changes of the following kinds:\n\nThe notion of dependency between patches is defined syntactically. Intuitively, a patch \"B\" depends on another patch \"A\" if \"A\" provides the content that \"B\" modifies. This means that patches that modify different parts of the code are considered, by default, independent. To address cases when this is not desirable, Darcs enables the user to specify explicit dependencies between patches.\n\nSince version 2.10, Darcs uses patience diff by default.\n\nDarcs evolved out of David Roundy's efforts to design a new patch format for GNU arch in June 2002. These discussions didn't lead to any code being committed to Arch, but did lead to the conception of the theory of patches. After writing an initial version of Darcs in C++, the Haskell version was written in Autumn 2002 and released to the public in April 2003. Darcs 2.0 was released in April 2008 and introduced a more robust repository format, as well as a new patch semantics called \"darcs-2\", aimed at minimizing exponential merge issues. The current development strategy focuses on implementing optimizations and adding new features, while maintaining the same repository format.\n\nDarcs has been criticized on the grounds of performance. One of the most notable issues was related to the merge algorithm in Darcs 1.x, which could do exponential work to merge some conflicts. Although the issue was not completely corrected in Darcs 2, the frequency of exponential merges has been reduced. Bugs still remain in which merging of recursive conflicts fails.\n\n"}

The Tour began in Dunkirk with a prologue individual time trial on 7 July and Stage 11 occurred on 18 July with an individual time trial from Grenoble. The race finished on the Champs-Élysées in Paris on 29 July.\n\n18 July 2001 — Grenoble to Chamrousse, (ITT)\n\nA mountain time trial was part of the Tour de France for the first time in several years. Lance Armstrong once again showed that he is the #1 contender for this year's tour. Laiseka, Sevilla and Montgomery all have a good result. Kivilev, however, falters, placing 32nd at more than 6 minutes behind Armstrong. He is a good climber but not a skilled time trialist.\n\n19 July 2001 — Perpignan\n\n20 July 2001 — Perpignan to Ax-les-Thermes, \n\nAfter stage 11 there was a rest day, although the amount of rest the riders actually did get was diminished by the fact that they had to make a long transportation. Stage 12 was the first of three stages in the Pyrenees. In the first stages of the race, Italian Paolo Bettini was the great attacker. Grouping with Stuart O'Grady and finally alone, he was ahead for a long time. In the final climb, however, he was caught by two other riders who were better climbers: Spain's David Etxebarria and Colombia's Felix Cardenas. By then, the Tour was already over for Christophe Moreau: He suffered what was probably a case of food poisoning, and abandoned.\n\nBehind the three riders, Armstrong, Ullrich and Kivilev had escaped from the group of favorites. When Ullrich attacked, Kivilev was unable to follow. At the front, Etxebarria made a few attempts, which dropped Bettini but not Cardenas. When Cardenas himself attacked, Etxebarria was unable to follow. Armstrong and Ullrich were joined by Roberto Laiseka, who soon left the two favorites behind and started chasing Cardenas. Beloki tried to reach the Armstrong-Ullrich duo, but failed. Armstrong managed to get away from Ullrich, but he could not further overtake Laiseka and Cardenas. Simon lost another 4 minutes to Armstrong, who moved within half a minute of Kivilev.\n\n21 July 2001 — Foix to Saint-Lary-Soulan Pla d'Adet, \n\nA group of nine attacked early. On the first climb, Laurent Roux took the points, strengthening his position, then Laurent Jalabert attacked, and started a long solo. Behind him, the group got smaller and smaller, in the end only Alexandre Vinokourov and Stive Vermaut remained.\n\nJan Ullrich attacked on the Peyresourde, and escaped together with Lance Armstrong and Ullrich's teammate Kevin Livingston, who had escaped earlier. However, during the descent he mis-judged a curve, and ended up off the road. Luckily, both bicycle and rider had no severe damage, and Ullrich quickly was able to ride again. Armstrong had not mis-used Ullrich's problems to attack, and Ullrich rejoined a group with Armstrong, Beloki and a few others. By now, all original escapers but Jalabert had been caught back, between Jaja and the group-Armstrong/Ullrich, there was only Stefano Garzelli left.\n\nJalabert, understandably tired of his long solo on a very difficult stage, was in problems during the final climb. Armstrong had chosen this climb for yet another attack. First his teammate Rubiera led the group, then Heras took over. Only Armstrong and Ullrich were able to follow. Heras himself had to drop off too later, and Armstrong managed to ride away from Ullrich. Jalabert's long solo was not rewarded with a stage win, Armstrong and five others took him over. However, it did bring him both the mountains jersey and the first place in the most combative rider classification. He would keep both to the finish in Paris.\n\nArmstrong dedicated his win to Fabio Casartelli, his (then) teammate, who died after a fall on the Portet d'Aspet, this stage's first climb, in the Tour de France of 1995. Apart from the stage, he also took over the first place in the general classification. Kivilev and Simon still hang on, in second and third place.\n\n22 July 2001 — Tarbes to Luz Ardiden, \n\nThe last mountain stage of this Tour de France. At the first climb, a group of 10 riders was ahead, but at the second climb, the Tourmalet, the highest point of this year's Tour (), Sven Montgomery and Mario Aerts lost everyone but David Moncoutié and Bobby Julich, with the latter not looking good either. Julich did indeed drop off, as did Montgomery during the descent. The other two were caught back by Wladimir Belli, who attacked on the final climb to Luz Ardiden, hoping to win the stage in a solo.\n\nHowever, the group with Armstrong, Ullrich and the other favourites was only one minute behind, and from this group Roberto Laiseka attacked, and passed the remaining escapers one by one, finally passing Belli and getting ready for the win 5 km before the finish. Armstrong again ordered Heras to turn up the speed, and again Armstrong and Ullrich were the only ones who were able to follow. When Heras also had to drop off, Ullrich attacked, but Armstrong did not break, and together the two went to the finish, hand-in-hand with Armstrong not contesting the third-place time bonus. Ullrich took the second place in the general classification, Beloki still has to gain 1'20\" on Kivilev in the time trial to gain third place.\n\n23 July 2001 — Pau\n\n24 July 2001 — Pau to Lavaur, \n\nAfter the second resting day, and this time without a move, the last tour week started. Expected were some breaks to keep getting away, and a mass spurt in the last stage and maybe once or twice more. For the general classification, only the time trial (stage 18) seems important.\n\nStage 15 fits nicely in this pattern, but with a small twist. After a wild start, with many attacks, a group of 25 riders got away, and at the finish had 15 minutes over the peloton. In the final stages, attacks happened in this group too, and Italian Marco Pinotti managed to get away. However, Belgian Rik Verbrugghe did the same, and after a long chase managed to reach Pinotti – not really unexpectedly, as Verbrugghe is known to be a good time trialist. The rest of the group would finish just a few seconds after the two. The spurt was easily won by Verbrugghe, Pinotti simply having not enough energy already in the last kilometers.\n\nThe little twist is that one of the riders in the group ahead was Michael Boogerd, who managed to climb from 16th to 8th place in the general classification, thus causing some change in the top 10 after all. The \"Kelme\" team of Santiago Botero tried to diminish the group's lead, so as to keep their leader in front of Boogerd in the general classification, but to no avail. Still, Boogerd was not satisfied. He would gladly have given his top-ten position for the stage win. Even less satisfied was Alessandro Petacchi, who easily won the spurt of the group, but realised that he had missed his chance of a stage win.\n\n25 July 2001 — Castelsarrasin to Sarran, \n\nThe stage went like the last one: Many attacks at the start, resulting in a group getting away and staying away. This time the group was smaller, just seven riders, but again someone escaped from the group around before the end. It was German attacker Jens Voigt; Australian time trialist Bradley McGee was the only one who was able to follow. In the uphill finish, McGee was not able to follow Voigt, who thus got a well-deserved stage win. In the peloton, a crash unfortunately forced several riders to resign.\n\n26 July 2001 — Brive-la-Gaillarde to Montluçon, \n\nEarly on a group of 16 riders escaped. When \"US Postal\" gave up chasing, their lead rapidly grew, but then the \"Bonjour\" team of Damien Nazon decided to lead the chase, and some other teams with sprinters (in particular \"Telekom\") joined in. This caused the gap to become less again. Up front, Lelli attacked, and Baguet and Piil joined in. The rest of the group was caught by the peloton. Lelli, suffering from cramps, stopped working at the front, but the riders managed to stay ahead nevertheless. Baguet won the sprint.\n\n27 July 2001 — Montluçon to Saint-Amand-Montrond, (ITT)\n\nThe last stage that is supposed to be important for the final standings is an individual time trial. Armstrong, starting last because he is first in the general classification, shows once again his great form in this year's Tour, and gets his fourth stage, over 1 minute faster than number 2, Igor Gonzalez de Galdeano (although he is known as a good time trialist, still a slight surprise, as Ullrich is also a good time trialist and clearly the second-best in this Tour). Kivilev rode an excellent time trial given his weakness on this specialization, finishing 18th, but it was not enough to avoid losing third place to Beloki. Perhaps the greatest surprise of this stage was the fourth place of Frenchman Didier Rous.\n\n28 July 2001 — Orléans to Évry, \n\nProbably the least exciting stage of this year's Tour, stage 19 had no major escapes (Jens Voigt attacking more to help teammate Stuart O'Grady by avoiding too many points going to Erik Zabel), and ended in a mass sprint. \"Deutsche Telekom\" had worked hard to keep the group together, and was rewarded with Zabel's second stage win. O'Grady, finishing second, did remain ahead of Zabel in the points classification, but the difference is only 2 points now.\n\n29 July 2001 — Corbeil Essones to Paris, \n\nAs traditional, the last stage went to the Champs-Élysées in Paris, and as traditionally a number of attackers was unable to stay away from a peloton led by the groups of the sprinters. Although \"Française des Jeux\" had been working hard for Jimmy Casper, it was Jan Svorada who found himself well ahead about 200 meters from the finish. None of the other sprinters had a chance to overtake him. Erik Zabel was second, and had amassed enough points to take the green jersey from Stuart O'Grady. Zabel now had won the points classification for the sixth year in row. No one else had succeeded in winning the classification six times.\n"}

It is a member of the South American bird family Furnariidae.\n\nThe yellow-chinned spinetail is typically 15 cm long, and weighs 15 g. It is a slender bird with a long tail. The upperparts and head are chestnut brown, and the underparts are whitish apart from the pale yellow throat. The sexes are similar, but there are several subspecies, differing in forecrown colour or upperparts tone.\n\nIts call is a shrill rattling.\n\nThe yellow-chinned spinetail is found in all contiguous regions of Brazil, except specific parts of the Amazon Basin. In northern South America, the species is mainly found along the coast, in a continuous coastal strip that extends from the mouth of the Amazon River's mouth through northern Brazil's Amapá state, the Guianas – extending to the headwaters of the south-flowing Branco River in the north central of Brazil's Roraima state as it borders the Guiana Highlands –, Venezuela, where its range extends more widely inland along the Orinoco River, to northern Colombia where it ranges up the Madeira River valley beyond the Serranía de las Quinchas.\n\nFurther south, like its sister species, the red-and-white spinetail (\"C. mustelinus\") it is found along the Amazon River corridor. From the upper Amazon exiting the Andes, it only occurs in the river corridor, then bifurcating up the Madeira River, southwestwards into Bolivia. From there, it ranges along the Andean foothills to northwestern Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay and finally the Rio de la Plata. It is apparently absent from much of Pará and northern Mato Grosso states, essentially between the Madeira and Araguaia River corridors. But apart from that region it occurs in most of South America in the area enclosed by – running counterclockwise – the lower Amazon and the Madeira river, the Andes, the Paraguay and lower Paraná rivers, and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThis species is a common resident breeder in marshes and the edges of mangrove swamps; in general its habitat is open woodland in the vicinity of rivers. The yellow-chinned spinetail feeds on insects and spiders, keeping low and often in the open. It is a conspicuous, confiding and noisy bird. Unlike the related ovenbirds, the yellow-chinned spinetail constructs a large spherical stick nest, usually low in a mangrove or other marsh vegetation. The tubular entrance tunnel rises almost vertically from the base to the top of the nest. The normal clutch is three, sometimes four, greenish white eggs.\n\nThis spinetail is parasitised by the striped cuckoo (\"Tapera naevia\"), which lays one or two eggs in the nest, but it is not known how the cuckoo enters the nest or whether it or its offspring eject the host's young.\n\nThis widely ranging bird is not considered threatened by the IUCN.\n\n\n"}

Some can be toxic or generate toxic chemicals from reactions with chemicals produced by the body, as is the case with many examples of ingested metal objects.\n\nWith sufficient force (as in firing of bullets), a foreign body can become lodged into nearly any tissue.\n\nOne of the most common locations for a foreign body is the alimentary tract.\n\nIt is possible for foreign bodies to enter the tract from the mouth or rectum.\n\nBoth children and adults experience problems caused by foreign objects becoming lodged within their bodies. Young children, in particular, are naturally curious and may intentionally put shiny objects, such as coins or button batteries, into their mouths. They also like to insert objects into their ear canals and nostrils. The severity of a foreign body can range from unconcerning to a life-threatening emergency. For example, a coin causes local pressure on the tissue but generally is not a medical emergency to remove. A button battery, which can be a very similar size to a coin, generates hydroxide ions at the anode and causes a chemical burn in two hours. An ingested button battery that is stuck in the esophagus is a medical emergency. In 2009, Avolio Luigi and Martucciello Giuseppe showed that although ingested nonmagnetic foreign bodies are likely to be passed spontaneously without consequence, ingested magnets (magnetic toys) may attract each other through children's intestinal walls and cause severe damage, such as pressure necrosis, perforation, intestinal fistulas, volvulus, and obstruction.\n\nIt is possible for a foreign body to enter the airways and cause choking.\n\nIn one study, peanuts were the most common obstruction. In addition to peanuts, hot dogs, grapes, and latex balloons are also serious choking hazards in children that can result in death. A latex balloon will conform to the shape of the trachea, blocking the airway and making it difficult to expel with the Heimlich maneuver.\n\nForeign body in the bronchi can also present as chronic cough.\n\nAirborne particles can lodge in the eyes of people at any age. These foreign bodies often result in allergies which are either temporary or even turn into a chronic allergy. This is especially evident in the case of dust particles.\n\nIt is also possible for larger objects to lodge in the eye. The most common cause of intraocular foreign bodies is hammering.. Corneal foreign bodies are often encountered due to occupational exposure and can be prevented by instituting safety eye-wear at work place. \n\nForeign bodies in the eye affect about 2 per 1,000 people per year.\n\nSplinters are common foreign bodies in skin. \"Staphylococcus aureus\" infection often causes boils to form around them.\n\nTetanus prophylaxis may be appropriate.\n\nForeign bodies in the peritoneum can include retained surgical instruments after abdominal surgery. Rarely, an intrauterine device can perforate the uterine wall and enter the peritoneum.\n\nForeign bodies in the peritoneum eventually become contained in a foreign body granuloma. In the extremely rare case of retained ectopic pregnancy, this forms a lithopedion.\n\nForeign bodies can also become lodged in other locations:\n\nForeign bodies are common in animals, especially young dogs and cats. Dogs will readily eat toys, bones, and any object that either has food on it or retains the odor of food. Unlike humans, dogs are susceptible to gastrointestinal obstruction due to their ability to swallow relatively large objects and pass them through the esophagus. Foreign bodies most commonly become lodged in the stomach because of the inability to pass through the pyloric sphincter into the jejunum. Symptoms of gastrointestinal obstruction include vomiting, abdominal pain often characterized by aggression, acute infection, and depression due to dehydration. Treatment of a foreign body is determined by its severity. The amount of time a foreign body is present, location of the object, degree of obstruction, previous health status of the animal and the type of material from which the foreign body is made can all determine the severity of the condition. Peritonitis results if either the stomach or intestine has ruptured. Foreign bodies in the stomach can sometimes be removed by endoscopic retrieval or if necessary by gastrotomy. Very often, a simple instrument to remove foreign bodies without operation endoscopy is the Hartmann Alligator Forceps. The instrument is manufactured from 8 cm to 1 m length. Foreign bodies in the jejunum are removed by enterotomy.\n\nCertain foreign bodies in animals are especially problematic. Bones or objects with sharp edges may cause tearing of the wall of the esophagus, stomach, or small intestine and lead to peritonitis. Pennies swallowed in large numbers may cause zinc poisoning, which in dogs leads to severe gastroenteritis and hemolytic anemia. Linear foreign bodies can especially be dangerous. A linear foreign body is usually a length of string or yarn with a larger object or clump of material at either end. One end is usually lodged in the stomach or proximal small intestine and the other end continues to travel through the intestines. The material becomes tightly stretched and the intestines may \"accordion up\" on themselves or be lacerated by it. This is especially common in cats who may enjoy playing with a ball of string or yarn. Sometimes the linear foreign body anchors in the mouth by catching under the tongue. Pantyhose is a common linear foreign body in dogs.\n\n"}

It was part of the palace complex of ancient Silla (57 BCE – 935 CE). It was constructed by order of King Munmu in 674 CE. The pond is situated at the northeast edge of the Banwolseong palace site, in central Gyeongju. It is an oval shape; 200m from east to west and 180m from north to south. It contains three small islands.\n\nAnapji was originally located near the palace of Silla called Banwolseong. It is written in Samguk Sagi: \"During the era of King Munmu, a new pond was made in the palace and flowers and birds flourished in this pond\". There is also mention of a royal reception held by King Gyeongsun in 931, when Silla was already crumbling.\nAfter the fall of Silla, the pond fell into disrepair for many centuries. The name \"Anapji\" appears in the 16th century Joseon era document \"Augmented Survey of the Geography of Korea\" (hangul:동국여지승람, hanja:東國輿地勝覽) with the explanation that King Munmu made the pond with Taoist aesthetics.\n\nAs part of the renovation project of historic sites in Gyeongju, Anapji was dredged and rebuilt in 1974. The long-term excavation project from March 1975 to December 1986 released a large number of relics from the pond. Research revealed that the pond had been surrounded by stone walls, and that 5 buildings had been standing on the pond's west to south sides. Waterway systems were also detected.\nAlmost 33,000 pieces of historic relics were excavated from the site. An abundance of unique and extraordinarily designed roof tiles, architectural materials, pottery, gilt bronze figures of Buddha, jewelry, accessories and other everyday items were discovered, offering an insight to Buddhist art and everyday life in Silla.\n\nAnapji is currently allotted in Inwang-dong, Gyeongju and is part of Gyeongju National Park. Approximately 730 relics are on display at the Anapji Exhibition Hall, the special gallery of the Gyeongju National Museum. The site of \"Imhaejeon\" is also a part of the grounds, the most important building on the property and the structure used as the crown prince’s palace. While some sites have been restored others have been left in the natural form.\n\n\n\n"}

It is located in Liberty Park at the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan, New York City. Originally located at the Austin J. Tobin Plaza, the centerpiece survived the collapse of the World Trade Center towers, which resulted from the September 11 attacks in 2001.\n\n\"The Sphere\" was recovered from the rubble, visibly damaged but largely intact. After being dismantled and stored near a hangar at John F. Kennedy International Airport, the sculpture was the subject of the 2001 documentary \"Koenig's Sphere\". On March 11, 2002, six months after the attack, the sculpture was moved temporarily to Battery Park, where in unrestored condition it was rededicated (September 11, 2002) with an eternal flame. \n\nHaving become a major tourist attraction, the unrestored sculpture was rededicated on August 16, 2017 by the Port Authority at a permanent location in Liberty Park, overlooking the September 11 Memorial and its original location.\n\n\"The Sphere\" is high and cast in 52 bronze segments. Koenig called it his \"biggest child\". It was put together in Bremen, West Germany and shipped as a whole to Lower Manhattan.\n\nThe artwork was meant to symbolize world peace through world trade, and was placed at the center of a ring of fountains and other decorative touches designed by WTC architect Minoru Yamasaki to mimic the Grand Mosque of Mecca, Masjid al-Haram, in which \"The Sphere\" stood at the place of the Kaaba.\n\nThe piece was commissioned by the owner of the World Trade Center, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ), in 1966. The Authority's original choice had been Henry Moore, but Koenig was chosen after architect Minoru Yamasaki saw some of Koenig's work at the Staempfli Gallery in Manhattan. Koenig started work in 1967 while the WTC was in the planning stages, and finished it four years later. Originally titled Grosse Kugelkaryatide N.Y. by the artist, the sculpture was soon referred to as \"The Sphere.\"\n\nAfter the September 11 attacks, upon recovery from the rubble pile the sculpture was dismantled and sent to storage near John F. Kennedy International Airport. Its extraction had been widely covered in local news media in the New York metropolitan area. As it was a memorable feature of the Twin Towers site, there was much discussion about using it in a memorial, especially since it seemed to have survived the attacks relatively unscathed.\n\nGerman film director Percy Adlon, who had twice previously devoted films to Koenig, made \"Koenigs Kugel\" (Koenig's Sphere) at a time when the sculpture's fate was still uncertain. In the film, the artist and the director visit Ground Zero five weeks after the attacks as the former retells the story of its creation. At first, Koenig opposed reinstalling \"The Sphere,\" considering it \"a beautiful corpse\".\n\nThe sculpture was eventually returned to Manhattan, and on March 11, 2002, six months to the day after the attacks, it was re-erected in Battery Park, near the Hope Garden, several blocks away from where it once stood. Koenig himself supervised the work; it took four engineers and 15 ironworkers to create a new base. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, his predecessor Rudy Giuliani and other local officials spoke at a ceremony rededicating it as a memorial to the victims. \"It was a sculpture, now it's a monument\", Koenig said, noting how the relatively fragile metal globe had mostly survived the cataclysm. \"It now has a different beauty, one I could never imagine. It has its own life – different from the one I gave to it.\"\n\nA plaque alongside \"The Sphere\" read as follows:\n\nAccording to NYC Parks spokeswoman Vickie Karp, the city was looking to relocate \"The Sphere\" in summer 2012, when construction began to restore Battery Park’s lawn, requiring the sculpture to be moved. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ), which owns \"The Sphere\", considered placing the sculpture in Liberty Park, located between the 90 West Street building and the World Trade Center Memorial site. Liberty Park would not be constructed until at least 2014, so a temporary location was needed to place \"The Sphere\". By February 2011, PANYNJ had not made an official final decision on where to place the sculpture once Battery Park construction commenced, requiring the sculpture to be moved, possibly into storage.\n\nAn online petition created by 9/11 families demanding the return of \"The Sphere\" to the 9/11 Memorial gained more than 7,123 signatures . Officials from the 9/11 Memorial stated that they did not want any 9/11 artifacts cluttering the 8-acre memorial plaza. On June 28, 2012, PANYNJ expressed support for the effort to move \"The Sphere\" to the plaza of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. After a public comment by Michael Burke during a meeting of the Board of Commissioners, Executive Director Patrick J. Foye stated:\n\nWhen Liberty Park opened in June 2016, the question had not been resolved. On July 22, 2016, the Port Authority voted to move the sculpture to Liberty Park, and in August 2017, PANYNJ relocated the sculpture to Liberty Park. On September 6, 2017, the Sphere was unveiled in its permanent home in Liberty Park, overlooking the World Trade Center site. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey held a ceremony at Liberty Park on November 29, 2017 to mark its return to the World Trade Center site.\n\n"}

During the course of negotiations with the Japanese, Craigie took advantage of divisions within the Japanese leadership, especially between the Prime Minister, Hiranuma Kiichirō, who wished for a greater degree of control over the military, and the military itself, which wanted less civilian control.\n\nIn July 1939, Craigie took part in negotiations with Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs Hachiro Arita, leading to the acceptance of the Craigie–Arita formula by which the British government agreed not to resist Japanese actions in China but did not recognize their legality. In July 1940, following the arrest of several British nationals in Japan, he suggested to the British government to arrest some Japanese nationals in British territory against whom a case could be made in court as a move to prove Japanese subversive intentions against Britain. \n\nOn the morning of 8 December 1941, he received from Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigenori Togo an official document, stating that negotiations with the US government had failed, but without mentioning any war between the Japanese and the British governments. \n\nAs one of the Allied diplomats interned in Japan until agreement was reached for their repatriation, he observed the Doolittle Raid on 18 April 1942. Initial reports said that it was a \"practice raid\" but one staff member (Pleasant) was sure from the start that it was a real raid, and won several bets from sceptics. Craigie said that Japanese staff had been amused at the embassy’s air raid precautions as the idea of an attack on Tokyo was \"laughable\" with the allies in retreat, but the guards now showed \"considerable excitement and perturbation.\" Several false alarms followed, and in poorer districts people rushed into the streets shouting and gesticulating, losing their normal \"iron control\" over their emotions and showing a \"tendency to panic\". The police guards on allied and neutral missions were doubled to foil xenophobic attacks; but the guard on the German mission was \"tripled\"! \n\nOn 30 July 1942, Craigie and staff left Japan on board the \"Tatsuta Maru\", returning to Britain via Lourenço Marques in East Africa (today Maputo, Mozambique).\n\nAfter returning to Britain in 1942, Craigie suggested that a more conciliatory policy towards the Japanese government would have postponed the outbreak of war in the Far East, and would have allowed the British government more time to prepare for such a war.\n\nIn 1945 served briefly as the chairman of the United Nations War Crimes Commission.\n\nIn a statistical overview derived from writings by and about Robert Craigie, OCLC/WorldCat encompasses roughly 8 works in 10+ publications in 1 language and 200+ library holdings.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2270833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270833", "title": "Xingshi Yinyuan Zhuan", "text": "Xingshi Yinyuan Zhuan\n\nThe Xingshi Yinyuan Zhuan (), also translated as Marriage Destinies to Awaken the World, Tale of Marriage Destinies That Will Bring Society to Its Senses and A Romance to Awaken the World, is a Chinese classical novel of the late Ming or early Qing dynasty. One recent scholar calls it \"one of China's most underrated traditional vernacular novels\", a saga of two families, one a reincarnation of the other, whose \"catalog of vices and moral decay conjures up the apocalyptic vision of a doomed nation\".\n\nOriginally named \"E Yinyuan\" (惡姻緣, \"A Cursed Marital Fate\"), the novel takes the Buddhist doctrine of karma and vipāka as its basic motif.\n\nThe novel was published under the pen name Xizhou Sheng (西周生), that is, \"Scholar of the Western Zhou\", the Golden Age in which Confucius lived. Hu Shih's confident announcement in 1931 of his discovery that it was written by Pu Songling has been \"largely discredited\". Nothing about the author is known, though authorship has been \"wrongly\" attributed to Pu on the grounds that the novel contains many phrases from the Shandong dialect, as does \"Jin Ping Mei\" (indeed \"Jin Ping Mei\" is quoted in the novel).\n\nThe date of composition lies between 1618 and 1681, placing it either in the late Ming or early Qing dynasty. It shares structural features and techniques with the Four Classic Ming Novels, such as the 100-chapter paradigmatic length, which is broken down into ten-chapter units, often punctuated with climactic or prophetic episodes in the ninth and tenth chapters. Other shared features are the careful use of prefiguring and recurrence, use of the devices of oral literature, and highly expressive colloquial style. The author uses crude sexual and scatological expressions, but the scenes of actual sex are comparatively restrained (\"As for what transpired after the lamp was blown out, you can use your imagination – there's no need to go into details\").\n\nThe plot is split between the two incarnations of a married couple. The victim of earlier wickedness will seek retribution by being a tormenting wife in the later reincarnation. In the first, set in the Han dynasty, the lascivious actions of Chao Yuan dissipate his family fortune in reckless living and tortures his father and wife until he is murdered. Retribution for his actions is visited upon his reincarnation, Di Xichen, in the early Ming dynasty, who after failing as a scholar becomes a prosperous merchant and is tormented by two shrewish wives, Sujie and Jijie. Xichen suffers for Chao Yuan's crimes. In the final chapters, Xichen is saved from certain death by a monk. He then vows to abstain from killing, chants the Diamond Sutra, and leads a virtuous life with one of his wives until he dies at the age of 85.\n\nThe author paints this serious family drama against a satirical panorama not only of officials, scholars, and teachers, for whom he has little respect, but cooks, midwives, and doctors. All provide examples of lechery, drunkenness, and love of money, yet each of the characters is given individual personality and particular language. The author makes precise use of proverbs, xiehouyu, and curses in the Shandong style, but also literary poetry, fiction, and writings. One of the author’s techniques is to pair one character against another of the same profession or type. Xichen is made to seem all the more inept, for instance, in contrast to his capable assistant, and his wives all the more ill-tempered in contrast with better women.\n\nThe intricate plot and didactic structure are centered on the Buddhist themes of rebirth, karmic retribution, and compassion but also on Confucian precepts of morality, hierarchy, and duty in society. By setting the action in the early Ming, between the 1440s and the 1490s, a time which seemed almost utopian, the author can dramatize the following breakdown of social order, with Heaven sending a destructive flood as a warning. The gross violation of Confucian concepts of propriety applies not only to the relations between man and wife, or between children and their parents and teachers, but is also extended to the other phases of the \"five cardinal relationships\" as well. The disorder in the family is linked to the Tumu Crisis of 1449, an actual historical incident in which Mongols captured the Emperor. The inversion of proper principles in the family echoes the proverbial \"muddleheaded sovereign\" (hun-zhun) of a dynasty going to ruin.\n\nYet Xichen's final awakening also leaves the reader room for hope. In the second plot, ostensibly set in the early Ming dynasty, the author is especially concerned with transgressions against social hierarchy, whether within marriage, such as the wife dominating the husband, or in society at large, such as transgression of social class boundaries, and presents the literate elite as weak and selfish.\n\nThe novel received relatively little attention from critics in China until the campaign for Vernacular Chinese during the May Fourth Movement in the early 20th century. Hu Shih and Xu Zhimo hailed its verbal vigor and vaunted its graphic descriptions of contemporary social life as a source-book for the study of popular culture, social, economic, and institutional history of its time. Hu Shih complained, however, that the book \"is about a million words in length. Throughout these million words on a most unhappy marriage, no one seemed to think of resorting to divorce as a solution\", for \"Chinese religion, morals, and social usage all conspired to make divorce impossible\". Literary studies of the novel in China did not become frequent until the 1980s, when scholarly editions appeared both in Taiwan and on the mainland.\n\n\n"}

She later on made a cameo appearance in \"Mano Po 2\" in 2003 and starred in the teen-oriented movie \"Kuya\" in 2004 as well as in the comedy film \"Singles\". Also, she starred in the drama film \"\" and in the horror film \"Sigaw\" which were both entries to the 2004 Metro Manila Film Festival.\n\nIn 2005, Locsin with Richard Gutierrez starred in the romantic film \"Let the Love Begin\", released under GMA Films. She and Gutierrez also reprised their roles as Alwina and Aguiluz in of the TV series \"Mulawin\", which was an entry to the 2005 Metro Manila Film Festival.\n\nEarly in 2006, Locsin starred in the romantic movie \"I Will Always Love You\". She also starred in the horror film \"TxT\" and in the romantic drama-comedy film \"\". The latter was an entry to the 2006 Metro Manila Film Festival.\n\nLocsin reunited with Gutierrez in the romantic drama film \"The Promise\" in 2007 where their roles were considered more mature than the previous films they both starred in. She had also produced her own film entitled \"Angels\", which was shown in theaters on April 2007.\n\nIn 2009, she starred in the movie \"Love Me Again\" together with Piolo Pascual in the lead titles and made a cameo in the romantic comedy film, My Amnesia Girl in 2010.\n\nLocsin gained critical acclaim in her 2011 drama film with Aga Muhlach, \"In the Name of Love\". Her performance garnered her several accolades including the Star Award for Movies for Movie Actress of the Year, the Gawad PASADO Award for Pinakapasadong Aktres, and a nomination for best actress at the FAMAS Awards.\n\nShe reunited with John Lloyd Cruz in the romantic comedy film \"Unofficially Yours\" in 2012 and then starred, together with Dingdong Dantes and Angelica Panganiban in the drama film \"One More Try\", Star Cinema's entry to the 2012 Metro Manila Film Festival. Locsin's performance in the latter was highly praised by film critics and media personalities and earned her the Star Award for Movies for Movie Actress of the Year for the second year in a row, the FAMAS Award for Best Actress and the Film Academy of the Philippines Award for Best Actress.\n\nIn 2016, she was awarded by both mainstream and indie film enthusiasts as she received #LifePeg or Lifetime Achievement Award from Star Cinema and Aktres ng Dekada Award from Inding- Indie Awards.

She also had an LGBT- themed movie The Third Party in which she play the title role. She is set to star in a Star Cinema movie entitled \"Wife, Husband, Wife\" and this will be her reunion movie with Richard Gutierrez and Angelica Panganiban.\n\nLocsin is known for being one of the Philippines' most prominent philantrophist actresses, earning her international recognition such as being one of Forbes Magazine's \"Asian Heroes of Philanthrophy\" in 2019. Forbes reported that Locsin had donated \"as much as 15 million pesos to causes such as educational scholarships for students, supporting the economic and political rights of indigenous people, and ending violence against women and children\" in just the decade from 2009 to 2019.\n\nOn April 23, 2007, Locsin celebrated her birthday with GABRIELA Foundation, an NGO that supports women and children. On April 20, 2008, Locsin organized a gift-giving to the less fortunate children in Payatas, Quezon City and gave poor children food, clothing and other basic needs. It was her birthday gift supported by her sponsors.\n\nIn her own private capacity, Locsin played an active role in raising funds and providing medical equipment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines. She raised almost P11 million to help the Philippines' medical frontliners from March to April 2020. She also helped provide sleeping tents for these frontliners and teamed up with friends and colleagues to put up the <nowiki>#UniTentWeStandPH</nowiki> campaign, raising a total of a total of P10,956,702.98 to help more than 28 hospitals put up specialized tents for COVID-19 patients. Locsin also helped fund and distribute personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical supplies to medical frontliners in Philippines' National Capital Region and nearby provinces.\n\nOn May 18, 2020, Locsin questioned the announcement of Duterte administration spokesperson Harry Roque that the government did not have a program to conduct \"mass testing\" and instead expected the private sector to undertake the task, saying on twitter that she could not believe the government had not prepared for mass testing, which was very urgently needed. The following day, she and actress friend Anne Curtis announced that they were reviving a 2009 fundraising initiative which they had originally set up for victims of Typhoon Ondoy. This time, She and Curtis would be raising funds for the purchase of COVID-19 test kits. They said that they were doing so to support mass testing, saying \"\"Because in this way we can make a higher impact, by pushing the TEST-TRACE-ISOLATE/TREAT formula that is the only proven way to defeat the virus.\"\"\n\nShe has also chosen to acknowledge the important service of local officials, however, noting that by providing their constituents with vital assistance, they were often \"risking their lives as well.\"\n\nLocsin has spoken out numerous times against the practice of red-tagging, in which critics of the government are harassed by being accused as “communists” even if they don't actually share such beliefs or affiliations. She has even been a victim of this herself, calling on the National Bureau of Investigation to look into red-tagging and \"death threats\" aimed at her through social media in March 2020.\n\nIn response to the ABS-CBN franchise renewal controversy, Locsin expressed her support for the network, saying that she was \"praying that the law shall be used to protect jobs, press freedom, justice and betterment of the Filipino people.\"\n\nOn June 29, 2019, Locsin announced in an Instagram post about her engagement to her boyfriend, movie producer Neil Arce.\n\nAngel Locsin is a Filipina television and film actress, commercial model, film producer and fashion designer.

Their parents are Leslie (Diamond) and Charles Lowenstein. The duo were raised in an Orthodox Jewish family, and attended Greenfield Hebrew Academy and Yeshiva High School (which have since merged to form the Atlanta Jewish Academy). Through their mother, they are related (by marriage) to actor Logan Lerman. They began performing in the folk-pop genre in coffee houses in their hometown of Atlanta, Georgia. In 1994, their live album, \"Live at KaLo's Coffee House\", was released, and drew some attention. After touring for a year, in 1996 they released a second independent album, \"Not from Concentrate\" and performed at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. While touring they were noticed by Jimmy Buffett, who signed them to Island Records, the label on which they released \"We've Never Heard Of You, Either\" in 1998.

More recently it is an alternative to factory farming or more broadly, intensive agriculture or unsustainable farming methods that are prevalent in primarily first world countries. \"Environmental Health Perspectives\" has noted that \"Sustainable agriculture is not merely a package of prescribed methods. More important, it is a change in mind set whereby agriculture acknowledges its dependence on a finite natural resource base--including the finite quality of fossil fuel energy that is now a critical component of conventional farming systems.\" \n\nSmall-scale agriculture includes a number of sustainable agriculture practices such as:\n\nThe methods of food sustainability and economics are hotly debated. This is a question between agricultural economics and the draining of the largely unaccounted natural capital.\n\nSmall farms have many economic advantages. Local farmers generate a local economy in their rural communities. An American study showed that small farms with incomes of $100,000 or less spend almost 95 percent of their farm-related expenses within their local communities. The same study took in comparison the fact that farms with incomes greater than $900,000 spend less than 20 percent of their farm-related expenses in the local economy. Thus, small-scale agriculture supports local economy.\n\nAgricultural productivity is variously measured, and large-scale farming is often less efficient than small sustainable farms. Industrial single crop creates a high output per worker whilst, small-scale farmers produce more food per acre of land.\n\nSmall-scale agriculture often sell products directly to the consumers. Disintermediation gives the farmer the profit that would otherwise go to the wholesaler, the distributor and the supermarket. About two thirds of the selling price would actually be lost for product marketing. Meanwhile, if farmers sell their products directly to consumers, they recover the totality of their product value.\n\n"}

It was previously called Ahmanson Ranch Park. It sustained severe damage during the Woolsey Fire of 2018.\n\nFor thousands of years the Chumash Native American tribe lived in the current Preserve's area. The Chumash had, prior to European involvement, at least one village on the land, Huwam, a multi-cultural village where Chumash, Tongva, and Tataviam peoples lived. On Bell Creek beside Escorpión Peak (Castle Peak) a large rocky mountain on the property of El Escorpion Park, is the reported site of this village. The peak is one of nine alignment points in Chumash territory and is essential to maintaining the balance of the natural world. A cave known as \"The Cave of Munits\" exists just inside the property. This is the believed cave of a mythical Chumash shaman who was killed after murdering the son of a Chumash chief. This cave also appeared in the films \"The Canyon of Missing Men\" (1930) and \"Tarzan and the Golden Lion\" (1927).\n\nThe 1769 Juan Bautista de Anza expedition, the first European exploration by land of Las Californias, passed by the area. The U.S. National Park service's Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail goes through the Preserve, entering in Moore Canyon from El Escorpion Park and Vanowen Street. The Rancho El Escorpión was an 1845 Mexican land grant named after the Peak, and was adjacent on the northeast side of the Preserve. From the 1920s to the 1950s many Westerns and other types of motion pictures were filmed here at the Laskey Mesa movie ranch area.\n\nIn 1963, Home Savings of America obtained the property that was then called Ahmanson Ranch. It sat unused, with no plans for development, until 1989 when Home Savings of America announced their plans for the property. The plans included over 3,000 homes, two golf courses, and of commercial and residential space. However, in 1998, Home Savings of America was bought by Washington Mutual for $6.4 billion. In 2003 the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy purchased the land from WAMU for an open space preserve and nature reserve Park.\n\nOn September 28, 2005, the Topanga Canyon Fire broke out between the west-bound State Route 118 and Topanga Canyon Boulevard. By September 29, the fire had reached the Preserve, and burned a large portion of the park near, and including, El Escorpion Park. By October 3, 2005, the fire had been contained. A total of were burned, and it cost over $8 million to contain and extinguish the fire. The effects of the fire were visible in the park, as much of the chaparral and grasslands were burned away, and Oak tree canopies burned off. Since the California native plants have evolved with wildfires, from their basel roots, seeds, and branches they re-sprouted the following fall and winter exhibiting an amazing new growth by the next spring.\n\nThere are two preserve trailheads at which people can access the park.\n\nLocated at the western end of Victory Blvd. in West Hills, the Victory Trailhead is the main trailhead for the Preserve. It features a large gravel parking lot with a Portable Toilet that is cleaned at least weekly. The parking lot has room for buses and equestrian trailers. Parking is $3 for the day. Parking passes are available through The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy website. Multi-park 5- and 7-day and single park 7-day passes are available. Parking is also available \"outside\" the park gates on Victory Blvd., Gilmore St., and Country Oak Rd. A bulletin board featuring information on the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and recent park and system information is located in the parking lot. There are two picnic tables just inside the park and a large informational display featuring the history, geography, and wildlife of the Preserve.\n\nThis trailhead is located west of Calabasas and north of the Ventura Freeway (U.S. Route 101) on Las Virgenes Canyon Road, at the end of the road. Parking is provided, with a large informational display featuring the history, geography, and wildlife of the Preserve.\nThere are several primary trails through which people can access the park. \n\nThese trails are available for walking, hiking, mountain biking, and equestrian use during the hours of daylight (sunrise to sunset), 7 days a week. Evening access is permitted for park scheduled event participants only. Unauthorized motor vehicles and motorbikes are not permitted.\n\nVisitors should bring basic supplies when exploring the Preserve. For example: two hikers needed to be rescued by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department in 2007 after becoming lost while on the trails and paths. Although experienced hikers, and being well-equipped for the hike, the two veered off a path that had been obscured by recent fires and were unable to find their way back to a trail. One was suffering from hypothermia so the other used a cell phone to call 911, and they were rescued later that day. Guided walks, hikes, and evening programs are offered in the park by the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.\n\nDogs on 6-foot leashes under the immediate control of the owner are allowed on the designated trails.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2270895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270895", "title": "Soleus muscle", "text": "Soleus muscle\n\nIn humans and some other mammals, the soleus is a powerful muscle in the back part of the lower leg (the calf). It runs from just below the knee to the heel, and is involved in standing and walking. It is closely connected to the gastrocnemius muscle and some anatomists consider them to be a single muscle, the triceps surae. Its name is derived from the Latin word \"solea\", meaning \"sandal\".\n\nThe soleus is located in the superficial posterior compartment of the leg. \n\nThe soleus exhibits significant morphological differences across species. It is unipennate in many species. In some animals, such as the rabbit, it is fused for much of its length with the gastrocnemius muscle.\n\nIn the human, soleus is a complex multi-pennate muscle, usually having a separate (posterior) aponeurosis from the gastrocnemius muscle. A majority of soleus muscle fibers originate from each side of the anterior aponeurosis, attached to the tibia and fibula. Other fibers originate from the posterior (back) surfaces of the head of the fibula and its upper quarter, as well as the middle third of the medial border of the tibia.\n\nThe fibers originating from the anterior surface of the anterior aponeurosis insert onto the median septum and the fibers originating from the posterior surface of the anterior aponeurosis insert onto the posterior aponeurosis. The posterior aponeurosis and median septum join in the lower quarter of the muscle and then join with the anterior aponeuroses of the gastrocnemius muscles to form the calcaneal tendon or Achilles tendon and inserts onto the posterior surface of the calcaneus, or heel bone.\n\nIn contrast to some animals, the human soleus and gastrocnemius muscles are relatively separate, such that shear can be detected between the soleus and gastrocnemius aponeuroses.\n\nThe Soleus is vestigial in the horse.\n\nThe gastrocnemius muscle is superficial to (closer to the skin than) the soleus, which lies below the gastrocnemius.\n\nThe plantaris muscle and a portion of its tendon run between the two muscles. Deep to it (farther from the skin) is the transverse intermuscular septum, which separates the superficial posterior compartment of the leg from the deep posterior compartment.\n\nOn the other side of the fascia are the tibialis posterior muscle, the flexor digitorum longus muscle, and the flexor hallucis longus muscle, along with the posterior tibial artery and posterior tibial vein and the tibial nerve.\n\nSince the anterior compartment of the leg is lateral to the tibia, the bulge of muscle medial to the tibia on the anterior side is actually the posterior compartment. The soleus is superficial middle of the tibia.\n\nThe action of the calf muscles, including the soleus, is plantarflexion of the foot (that is, they increase the angle between the foot and the leg). They are powerful muscles and are vital in walking, running, and keeping balance. The soleus specifically plays an important role in maintaining standing posture; if not for its constant pull, the body would fall forward.\n\nAlso, in upright posture, the soleus is responsible for pumping \"venous\" blood back into the heart from the periphery, and is often called the skeletal-muscle pump, \"peripheral heart\" or the \"sural (tricipital) pump\".\n\nSoleus muscles have a higher proportion of slow muscle fibers than many other muscles. In some animals, such as the guinea pig and cat, soleus consists of 100% slow muscle fibers. Human soleus fiber composition is quite variable, containing between 60 and 100% slow fibers.\n\nThe soleus is the most effective muscle for plantarflexion in a bent knee position (Hence called the first gear muscle). This is because the gastrocnemius originates on the femur, so bending the leg limits its effective tension. During regular movement (i.e., walking) the soleus is the primary muscle utilized for plantarflexion due to the slowtwitch fibers resisting fatigue.\n\nDue to the thick fascia covering the muscles of the leg, they are prone to compartment syndrome. This pathology relates to the inflammation of tissue affecting blood flow and compressing nerves. If left untreated compartment syndrome can lead to atrophy of muscles, blood clots, and neuropathy.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2270901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270901", "title": "Dual-control modes of ventilation", "text": "Dual-control modes of ventilation\n\nDual-control modes of ventilation are auto-regulated pressure-controlled modes of mechanical ventilation with a user-selected tidal volume target. The ventilator adjusts the pressure limit of the next breath as necessary according to the previous breath's measured exhaled tidal volume. Peak airway pressure varies from breath to breath according to changes in the patient's airway resistance and lung compliance.\n\nThe pressure waveform is square, and the flow waveform is decelerating. This mode is a form of continuous mandatory ventilation as a minimum number of passive breaths will be time-triggered, and patient-initiated breaths are time-cycled and regulated according to operator-set tidal volume.\n\nThe first few breaths are delivered to the patient according to the ventilator manufacturer's particular algorithm for determining the patient's resistance and compliance. These are 'test breaths' that the ventilator can then use to calculate the optimal pressures for the next, regulated breaths. The pressure is constant during the set inspiratory time as with pressure-controlled CMV. The ventilator will use the exhaled tidal volume measured at the end of that breath's expiratory phase to calculate the pressure of the next breath. If the exhaled tidal volume is lower than the software threshold, the next breath will be delivered at a higher pressure, and if the exhaled tidal volume is higher than the software threshold, the next breath will be delivered at a lower pressure.\n\nThe theory is to ensure that the lowest inspiratory pressure necessary to achieve the desired tidal volume is used. As a safety feature, the ventilator will not increase the pressure beyond a predetermined high pressure limit. This is usually tied to (but not the same as) the operator-set high pressure alarm setting. If the ventilator delivers a breath at this high pressure limit and is still unable to achieve the operator-desired exhaled tidal volume, an alarm will sound to warn the operator that the volume target cannot be met.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2270906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270906", "title": "Tranquility (video game)", "text": "Tranquility (video game)\n\ntranquility is a nonviolent musical platform game created in 1991 for Macintosh and Windows computers by musician William A. Romanowski. The game features generative algorithms that determine music and level layout based on the player's actions. For this reason, and due to its use of generated ambient music, the game's philosophy has been compared to that of Transcendentalism and the New Age Movement. According to the game's publishers, some players have reported immersion in the game to produce a dream-like experience during and after play. The game notably appeared first as a demo included with Silicon Graphics computers. It was updated and re-released by its designer as a commercial game 10 years later in 2001. This version of the game was supported for 10 years but a notice that the game was to be retired appeared on the website in 2010. As of now, the site is inaccessible.\n\nIn \"tranquility\", the player (from an abstract, first-person viewpoint) floats in a sea of starlit geometric structures called \"platforms\" in order to pass through targets called \"spinners\" (camouflaged star-shaped objects scattered at a density of one per room). The game's challenge is derived from the difficulty in locating the variously-placed \"spinners\" and as such the game may be compared to hide-and-seek. Level progression is nonlinear, and the game is intended to be self-paced, and self-directed. A number of in-game options allow players to control game speed and difficulty, including an auto-pilot button.\n\nAdvancement through the game is accomplished by finding each spinner in all 3,087 rooms. Progression through the hierarchy of \"realms,\" \"ranks,\" \"sets of rooms,\" and \"rooms\" results in incrementation of the player's \"level.\" Thus, there are 21 realms in total, 7 ranks per realm (for a total of 147 realms), 3 sets of rooms per rank (for a total of 441 sets of rooms), and 7 rooms per set of rooms (for the full total of 3,087 rooms). Each room contains 1 spinner.\n\nCompleting each rank advances the player by 1 level, making for a total of 147 levels. Each rank and realm adds subtle complexity to game play by interactively evolving to correspond with the player's actions. This acts to enhance replay value, and provides for lengthier play experience.\n\nThe essential elements that define a \"tranquility\" room are:\n\nDesigned by musician, William A. Romanowski, the musical aspects of the game are notable in that they are generated using algorithms designed to respond to the player's interactions with the interface. The game's AI algorithms were initially developed using the Nord Modular Synthesizer, with those concepts applied to the game's music and graphics generation systems. The music engine creates unique, arrhythmic musical compositions for each player's levels, providing an immersive, sensual environment. In this way the game can be compared to generative music games \"Rez\", and \"Otocky\". In addition to normal play modes, \"tranquility\" includes a simple level editor and a jukebox mode for enjoying the game's generated music.\n\nThe structure of the rooms in \"tranquility\" also react to the player's style of level-completion evolutionarily. As such, the game allows self-adjusting ad hoc difficulty similar to enemy progression in the space shooter, \"Warning Forever\". The generative nature of the musical score as well as the room structure mean that the game will provide a gaming experience uniquely tailored to the strengths and weaknesses of the individual player, and different experiences can be gained by altering playing style. This interactive variability directly counteracts the degree of tedium normally associated with progression through 3,087 rooms, while also relieving the developer from the task of creating thousands of levels manually, an approach also used in No Man's Sky.\n"}

Led by founding publisher Marvin Scott Jarrett, art director David Carson and executive editor Randy Bookasta, along with founding editor Neil Feineman. \"Ray Gun\" explored experimental magazine typographic design and unique angles on the pop cultural currents of the 1990s. The editorial content was framed in a chaotic, abstract style, not always readable (it once published an interview with Bryan Ferry entirely in the symbol font Zapf Dingbats), but distinctive in appearance. That visual tradition continued even after Carson left the magazine after three years; he was followed by a series of art directors, including Robert Hales, Chris Ashworth, Jason Saunby, Scott Denton-Cardew, and Jerome Curchod.\n\nIn terms of content, \"Ray Gun\" was also notable for its choices of subject matter. The advertising, musical artists and pop culture icons spotlighted were progressive—for example putting such artists as Radiohead, Björk, Beck, Flaming Lips, PJ Harvey and Eminem on its cover before its competitors. Those choices were guided by Executive Editor Randy Bookasta (and founding editor Neil Feineman for the first three issues), along with an editorial staff that included Dean Kuipers, Nina Malkin, Mark Blackwell, Joe Donnelly, Grant Alden, Mark Woodlief, and Eric Gladstone.\n\n\"Ray Gun\" produced over 70 issues from 1992 through 2000. Owner-founder-publisher Marvin Scott Jarrett (one-time publisher of a late-1980s incarnation of \"Creem\") also later created the magazines \"Stick\", \"huH\", \"Bikini\", and \"Nylon\" (a New York–based fashion magazine). The most notable common thread among all of Jarrett's magazines (from his days at \"Creem\" through \"Nylon\") have been their focus on graphic design and music.\n\n\n\n"}

Analysis of this patch by the infrared telescope Herschel (October 9, 2009), which has the capability of penetrating such dense cloud material, resulted in continued black space. This led to the belief that either the cloud material was immensely dense or that an unexplained phenomenon had been detected. \n\nWith support from ground-based observations done using the submillimeter bolometer cameras on the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment radio telescope (November 29, 2009) and the Mayall (Kitt Peak) and Magellan telescopes (December 4, 2009), it was determined that the patch looks black not because it is an extremely dense pocket of gas, but because it is truly empty. The exact cause of this phenomenon is still being investigated, although it has been hypothesized that narrow jets of gas from some of the young stars in the region punctured the sheet of dust and gas, as well as, powerful radiation from a nearby mature star may have helped to create the hole.

The first tour was held in October 1952 as a six-day event. It is now held annually over five days in February. It is named after the \"Herald Sun\", Melbourne's only daily tabloid newspaper. It was originally known as the Sun Tour after \"The Sun News-Pictorial\", and changed its name when \"The Sun News-Pictorial\" merged with \"The Herald\" in 1990.\n\nIn 1952 the first general classification winner was Keith Rowley, a Maffra sheep farmer, in a time of 42 h 57 min 55 s. The first King of the Mountain and Sprint champion was Jack (John) McDonough from Coburg.\n\nAustralian cyclists dominated the first 30 editions of the race, before its status rose and began attracting overseas stars. By the year 2000, the race had shifted to October and Australia's cyclists racing in Europe began to compete in the race. The resulting rise in the event's standard saw the race become rated by the UCI for the first time in 2005.\nSeveral notable Australian cyclists have won the General classification including Stuart O'Grady in 2008, Baden Cooke in 2002, Neil Stephens in 1986, and Russell Mockridge in 1957.\n\nThe 2004 race was conducted from 14 to 24 October 2004 and involved 85 cyclists in seventeen teams of five. Thirteen stages were completed with a total distance of 1110.7 km, 119 intermediate sprints and 37 hill climbs, including the two category one climbs of Mount Baw Baw and in the Otway Ranges.

Karl Menzies won the sprint classification and Phillip Thuaux won the Mountains classification.\n\nAfter the 2009 race, the organisers of the Herald Sun Tour proposed moving the race from its traditional October date to February, with no edition in 2010. Cycling Australia approved the move, but in the face of opposition from the UCI, the plans never came to fruition. In the end, the 2010 race was \"held over\" due to the 2010 UCI Road World Championships being held in Geelong and Melbourne, and the race returned to the calendar in October 2011. The UCI accepted a change of date the following year, with a January 2013 date instead of October 2012, but downgraded the race from 2.1 to a National Event, preventing most professional teams from across the world from taking part.\n\nThe next edition of the Tour was held from 5–9 February 2014, and regained a UCI 2.1 ranking, permitting top level trade teams to again compete. Due to numerous bushfires across Victoria the last stage of the race was cancelled, with rider Simon Clarke declared the winner.\n\nThe 63rd edition of the Tour got a huge profile boost when reigning Tour de France champion Chris Froome of confirmed he would be starting his 2016 season at the event, having previously participated in 2008 with the Barloworld team where he finished 4th overall.

Dance exhibitions and variety shows designed to attract tourists replaced prostitution as the chief business of the area. Many of the dance crazes that swept America during the 1900s and 1910s originated in this section of San Francisco. The Thalia, the largest and most popular dance hall on the Pacific coast, was the birthplace of the Texas Tommy. (\"Tommy\" was a slang term for prostitute.)\n\nAround 1910, the Texas Tommy was a hit at a lowlife hot spot called Purcell's, a Negro cabaret, but it became respectable when it was danced at the upscale Fairmont Hotel, the most popular venue for ballroom dancing in San Francisco. Who invented the Texas Tommy is obscure. Most likely the signature moves of the dance were being performed by patrons at Purcell's, and some innovative visitor adapted them for the ballroom floor. Some historians say that Johnny Peters, an African American, developed the Texas Tommy some time before 1910. In any event, after sheet music for \"The Texas Tommy Swing\" was published on 1 February 1911, the Fairmont's house band frequently played the song for its patrons. It was not long before the Texas Tommy was danced on Broadway, in \"Ziegfeld Follies of 1911\", performed by Vera Maxwell, Harry Watson Jr., and the ensemble. It was also included as a number in \"Darktown Follies\", an all-black musical produced Off-Broadway in 1913. Peters and Ethel Williams, who were masters of the dance, executed it on stage, as they had done regularly at the Fairmont.\n\nSome social dance historians have argued that the Texas Tommy was the first swing dance. The argument is that it was the first social dance using the basic 8-count rhythm of swing dance to include a breakaway step from the closed position of other couple dances of the time. Ethel Williams, who helped to popularize the dance in New York in 1913, described it as a \"kick and a hop three times on each foot followed by a slide.\" The basic steps are followed by a breakaway, an open position that allowed for acrobatics, antics, improvisations, and showing off. Working from an old film of the dance, she also described it as having a basic pattern of \"a loose step, hop-kick, step, hop-kick, run, run, run, run\" and identified a \"useful variation\" of four step-kicks that \"agrees with the open and improvisational manner that the Texas Tommy was described to have in many of the written references.\"\n\nOne reviewer of the Texas Tommy number in \"Ziegfeld Follies of 1911\" described the dance in these words: \"The Texas Tommy dancers are perhaps more acrobatic than eccentric . . . the whirl which spins his partner towards the footlights with such momentum that without aid she must assuredly fly across them must be nicely adjusted so that in neither force nor direction shall she escape the restraining grasp of his hand outstretched just at the right moment to arrest her.\" A more modern writer put it in simpler terms, saying that it was \"a whirling couple dance with a momentum that nearly catapulted the female partner across the orchestra pit.\" Texas Tommy was later used to name a typical swingout dance move that was a characteristic of the Lindy Hop in the 1930s.\n\nThe \"Texas Tommy Swing\" was composed by Sid Brown, with lyrics by Val Harris, and was published by the World's Fair Publishing Company in San Francisco in January or February 1911. The sheet music cover was designed in the form of the front page of a newspaper, with the headline reading \"The Dance That Makes the Whole World Stare.\" The faux newspaper included reprints of three articles from the \"San Francisco Examiner\", headlined \"Pavlowa Endorsed Texas Tommy Swing,\" \"Mrs. Oelriches Liked Texas Tommy Swing,\" and \"The Story of the Dance,\" which is transcribed here:\nA breath from the cotton fields - the grizzly bear, the loving hug, the walk-back and the turkey-trot all blend in Texas Tommy Swing.\n\nThe Texas Tommy Swing invades the north and east like a dainty zephyr from the perfumed cotton fields of the sunny South. The rhythm of the Grizzy Bear, the inspiration of the Loving Hug, the grace of the Walk-Back and the abandon of the Turkey-Trot all belend in the harmony of the Texas Tommy Swing, which was really the parent of all the others.\n\nThe dance originated more than forty years ago among the negroes of the old Southern plantations. Every little movement has a meaning all its own to the heart truly in tune with nature. The graceful harmonies of the song and dance reflect the joyous spirit of the negro race, the care-free actions of the Dinahs and the Sams who gathered outside the cabin doors on moonlit nights and to the twang of the banjo or the scrape of the fiddle, vented the rhapsodies of mind and body in a purely natural way.\n\nHere and there a raucous discord like the squaking voice of a chicken in distress breaks in upon the frivolous melody of the theme or a plaintive note brings a reminder of the tear always so close to the laugh in the negro nature.\n\nSouthern darkies brought the dance and a suggestion of the melody to San Francisco several years ago, and there upon the Barbary Coast it was rounded into perfect harmony. It took the place by storm. Eastern people interested in dancing took it up. Stage favorites seized upon its absorbing rhapsodies.\n\nSociety men and women accepted and adopted it. Pavlowa, the Czar's favorite dancer, went into raptures over it and incorporated it in her repertoire. Leaders of the four hundred all over the country regard it as one of the sights of San Francisco and endorse it to their friends on their return.\n\nIn tangible and concrete form this inspiring, historic and dramatic song and dance is now presented to the public for the first time, in Texas Tommy Swing.\n"}

In the game the player pilots the Battle Engine for the Forseti military in their wars against the Muspell to decide who will rule what's left of the world. \"Battle Engine Aquila\" received little attention from the public despite overall good reviews from critics. It was listed as #86 in the Top 100 Games for PlayStation 2 by IGN. A later Microsoft Windows port was published by Encore Software.\n\nThe ice caps on the planet Allium have melted due to the greenhouse effect. As a result, most of planet's surface ended up underwater. Only 13 islands scattered across the surface remain and only two civilizations of Allium's human-like inhabitants are left: The peaceful and technological Forseti and the aggressive Muspell. Both civilizations are at the brink of war with each other in a battle over the remaining landmasses.\n\nThe player assumes the role of Hawk Winter, a Forseti dockworker. He is also a dock racer where he races on his loader. After one of the races Tatiana Kiralova, a friend of Hawk's and an overseer of the Aquila program, persuades colonel Chuck Kramer, the leader of the Forseti Air Force, to secretly assign Hawk to piloting the Battle Engine.\n\nThe war starts with the Muspell attack on RI-04 island close to Forseti Major, the homeland of Forseti. Aquila program R&D facilities are located there. The player wipes out the whole Muspell strike force in time to fight the rest of the war.\n\nThe Battle Engine has two modes of operation: \"Jet mode\" allows the Battle Engine to fly for a limited time, \"Walker mode\" transforms the Battle Engine into a mech-like walking tank. When the Battle Engine is in Walker Mode, its weapons are considerably stronger than when it is in Jet Mode, it is tougher but much slower.\n\nThere are, by the end, 4 different types of Battle Engine that one may choose to pilot: Pulsar, Blazer, Lancer and Sniper. There are multiple weapons that are available for the Battle Engines that can be used. The Sniper Battle Engine only has 1 airborne weapon (the others have two each), the Vulcan Cannon, but it is the only ship that can engage a stealth mode, rendering it invisible. This capability drains the energy of the Battle Engine, in a similar fashion to the Jet Mode.\n\nThe campaign provides at least 8 hours gameplay on the easiest difficulty, and each level presents you with a new threat or dilemma to tackle. There are a variety of boss - style unique enemies that play key roles on the battlefield, and a good variety of standard units to take on as well. The story's narrative and the characters within do little to enhance the game's entertainment value.\n\nThe battles themselves are notably well simulated, with beach landings, ambushes and airborne landing craft, artillery raining down from naval forces while bombers and fighters engage each other overhead.\n\nThe game also involves some strategic thinking, giving you the option of what targets to prioritize rather than giving you a specific objective. You may at any point choose to take out the enemies factories, distract their fighters, harass incoming landing craft or pick off specific targets.\n\nThe Xbox version received \"generally favorable reviews\", while the PC and PlayStation 2 versions received \"mixed or average reviews\", according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. \"Edge\" gave the PS2 and Xbox versions 7 out of 10. \"GamePro\" gave the PS2 version an average review over a month before the game's release.\n\nDespite positive critical reception, \"Battle Engine Aquila\" received poor sales. IGN ranked it as the 86th best PlayStation 2 game.\n"}

The bank, along with its two subsidiaries, declared a voluntary bank holiday for failing to meet withdrawals and was consequently closed by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas and put under the mandatory receivership of the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation on April 26, 2000. The bank subsequently merged with Export and Industry Bank (Exportbank) in 2001.\n\nUrban Bank was incorporated on July 8, 1980, as a private development bank. Sometime later that year, the bank opened as a one-branch thrift bank in what is today Pasig.\n\nIn 1981, Urban Bank was chosen by the government as one of twelve financial institutions legally permitted to trade government securities. By 1982, the bank became one of the few non-commercial banks licensed by the Bangko Sentral to accept checking accounts and accept foreign currency deposits and was also accredited by the Bureau of Internal Revenue as one of its tax collecting agents. After the BIR withdrew the authority to collect taxes from all collecting banks, Urban Bank was the first bank to be subsequently re-accredited by the BIR. By 1985, it became the largest originating bank for loans to the Pag-IBIG Fund for its National Shelter Program.\n\nIn 1987, Urban Bank became the first non-commercial bank to list on the Manila Stock Exchange and the Makati Stock Exchange (now the Philippine Stock Exchange) under the ticker symbol UBI. After its closure and subsequent merger with Export and Industry Bank, Urban Bank shares were re-listed on the PSE under Exportbank's ticker symbol, EIB.\n\nThrough its affiliate, Urbancorp Investments (UII), Urban Bank acquired in 1987 a stockbrokerage seat in the MkSE. The stockbrokerage license was subsequently transferred to Urbancorp Securities, a new subsidiary licensed to engage in securities dealership and brokerage.\n\nIn 1988, the Securities and Exchange Commission with the Bangko Sentral granted UII the license to operate as an investment house. In 1992, the Bangko Sentral granted UII the license to engage in the trust and funds management businesses.\n\nIn 1990, Urban Bank started its online computerization program and became the first non-commercial bank and the fifth bank to join the MegaLink ATM consortium. A year later, the bank was granted a license to operate as a commercial bank, and later in 1994, UBI became a universal bank, only to revert to a commercial bank in 1997.\n\nOther than becoming a universal bank in 1994, Urban Bank was also granted a licence to engage in quasi-bank operations as well. It was also in 1994 that Urban Bank was named Asia's best performing small bank by Thomson BankWatch. One of its subsidiaries, Urbancorp Realty Developers (URDI), listed on the PSE in 1996.\n\nIn 1995, Urban Bank became the first Philippine bank to issue SEC-registered asset-backed-securities. That year, it also launched its Virtual Banking Development Project, and by 1996, became the first Philippine bank to offer online banking. The Virtual Banking project was ISO 9001-certified from 1996 until the bank's closure in 2000 to meet international quality standards, making Urban Bank the first and only Philippine bank to earn this distinction. The objective of the project was to integrate banking services into an electronic platform to avoid the need for a large branch network. Later that year, Urban Bank launched a successful stock rights and public offer of its common shares, raising some 695 million pesos in fresh capital for the bank.\n\nIn 1997, Urban Bank incorporated a subsidiary, Urbancorp Development Bank (UDB), a thrift bank based in Cebu City. By 1998, owing to Urban Bank's solvency and stability, the Bangko Sentral cited UBI for its overall performance in solvency, liquidity, and management. The BSP's SLIP ratings system (which measures a bank's condition against the entire universal banking system) gave Urban Bank a score higher than the industry average, putting Urban Bank in a financial position better than most universal banks. At the time, Urban Bank was known for being one of the most solvent banks in the Philippines.\n\nLater that year, Urban Bank embarked on a comprehensive mortgage banking program to promote housing sector activity and growth. The plan was implemented to meet the needs of the Philippine mortgage market: from developmental financing, to developer receivables financing, to buyer take-out, and to eventual securitization that would be publicly listed. The bank vertically integrated itself with the investment house (Urbancorp Investments) and subsidiaries which would play vital roles in the program, which included insurance subsidiary Urbancorp Life and General Insurance and the Philippine Home Development Finance Corporation, a subsidiary formed to take care of home financing.\n\nIn early 2000, Urban Bank nearly concluded a merger with a smaller rival, Panasia Bank, only to fail after the BSP set new requirements on bank mergers. Due to this, Urban Bank set on a new strategy: to convert the bank into a public holding company. Even while becoming a holding company, Urban Bank would retain its three subsidiaries: UDB, URDI and UII. The holding company would then immediately infuse an additional equity of 1-2 billion pesos into the existing P50 million equity of UDB, thereby increasing its capital by 20-40 times, making it one of the biggest thrift banks in the country. Urban Bank's assets excluding its non-performing loans would then be transferred to UDB. The proposal was presented to the Bangko Sentral on March 9, 2000.\n\nOn April 25, 2000, Urban Bank declared a bank holiday to put a stop to the panic withdrawals that have been plaguing essentially the investment house, reaching up to 1-2 billion pesos on that day alone. Both Urban Bank and Urbancorp Investments suffered the run due to a jittery financial market at the hands of negative news that Urban Bank denies.\n\nIn the five weeks leading up the bank holiday, Urban Bank remained amazingly solvent. In those five weeks, Urban Bank and Urbancorp Investments were able to make good on three billion pesos worth of withdrawals without any assistance from the BSP or the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC), a feat that would be impossible for a financial institution of a comparable size. Even when the bank closed, Urban Bank claimed it had two billion pesos and Urbancorp Investments had 355 million pesos in liquid and non-risk assets.\n\nLess than twenty-four hours after the declaration of a voluntary bank holiday, and as a legal consequence of this, the BSP's Monetary Board ordered the summary closure of Urban Bank and Urbancorp Development Bank and the virtual closure of Urbancorp Investments. The PDIC, as a mandatory receiver of closed banks served upon UBI the closure order right after the Monetary Board met to deliberate on the voluntary bank holiday declared by Urban Bank citing the resolution number therein. The board decided based on previous meetings with the senior officers of the bank and the failed attempt to secure a \"white knight\" and in light of three supervision and examination sector (SES) reports submitted to it by the Bangko Sentral. Urban Bank claims that the three SES reports submitted were false. Eventually the Supreme Court dismissed all the cases filed by the officers of Urban Bank and found the closure in order.\n\nHowever, the fight to keep the bank open ultimately failed as the existing shareholders could not put up the minimum capital required to continue the bank. Urban Bank and Urbancorp Development Bank were ordered closed under Section 30(a) of Republic Act No. 7653, the New Central Bank Act. In the 52-year history of the Bangko Sentral (under both the old and New Central Bank Acts), Urban Bank and Urbancorp Development Bank were the only banks, according to Urban Bank, ever ordered closed for reasons of illiquidity. UBI remains one of the largest, if not the largest, bank in Philippine banking history to have been ordered closed. However, UBI asserts that the BSP \"even risked perjury before the Ombudsman to conceal this fact\", that it was one of the biggest, if not the biggest, banks ever ordered closed for mere illiquidity and that, according to Urban Bank, was a very stable bank with a very good (or excellent) track record.\n\nAfter failed merger negotiations with the Bank of Commerce, in August 2001 Urban Bank shareholders approved a merger of Urban Bank and Urbancorp Investments with Export and Industry Bank (Exportbank) that left Exportbank as the surviving entity.\n\nUrban Bank was divided into the following subsidiaries and affiliates:\n\n\nWhile Urban Bank was closed on the basis of illiquidity, its officers were accused of having a hand in the closure, through accusations from the BSP and the PDIC against thirteen Urban Bank officers and employees, including Teodoro Borlongan. With the BSP and the PDIC acting as complainants, they filed a total of five criminal complaints before the Philippine Department of Justice, from June 26 until November 15, 2000. Four of the complaints were for alleged estafa while two were related to economic sabotage. All charges were filed after the closure of Urban Bank.\n\nFor more information on many of the cases filed by Borlongan, see: NSP.gov.ph. Most of the information below is from this page at UrbanBank.info on the BSP charges.\n\nInvestigation Slip No. 1217 was filed by the Bangko Sentral and the PDIC against Francisco Eizmendi, former president of San Miguel Corporation and a director of Urban Bank, for alleged estafa surrounding the partial pretermination of a five million-peso deposit he made with UBI.\n\nThe I.S. was first filed as Criminal Case No. 01-081 at the Makati City Regional Trial Court Branch 133 on June 26, 2000, then refiled as Criminal Case No. 02-2704 at Makati City RTC Branch 64, only to be re-ordered back to Branch 133. The case was eventually reassigned to Makati City RTC Branch 149. The case, heard by Judge Napoleon Inoturan, was refiled in 2002 and eventually heard by Judge Delia Panganiban.\n\nJudge Inoturan decided the case in favor of defendant Eizmendi and chided the DOJ for filing the case, especially because Inoturan found that not one of the four required elements of estafa was alleged or found in the crime. It also deemed Eizmendi in \"good faith\". The prosecution did not challenge the verdict. Instead, on October 3, 2002, the case was refiled before Judge Panganiban, with the BSP and the PDIC insisting that it was \"an entirely different case\". However, Panganiban ruled that the case was refiled and that it came from the previous case that was filed before her. All that the BSP and the PDIC did was drop the name of Eizmendi and in turn substitute Urban Bank, the Bangko Sentral and the PDIC as the parties \"damaged and prejudiced\".\n\nIncidentally, though, the five-million pesos deposited by Eizmendi were deposited in an account with Bank of Commerce under the name of Borlongan in trust for Eizmendi on July 11, 2000. It was deposited there after the supposed awarding of the assets of Urban Bank to Bank of Commerce and after the PDIC refused to accept the funds from Borlongan on May 17, 2000, despite its obligation as the receiver of UBI.\n\nUrban Bank claims that the reason why the PDIC refused the funds was obvious: they would eventually file this and more cases against UBI officers. However, when Eizmendi requested his funds from Bank of Commerce in February 2002, the bank alleges that the Bangko Sentral intimidated Eizmendi to turn over his personal fund to Exportbank, the successor of Urban Bank. But, in a letter written by Eizmendi's lawyer on June 25, 2002, he alleges that the Bangko Sentral is demanding that he turn over his funds to Exportbank, as shown in the following excerpt:\n\nInvestigation Slip no. 1436 was filed by the Bangko Sentral and the PDIC against Lilibeth Fajardo, former Vice President of Finance at San Miguel Corporation and a member of the Urban Bank board. The case is similar to the one highlighted on Investigation Slip No. 1217, which is alleged estafa surrounding a one-million peso bank account with Urban Bank that was partially preterminated.\n\nThe case was filed as Criminal Case No. 01-2531 on July 31, 2000, at Makati City RTC Branch 147 on July 31, 2000. This case was heard by Judge Ma. Cristina Cornejo.\n\nIt was believed that Fajardo asked her associate to ask defendant Borlongan to preterminate her deposit with Urban Bank. However, she refused to accept the one-million peso partial withdrawal when the transaction was completed. Eventually, Borlongan deposited these funds with Bank of Commerce in his name in trust for Fajardo on July 11, 2000, some three weeks before this complaint was filed.\n\nNo verdict was issued, but a year later, on September 20, 2002, the prosecution inexplicably filed before the court a Motion to Admit Amended Information, which was not released. This was done after the court rejected Borlongan's Motion to Quash the Information. Two years later, on October 18, 2004, Borlongan filed before the Court of Appeals a petition after the judge presiding over that trial admitted the amended information and questionably denied his motion for a preliminary investigation into the charges.\n\nThe Bangko Sentral and the PDIC accused Urban Bank officials of estafa related to economic sabotage in Investigation Slip No. 1512, a crime punishable under Presidential Decree No. 1689, a Marcos-era decree punishing estafa committed \"by syndicates on rural banks, cooperatives, samahang nayons, farmers' associations and other institutions\" with life imprisonment to death.\n\nThis case was filed as Criminal Case No. 00-2217 on September 11, 2000, at the Makati City RTC Branch 56. Regional Trial Judge Zeus Abrogar found lack of merit in the case against two of the respondents, chairman Arsenio Bartolome III and corporate secretary Corazon Bejasa, due to their non-participation in the activities of the credit committee, and dismissed the charges against them. Abrogar found probable cause against the remaining respondents. The case was heard by Judge Nemesio Felix, who eventually heard a similar case a month later.\n\nThis case at first was originally stipulated by the Department of Justice as non-bailable economic sabotage, but was later \"modified\" to bailable economic sabotage against all ten of the accused under P.D. 1689.\n\nHowever, Urban Bank argues that the following evidence disprove the said charge and the similar charge below:\n\n\nIt is because of that evidence that Urban Bank argued that it was baseless for the BSP and the PDIC to label the subject loans as \"garbage\" and \"trash\" when it gave favorable ratings towards those loans two months before the closure of the bank. They said that for the past six years, ever since Urban Bank was granted its quasi-bank license in 1994, the Bangko Sentral has always examined the loan purchases Urban Bank has made, allowing it to transfer loans from UII under the BSP's own rules and regulations.\n\nNo verdict was issued but Urban Bank claims that the foregoing case exposes the malice of the BSP and the PDIC in filing these charges.\n\nIn Investigation Slip No. 1708, the Bangko Sentral and the PDIC accused Urban Bank of estafa related to an accused illegal purchase of \"trash\" loans amounting to some 1.8 billion pesos on both April 24 and April 25, 2000.\n\nThis case was filed as Criminal Complaint Nos. 01-406 and 407 at the Makati City RTC Branch 56 on October 26, 2000. The cases were heard by Judge Nemesio Felix, the same judge that heard the case involving Investigation Slip No. 1512.\n\nThe case bears resemblance to the previous case just filed a month earlier (I.S. No. 1512). According to defendant Borlongan, Urban Bank acted within the bounds of law and BSP rules to buy the loans from its subsidiary, Urbancorp Investments (UII), as the only other alternative due to the refusal of the BSP to provide timely and sufficient assistance to stem the panic withdrawals that Urban Bank accuses were caused by the BSP.\n\nJudge Felix ruled the case in favor of Urban Bank after it had been discovered that all funds of UBI and UII, including their trust departments, were accounted for. It was also stated that the loans were genuine, purchased lawfully, secured by adequate collateral and were covered by more than sufficient loan loss-reserves as required by the Bangko Sentral in examinations conducted in 1999 and 2000.\n\nThe Bangko Sentral in Investigation Slip No. 1828 accused Urban Bank of violating Section 23 of Republic Act No. 337, the General Banking Act, and Monetary Board Resolution No. 628. This case was filed as Criminal Complaint Nos. 01-1915, 1916 and 1917 at the Makati City RTC Branch 146 and were all heard by Judge Cesar Santamaria.\n\nInvestigation Slip No. 1828 accused Urban Bank of violating Section 23 of Republic Act No. 337, the General Banking Act, in relation to Section X303 of the BSP Manual of Regulations for Banks. The section talks about loan limits to a single borrower, which are usually administrative in nature.\n\nThere is no historical precedent to this: the Bangko Sentral has never filed any criminal charges against banks that have violated that portion of the law. The usual punishment was a reprimand against the executives, but if done subsequently, more severe punishments, such as daily fines until the problem is resolved, are considered. However, Urban Bank accuses the BSP of jumping right into filing this case before giving it any sort of warning.\n\nThis case was decided in favor of the prosecution, but an appeal was filed by defendant Borlongan. A temporary restraining order had been issued by the Court of Appeals against the court deciding in the case from arraigning the accused.\n\nThe BSP in Investigation Slip No. 1828 also accused Urban Bank of violating BSP Monetary Board Resolution No. 628, which is clearly administrative in nature. It talks about limits on loan exposure to real estate loans, which the Bangko Sentral claims Urban Bank failed to follow. Although the resolution exists, the resolution was never printed in the Official Gazette or in a newspaper of general circulation as required by law, as accused by defendant Borlongan.\n\nThe oddity in this case was that this case was filed in the last three days before Urban Bank declared a bank holiday, as they believed this was filed due to their accusation that the Bangko Sentral did not provide them sufficient financial assistance to curb the panic withdrawals.\n\nOn April 18, 2008, the Supreme Court of the Philippines 2nd Division affirmed the appellate court's judgment to proceed with the PHP 4.5 billion (US$109 million) estafa case against the officers of Urban Bank, namely, Nida S. Santos, Milagros Santiago, Rowena Punzalan, Chulla Formanes, Loida O. Payonga and Amalia Ordas.\n\nOn other cases filed... The BSP Media Section reported on 06.08.2004:\n\n\"The Court of Appeals has dismissed the administrative complaint filed against BSP Governor Rafael B. Buenaventura and five other BSP officials regarding Urban Bank’s receivership, thereby setting aside its earlier order to suspend the Governor and other BSP officers.\n\nIn an Amended Decision penned by Associate Justice Lucas P. Bersamin and promulgated on June 4, 2004, by the Court of Appeals, the CA Special Division of Five also unanimously rejected the motion for reconsideration of complainant Teodoro Borlongan, former Urban Bank President, seeking the dismissal of the BSP officials. Under CA rules, when there is disagreement in a division, the case goes to an expanded division of five. The Fifth Division included Associate Justices Bersamin, Eugenio S. Labitoria, and Elvi John S. Asuncion; Associate Justices Salvador J. Valdez, Jr., and Rebecca de Guia-Salvador completed the expanded Division.\n\nThe associate justices were unanimous in clearing BSP Governor Buenaventura of the charges alleged by Mr. Borlongan. Except for the dissenting vote of Associate Justice Labitoria, all the other associate justices similarly exonerated or cleared BSP officials Alberto V. Reyes (deputy governor), Dolores B. Yuvienco (managing director), Candon B. Guerrero (director) and Tomas Aure (former director).\n\nBSP Governor Buenaventura hailed the Amended Decision of the Court of Appeals clearing the BSP officials of the charges related to Urban Bank’s receivership. He said the Court of Appeals decision “should strengthen the resolve of others in government to continue to do their work with vigilance and courage, and to keep faith in the justice system.”\n\nThe Governor declared: “We at the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas have always believed that the courts will rule in our favor. We are professionals and we stand by the integrity of our actions and intentions.”\n\nBSP's timely decision to place Urban Bank under receivership protected the depositors and the general public. It also facilitated the takeover and assumption by Export and Industry Bank (EIB) of Urban Bank's assets and liabilities, which allowed EIB's repayment of assumed liabilities including deposits.\n\nIn the Amended Decision, the Court of Appeals ruled that the dismissal of the administrative charges against the BSP Governor and the BSP General Counsel by the Ombudsman is final and unappealable, following the Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman.\n\nThe Amended Decision also held that:\n\n\nThis case arose after the Monetary Board placed Urban Bank under receivership following the unilateral declaration of a bank holiday by Urban Bank on April 25, 2000. Upon the takeover of Urban Bank by the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC) as receiver, serious irregularities in said bank were uncovered consisting of the massive transfer of deposit funds from said bank to its affiliate, the Urbancorp Investments Inc.(UII). In particular, deposit funds totaling P4.60 billion from Urban Bank were exchanged for doubtful receivables from UII just before the declaration of a bank holiday, thereby causing the bank's illiquid position.\n\nGovernment supervisors also uncovered unauthorized pre-termination of money market placements of certain investors and violations of bank regulations on single borrower's limit and the limit on real estate exposure. With these findings, the Department of Justice filed four (4) cases for estafa and three (3) criminal cases for violations of bank regulations against Mr. Borlongan. These cases are being pursued in the Makati Regional Trial Court by DOJ prosecutors and by lawyers from both BSP and PDIC.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Borlongan filed criminal and administrative complaints in the Ombudsman against the BSP Governor and other officers of the BSP. The Ombudsman has since dismissed the criminal charges, and this dismissal was affirmed by the Supreme Court with finality in its two (2) Resolutions dated Oct. 13, 2003 and Nov. 24, 2003. The Ombudsman also dismissed the administrative charges against the BSP Governor and the BSP General Counsel Juan de Zuñiga, Jr., but held that the other BSP officials are liable for simple neglect of duty for which their suspension for one month and one day was ordered.\n\nFrom this Ombudsman decision, Reyes et al. appealed to the CA, and their case was assigned to the 17th Division, chaired by Associate Justice Mario L. Guarina III. Mr. Borlongan also appealed the Ombudsman decision to seek the dismissal of the BSP officials; his case was assigned to the 5th Division of the CA chaired by Associate Justice Labitoria, which proceeded to resolve the case and denied the motion for the consolidation of the case with the earlier filed case with the 17th Division. In the contested resolution of the 5th Division issued on Aug.13, 2003, the suspension for one year of Gov. Buenaventura and BSP officials Reyes, Yuvienco, Guerrero and Aure was ordered for “alleged gross neglect of duty.”\n\nIn a contrasting decision, the 17th Division on Sept. 18, 2003 found no basis for the administrative charges against the BSP officials and dismissed the same. The decision, penned by Associate Justice Mario Guarina III and concurred in by Associate Justices Martin S. Villarama, Jr. and Jose C. Reyes, Jr. said: “ Urban Bank’s Borlongan has taken extraordinary effort to expose, malign and destroy the SES (BSP’s Supervision and Examination Sector) reports. His tirades fail to convince us……At a time when indecision and hesitation have become the order of the day in our society and government, the decisiveness shown by the petitioners in this case shows that our people have not yet lost the political will to enforce the law and protect the public interest beyond personal ties or convenience. Many more acts of silent heroism among our civil servants might be needed before we can finally rise Gunmar Myrdal’s lasting criticism of the soft state.”\n\nActing on the motion for reconsideration of Mr. Borlongan, the 17th Division affirmed the dismissal of the charges. The decision of the 17th Division has been appealed by Mr. Borlongan to the Supreme Court where it is pending.\n\nWhile Urban Bank and its senior officers continue to maintain...\n\"In the Urban Bank case, Urban Bank president Borlongan compared the case of Urban Bank to that of Banco Filipino, which was closed for the same reasons.\"\n\nIn actuality: \"Borlongan’s citation of the Banco Filipino Supreme Court ruling is misplaced since the latter was based on the old Central Bank Act (R.A. No. 265, as amended) whereas the basis for the receivership of Urban Bank is the new BSP Charter (R.A. No. 7653).\"\n\nSo, the following comparison of the cases is not relevant when Urban Bank alleged that its treatment in its closure case was worse than that of Banco Filipino. The cases were compared on the following points:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2270999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270999", "title": "Anga", "text": "Anga\n\nAnga was an ancient Indian kingdom that flourished on the eastern Indian subcontinent and one of the sixteen mahajanapadas (\"large state\"). It lay to the east of its neighbour and rival, Magadha, and was separated from it by the river Champa in the modern day Bhagalpur in the state of Bihar. The capital of Anga was located on the bank of this river and was also named Champa. It was prominent for its wealth and commerce. Anga was annexed by Magadha in the 6th century BCE.\n\nCounted among the \"sixteen great nations\" in Buddhist texts like the Anguttara Nikaya, Anga also finds mention in the Jain Vyakhyaprajnapti’s list of ancient janapadas. Some sources note that the Angas were grouped with people of ‘mixed origin’, generally in the later ages.\n\nAccording to the Mahabharata (I.104.53-54) and Puranic literature, \"Anga\" was named after Prince Anga, the founder of the kingdom, and the son of Sutapa, who had no sons. So, he requested the sage, Dirghatamas, to bless him with sons. The sage is said to have begotten five sons through his wife, the queen Sudesna. The princes were named Anga, Vanga, Kalinga, Sumha and Pundra.\n\nThe Ramayana (1.23.14) narrates the origin of name \"Anga\" as the place where Kamadeva was burnt to death by Siva and where his body parts (\"angas\") are scattered.\n\nThe earliest mention occurs in the Atharvaveda (V.22.14) where they are listed alongside the \"Magadhas\", \"Gandharis\" and the \"Mujavatas\", all apparently as a despised people. Puranic texts place the janapadas of the Angas, Kalingas, Vangas, Pundras (or Pundra Kingdom - now some part of Eastern Bihar, West Bengal and Bangladesh), Vidarbhas, and Vindhya-vasis in the \"Purva-Dakshina\" division.\n\nThe Puranas also list several early kings of Anga. The \"Mahagovinda Suttanta\" refers to king Dhatarattha of Anga. Jain texts refer to Dhadhivahana, as a ruler of the Angas. Puranas and Harivamsa represent him as the son and immediate successor of \"Anga\", the eponymous founder of the kingdom. Jain traditions place him at the beginning of sixth century BCE. According to the Mahabharata(Adi Parv, Section CXXXVIII), Duryodhana had named Karna the King of Anga.\n\nBetween the Vatsas and the realm of Anga, lived the Magadhas, who initially were comparatively a weak people. A great struggle went on between the Angas and its eastern neighbours. The \"Vidhura Pandita Jataka\" describes Rajagriha (the Magadhan Capital) as the city of Anga and Mahabharata also refers to a sacrifice performed by the king of Anga at \"Mount Vishnupada\" (at Gaya). This indicates that Anga had initially succeeded in annexing the Magadhas and thus its borders extended to the kingdom of Matsya country.\n\nThis success of Angas did not last long. About the middle of 6th century BCE, Bimbisara, the crown prince of Magadha had killed Brahmadatta, the last independent king of Anga and seized Champa. Bimbisara made it as his headquarters and ruled over it as his father's Viceroy. Thenceforth, Anga became an integral part of growing Magadha empire (PHAI, 1996).\n\n\"Sabhaparava\" of Mahabharata (II.44.9) mentions Anga and Vanga as forming one country. The \"Katha-Sarit-Sagara\" also attests that Vitankapur, a city of Anga was situated on the shores of the sea. Thus the boundaries of Anga may have extended to the sea in the east. Anga was bounded by river Kaushiki on the north.\n\nThe capital of Anga was Champa (, formerly known as Malini), one of the greatest cities of the 6th century BCE. It was situated at the confluence of the Ganga and the Champa (now probably the Chandan) rivers. It was a notable centre of trade and commerce and its merchants have been described as sailing to distant Suvarnabhumi (probably in Southeast Asia). Mahabharata tradition places it on river Kaushiki. The city has been linked with the present-day villages of Champapur and Champanagar about west of Bhagalpur in the state of southern Bihar. Archaeologically, the ancient city had an occupation of the Northern Black Polished Ware culture, with a surrounding fortification and moat.\n\nDuring his pilgrimage there in the end of the 4th century, the Chinese monk Faxian noted the numerous Buddhist temples that still existed in the city, transliterated \"Chanpo\" in Chinese (瞻波 ). The kingdom of Anga by then had long ceased to exist; it had been known as Yāngjiā (鴦伽) in Chinese.\n\n\n\n"}

It has an umbrella-like canopy that spreads to a diameter of 12 to 15 meters (40 to 50 feet) and can attain a height of 12 to 18 meters (40 to 60 feet). Because it is derived from herbaceous ancestors, its trunk consists of anomalous secondary thickening rather than true wood. As a result, the ombú grows fast but its wood is soft and spongy enough to be cut with a knife. These properties have led it to be used in the art of bonsai, as it is easily manipulated to create the desired effect. Since the sap is poisonous, the ombú is not grazed by cattle and is immune to locusts and other pests. For similar reasons, the leaves are sometimes used as a laxative or purgative. It is a symbol of Uruguay and Argentina, and of gaucho culture, as its canopy is quite distinguishable from afar and provides comfort and shelter from sun and rain.\n\nThis tree is categorized in the same genus as the North American pokeweed. The species is also cultivated in Southern California as a shade tree. Ombú has been declared as a minor invasive species (category 3) in South Africa, where it is widely planted.\n"}

The term is mostly used in the United States.\n\nUntil the 1980s, there were many coachbuilders in the United States that produced professional cars. The cars were built on long-wheelbase versions of American full-size chassis, such as the 1931–1976 Cadillac Commercial Chassis, 1937–1954 Packard 180 and 1965–1975 Oldsmobile 98.\n\nSince the 1970s, ambulances began to provide increasing levels of on-scene care, which required more equipment to be transported and therefore larger vehicles. It was no longer feasible for ambulances to be based on passenger car chassis, therefore the use of professional cars as ambulances declined. The downsizing of American full-size passenger cars to smaller chassis from 1977 also reduced the feasibility of professional cars.\n\n"}

They are also widely encountered as the mother tongue on the Matsu Islands controlled by the Republic of China. Additionally, the inhabitants of Taishun and Cangnan to the north of Fujian in Zhejiang also speak Eastern Min varieties. Eastern Min generally coexists with the official standard Chinese in all these areas.\n\nAs the coastal area of Fujian has been the historical homeland of a large worldwide diaspora of overseas Chinese, varieties of Eastern Min can also be found across the world, especially in their respective Chinatowns. Cities with high concentrations of such immigrants include New York City, especially Little Fuzhou, Manhattan, Sunset Park, Brooklyn and Flushing, Queens.\n\nThey are also found in various Chinatown communities in Europe, including London, Paris and Prato in Italy.\n\nChinese communities within Ikebukuro, Tokyo as well as Sibu, Sarawak, Malaysia have significant populations of Eastern Min speakers. Fuzhou communities can also be found in Sitiawan, Perak and Yong Peng, Johor in West Malaysia.\n\nEastern Min is conventionally divided into three branches:\n\nBesides these three branches, some dialect islands in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong were classified as Eastern Min. \nZhongshan Min is a group of Min varieties spoken in the Zhongshan county of Guangdong. According to Nicholas Bodman, only the Longdu dialect and Nanlang dialect belong to the Eastern Min group, while the Sanxiang dialect belongs to Southern Min.\n\nThe Eastern Min group has a phonology which is particularly divergent from other varieties of Chinese. Aside from the Manjiang dialect, both Houguan and Funing groups are similar in the number of initials, with the Fu'an dialect having 17 initials, two more than the Fuzhou dialect, the additions being and or as separate phonemes (the glottal stop is common to both but excluded from this count). The Manjiang dialect on the other hand has been influenced by the Wu dialects of Zhejiang, and hence has significantly more initials than the varieties of Fujian.\n\nThe finals vary significantly between varieties, with the extremes being represented by Manjiang dialects at a low of 39 separate finals, and the Ningde dialect representing the high at 69 finals.\n\nEastern Min varieties generally have seven tones, by the traditional count (based on the four tones of Middle Chinese, including the entering tone as a separate entity). In the middle of the Qing dynasty, eight tones were attested, but the historical rising tones () re-merged.\n\nThe Eastern Min varieties have a wide of range of sandhi phenomena. As well as tone sandhi, common to many varieties of Chinese, there is also the assimilation of consonants and vowel alternations (such as rime tensing).\n\nTone sandhi across Eastern Min varieties can be regressive (where the last syllable affects the pronunciation of those before), progressive (where earlier syllables affect the later ones) or mutual (where both or all syllables change). The rules are generally quite complicated.\n\nInitial assimilation of consonants is usually progressive, and may create new phonemes that are not phonemically contrastive in initial position but do contrast in medial position. A few varieties exhibit regressive assimilation too.\n\n\n"}

This name had a reference to Marcel Duchamp, who used “Rrose Sélavy” (like eros c’est la vie) as one of his feminine pseudonyms. The group would soon shorten the name to R Irwin S.\n\nIn 1984, the group co-founded a larger collective known as Neue Slowenische Kunst (NSK). Acting as the fine arts wing of the group, they joined the musical group Laibach, and the Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre group. Soon after the formation of the larger collective, R Irwin S changed its name to simply Irwin.\n\nIn 1987, IRWIN, Novi Kolektivizem and Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre were involved in one of the greatest art scandals in the history of Yugoslavia when they proposed a poster, based on a Nazi kunst poster, for the celebration of the Youth Day, Tito's birth anniversary. In the history of art, this scandal is known as the Poster Scandal. In 2012, D'Art documentaries production is to release a 1-hour documentary about the scandal, entitled \"The Fine Art of Mirroring\".\n\nIrwin’s work is defined largely by three main principles. The first is the idea of building one’s own artistic position out of one’s particular circumstances; by being particular, art can become truly universal. The second is working in a group, a collective, or even an organization, shifting the emphasis away from the individual personality of the artist. The third is the fundamental NSK working procedure sometimes called the retro-principle. The latter principle gives rise to the concept known as “retroavantgardism” (or, later “retrogardism”). As the name implies, retroavantgardism is somewhat paradoxical because it calls for simultaneously looking backward (“retro”) and forward (“avant-garde”). This position is evident in the paradoxical title of an official statement of the group in 1987, “The Future is the seed of the past.” In essence, retroavantgardism consists in the recycled use of past symbols, images and philosophical ideas, particularly those that have been used by governments or other institutions to accumulate and hold power.\n\nIrwin is also very interested in the idea of the complexity of the image. For them, an image is never neutral, nor does it ever appear in a neutral space. Thus their work can be tied to the larger international inquiry known as Institutional Critique. Directly drawing upon images that have strong political and/or artistic connotations, including fascist, Soviet, religious, and Suprematist images, Irwin’s art is complex and has a traumatic and provocative effect. Reflecting their belief that there is no neutral space, Irwin’s work becomes increasingly concerned with location, both in performance pieces, but also in exhibitions. The self-curation of their shows becomes as much a part of the work, as the pieces themselves.\n\nIrwin’s “paintings” incorporate a number of media including paint, tar, books, dishes, Lego, silkscreens and many others. The works are not signed by the group, in a traditional sense, but are presented to the collective for approval. The work will then be stamped with the groups monogram—often on a metal plate.\n\nAlthough primarily painters, they have engaged in many collaborative works with other NSK art collectives, ranging from theater to music video. In 1992, in cooperation with Michael Benson, they created the performance Black Square on Red Square, in which a square of black cloth, 22 meters to a side, was unfurled on Moscow's Red Square, in homage to Kazimir Malevich and suprematism. Others of their more notable activities have included the planning of the NSK Embassies and Consulates in Moscow, Gent and Florence, and the Transnacionala project—a journey from the east to the west coast of the United States in 1996.\n\nEast Art Map is a project to create a history and vocabulary for Eastern European art starting in 1945 by identifying and compiling a sourcebook of influential artists.\n\nIrwin have exhibited widely in Europe and the USA, including Manifesta in Rotterdam and Ljubljana, Venice Biennial, After the Wall, and Aspects/Positions. In 2004, they have received the Jakopič Award, the highest annual award in Slovene fine arts.\n\n\n\n"}

Keiko Takemiya introduced Hagio to Takemiya's editor, Junya Yamamoto, who accepted all of Hagio's works that Kodansha had rejected. When Hagio began drawing manga, she cut large sheets of \"manga paper\" to B4 size, and she still uses a G-Pen and a Maru-Pen. When she began drawing manga, she used India ink and a brush, but now uses Copic markers. Later, for Shogakukan Publishing, she produced a series of short stories for various magazines. Two years after her debut, she published \"Juichigatsu no Gimunajiumu\" (\"The November Gymnasium\"), a short story that dealt openly with love between two boys at a boarding school. The story was part of a larger movement by female manga artists at the time that pioneered \"shōnen-ai\", a genre of girls' comics about love between young men. In 1974, Hagio developed this story into the longer \"Thomas no Shinzō\" (\"The Heart of Thomas\"). She was awarded the Shogakukan Manga Award in 1976 for her science fiction classic \"Juichinin Iru!\" (\"They Were Eleven\") and her epic tale \"Poe no Ichizoku\" (\"The Poe Clan\"). In the mid-1980s, Hagio wrote her first long work – \"Marginal\". Prior to writing \"Iguana Girl\" in 1991, Hagio had not set her works in contemporary Japan. Moto Hagio had a role in the 2008 film \"Domomata no Shi\" (\"Death of Domomata\"). On June 11, 2009, a party was held in Moto Hagio's honor, \"celebrating her 40th year as a professional manga artist\". Approximately 200 people attended. In 2011, Joshibi University of Art and Design appointed Hagio as a guest professor.\n\nHagio is a science fiction fan, and considers Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke and Robert Heinlein to have influenced her, and she has adapted several of Ray Bradbury's short stories from \"R is for Rocket\" into manga format.\n\n\nFew of her works appear in English, but here are some that do:\n\n\n\"A, A\"' and \"They Were Eleven\" have science fiction settings, and both \"They Were Eleven\" and \"X+Y\" include transgender elements. The science fiction aspects in particular have led to Hagio's work appealing to manga readers who do not generally like shōjo manga.\n\nA 2010 anthology, \"A Drunken Dream and Other Stories\", collects the following stories:\n\n\nThese were selected by translator Rachel Thorn to be a representative sample of Moto Hagio's whole career, with the input of a mixi fan club for Hagio.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2271040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271040", "title": "A, A Prime", "text": "A, A Prime\n\nA, A Prime is a manga anthology of short stories written and illustrated by Moto Hagio. Originally spelled A, A′, it was first published in November 1984 by Shogakukan and brings together three science fiction stories published between 1981 and 1984. In addition to the titular short story which appeared in Akita Shoten's \"Princess\", the anthology includes \"4/4 [Quatre-Quarts]\" and \"X+Y\"—both of which were serialized in the Shogakukan magazine \"Petit Flower\". English translations of the stories, which first appeared separately in Viz Media's \"Manga Vizion\" from 1995 to 1996, were collected by the publisher in 1997.\n\nThe anthology deals with gender, identity and memory; gender ambiguity and androgyny are typical of Hagio's characters. Although androgyny is present in all three stories, \"X+Y\" most emphasizes gender and sexuality with its genetically-female man, sex changes and a homosexual relationship. The story won the 1985 Seiun Best Comic Award, and its English-language version was praised for its artwork and emotion. It is also regarded as having introduced gender-bending to the \"shōjo\" manga genre. \n\nSet in a shared futuristic universe, the stories' common thread is a genetically-engineered \"Unicorn\" species created for space travel. Extremely intelligent, with a humanoid appearance, they have difficulty understanding other people and their own emotions.\n\nA research group is attempting to terraform the planet Munzel. Since the mission is dangerous, each member of the group was cloned before departure. The plot revolves around the arrival of the clone of the Unicorn, Adelade Lee. Adelade's clone, with no memory of the three years Adelade lived on Munzel, disturbs Regg Bone, who had a romantic relationship with Adelade. Although he knows she is a clone, the resemblance attracts him and he kisses her to a dispassionate reaction. When Adelade's clone explores the planet Munzel with Regg, they find Adelade's body frozen in a cave. Regg soon asks to be transferred to Space Colony A on the planet Torimann. When Colony A is destroyed in an explosion and Regg dies, Adelade's clone is emotionally shaken; Regg is replaced by his clone, and Adelade's clone weeps when she remembers their kiss.\n\nOn Jupiter's moon Io, Mori, a man with telekinetic powers he cannot control, is training with Professor Mia. After he saves a Unicorn descendant named Trill from a free fall, he frequently visits her in the home of Professor Sazzan, the man who adopted her. When Mori discovers that Sazzan is only interested in his telekinetic powers, he runs away with Trill. Mori kisses Trill, but when she says she loves him and Sazzan equally he overheats and burns Mia's aviary. Mia sends Mori to Mars; Trill's repressed feelings are released, and she expresses her hatred for Sazzan and his experiments. When Sazzan tries to assault Trill she breaks a vase on his head and runs to an airlock, where she falls to her death in front of Mori, who is aboard a ship leaving for Mars.\n\nUnicorn Tacto's mother, Marble, committed suicide in his presence when he was seven. His father, Doctor Moonsault, had developed a sex-change drug with an intended temporary effect; however, when Marble took it she remained a woman for three years. Moonsault and Marble married and one month after Tacto's birth, Marble became a man. Marble wanted to be a woman, but he was resistant to the medicine. This, and Moonsault seeing other women, led Marble to commit suicide. Moonsault erased Tacto's memory before leaving on a space mission; Tacto was raised by Doctor George, who brings him to the Allergy Culture Center. Tacto becomes one of its \"brains\" who develop the Tako Project, Earth's entry in a contest to raise Mars' atmospheric pressure.\n\nOn Mars, Tacto meets Mori (from \"4/4\"). Mori, stunned at the resemblance between Tacto and Trill, falls in love with him. Tacto does not feel the same way and is engaged to Merimé, the cousin of Tako Project member Zazz. This angers Mori, and after their talk, Tacto loses all memory of him. The project requires bringing water from Jupiter, and the group goes to nearby planet Mimas. To regain Tacto's affection, Mori invites him on a scooter tour across Jupiter's rings and they have an accident. Mori, seriously injured, wakes up in an emergency room and goes to search for Tacto who has been missing for 16 hours. He rescues Tacto, they bond emotionally, and Tacto breaks his engagement to Merimé. Moonsault arrives at the request of George's wife, An-An, to help Tacto (who is genetically a woman) decide whether to use female hormones. The doctor explains that Tacto changed his sex frequently, and says that the decision is Tacto's—who remains a man. When his father reveals what happened to Marble, he regains the ability to understand his feelings and knows that he loves Mori.\n\n\"A, A Prime\", as published in Japanese and English, is a collection of three science fiction short stories: the titular story, and \"X+Y\". \"A, A Prime\" was published in \"Princess\", an Akita Shoten magazine, in August 1981. \"4/4\" and \"X+Y\" were published in Shogakukan's \"Petit Flower\"—the former in November 1983, and the latter in two parts in July and August 1984. The stories were first compiled and published on November 20, 1984, as the last installment of a Shogakukan series of Moto Hagio's complete works. A \"tankōbon\" containing the three stories was republished three times by Shogakukan: on August 30, 1995 as part of the \"SF Masterpiece Collection\", on August 9, 2003 in \"bunkoban\" format and on August 25, 2014 in EPUB format.\n\nThe English version of the stories appeared in the Viz Media magazine \"Manga Vizion\": \"A, A Prime\" in April and May 1995, \"4/4\" in July and August and \"X+Y\" in four installments from October 1995 to January 1996. Viz Media published the anthology as a graphic novel in October 1997.\n\nAccording to the back cover of the Viz Media edition, the Unicorn's \"personal struggles\" are a metaphor for human alienation in contemporary society. However, anthropologist Matt Thorn commented the Unicorns are the \"eccentrics\", a common feature in Hagio's works. Usually, wrote Thorn, Hagio's stories center \"on a remarkable and strange character who [...] seems incapable of so-called 'normal' human interaction\" until a \"straight man\", \"unsure of his place in the world, and just trying to muddle through [...] forms a unique bond with the 'eccentric.'\" In \"A, A Prime\", Regg Bone and Mori are those straight men.\n\nAlthough the cover says that \"X+Y\" discusses gender and sexual identity, Michell Smith of Pop Culture Shock wrote that all three stories explore \"themes of gender and identity\". Former Viz editor Shaenon K. Garrity said that it \"is really about identity in all its forms: sexual identity, gender identity, cloning, lost memories, blocked emotions\", and emotional isolation. Manga Bookshelf's Katherine Dacey wrote: \"One of [its] most striking themes is the relationship between memory and identity\", demonstrated by \"A, A Prime\" and the character of Tacto.\n\nIn the \"Comics Journal\", Rob Vollmar wrote that Hagio gives \"4/4\" and \"X+Y\" a \"shōnen-ai\" beat and explores gender ambiguity; in \"4/4\" Mori is depicted as hyper-emotional, and Trill (a woman) has no feelings. Vollmar also highlighted the androgyny of \"A, A Primes main characters, noting that Mori and Trill are even more androgynous. In \"X+Y\", \"[The] muted sense of gender identity that is kept to the sub-textual level in '4/4' is transformed into the central conceit ... Hagio effectively scrambles gender awareness until little is left by which to prejudge the dynamic growth of the characters but the result. The resolution of the conflict, then, lies not in whether Mori will overcome his heterosexuality to recognize his biological resonance with the presumably male Tacto, but whether Tacto can remember and thus overcome his childhood experiences in order to accept love from anyone.\" According to Vollmar, the problems raised by Hagio are not only romantic but \"thorny moral and ethical questions\". Vollmar wrote that Hagio questions the dichotomy between \"shōjo\" and \"shōnen\" in her treatment of gender.\n\nAlthough \"X+Y\" was well received by Japanese critics (winning the 1985 Seiun Award for Best Comic), Michelle Smith called it the weakest of the three stories. According to Smith, Mori and Tacto's relationship is \"far too rushed\" and Mori's rationale for being in love was unclear. She criticized Mori's causing the accident, and wrote that the subplot about Tacto's chromosomes \"[doesn't] make much sense\". Smith praised the other two stories and the collection's artistic style, saying that it \"doesn't look like anything else\". She wrote that the title story alone made \"A, A Prime\" worth reading, praising its ending and saying that she would like to see another story with its characters. \"4/4\" was second best in Smith's opinion, and she enjoyed the portrayal of Trill's lack of emotional involvement. Steve Whitaker, for \"The Slings & Arrows Comic Guide\", called \"A, A Prime\" \"a masterful example of science fiction in a shojo\", praising its art: \"Facials and montages are carefully played-off against the portrayal of the various planets and their communities\".\n\nDescribing the anthology as a \"flawless jewel of science fiction\", Shaenon K. Garrity called it an emotional work which touched her deeply: \"Because of \"A, A Prime\", I discovered that this art form could do more than I'd imagined—not just tell ambitious stories, which I already knew from reading \"Sandman\" and \"Bone\" and \"Watchmen\", but tell them with passion, in lines drawn from nerve endings, using every weapon in the artist's arsenal to not just dazzle the mind, but stab straight to the heart.\" Katherine Dacey also praised the \"intensely Romantic quality of all three stories\" and their artwork, particularly Hagio's representation of the characters' memories and emotional states with \"symbolically rich imagery\" and a \"dream-like quality\". Dacey cited Hagio's \"unique ability to mix the sublime with the ridiculous\", such as the characters' names and costumes and the sex-change drug.\n\nAccording to Rob Vollmar, \"A, A Prime\" is an important part of \"the evolution of shoujo out of shonen manga\". It was cited by Garrity as \"one of the forerunners to countless modern manga with inventive gender-bending elements\", such as Rumiko Takahashi's \"Ranma ½\". Another Takahashi work, \"Urusei Yatsura\", has a storyline in which clones are differentiated from the originals by apostrophes on their heads, referring to \"A, A Primes title.\n"}

It was devised by Moshé M. Zloof at IBM Research during the mid-1970s, in parallel to the development of SQL. It is the first graphical query language, using visual tables where the user would enter commands, example elements and conditions. Many graphical front-ends for databases use the ideas from QBE today. Originally limited only for the purpose of retrieving data, QBE was later extended to allow other operations, such as inserts, deletes and updates, as well as creation of temporary tables.\n\nThe motivation behind QBE is that a parser can convert the user's actions into statements expressed in a database manipulation language, such as SQL. Behind the scenes, it is this statement that is actually executed. A suitably comprehensive front-end can minimize the burden on the user to remember the finer details of SQL, and it is easier and more productive for end-users (and even programmers) to select tables and columns by selecting them rather than typing in their names,\n\nIn the context of information retrieval, QBE has a somewhat different meaning. The user can submit a document, or several documents, and ask for \"similar\" documents to be retrieved from a document database [see search by multiple examples]. Similarity search is based comparing document vectors (see Vector Space Model).\n\nQBE is a seminal work in end-user development, frequently cited in research papers as an early example of this topic.\n\nCurrently, QBE is supported in several relational database front ends, notably Microsoft Access, which implements \"Visual Query by Example\", as well as Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Manager. It is also implemented in several object-oriented databases (e.g. in db4o).\n\nQBE is based on the logical formalism called tableau query, although QBE adds some extensions to that, much like SQL is based on the relational algebra.\n\"Example of QBE query with joins, designed in Borland's Paradox software\"\nAn example using the Suppliers and Parts database is given here to illustrate how QBE works.\n\nThe term also refers to a general technique influenced by Zloof's work whereby only items with search values are used to \"filter\" the results. It provides a way for a software user to perform queries without having to know a query language (such as SQL). The software can automatically generate the queries for the user (usually behind the scenes). Here are some examples:\n\nExample Form B:\n\nResulting SQL:\n\nSELECT * FROM Contacts WHERE Name='Bob' AND State='TX';\n\nNote how blank items do not generate SQL terms. Since \"Address\" is blank, there is no clause generated for it.\nFor\nExample Form C:\n\nResulting SQL:\n\nSELECT * FROM Contacts WHERE City='Sampleton' AND Zipcode='12345';\n\nMore advanced versions of QBE have other comparison operator options, often via a pull-down menu, such as \"Contains\", \"Not Contains\", \"Starts With\", \"Greater-Than\", and so forth.\n\nAnother approach to text comparisons is to allow one or more wildcard character characters. For example, if an asterisk is designated as a wild wildcard character in a particular system, then searching for last names using \"Rob*\" would return (match) last names such as \"Rob\", \"Robert\", \"Robertson\", \"Roberto\", etc.\n\n\n\n"}

Winston Hills is located 28 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Parramatta and The Hills Shire. Winston Hills is part of the Hills District region of Greater Western Sydney.\n\nWinston Hills was named after Britain's Prime Minister Winston Churchill (1874–1965) during World War II. With the name being preferred to \"Churchill Hills\". In the early days, this area was named Model Farms (a name retained in a local high school - see below) as this was the area where a model farm was developed to show settlers the types of crops that could be grown in different seasons.\n\nDevelopment of the suburb began in the 1960s by Hooker Rex, and there is little undeveloped land left. In 2009 the last remaining large parcel of vacant land, at Buckleys Hill, started to be developed. There is not much natural bushland left in the suburb, except for the creek corridors, like Toongabbie Creek. It was transferred from the local government area of the City of Blacktown to the City of Parramatta in 1972.\n\nA residence on Oakes Road was sold in December 2011. This property had been owned by the late Frank Whiting. The building on the site was once the accommodation for the staff who worked on the dairy situated on Oakes Road up to what is now Rebecca Parade. This dairy was operated by the Sisters of the Good Shepherd. It operated during the Second World War years.\nFrank purchased the property when the dairy closed in the late 1940s and Frank clearly remembered the One Tree Hill Golf course that ran from behind the dairy along what is now Rebecca Parade and Goliath Avenue up to Old Windsor Road.\n\nWinston Hills has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\nIn the 2016 Census, there were 11,674 people in Winston Hills. 69.5% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were China 2.9%, England 2.8%, India 2.5%, New Zealand 1.7%, and South Korea 1.3%. 72.5% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Arabic 3.4%, Mandarin 3.1%, Cantonese 2.3%, Korean 1.9%, and Hindi 1.3%. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 33.9%, No Religion 19.6% and Anglican 16.1%.\n\nWinston Hills Mall is a shopping centre that features a Big W discount department store, Woolworths supermarket, Coles supermarket, Aldi supermarket, over 75 specialty shops and a food court. \"The Winston\" is a pub and restaurant located next to the shopping mall. Further east along Caroline Chisholm Drive is a small shopping centre known as the Chisholm Centre. On the southern side of the hill is a small shopping centre called the Lomond Centre.\n\nPrimary Schools\n\nBuilt-in 1970, Winston Hills Public School was originally considered to be called \"Model Farms Public School\" due\nto the original name of the area which had been changed only a few years earlier to \"Winston Hills\".\n\nSenior Schools\n\nReitano Private school\n\nWinston Hills has Girl Guides, Scouts, rugby league, baseball, football and netballclubs. The football club (The Bears) is one of the largest in suburban Sydney.\n\nIn 1983, Winston Hills Warriors Baseball Club was established after breaking away from Baulkham Hills. WHBC started playing at Col Sutton Park, just down the road from Model Farms High School. Winston Hills is one of the best clubs in senior A grade baseball in Sydney.\n\nIn 2010, the Winston Hills Girl Guides joined worldwide celebrations for the centenary (100th birthday) of the Guiding movement during the nationally acclaimed 'Year of the Girl Guide'. The Winston Hills Scouts also mark the 40th anniversary for their district.\n\n"}

Radviliškis has been the administrative center of the district since 1950, and is an important railway junction.\n\nRadviliškis was founded at the end of the 15th century. It was first mentioned in the book on state economics by M. Downar-Zapolsky listing the cities taxpayers in 1567. In 1687, John Sobieski, the king of Lithuania and Poland, granted the right of holding a market to it.\n\nRadviliškis was devastated many times by military forces, plague and hunger in the 17th – 19th centuries. There were no citizens left in Radviliškis after the plague in 1708–1710.\nTown growth began when the Liepāja–Romny Railway line, crossing the town, was built in 1870 and Radviliškis–Daugavpils line was built in 1873. Railwaymen constituted the majority of the residents.\n\nAround July 12, 1941, all 300 Jews of Radviliškis were murdered in the Durpunas Forest near the Jewish cemetery by Germans and Lithuanian Activist Front members from Radviliškis.\n\nIn 1998, a sculpture of the Victory goddess Nike was unveiled in the center of Radviliškis to commemorate the eightieth anniversary of the victory over the united German–Russian West Russian Volunteer Army. It was created by sculptor P. Mazuras.\n\nSupposedly, the name originated from the name of the noble Radziwiłł (Radvila) family of Lithuanian origin. This family ruled Radviliškis for more than 200 years, from 1546 to 1764.\n\nA rising and light-emitting horse, representing communication, motion, city development and flourishing, is depicted in the coat of arms of Radviliškis. The light is a symbol of civilization's role in the city development. It was created by artist Laima Ramonienė in 1992.\n\nRadviliškis, settled on everglades, was famous for its railway and black-from-locomotive-smoke sparrows.\n\nThe two symbols of the town are the railways, and black swallows.\n\nThere are Evangelical-reformed, Protestant, Lutheran, and Orthodox chapels, Jewish synagogues and Catholic Churches in Radviliškis.\n\nThe stone windmill of Radviliškis was erected in remembrance of the violent and triumphant battles in 1919 against the German–Russian armed forces.\n\nThe wooden belfry of Radviliškis parish's Blessed Virgin Mary church of the Immaculate Conception is a topical architecture monument.

It ran from 1954 until 1971. The \"San Francisco Chief\" was the last new streamliner introduced by the Santa Fe, its first full train between Chicago and the Bay, the only Chicago-Bay Area train running over just one railroad, and at the longest run in the country on one railroad. The \"San Francisco Chief\" was one of many trains discontinued when Amtrak began operations in 1971.\n\nThe Santa Fe introduced the streamliner on June 6, 1954; it was Santa Fe's last new streamliner and its first direct train from Chicago to the San Francisco Bay Area. It ran via Topeka and the Belen Cutoff through Amarillo, Texas instead of Raton Pass. Like other Santa Fe trains it ran to Oakland, California (Richmond, California after 1958), with a bus connection across the bay to San Francisco, California. At first the \"San Francisco Chief\" handled through cars for cities in Texas, plus a New Orleans, Louisiana sleeper conveyed by the Missouri Pacific Railroad in Houston, Texas. The \"San Francisco Chief\" carried the numbers 1 (westbound) and 2 (eastbound) and was the only Chicago–San Francisco train to make the entire journey on one railroad.\n\nAt the train's inauguration Taptuka, a Hopi chief led the ceremony. The train used a mix of old and new lightweight cars, including full-length dome cars (called \"Big Domes\") built by the Budd Company. There were improved reclining chairs in the coaches, \"classic and popular music...on individual, push-button type receivers,\" and bar service on the upper level of the dome car via a dumb waiter.\n\nThe \"San Francisco Chief\" was one of few Santa Fe trains to survive the purge in 1967–1968, as dozens of trains were discontinued. The discontinuances were prompted in large part by the cancellation of railway post office contracts in 1967. Another survivor, the \"Grand Canyon\", provided through service to Los Angeles at Barstow, California. Amtrak chose the route of \"California Zephyr\" for Chicago–San Francisco service, and the \"San Francisco Chief\" made its last run on April 30, 1971.\n\nThe discontinuance of the \"San Francisco Chief\" was the end of passenger service on the Belen Cutoff. Since 1971 there have been periodic discussions between Amtrak and the owners of that route (Santa Fe, then BNSF Railway) about re-routing the \"Super Chief\", now the \"Southwest Chief\", off the Raton Pass and on the cutoff. However, moving the train from its current route would deprive service to passengers at the Albuquerque and Santa Fe-Lamy stops.\n\nThe \"San Francisco Chief\" was one of several Santa Fe trains to receive the new full-length \"Big Dome\" dome cars from the Budd Company. The upper level of each car seated 57 in chairs and 18 in a lounge area, while the lower level was given over to a bar-lounge. Its sleeping cars and diners were cast-offs from the \"Chief\" and other trains, while some of its coaches (which could seat 48) were new. In 1963–1964 the Santa Fe ordered 24 Hi-Level coaches for use on the \"San Francisco Chief\".\n\nIn 1960 the \"San Francisco Chief\" carried \"chair cars\" (coaches), a \"Big Dome\" dome lounge, a dining car, and sleeping cars. The sleeping cars included sections, roomettes, double bedrooms, compartments, and drawing rooms. The train handled through sleepers from Tulsa, Oklahoma (to Chicago), Lubbock, Texas (to Chicago), and Dallas and Houston (to California) plus a set-out sleeper at Kansas City, Missouri. All chair car seats were reserved.\n\n"}

He performed in jazz band, concert band and orchestra, dabbling between baritone saxophone, bassoon and bass clarinet. Ballou was accepted to join the Hartford School of Music, but he opted to study aerospace engineering instead. His father used to have a guitar that Ballou played occasionally, but it did not interest him until a school friend gave him Slayer tapes around the age of sixteen.\n\nHe is a vegan and follows a straight edge lifestyle.\n\nSince 1990, Kurt Ballou has played in the metalcore band Converge. From 1996 to 2000 Ballou played in the hardcore punk band The Huguenots. From 1996 to 1999 Ballou and Stephen Brodsky played in the rock band Kid Kilowatt. In 1998 Ballou established GodCity Studio.

A dynaset (short for dynamic set) is a set of data that is dynamically linked back to the database. Instead of having the query result stored in a temporary table, where the data cannot be updated directly by the user, the dynaset allows the user to view and update the data contained in the dynaset. Thus, if a university lecturer queried all students who received a distinction in their assignment and found an error in that student's record, they would only need to update the data in the dynaset, which would automatically update the student's database record without the need for them to send a specific update query after storing the query results in a temporary table.\n\nThe concept was initially put forth by Dr. E.F. Codd, the inventor of the relational database management system (RDBMS) concept.\n\n2. A dynaset is a temporary set of data taken from one or more tables in the underlying file.

Created as a department of the CIA in 1948, it actually operated independently until October 1950. OPC existed until 1 August 1952, when it was merged with the Office of Special Operations (OSO) to form the Directorate of Plans (DDP).\n\nOPC was preceded by the Special Procedures Group (SPG), whose creation in March 1948 had been authorized in December 1947 with President Harry Truman's approval of the top-secret policy paper NSC4-A. SPG was located within the CIA's Office of Special Operations (OSO), the CIA department responsible for intelligence collection, and was first used to influence the Italian election of 1948, a policy success which demonstrated that psychological/political warfare could be the key to winning the Cold War. OSO, the successor to the Strategic Services Unit (SSU), was headed by an Assistant Director for Special Operations (ADSO). CIA's expanded mandate caused jealousy in the State Department and the Department of Defense. When OPC was created, it inherited all of SPG's resources, including more than $2 million. It also acquired funds and labor projects from the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA).\n\nOn 18 June 1948, Truman approved NSC10/2 which created the Office of Special Projects. George F. Kennan, the director of the State Department's Policy Planning Staff, was the key figure behind its creation. Before the agency started operating on 1 September 1948 it was renamed to the Office of Policy Coordination. The name change was in anticipation of public scrutiny; the new name would better deflect away attention from the covert activities. Frank Wisner from the State Department was chosen to be the first director.\n\nControl over the new entity was highly contentious. Although formally a department of the CIA, it was responsible to the State Department, and DCI Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter (1947–1950) exercised no authority over the OPC. According to the historian Gregory Mitrovich, OPC effectively \"became an intelligence apparatus for the departments of state and defense\". The OPC was brought under the control of the CIA on 12 October 1950, days after Hillenkoetter was replaced by Walter Bedell Smith, when the new DCI simply announced that he was in charge of the OPC. After taking control over the OPC, Smith became concerned about the size of OPC's covert operations, which had been vastly expanded in accordance with NSC 68. Smith feared that the added responsibility would undermine CIA's primary function, namely the collection of intelligence.\n\nOPC became embroiled in organizational rivalry with OSO, with which there was operational overlap, even though OSO was focused on intelligence collection rather than action. Smith attempted to ameliorate the situation by appointing Allen Dulles on 4 January 1951 to the new position of Deputy Director for Plans (DDP) where he would supervise the two entities. According to Anne Karalekas, a staffer of the Church Committee who wrote a history of the CIA, that was merely a cosmetic change, and it was only on 1 August 1952 that OPC and OSO was properly merged into the Directorate of Plans (DDP). Wisner, who had replaced Allen on 23 August 1951, assumed the command functions of ADSO and ADPC. According to John Prados, the name was intended to disguise its true function.\n\nThe OPC was headed by the Assistant Director for Policy Coordination (ADPC).\n\nPoint 5 of the NSC 10/2 defined the scope of \"covert operations\", which would be overseen by the OPC:\n\nThe OPC grew rapidly during the Korean War. In April 1951, President Truman established the Psychological Strategy Board in order to coordinate all US psychological warfare strategy.\n\nAmongst the propaganda mission the psywar staff carried out was the funding of the 1954 Hollywood production of George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\", which should portray communist domination in an allegorical way.\n\n\n"}

The family moved to the larger Santa Rosa when Kistler was 12, where he first became interested in chemistry. When he entered the College of the Pacific in 1917 however, his plan was to learn to play the cello, then pursue a degree in agriculture. Instead he ended up taking every science course available, and after three years he moved to Stanford University and obtained a B.A. in chemistry, followed by a chemical engineering degree. He never did learn to play the cello. After a brief spell working for the Standard Oil Company of California, he returned to academia, teaching chemistry at the College of the Pacific until 1931, when he transferred to the University of Illinois.\n\nThe exact circumstances of the creation of the first aerogels are not well recorded. A popular story is that they resulted from a competition between Kistler and one Charles Learned \"to see if they could replace the liquid inside of a jelly jar without causing any shrinkage\". Whether these experiments were performed at the College of the Pacific, still with limited facilities following the move in 1923 to the new Stockton campus, or at Stanford where Kistler began pursuing a doctorate in 1927, is a source of some confusion. Either way, in 1931 Kistler published a paper in Nature (vol. 127, p. 741) titled \"Coherent Expanded Aerogels and Jellies\".\n\nHe left his teaching post at the University of Illinois in 1935, and signed a contract with Monsanto Company in the early 1940s to start developing granular silica aerogel products under the trademark \"Santocel\". Largely used as a flattening agent in paints and for similar uses, the line was discontinued by Monsanto in 1970, probably due to the high cost of manufacture and competition from newer products. Kistler had returned to teaching however, taking up a position as Dean of the University of Utah College of Engineering in 1952. He died in Salt Lake City in November 1975, shortly before the resurgence of interest in aerogels caused by the discovery of a less time-consuming method of manufacture by researchers led by Stanislaus Teichner in France.\n"}

Anderson returned as a writer, and filming took place in Mexico with Mulcahy as the director.\n\n\"Resident Evil: Extinction\" was released in the United States on September 21, 2007 and was released in the United Kingdom on October 12, 2007, by Sony Pictures Releasing. The DVD and Blu-ray versions were released in North America on January 1, 2008. The film grossed $149 million against a $45 million budget. A fourth film, \"\", was released in 2010.\n\nAlice wakes up in a mansion. Wandering through its halls, she is forced to escape several security traps. During her escape, Alice makes use of new telekinetic powers, killing a security guard. However, she is eventually killed by a bouncing mine hidden in the floor. Her body is dumped into a pit filled with dozens of Alice clones, representing the failed results of the Umbrella Corporation's ongoing Project Alice.\n\nFollowing Umbrella's attempts to cover up the , the T-Virus spreads around the world, devastating not only the human population, but the entire global environment. The real Alice wanders the wasteland that was once the Southwestern U.S., and after fighting off a family of marauders, discovers information in an abandoned notebook referring to an uninfected area in Alaska. Alice soon realizes that she, like her clones, has developed telekinetic abilities.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Sam Isaacs, the former head of Project Alice and top official at the North American Umbrella facility in Nevada, considers Alice's recapture a top priority due to her ability to bond with the T-virus without mutating. At a meeting of Umbrella executives, Isaacs attempts to persuade Umbrella's board of directors that he can use Alice's blood to develop a treatment that will tame the infected zombies. Isaacs' plan is dismissed by Umbrella CEO Albert Wesker, who orders Isaacs to return to his work with the clones.\n\nSimultaneously, a convoy of survivors led by Claire Redfield and Raccoon City survivors Carlos Oliveira and L.J. Wade travels across the country in search of supplies and safe harbor. While searching a motel, L.J. is bitten by a zombie. Fearing the harsh fate that awaits him, he chooses not to tell the other survivors about the injury. The next morning, the convoy is attacked by a murder of infected crows. With the team nearly overwhelmed, Alice appears and defeats the remaining crows with her newfound telekinesis, though falling unconscious. Awaking shortly thereafter, Alice is introduced to Claire and tells her about the notebook, convincing her to take the convoy to Alaska.\n\nIsaacs' attempts to domesticate the infected lead to the creation of a new zombie breed. Wesker's security officer, Captain Alexander Slater, reports on Isaacs' flagrant disregard for Umbrella regulations. Wesker tasks Slater with watching Isaacs, telling him to kill the scientist if he disobeys orders again. Tracing an energy pattern sent out by Alice's telekinesis, Umbrella triangulates her location. Desperate to reclaim Alice for the sake of achieving his goals, Dr. Isaacs sends his new zombies to ambush the convoy against Wesker's specific orders. During the attack, most of the convoy is killed, and L.J. succumbs to his infection, biting Carlos. Umbrella tries to shut Alice down remotely, but she breaks free from Umbrella's programming and continues to fight. She finds Isaacs at the scene, and he is bitten as he flees via helicopter. Alice and K-Mart use Isaacs' computer to track the helicopter's flight path, leading them to Umbrella's underground facility.\n\nThe convoy approaches Umbrella's facility, which is surrounded by thousands of zombies. Carlos sacrifices himself by plowing his truck into the zombie mob, blowing the rig apart and giving both Alice and Claire time to load survivors into the helicopter. Following the rescue, Alice decides to stay behind. Under Wesker's orders, Slater and a group of Umbrella commandos take control of Isaacs' lab, where he's injected himself with massive doses of anti-virus in an attempt to counteract his infection. Slater shoots him, triggering a mutation that transforms Isaacs into the monstrous Tyrant. Though he retains his intelligence, Isaacs kills Slater along with everyone else in the facility, ultimately finding himself trapped in the lab's lower levels.\n\nApproaching the scene, Alice meets a holograph of the Red Queen's \"sister\" AI, the White Queen. She informs Alice that her blood can cure the T-virus, defends the Red Queen's prior actions, and reveals what happened to Dr. Isaacs. On her way to the lab's lower levels, Alice encounters one of her clones, which awakens but appears to die from shock soon after. Alice discovers Isaacs/Tyrant, defeating him after leading him to the replica of The Hive's laser corridor featured in the film's opening. Just as Alice is about to meet the same fate, the system is deactivated by the clone, who is still alive.\n\nLater in Tokyo, Wesker informs his fellow Umbrella executives that the North American facility has been lost. Alice appears during the meeting, declaring that she and her \"friends\" (the other clones) are coming for him.\n\n\n\"Resident Evil: Extinction\" was first discussed by \"Resident Evil\" franchise writer Paul W. S. Anderson after \"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\" opened at number 1 on the US box office in 2004, earning more than $23.7 million dollars on its opening weekend. Anderson told SciFi Wire that he would like to oversee a third installment, under the original title of \"Resident Evil: Afterlife\". Shortly after, the film and another planned sequel were officially announced by Sony Screen Gems on June 13, 2005.\n\nOn November 7, 2005, Davis Film, Constantin Film and Screen Gems announced their distribution rights worldwide with the film's title being changed from \"\" to \"Resident Evil: Extinction\". Impressed with Russell Mulcahy's work on \"Highlander\", \"\", \"The Shadow\" and \"Ricochet\", Anderson signed Mulcahy on as director, stating, \"Russell pioneered a very distinct visual style, a lot of moving camera and crane work, lots of very fast cutting. He’s got a very cool eye and sees great ways to shoot. His work certainly had a big influence on me as a filmmaker and that’s why I was very excited to work with him on this movie.\"\n\nOn June 12, 2005, Milla Jovovich was announced to reprise her role as the heroine Alice. In an interview with BlackFilm.com on September 9, 2005, Mike Epps confirmed that he would be reprising his role from \"\" as L.J. Wayne, noting that \"Black people die in these movies and [Anderson] was like, 'Well Mike, I kinda like you.' So then I asked him, 'Are you setting me up to die because if there's a fourth movie, I'm as good as dead.'\" Sienna Guillory was planned to reprise her role as Jill Valentine; however, she passed on the role, citing commitments to \"Eragon\". On May 9, 2006, Oded Fehr was confirmed to reprise his role of Carlos Oliveira, as well as Iain Glen, Spencer Locke and Ashanti Douglas who were added to the cast. It was rumored that Debra Marshall was originally cast as Cindy Lennox. However, it was proven to be only a rumor. Chris Redfield was rumored to appear in the film portrayed by Australian actor Charlie Clausen and Leon S. Kennedy was also rumored to be played by Jensen Ackles.\n\nThe film's story takes place in Death Valley, where the large scale action sequences take place amid post-apocalyptic landscapes of Las Vegas in broad daylight. Drawing inspirations from western films and post-apocalyptic movies, including the \"Mad Max\" series, \"Extinction\" manages to reference such predecessors, with plot elements revolving around the shortage of oil, the shortage of supplies, a convoy traveling across a desert, and the desert taking over civilized land.\n\nAnderson stated that the film's story is original and unfolds in a world that fans of the game recognize: \"It's all part of trying to deliver a movie-going experience that satisfies the fans of the game but also provides a fun cinematic experience for a broader audience that has never played a \"Resident Evil\" game.\" The story takes place five years after the events of \"\". While previous installments in the series had minor changes to plot and characters, \"Extinction\" branches completely away from the video game series as evidenced by the fact that \"Resident Evil 4\" takes place six years after the events portrayed in \"Resident Evil 2\" and the world has not become overrun with zombies. References to \"\" are made, such as the replica mansion and the viral outbreak itself. A common element used throughout each \"Resident Evil\" film is the climactic battle which occurs in the finale. \"Extinction\" marked the first appearance of herbs, a healing item in the video game series, as seen in Dr. Isaac's lab, and it also referenced the first film with the inclusion of a replica Hive facility designed after the one in Raccoon City, the Raccoon City Hospital, a holographic computer database known as the White Queen, and the replica Spencer Mansion.\n\nNumerous references to the video game series have been made, including zombies being unleashed through a T-virus mutation. While the concept of the undead remains the same, this film includes \"Super Undead\". As Anderson explains, these are \"a result of Umbrella experimenting with the Undead and attempting to give them back some of their reasoning power, some of their intelligence and a little of their humanity. Unfortunately, these experiments don't quite work and the side effect is the Super Undead, which are Undead that are faster, stronger and [a] more cunning foe.\" Other creatures from the video game series have also made appearances in the film, including the Tyrant, a swarm of crows, and a pack of Dobermans (although Belgian Shepherd Dogs were used during production).\n\nTwo main characters were added to the film's cast: Albert Wesker (portrayed by Jason O'Mara) and Claire Redfield (portrayed by Ali Larter) from \"Resident Evil 2\".\n\nHorror magazine \"Fangoria\" featured the film in its August 2007 issue and also on the cover of its September 2007 issue, talking with director Russell Mulcahy. The following details reported were inaccurate, possibly indicating to a change in the storyline:\n\n\"Resident Evil: Extinction\" began principal photography in Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico in May 2006 after filming locations had to be changed from the Australian Outback to Mexico, causing production dates to be pushed back repeatedly from November 2005 to May 2006. Numerous sets were designed by production designer Eugenio Caballero including Umbrella's underground laboratory, the Las Vegas Strip, the New York-New York Hotel & Casino, Paris Las Vegas, Realto Ponte, Luxor Hotel and the replica of the Spencer Mansion. The film entered post-production in late July 2006 with details about production being kept secret and with the film's special effects being covered by Tatopoulos Studios and Mr. X Inc., whom both worked on the 2006 film \"Silent Hill\".\n\nIn late June 2006, Sony released the film's first two production stills which included Alice wearing a costume designed by her fashion company Jovovich-Hawk and Claire Redfield.\n\nThe film's teaser trailer was shown with \"Ghost Rider\" on February 16, 2007, and was structured in the same manner of the \"Regenerate\" teaser trailer for \"Apocalypse\". The film's website was launched by Sony on February 17, 2007 with confirmation of its September 21, 2007 release date.\n\nThe film's teaser poster was leaked onto the internet via a fansite in May 2007, before appearing on IGN, whereas a German website leaked concept art for \"Extinction\" including vehicle and numerous set designs. The film's theatrical trailer premiered on Yahoo! Movies in late July 2007, with NBC releasing several scenes including the crow attack sequence. The social networking website Myspace also featured numerous clips of four of the main characters—Claire Redfield, Carlos Oliveira, Nurse Betty, and Alice. The official website for \"Extinction\" launched an online game titled \"Resident Evil: Extinction – Online Convoy Game\" in August 2007. On September 12, 2007 Sony released numerous promotional clips and television spots and on September 17, 2007 the was released, whereas the was released on December 18, 2007.\n\nOn July 31, 2007, a full two months before the film's release, a novelization by Keith R. A. DeCandido was published. At 368 pages, it is the longest of all of the \"Resident Evil\" novels. DeCandido also wrote the novelizations of the first (subtitled as \"Genesis\") and films.\n\n\"Resident Evil: Extinction\" was released on DVD, UMD, and high-definition Blu-ray Disc in North America on January 1, 2008. A Blu-ray release of the \"Resident Evil\" trilogy, featuring the three films in one package was also released on January 1. A 3-disc DVD set of the \"Resident Evil\" trilogy was also made available in 2008. Milla Jovovich and Oded Fehr filmed a commentary while Jovovich was pregnant, which Fehr expects to be shown \"in a little square box in the corner\" of the Blu-ray version. The DVD and Blu-ray versions of the film showed previews for \"\", a trailer of \"Devil May Cry 4\", and a video of \"Resident Evil 5\". \"Resident Evil: Extinction\" was released on DVD in Australia on February 13, 2008 and in the UK on the February 18, 2008.\n\nThe film was the number one movie at the North American box office on its opening weekend, grossing $23 million in 2,828 theaters, averaging $8,372 per theater. As of January 1, 2008, the film had grossed $50,648,679 domestically and $97 million internationally for a worldwide total of $148.4 million.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes it currently has a 24% based on 99 reviews, with an average rating of 4.33/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"\"Resident Evil: Extinction\" is more of the same; its few impressive action sequences unable to compensate for the pedestrian plot.\" On Metacritic it has score of 41 out of 100, based on reviews from 12 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B- on scale of A to F.\n\nSteven Hyden of \"The Onion\"′s A.V. Club said that \"the movie delivers some simple-minded thrills\" and praised the \"solidly effective killer-ravens sequence\" but felt the film was too predictable, saying: \"Anybody who has ever seen a zombie movie can figure out what happens next. Somebody will get bit without telling the others, which will inevitably backfire. Survivors will be forced to shoot suddenly undead friends in the head. One of them dastardly science folk will protect the monsters in order to study them, which will also inevitably backfire. And legions of undead will be re-killed in surprisingly easy fashion.\"\n\nKevin Crust of \"The Los Angeles Times\" praised the film, saying that \"the story and characters are surprisingly engaging, with fight scenes and scares effectively placed between plot turns\" although he felt that the ending was too \"open-ended\".\nKyle Smith of the \"New York Post\" gave \"Extinction\" half a star out of a possible four, saying that the film was \"no more interesting than watching someone else play with his Playstation\".\nScott Brown of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said that \"Extinction\" \"plays like a flabby middle chapter, full of nerdy details but fraudulently short on the ruined Vegas-scape that ads have been promising.\" Jack Mathews of the \"New York Daily News\" gave the film a score of one and a half stars out of five, calling the action scenes \"monotonous\" and urging audiences to \"flee this yawn of the dead.\"\nHelen O'Hara of \"Empire\" gave \"Extinction\" a score of 4 out of five, saying that the film was \"better than \"\"\" and had \"an effectively creepy empty world setting\".\"\n\nFrank Scheck says that as the film is \"fast-paced and filled with brisk action sequences\", it should \"reasonably satisfy the devotees.\" Maitland McDonagh of \"TV Guide\" gave the film a score of two and a half stars out of four, saying: \"Equal parts \"Mad Max\" and \"Day of the Dead\", [\"Extinction\"] is no less derivative than its predecessors but moves along at a brisk clip.\" Pete Vonder Haar of Film Threat gave \"Extinction\" a score of three out of five, saying that the film had \"rather lazy pacing\" but added that \"the way Anderson keeps upping the ante with regard to Alice's ultimate fate continues to amuse.\"\n\nA common complaint was the noticeable digital airbrushing on many close-up shots of Jovovich's face, for which reviewers were confused at the use of, or found unnecessary. The film won the Golden Trailer Award for Best Action Poster and was nominated for Best TV Spot.\n\n"}

It is famous mostly for its long natural sandy beach, and it is infamous for the largest refugee camp of the world. It is located south of the divisional headquarter city of Chittagong. Cox's Bazar is also known by the name \"Panowa,\" which translates literally as \"yellow flower\". Another old name was \"Palongkee\".\n\nThe modern Cox's Bazar derives its name from Captain Hiram Cox, an officer of the British East India Company, a Superintendent of Palongkee outpost. To commemorate his role in refugee rehabilitation work, a market was established and named after him.\n\nThe municipality covers an area of with 27 mahallas and 9 wards and as of 2012 had a population of 51,918. Cox's Bazar is connected by road and air with Chittagong.\n\nFrom the early 9th century the greater Chittagong area, including Cox's Bazar, was under the rule of Arakan kings until its conquest by the Mughals in 1666 AD. When the Mughal Prince Shah Shuja was passing through the hilly terrain of the present-day Cox's Bazar on his way to Arakan, he was attracted to its scenic and captivating beauty. He commanded his forces to camp there. His retinue of one thousand palanquins stopped there for some time. A place named \"Dulahazara,\" meaning \"one thousand palanquins,\" still exists in the area.\nAfter the Mughals, the place came under the control of the Tipras and the Arakanese, followed by the Portuguese and then the British.\n\nThe name Cox's Bazar originated from the name of a British East India Company officer, Captain Hiram Cox, who was appointed as the Superintendent of Palonki (today's Cox's Bazar) outpost. He succeeded Warren Hastings, who became the Governor of Bengal following the British East India Company Act in 1773. Cox embarked upon the task of rehabilitation and settlement of the Arakanese refugees in the area. He rehabilitated many refugees in the area, but died in 1799 before finishing his work. To commemorate him, a market was established and named after him, called Cox's Bazar. Cox's Bazar was first established in 1854 and became a municipality in 1869.\n\nAfter the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857, the British East India Company was highly criticised on humanitarian grounds, specially for its opium trade monopoly over the Indian Sub-Continent. However, after its dissolution on 1 January 1874, the company's assets, including its armed forces, were acquired by the British Crown. After this takeover, Cox's Bazar was declared a district of the Bengal Province under the British Crown.\n\nAfter the end of British rule in 1947, Cox's Bazar became part of East Pakistan. Captain Advocate Fazlul Karim, the first post-independence chairman of Cox's Bazar Municipality, established the Tamarisk Forest along the beach. He wanted to attract tourists as well as to protect the beach from tsunamis. He donated much of his father-in-law's and his own lands as sites for constructing a public library and a town hall. Karim was inspired to build Cox's Bazar as a tourist spot after seeing beaches of Bombay and Karachi, and was a resort pioneer in developing Cox's Bazar as a destination. Karim established a maternity hospital, the stadium and the drainage system by procuring grants from the Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation through correspondence. T. H. Matthews, the principal of the Dacca Engineering College (1949~1954), was a friend who had helped him in these fundraising efforts. Engineer Chandi Charan Das was the government civil engineer who worked on all these projects. \n\nIn 1959 the municipality was turned into a town committee.\n\nIn 1961 the Geological Survey of Pakistan initiated investigation of radioactive minerals like monazite around the Cox's Bazar sea-beach area.\n\nIn 1971, Cox's Bazar wharf was used as a naval port by the Pakistan Navy's gunboats. This and the nearby airstrip of the Pakistan Air Force were the scene of intense shelling by the Indian Navy during the Bangladesh Liberation War. During the war, Pakistani soldiers killed many people in the town, including eminent lawyer Jnanendralal Chowdhury. The killing of two freedom fighters named Farhad and Subhash at Badar Mokam is also recorded in history.\n\nAfter Bangladesh's independence, Cox's Bazar started to receive administrative attention. In 1972 the town committee of Cox's Bazar was once again turned into a municipality. In 1975, The Government of Bangladesh established a pilot plant at Kalatali. In 1984, Cox's Bazar subdivision was promoted to a district, and five years later (in 1989) the Cox's Bazar municipality was elevated to B-grade. In 1994 (jobs) the Marine Fisheries and Technology Station (MFTS) was established at Cox's Bazar. MFTS is a research station of Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (BFRI) headquartered in Mymensingh. The station covers a land area of four hectares and contains five laboratories.\nIn September 2012 the municipality was the site of the Cox's Bazar and Ramu riots, where local Muslims attacked the Buddhist community over an alleged Quran desecration posted to Facebook.\n\nIn 2017, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Myanmar arrived in Cox’s Bazar, amounting to 725,000 in October 2018, making it the largest refugee camp in the world. \nOn May 14, 2020, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was detected among the 860,000 Rohingya refugees which lived in Cox’s Bazar district.\n\nCox's Bazar is located south of the divisional headquarter city of Chittagong.Cox's Bazar town has an area of , and is bounded by Bakkhali River on the north and East, Bay of Bengal in the West, and Jhilwanj Union in the south.\n\nThe beach in Cox's Bazar has a gentle slope and with an unbroken length of it is often termed the \"longest natural unbroken sea beach\" in the world.\n\nThe climate of Bangladesh is mostly determined by its location in the tropical monsoon region: high temperature, heavy rainfall, and generally excessive humidity, with distinct seasonal variations. The climate of Cox's Bazar is mostly similar to the rest of the country. It is further characterised by the location in the coastal area.

Oysters, snails, pearls and their ornaments are very popular with tourists and people are involved in the transportation business for tourists. \n\nPeople are involved in fishing and collecting seafood and sea products for their livelihood.\nCox's Bazar is one of the few major spots for aquaculture in Bangladesh. Along with Khulna, it is considered a major source of revenue from foreign exchanges. Besides a mix of small-scale agriculture, marine and inland fishing and salt production are other industrial sources that play important roles in the national economy.\n\nIn April 2007, as Bangladesh was connected to the submarine cable network as a member of the SEA-ME-WE-4 Consortium, Cox's Bazar was selected as the landing station of the submarine cable. \n\nThe beach in Cox's Bazar is the main attraction of the town with an unbroken length of also termed the \"longest natural unbroken sea beach\" in the world.

Leyendecker\n\nJoseph Christian Leyendecker (March 23, 1874 – July 25, 1951) was a German-American illustrator. He is considered to be one of the preeminent American illustrators of the early 20th century. He is best known for his poster, book and advertising illustrations, the trade character known as The Arrow Collar Man, and his numerous covers for \"The Saturday Evening Post\". Between 1896 and 1950, Leyendecker painted more than 400 magazine covers. During the Golden Age of American Illustration, for \"The Saturday Evening Post\" alone, J. C. Leyendecker produced 322 covers, as well as many advertisement illustrations for its interior pages. No other artist, until the arrival of Norman Rockwell two decades later, was so solidly identified with one publication. Leyendecker \"virtually invented the whole idea of modern magazine design.\"\n\nJoseph Christian Leyendecker ('J.C.' or 'Joe') was born on March 23, 1874, at Montabaur in western Germany, a tiny village 18km east of the Rhine, to Peter Leyendecker (1838–1916) and Elizabeth Ortseifen Leyendecker (1845–1905). Joseph was the first-born son, and his brother Francis Xavier was born three years later. A sister, Mary Augusta, the third and last child, arrived after the family emigrated to America.\n\nIn 1882, the Leyendecker family immigrated to Chicago, Illinois, where Elizabeth's brother Adam Ortseifen was Vice president of the successful McAvoy Brewing Company. After working in late adolescence for a Chicago engraving firm, J. Manz & Company, and completing his first commercial commission of 60 Bible illustrations for the Powers Brothers Company, J. C. sought formal artistic training at the school of the Chicago Art Institute.\n\nIn 1895 the April-September issue of Inland Printer had an introduction to J.C. Leyendecker. The article described his work for J. Manz & Company as well as his intention to study in Paris. The article also featured a sketch and two book covers he had illustrated. The book covers were provided courtesy of E.A. Weeks. E.A. Weeks was a Chicago Publisher between 1893 and 1899. In this same year, J.C. Leyendecker created his first poster. It was also for E.A. Weeks. The poster was for the book One Fair Daughter by Frank Frankfort Moore. \n\nAfter studying drawing and anatomy under John H. Vanderpoel at the Chicago Art Institute, J. C. and younger brother Frank enrolled in the Académie Julian in Paris for a year, where they were exposed to the work of Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules Chéret, and also Alphonse Mucha, a leader in the French Art Nouveau movement.\n\nIn 1899, the Leyendecker brothers returned to America and set up residence in an apartment in Hyde Park, Illinois. They had a studio in Chicago's Fine Arts Building at 410 South Michigan Ave. On May 20 of that year, Joe received his first commission for a \"Saturday Evening Post\" cover – the beginning of his forty-four-year association with the most popular magazine in the country. Ultimately he would produce 322 covers for the magazine, introducing many iconic visual images and traditions including the New Year's Baby, the pudgy red-garbed rendition of Santa Claus, flowers for Mother's Day, and firecrackers on the 4th of July.\nIn 1900, Joe, Frank, and their sister Mary moved to New York City, then the center of the US commercial art, advertising and publishing industries. During the next decade, both brothers began lucrative long-term working relationships with apparel manufactures including Interwoven Socks, Hartmarx, B. Kuppenheimer & Co., and Cluett Peabody & Company. The latter resulted in Leyendecker's most important commission when he was hired to develop a series of images of the Arrow brand of shirt collars. Leyendecker's Arrow Collar Man, as well as the images he later created for Kuppenheimer Suits and Interwoven Socks, came to define the fashionable American male during the early decades of the twentieth century. Leyendecker often used his favorite model and partner Charles Beach (1881–1954).\n\nAnother important commission for Leyendecker was from Kellogg's, the breakfast food manufacturer. As part of a major advertising campaign, he created a series of twenty \"Kellogg's Kids\" to promote Kellogg's Corn Flakes.\n\nIn 1914, the Leyendeckers, accompanied by Charles Beach, moved into a large home and art studio in New Rochelle, New York, where J. C. would reside for the remainder of his life. During the first World War, in addition to his many commissions for magazine covers and men's fashion advertisements, J. C. also painted recruitment posters for the United States military and the war effort.\n\nThe 1920s were in many ways the apex of Leyendecker's career, with some of his most recognizable work being completed during this time. Modern advertising had come into its own, with Leyendecker widely regarded as among the preeminent American commercial artists. This popularity extended beyond the commercial, and into Leyendecker's personal life, where he and Charles Beach hosted large galas attended by people of consequence from all sectors. The parties they hosted at their New Rochelle home/studio were important social and celebrity making events.\nAs the 1920s marked the apex of J. C. Leyendecker's career, so the 1930s marked the beginning of its decline. Around 1930–31, Cluett, Peabody, & Co. ceased using Leyendecker's illustrations in its advertisements for shirts and ties as the collar industry seriously declined after 1921. During this time, the always shy Leyendecker became more and more reclusive, rarely speaking with people outside of his sister Mary Augusta and Charles (Frank had died in 1924 as a result of an addiction-riddled lifestyle). Perhaps in reaction to his pervasive popularity in the previous decade, or as a result of the new economic reality following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the number of commissions Leyendecker received steadily declined. In 1936, the editor at the \"Saturday Evening Post\" for all of Leyendecker's career up to that point, George Horace Lorimer, retired, and was replaced by Wesley Winans Stout (1937–1942) and then Ben Hibbs (1942–1962), both of whom rarely commissioned Leyendecker to illustrate covers.\n\nLeyendecker's last cover for the \"Saturday Evening Post\" was of a New Year Baby for January 2, 1943, thus ending the artist's most lucrative and celebrated string of commissions. New commissions continued to filter in, but slowly. Among the most prominent were posters for the United States Department of War, in which Leyendecker depicted commanding officers of the armed forces encouraging the purchases of bonds to support the nation's efforts in World War II.\n\nLeyendecker died on July 25, 1951, at his estate in New Rochelle of an acute coronary occlusion.\n\nMany biographers have speculated on J. C. Leyendecker's sexuality, often attributing the apparent homoerotic aesthetic of his work to a homosexual identity. Without question, Leyendecker excelled at depicting male homosocial spaces (locker rooms, clubhouses, tailoring shops) and extraordinarily handsome young men in curious poses or exchanging glances. Leyendecker never married, and he lived with another man, Charles Beach, for much of his adult life. Beach was the original model for the famous Arrow Collar Man and is assumed to have been his lover. \n\nWhile Beach often organized the famous gala-like social gatherings that Leyendecker was known for in the 1920s, he apparently also contributed largely to Leyendecker's social isolation in his later years. Beach reportedly forbade outside contact with the artist in the last months of his life.\n\nDue to his fame as an illustrator, Leyendecker was able to indulge in a very luxurious lifestyle which in many ways embodied the decadence of the Roaring Twenties. However, when commissions began to wane in the 1930s, he was forced to curtail spending considerably. By the time of his death, Leyendecker had let all of the household staff at his New Rochelle estate go, with he and Beach attempting to maintain the extensive estate themselves. Leyendecker left a tidy estate equally split between his sister and Beach.\n\nLeyendecker is buried alongside parents and brother Frank at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City. Charles Allwood Beach died of a heart attack on 21 June 1954 at New Rochelle. The exact location of his burial is unknown. Although the register for St. Paul's Church, New Rochelle, indicates internment at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York, the cemetery has no record of the burial.\n\nExamples of his work can be found in the collections of the Haggin Museum in Stockton, CA, the National Museum of American Illustration and the Grace Vanderbilt in Newport, RI, and in the Pritzker Military Museum & Library in Chicago, IL.\n\nAs the premier cover illustrator for the enormously popular \"Saturday Evening Post\" for much of the first half of the 20th century, Leyendecker's work both reflected and helped mold many of the visual aspects of the era's culture in America. The mainstream image of Santa Claus as a jolly fat man in a red fur-trimmed coat was popularized by Leyendecker, as was the image of the New Year Baby. The tradition of giving flowers as a gift on Mother's Day was started by Leyendecker's May 30, 1914 \"Saturday Evening Post\" cover depicting a young bellhop carrying hyacinths. It was created as a commemoration of President Woodrow Wilson's declaration of Mother's Day as an official holiday that year.\n\nLeyendecker was a chief influence upon, and friend of, Norman Rockwell, who was a pallbearer at Leyendecker's funeral. In particular, the early work of Norman Rockwell for the \"Saturday Evening Post\" bears a strong superficial resemblance to that of Leyendecker. While today it is generally accepted that Norman Rockwell established the best-known visual images of Americana, in many cases they are derivative of Leyendecker's work, or reinterpretations of visual themes established by Rockwell's idol.\n\nThe visual style of Leyendecker's art inspired the graphics in \"The Dagger of Amon Ra\", a video game, as well as designs in \"Team Fortress 2\", a first-person shooter for the PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.\n\nLeyendecker's work inspired George Lucas and will be part of the collection of the anticipated Lucas Museum of Narrative Art.\n\n\"In Love with the Arrow Collar Man\", a play written by Lance Ringel and directed by Chuck Muckle at Theatre 80 St. Marks from November to December 2017, dramatizes the life of Leyendecker and his life partner Charles Beach.\n\n\n\n"}

Sayle is seen traversing the country on a moped in a vague attempt to catalogue and comprehend all the \"stuff\" about him. The style of humour is often surreal and blunt. The bulk of the content was written by Sayle himself, with Andrew Marshall and David Renwick. Additional material was contributed by longtime collaborator David Stafford and comedian and promoter Huw David Thomas. Although Sayle's humour in the programme covers many bases, politics is always a favourite target: \"Recently I had to get married, 'cos I got my girlfriend into trouble - got her involved in the civil war in Angola.\" Various episodes also feature sketches based around BBC2 presentation, including satirical continuity announcers and faux trailers; this humour is similar to Kenny Everett's jokes towards Thames Television and later, BBC1.\nAt the beginning of series 2, in a sequence spoofing the creation of Disney's Mickey Mouse, a sketch reveals that Alexei Sayle is in fact a cartoon character. Viewers are shown a short extract from Sayle's very first animated appearance from 50 years previously, named \"Steamboat Fatty\" (spoofing \"Steamboat Willie\", the first Mickey Mouse cartoon), as well as Mouseketeer-esque children dancing around wearing bald wigs. An edited version of this sketch became the title sequence for series 2.\n\nSeries 1's titles feature a handsome young man arriving at BBC Television Centre to the accompaniment of Dion's hit \"The Wanderer\", with prosthetic make-up and padding being applied to change his appearance to that of Alexei Sayle, followed by a BBC receptionist uttering the phrase \"Who is that fat bastard?\" which was to become the show's catch-phrase. Series 3's title sequence is a pastiche of Zorro, the theme song being sung mariachi style (\"\"This fat renegade / Carves a 'B' with his blade / A 'B' that stands for 'Bastard'.\"\")\n\nOne episode in series 2 begins with a lengthy cold open of an initially straight scene from \"Juliet Bravo\" featuring actress Anna Carteret. Viewers are fooled into believing that the first few minutes of the programme are a \"Juliet Bravo\" episode, the illusion being broken only when one of her male colleagues appears not to \"know what a woman is\". Similar blending and bending of the boundaries of TV formats continues throughout the series.\n\n\nThree complete episodes were included in separate editions of the \"BBC Video World\", a fortnightly subscription-only service - primarily for expatriates - that delivered a three-hour selection of BBC programming on video tape:\n\n\nA VHS video entitled \"The Best of Alexei Sayle's Stuff\" was released by the BBC in 1990 featuring selected clips from the first two series.\n\nSeries 1 was released on Region 2 DVD by 2entertain in 2005. Series 2 and Series 3 were both released on Region-2 DVDs by the same firm in 2006. Each release was a single-disc edition containing the complete series, and no extra content. Only Series 2 was released on Region 4 DVD. As is common practice, certain sketches were omitted or truncated on the DVD releases, likely due to music licensing rights, or copyright issues. This included the removal of all of the linked \"Michelin Film Awards\" sketches from Series 2#2, which were complete on the \"BBC Video World\" release.\n\n\"Alexei Sayle's Stuff\" was a critical success and a prelude to his 1994 series \"The All New Alexei Sayle Show\", which was remarkably similar in content and was likewise followed by \"Alexei Sayle's Merry-Go-Round\" in 1998.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2271241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271241", "title": "University of Lviv", "text": "University of Lviv\n\nThe University of Lviv (, , , briefly known as the \"Theresianum\" in the early 19th-century), presently the Ivan Franko National University of Lviv () is the oldest university in Ukraine, dating from 1661 when the Polish King, John II Casimir, granted it its first royal charter. Over the centuries it underwent transformations, suspensions and name changes that reflected the geo-political complexities of this part of Europe. The present institution can be dated to 1940. It is located in the historic city of Lviv in Lviv Oblast of Western Ukraine. \n\nThe university was founded on January 20, 1661, when King John II Casimir of Poland granted a charter to the city's Jesuit Collegium, founded in 1608, giving it \"the honour of an academy and the title of a university\". The Jesuits had tried to found a university earlier, in 1589, but did not succeed. Establishing another seat of learning in the Kingdom of Poland was seen as a threat by the authorities of Kraków's Jagiellonian University, which did not want a rival and which for many years managed to stymy the Jesuits' plans.\n\nAccording to the Treaty of Hadiach (1658), an Orthodox Ruthenian academy was to be created in Kiev and another one in an unspecified location. The Jesuits suspected that it would be established in Lwów/Lviv on the foundations of the Orthodox Brotherhood's school, and used this as a pretext for obtaining a royal mandate that elevated their own college to the status of an academy (no city could have two academies). King John II Casimir was a supporter of the Jesuits and his stance was crucial. The original royal charter was subsequently confirmed by another decree issued in Częstochowa on February 5, 1661.\n\nIn 1758 King Augustus III issued a decree, which described the Collegium as an academy, equal in fact status to the Jagiellonian University, with two faculties, those of Theology and Philosophy.\n\nIn 1772 the city of Lwów was annexed by Austria (see: Partitions of Poland). Its German name was Lemberg and hence that of the university. In 1773 the Suppression of the Society of Jesus by Rome (Dominus ac Redemptor) was soon followed by the partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth which meant that the university was excluded from the Commission of National Education reform. It was renamed \"Theresianum\" by the Austrians, i.e. a State Academy. On 21 October 1784 the Austrian Emperor Joseph II signed an act of foundation of a secular university. He began to Germanise the institution by bringing German-speaking professors from the various parts of the empire. The university now had four faculties. To theology and philosophy were added those of law and medicine. Latin was the official language of the university, with Polish and German as auxiliary. Literary Slaveno-Rusyn (Ruthenian/Ukrainian) of the period had been used in the Studium Ruthenum (1787–1809), a special institute of the university for educating candidates for the Uniate (Greek-Catholic) priesthood.\n\nIn 1805 the university was closed, as Austria, then involved in the Napoleonic wars, did not have sufficient funds to support it. Instead, it operated as a high school. The university was reopened in 1817. Officially Vienna described it as an \"act of mercy\", but the actual reasons were different. The Austrian government was aware of the pro-Polish stance of the Russian Emperor Alexander I and the Austrians wanted to challenge it. However, the quality of the university's education was not considered high. Latin was replaced by German and most professors were mediocre. The few good ones regarded their stay in Lemberg as a springboard to other centres.\n\nIn 1848, when the pan-European revolution reached Lemberg (see: Revolutions of 1848), students of the university created two organizations: \"The Academic Legion\" and \"the Academic Committee\" both of which demanded that the university be polonized. The government in Vienna answered with force, and on November 2, 1848, the centre of the city was shelled by the troops led by General Hammerstein striking the buildings of the university, especially its library. A curfew was called and the university was temporarily closed. A major demand for Ukrainians was the education of teachers and promotion of Ukrainian culture through Ukrainian courses at the university and to this end a committee for the Defense of Ukrainian Education was created.\n\nIt was reopened in January 1850, with only limited autonomy. After a few years the Austrians relented and on July 4, 1871 Vienna declared Polish and Ruthenian (Ukrainian) as the official languages at the university. Eight years later this was changed. The Austrian authorities declared Polish as the main teaching medium with Ruthenian and German as auxiliary. Examinations in the two latter languages were possible as long as the professors used them. This move created unrest among the Ruthenians (Ukrainians), who were demanding equal rights. In 1908, a Ruthenian student of the philosophy faculty, Miroslaw Siczynski, had assassinated the Polish governor of Galicia, Andrzej Potocki.\n\nMeanwhile, the University of Lemberg thrived, being one of two Polish language universities in Galicia, the other one was the Jagiellonian University in Kraków. Its professors were famous across Europe, with such renowned names as Wladyslaw Abraham, Oswald Balzer, Szymon Askenazy, Stanislaw Zakrzewski, Zygmunt Janiszewski, Kazimierz Twardowski, Benedykt Dybowski, Marian Smoluchowski and Ludwik Rydygier.\n\nIn the 1870s Ivan Franko studied at Lemberg University. He entered the world history as a well-known Ukrainian scholar, public figure, writer and translator. In 1894, the newly founded Chair of World History and the History of Eastern Europe was headed by Professor Mykhailo Hrushevskyi (1866–1934), an outstanding scholar of Ukrainian History, founder of the Ukrainian Historical School, and author of the ten-volume \"History of Ukraine-Rus'\", hundreds of works on History, History of Literature, Historiography, and Source Studies. In 1904, a special summer course in Ukrainian studies was organized in Lviv, primarily for Eastern Ukrainian students. \n\nThe number of students grew from 1,732 in 1897 to 3,582 in 1906. Poles made up around 75% of the students, Ukrainians 20%, other nationalities 5%.\nIn mid-December 1910, Ukrainian women students at Lviv University established a Student Union's women's branch, their twenty members meeting regularly to discuss current affairs. In July 1912, they met with their Jewish counterpart branch to discuss the representation of women in the student body of the university.\n\nDuring the Interbellum period, the region was part of the Second Polish Republic and the university was known as \"Jan Kazimierz University\" (since 1919), , in honour of its founder, King John II Casimir Vasa. The decision to name the school after the king was taken by the government of Poland on November 22, 1919.\n\nJan Kazimierz University was the third biggest academic center in the country after the University of Warsaw and the Jagiellonian University in Kraków. On February 26, 1920, the university was rehoused by the Polish government in the building formerly used by the Sejm of the Land, which has since been the university's main location. Its first rector during the Second Polish Republic was the famous poet, Jan Kasprowicz.\n\nIn 1924 the Philosophy Faculty was divided into Humanities and Mathematics and Biology Departments, thus there were now five faculties. In the 1934/35 academic year, the breakdown of the student body was as follows:\n\nAltogether, during the academic year 1934/35, there were 5900 students at the university, consisting by religious observance of:\n\nUkrainian professors were required to take a formal oath of allegiance to Poland; most of them refused and left the university in the early 1920s. The principle of \"Numerus clausus\" had been introduced after which Ukrainian applicants were discriminated against – Ukrainian applications were capped at 15% of the intake, whereas Poles enjoyed a 50% quota at the time.\n\nIn 1939, after the German invasion of Poland and the accompanying Soviet invasion, the Soviet administration permitted classes to continue. Until late 1939, the school worked in the pre-war Polish system. On October 18, however, the Polish rector, Professor Roman Longchamps de Bérier, was dismissed, and was replaced by a prominent Ukrainian historian, Mykhailo Marchenko, grandfather of Ukrainian journalist and dissident Valeriy Marchenko. Marchenko was determined to transform Jan Kazimierz University into the Ukrainian Soviet University. On January 8, 1940, the university was renamed \"Ivan Franko Lviv State University\". Polish professors and administrative assistants were increasingly fired and replaced by Ukrainians or Russians, specializing in Marxism, Leninism, political economics, as well as Ukrainian and Soviet literature, history and geography. This was accompanied by the closing of departments seen as related with the religion, free-market economics, capitalism, or the West in general; this included Polish geography, literature, or history. Lectures were held in Ukrainian and Polish (as auxiliary). From 1939 to 1941, the Soviets also executed over a dozen members of the Polish faculty.\n\nIn July 1941 the Nazi German occupiers closed the university, followed by the massacring two dozen Polish professors (as well as members of their households and guests, increasing the total number of victims to more than forty), who included members of other academic institutions, too. The extent to which Ukrainian nationalists may have been involved in identifying and selecting some of the victims is still a matter of debate, as Polish historian Adam Redzik wrote, while the Ukrainian nationalist students helped prepare lists of Polish intellectuals, it is unlikely they expected or knew about their intended purposes (i.e., the executions).\n\nIn the summer of 1944, the advancing Red Army, assisted by Polish Home Army forces locally implementing Operation Burza, pushed the Wehrmacht out of Lviv and the university reopened. At first, its academic staff consisted of Poles, but within the following months most of them, together with the Polish population of the city, were \"evacuated\", i.e. expelled, as Stalin had moved Poland's borders far to the west. The traditions of Jan Kazimierz University have been preserved at the University of Wrocław, which was established replacing the University of Breslau after the German inhabitants of Breslau/Wrocław had been expelled following Stalin's establishing Germany's eastern border farther to the west.The proclamation of the independence of Ukraine in 1991 brought about radical changes in every sphere of university life. Professor, Doctor Ivan Vakarchuk, a renowned scholar in the field of Theoretical Physics, had been rector of the university since 1990 till 2013. Meeting the requirements arising in recent years new faculties and departments have been set up: the Faculty of International Relations and the Faculty of Philosophy (1992), the Faculty of Pre-Entrance University Preparation (1997), the Chair of Translation Studies and Comparative Linguistics (1998). Since 1997 the following new units have come into existence within the teaching and research framework of the university: the Law College, The Humanities Centre, The Institute of Literature Studies, The Italian Language and Culture Resource Centre. The teaching staff of the university has increased amounting to 981, with scholarly degrees awarded to over two thirds of the entire teaching staff. There are over one hundred laboratories and working units as well as the Computing Centre functioning here. The Zoological, Geological, Mineralogical Museums together with those of Numismatics, Sphragistics and Archeology are stimulating the interests of students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Dinajpur is the largest district among all sixteen northern districts of Bangladesh.\n\nDinajpur was once a part of the ancient state of Pundravardhana. Devkot which rotated as the capital of Lakhnauti was located south of Dinajpur town. It is also called \"City of Maharajas\".\n\nAn ancient engraved stone, believed to be from the Gupta era, was recovered from the bank of a pond near Sura Masjid in the Ghoraghat Upazila in Dinajpur in 8 October.\n\nThe British administrative control in Dinajpur was established in 1786. Dinajpur was the biggest administrative district of undivided Bengal.\nIn 1765 the British got the Dewani of Bengal and in 1772 an English District Collector and Chief of Revenue was appointed in Dinajpur. The area was then notorious for lawlessness. Mr Marriott was Collector in 1786. Next to him Mr Red Fern and Mr Vansittart were Collectors for short periods. The next Collector Mr Hatch started to exercise judicial powers too. The District Magistrate's area at that time extended to Malda, Bagura and Dinajpur.\nIn the last decade of the 18th century indigo plantation started in the district.\n\nThe district Dinajpur in British times included a greater portion of Bagura. Malda and parts of Rajshahi, Rangpur and Purnea. At the time of Revenue Survey in 1857–1861 the total area of the district was . Between 1795 and 1800, large tracts of land were transferred to Purnea, Rangpur and Rajshahi for administrative convenience and better enforcement of law and order. In 1833 again some estates were transferred to Bagura and Malda. In 1864–65, 1868 and 1870 further transfer of territory from Dinajpur to Malda and Bagura took place. Finally in 1897–98 the whole of Thana Mahadevpur was made over to Rajshahi. At that time, except Thakurgaon Sub division, the rest of Dinajpur district remained under the direct supervision of the collector.\n\nAt first, after its formation in 1856, the Dinajpur Municipality used to be run by a town committee presided over by the Deputy Magistrate. This was among the first 40 municipalities in Bengal at that time. Later in 1868, the 'District Town Act' commissioned a chairman of the municipality who replaced the Deputy Magistrate and given a similar rank as a district magistrate. Mr. Patterson was appointed the first chairman of Dinajpur Municipality in 1869.\n\nAt the time of Partition of India in 1947, part of greater Dinajpur district was included in West Bengal and it was named West Dinajpur district.

{"id": "2271263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271263", "title": "2005 Pacific typhoon season", "text": "2005 Pacific typhoon season\n\nThe 2005 Pacific typhoon season was the least active typhoon season since 2000, featuring only 23 tropical storms, 13 typhoons and three super typhoons. The season ran throughout 2005, though most tropical cyclones typically develop between May and October. The season's first named storm, Kulap, developed on January 15, while the season's last named storm, Bolaven, dissipated on November 20.\n\nAlthough the season was quiet, some typhoons caused extensive damages in many places, especially in China where eight typhoons struck the country. First, Typhoon Haitang became the strongest storm in the basin this year and caused about $1 billion in damages in Taiwan and China in mid July. In August, Typhoon Matsa made landfall in Eastern China and caused about $2.2 billion in damages. Later that same month, two powerful typhoons made landfall, causing extreme damage and some casualties. Similar to Haitang, Typhoon Longwang made landfall in Taiwan and China at a strong intensity causing damages. The season also marked the first time the Atlantic hurricane season was more active than the Pacific typhoon season (the other being 2010). However, the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season featured record high activity while the Pacific typhoon season featured near average activity.\n\nThe scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean north of the equator between 100°E and 180th meridian. Within the northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones which can often result in a cyclone having two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency  will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65 km/h (40 mph) anywhere in the basin, whilst the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration  assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N–25°N regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the JMA. Tropical depressions that are monitored by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center  are given a number with a \"W\" suffix.\n\nDuring the year several national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many tropical cyclones, tropical storms, and typhoons will form during a season and/or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country. These agencies included the Tropical Storm Risk  Consortium of University College London, PAGASA and Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau. Some of the forecasts took into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the La Niña conditions that were observed during the previous year.\n\nOn March 14, TSR published their extended range forecast for the 2005 season, in which the anticipated that they would see tropical activity slightly below the average. They predicted that there would be a total of 25-26 tropical storms and 16 typhoons. The TSR, however, forecast that their number of intense typhoons would go slightly above the average, bringing their prediction of 10 intense typhoons. Their main reasons behind this is due to weaker trade force winds occurring in many parts of the basin, and there would be an enhanced cyclonic vorticity over the northwestern part of the Pacific. On April 27, the GCACIC made their first forecast for the season, expecting about 24 tropical storms developing, in which 15 of them would strengthen into typhoons. By May 5, TSR published their first forecast, still predicting a near average typhoon season. Around this time, 27-28 tropical storms, 17-18 typhoons and 9 intense typhoons were predicted, with the slight increase of the number of tropical storms were due to a slight increase in temperatures within the Niño 3.75 region.\n\nTSR's second forecast was released on June 7, now predicting a slightly above average season, with the only change for their predicted cyclone numbers was a slight increase of intense typhoons to 9.4. The GCACIC made their second and final forecast for the season on June 24, slightly increasing their numbers to 25 tropical storms and 16 typhoons. The TSR maintained their predictions after their third forecast update on July 5. Sea-surface temperatures within the Pacific were predicted to be more warmer than that predicted back in the May forecast. On August 5, TSR released their fourth and final forecast for the season, still remaining the same numbers along with the same reasonings.\n\nAlso, windspeed advisories differ from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center to the Japan Meteorological Agency as the JTWC uses the U.S. criteria of 1 minute mean to designate maximum sustained winds, while the JMA uses the 10-minute mean wind criteria to designate tropical cyclone maximum sustained winds. This difference generally means that JTWC maximum winds will appear to be higher than the maximum winds described by the JMA for the same cyclone.\n\nOn January 12, a tropical disturbance developed within an area of light vertical wind shear. This allowed deep convection to develop over a broad low-level circulation. The next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) as the system continued to develop. Later that day, they issued their first advisory on Tropical Depression 01W while the storm was located about 215 km (130 mi) southwest of Chuuk. Several hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) also designated the system as a tropical depression. Early on January 15, the JTWC upgraded 01W to a tropical storm as the system turned towards the north. The northward movement was the result of the system traveling along the edge of a low to mid-level ridge located to the east. About 12 hours later, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name \"Kulap\"; which was contributed by Thailand and is the Thai word for rose. Kulap gradually intensified over the next two days, reaching its peak intensity with winds of 95 km/h (60 mph ) around 1800 UTC on January 17, making it a severe tropical storm according to the JMA. However, at the same time the JMA assessed Kulap to have reached its peak intensity, the JTWC classified it as a minimal typhoon with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph ). Shortly after reaching its peak intensity, the storm began to undergo an extratropical transition and weaken. Late on January 18, the JTWC issued their final advisory on Kulap despite the storm remaining tropical. The JMA considered Kulap to have been a tropical storm until early the next day. The storm dissipated as a weak extratropical system around 1200 UTC on January 19. Between January 13 and 14, the storm produced heavy rains over the island of Chuuk. Upwards of 300 mm (12 in) of rain fell during the two-day span, of which 166.6 mm (6.5 in) fell in 24 hours.\n\nA tropical disturbance formed on March 11, near the equator. It rapidly developed into Tropical Depression 02W on March 13 as it steadily moved north, then west towards the Philippines. Later that day, it entered warm waters as it was upgraded into Tropical Storm Roke. Due to a strong ridge of high pressure north of it, it moved west-southwest, attaining peak intensity as a severe tropical storm. Roke then entered the PAR, giving the name Auring later that day. It made landfall in eastern Visayas on March 16. The next day, Roke rapidly weakened due to cool waters and dissipated on March 18.\nRoke is a male Chamorro name. Seven people were killed and damages amounted to $166,000 (2005 USD).\n\nA large area of convection formed on April 11. Late on April 14, a newly disorganized disturbance formed in that area and steadily intensified. The next two days, the disturbance interacted with another low-pressure area as it moved north towards warm waters. On April 17, the depression weakened due to strong vertical windshear. The JTWC designated as Tropical Depression 03W on April 18. Although the JMA started classifying it as a tropical depression on April 21. It rapidly intensified into a tropical storm, with the JMA naming it Sonca late on April 20. Very early on April 21, the PAGASA classified it as a storm, naming it Bising. Convection built up the storm again on April 22 and entered an area with favorable conditions. The next day, Sonca rapidly intensified into a Category 4 typhoon until it reached peak intensity on mid-April 24. Sonca rapidly weakened due to cool waters and dissipated on April 27.\n\nOn May 8, a parade of tropical disturbances formed and affected southern Philippines from an ITCZ. As the ITCZ weakened on May 13, the last disturbance formed southeast of Mindanao, Philippines. It moved north until it became a tropical depression on May 16 at 0000 UTC (0800 PHT) 180 nautical miles (330 km) east of Surigao on Mindanao Island. It was assigned the name Crising by PAGASA. The storm never organized into a tropical storm and did not receive the more recognized International name for West Pacific storms. The storm drifted northwest then southwest and began losing convection. PAGASA stopped tracking the storm 24 hours later on the 17th at 0000 UTC (0800 PHT) 145 nautical miles (270 km) east of Surigao.\n\nA tropical depression formed from a tropical wave late on May 28. It rapidly intensified into Tropical Storm Nesat on May 30, rapidly moving west. This was a powerful storm that formed on May 30 about 290 nautical miles (540 km) south-southeast of Guam as Tropical Depression 04W. It was quickly upgraded to Tropical Storm Nesat overnight at 1800 UTC (0200 PHT May 31). \"Nesat\" is a Cambodian word for fisherman. On the evening of June 1, it strengthened into Typhoon Nesat. On June 2, it entered the Philippine area of responsibility and was assigned the name Dante for Philippine warnings. Typhoon Nesat (Dante) quickly grew to a Category 4 storm as it approached the Philippines, but it curved away to the northeast and did not pose a threat to land. Waxing and waning in strength it eventually became extratropical southeast of Honshū, Japan at tropical storm strength on the morning of June 10 at 0000 UTC (0900 JST).\n\nA large tropical disturbance formed on July 2. The PAGASA issued a tropical depression strength near the Philippines on July 4 at 0600 UTC (1400 PHT) about 35 nautical miles (65 km) northeast of Catarman on Samar Island, giving the name Emong. It was assigned the name Emong by PAGASA. The storm never organized into a tropical storm and did not receive the more recognized International name for West Pacific storms. As a poorly organized depression it drifted over Luzon on July 5. Upper-level shear and the depression's landfall caused the storm to lose organization on July 6 while located about 40 nautical miles (75 km) south of Hong Kong.\n\nAn upper-level low associated with an easterly wave occurred late on July 7. It became a tropical depression on the evening of July 11 as a poorly organized depression about 110 nautical miles (280 km) west of Marcus Island, Japan at 1200 UTC (2000 JST). By 1800 UTC (0300 JST July 13), it had reached tropical storm strength and was named Haitang, a Chinese name for flowering crabapple. It grew to typhoon strength at 1800 UTC (0300 JST July 14) the following day. As it moved westward it continued to gain in strength, reaching Category three status as it entered the Philippine area of responsibility. PAGASA named the storm Feria for Philippine warnings on July 15. By July 16, the storm continued tracking west and became a threat to Taiwan and Japan's Sakishima Islands. Haitang strengthened into a Category 5 super typhoon. On July 17 it weakened to a Category 3 as it continued west, sparing Sakishima a direct hit but aiming directly for Taiwan. Typhoon Haitang made landfall near Hualien, Taiwan at 0000 UTC (0800 HKT) on the morning of July 18. Taking a full day to cross the island and over the interior mountains, it caused flash floods and landslides killing four people. Weakening to a tropical storm as it entered the South China Sea, it reorganized into a minimal typhoon as it approached the southeast China coast. Haitang made landfall for the second time near Wenzhou China on July 19 at 1200 UTC (2000 HKT). Moving inland, it rapidly lost its strength and dissipated. PAGASA stopped issuing advisories for the storm near Jiangxi on July 20.\n\nAn upper-level low formed on July 17 near warm waters. It steadily intensified, moving north on July 20, with both JMA and JTWC upgrading it as Tropical Storm Nalgae. Later that day, it passed by an area of convection and cluster of thunderstorms, reaching peak intensity on July 21. It maintained its intensity until the afternoon hours of July 22, but the JMA classified it as a severe tropical storm. Nalgae rapidly weakened as it was downgraded into a depression on July 23 by both agencies. The JTWC made its final warnings on the morning of July 24 as it became extratropical. The remnants of Nalgae was absorbed by a large extratropical system from Tropical Storm Banyan on July 28. In post-analysis, the JMA downgraded it to a Tropical Storm.\n\nTropical Storm Nalgae formed from a tropical disturbance 325 nautical miles (600 km) northwest of Wake Island on the morning of July 20. \"Nalgae\" is a Korean word for wing. Nalgae did not reach typhoon intensity or threaten land. It turned to the north and then east, avoiding Japan.\n\nA large tropical disturbance formed late on July 19, which formed in area of high convection and from the outflow of Typhoon Haitang. It rapidly intensified into a strong depression on July 21. While tracking northwards, it was named and upgraded as Tropical Storm Banyan later on July 22. Late on July 23, Banyan reached peak intensity of a severe tropical storm by the JMA until the sunset hours of July 24. Banyan rapidly weakened as it affected Japan by bringing heavy rainfall from July 25 to 28. It made landfall on July 26 and became a large extratropical system on July 27, which made the JTWC issued Banyan's final warning very early on that day. The system absorbed the extratropical remnants of Nalgae the next day and fully dissipated on July 31, affecting Alaska and Canada.\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Banyan formed from a tropical disturbance about 300 nautical miles (550 km) north of Yap Island on the evening of July 21 at 1200 UTC (2100 JST). \"Banyan\" is a tree common in India and southern China. Banyan brushed the southern and eastern coasts of Honshū, Japan on July 26. It became extratropical off the northeastern coast of Honshū on July 27.\n\nA cluster of thunderstorms was pulled from the very strong outflow from Tropical Storm Banyan east of Manila, Philippines on July 26. The next day, it was classified into a tropical disturbance which was moving northwest towards Hong Kong. On July 28, it became a tropical depression and then a tropical storm the next day, with the JMA naming it as Washi. Later that day, it reached peak intensity and rapidly weakened due to an exposed circulation on July 31. Washi finally dissipated later that day, with its remnants energy moving west dissipating on August 2.\n\nTropical Storm Washi formed as a tropical depression about 215 nautical miles (400 km) south of Hong Kong. \"Washi\" is a Japanese word for the constellation Aquila. The storm moved west towards Hainan. Tropical Storm Washi made its first landfall near Xinglong, Hainan. After re-entering the Gulf of Tonkin, the storm made its final landfall near Nam Dinh, Vietnam.\n\nTyphoon Matsa (Gorio) formed as a depression 130 nautical miles (240 km) west northwest of Yap Island. \"Matsa\" is a Laotian name for a lady fish. Matsa formed east of and then moved into the Philippine area of responsibility. It has been assigned the name Gorio for Philippine advisories. Matsa passed between Taiwan and Okinawa with the center of the storm passing over the Yaeyama Islands of Japan on the evening of August 4. The storm made landfall near Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shanghai on mainland China on the morning of August 6 with maximum sustained winds of 145 km/h (90 mph). The storm rapidly dissipated inland over China but remnants brought heavy rain inland west of Shanghai.\n\nTyphoon Sanvu (Huaning) formed as a tropical depression on the morning of August 10 at 0000 UTC (0800 PHT) 320 nautical miles east-northeast of Borongan on Samar Island inside the Philippine area of responsibility. PAGASA assigns names to Tropical Depressions because they often bring heavy rains and mudslides to the Philippines. Storm was named Tropical Depression Huaning for Philippine warnings but within 24 hours received the more recognized name Sanvu when it became a Tropical Storm. Sanvu is a Chinese name for coral. Tropical Storm Sanvu (Huaning) passed over a peninsula in Cagayan province on the island of Luzon early on the morning of August 12. It was upgraded to a typhoon before making landfall in China the next day on August 13. Sanvu (Huaning) rapidly dissipated after moving inland on August 14.\n\nSanvu was the first typhoon that necessitated a tropical cyclone signal for Hong Kong.\n\nAnother tropical disturbance formed east of Tropical Depression 11W on August 18. In the same time where 11W became Mawar, the disturbance rapidly intensified into Tropical Depression 12W on the morning of August 20 at 0000 UTC (0900 JST) 190 nautical miles (350 kilometers) southwest of Marcus Island, Japan. It reached Tropical Storm strength the next day and was named Guchol, a Yapese name for the spice turmeric. It reached peak intensity late on August 23. Guchol curved to the northwest and never threatened land. It became extratropical August 25 at 0000 UTC (0900 JST) 735 nautical miles (1,285 km) east-southeast of Nakashibetsu, Hokkaidō, Japan. The remnants of the storm dissipated and crossed the International Dateline on August 27.\n\nA cluster of thunderstorms began to circulate into a tropical disturbance early on August 18. Its circulation became exposed and intensified again later that day. It became Tropical Depression 11W on the evening of August 19 at 1200 UTC (2100 JST) 245 nautical miles (455 kilometers) southeast of Iwo Jima. The storm intensified rapidly in two days to a Category 4 Super Typhoon but weakened as it approached Japan. Mawar made landfall on Honshū as a Category 2 Typhoon on August 25 at 1800 UTC (August 26 0300 JST) with winds of 95 mph (152 km/h). After moving inland to the northwest it was downgraded to a Category 1 typhoon before entering the Pacific Ocean. It was downgraded to a Tropical Storm on August 26 and became extratropical on August 27. The extratropical remnants of Mawar dissipated on August 30. Two people have been killed by Mawar.\nTropical Depression 13W formed on the afternoon of August 26 at 0600 UTC northeast of the island of Yap. Within 24 hours it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Talim and the next day became a Typhoon. Talim is a Philippine name for a knife or sharp cutting edge. Typhoon Talim was assigned the name Typhoon Isang for Philippine warnings when it entered the Philippine area of responsibility on August 29. Typhoon Talim (Isang) made landfall at 1800 UTC August 31 (0200 PHT September 1) as a Category 3 storm. Talim dissipated over southeastern China on September 1. Typhoon Talim left at least 110 people dead and 23 missing in Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi & Anhui provinces, with at least 40 people dead in the latter province due to landslides. It also left 7 dead in Taiwan. \nTyphoon Nabi formed from a tropical depression on the afternoon of August 29 at 0600 UTC (1600 AEST) east of Saipan. 18 hours later it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Nabi. Nabi is a Korean word for a butterfly. It strengthened into a Typhoon on August 30 and passed near the islands of Saipan and Guam on August 31.After passing near the Marianas Islands, the storm continued to strengthen until reaching Category 5 intensity on September 1. Typhoon Nabi was assigned the name Jolina for Philippine warnings when it entered the Philippine area of responsibility on September 3. Typhoon Nabi (Jolina) passed to the east of the island of Okinawa, Japan, and made landfall in the Kagoshima Prefecture of Japan on September 6 as a Category 2 storm. It dissipated shortly after that.\n\nTwenty-one deaths have been reported in Japan. On September 8, five people were missing in South Korea and fifty in Japan as a result of the storm. Japan also reported 143 injured. The storm damaged 10,000 homes in Japan, where 31 of 47 prefectures reported some damage. Eighty-eight roads in Japan were damaged, and 168 landslides were reported there. The heaviest damage was in Miyazaki prefecture on the island of Kyūshū. There were no deaths in the Marianas Islands. Saipan did experience heavy wind gusts of 120 km/h (75 mph). Guam experienced gale-force wind gusts in addition to approximately 75 mm (3 in) of rain.\n\nTropical Depression 15W formed from a well-defined low pressure system located about 50 nautical miles (95 km) east of Yap on September 6. It strengthened into a tropical storm later that day. The system was classified as a tropical storm by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center on September 6, while the Japan Meteorological Agency, the agency responsible for naming typhoons, did not upgrade the system until a day later. Tropical Storm 15W entered the Philippine area of responsibility on September 7. It was named Kiko by PAGASA first before being named Khanun by the JMA. Khanun is the Thai name for jackfruit. Typhoon Khanun (Kiko) made landfall in eastern China on September 11 at 0600 UTC (1400 HKT). Khanun dissipated the next day, September 12.\n\nMore than 800,000 people were evacuated from their homes as the storm neared. Many people, evacuated by the army, were taken to schools, railway stations, hotels and other solid buildings to take shelter from the approaching storm.\n\nThe city of Taizhou, Zhejiang bore the initial brunt of the storm as it was close to where the storm made landfall, 220 km south of Shanghai. Other coastal cities braced for the typhoon as it headed north. At least 14 people were killed and 1 went missing in Zhejiang province. Damages totaled to $849 million (2005 USD).\n\nJapan's southern Sakishima Islands suffered strong winds, high waves and heavy rains as the storm passed. Opening hours at some polling stations were altered to make sure citizens could still vote in the Japanese general election despite the weather.\nTropical Depression 16W formed 205 nautical miles (375 km) east-southeast of Dong Tac Airport, Vietnam on the morning of September 16. It reached Tropical Storm strength overnight local time and was named Vicente, a Chamorro male name. Shortly after forming, Vicente interacted with a tropical disturbance west of Luzon and made a cyclonic loop. Vicente then absorbed the disturbance before passing just south of Hainan Island. Eventually, Vicente tracked into the Vietnam coast northwest of Huế on September 18 and gradually dissipated.\n\nAs the pressure gradient between Vicente and a ridge of high pressure over southeastern China brought a strong easterly airstream to the coastal areas of Guangdong and caused rough seas with swells, a swimmer was drowned on September 17. Another one drowned the following day in rough seas at Sai Kung, Hong Kong.\nAlso, a ship from China struck a reef between Shangchuan and Xiachuan Islands. All seventeen crew members were rescued.\n\nIn Vietnam, about 5 people were killed or reported missing.\n\nA tropical disturbance formed from the monsoon and moved northwest on September 15. The next day, it became more organized and the Japan Meteorological Agency initiated a warning for Tropical Depression 18W southwest of Marcus Island, Japan at 0000 UTC (0900 JST), September 20. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Saola 18 hours later as it continued to strengthen moving westward. Due to a normal speed of a typhoon and warm waters, Saola became a typhoon and reached peak intensity early on September 22. The strorm didn't made landfall but it affect Japan from September 23 to 25 by bringing heavy rainfall. Saola weakened to a tropical storm and became extratropical on September 26.\n\nDue to its proximity to the Philippines, PAGASA assigned it the name Labuyo and began issuing advisories on a disturbed area of tropical weather to the east of the islands on September 19. The JMA started to warn on the system on the same day. On September 20 it was classified as Tropical Depression 17W by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. On September 21, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Damrey. It strengthened into a typhoon on September 24. Damrey is a Cambodian word for elephant.\n\nTyphoon Damrey (Labuyo) made landfall at Wanning, in China's Hainan province at 2000 UTC, September 25 (0400 September 26 local time) with maximum sustained winds up to 180 km/h. This made Damrey the strongest typhoon to strike Hainan since Typhoon Marge in September 1973.\n\nAt least 16 people are believed to have died in China, and the entire province of Hainan suffered power outages. Damrey then went on to impact Vietnam before losing tropical characteristics while a Tropical Storm. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center ceased advisories with the final one at 0900 UTC September 27 with the system south-southwest of Hanoi, Vietnam.\nTropical Depression 19W formed about south-southeast of Iwo Jima, Japan on September 26. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated a warning for it at 0000 UTC the same day, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Longwang six hours later. Longwang is Chinese for Dragon King. At 0300 UTC September 27, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded it to a typhoon. It continued to increase in strength as it tracked west to west-northwest towards Taiwan, and was upgraded to a super typhoon on September 29. PAGASA named the storm Maring for Philippine warnings on September 29. Longwang made landfall at 0515 local time on October 2 south of Hualien City, Taiwan as a Category 4 storm. Half a day later, at 2135 local time (1335 UTC), it made second landfall in Fujian Province, China as a minimal typhoon. Longwang dissipated on the next day.\n\nDespite its intensity, Longwang caused mostly property damage, and claimed only one life in Taiwan.\n\nThe meteorological agencies is now operated of Guangdong and Hainan upgraded a low-pressure center over South China Sea to a tropical depression at 0800 local time, October 6. The Hong Kong Observatory followed suit 30 hours later. The JTWC finally issued a warning for this system at 1500 UTC October 7 (2300 local time), and tropical depression number 20W was issued to the system. The JTWC issued its final advisory on the system just six hours later, west-northwest of Huế, Vietnam. As the system never reached Tropical Storm strength, it was not given a name from the list. The only damage it did, if any, however, was that massive rainfall amounts were recorded - over 230 mm (9 inches) were recorded in some parts of Hainan.\n\nA large cluster of thunderstorms formed with convection developed and separated into three low-pressure areas on October 6. But dew to warm waters in the western side, two failed to become storms and the Japan Meteorological Agency began issuing warnings for the other disturbance and became Tropical Depression 21W, which was located southeast of Okinawa at 1200 UTC, October 9 and assigned the name Kirogi to it at 0600 UTC next day. Prior to becoming a Tropical Storm it entered the Philippine area of responsibility and was assigned the name Nando by PAGASA for Philippine warnings. JTWC finally issued a warning for Kirogi at 0900 UTC, October 10, despite listing it as a Tropical Depression. It was upgraded to a typhoon at 0000 UTC October 12, and reached Category 4 strength about nine hours later. On October 16, Kirogi weakened was it pushes northeast. Kirogi was declared extratropical at 0300 UTC October 19.\nKirogi is a Korean word for a type of migrating bird that lives in North Korea from autumn to spring.\n\nA tropical disturbance developed north of Papua New Guinea on October 20. It entered in an area of favorable environments on October 23, as it slowly intensified. On October 25, it affected the Philippines and rapidly moved to the South China Sea on October 27. The next day, the Japan Meteorological Agency initiated marine warnings for a Tropical Depression. Fifteen hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued the number 22W to the system. The next day it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Kai-tak. Kai-tak was a name submitted by Hong Kong in honor of their former airport. On October 30 it was upgraded to a Typhoon. Kai-tak made landfall north of Huế, Vietnam, early on the morning of November 2. At least 19 people were killed and 10 others were left missing in Vietnam. Damages from the storm were estimated to be at least $11 million (2005 USD).\n\nThe Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated warning for Tropical Depression 23W at 0900 UTC November 7, north-northwest of the Micronesian island of Yap. The storm gained enough power to warrant upgrading to a Tropical Storm 12 hours later. The system entered the Philippine area of responsibility on the morning of November 8 and was named Ondoy by PAGASA. The storm encountered shear as it moved west, and lost organisation on November 8, being downgraded to a tropical depression. On November 9 it regained tropical storm strength and had a better LLCC (low-level circulation centre). On November 10 it was named Tembin by the JMA.\nTembin is a Japanese constellation for the group of stars known in the west as Libra. Tembin then made landfall near midnight November 11 local time in the northern Philippines and lost much of its circulation and convection. Tembin dissipated rapidly the next day.\n\nA low-pressure area formed along from the outflow of Tropical Storm Tembin on November 10. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated a TCFA warning for a low-pressure system about 150 nautical miles (280 km) west-southwest of Palau late on November 12. This was upgraded to a tropical depression the next afternoon, 290 nautical miles (550 km) west of Palau. Forming inside the Philippine area of responsibility it has been named Pepeng by PAGASA. It was named Bolaven on November 16 by the JMA. Bolaven is a Laotian word meaning plateau or mesa. Although it strengthened into a Category 1 typhoon on November 17, it weakened to a tropical storm before making landfall on November 20 at about 800 local time in Cagayan Valley in the northern Philippines. Bolaven rapidly dissipated that same day north of the Philippines on November 21.\n\nOn December 16, a tropical disturbance developed and was given the name Quedan by PAGASA. Quedan organized into Tropical Depression 25W on December 18 off the northern coast of Borneo. On December 19, the JTWC classified it as a Tropical Storm. The JMA upgraded it to a tropical depression, but they warned it for a brief time. The storm dissipated early on December 20, as wind shear increased on the system.\n\nWithin the North-western Pacific Ocean, both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assign names to tropical cyclones that develop in the Western Pacific, which can result in a tropical cyclone having two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency's RSMC Tokyo — Typhoon Center assigns international names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the World Meteorological Organization's Typhoon Committee, should they be judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 65 km/h, (40 mph). While the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N-25°N even if the cyclone has had an international name assigned to it. The names of significant tropical cyclones are retired, by both PAGASA and the Typhoon Committee. Should the list of names for the Philippine region be exhausted then names will be taken from an auxiliary list of which the first ten are published each season. Unused names are marked in .\n\nDuring the season 23 named tropical cyclones developed in the Western Pacific and were named by the Japan Meteorological Agency, when it was determined that they had become tropical storms. These names were contributed to a list of a 140 names submitted by the fourteen members nations and territories of the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee. After the season the Typhoon Committee retired the names Matsa, Nabi and Longwang from its naming lists, and in February 2006, the names were subsequently replaced with Pakhar, Doksuri and Haikui for future seasons.\n\nDuring the season PAGASA used its own naming scheme for the 22 tropical cyclones, that either developed within or moved into their self-defined area of responsibility. The names not retired used again during 2009. This same list used during 2001, except \"Bising\", \"Dante\", \"Nando\", \"Pepeng\", \"Ramil\", \"Santi\", \"Tino\", \"Undang\", \"Yolanda\" and \"Zoraida\", which replaced \"Barok\", \"Darna\", \"Nanang\", \"Pabling\", \"Roleta\", \"Sibak\", \"Talahib\", \"Ubbeng\", \"Yaning\" and \"Zuma\". The names \"Bising\", \"Dante\", \"Nando\" and \"Pepeng\" used the first time. No names have been retired, although the PAGASA had changed the name Undang to Urduja, as it was retired in 1984.\n\nThis table summarizes all the systems that developed within or moved into the North Pacific Ocean, to the west of the International Date Line during 2005. The tables also provide an overview of a systems intensity, duration, land areas affected and any deaths or damages associated with the system.\n\n\n"}

The first fort with that name was built in 1794 by Captain Jean François Hamtramck under orders from General \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne as part of the campaign against the Miami Indians during the Northwest Indian War. It was named after General Wayne, who was victorious at the just prior Battle of Fallen Timbers. Wayne may have chosen the name himself—the fort was dedicated the day after he left it. The fort was officially occupied by the army on October 21, 1794. The fort was a basic stockade with few buildings, and was located near the present intersection of Berry and Clay streets.\n\nThe fort was constructed to secure gains in the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794 and saw service in the war of 1812. After the war, settlements started growing up around the fort. \n\nThe fort was abandoned in 1819 with cessation of Indian hostilities and the modern city of Fort Wayne was platted in 1823. A replica of the fort as it existed in 1815 (called The Old Fort) was created in a different location in the city, and is a tourist attraction today. \nFort Wayne was the successor to several previous French (later British) military outposts at the location, the Indian village of Kekionga, which was the capital of the Miami tribe prior to the Northwest Indian wars. French Canadian soldier Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes built the first fortified trading post on the site in 1704 called Fort Miami.\n\nWayne's Legion arrived at Kekionga on 17 September 1794, and Wayne personally selected the site for the new U.S. fort. Wayne wanted a strong fort built, capable of withstanding not only an Indian uprising, but a possible attack by the British from Fort Detroit. The fort was finished by 17 October, and was capable of withstanding 24-pound cannons. It was named Fort Wayne and placed under command of Major Jean François Hamtramck, who had been commandant of Fort Knox in Vincennes. The fort was officially dedicated 22 October (the fourth anniversary of Harmar's Defeat), and the day is considered the founding of the modern city of Fort Wayne.\n\nThe garrison at Fort Wayne normally consisted of about 100 men and their families. In 1796, the garrison was ordered to march down the Maumee River to counteract a British demonstration. The force received the transfer of Fort Miami from the British before Colonel Hamtramck was transferred to Fort Detroit - later the site of another Fort Wayne, and near the future town of Hamtramck, Michigan. Colonel David Strong, a veteran of the American Revolution and Wayne's Legion, succeeded him as commandant of Fort Wayne for two years, before transferring commands with Colonel Hamtramck in 1798.\n\nColonel Thomas Hunt—a veteran of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, Bunker Hill, and Wayne's Legion—took command of the fort on 16 May 1798, and built a substantial new fort several hundred yards north of the original, near the modern city's Old Fort Park. The new fort contained multiple guard houses and Indian \"factories\" (trading posts). The first fort was demolished about 1800.\n\nDuring the War of 1812, Fort Dearborn (in present Chicago) was evacuated and the residents tried to reach Fort Wayne, but were massacred before they arrived. Fort Wayne was next besieged by the Indian forces of Tecumseh during the Siege of Fort Wayne. Captain James Rhea was in charge of the fort and considered surrendering the fort, but his two lieutenants relieved him of duty. General William Henry Harrison arrived on September 12, 1812 and broke the siege. Captain Rhea was formally relieved of duty and one of the lieutenants, named Ostrander, was given official command of the fort. After the war, a town began growing around the fort. \n\nA third fort was built in 1815/16 by Major John Whistler. The fort was officially abandoned on April 19, 1819, and its contents shipped to Fort Detroit. The last of the old fort was demolished in 1852 to make way in the town.\n\n"}

{"id": "2271273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271273", "title": "Gaibandha District", "text": "Gaibandha District\n\nGaibandha (, \"Gaibandha Jela\" also \"Gaibandha Zila\") is a district in Northern Bangladesh. It is a part of the Rangpur Division. Gaibandha subdivision was established in 1875. Gaibandha was previously known as Bhabanigonj. The name was changed from Bhabanigonj to Gaibandha in 1875. Gaibandha was established as a district in 15 February 1984. Gaibandha is the administrative headquarter and largest urban centre of this district.\n\nThere are two opinions about the name of Gaibandha. The most famous opinion is: around five thousand years ago, capital of Matsya Kingdom of King Birat was in Gobindaganj area. \"Matsa\" means fish and \"desh\" means country. Fishes were abundant in his kingdom so the term \"Matsa Desh\" was created. According to Mahabharata, king Birat had 60,000 cows which were frequently robbed by robbers. To protect his cattle from robbers, king Birat established a huge cattle-shed. The cattle were tied up alongside the rivers of this area. \"Gai\" means \"cow\" and \"Bandha\" means \"to tie up\". From this reason the area was called Gaibandha.\n\nIn ancient times, this area was under water which was filled by the silt of Teesta , Brahmaputra and Jamuna river over time. This statement can be found in the description of famous Chinese traveler Xuanzang and astronomical books of Ptolemy. The flood of 1787 and the earthquake of 1898 made a major change in the landscape of this area which changed the flow of Teesta river, filled up a vast 15 miles area between Ghoraghat Upazila of Dinajpur and Tulshighat of Gaibandha and created small rivers like Kartoa, Ghaghot and Katakhali.\n\nDuring the regime of British empire, Governor Warren Hastings established 24 thanas under Rangpur district collectorate in 1893. According to the 1873 report of E.G Glazier, collector of Rangpur, three of the thanas was established in today's Gaibandha. Two of them, Gobindogonj and Sadullapur were established in Idrakpur pargana and the other named as Bhabaniganj was established in the Patildaho pargana.\n\nDuring the Indian Rebellion of 1857, it was very difficult to stop the activities of the rebels from Rangpur. So Bhabaniganj thana was established in the bank of Bramhaputra river for administrative reason. In 27 May 1858, Bhabaniganj was established as a mahakuma. At first there were only two thanas: Sadullapur and Bhabaniganj. Gobindonganj was included in Bogra district 13 April 1821 but later in 12 August 1871, it was included in Bhabaniganj. Saghata, Phulchari, Palasbari and at last in 1870 Sundarganj was included in Bhabaniganj.\n\nIn 1872, river corrosion started in the eastside of Bramhaputra river. As a result, the mahakuma was moved from its original place and re-established in Gaibandha which was 12 km away from Bhabaniganj mahakuma. The sadar area was under control of three landlords. The patiladaho paragana was under control of Tagore family who was said to be related to the Rabindranath Tagore family, the Baharbondo pargana was under landlord Manindro Nandi, ruled by Krishnanath's wife Maharani Swarnamoyee of Kasim Bazar and the Muktipur pargana was under control of landlord Lahiri family of Thanshinghopur. There was a collision between the landlords regarding the establishment of the mahakuma. At last by the initiatives of government officials, the administrative building and the court were established in Baharbondo pargana which was donated by queen Swarnamoyee. When the Bhabaniganj mouza was beginning to destroy by river erosion, the name of this mahakuma was changed from Bhabanigonj to Gaibandha. In the 80's when the mahakumas were changed to districts, Gaibandha mahakuma was also established as a district.\n\nGaibandha has a total area of . It has boundaries with the Kurigram and Rangpur to the north, Bogra District to the south, Joypurhat District, Dinajpur and Rangpur districts to the west, and Jamalpur and Kurigram districts, and the Brahmaputra River to the east.

The fort is situated on the Detroit River at a point where it is under half a mile to the Ontario shore. The original 1848 limestone barracks (with later brick additions) still stands, as does the 1845 fort (renovated in 1863 with brick exterior facing). On the grounds but outside the original fort are additional barracks, officers quarters, hospital, shops, a recreation building, commissary, guard house, garage, and stables.\n\nThe fort sits on . Since the 1970s, , including the original fort and a number of buildings, has been operated by the city of Detroit. The remaining area is operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as a boatyard. The fort was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1958 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.\n\nFort Wayne is Detroit's third fort. The first, Fort Pontchartrain du Detroit, was built by the French in 1701 near current day Hart Plaza. This fort, constructed shortly after Cadillac landed, was manned by the French until they surrendered it to the British in 1760 during the French and Indian War. The British constructed the second fort, Fort Lernoult, a few years later, centered on current day Fort and Shelby streets. They manned the post until 1796 when the United States assumed control over the site and renamed it Fort Shelby. Following the end of the War of 1812, Fort Shelby fell into disrepair, and in 1826 the City of Detroit purchased and demolished it.\n\nThe site of Fort Wayne originally consisted of a high sand mound with freshwater springs along the marshy waterfront of the Detroit River; it is from this geography that Springwells Township (later annexed into the City of Detroit) took its name. The site has a history going back to about the year 1000 A.D. Approximately 19 Native American burial mounds were present in the immediate area, as well as a larger mound at the mouth of the Rouge River. The present bastioned fort was built atop one of these burial mounds. In the early 20th century, the sole remaining burial mound at Fort Wayne was excavated by archaeologists from the University of Michigan and was found to contain human remains dating over 900 years old. A type of pottery found there is unique to the site; it was subsequently dubbed \"Wayne Ware.\"\n\nWhen Cadillac founded Fort Detroit, he also purportedly made arrangements with the local Potawatomi people to set up a small village at the future site of Fort Wayne for purposes of trading; this was occupied and thriving by 1710.\n\nThe opening shots of the War of 1812 were fired in the vicinity of the fort's future site, the \"sand hill at Springwells\". Although war had not yet been officially declared, Michigan militiamen bombarded the town of Sandwich, Upper Canada (later annexed into Windsor), on July 4, 1812. Later in the course of the war, British general Isaac Brock crossed the narrowest part of the Detroit River with his troops and landed on the future Fort Wayne site before marching to Detroit. In the ensuing Siege of Detroit, American general William Hull, believing himself completely surrounded and outnumbered, surrendered Fort Shelby to the British without offering any resistance. The British later abandoned the fort and American troops reoccupied it. In 1815, the future Fort Wayne site was where American government and the local Native American tribal leaders met to sign the Treaty of Springwells, which marked the end of hostilities between the government and tribes who had allied with the British during the war. Among those present for the signing of the treaty were territorial governor Lewis Cass and General William Henry Harrison. \n\nIn the late 1830s, small, short-lived rebellions occurred in Canada to protest corruption within its colonial government. Many Americans believed there was widespread Canadian support for these rebellions and formed volunteer militias to overthrow Canada's colonial government. This led to a series of militia attacks on Canada known as the Patriot War. American troops were mustered to suppress the American volunteers and maintain America's official neutrality in the conflict. However, at the same time, the United States government realized there was a lack of fortifications along the northern border to repel a potential British attack, and in particular, no counterpart to the British Fort Malden located in Amherstburg. In 1841, Congress appropriated funds to build a chain of forts stretching from the east coast to the Minnesota Territory, including one at Detroit.\n\nSoon afterward, the Army sent Lieutenant Montgomery C. Meigs to Detroit. Meigs bought riverfront farm property three miles below Detroit, in Springwells Township, at the point on the Detroit River closest to Canada. Construction of the fort began in 1842, with Meigs overseeing. The original fortifications were cedar-revetted earthen walls. The fort was completed in 1851 at a cost of $150,000. The Army named the new fort for Revolutionary War hero General \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne, who had taken possession of Detroit from the British in 1796.\n\nThe original fort is a bastioned rectangle with walls of earthen ramparts faced with cedar, covering vaulted brick tunnels that contain artillery ports. The design was based on fortifications developed by Sebastian Vauban, a 17th-century French military engineer, and modified by Dennis Hart Mahan. Artillery emplacements are atop the walls, designed for cannons mounted to fire over the parapet, although there is no indication that artillery intended for the fort was ever installed. There is a dry moat surrounding the fort, and a demilune facing the river.\n\nAlthough the fort today is substantially similar to the original construction, some changes have been made. Starting in 1863, under the supervision of Thomas J. Cram, the walls of the fort were reconstructed, replacing the original cedar facing with brick and concrete. In addition, the entranceway to the fort has been altered. The original entrance to the fort was a small sally port in the southeast bastion. In 1938, an arched entrance was constructed through the fort's walls to accommodate vehicular traffic; later, the arches were removed to fit larger trucks.\n\nWithin the fort (and built at approximately the same time) is a Federal style, -story limestone troop barracks, consisting of five independent but adjacent sections. Each section contains a ground floor mess, two floors of barracks rooms, and an attic. Brick additions were added to the rear of the building in 1861, housing washrooms and kitchens. Next to the barracks is a powder magazine, also constructed of limestone. Additional buildings originally built within the fort, such as officer's housing, have long since been destroyed.\n\nNumerous additional buildings have been built on fort grounds outside of the fort. A row of wooden Victorian officer's homes was built in the 1880s. In 1937, these homes were completely refurbished and clad in brick by WPA workers. One home was restored in the 1980s to its original appearance. A Spanish–American War guardhouse, built in 1889, is in the center of the fort grounds. The guard house was restored in 1984. In 1890, a brick hospital was built, with a later addition in 1898. In 1905, a new guardhouse, still in use today, was built near the gate to the fort grounds. Around the same time, four barracks buildings for enlisted men were built, as well as a service club (1903), headquarters (1905), and post office. By 1928, duplex housing for senior NCOs. In 1939, more NCO houses were built in a row facing Jefferson Avenue.\n\nBefore any cannon had been installed at the newly constructed Fort Wayne, the United States and Britain peacefully resolved their differences, eliminating the need for a fort on the Detroit River. Fort Wayne remained unused for a decade after its initial construction, manned only by a single watchman. There is evidence suggesting that the fort was a final stop on the Underground Railroad during these dormant years, as the Irish farmer who lived next to the fort's demilune operated a small ferry to Canada to supplement his income, the only such ferry in this part of the city at that time.\nIn 1861, the American Civil War again made Fort Wayne relevant. British sympathy for the Confederacy renewed fears of an attack from Canada, leading to a reconstruction and strengthening of the fort walls. Two weeks after the beginning of the war, the Michigan 1st Volunteer Infantry Regiment was mustered into service at Fort Wayne. For the rest of the Civil War, the fort served as a mustering center for troops from Michigan, as well as a place for veterans to recover from their wounds. Alfred Gibbs was the first commander to occupy the fort, serving his parole at Fort Wayne after being captured by the Confederacy.\n\nAfter the Civil War and until 1920, Fort Wayne served as a garrison post, with regiments rotated from the western frontier for rest. In 1875, the city of Detroit annexed a portion of Springwells Township; in 1884, it annexed more of Springwells Township east of Livernois Avenue, including all land adjacent to Fort Wayne.\n\nDuring the Spanish–American War, troops from the fort headed to Cuba and the Philippines. The fort's guardhouse also housed the first telephone exchange in southwestern Detroit.\n\nDuring the Red Scare following World War I, the fort served as a temporary detention center for accused communists awaiting trial. In 1921, the world's first motorized ride-on lawn mower, patented by Ransom E. Olds and manufactured by the Ideal Power Mower Co. of Lansing, was used at Fort Wayne (as well as several other sites) for promotional purposes. During the Great Depression, the fort was opened to homeless families and it housed the Civilian Conservation Corps.\n\nDuring World War I, Fort Wayne had become instrumental in the acquisition of cars, trucks, and spare parts for the military. This motor vehicle supply function reached its peak in World War II, when Fort Wayne was designated Motor Supply Depot and additional buildings were constructed for warehousing and shipping. At that time, Fort Wayne was the largest motor supply depot in the entire world, the command center controlling the flow of materiel from the automobile factories to the citywide network of storage and staging facilities, which included the Michigan State Fairgrounds, and the Port of Detroit terminal. Every single tank, truck, jeep, tire, or spare part that was sent to the fronts of World War II from the Detroit factories came through Fort Wayne. At that time, there was a railroad spur along the riverfront, docks for large ships, and over 2,000 (mostly civilian women) workers were employed; the drivers and mechanics of the Red Ball Express were also trained here. Fort Wayne served as home to Italian prisoners of war (POWs) captured during the North African Campaign, who were employed as servants, cooks, and janitors. After Italy's surrender, the POWs were given the chance to return to Italy, but many chose to remain and settle in Detroit.\n\nAt the end of World War II, plans were made to close the fort. In 1948, the fort and original barracks were turned over to the City of Detroit's Historical Commission for operation as a military museum. In the 1950s, anti-aircraft guns were installed at the fort, later upgraded to Nike-Ajax missiles. During the Cold War, Fort Wayne served as an entrance station for the armed services, with thousands of enlistees and draftees being sworn in during the Korean War and Vietnam War. The fort was again used to provide housing to displaced families after the 1967 12th Street Riot, with the last families staying at the fort until 1971.\n\nThe remainder of Fort Wayne was turned over piecemeal to the city of Detroit, with the last bit of property delivered in 1976.\n\nFrom 1949 until 2006, the Fort Wayne Military Museum was operated by the Detroit Historical Museum. Since early 2006, the fort has been operated by the Detroit Recreation Department, assisted by the Historic Fort Wayne Coalition, the Friends of Fort Wayne, and the Detroit Historical Society.\n\nThe fort hosts historic reenactments (usually Civil War), spring and fall flea markets, concerts, youth soccer league matches, and Hispanic and Boy Scout events, and is open for some civic events. Areas can be rented for special events and family reunions. Also on the grounds is the remaining ancient Native American burial mound and the Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Museum.\n\nSpurred in part by construction of the new Gordie Howe International Bridge, nearby, the fort has been studied for possible inclusion in the national park system. The National Park Service has previously assisted in identifying ways to preserve the fort and draw visitors. Among the possibilities, the fort could become part of River Raisin National Battlefield Park, based in Monroe, to the southwest.\n\n"}

It was one of the world's most widely used mobile phone platforms and found in hundreds of millions of devices. Nokia announced on 25 January 2012 that the company has sold over 1.5 billion Series 40 devices. It was not used for smartphones, with Nokia turning first to Symbian, then in 2012–2017 to Windows Phone, and most recently Android. However, in 2012 and 2013, several Series 40 phones from the Asha line, such as the 308, 309 and 311, were advertised as \"smartphones\" although they do not actually support smartphone features like multitasking or a fully fledged HTML browser.\n\nIn 2014, Microsoft acquired Nokia's mobile phones business. As part of a licensing agreement with the company, Microsoft Mobile is allowed to use the Nokia brand on feature phones, such as the Series 40 range. However, a July 2014 company memo revealed that Microsoft would end future production of Series 40 devices. It was replaced by Series 30+.\n\nSeries 40's underlying operating system is called Intelligent System Architecture (ISA), also called the Nokia Operating System (NOS). Series 40 was introduced in 1999 with the release of the Nokia 7110. It had a 96 × 65 pixel monochrome display and was the first phone to come with a WAP browser. Over the years, the S40 UI evolved from a low-resolution UI to a high-resolution color UI with an enhanced graphical look. The third generation of Series 40 that became available in 2005 introduced support for devices with resolutions as high as QVGA (240×320). It is possible to customize the look and feel of the UI via comprehensive themes. In 2012, Nokia Asha mobile phones 200/201/210, 302/306/305/308/310/311, 303 and 311 were released and all used Series 40. The final feature phone running Series 40 was the Nokia 515 from 2013, running the 6th Edition.\n\nSeries 40 provides communication applications such as telephone, Internet telephony (VoIP), messaging, email client with POP3 and IMAP4 capabilities and web browser; media applications such as camera, video recorder, music/video player and FM radio; and phonebook and other personal information management (PIM) applications such as calendar and tasks. Basic file management, like in Series 60, is provided in the Applications and Gallery folders and subfolders. Gallery is also the default location for files transferred over Bluetooth to be placed. User-installed applications on Series 40 are generally mobile Java applications. Flash Lite applications are also supported, but mostly used for screensavers.\n\nThe integrated web browser can access most web content through the service provider's XHTML/HTML gateway. The latest version of Series 40, called Series 40 6th Edition, introduced a new browser based on the WebKit open source components WebCore and JavaScriptCore. The new browser delivers support for HTML 4.01, CSS2, JavaScript 1.5, and Ajax. Also, like the higher-end Series 60, Series 40 can run the UC Browser web browser to enhance the user's web browsing experience. The latest feature phones from the Asha lineup come with the Nokia Xpress Browser which uses proxy servers to compress and optimize web pages in a similar fashion as Opera Mini.\n\nSupport for SyncML synchronization of the address book, calendar and notes with external services is present. However, with many S40 phones, these synchronization settings must be sent via an OTA text message.\n\nSeries 40 is an embedded software platform that is open for software development via standard or de facto content and application development technologies. It supports Java MIDlets, i.e. Java MIDP and CLDC technology, which provide location, communication, messaging, media, and graphics capabilities. S40 also supports Flash Lite applications.\n\n-1.0: nokia 1680\n-2.0: nokia 2220,2320,2323,2330,2355,2600,2610,2626,2630,2650,2660,2680,2710,2720,2730,2855i,2865,2865i,\n\nThe following is a list of Series 40 devices released by Nokia:\n\n"}
{"id": "2271284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271284", "title": "Chapai Nawabganj District", "text": "Chapai Nawabganj District\n\nChapainawabganj (in Bengali: চাঁপাইনবাবগঞ্জ) is located on the north-western part of Bangladesh. It is a part of the Rajshahi Division and known for its special tone of local dialect. Initially, it was a sub-division of Malda district. In 1947, it was severed from Malda and was given to East Pakistan as a sub-division of Rajshahi district. It became a separate district of Bangladesh in 1984. The north and west part of Chapai Nawabganj is bounded by Malda and Murshidabad district of India, east is by Naogaon District, and south-east is by Rajshahi District.\n\nThe name \"Chapainawabganj\" is not very old. Before 2001, it was known as only Nawabganj or Nobabganj. In the pre-British or British-raj era, this place was a vacation spot for the nawabs of Murshidabad and Daudpur Mouja was the particular place of their vacation. The nawabs, \"Nobab\"'s, used to come here for hunting. That's why this place was known as \"Nobabganj\" as Ganj means place. It is believed that the Nawab of Bengal (Bangla-Bihar and Udissa) Sarfaraz Khan (1739–1740 AD) once came here for hunting and built a tent to this place. From then, this place is known as Nobabganj. But most of the researchers believe that during the reign of Alivardi Khan (1740–56 AD), this place was given the name Nobabganj.\n\nAt the start and middle of 18th century, people afraid of British rule, migrated from Kolkata to here to a great extent and made this a very busy populated place. There was a post office at that time which was located in the village named \"Chapai\". This migration led to the enlargement of the village 'Chapai'. The place was known widely as Chapai Nawabganj.\n\nThere is no strong historical proof about the name of this place but people usually believe in two different sources of the name of this place.\n\nChapainawabganj was one of the sub-divisions of the former Rajshahi zilla. Chapai Nawabganj was part of ancient Gour capital. It is said that this area had strategic and commercial importance due to its location at the junction of the rivers Mahananda and the Ganges. Because of its importance, Alivardi Khan founded Nowabganj town which in course of time known as Nawabganj. Until 1947, Nawabganj was a thana under Malda district, India.\n\nThe gateway of North Bengal, Malda was once the capital of Gour-Banga, with 3456 km² of land classified as Tal, Diara, and Barind. Malda awaits the advent of tourists and people of archaeological interest with its wealth to be enjoyed and its huge potential to be explored.\n\nThis portion of the earth is washed by the waves of the rivers Ganges, Mahananda, Fulahar, and Kalindri. It has witnessed different empires which were raised, flourished, and then cast down near oblivion by a successor kingdom built up on the relics of its predecessor. Panini mentioned a city named Gourpura, which by strong reason may be identified as the city of Gouda, ruins of which are situated in this district. Examples are legion of the relic of a predecessor kingdom being used in the monuments of the successor kingdoms. It had been within the limits of ancient 'Gaur' and 'Pandua' (Pundrabardhana).\n\nThese two cities had been the capital of Bengal in ancient and medieval ages. The boundary of Gour was changed in different ages since 5th century BC. Its name can be found in Puranic texts. Pundranagar was the provincial capital of Maurya Empire. Gour and Pundrabardhana formed parts of the Mourya empire as is evinced from the inscriptions, Brahmilipi on a seal discovered from the ruins of Mahasthangarh in the Bogra District of Bangladesh. Hiuen Tsang saw many Ashokan stupas at Pundrabardhana. The inscriptions discovered in the district of undivided Dinajpur and other parts of North Bengal along with the Allahabad Pillar inscriptions of Samudragupta clearly indicate that the whole of North Bengal as far east as Kamrup formed a part of the Gupta empire.\n\nAfter the Guptas in the early 7th century AD, king Sasanka of Karnasubarna as well as the king of Gaur ruled independently for more than three decades. From the middle of 8th century to the end of 11th century, the Pala Empire ruled Bengal and the kings were devoted to Buddhism. It was during their reign that the Jagadalla Vihara (monastery) in Barindri flourished paralleling with Nalanda, Vikramshila, and Devikot. The Pala Dynasty yielded to the emergence of Sena Empire. The Sen rulers were Hindus and in the habit of moving from place to place within their kingdom. At the time of Lakshman Sen Gour was known as Lakshmanabati. The Sen kings ruled Bengal till Bakhtiyar Khilji conquered Bengal in 1204 AD. Thereafter the Muslim rule lasted for about five hundred years. Sirajuddaulah was defeated by Lord Clive at the battle of Plassey in 1757, which marked the beginning of British rule. From ancient times, rulers of various origins, religions, and dynasties left imprints of their times on the earth in this district. Those who left ruins and relics speak of past pomp and grandeur, and hold interest for archaeologists and tourists.\n\nThis district, Malda, formed in 1813 out of the outlying areas of Purnia, Dinajpur, and Rajshahi districts. At the time of Dr. B. Hamilton (1808–09), the presents thanas of Gazole, Malda, Bamongola, and part of Habibpur were included in the district of Dinajpur and the thanas of Harischandrapur, Kharba, Ratua, Manikchak, and Kaliachak were included in the district of Purnia. In 1813, in consequence of the prevalence of serious crimes in the Kaliachak and Sahebganj thanas and also on the rivers, a joint magistrate and deputy collector were appointed at English Bazar with jurisdiction over a number of police stations centred around that place and taken from the two district. Thus the district of Malda was born.\n\nThe year 1832 saw the establishment of a separate treasury, and in 1859 a full-fledged magistrate and collector was posted. Up to 1876 this district formed part of Rajshahi Division, and from 1876 to 1905 it formed part of Bhagalpur Division. In 1905, it was again transferred to Rajshahi Division, and until 1947 Malda remained in this division. In August 1947 this district was affected by the Partition of India. Between 12 and 15 August 1947 whether the district would become part of India or Pakistan was unknown, as the announcement of the Radcliffe Line did not make this point clear. During these few days the district was under a magistrate of East Pakistan until the details of the Radcliffe award were published and the district became part of West Bengal on 17 August 1947. Five thanas were given to Pakistan under the district of Rajshahi which later formed as Chapai Nawabganj.\n\nChapainawabganj is the most western district of Bangladesh. Rajshahi and Naogaon is on the east, while on the Indian side is Malda of West Bengal, the rest of India is on the north. Western side is surrounded by the river Padma and Malda district and Murshidabad of West Bengal (India), India is on the southern side. Chapai Nawabganj is situated between the latitude 24'22 to 24'57 and longitude 87'23 to 88'23.\n\nChapainawabganj District (Rajshahi division) has an area of 1702.55 km. Many rivers flows over this area. The main rivers are the Ganges, and Mahananda. Most of the land of this area are plain land with many small ponds and water reservoirs. But, recently, the geography has changed due to the erosion by the river Padma (Ganges). Overload of river sediment caused by farrakka barrage eroded the river banks and created a large area of land full of sand which almost looks like a small desert in this area. Four to five small union parisad like narayonpur, johurpur, sundorpur, baghdanga has shifted to the other side of the river Padma.\n\nBased on formation of soil, Chapai Nawabganj can be divided into two different parts 1. Borendra area and 2. Diyar area.\n\nThe east part of the river Mohananda is part of Borind Track and known as borendra area. Borendra area is one of the oldest well known areas not only in Bangladesh but also all over the sub-continent. Borendra area was formed during the formation of the triangle of Bengal. Chapai Nawabganj sadar, part of Gomostapur upozilla and Nachol constitutes the borendra area. The main crops of this area is the rice.\n\nThe region in the river Padma basin is known as diyar. The area formed for the continuous change of path of the river Padma. The soil of this area are very fertile and people can cultivate multiple times a year of different type of crops. Main crops are rice, wheat, melons– the most famous corn is Kalai. Mango gardens are increasing rapidly beside these crops now. This area was also famous for the cultivation of neel and reshom.\n\nThe Ganges river originates in the Himalayas and flows through Northern and Eastern India. This river then enters into Bangladesh at Shibganj and takes the name Padma. The Farakka Barrage was built 10 miles upstream of where Padma enters into Bangladesh which decreased the water level of Padma. But still in rainy season, this river becomes very dangerous as the water level grows high and floods the area nearby.\n\nMahananda River entered to this district through Bholahat upozilla and flows through the district and finally falls to the river Padma at Godagari, Rajshahi district. Nawabganj town is situated on the bank of this river and the economy of this district is driven by this river too.\nThe Pagla River also flows from India and enters into Bangladesh in this district at Tattipur, Moraganga (dead gangis). After flowing a few miles, it mixes with the river Mahananda.\n\nThe Punarbhaba River flows through Dinajpur and Naogoan of Bangladesh and then enters into Chapainawabganj.\n\nChapainabganj is very close to the big city Rajshahi and the climate of both districts are very close. Under Köppen climate classification, Rajshahi has a tropical wet and dry climate. The climate of Rajshahi is generally marked with monsoons, high temperature, considerable humidity and moderate rainfall. The hot season commences early in March and continues till the middle of July. The maximum mean temperature observed is about during the months of April, May, June and July and the minimum temperature recorded in January is about . The highest rainfall is observed during the months of monsoon. The annual rainfall in the district is about .\n\nAccording to 2011 census report, Chapainawabganj had a population of 1,647,521. Among them, 810,218 are male and 837,303 are female. More than 310,000 lives in urban area and 968 people lives per km.. The growth rate is 1.44 which is below the average rate in Bangladesh.\n\nAccording to 2011 Bangladesh census, in Chapainawabganj District, Muslims formed 95.36% of the population, Hindus 4.04%, Christians 0.35% and others 0.25%. Chapaimawabganj District had a literacy rate of 39.38% for the population 7 years and above.\n\nChapainawabganj has only one university at its boro indara moor. Exim Bank Agricultural University Bangladesh (EBAUB) was established in 2013 to provide students of this area with education specializing in Agriculture. It is also providing undergraduate degree in Agricultural Economics, Business Administration and Law. Along with Nawabganj Govt. College and Shah Neyamotullah College, EXIM Bank Agricultural University is considered to be the pinnacle of educational institutions in this district.\n\nFew notable college in Chapainawabganj District\n\nThe students and teachers origin from Chapainawabganj formed a committee named 'Chapainawabganj Somiti' in many institutions out of Chapainawabganj.\n\nThis district is mainly a plain land with rivers. The whole district is full of fertile land with proper irrigation facilities. That is why the economy is totally dependent on agriculture. But as there are a number of rivers flowing through this district, and many people depend on fishing and other related activities.\n\nChapainawabganj is called the capital of the mango in Bangladesh because it is this summer fruit that is the main product that sustains the economy of this district. Most of the land of this district is full of mango orchards where various kinds of mango are produced. The economy is surrounded by the production of the mango in this district. The main part of mango production is the Shibganj, Bholahat and Gamostapur upazila.\n\nGombhira gaan is a kind of folk song popular in this district.\n\nNow-a-days, Gambhira reflects contemporary social problems through witty dialogue, songs, dances and jokes. This is the main part in any cultural celebration in this district with great entertainment and explanation of social problems.\n\nThe people of Chapainawabganj use the Bangla language but they have their own dialect. The dialect constitutes of different tone as well as different words than to standard Bangla language.\n\nThe district of Chapainawabganj consists of 1987 mosques, 474 temples, 56 Buddhist temples and 28 churches. Chotto Sona Mosque, Chapai Mosque, 15th century Darashbari Mosque, etc. are famous mosques. Jora Math is the famous Buddhist monastery and Naoda Stupa is the Buddhist monument.\n\nOne of the most graceful monument of the Sultanate period is the Chhota Sona Masjid or Sona Mosque at Gaur in Chapainawabganj Built by one Wali Muhammad during the reign of Sultan Alauddin Husain Shah (1493–1519). Originally it was roofed over with 15 gold-gilded domes including the 3 Chauchala domes in the middle row, from which it derives its curious name. By the side of this mosque great martyr Birsrestha Captain Mohiuddin Jahangir laid in peace.\nChapainawabganj district comprises five Upazilas:\n\nThere are four municipalities\n\nThis district is the most western district in Bangladesh which has boundary with the neighboring country India. And for importing and exporting, there is a land port in this district which makes this district an important route for communicating with the neighboring country. And the construction of the Jamuna Bridge at Sirajganj also makes its transportation system an important one all over the country. That is why highways were constructed over the district. The major transport systems inside the town is the bike, rickshaws, bi-cycle and CNG rickshaws.\nThe major transportation system in this town is the bus service to different districts and towns. The main transportation route is Nawabganj-Rajshahi. The bus transportation service is off three types which are \"gate-lock\", direct and local service. The others bus routes are Nawabganj-Shibganj, Nawabganj-Naogaon, Nawabganj-Nachol, Nawabganj-Rohanpur. The BRTC bus service serves for the long intra-district route to almost all important districts of Bangladesh. The most important long route is the Nawabganj-Dhaka. This route has ample bus service. There are two bus stoppages. The biggest one is called Chapai Nawabganj Bus Terminal and the other is the Dhaka Bus Terminal. Sona Mosjid-Rajshahi-Sona Mosjid bus Service are on at7.15am to 5.15 pm every 1 hour after.\n\nThere are limited railway services with Rohanpur and Rajshahi. One of the international rail line passes through the district to Malda, West Bengal, India. There are few services of local train from different stations of Chapainawabganj such as Nawabganj Sadar, Amnura, Nachole, Nijampur, Rahanpur to Rajshahi and other parts of Bangladesh and also has a shuttle service from Nawabganj to Rajshahi for the intercity train service from Rajshahi to other part of Bangladesh.chapai nawabgonj Railway\n\nIn the past, the main transport system was based on the water path. The river Padma (Ganges), Mahananda River, Pagla, Punorvoba, Moraganga and some \"beel\"s (marshland) were used for intra-district transport system. The water level went down due to adverse effect of Farakka Barrage on Padma (Ganges) river, and therefore, water transport has lost its popularity. But still rivers are used for transportation of daily goods from different parts of the district. Still the transportation from the villages in western and eastern parts of the district depends on the boat. In the Shibgonj Upozila have a small river named Pagla.\n\n\nThere are a few number of daily, weekly and monthly publications in Bengali. The important dailies are \"Doinik Chapai Dristi\",\"Saptahik Chapai Protidin\",\"Saptahik Sonamasjid\" and \"Dainik Chapai Dorpon\" \"Daily ChapaiChetro\" \"Chapai Barta\" \"Saptahik Bholahat\" \"Saptahik Gourbarta\" etc.\n\n"}

It is a part of the Rangpur Division. It is about 400 kilometres to the northwest of the capital Dhaka. It has an area of . Nilphamari is bounded by Rangpur and Lalmonirhat in east, Rangpur and Dinajpur in south, Dinajpur and Panchagarh in west, Cooch Behar of India in north. There are many rivers in Nilphamari such as the Tista, Buritista, Isamoti, Jamuneshwari, Dhum, Kumlai, Charalkata, Sorbomongola, Salki, Chikli, Deonai and many more.\n\nAbout 200 years ago, the British established farms for cultivating indigo (\"nil\"). The soil of this area was very fertile for indigo cultivation. As a result, a lot of and (farm) were built here compared to the other districts. It is widely believed that the term \"\" was derived from \"\" by the local farmers. And then the word \"Nilphamari\" was derived from \"Nil khamari\".\n\nNilphamari was previously under the Rajshahi division. The Nilphamari subdivision was established in 1875.\nIt was a subdivision of the Rangpur District. It was turned into a district in 1984. The district consists of 3 municipalities, 33 wards, 65 , 62 union , 390 and 370 villages.\n\nThe historical Tebhaga movement spread over Domar and Dimla of this district in the 1940s. Indigo used to be cultivated extensively in this district. Syedpur is best known for its railway workshop. In 1870, the Assam-Bengal railway set up its largest workshop in Syedpur and many Biharis or Urdu-speakers came to work there. During the British rule the telephone exchange for the whole Assam-Bengal District was also situated in Syedpur, and it was the third-largest city of Bangladesh after Dhaka and Chittagong. Syedpur had the first airport in North Bengal. There was also a cantonment during the British period.\n\nSource: Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (Census 2011).\n\nNilphamari has an agriculture-based economy.

It is a part of the Rangpur Division and borders India to the west. It was established as a mahakuma in 1860 consisting of 6 thanas named Thakurgaon sadar, Baliadangi, Pirganj, Ranishankail, Haripur and Ruhia. In 1947, it was re-established as a mahakuma including 3 thanas of Jalpaiguri and a thana of kochbihar of India. In 1981, Atoari was included in the new Panchagarh district and the area was shrunk in just 5 thanas. It was then established as a district in 1 February 1984.\n\nThere are 5 upazilas, 6 thanas, 53 unions, 647 mouzas and 1016 villages in Thakurgaon. The Upazilas in this district are:\n\nThere is also another Pirganj upazila under Rangpur district\n\nThe Thana in this district are:\n\nThe area of Thakurgaon is . Thakurgaon is in the north west corner of Bangladesh, it is about 467 km from Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. It is surrounded by Dinajpur district on its south, Panchagarh district to the east and India on its west and north sides, it is a part of the Himalayan plain land. Highest average temperature of this district is 33.5° Celsius and lowest average is 10.05° Celsius.\n\nDuring British rule Thakurgaon was a tehsil (a district subdivision). In 1947 at the time of the Partition of India, Thakurgaon Subdivision became part of the newly established Dinajpur District of East Bengal. In 1984 Takurgaon subdivision was split off Dinajpur and became a separate district (i.e. Thakurgaon District). Before 1879 Thakurgaon District was ruled my Maithil Brahmins and Bengali Brahmins like Bikhash Jha, Barun Thakur and Vidhenesh Roy, Until 1947 Thakurgaon district had a just Hindu majority population of 52%.Most people believe thakurgaon district has got its name from Barun Thakur a maithil Brahmin.\n\nIn Bangladesh as a whole agriculture is the basis of the economy, and Thakurgaon has been striving for a long time to be economically productive, agriculture forming a major part of the districts economy. Thakurgaon produces many agricultural products, such as rice, wheat, sugarcane, seasonal vegetables and fruits etc. The sugarcane plantation - TSM (Thakurgaon Sugar Mill)--is part of the BSFIC. These become the main livelihood of the native. Poultry firms are quite productive business in Thakurgaon, there are several cold-stores in the district. Different businesses for producing and repairing agricultural tools have grown up.\n\nHowever the community's distance from the capital causes difficulties in getting sufficient technical and logistic support and in transporting local products to the national market. It is not easy for the investors to set up their business far away from the center of national trade and commerce.\n\nThere are various places of interest in the district, these include:\n\nThere is a versatile practice of culture in the district; few festivals and cultural events are regularly arranged there. \"Alpona Sansad\" arranges \"Boishakhi Mela\" in every Bangla new year. Held \"Eid Fair\" at the occasion of Eid-Ul-Adha & Eid-Ul-Fitre every year at Thakurgaon Boro Matth also. Several drama clubs (Sapla Natto Gosty-Estd.1974, Nischintopur Theater-1983 etc. ) practice and perform regularly and stage original and famous dramas every month. Dhamer Gaan is a unique traditional cultural invention of Thakurgaon people. The existing 10 tribes in this area enjoy their own heritage and cultural practices.\n\n\nThana- Haripur\n"}

The airfield at Araxos became the first foothold, being captured on 23 September 1944 and many airfields around it were secured within a month, including Megara taken by parachute landings of 4 Para. Near Athens, Kalamaki ultimately became the center of RAF activity, renamed Hassani on 1 December 1944, as home for No. 337 Wing RAF, under which operated a number of squadrons:\n\n\nThese were bolstered by the arrival in November 1944 of No. 335 Squadron RHAF and No. 336 Squadron RHAF. Both of these were Greek manned units within the RAF and would become the first operational units of the Royal Hellenic Air Force. Both flew the Spitfire VB fighter.\n\nSedes was opened with the liberation of northern Greece and became the new home for No. 32 Sqn.\n\nOn 2 December 1944, tensions over the role of the EAM and ELAS parties in post-war government resulted in demonstration during which British forces opened fire, killing ten civilians. The response was attacks on police stations and thus RAF units began operations against ELAS and EAM targets, mostly around Athens. No. 73 Sqn, along with the newly arrived No. 94 Squadron RAF, used their Spitfires on strafing runs and light bombing was undertaken by No. 108 Sqn. Additional options were gained when a flight of Beaufighters of No. 39 Squadron RAF were attached to No. 108 Sqn., armed with RP-3 rockets. These were considered very effective and over the span of two weeks 105 targets (55 buildings, 19 command posts, 10 supply dumps, 2 radio stations, 12 transportation, and 7 artillery) were struck by these aircraft. The regular aircraft of No. 108 flew 265 sorties during December. The heavy bombers of No. 221 Sqn were primarily used in supply flights to the Sedes facility as well as various leaflet and illumination missions. Two actual bombing raids were carried out (both at night). The Greek Spitfire squadrons did not participate in the attacks, although the newly formed No. 13 Squadron RHAF did assist in leaflet operations.\n\nThe RAF suffered a major blow with the attack by ELAS troops on their facility at Kifisia, which was home to Allied Headquarters Greece, on 19 December 1944. The No. 2933 Squadron RAF Regiment defended strongly but was ultimately overrun with the capture of many British prisoners. No. 221 Sqn. conducted supply drops to these personnel during their march north. By 7 January 1945, Athens was secured, and a ceasefire negotiated on 11 January. While some fighting continued, British fighter squadrons were withdrawn by summer 1945. Hassani continued to be a hub of RAF operations however the arrival of No. 252 Wing RAF with three Douglas Boston V equipped units, No. 13 Squadron RAF, No. 18 Squadron RAF, and No. 55 Squadron RAF.\n\n1946 saw the official transfer of Greek manned RAF squadrons into the Royal Hellenic Air Force. In addition to the aforementioned Nos. 13, 335, and 336 Sqns., these also included the No. 355 Squadron RHAF with a variety of transport types, including the C-47, Avro Anson, and Wellington and the 345, 346, and 347 Flights using the Auster AOP and other utility aircraft for liaison.\n\nMeanwhile, government opposition was on the rise and the formation of the Democratic Army of Greece led to the loss of control of much of rural Greece. The Greek National Army responded with Operation Terminus, but this was a failure. March 1948 saw the RHAF enter the action with attacks on landing strips set up by Communist forces to receive aid from Albania and Yugoslavia. Involvement by the United States led to the launch of Operation Dawn in April 1948, and this was supported by RHAF units with a total of 641 sorties with the loss of one Spitfire plus damage to ten more. Dakotas were utilized for leaflet and supply operations. The operation was successful but the withdrawal to northern border regions limited RHAF effectiveness due to a five-mile stop line to avoid an international incident.\n\nOperation Coronis was launched in July 1948 against enemy forces in the Grammos Mountains with the support of Nos. 335 and 336 Sqns. operating from Yannina and Kozani. Additional aircraft included AT-6 Texan and Auster aircraft. Ultimate results were a draw as anti-government forces withdrew across the border to Albania. No. 337 Squadron RHAF had been formed with Spitfire IX aircraft, giving the RHAF three Spitfire units. For heavier bombing, Dakotas were jury-rigged with racks for bombs up to 500 lb each. RAF deHavilland Mosquito photo reconnaissance aircraft were reportedly used in the affair. RHAF flew 3,474 sorties during the operation, suffering one lost Spitfire plus a further 22 damaged.\n\nOperations in September 1948 centered on the Vitsi Mountains area, and were supported again by the RHAF. They were marked by better cooperation with GNA units and the first use of napalm, although this was not used heavily. These operations lasted through the end of the year, bringing the grand total of sorties for 1948 to 8,907 combat and 9,891 transport, with the loss of twelve airmen. A major attack at Florina by guerrilla forces was defeated with significant air support by the RHAF.\n\nAugust 1949 marked the final series of operations against the guerrilla forces, and again the RHAF played a large role in supporting government forces. In particular, during the final portion of the month, No. 336 Sqn. began employing its newly acquired Curtiss SB2C Helldiver aircraft, of which 40 had been acquired from the United States Navy. This operation resulted in the final destruction of opposition military resistance and resulted in a final ceasefire being signed. During August 826 sorties had been flown dropping 288 tons of bombs and firing 1935 rockets. Napalm was used again, with 114 such strikes being made.\n\n\nThe Royal Air Force maintained a sizable presence in Greece from the liberation of Greece in September 1944 through the creation of the RHAF in 1946.\n\n\nThe South African Air Force had a limited deployment to Greece which was withdrawn shortly before the end of World War II.\n\n\nThe Royal Hellenic Air Force was formed from Greek units of the RAF in 1946 and by the end of that year had assumed sole duties from the RAF for the country.\n\n\n"}

Between the thirteenth and early seventeenth centuries, Habiganj was part of the state of Nasirabad, now called Mymensingh. At present, it is a district of Sylhet Division.\n\nWith the passage of time, Habibganj turned into Habiganj. During the British Raj, Habiganj was established as a Thana (police precinct) in 1790, under Dhaka district (1779–1793). Until 1896, Habiganj's administrative centre was in Court Andar, Laskarpur. On 12 September 1874 it came under Sylhet district (part of Assam). Habiganj was declared as subdivision in 1867. On 7 April 1893, according to Notification #273 of Assam Provincial Government, Habiganj Thana (Administrative unit) was established. Habiganj was rejoined with East-Bengal (now Bangladesh) in 1911. Then the Office of the Circle Officer (Development) was established in 1960. On 1 March 1984 Habiganj was established as a District. Md. Kamrul Hasan is the Deputy Commissioner.\n\nAt present Habiganj consists of 9 upazilas, 6 municipalities, 54 wards, 78 union parishads, 124 mahallas, 1241 mouzas and 2076 villages.\n\nAll the reported prehistoric records of Bangladesh are associated with the Lalmai hills and the higher areas of Sylhet, Habiganj, and Chittagong and Madhupur tract. The prehistoric site of Chaklapunji tea garden, near Chandirmazar of Chunarughat. Habiganj has also revealed a significant number of prehistoric tools from the bed of a small ephemeral stream (water remains here only for a few hours after rainfall) known as Balu nadi (river). Angularity and freshness of the fossil wood artifacts suggest that they did not come from a great distance and probably came from nearby hillocks. Typologically, technologically, and morphometrically, the artifacts are more or less the same as those found in the Lalmai area. The Fossil wood assemblages of Lalmai and Chaklapunji can be classified into two groups:\n\nFrom the time of the conquest of Sylhet and Taraf by Muslim s in 1302-22 A .D ., to the time o f the annexation of the territory of Sylhet to the Mughal Empire in 1612 A.D . little is known with any certainty about this ruling power in the district, excepting that Amar Manikya (1577–86) king of Tripura raj while digging a tank in his capital called upon Syed Musa, son o f Syed Shah Mikail to contribute laborers. Syed Musa refused to accept this subordination and Tripurah claim. Tripura King attacked Taraf and a battle took place at Jilkua village to the south of Chunarghat in which Syed Musa and his son Bairam were taken prisoner in 1581 A.D . Syed Musa suffered imprisonment in Tripura capital but Syed Bairam was set free. By the middle of the 15th century, when all the divisions of the Laur territory were united under the headship of Baniachung house (now of Muslim faith) it seems the Muslim area of Taraf passed under the control of Baniachung, which now became very powerful to include in its territory, the whole of present Sunamganj and Habiganj subdivisions.\n\nIn Baniachang a battle occurred between Anwar Khan (the Zamindar of Sylhet) and Hussain Khan (Baro-Bhuyans of Baniachang) with the Mughal army in the 17th century, which can be found in the \"Bahrastan-i-Gayebi\".\n\nKhwaja Usman fled Bukai Nagar Fort and established a shelter at Putijuri on the foot of the Giripal. He also established a fort at Putijuri, which was extremely important for defense. The Mughal army took the advantage when Khwaja Osman's brother was absent from the fort, and finally defeated the Khwaja Osman's army at the village called Dhalamvapur, Maulvi Bazar District.\n\nIn the second session of the Congress held in Calcutta in 1886, the Indian National Congress was able to attract representatives from Habiganj District.\n\nHabiganj is the historical place where the Mukti Bahini started their first guerrilla movement against oppression of Pakistani Army.\n\nOn 4 April 1971, during Bangladesh Liberation War the senior army officers assembled at the headquarters of 2nd East Bengal at Teliapara, a semi hilly area covered by tea gardens where General MAG Osmani, Lieutenant Colonel Abdur Rob, Lieutenant Colonel Salahuddin Mohammad Reja, Major Kazi Nuruzzaman, Major Khaled Mosharraf, Major Nurul Islam, Major Shafat Jamil, Major Mainul Hossain Chowdhury, and others were present.\n\nAt this meeting four senior commanders were entrusted with the responsibility of operational areas. Sylhet-Brahmanbaria area was placed under the command of Major Shafiullah, Comilla-Noakhali area was given to Major Khaled Mosharraf while Chittagong-Chittagong Hill Tracts was given to Major Ziaur Rahman and Kushtia-Jessore area was placed under command of Major Abu Osman Chowdhury. In the meeting the organization concept of the freedom fighter forces and the command structure were chalked out under the command of General MAG Osmani.\n\nDuring the War of Liberation in 1971 an 18 hours direct encounter between the freedom-fighters and the Pakistani-army was held on 16 November 1971, in which freedom-fighter Jagatyoti and 11 villagers were killed by the Pakistani-army.\n\nAs per district administration report the total population is 2,089,001 of 926,531 male and 904,022 female (50.6% male and 49.4% female).

The Royal family of the Debbarma ruled the state of Tripura for more than 2,000 years till the kingdom was joined with the India in 1949.\n\nThe original Meitei homeland is Manipur, once a sovereign state and now the north-eastern state of India. In the early days, Manipur had different names such as Kangleipak, Kangkleipang, Kanglei, Meitrabak, and Mekhali. During the reign of Maharaj Garibniwaz (1709–1748), Meiteis arrived here. The Khasia is a Mongolite ethnic group. The Khasi descended to the Khasia hills and Jaintia hills from Cherrapunji and Shilong regions.

It is bordered by the Indian states of Tripura and Assam to the south and east, respectively; and by the Bangladeshi districts of Habiganj to the west and Sylhet to the north.\n\nThe name of the district, Moulvibazar is named after its headquarter town, Moulvibazar. The word is derived from two words, moulvi and bazar, meaning 'Market of the Moulvi'. 'Moulvi' is an Islamic honorific title and 'bazar' is the Bengali word for market or township. Moulvibazar is named after Moulvi Syed Qudratullah, a local judge and a descendant of Shah Mustafa, an Islamic preacher active during the advent of Islam in the region. It is believed that the name was coined in the 1771 when Syed Qudratullah established a small bazaar on his zamindari land and local people named it as Moulvibazar. This market was established at riverside of the present Poschim Bazar (West Market), which gradually expanded over the time.\n\nCopper plates has been found from 930 AD in Paschimbagh, Tengubazar Mandir, Rajnagar and one of Raja Marundanath from the 11th century in Kalapur, Srimangal. The district was also part of the ancient Kamarupa kingdom. It is suggested that the area was inhabited by Buddhists and Hindus as evidence from inscriptions suggests there was an ancient university in Panchgaon, Rajnagar. The terrain was headquarters of the ancient \"Ita Kingdom\" founded by Raja Bhanu Narayan and its capital was in the villages of Bhumiura and Eolatoli. Other regions included Chandrapur or Chandrarajya which is modern-day Moulvibazar Sadar.\n\nAfter the Conquest of Sylhet in 1303, many disciples of Shah Jalal scattered across the Sylhet region and the rest of Bengal. Shah Mustafa of Baghdad, a descendant of Abdul Qadir Gilani, migrated to Chandrapur ruled by Raja Chandra Singh where he lived on top of a small hill with his son Syed Ismail and would preach to the local people. Mustafa would eventually succeed Singh as the ruler of Chandrapur after marrying the Raja's daughter. Other Sufi disciples and saints who preached in Moulvibazar included Shah Kala, Haji Rasul, Shah Dorong, Helimuddin Nurnali, Hamid Faruqi, Syed Nasrullah, Syed Yasin, Syed Ismail, Nur Ali Shah, Shah Wali Muhammad, Sheikh Shihabuddin, Sabur Shah, Shah Helal and Shah Kamaluddin.\n\nThe final raja of the Ita Kingdom, Raja Subid Narayan lost a battle in 1610 in which the region became under the rule of Khwaja Usman, a fierce opponent of the Mughal Empire. He then established his new capital in Uhar, Kamalganj and managed to gain control of South Sylhet. However, this rule was short-lived after Mughal General Islam Khan I's attack in 1612. An important battle between the Mughal Empire and the Baro-Bhuyans was held in Pathan Ushar, Kamalganj. This led to the death of Afghan leader Khwaja Usman.\n\nThe Panchgaon Factory in Rajnagar Upazila produced cannons for the Mughal Empire. The famous \"Jahan Kosha Cannon\", built by Janardan Karmakar remains in display in Dhaka.\n\nAfter the Battle of Plassey in 1757, the British gave the region surrounding Moulvibazar high importance, especially in tea production. A rebellion against the permanent settlement of the British took place in Latu in 1857. On 1 April 1882, the area was declared a sub-division, or mahakuma, and named \"South Srihatta\" (and later \"South Sylhet\"), consisting of 26 parganas. A mass deforestation took place from 1898 to 1899, clearing the Longla-Singla Reserve in order to make space for settlements.\n\nIn 1912, there was an anti-British protest held in the village of Jagatshi in the Sadar Upazila. It was organised by Swami Dayananda having its seat at Dolgovinda Ashram. In 1921, the anti-British Khilafat Movement also spread to Moulvibazar and campaigners that were present included Chittaranjan Das, Hussain Ahmed Madani and Sarojini Naidu. On the same year, the non-cooperation movement also spread here after being established by Purnendu Kishore Sengupta in Vidia Ashram, Rangirkul, Kulaura. The peasant rebellion led by Panchanan Singh, Qasim Ali, Baikuntha Sharma and Themba Singh was also held in the 1900s in Vanubal, Kamalganj. In 1960, the South Sylhet sub-division was renamed as Moulvibazar by the mahakuma administrator Dr M A Sattar.\n\nArmed resistance begun at the village of Srirainagar in Kanakpur on 27 March 1971. The Pakistani army was said to have made a surprise attack on the procession there in which two people were killed. On 20 December, a number of people were killed and wounded by mine explosions at the premises of the Moulvibazar Government High School.\n\nOn 22 February 1984, the President of Bangladesh, H M Ershad, upgraded its sub-division status to a district as a part of his decentralisation programme. Shakir Uddin Ahmed was made the district's inaugural deputy commissioner whilst Mukhleshur Rahman was made the first district police super.\n\nMoulvibazar is in Sylhet, a district to the North-East of Bangladesh. It is 2,707 km² in area, and has a population of 1.38 million. It is situated between 24.10 degree 24.35 degree north latitude and between 90.35 degree and 91.20-degree east longitude. It is surrounded by Sylhet District in the north, Habiganj District in the west and Indian states of Assam and Tripura in the east and south respectively.\n\nThe main rivers of the district are the Manu, the Dholoi and the Juri which flow from India. Every year during the rainy season, when there is excessive rainfall in India, the surplus water flows through these rivers and causes floods in low-lying parts of Moulvibazar (for example, the villages of Balikhandi and Shampashi on the northern side of the river Manu). Unless the rivers are properly dredged the floods can be devastating.\n\nIn the last few years Moulvibazar has had a muti-million dollar flood defence system built, which is the only one like it in the whole country.\n\nMoulvibazar is made up of 7 subdivisions or upazilas. They are:\n\nThere are 67 Unions, 2,064 Villages and 5 Pourashavas namely Kamalganj, Kulaura, Sreemongal, Barlekha and Moulvibazar. Almost 50,000 of the clan population belong to Manipuri, Khasia and Tripura clans. They tend to live in the areas of Kamalganj, Sreemongal and Kulaura Upazila of this district. There are 92 tea gardens in the district.\n\nDuring the British colonial period, South Sylhet subdivision was divided into three tax collectory zilas, further divided into 28 parganas. The incomplete list of parganas of South Sylhet are as follows:\n\nLater on, South Sylhet subdivision was divided into five thanas:\n\nThe main exports of Moulvibazar are bamboo, tea, pineapple, cane, jackfruit, oranges, agar, rubber, mangoes and lemons. Ninety-one of Bangladesh's 153 tea gardens are located in Moulvibazar. The area is also home to the three largest tea gardens (size and production wise) in the world. Pineapples from the Sreemangal area are famous for their flavour and natural sweetness. Srimangal is known as the 'tea capital of Bangladesh' due to the high frequency of tea plantations found there.\n\nThe district of Moulvibazar consists 2967 mosques, 613 temples, 56 churches and 22 Buddhist temples. Notable mosques include the Mosque of Shah Mustafa, Goyghor Mosque, Jiladpur Mosque, and the Lawachara Jame Mosque. The revivalist Deobandi movement is popular in with Jamia Luthfia Anwarul Uloom Hamidnagar being a notable centre in Srimangal and many are part of the Tablighi Jamaat.

It is a part of Khulna Division.\n\nNarail town was named after a feudal lord (a zamindar). The zamindars established a market at Roopgonj, also named after a zamindar. They established a post office for the first time in the district during British Raj near Rotongonj, named after another member of the feudal lord family. They modernised Narail, and promoted culture, sports and education.\n\nThe large playing field, Kuriddobe, was a gift of the feudal lord's family. They introduced football competition, with a shield given to the champions, a cup to the runners-up, and medals to all players from the early twentieth century.\n\nOne of the feudal lords moved away from Narail, settled in Hatbaria, and established another large manor (\"Jomidarbaari\").\n\nNarail District has an area of .

It is divided into three upazilas: Narail Sadar Upazila, Kalia Upazila and Lohagara Upazila. The upazilas are divided into Narail Sadar and Kalia municipalities, and 39 Union Parishads. These are subdivided into 18 wards, 43 mahallas, 445 mouzas, and 651 villages.\n\nNarail Victoria College and Collegiate School is one of the oldest modern high schools in Bangladesh, established in 1858 by the landlords of Narail who were proponents of education. They also established a girls' school, a rarity in Bangladesh at that time. This was the Shib Shankar Memorial Girls' School. This school closed down due to lack of funding after they left for India. It was reopened by some local enthusiasts, like J. Bhattacharjee, S. Biswas and B. Bhowmic. They borrowed furnishings from the neighbours. They went house to houses soliciting parents to send their children to the school.\n\nNarail Palace was one of the biggest landlord mansions in Bengal. When the Hindu landlords left for Kolkata after the partition of India, the mansion was looted and vandalised, and gradually collapsed. There are still some remains present, including the \"Kaalibaari\" (temple of goddess Kali), \"Shibmondir\" (temple of Shiva) and the \"Bandha ghaat\" on the River Chitra. Some local people continued the famous Durga Puja in the mansion, but this was discontinued after a few years. Part of the building was used for some time as a government office. Due to lack of maintenance, it gave in.\n\nKalia Palace was another large landlord mansions in Bengal. Some landlords lived in Naragati. Naragati was a thana in the British period. The predecessor of Robi Sankar & Uday Sankar lived in Kalia.\n\nThe famous writer Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay was a magistrate in Narail.

His fame rests on his striking depictions of exaggeratedly muscular farmers engaged in the activities of their everyday lives.[1] He is the son of Sheikh Mohammed Mecher Ali & Mochammed Meherunnesa.\n\nNarail was once declared \"independent\" from the British Raj by Shorola \"di\" (Sister Shorola), as she was known at the time by her followers of the independence movement of India. But this \"independence\" lasted for only three days.\n\nThe town of Narail is the road transport hub of the district. To the west it is connected by regional highway R750 to Jessore, about 32 km away. R720 runs north 50 km to Magura.

{"id": "2271362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271362", "title": "Dewan Negara", "text": "Dewan Negara\n\nThe Dewan Negara (Malay for \"Senate\", literally \"State Assembly\") is the upper house of the Parliament of Malaysia, consisting of 70 senators of whom 26 are elected by the state legislative assemblies, with two senators for each state, while the other 44 are appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King), including four who are appointed to represent the federal territories.\n\nThe \"Dewan Negara\" usually reviews legislation that has been passed by the lower house, the \"Dewan Rakyat\". All bills must usually be passed by both the \"Dewan Rakyat\" and the \"Dewan Negara\" (the Senate), before they are sent to the King for royal assent. However, if the \"Dewan Negara\" rejects a bill, it can only delay the bill's passage by a maximum of a year before it is sent to the King, a restriction similar to that placed on the House of Lords in the United Kingdom. Like the \"Dewan Rakyat\", the \"Dewan Negara\" meets at the Malaysian Houses of Parliament in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nOriginally, the Dewan Negara was meant to act as a check on the Dewan Rakyat and represent the interests of the various states, based on the role played by its counterpart in the United States. However, the original constitution, which provided for a majority of state-elected senators, has since been modified to make the vast majority of senators instead appointed by the King, thus theoretically providing an avenue for sombre, relatively non-partisan reconsideration of bills, more similar to the role of the British House of Lords.\n\nMembers of the Dewan Negara are referred to as \"Senators\" in English or \"\"Ahli Dewan Negara\"\" (literally \"member of the Dewan Negara\") in Malay. The term of office is 3 years and senators may only be re-appointed once, consecutively or non-consecutively.\n\nEach of the 13 state legislative assemblies chooses two senators. The King appoints two senators for the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, and one respectively for the Federal Territories of Labuan and Putrajaya on the advice of the Prime Minister.\n\nAnother 40 senators, regardless of their states, are appointed by the King, also on the Prime Minister's advice. Federally appointed senators must have \"rendered distinguished public service or have achieved distinction in the professions, commerce, industry, agriculture, cultural activities or social service or are representative of racial minorities or are capable of representing the interests of aborigines (Orang Asli)\".\n\nThe intent of the original Constitution of Malaysia, which provided for only 16 Senators to be appointed by the King (thus placing them in the minority) was to give the states some say over federal policy. However, subsequent amendments have, according to former Lord President of the Federal Court Tun Mohamed Suffian Mohamed Hashim, acted \"contrary to the spirit of the original constitution which established the Dewan Negara specially as a body to protect in the federal Parliament, state interests against federal encroachments\".\n\nTo qualify, a candidate must be a Malaysian citizen at least 30 years of age, residing in the Federation, must not owe allegiance to any foreign state, must not have received a prison sentence of one year or longer, and must not have been fined RM2,000 or more. Holders of a full-time profit-making position in the public service are also ineligible. There is no requirement to belong to a political party. Parliament is permitted to increase the number of Senators to three per state, reduce the number of appointed Senators, or abolish the post of appointed Senator altogether. The process of appointment is set out by Article 45 of the Constitution. The Constitution provides for direct election of the 26 Senators from the states, but this clause does not take effect until Parliament passes a resolution bringing it into effect; as of 2010, the Senators remain indirectly elected.\n\nSenators can be appointed to ministerial posts in the Cabinet by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on the advice of the Prime Minister. However, the Dewan Negara never supplies the Prime Minister, as the Prime Minister must be a member of the Dewan Rakyat.\n\nThe Dewan Negara is not affected by the elections for the Dewan Rakyat, and senators continue to hold office despite the Dewan Rakyat's dissolution for an election.\n\nThe Dewan Negara elects a President to preside over sittings of the Dewan Negara, ensure observance of the rules of the house, and interpret the Standing Orders of the house should they be disputed. Should the President be absent, his Deputy takes his place.\n\nThe Dewan Negara may initiate legislation, except for financial and fiscal matters – a regulation directly from the Westminster system. It may also amend legislation, provided it does not deal with financial matters. Any proposed legislation must first be passed by the Dewan Rakyat. Then it is presented to the Dewan Negara in three readings. At the first, the legislation's proposer presents it to the assembly. At the second, the bill is debated. At the third, a vote is taken whether to pass or reject the bill. The Dewan Negara may not formally reject bills; it is only allowed to delay their passage by one month, or up to a year under certain circumstances. After the bill has passed or the requisite period is up, the bill is presented to the King for royal assent. If the King demurs or 30 days pass without royal assent, the bill is sent back to Parliament with a list of suggested amendments. The bill must then be reapproved by both houses of Parliament. If the King still does not grant royal assent 30 days after it is presented to him again, the bill automatically becomes law. It does not take effect, however, until it is published in the Government Gazette.\n\nAlthough members of Parliament typically have legal immunity when it comes to freedom of discussion, a gag rule forbids discussion about certain articles of the Constitution such as the status of Bahasa Malaysia as the national language and Bumiputra privileges in Article 153.\n\nAs of 17 July 2018, the Dewan Negara has 51 senators, most of them are appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong in the previous parliamentary term. Although Pakatan Harapan (PH) becomes the governing party in the Dewan Rakyat, Barisan Nasional (BN), with 28 seats, remains the largest party in the Dewan Negara. PH is, however, expected to make senatorial appointments once the present Parliament officially opened. This is to fill in vacancies that occur in the Dewan Negara.\n"}
{"id": "2271363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271363", "title": "Chlamydia psittaci", "text": "Chlamydia psittaci\n\nChlamydia psittaci is a lethal intracellular bacterial species that may cause endemic avian chlamydiosis, epizootic outbreaks in mammals, and respiratory psittacosis in humans. Potential hosts include feral birds and domesticated poultry, as well as cattle, pigs, sheep, and horses. \"C. psittaci\" is transmitted by inhalation, contact, or ingestion among birds and to mammals. Psittacosis in birds and in humans often starts with flu-like symptoms and becomes a life-threatening pneumonia. Many strains remain quiescent in birds until activated by stress. Birds are excellent, highly mobile vectors for the distribution of chlamydia infection, because they feed on, and have access to, the detritus of infected animals of all sorts.\n\n\"C. psittaci\" in birds is often systemic, and infections can be inapparent, severe, acute, or chronic with intermittent shedding. \"C. psittaci\" strains in birds infect mucosal epithelial cells and macrophages of the respiratory tract. Septicaemia eventually develops and the bacteria become localized in epithelial cells and macrophages of most organs, conjunctiva, and gastrointestinal tracts. It can also be passed in the eggs. Stress will commonly trigger onset of severe symptoms, resulting in rapid deterioration and death. \"C. psittaci\" strains are similar in virulence, grow readily in cell culture, have 16S rRNA genes that differ by <0.8%, and belong to eight known serotypes. All should be considered to be readily transmissible to humans.\n\n\"C. psittaci\" serovar A is endemic among psittacine birds and has caused sporadic zoonotic disease in humans, other mammals, and tortoises. Serovar B is endemic among pigeons, has been isolated from turkeys, and has also been identified as the cause of abortion in herds of dairy cattle. Serovars C and D are occupational hazards for slaughterhouse workers and for people in contact with birds. Serovar E isolates (known as Cal-10, MP or MN) have been obtained from a variety of avian hosts worldwide and, although they were associated with the 1920s–1930s outbreak in humans, a specific reservoir for serovar E has not been identified. The M56 and WC serovars were isolated during outbreaks in mammals. Many \"C. psittaci\" strains are susceptible to bacteriophages.\n\n\"Chlamydia psittaci\" is a small bacterium (0.5μm) that undergoes several transformations during its lifecycle. It exists as an elementary body (EB) between hosts. The EB is not biologically active, but is resistant to environmental stresses and can survive outside a host. The EB travels from an infected bird to the lungs of an uninfected bird or person in small droplets, and is responsible for infection. Once in the lungs, the EB is taken up by cells in a pouch called an endosome by phagocytosis. However, the EB is not destroyed by fusion with lysosomes, as is typical for phagocytosed material. Instead, it transforms into a reticulate body and begins to replicate within the endosome. The reticulate bodies must use some of the host's cellular machinery to complete their replication. The reticulate bodies then convert back to elementary bodies, and are released back into the lung, often after causing the death of the host cell. The EBs are thereafter able to infect new cells, either in the same organism or in a new host. Thus, the lifecycle of \"C. psittaci\" is divided between the elementary body which is able to infect new hosts, but can not replicate, and the reticulate body, which replicates, but is not able to cause new infection.\n\nThe disease caused by \"C. psittaci\", psittacosis, was first characterized in 1879 when seven individuals in Switzerland were found to experience pneumonia after exposure to tropical pet birds. The causative pathogen was not known. The related bacterial species \"Chlamydia trachomatis\" was described in 1907, but was assumed to be a virus, as it could not be grown on artificial media. In the winter of 1929–1930, a psittacosis pandemic spread across the United States and Europe. Its mortality rate was 20% and as high as 80% for pregnant women. The disease's spread was eventually attributed to exposure to Amazon parrots imported from Argentina. Though \"C. psittaci\" was identified in 1930 as the agent responsible for psittacosis, it was not found to be a bacterium until examination by electron microscopy in the 1960s.\n\nFor several decades, the family Chlamydiaceae contained a sole genus, \"Chlamydia\". \"C. psittaci\" was originally classified from the 1960s to 1999 as a species of this sole genus. In 1999, the order Chlamydiales was assigned two new families (Parachlamydiaceae and Simkaniaceae), and within the family Chlamydiaceae, the genus \"Chlamydia\" was divided into two genera, \"Chlamydia\" and the newly designated genus \"Chlamydophila\", with \"C. psittaci\" becoming \"Chlamydophila psittaci\". However, this reclassification \"was not wholly accepted or adopted\" among microbiologists, which \"resulted in a reversion to the single, original genus \"Chlamydia\", which now encompasses all 9 species including \"C. psittaci\".\" A new species was added to the reunited genus \"Chlamydia\" in 2013, two more were added in 2014.\n\nWhat were once classified as the mammal-endemic strains \"C. psittaci\" abortion, \"'C. psittaci\" feline, and \"C. psittaci\" guinea pig are today three separate species, \"C. abortus\", \"C. felis\", and \"C. caviae\".\n\n\"C. psittaci\" infection is also associated with schizophrenia. Many other kinds of infections have been associated with schizophrenia.\n\nLike other Chlamydia, \"C. psittaci\" is an intracellular pathogen and has thus undergone significant genome reduction. Most \"C. psittaci\" genomes encode between 1,000 and 1,400 proteins. A total of 911 core genes were found to be present in all 20 strains sequenced by Read et al., corresponding to 90% of the genes present in each genome.\n\nIn addition to symptoms and CHX, complement fixation, microimmunofluorescence, and polymerase chain reaction tests can be used to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nTetracycline or macrolides can be used to treat this condition. The drugs are given intravenously or orally, depending on drug choice. Treatment should continue for 10–14 days after the fever subsides. In children or pregnant women, though, tetracycline should not be used. Ibuprofen or acetominophen, and fluids are also administered. Cigarette or tobacco smoke should be avoided. While taking tetracycline, dairy products should be avoided.\n\n"}

His father became the founder of the Aboriginal Advancement League and the first Aboriginal JP, dying in 1968, a year after a long campaign bore fruit – the success of the referendum giving the national government responsibility for Aboriginal affairs and including Aborigines in the determination of the country's population.\n\nLin Onus was educated in the 1950s and 1960s at Deepdene Primary School and Balwyn High School in Melbourne, Victoria. He was largely a self-taught urban artist who, after being expelled from Balwyn High School for fighting, became a mechanic and spray painter, before making artefacts for the tourist market with his father's business, Aboriginal Enterprise Novelties.\n\nOnus became a successful painter, sculptor and printmaker. His painting \"Barmah Forest\" won Canberra's national Aboriginal Heritage Award in 1994.\n\nThe works of Onus often involve symbolism from Aboriginal styles of painting, along with recontextualisation of contemporary artistic elements. The images in his works include haunting portrayals of the Barmah red gum forests of his father's ancestral country, and the use of \"rarrk\" cross-hatching-based painting style that he learned (and was given permission to use) when visiting the Indigenous communities of Maningrida in 1986.\n\nHis most famous work, \"Michael and I are just slipping down to the pub for a minute\", has been featured on a postcard, and is a reference to his colleague, artist Michael Eather. The painting is of a dingo riding on the back of a stingray which is meant to symbolise his mother's and father's cultures combining in reconciliation. The image of the wave is borrowed from \"The Great Wave of Kanagawa\" (1832), by Japanese printmaker, Katsushika Hokusai.\n\nIn 1993 Lin Onus received the award Member of the Order of Australia \"for service to the arts as a painter and sculptor and to the promotion of aboriginal artists and their work.\" Onus was inducted to the Victorian Aboriginal Honour Roll in 2012.\n\nLin Onus died at the age of 47 in Melbourne. He was buried at the settlement of Cummeragunja on the NSW-Victorian border.\n\nOn 8 December 2000, as part of Aboriginal Reconciliation, Peter Bond, Principal of Balwyn High School, at the school presentation night at Dallas Brooks Hall, issued a posthumous apology to Lin Onus for being expelled from Balwyn High School in the early 1960s.\n\n\n\n"}

She was a star of the Royal Dramatic Theatre and has been referred to as the first celebrity within Swedish drama and known as the Swedish Aspasia, both for her artistic ability but also for the literary salon she hosted. She is also known in history for her love affair with King Oscar I of Sweden.\n\nEmilie Högquist was the daughter of Anders Högquist, butler of count Carl De Geer, and Anna Beata Hedvall. She was the sister of the actor Jean Högquist and the actress Hanna Högquist.\n\nIn 1821, she was enrolled in the ballet school of the \"Dramatens elevskola\" by her mother. At the school she was a student of Karolina Bock. During her tenure as a student, she participated in the \"Selinderska Barntheatern\", a children's theatre managed by Anders Selinder.\n\nEmilie Högquist was early in life subject of prostitution. The profession of her father exposed her to the interest of male members of the upper classes, and her mother was known to host balls, to which she invited students from the acting school, including her daughter, and introduced them to rich men. Further more, the Royal Dramatic Theatre also hosted balls in which men could pay for the privilege to dance with a student of the \"Dramatens elevskola\". Both the balls given by her mother as well as the theater balls was regarded with some suspicion, because the situation in which rich men was introduced to poor female student artists was considered to give opportunity for prostitution. \nThis is known to have occurred in certain cases, and in the case of Emilie Högquist, it is known that she was prostituted by her mother, who introduced her to a rich, elder male patron in 1826, after having ended her term at the acting school at the age of fourteen.\n\nAugust Blanche once remarked of the mother of Emilie Högquist: \"God save every child from a mother like that!\"\n\nBetween 1826 and 1828, she toured Sweden as a member of the travelling theater company of Anders Petter Berggren. Upon her return to the capital in 1828, she was engaged at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm.\n\nEmilie Högquist made her debut at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in the play \"Qväkaren\" in 1828, and was given a contract in 1831.\n\nDuring her first years of her career, she was criticized for her weak and shrill voice and described as insecure in her movements onstage. In 1834, however, she made a trip to Paris, where she studied the contemporary French acting methods, after which she is said to have improved, learned how to act with more self assurance onstage, how to dress with more skill in accordance to her roles and acquired a better control of her voice. Upon her return, an important opportunity to demonstrate herself was given when the star actress Sara Torsslow, famed as the leading \"sentimental actress\" and comedienne of the Royal Dramatic Theatre, left after the actors strike of 1834, after which a replacement had to be found to fill the roles otherwise normally allotted to Torsslow, and after the star actress Charlotta Eriksson had been unable to perform them satisfyingly, as they were not of her genre, Emilie Högvist was given the chance, and with such success that she reportedly won over not only Torrslow's old admirers but also acquired a wide circle of admirers of her own, and she was from this year regarded as \"one of the most celebrated and often performing actresses\" of the Royal Dramatic Theatre.\n\nShe made a second study trip to Paris in the summer of 1837, during which she took lessons from Mademoiselle Mars, whom she admired as a role model, after which her inborn talent is said to have blossomed fully, and she was reportedly received with great enthusiasm by the audience upon her return to Stockholm for the 1837–38 season. Her salary can illustrate her rise in career: in 1835, Emilie Högquist had reached a wage of 1.200, while the minimum salary of an average actress was 200, and the prima donna of the Royal Swedish Opera, Henriette Widerberg was given a salary of 1.600.\n\nEmilie Högquist was foremost celebrated in the roles within the then fashionable genre of French salon comedies, often plays by Eugéne Scribe, and \"excelled within graceful coquetry and lovable spirituality\" - she is said to have succeeded best within comedy, where her \"soft personality and unconventional acting celebrated triumphs. She was not only respected as an artist, but her beauty also attracted great attention and Fritz von Dardel described her \"This actress, was perhaps even more famed for her beauty and her graces than for her talent. She was very tall and thin, with a skin of rose and lily, fine features and beautiful blond hair, and she was additionally good humored and pleasant.\" \nAmong her most acclaimed roles were \"Qväkaren och dansaren\" ('Quaker and the dancer) by Eugéne Scribe, \"Shakspears Kär\" ('Shakespeare's Love'), Jeanne d'Arc in \"Jungfrun av Orleans\" ('Maid of Lorraine') by Schiller, the title role of Mary Stuart (play) and Ophelia in \"Hamlet\". In the summer of 1839, she made a third study trip to Paris, and upon her return, she bought with her the comedy \"Richelieus första vapenbragd\" ('First combat of Richelieu') by Bayard and Dumanoir, which she translated to Swedish and in which she was praised for her breeches role of the young duke de Richelieu (1842). She is noted to have performed 125 roles on the theater during her career in 1828–45, and she also made tours in Finland.\n\nShe made her last performance on 7 December 1845. In the theatre, she was replaced by Zelma Hedin. She was one of the three famous Swedish artistes who were officially celebrated in a memorial of famous Swedish actors in 1847.\n\nIn 1831–33, Emilie Högquist had an affair with the British diplomat John Bloomfield, 2nd Baron Bloomfield, who installed her in an apartment and with whom she had a daughter, Tekla, in October 1833.\n\nIt was reportedly the king, Charles XIV John of Sweden, who financed Emilie Högquist's study trip to Paris in the summer of 1834, because his son Crown Prince Oscar had fallen in love with her and the king wished to have her removed. Upon her return to Stockholm, however, the Oscar and Emilie had become lovers, and in the autumn on 1836, Oscar paid for Emilie Högquist to be installed in a \"magnificent entrapment\" at the Gustaf Adolfstorg 18, and was known for its \"Asian luxury\". Reportedly, Crown Prince Oscar alternated in his nights between his \"first family\" in the Stockholm Palace, and his \"second family\" at Gustaf Adolfstorg 18 close by. Emilie and Oscar had two sons, Hjalmar and Max. Max was named for Maximilian de Beauharnais, Oscar's brother-in-law. The two boys were unofficially referred to as \"the Princes of Lapland\". Max grew up to become a merchant in China, where he died in 1872. Hjalmar died in 1874 in London.\n\nEmilie Högquist was an intellectual and hosted a literary salon every Thursday for the Swedish art world of painters and authors. It is noted, however, that most of the guests at her salons were men, as women where afraid to be associated with her privately because of her reputation as a courtesan: some exceptions were noted, such as Malla Höök and Elise Frösslind. She spent her summers at Framnäs on Djurgården. Though she died greatly indebted, the support of crown prince Oscar liberated her from any financial troubles and she was active within charity. She is noted to have acted as the patron of her brother Jean (Johan Isak) Högquist (1814–1850), who was a popular actor for a while, but did not manage his career because of his alcoholism: Emilie Högquist paid for his trip to the United States, but he returned on the year of her death, which is said to have affected him deeply, and died just three years later. \nShe is also noted to have supported the former operatic singer Henriette Widerberg, who lived in deep poverty after her career had been discontinued.\n\nFrom 1842 onward, Emilie Högquist suffered from the health problems of a progressing consumption, and spent the summer in Rome in Italy, where she was celebrated by the Swedish art colony. Her health recovered, and upon her return, she visited her daughter and sons in Hamburg and met Emil Key, who was ten years her junior and became her last lover.\n\nIn the summer of 1845 she made a health journey to Carlsbad, but her illness had progressed to a point where she was no longer able to recover sufficiently to manage her work, and her last season of 1845-46 was a failure: after her last performance in December 1845, she was bedridden until May 1846. In July 1846, she left Sweden in an attempt to seek a cure for her consumption in a number of health resorts in Germany and Switzerland before continuing to Italy; she finally died in Turin 18 December 1846.\n\nWith John Bloomfield, 2nd Baron Bloomfield:\n\n\nWith King Oscar I of Sweden:\n\n\nThe relationship between Emilie Högquist and Oscar I was portrayed in the film \"Emilie Högquist\" starring Signe Hasso and Georg Rydeberg (1939), one of the most expensive made in Sweden during the 1930s.\n\n\n"}

His father John Bartholomew Senior started a cartographical establishment in Edinburgh, Scotland and he was educated in the work. He was subsequently assistant to the German geographer August Petermann, until in 1856 he took up the management of his father's firm. For this establishment, now known as the Edinburgh Geographical Institute, Bartholomew built up a reputation unsurpassed in Great Britain for the production of the finest cartographical work.\n\nBartholomew was an in-house cartographer for George Philip. He is best known for the development of colour contouring (or hypsometric tints), the system of representing altitudes on a graduated colour scale, with areas of high altitude in shades of brown and areas of low altitude in shades of green. He first showcased his colour contouring system at the Paris Exhibition of 1878; although it initially met with skepticism, it went on to become standard cartographical practice.\n\nAmong his numerous publications, particularly worthy of note is the series of maps of Great Britain reduced from the Ordnance Survey to scales of ½ inch and ¾ inch to 1 mile, with relief shown by contour lines and hypsometric tints. The ½ inch series is among the finest of its kind ever produced.\n\nUpon his retirement in 1888, John Bartholomew was succeeded in the firm by his son John George, who extended the ½ inch series, and applied its principles to many other works. For the last six years of his life Bartholomew was living at 32 Royal Terrace in Edinburgh.\n\nBartholomew died in London on 29 March 1893. He is buried with his mother and father in Grange Cemetery in Edinburgh, in the northwest section. His wife Annie MCGregor (1836–1872), whom he greatly outlived, is also buried there.\n\n\n"}
