It affected the Chinese, Indian, Japanese, and Korean immigrant farmers in California. Implicitly, the law was primarily directed at the Japanese. It passed 35–2 in the State Senate and 72–3 in the State Assembly and was co-written by attorney Francis J. Heney and California state attorney general Ulysses S. Webb at the behest of Governor Hiram Johnson. Japan's Consul General Kametaro Iijima and lawyer Juichi Soyeda lobbied against the law. In a letter to the United States Secretary of State, the Japanese government via the Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs called the law \"essentially unfair and inconsistent... with the sentiments of amity and good neighborhood which have presided over the relations between the two countries,\" and noted that Japan felt it was \"in disregard of the spirit of the existing treaty between Japan and the United States.\" The law was meant to discourage immigration from Asia, and to create an inhospitable climate for immigrants already living in California.\n\nLeading up to the passage of the 1913 Alien Land Law, there had been growing anti-Asian prejudice in California and in the United States in general, first against the Chinese during the 19th century, culminating with the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and then against the Japanese during the 20th century. Anti-Japanese sentiment was often expressed in racist Yellow Peril arguments.\n\nIn 1900, there was an influx of over 12,000 Japanese immigrants to the US mainland, many of whom had just released from indentured labor with Hawaii's 1898 annexation. Many Japanese immigrants settled in California and relocated to rural areas after they initially landed in cities. Farming became the major economic foundation for the Japanese population in California, and they saw it as a way to prove their productive abilities and to establish a sense of permanency in their new nation. Gradually, many moved from farm labor into truck farming and filled the niche market for perishable crops.\n\nThe sudden increases in Japanese immigration in that and subsequent years spurred many anti-Japanese political and organizational movements in California, and the introduction of anti-Asian legislation to the California legislature, all of which influenced public sentiment. Many workers returning from World War I felt that the Japanese were infringing on their job opportunities. In addition, some feared that the Japanese were attempting to overtake white control of California’s farmland. The Los Angeles Times and groups such as the Anti-Asiatic Association were vocal instigators of the anti-Japanese movement. In 1908, the United States and Japan agreed to limit Japanese migration to the United States, with Japan agreeing that it would stop issuing passports to persons intending to migrate as laborers who had no established future residence in the United States or had no family members already in the United States.\n\nThe Japanese possessed the right to lease and own land in the United States for residential and commercial use based on the 1911 American treaty with Japan. In 1910, most Japanese were working in the agricultural and fishing industries. Rights to agricultural land, unprotected by treaty, thus became the focus for the Alien Land Laws, as state-level deterrents to immigration were sought in a dearth of federal-level involvement.\n\nThe Japanese presence in California as agricultural laborers and tenant farmers rapidly grew during the first two decades of the 20th century. They filled a labor void in farming previously occupied by the Chinese, whose numbers had sharply declined with the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act. Especially through tenant farming, Japanese families hoped to save enough money to eventually purchase their own land. Though it was meant to decrease immigration, the 1913 law likely had relatively little actual impact on Japanese farmers, and in fact, after the passage of the 1913 law, their numbers rose. Many Japanese immigrants, or issei, circumvented that law by transferring the title of their land to their American-born children, or nisei, who were US citizens. By 1915, three quarters of the vegetables consumed by Los Angeles residents were grown by Japanese.\n\nThe California Alien Land Law of 1920 continued the 1913 law while filling many of its loopholes. Among the loopholes filled were that the leasing of land for a period of three years or less was no longer allowed; owning of stock in companies that acquired agricultural land was forbidden; and guardians or agents of ineligible aliens were required to submit an annual report on their activities. The 1920 Alien Land Law was passed in reaction to the intensification of anti-Japanese sentiment, and to the fact that the 1913 Alien Land Law was doing little to stem Japanese immigration to California. The law was approved by the voters after being proposed by the California State Legislature. It passed with a vote of 668,438 to 222,086. The 1920 law was amended in 1923 to further fill wording-related loopholes.\n\nThere is not complete agreement about the effects of the 1920 law. It is thought by some to have had a significant negative impact on Japanese involvement in agriculture. For example, the amount of agricultural land controlled by Japanese decreased by approximately 40 percent between 1920 and 1930, and total acres farmed by Japanese persons declined by 47 percent. During the 1920s, there was a general decline in the agricultural economy in California and elsewhere in the United States, which would have partially contributed to the sudden downturn in Japanese farming. Many Japanese were also able to evade the law, often by claiming to be farm “managers.” There were at least sixteen prosecutions of Japanese for violations of the Alien Land Law from 1920 to 1940, but there were likely many more. Although the Alien Land Laws made farming more difficult for them, the Japanese still managed to maintain a fairly high level of economic success in the agricultural industry. In 1915, Japanese Foreign Minister Komei Kato likely spoke for many Japanese when he expressed the sentiment that Japanese immigrants were dismayed by being singled out in such a fashion by the Alien Land Law legislation.\n\nIn 1923, the laws were upheld in the United States Supreme Court and were determined not to be in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nThe 1946 Supreme Court of California case \"People v. Oyama\" reaffirmed the 1923 decision, determining that Japanese immigrant Kajiro Oyama had attempted to evade the Alien Land Laws by purchasing farmland that he placed in the name of his son, who was a U.S. citizen. In fact, Oyama’s petition to be named as his son’s guardian in order to have authority over the land had been approved by a local court. This method was a major way in which the Japanese were able to acquire agricultural land during this period, since most other options were closed to them. The case was then reviewed by the United States Supreme Court in \"Oyama v. California\" after petitioning by the Oyamas and their supporters. The majority opinion held that Fred Oyama’s rights as a U.S. citizen to take and hold property had been violated by the state of California. The decision was arguably instrumental in helping to bring about a shift in attitudes toward the Japanese and their property rights.\n\nThe Alien Land Laws were invalidated in 1952 by the Supreme Court of California as a violation of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution in \"Sei Fujii v. California\". Fujii was a longtime Los Angeles resident, but was not a U.S. citizen. He alleged that the law violated the California and United States Constitutions, and that it also went against the spirit of the United Nations Charter to which the United States was bound by treaty. The California District Court of Appeal had decided in 1950 that the Alien Land Law was in violation of Articles 55 and 56 of the United Nations Charter. The Supreme Court of California then ordered the case transferred for hearing and settlement, as it was determined to be a sufficiently important question of law.\n\nThe laws are widely held to have been discriminatory measures specifically targeting the Japanese, spurred by fears about the increasing number of Japanese immigrants settling in California. The choice to apply the laws only to those aliens ineligible for citizenship rather than to all aliens meant that European aliens would not be affected. Because of this, the bill was decidedly directed at Asians and specifically at the Japanese, who had become a strong presence in the agricultural labor market as well as in the control of farms. The Alien Land Laws were part of a larger trend of attempted discrimination against the Japanese through policy in California during the early 20th century.\n\nEight other American states passed restrictive land-ownership laws during the years 1913–25. These states were Arizona, Washington, Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Idaho, Montana, and Oregon. Arkansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, Utah, and Wyoming followed with the passage of Alien Land Laws during the World War II years.\n\nFlorida is the only state that has not repealed its Alien Land Law. The 1926 amendment is buried in a proviso to the 'Basic Rights' paragraph of the Florida Constitution (Article 1, Section 2):\n\n\n\n\nyo"}

In recent years, he has been battling drug addiction causing the break up of his 2014 reunion with Days Of The New shortly after it began for the second time. Since then, he has been arrested several times for possession of narcotics and paraphernalia, served jail time. As of 2018 it has been reported that Meeks still writes songs and struggles with substance abuse.\n\nMeeks was born on April 27, 1979 in Charlestown, Indiana. His parents divorced when he was 2, and he lived with his grandmother and father. His father was a musician. At a young age, he began playing guitar and wrote songs and performed covers by age 8. Between ages 11 to 15, he went to various rehabilitation centers and a year in special schooling. During that time, he formed an experimental rock band called Bad Dreemz which included Jesse Vest and Matt Taul. They then formed Dead Reckoning, which was a heavy metal band that sounded similar to Pantera. In 1995, Meeks moved to Louisville, and Dead Reckoning changed its name to Days of the New as well as its genre to an acoustic rock, post-grunge style. Regarding that era, Meeks stated, \"I went through paranoia and acid trips, separation from the mind and body... That's where my spiritual journey begins.\" Meeks' father, Gary Lee Meeks, passed away November 15, 2013 at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Indianapolis, IN at the age of 57.\n\nAt the age of 17, Meeks and fellow teenage band members Matt Taul, Todd Whitener and Jesse Vest were signed to a major record label. In 1997, they released their widely successful self-titled \"Yellow\" album that included the single, \"Touch, Peel and Stand.\" The song rose to #1 on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and became the group's signature piece. Opening slots on tour with Jerry Cantrell and Metallica further exposed the band to fans around the country. Days of the New then set out on a headlining tour that lasted until a stop in Dallas, Texas when Meeks' father finally drove him home and canceled the remainder of the tour's shows.\n\nSince the Release of Days of the New (2001 album) Meeks has continued writing music and uploading it on websites such as MySpace with continued usage of the Days Of The New name. Notable fan favourite demos are to name a few; Story of a Friend, Where It Ends and Superhero (Latter two from the delayed Purple Album) Among many more.\n\nMeeks has standing invitations to perform at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, as well as to front the Boston Pops. He has referred to himself as a maestro due to his self-taught mastery of the acoustic guitar and incorporation of classical sounds into his music.\n\nIn April 2005, Meeks was showcased in an episode of A&E's hit TV series \"Intervention\", which was filmed in February that year. Meeks' addiction to methamphetamine was one of the two subjects for this episode. He decided to go to rehab at Cirque Lodge in Provo, Utah, but the episode ends with Meeks checking out early after 73 days. After a period of relapsing, he remained sober since September 19, 2005 until a brief relapse in September 2007. According to a follow-up interview with \"Intervention\", Meeks has since remained sober.\n\nIn an online interview with Meeks, licensed clinical counselor and blogger Stephen Borgman described Meeks' Asperger syndrome and included many descriptions by Meeks himself. In this way, Meeks stated that he had \"lived with intense shame and the feeling of extreme inadequacy. Everything I felt I did was wrong and that I could do nothing right. I wasn't diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome until 2005. […] Thanks to my father Gary Meeks, he knew I was different and tried to protect me from the vultures of punishment. I felt severely punished anyway by the way I felt when I was removed from my comfort zones such as putting me in school.\"\n\nOn April 25, 2008, an interview with Meeks was featured on the podcast series, Uncensored Net Noise.\n\nMeeks has two daughters from previous relationships. His first daughter, Suvanna Dawn Meeks, (who was later put up for adoption) was born in 1994 from his relationship with his then girlfriend Amy. His second daughter, Emma Rambat, was born November 11, 2004 with his then girlfriend Karen. \nIn 2014, Travis was arrested in Portland, Maine for failing to appear in court after being charged with possession of a hypodermic needle. \n\nIn 2017 he was arrested for charges of burglary, fleeing or evading police on foot, public intoxication charges, and possession of a controlled substance. In 2020 he was arrested for disorderly conduct, failure to obey a police officer, and resisting arrest.\n\nMeeks plays Taylor guitars for their rich sound but has also used Tacomas.

It stars Charles Bronson as Chaney, a drifter freighthopping through Louisiana during the Great Depression, who competes in illegal bare-knuckled boxing matches after forming a partnership with the garrulous hustler Speed, played by James Coburn.\n\nIn 1933 a man dressed in simple clothes with a hobo appearance carrying a handbag jumps down from the boxcar of a slow-moving train on the outskirts of an anonymous town somewhere in Louisiana. He soon comes upon a bare-knuckled street fight run by gamblers, which he intently observes. After the bout, the man approaches the fast-talking \"Speed\", the backer of the losing fighter. Introducing himself as Chaney (Charles Bronson), he asks Speed to set up a fight for him, which Speed does. Before the fight, his opponent, the winner of the contest he previously witnessed, looks Chaney up and down and asks disparagingly if he isn't a little too old to be there. Betting all of the six dollars he possesses on himself, Chaney responds by dispatching the younger man with a single punch.\n\nSuitably impressed, Speed offers to become Chaney's manager, but Chaney cautions Speed that he needs only enough money to \"fill a few in-betweens\" before moving on. They travel to New Orleans where Speed plans to match Chaney against local fighters at long odds. Chaney finds lodgings in a rundown rooming house. At a diner, he meets Lucy Simpson (Jill Ireland), a lonely woman whose husband is in prison. They begin an uneasy affair.\n\nSpeed recruits the genteel but slightly decrepit cutman, Poe (Strother Martin), \"a dyed in the wool hophead\" whose spell at medical school many years before was cut short, Poe confesses, due to his fondness for opium. Chaney nonetheless accedes to Speed's request and accepts Poe's services at the going rate.\n\nSpeed arranges another fight, this time in bayou country. Chaney, Speed and Poe are accompanied on the trip by Speed's lady friend, Gayleen (Margaret Blye). Chaney easily disposes of the Cajun hitter, but the hitter's sponsor, Pettibon (Edward Walsh), refuses to pay up on the grounds that Chaney is a ringer. Chaney seems to accept matters and persuades the indignant Speed to leave. However, later that evening Chaney and his retinue appear unannounced at Pettibon's backwoods honky-tonk. Overcoming Pettibon's confederates with his fists, Cheney seizes a pistol, forces Pettibon to turn over the unpaid cash, and proceeds to shoot up Pettibon's joint until all the bullets are discharged. The troupe drives back to New Orleans in high spirits.\n\nSpeed next arranges for Chaney to take on the city's undefeated bare-knuckle fighter Jim Henry (Robert Tessier), an intimidating brawler with a bald pate and bull neck, who is bankrolled by wealthy businessman Chick Gandil (Michael McGuire). Gandil insists that Speed put up $3,000 instead of the stake of $1000 that Speed had anticipated. To cover the shortfall, Speed obtains a loan from a gang of local mobsters headed by Doty (Bruce Glover). Chaney fights Jim Henry, who resides stubbornly but finally succumbs, beaten to the ground under a flurry of blows from Chaney.\n\nThe trio of Chaney, Speed and Poe celebrate at a juke joint with their lady friends. Speed gets into a game of dice and gambles away his share of the winnings. The mobsters stalk Speed because of the money he owes.\n\nGandil attempts to get Chaney to switch sides and fight for him. Speed is willing because it will square his debts, but Chaney refuses to go along, and they argue bitterly. As well, Lucy ends her affair with Chaney, dissatisfied with his emotional distance and lack of commitment.\n\nMeanwhile, Gandil brings in a top fighter from Chicago, the aptly named Street (Nick Dimitri), a sleek and silent gent who arrives at the train station expensively clad in a black hat and black leather blazer, and whose baggage the demoted Jim Henry is now required to carry. Unable to draw Chaney into a winner-take-all bout, Gandil pays off Speed's debt and takes him hostage. If there is no fight, threatens Gandil, Speed will be killed.\n\nPoe visits Chaney at the rooming house to tell him about Speed's predicament. Chaney comes to Gandil's warehouse where the fight will take place. Not only is he forced to fight for Speed's life, but he must risk all of his own winnings.\n\nStreet proves a formidable opponent. The two take turns knocking each other down. Eventually Chaney wins the grueling bout, but not before Street, on his hands and knees, refuses Gandil's demand that he use extraordinary means (a pair of brass cylinders) to avert defeat, sweeping them aside when they are placed on the ground in front of him. Instead, Street gamely staggers to his feet and goes down swinging. Speed's life is spared. True to his word, Chaney decides the time has come to move on. He gives Speed and Poe a generous cut of the winnings and walks alone towards the railroad tracks. As Chaney disappears into the darkness, Speed declares, \"He sure was something.\"\n\n\nIn the early 1970s Walter Hill had developed a strong reputation as a screenwriter, particularly of action films such as \"The Getaway\". He was approached by Larry Gordon when the latter was head of production at AIP, who offered Hill the chance to direct one of his scripts. (AIP had recently done this with John Milius on \"Dillinger\" (1973)). Gordon subsequently moved over to Columbia, where he established a unit making low budget action films, and got funding for Hill's project; it was to be the first from Gordon's unit.\n\nHill wrote and directed for scale even though \"the truth is, I would have paid them for the chance.\"\n\nThe project began as an original screenplay by Bryan Gindoff and Bruce Henstell called \"The Streetfighter\".\n\nHill thought the project could become more \"up market\" if he made it more like a Western and set it in the past; Gordon was from New Orleans and suggested setting it in that city. Hill says the script incorporated elements of an earlier Western he had written, \"Lloyd Williams and his Brother\". He wrote it in a style inspired by Alexander Jacobs - \"extremely spare, almost Haiku style. Both stage directions and dialogue.\"\n\nHill wrote one draft, then rewrote it \"five or six times before I finally got it. But I did get it and I knew it. I knew it was going to get an actor and get made.\"\n\nHill says he originally wrote the film intending to cast a younger actor, like Jan Michael Vincent, and that he wanted Warren Oates to play Coburn's role.\n\nAccording to Hill, \"they had offered it to a couple of actors and they didn't want to do it.\" Then it was sent to Charles Bronson even though Hill thought he was \"too old\". A day later, Bronson's agent called back and said Bronson had read the script and wanted to do the film \"but he had to meet me. He wanted to see if I measured up.\"\n\nHill remembers that Bronson \"was in remarkable physical condition for a guy his age; I think he was about 52 at the time. He had excellent coordination, and a splendid build. His one problem was that he was a smoker, so he didn't have a lot of stamina. I mean, he probably could have kicked anybody's ass on that movie, but he couldn't fight much longer than 30 or 40 seconds.\" Hill later said Bronson received \"very close to a million\" dollars for his role.\n\nThe film was shot on location in Louisiana. Hill says his cinematographer Philip Lathrop was incredibly useful during the shoot:\n\nBefore we started I was in my office later at night and Lathrop came by, noted I wasn't in a good mood. \"Anything wrong?\" I had never done it, worried if I will make it look alright. He immediately said \"Don't worry about that. We will make a film, make the shots. If you are having a problem we will make the shots. I can already tell you you are ahead of other directors.\" He said \"Anything we shoot we will cut together.\" He said \"The problem that you're going to have is making everybody getting along and you getting what you want.\" And he was of course 100 percent right. That is the problem with direction. Beyond my first or second film, I don't think I've ever had terrible dilemmas based upon resources, but shooting and figuring out how is not a problem, never was. The problems that you have are getting everybody to be on the same page.\n\nHill says that Bronson was more supportive to work with than Coburn:\n\n[Bronson was a] very angry guy ... Didn't get along with a lot of people. The only reason I can tell you he and I got along well was he respected that I wrote the script. He liked the script. Also I didn't try to get close to him. Kept it very business-like. I think he liked that. Jimmy Coburn who everybody liked and got along well with, he and I did not get along well. I think he was not in a good mood about being in a movie with Charlie, it was second banana. He had been up there more, and his career was coming back a bit. I don't think he was wild about being second banana. But Charlie was a big star, perceived to be low rent. That was part of his anger ... He thought there was a cosmic injustice when he was not a movie star at 35. He didn't get there till 45 or whatever ... [However] When things had seemed to not be working well, or there was some impasse, Charlie would come down hard on my side. That was tipping point.\n\nHill had troubles with Strother Martin. \"When he was good he was very good, but he could be just awful,\" Hill later said. \"I said to him once, 'Divide it in half, Strother,' and he said 'In half,' and I answered, 'That's if you want it to be in the movie.'\"\n\nHill said he used few tracking shots and zoom shots because \"I like to work within frame and composition, but when you move your camera you can lose composition because it is altering shape.\" He also decided to use background music quiet and subdued \"to get a sense of restraint in the movie ... people fighting is an ugly thing and I didn't want to encourage people to go out and fight. The concept of movie was hopefully legendary and somewhat heroic so that one couldn't really take a realistic approach.\"\n\nHill said the fights were \"dances. That is why there was no blood. People commented, \"the fights are great but they would have been better if you had put some blood in them.\" What they don't realize is as soon as you put blood in those fights they would then have gotten so real that they would have lost their dramatic truth.\"\n\nOriginal cut of the movie was around two hours long. When it was cut down to around 90 minutes several fights scenes were deleted. Some stills however show some of the deleted fights.\n\nHill described the music as \"kind of western; kind of simple and country. Nicely understated. \"\n\nThe film was profitable and in 2009, Hill said he was still receiving money from it.\n\n\"It was the best deal I ever made,\" he recalled. \"Got a career out of it. Picture was well received on the whole, made money. Got me off and going.\"\n\nHowever he never made another film with Bronson. \"We had kind of a falling out over the film,\" the director said. \"He thought I'd been a little too ... how do I put this? Too draconian in my editing of his wife's (Jill Ireland's) scenes.\"\n\nThe movie established a template to which Hill often returned.\n\nMy heroes usually have a very talkative foil opposite them or reluctantly alongside them, such as Bruce Dern in \"The Driver\", or Eddie Murphy in \"48 Hrs\", or James Coburn in \"Hard Times\". I like the kind of dialogue between people who have a mutual goal but very disparate appetites and needs, so that there's always a kind of friction that runs throughout the film. They don't like each other very much, and hopefully the movie supplies a reason for them to achieve a grudging kind of respect for each other.\n\nThe film has a 92% fresh rating on the film review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes based on 12 critic's reviews.\n\nPauline Kael called the setting of \"Hard Times\" \"elaborate period recreations that seem almost to be there for their own sake.\" The film is about the personalities of street fighters and their agents, people on the margins of society. On the other hand, setting the film in the Depression might have been a way for Hill to make Chaney a more sympathetic character. Kael explains, \"Put [Charles Bronson] in modern clothes and he's a hard-bitten tough guy, but with that cap on he's one of the dispossessed — an honest man who's known hunger\".\n\nRoger Ebert in his October 14, 1975, review of \"Hard Times\" in the Chicago Sun-Times called it \"a powerful, brutal film containing a definitive Charles Bronson performance.\"\n\n\n"}

He remains one of their most notable players. He stands in fifth place in River Plate's all time goalscoring records with 149 goals and 7th place in their all time appearances record with 374 matches played. A former Copa Libertadores, Intercontinental Cup and FIFA World Cup champion, Alonso was regularly regarded as one of the best south american players in the world during the 1970s.\n\nAlonso was born in Vicente López, Buenos Aires province, but grew up in the poor suburb of \"Los Polvorines\". An attacking midfielder, he rose through the ranks of River's youth divisions as the team was undergoing its infamous dry spell (18 years, 1957 to 1975, without a championship title). When Angel Labruna took the reins in 1975, Alonso was the team's anchor and holder of the No. 10 jersey.\n\nWith reinforcements Roberto Perfumo and Ubaldo Fillol, and the maturing of players like Daniel Passarella, Carlos Morete, J. J. López and Reinaldo Merlo, Alonso led the squad that won both the Metropolitano and the Nacional tournaments of 1975, ushering in a series of seven local titles in the period 1975-1981.\n\nIn 1976, Alonso was transferred to Olympique Marseille, but he was unsuccessful. River Plate arranged for his return in 1977.\n\nBetween the years 1979–1981, River won four local titles, and became one of the most expensive teams in the world, with a first team (Alonso-Luque) playing in league games and an equally prestigious second team (Carrasco-Ramón Díaz) used mostly in Copa Libertadores matches.\n\nDuring the 1981 \"Nacional\" tournament (which River would eventually win), Alonso often clashed with then coach Alfredo Di Stéfano (who seldom selected him for the first team and instead put younger players such as Carlos Daniel Tapia and José María Vieta in his position). After the \"Nacional\", Alonso was put on the transfer list and was sold to Vélez Sársfield on 1982. After playing alongside veteran Carlos Bianchi, he returned to River Plate once again for the 1984 season.\n\nMany talented midfielders emerged from River Plate's youth system during Alonso's reign, including Alejandro Sabella, Néstor Gorosito and Pedro Troglio.\n\nAlonso was a key player of the successful team of 1985–86 that won River Plate's first Copa Libertadores and Intercontinental Cup. In 1985, his main partner was Enzo Francescoli. By the time he retired, he had scored 166 goals in 464 matches.\n\nAlthough he was included in the Argentine squad, Alonso was not in the plans of coach César Luis Menotti for the 1978 FIFA World Cup. Menotti gave Alonso only a few minutes of play during the tournament, as Argentina went on to win the competition on home soil.\n\nIn 1983, national coach Carlos Bilardo gave Alonso some playing time, but eventually used younger players Diego Maradona, Jorge Burruchaga, and Carlos Tapia in his position.\n\nAfter retiring from the pitch, Alonso opened an insurance agency. He was also a partner in several commercial ventures, even though he was not an advertising figurehead: his appeal for non-River fans was limited, and Maradona was Argentina's poster boy after his exploits in the 1986 World Cup.\n\nTogether with Merlo, Alonso coached River Plate in 1989, but the duo was dismissed mid-season when new club president Alfredo Davicce made good on an election promise to bring in Daniel Passarella as coach. River eventually went on to win the championship.\n\nFor the 1978 World Cup, Argentina numbered players alphabetically, and as a result Alonso (a midfielder) wore the number 1 jersey (usually reserved for goalkeepers).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The architect was José Martin de Aldehuela, who died in Málaga in 1802. The chief builder was Juan Antonio Díaz Machuca.\n\nThe construction of the newest bridge (the one that stands today) was started in 1759 and took 34 years. There is a chamber above the central arch that was used for a variety of purposes, including as a prison. During the 1936-1939 civil war both sides allegedly used the prison as a torture chamber for captured opponents, killing some by throwing them from the windows to the rocks at the bottom of the El Tajo gorge. The chamber is entered through a square building that was once the guard-house. It now contains an exhibition describing the bridge's history and construction.\n\nConstruction of the previous bridge started in 1735; this was the first attempt to span the gorge at this height. The architects Jose Garcia and Juan Camacho completed the bridge with a single arch design.

{"id": "2177806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2177806", "title": "Silvermane", "text": "Silvermane\n\nSilvermane is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is a supervillain and a prominent figure in the Maggia, a fictional organized crime syndicate that is analogous to the Mafia and has been a long-time nemesis of Spider-Man. Silvermane is also the father of Joseph Manfredi.\n\nHe first appeared in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #73 and was created by Stan Lee and John Buscema.\n\nThe character's original storyline was about a mysterious stone tablet coveted by several \"Spider-Man\" villains. The \"Tablet Saga\" proved popular, although artist John Romita, Sr. said that it was not originally intended as an arc: \"We never even thought up Silvermane until the seventh issue [of the story arc], let alone a 'socko' ending.\"\n\nSilvio Manfredi, nicknamed \"Silvermane\" for his near-white hair, is a professional criminal originally from Corleone, Sicily that started his criminal career as a racketeer in the Maggia organized crime group, eventually becoming a criminal organizer and mastermind.\n\nIn his first appearance, he forced Dr. Curt Connors into making a mystical youth potion from an ancient clay tablet. He first crossed paths with the Lizard and Spider-Man during this scheme. Drinking the serum made Silvermane younger, but its effect unintentionally led to him becoming a child and then reached the point before the age of birth and disappearing completely. Silvermane eventually reappeared, revealing that he had mystically aged to his forties. He climbed through the ranks and became the crime family's head; he eventually formed an alliance with Hydra, a worldwide organization determined to take over the world and became their Supreme Hydra. He was defeated by Daredevil, Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D.. Silvermane reappeared in New York in an attempt to unite all of New York's gangs under his leadership and take over the criminal underworld, but his plans were complicated by the return of the Green Goblin (Bart Hamilton). The Goblin opposed him, and during a confrontation between the Goblin, Silvermane and Spider-Man, Silvermane fell from a great height but survived.\n\nSilvermane has hired many criminals, such as Hammerhead, and he has also been known to be a rival of the Kingpin. Silvermane once attempted to assassinate an amnesiac Kingpin. His former partner Dominic Tyrone assumed the identity of the Rapier and sought vengeance against Silvermane's betrayal by attempting to slay him. A flashback one-shot focused heavily on Silvermane's lifetime of corruption. The framework was the reporter Ben Urich investigating the Mafia. He found Silvermane was a legendary Mafia figure for decades; mothers would even warn their children to behave or 'One-Eye' would get them.\n\nIn his old age, Silvermane's injuries resulted in undoing the effects of the rejuvenation serum. Though bedridden, he continued to run his criminal empire until Dagger nearly killed him. Silvermane attempted to prolong his life by transforming himself into a cyborg. Kingpin gained control of his cyborg body until Dagger restored his life energy to him. His cyborg body was badly damaged by the first Jack O'Lantern during a gang war between Hammerhead and the Kingpin. Silvermane used a remote-controlled android doppelganger to battle Spider-Man. This was part of an attempt to boost the power of his remaining organic parts by harvesting parts from the superhuman body of Spider-Man. He attempted to drain his nemesis's radioactive blood to mobilize a new stronger cyborg body. Silvermane confronted Deathlok and the Punisher while setting up a major drug operation outside a grammar school. He is still an active member of the Maggia.\n\nSilvermane attempted to take part in a meetup of various criminal warlords, during a time when Wilson Fisk had fallen from power. The meeting's goal was to divide up Fisk's resources, but it did not go well. Silvermane was caught in the crossfire between the Secret Empire's forces and the Punisher. This was purely by coincidence as he was simply staying at the same motel as Punisher was. Silvermane used the resources of his semi and the cyborg bodies stored within to battle his way through the attackers and leave.\n\nIt was revealed some time later that Silvermane was killed during a shootout against Owl's gang at a New York City scrap yard. He was picked up by a magnet and dropped into a garbage compactor, crushing him to death and leaving the already troubled Maggia crime syndicate without a leader. Months later, he apparently returns along with various other deceased members during the Maggia's losing battle with the forces of Mister Negative. However this is later revealed to be a ruse by Maggia member Carmine, and that \"Silvermane\" was actually a robot controlled by a hired Mysterio in order to secretly give Carmine more influence in the syndicate's decision-making. The tables are turned on Carmine when Mysterio uses the robot to murder him, seemingly as a plot to take over the Maggia himself.\n\nSilvermane's head was still alive as it was found by a young boy when he traveled into the scrap yard. His head was in the possession of the boy who is currently building a robot, but then is stolen by Shocker. The head is used as leverage by The Superior Foes of Spider-Man to head the Maggia family, but the team double-crosses each other. Shocker defends the mob boss from the Punisher, so Silvermane nominates him as don of the Maggia family.\n\nSilvermane was once a normal human being with no superhuman abilities. He was a superb hand-to-hand combatant, an excellent marksman, and a brilliant strategist and organizer. He is typically armed with various handguns and a Thompson .45 caliber machine gun. Later, Silvermane's brain, vital organs, and head were transplanted into a cyborg body, increasing his physical abilities and giving him superhuman strength and senses. However, Silvermane's organic body parts are those of a frail 80-year-old man, and hence quite vulnerable.\n\nThe Ultimate Marvel version of Silvermane had a brief cameo in \"Ultimate Spider-Man\". With Wilson Fisk lying low due to legal problems, Silvermane decided to work with Hammerhead to remove the Kingpin from power. He told Hammerhead that all was needed was a little 'up here' (referring to his intelligence). Hammerhead, however, wanted it all, breaking Silvermane's neck while saying \"I think I got enough up here already.\" Silvermane was also mentioned as a leader of a mob which included Hammerhead in \"Ultimate X-Men\". It is stated that he owes a debt to Nathaniel Essex.\n\nAlso, the Ultimate incarnation's real name is shown in the Daily Bugle as Allan Silvermane, though he's referred to as Silvio Manfredi.\n\nSilvermane appeared in the \"House of M\" reality as a younger crime boss on the many families captured by the NYPD's Brotherhood unit.\n\n\n\nSilvermane appears in the novel \"Spider-man: Forever Young\" written by Stefan Petrucha. The details of the tablet story are retold, with some elements, such as the Shocker, removed, while others are updated or changed, such as Silvermane officially disdaining personal electronic devices due to their lack of security but really due to him being unable to read them and the Kingpin being left in a coma after the shock of learning the Schemer's true identity. The novel includes an original story set two years after the original storyline, with Silvermane now randomly aging from childhood to adulthood as he attempts to force Connors and Spider-Man to retrieve the tablet and find a cure for his condition. Even after Connors' research asserts that the tablet essentially cycles someone through their reincarnations in one lifetime to try and achieve true karma, Silvermane refuses to accept this, even attempting to blackmail Spider-Man for aid after deducing his true identity. While Vanessa Fisk also seeks the tablet to help her husband, witnessing what Silvermane has become convinces her to find another way, as a confrontation between Vanessa, Silvermane and Spider-Man in an old church Silvermane has taken as his base ends when Silvermane burns the church down trying to kill Spider-Man.\n\n"}

The group recorded a number of hit singles on the \"Billboard\" dance and pop charts in the late 1980s and early 1990s, most notably \"Baby, I Love Your Way/Freebird Medley\", a medley of 1970s hits by Peter Frampton and Lynyrd Skynyrd that reached the top of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart in December 1988. \n\nThe group has also two number one singles on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play, \"Say It's Gonna Rain\" and \"Fading Away\", and continues to create music into the 21st century- and are currently performing live (Bob Rosenberg and Elin Michaels).\n\nBob Rosenberg was born on January 18, 1959, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His mother, Gloria Mann, was a pop singer who had two Top 40 pop hits in the mid-1950s on the Sound Records label, \"Earth Angel (Will You Be Mine)\" and \"Teen Age Prayer\". After attending school in Florida, Rosenberg became a DJ at various local events, and by 1985 he was working at a Miami CHR radio station, WHQT (Hot 105). He remixed and edited songs as a radio-mix DJ for the station, and these mixes became popular in the Miami area. Rosenberg created a rap record in 1985 that was titled \"Miami Vice\", based on the popular TV show and its theme song, but MCA Records claimed that Rosenberg had infringed on their copyright. He also remixed and edited the song \"Beat Box\" for 2 Live Crew's 1986 debut album, \"The 2 Live Crew Is What We Are\".\n\nDuring 1986 and 1987, Rosenberg worked with various other musicians to create original music. He chose the name Will to Power for the group as an homage to German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche's theory of an individual's fundamental Will to Power.\n\n1986 to 1988: Rosenberg wrote \"Dreamin'\" as a tribute to his sister, Robin, after she had died. Radio program director Bill Tanner was the first PD to play \"Dreamin\" on Power 96 in Miami, Florida. Released in Miami on the Thrust Records label, \"Dreamin'\" became a regional hit and got the attention of Epic Records, who picked up the song for distribution to radio stations and dance clubs around the country. The song peaked at No. 50 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and at No. 15 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Play chart in August 1987. It also reached No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart in September of that year. Epic Records asked Rosenberg if he had enough material for an album. In June 1988, Will to Power released a follow-up single, \"Say It's Gonna Rain\", This song reached No. 49 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart in July 1988 and spent two weeks atop the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Play chart in August and September of that year.\n\nIn the Spring of 1987, after \"Dreamin'\" was released on Rosenberg’s label Thrust records, CBS/Epic and other labels took note of it. The single became an instant hit. Bob Rosenberg was exclusively offered a record deal, and was signed with CBS/Epic Records in April 1987. Although he was signed with just a single, Rosenberg along with his then girlfriend, and one of the five vocalists on the song \"Dreamin’\", Suzi Carr, and her friend, saxophonist Dr. J, began touring and performing back-to-back at different shows nationwide. \n\nRosenberg’s contract included the opportunity to record various albums. Rosenberg began the planning and spent much of 1987 and early 1988 working on new material with a variety of different session vocalists, (Carr, Newman, Lorenzo, and others), and musicians including (keyboardists Lawrence Dermer, Lester Mendez and David Rosenthal). Will to Power’s self-titled debut album, was released on Epic Records in March 1988. Along with the aforementioned songs \"Dreamin'\" and \"Say It's Gonna Rain\", the album contained a medley of two popular rock songs from the 1970s, \"Baby, I Love Your Way\" (a 1976 hit record for Peter Frampton) and \"Free Bird\" (a well-known track by the Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd from 1973). This medley was titled \"Baby I Love Your Way/Freebird Medley (Free Baby)\". Although Epic was reluctant to release this hybrid song as a single, Rosenberg had distributed copies of the song to various radio stations in the Miami vicinity, including WPOW (Power 96). According to Rosenberg, \"they played it, and a few other stations caught onto it, so Epic put it out.\" This song became the group's biggest hit, spending a week at No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and reaching No. 2 on the \"Billboard\" adult contemporary chart in December 1988. It also became the group's highest-charting hit in the UK, reaching No. 6 on the UK Singles Chart. That month, the album reached its peak position of No. 68 on the \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart. A fourth single from the album, \"Fading Away\", which spent two weeks atop the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Play chart in early 1989.\n\nAfter the success of the debut album, Will to Power's follow-up album, \"Journey Home\", was released in late 1990. Rosenberg continued with the group, producing the album, recording vocals and writing most of the songs. The primary female vocalist was then Elin Michaels, a dance-pop singer who sang all of the background vocals (along with Rosenberg's cousin, Rachel Newman, and former Expose singer, Ale Lorenzo), on all of the songs for the first album. Elin, Rachel, and Ale’s background voices are prominent in both, \" Say It's Gonna Rain and \"Fading Away\". Singer Elin Michaels had respectively released some 12\" singles on the Knockout Records label in the mid-1980s. Additional musicians who worked on the album include Donna Allen, Dee Dee Wilde, Wendy Pederson and Harry King on additional vocals, Ed Calle and Tony Concepción on horns, Orlando Hernandez on drums and Lester Mendez on keyboards. The album appeared on the \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart in February 1991, peaking at #178.\n\nThe first single to be released from the album was \"I'm Not in Love\", a cover version of a song by the British art rock band 10cc that was a No. 1 UK and No. 2 US pop hit in 1975. Will to Power's version made the top ten on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, peaking at No. 7 in January 1991 in addition to reaching No. 4 on the \"Billboard\" adult contemporary chart. The song reached No. 29 in the UK pop chart. The follow-up single was a cover of the disco hit \"Boogie Nights\" by the band Heatwave, however this version failed to chart. Other songs on the album include \"Fly Bird\" and \"Clock on the Wall\".\n\nIn 1996, Sony Music Entertainment (the parent company of Epic Records) released a Will to Power compilation album, \"Love Power\", on their Sony Special Products label. It consists of songs that had appeared on the group's first two albums, including their two US pop top ten songs, \"Baby, I Love Your Way/Freebird Medley\" and \"I'm Not in Love\". \n\nThe group released a new album, \"Spirit Warrior\", in 2004 on Straight Blast Records, which was followed by an EP in 2006 titled \"Spirit Warrior: The Remixes\". For this album, Rosenberg collaborated with vocalists such as Gioia Bruno (member of the freestyle music group Exposé), Donna Allen and Wendy Pederson, and remixers such as Giuseppe D and the Wonder Twins.\n\nAllmusic's retrospective reviews of the group's first two albums are generally positive, with \"Will to Power\" receiving four stars out of a possible five and \"Journey Home\" receiving three stars. \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave \"Journey Home\" a D+ rating in a February 1991 review by Bill Wyman, stating that \"the material is predominantly colorless pop songs\". However, music journalist Chuck Eddy mentions tracks from \"Journey Home\" in his 1997 book, \"The Accidental Evolution of Rock 'n' Roll: A Misguided Tour Through Popular Music\". In the section titled \"Automotive Rock\", Eddy mentions that the song \"Journey Home\" is the title track of what may have been his favorite album of the 1990s, that it is seemingly based on the 1981 song \"Cruising with the Deuce\" by Quarterflash and that Rosenberg \"says he's got to keep his motor running, but not only can you feel the machine's momentum (in the rhythm), you can also feel stormclouds settling in (in the voices).\"\n\n\n\n"}

The novel tells the story of Anna Komnene, the daughter of Alexios I Komnenos.\n\nBorn a princess of the Byzantine Empire, Anna is the eldest child of Emperor Alexius of the Byzantine Empire and his wife, Irene Ducaena. With only one younger sister, Maria, Anna is her father's chosen successor and she is certain she will inherit the throne upon Alexius' death alongside her betrothed, Constantine Ducas. The emperor's mother and Anna's namesake, Anna Dalassena, is Alexius' most trusted adviser and strongly opposes Irene out of hatred towards the Ducas family for their intrigues. Under her manipulative grandmother, Anna learns statecraft and diplomacy, and Anna excels at all her lessons, becoming a brilliant scholar, and beginning a manuscript that will detail her father's reign.\n\nWhen Anna is five, Irene gives birth to a son, John Porphygenitus. While \"barbarians\" from foreign lands believe only a son should ascend to power, Anna is dismissive of their attitudes, as are Alexius and Anna Dalassena. However, as Anna matures into a young woman, her grandmother feels threatened by Anna's arrogance and intelligence, realizing that Anna will not be anyone's puppet. Her grandmother moves swiftly to support John as Alexius' successor, devastating Anna as she sees her dreams of power being taken away and given to her brother. Bitter at her grandmother's betrayal, Anna continues to assert she is the true heir to the throne and waits to avenge herself.\n\nAnna's engagement to Constantine Ducas is broken because Constantine dies. She is married off to an older general, Nicephorus Bryennius. As the throne begins to grow further from her reach, Anna pours all her energy into her manuscript. When Alexius dies, John is recognized as the new emperor. Moving to seize what is rightfully hers, Anna conspires with Irene, who remains deeply opposed to Anna Dalassena, to depose John by poisoning him and to install Anna as empress. Anna is furious to find her tutor, Simon, has revealed the conspiracy to John and Anna Dalassena. Out of leniency for his sister and mother, both Anna and Irene are banished to separate convents, never to contact one another, despite Anna Dalassena's demands that both be put to death as examples to the Ducas family. When Anna Dalassena protests that John would not have gotten the throne without her influence, John thanks her for obtaining the throne for him before informing her that he no longer needs her. His words effectively dismiss Anna Dalassena from court, leaving Anna Comnena secretly impressed that her brother will not be a puppet of their grandmother.\n\nWhile she is refused most luxuries at the convent, Anna manages to bring her manuscript, which she has named the \"Alexiad\". Though she reluctantly admits that her brother has demonstrated himself to be a capable ruler thus far, she resolves to finish the \"Alexiad\" without mentioning her brother and be remembered for what she accomplished as a scholar.\n"}

Just before the Indian Mutiny began in 1857, the 23rd took part in the Anglo-Persian War between 1856-1857. During the Indian Mutiny, the regiment remained loyal, like nearly all of the Bombay Army.\n\nThe regiment took part in the Second Anglo-Afghan War from 1879 and the Third Anglo-Burmese War from 1885 to the end of the war in 1887.

War came to an end in the Middle East with the signing of an Armistice with the Ottomans on 30 October 1918.\n\nAfter the war ended, the regiment was involved in efforts to quell an Arab rebellion that broke out in 1920 in the British Mandate of Iraq against the British administration. As part of the reforms of the Indian forces, Outram's Rifles were amalgamated in 1922 with five other regiments, including the 125th Napier's Rifles, to form the 6th Rajputana Rifles.

Davenport\n\nRear Admiral Roy Milton Davenport (June 18, 1909 – December 24, 1987) was an officer in the United States Navy. He is the first individual and only sailor to be awarded five Navy Crosses, the United States military's second highest decoration for valor. Davenport was awarded these military decorations while serving as a submarine commander in the Pacific during World War II.\n\nDavenport made eleven submarine war patrols, six of them as a commanding officer. It was during these six patrols in command of the \"Gato\"-class submarines and that he received five Navy Crosses, two Silver Stars, two Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medals, two Presidential Unit Citations, Combat Action Ribbon, and the Navy Unit Commendation. He was also awarded the Submarine Combat Patrol Insignia with two silver star devices for a total of eleven successful war patrols. These are documented in his autobiography, \"Clean Sweep\", 1986.\n\nA student of Christian Science, Davenport was dubbed the \"praying skipper\" and was known for his daring attacks against Japanese ships, often executed on the surface to gain additional speed. In all, he was credited during the Pacific War with sinking 17 Japanese ships and damaging 10, but this was reduced to 8 by JANAC postwar evaluations. While none of the men under his command were lost, he and his crews experienced many close calls and escapes. He credited his religious faith for his successes.\n\nDavenport was born in Kansas City, Kansas, and grew up in the Midwest. In June 1933, he graduated from the United States Naval Academy as an ensign. In 1935, he married Jane Andre Gorham, who would be his wife for 52 years; together they had two daughters, Delia (Davenport) Gruenig and Bonnie (Davenport) Byhre.\n\nDavenport's first naval assignment was on the battleship . The next year he attended Submarine School in New London, Connecticut. Upon graduation he was temporarily assigned to the training ship until the arrived on the East Coast to be re-engined. After some time in Panama, he arrived in Pearl Harbor in June 1939.\n\nIn 1941, Davenport was serving in , as executive officer under Lieutenant Commander Creed Burlingame. After four patrols aboard, Burlingame recommended Davenport for a command of his own.\n\nBeyond the expected and usual depth charging after attacks on ships, there were close escapes. Once, a Japanese airplane dropped three bombs directly on the \"Silversides\". The sub survived; although during escape, it went into a hard dive with bow planes jammed, exceeding its design depth. At the last moment, Exec Davenport removed a cotter key, enabling the sub to level off to avoid being crushed. On another occasion, a torpedo, half stuck in the firing chamber required re-firing. If unsuccessfully re-fired, it could have sunk the sub. Another time, Davenport had to wrestle a pistol from a drunken gunner's mate who felt that he had been robbed in a dice game. The sailor was removed from the sub in a straitjacket.\n\nDavenport was given command of , replacing Commander Art Taylor, who was relieved at the orders of Admiral Robert English for circulating \"subversive literature\" (a poem critical of English and his staff). \"Haddock\" achieved three successful patrols; Davenport's first patrol in command was off the Palau Islands, sinking two confirmed ships, \"Toyo Maru\" and \"Arima Maru\", for 9,200 tons. His wartime credit was one for 11,900. He was unable to close nearer than to the Japanese aircraft carriers \"Hiyō\" and \"Junyō\". After 39 days at sea, \"Haddock\" went in for extensive refit to repair a defective, potentially lethal, conning tower. At a depth of 415 feet, it had almost imploded. To close the hatch to save the boat from sinking, Davenport hit the hatch with a sledgehammer. The conning tower held, and Haddock escaped.\n\nOn Davenport's second patrol, he returned to the Palaus, where he sank the 5,533-ton \"Saipan Maru\", and on July 26, 1943 they fired a total of fifteen Mark XIV torpedoes at ranges between in four attacks, believing he scored one hit. Credited with one ship sunk for 10,900 tons and damage to another for 35,000 tons, he was awarded his first Navy Cross; this score was later corrected to one ship sunk at 5,500 tons.\nIn August 1943, Davenport was dispatched to Truk, making a 27-day patrol that would earn him a second Navy Cross. He fired four torpedoes on a ship on September 15, claiming two hits and fire aboard the target, which nevertheless tried to ram, leading Davenport to fire two more \"down the throat\". On September 20, he encountered a large tanker, the 19,000 ton \"Tonan Maru II\", and fired six torpedoes from , claiming \"at least three certain hits\". On the night of 21/September 22, he attacked another ship, missing with two torpedoes from , and on the 23rd, firing a total of eight, his last, at another, claiming three hits. For his third patrol, he was credited with three ships sunk, a total of 39,200 tons.\n\nDeparting Pearl Harbor in October, he returned to Truk for another 27-day patrol, and on November 1/2, attacked a freighter and troopship on the surface firing four torpedoes at the freighter at and one at the troopship from . The freighter was claimed to have sunk immediately, the troopship to have caught fire then settle. The next night, encountering three Japanese destroyers, Davenport fired four torpedoes at one of them from , claiming a hit midships, and a sinking. And finally, on 5/November 6, \"Haddock\" found two tankers, firing three bow torpedoes at each from and all four stern tubes at the escort. The stern shots all missed, but Davenport reported hits in both tankers. After reloading, he fired two more torpedoes at each, claiming both tankers sunk. The second Truk patrol earned Davenport credit for five ships and 32,600 tons, including the escort, plus damage to one for 4,000 tons. None were confirmed by postwar JANAC, while Davenport, backed by his executive officers, believe the Japanese attempted to deceive the Allies into thinking the tankers remained in service.\n\nAfterward, \"at his own request\", Davenport was detached for a rest and new construction, and \"Beetle\" Roach was given \"Haddock\". Davenport would return to duty with the new \"Balao\"-class . On September 30, 1944 off Honshu, Davenport fired six torpedoes on two large tankers, a large freighter, and an escort, claiming a hit in one tanker; JANAC confirmed only sinking of a 750-ton freighter, \"Taknuan Maru\".\n\nDavenport weathered a typhoon and, on October 10/11, picked up a convoy of two tankers and one escort. Firing four stern tubes, he claimed three hits. No sinkings were confirmed in Japanese records. The next night, he fired four torpedoes at a Japanese landing craft, believing all missed. Postwar, he was credited with the 1,000 ton \"Transport No. 5\". On 12/October 13, lying off Iro Zaki, Davenport made radar contact with two ships, believing them at first to be aircraft carriers, then battleships, escorted by destroyers. He fired all six bow tubes at one \"battleship\". He claimed hits in one destroyer, suggesting it sank immediately, and at least one hit in the first \"battleship\". He then swung and fired all four stern tubes, his last remaining torpedoes, at the other \"battleship\"; all missed. Back in Majuro, he was credited with three ships of 22,300 tons and damage to a \"Yamashiro\"-class battleship for 29,300 tons, earning him a fourth Navy Cross.\n\nOn his next patrol to Luzon Strait, Davenport led a \"wolfpack\" called \"Roy's Rangers\" consisting of \"Trepang\", James Fulp's \"Segundo\", and Charles Brown's \"Razorback\" He fired twenty-two torpedoes in all, claiming four ships for 35,000 tons; this was reduced postwar to three for 13,000.\n\nAfter completing this, his tenth war patrol, in December 1944, Davenport requested shore duty, and became a maritime engineering instructor at Annapolis. Except for those who earned the Medal of Honor, such as Dick O'Kane, he was the Submarine Force's most decorated member.\n\nDavenport remained in the Navy after the war and saw \"in theater\" service during the Korean War. His last assignment was as commanding officer of the troop transport from 1958 to August 1959 after which he retired from the navy after 26 years of service. Upon retirement, he was promoted to rear admiral in recognition of his combat decorations.\n\nDavenport died on Christmas Eve 1987 at the age of 78.\n\nIn 1954, the popular television program, \"This Is Your Life\" with host Ralph Edwards, recounted his wartime events with close family appearing with him. Davenport's cousin, General Maxwell D. Taylor, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President John F. Kennedy, did not appear as only immediate family and those who interacted in Davenport's wartime adventures, were invited.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2177848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2177848", "title": "Sweet Sensation (trio)", "text": "Sweet Sensation (trio)\n\nSweet Sensation is a female freestyle-dance music trio from The Bronx, New York \n. The group is composed of Betty LeBron, Margie Fernandez, Mari Fernandez, and Sheila Vega (who replaced Mari in 1989). The group was formed in 1986 and released albums until 1992. Their song \"If Wishes Came True\" is their biggest hit, topping the Billboard Hot 100 list for a week in 1990.\n\nSweet Sensation was originally formed in 1985. A suggestion by Margie Fernandez led Betty Lebron to meet with David Sanchez, who was co-managing a group called Sly Fox with Cherrie Shepherd. One afternoon, David came by to meet Betty at Margie's house in Manhattan with a boombox. He recorded Betty singing a capella and passed this recording on to Shepherd. A few weeks later, on March 15, 1985, Margie and Betty had a meeting at Intergalactic Studios with Shepherd. Coincidentally, the act recording in the studio that day was a rap group called The Boogie Boys. One of the members of the group, Joseph \"Romeo J.D.\" Malloy, would later become one of Sweet Sensation's main songwriters, penning several songs on their debut album, \"Take It While It's Hot\".\n\nRomeo's first song after meeting Margie and Betty was a demo called \"Could It Be\", which was recorded in Romeo's home studio by Betty. It was re-recorded at Unique Recording in New York City with Ted Currier of Platinum Vibe Productions as producer. It was at this time that a new chorus was added, and the song was re-titled \"Hooked on You.\" Once the song was finally completed, a girl group was formed. Margie and her sister Mari joined Betty in the group. Sweet Sensation was signed to a production deal with Platinum Vibe Productions, and recording started on their first album, with Betty Lebron on lead vocals. Using \"Hooked on You\" as an introduction, the trio was signed to Next Plateau Records. \"Hooked on You\" was released on the Next Plateau label, along with their second single, \"Victim of Love (Goodbye Baby).\" In 1987, they were picked up by Atco, and their debut album, \"Take It While It's Hot\", was released. The album peaked at #63 on the Billboard pop albums chart and spawned five singles: \"Hooked on You\" (#23), \"Victim of Love (Goodbye Baby),\" \"Take It While It's Hot,\" \"Never Let You Go\" (which reached #1 on the U.S. Dance chart), and \"Sincerely Yours\" (#14).\n\nIn late 1988, Mari left the group and was replaced by Sheila Vega. The artwork of their debut album, a photograph of the trio, was updated to reflect this change. The original album cover featured Betty, Margie, and Mari, but in the 1989 re-pressing of their album, new member Sheila Vega replaced Mari on the cover. The vocals on the album weren't re-recorded after the personnel change, however. \n\nIn 1990, their second album, \"Love Child\", was released, containing what would turn out to be their biggest hit, the ballad \"If Wishes Came True,\" which reached Number One on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nIn 1991, a remix album was released, \"Time to Jam (The Remix Album)\", which turned out to be their last album. That year, Margie and Sheila left the group and were replaced by three new members—Belle, Maya, and Jenae, making them a quartet. They performed as Sweet Sensation for the next few years until Betty LeBron embarked on a solo career.\n\nIn 2004, Sweet Sensation was ranked #391 in the Rock on the Net web site's \"Top 500 Pop Artists of the Past 25 Years\". In 2005, the dance single \"My Body Tu Cuerpo,\" credited as Dynamix Presents Sweet Sensation, was released on Kult Records featuring Betty LeBron on lead vocals (billed as Betty Dee), and produced by Eddie Cumana and Beppe Savoni of Dynamix.\nFor a brief period, the previous members, Margie, Sheila, and Mari reunited to form their own version of Sweet Sensation without lead singer Betty Lebron after sisters Margie and Mari applied for—and then obtained—the trademark rights to the name Sweet Sensation. This led to a case before the trial and appeals board of the US Trademark Patent Office that later canceled the original trademark obtained by the Fernandez sisters, and gave the rights to Lebron and Shepherd after evidence showed that first use and current use rights belonged to Lebron. The group consisting of Margie, Mari, and Sheila disbanded after performing only a few shows. Today, Sweet Sensation is composed of Betty, Belle, and Jenae, and is currently performing throughout the United States. The Sweet Sensation catalog is currently owned by Atco/Atlantic Records.\n\n\n\nmusicrareobscure.blogspot.com"}
{"id": "2177853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2177853", "title": "King's Knight", "text": "King's Knight\n\n\"For the Shovel Knight Character, see Shovel Knight.\"\n\nThe game became Square's first North American release under their Redmond subsidiary Squaresoft, and their first release as an independent company. The 1986 release's title screen credits Workss for programming. \"King's Knight\" saw a second release in 1987 on the NEC PC-8801mkII SR and the Sharp X1. These versions of the game were retitled \"King's Knight Special\" and released exclusively in Japan. It was the first game designed by Hironobu Sakaguchi for the Famicom. Nobuo Uematsu provided the musical score for \"King's Knight\". It was Uematsu's third work of video game music composition.\n\n\"King's Knight\" follows a basic storyline similar to many NES-era role-playing video games: Princess Claire of Olthea has been kidnapped in the Kingdom of Izander, and the player must choose one of the four heroes (the knight/warrior \"Ray Jack\", the wizard \"Kaliva\", the monster/gigant \"Barusa\" and the (kid) thief \"Toby\") to train and set forth to attack Gargatua Castle, defeat the evil dragon Tolfida and rescue the princess.\n\n\"King's Knight\" is a vertically scrolling shooter, where the main objective is to dodge or destroy all onscreen enemies and obstacles. Various items, however, add depth to the game. As any character, the player can collect various power-ups to increase a character's level (maximum of twenty levels per character): as many as seven Jump Increases, seven Speed Increases, three Weapon Increases, and three Shield Increases. There are also Life Ups, which are collected to increase the character's life meter. There are also Life Downs which should be avoided. Other onscreen icons can affect the stage, such as hidden cave entrances/exits and a \"secret revealer,\" which reveals hidden stones that block progress. Finally, there are four types of elements to be collected in each level, which are vital to the completion of the last stage. These elements are simply elements A, B, C, and D.\n\nEach stage has various power-ups, an element of each type, and a cave. Because caves in any given level always house at least one element type (not to mention various power-ups), it is vital that the player finds these. Caves are always hidden and are generally found in the middle of a stage. Caves also have statues that shoot fireballs, and at the end of each cave is a dragon to fight. Once the dragon is defeated, the player can exit the cave and continue with the level.\n\nDifferences were present not only in the Famicom and MSX versions of \"King's Knight\", but in the Japanese and North American versions as well.\n\nThe Japanese (Famicom) version and the American (NES) version of \"King's Knight\" differed little, with the title screen being the only disparity. Each title screen reflected the copyright and publisher.\n\nThe MSX version of \"King's Knight\" differed from the Famicom version in a variety of ways. The opening was modified so that prior to the intro screen, players could specify what type of controller they would like to use (either a keyboard or a joystick). The in-game dynamics were very similar, although some differences exist. In the MSX version, the flanks of the screen were \"closed off,\" while the stage maps have moved slightly, and so some of the items appear to be out of their original locations. Finally, the MSX version may seem easier, because the characters can sustain more damage from attacks.\n\nThe developers also took advantage of technological capabilities available on the MSX. As an upgrade, the MSX port featured more sound channels than the Famicom, and as such many music tracks and sound effects were altered or improved. The MSX version also boasts a wider range of colors, updated graphics, new monster and boss designs (dragons at the end of caves, for example, were replaced with reptilian monsters), and a new sidebar, which displayed the player's life meter, allocated power-ups, and allocated elements. The MSX could not smoothly render vertical scrolling though – unlike the Famicom – so the movement of the graphics is very \"choppy\" in comparison. Some of these changes are very similar to the changes that took place when Square's \"Final Fantasy\" was ported to the MSX2.\n\nOn September 18, 2016, Square Enix announced a remake titled \"King's Knight: Wrath of the Dark Dragon\" for iOS and Android. It was produced by Daisuke Motohashi and developed by Flame Hearts. Developed as a mobile spin-off associated with \"Final Fantasy XV\", the game borrows the original version's scrolling, action role-playing game style and adds a new camera perspective and an orchestral version of the former's chiptune soundtrack. The game is free-to-play with a four-player multiplayer mode.\n\nSquare Enix announced the game at the September 2016 Tokyo Game Show. Its promotional material placed the game in the \"Final Fantasy XV\" universe alongside \"Justice Monsters Five\", another mobile companion game to the series that Square Enix announced earlier in 2016. \"King's Knight: Wrath of the Dark Dragon\" was planned for release on Android and iOS platforms in Japan in 2016, with no announcement for a North American release. The game's release was then postponed to 2017. It was released worldwide on September 13, 2017. End of service was subsequently announced for the game to take place June 26, 2018 - less than a year after its worldwide release.\n\"King's Knight\" is one of the video games to be adapted into a manga titled , published in the Gamest Comics collection from April 1999, and drawn by Kouta Hirano.\n\n\"King's Knight\" was given a 3/10 on IGN and 3/10 as well on Nintendo Life.\n\n"}

She was born in Nyack, New York, moved around throughout childhood from NY to the midwest and back, graduating from senior high school in Severna Park, Maryland before college at Wartburg College in Iowa. Self-taught as a child, she starting at the approximate age of 4 years old on the piano, began busking music in junior high school, getting bar gigs before she even graduated. She lived in Baltimore for the majority of the 1980s and became a fixture at many local clubs in the Baltimore, DC, VA, PA circuit and beyond as she began to build her national touring schedule. Suede's popularity steadily increased and she began playing sold-out shows in some of the US's most respected concert halls and jazz clubs (Birdland, Feinsteins, Kennedy Center, Birchmere, etc.), sharing the stage with fellow headliners such as Melissa Etheridge and Sarah McLachlan, and opening for Janis Ian and Joan Rivers, among others. She began her own record/touring label in 1983, Easily Suede Music, and has toured consistently nationally and internationally since. She currently has 4 CDs and 1 DVD released on the Easily Suede label. Her DVD \"Suede, Live at Scullers Jazz Club\" aired on 54 stations nationally as part of the PBS fund-drive. Her recording of Shirley Eikhard's song \"Emily Remembers\" became the #1 song of the year on WJZW Radio, Washington, DC. Each of her recordings have sold upwards of 10,000 copies with national distribution and airplay.\n\nSuede successfully sued the Sony Corporation in 1993 for trademark violation for introducing and representing a British band named \"Suede\" in the US without doing a required preliminary trademark check with the Library of Congress. The two parties reached a settlement, after two years in legal process, resulting in an agreement that the band's albums would only be promoted and sold in the US under the name \"The London Suede.\"\n\nIn addition to being a vocalist, Suede plays multiple instruments; trumpet, piano, and guitar and is well known for her humor and quick wit in her live shows. She currently lives on Cape Cod.\n\nSuede also toured for 2 years with The Flirtations, seen in the Jonathan Demme film \"Philadelphia\" and was on the group's final album, \"Three.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2177872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2177872", "title": "Parmehutu", "text": "Parmehutu\n\nThe Party of the Hutu Emancipation Movement (, Parmehutu), also known as the Republican Democratic Movement – Parmehutu (\"Mouvement démocratique republicain – Parmehutu\", MDR-Parmehutu), was a political party in Rwanda. The movement emphasised the right of the majority ethnicity to rule and asserted the supremacy of Hutus over Tutsis. It was the most important party of the \"Hutu Revolution\" of 1959–61 that led to Rwanda becoming an independent republic and Hutus superseding Tutsis as the ruling group.\n\nThe party was founded by Grégoire Kayibanda in June 1957 as the Hutu Social Movement, a party of Hutu nationalists who fought for the emancipation of the oppressed Hutu majority. It was renamed on 25 September 1959, and dominated the local elections in 1960, winning 2,390 of 3,125 elected communal council seats and 160 of 229 \"burgomasters\".\n\nIn 1961, parliamentary elections were held alongside a referendum on the Tutsi monarchy of Mwami Kigeri V. MDR-Parmehutu won 35 of the 44 seats in the Legislative Assembly, whilst the referendum saw the end of the monarchy. Kayibanda appointed a government of Hutus, and became president after independence in July 1962. By 1965, it was the only legal party in the country, and the 1965 elections saw Kayibanda run unopposed for the presidency and the party win all 47 National Assembly seats.\n\nUnder the Parmehutu rule Tutsis were severely discriminated against, persecuted and repeatedly massacred, leading to hundreds of thousands of Tutsi fleeing the country. The 1963 Tutsi massacres were described by Bertrand Russell as the worst since the Holocaust; in 1967 another 20,000 Tutsi were killed.\n\nIn the July 1973 coup, Kayibanda was ousted by his cousin Major-General Juvénal Habyarimana who, like other leaders from Rwanda's north \"(abakonde)\", felt marginalised by the Southern-dominated Parmehutu regime. The Parmehutu party was suspended and was officially banned two years later when Rwanda became a one-party state under Habyarimana's new National Revolutionary Movement for Development (MRND), which was dominated by Hutu from the northern and northwestern parts of the country.\n\n"}
{"id": "2177874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2177874", "title": "FoodLand", "text": "FoodLand\n\n\"FoodLand\" is the name of a regional American supermarket chain based in New Stanton, Pennsylvania. The stores' \"F\" logo are a registered trademark of Minnesota-based SuperValu stores, which serves as the chain's main wholesale distributor.\n\nThe Foodland store chain consists of just 26 conventional supermarkets (down from 68 in the late 2000s) in the Eastern United States, including 11 throughout West Virginia, 10 in Alabama, 6 in the Pittsburgh area of western Pennsylvania, and 1 in eastern Kentucky. The company exited the Ohio, Virginia, and Maryland markets in the 2010s. Many of the former stores were converted to the Shop 'n Save brand in the 2010s. For much of the 2000s, their slogan was \"Close to Home\"; it has currently transitioned into \"When You're Hungry for Dinner.\"\n\nThe FoodLand Supermarket concept is unique in that the square footage of each store varies and is based on the size of the community each store serves. Internally within the chain, stores are classified as \"A\" (smaller/medium volume) and \"AA\" (larger/high volume). However, the classification is based on sales volume of each store so some smaller stores that are high volume are \"AA\" and some larger stores with lower sales volume can be grouped in \"A\" As the size of the store is reflective of each community's needs, store size ranges from 12,000 to 60,000 square feet.\n\nThe Foodland ad circular is distributed on a weekly basis. It is typically eight pages and is printed on magazine quality paper. Advertising is planned by store owners/managers in a weekly meeting and is split into two groups, Milton, West Virginia and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. At some of the meetings, both groups are connected via satellite and share sales plans, ideas and concepts.\nThe group concept is unique to other store groups in the United States.\n\nIn an effort to increase the store count and to expand into more rural communities within its trade area, a smaller store concept was rolled out in 2001 named Foodland Express. FoodLand Express stores are \"superettes\" (ranging from 8,000 to 12,000 in square feet). A more limited merchandise selection is carried than what can be found in a standard FoodLand store. They can be found in smaller rural communities or inner city locales that serve a very limited trade area. A shopper can find everything she needs at Foodland Express, but assortments are restricted to the best-selling brands in the best-selling sizes along with a full S.K.U. count of FoodLand's \"family\" of value-priced private-label products. Unlike the limited grocery department, the fresh meat department carries a much larger selection similar to what is carried in the standard FoodLand store concept. Combined deli/bakery departments are usually included in most Foodland Express stores. Originally, this concept used a four-page ad instead of the standard eight-page ad that has been used for many years by FoodLand. The Foodland Express ad was originally smaller in size so that the stores didn't have to carry as many items as a standard Foodland store kept in stock. As the small store concept has developed, it now uses the standard eight-page circular.\n\nThe Foodland Express concept uses a decor package that is similar to what can be found in a larger FoodLand outlet. Base colors are a slight variation and incorporate a black-and-white checkered racing flag design to emphasize the \"get in and out quickly\" nature of the Foodland Express concept.\n\nIn 1996, another store concept was introduced as Foodland Fresh. At the time of its introduction, the Foodland Fresh concept garnered national attention in the supermarket industry as it focused on the perishable departments which continues to be the mass marketer's biggest weakness. Considered innovative at the time, it took the standard conventional supermarket layout and enlarged the perishable departments with upscale lighting and increased merchandise offerings. The Westmoreland Foodland Fresh, located in the west end of Huntington, West Virginia, was the first to be upgraded to this concept and served as its early prototype store. Within a year, many Foodland stores (mostly larger locations) were remodeled and converted to the fresh concept. At more than 50,000 square feet, the Bigley Avenue Foodland in Charleston, West Virginia was the first ground up Foodland Fresh store and was built that same year. After completion, it was the largest independently owned supermarket east of the Mississippi River. Foodland Fresh is more upscale in design and appearance than most conventional supermarkets. Interior decor was designed and installed by Paris Signs of Huntington, WV. By 1999, most Foodland stores had been converted to the Foodland Fresh concept. Outlets that were not large enough to support the fresh concept were remodeled to a similar but noticeably scaled down appearance so that all stores shared a united theme, with the larger Foodland Fresh stores being the upgraded version of the standard Foodland Store.\n\nThe Foodland Plus concept was developed in early 1989 by then Foodland distributor/owner Wetterau Incorporated. The ever-increasing need for larger stores brought this concept into action as a way for larger Foodland stores to differentiate from the smaller stores. This concept was unique as it was envisioned as a smaller version of the \"hypermart\" concept similar to today's Wal Mart Supercenters. It featured extensive general merchandise along with the typical Foodland variety of name brand, private label, and value priced food items. This concept was rather short-lived as Wetterau sold its holdings to Supervalu in 1992, just as the Foodland Plus concept was taking off. Some former Wetterau customers use the Foodland Plus banner to this day but are no longer affiliated with the FoodLand chain supported by Supervalu. Since they were FoodLand stores prior to the Supervalu acquisition, they are allowed to use the name only for the pre-existing FoodLand stores. If they wish to open new FoodLand stores, they must use the FoodLand Plus banner as it is not owned by Supervalu and is considered an abandoned trademark.\n\nWest Kittanning and Ford City, Pennsylvania stores were the original Metrosplash/Fuellinks test sites for their previous gas program which was changed to the Fueland Rollback Rewards program. A few of the larger sized FoodLand stores feature Fuel Centers. Most have a Delicatessan and Bakery along with the traditional grocery store departments. Most Foodland stores use Fujitsu TeamPos systems running StoreNext Scanmaster POS software.\n\nBoth of the test stores closed in 2014. The Ford City location in June, and West Kittanning following in September.\n\nEvery Foodland location is locally owned and operated, with inventory support from SuperValu. To compete with other grocery chains such as Giant Eagle and Shop 'n Save, FoodLand has partnered with Fueland gas stations/convenience stores in the greater Pittsburgh area. Most FueLand sites are located just outside the grocery store.\n\nTo further meet the needs of its customers, Foodland offers an internet shopping service for hard to find food products through its website. Customers can order these items direct and have them delivered to their door. These are items typically stocked only in specialty food retail stores and are hard to locate in general. Many of these items are stocked in the FoodLand stores also. Store managers are instructed to do their best to locate customer requests, using the buying power of SuperValu, who has access to hundreds of manufacturers. If the item is unavailable, a suitable brand is suggested to the customer that is available to the stores.\n\nThe name \"Foodland\" and its corresponding logo are US registered trademarks of SuperValu. Unaffiliated stores named or incorporating the name \"Foodland\" appear throughout the United States, as well as in Australia, Canada, Iceland and Thailand. FoodLand appeared in the 1993 film \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\" as the fictional Lamson's Grocery store's rival; although the film is set in Iowa, where no Foodland stores operate, the store shown is part of the major FoodLand chain.\n\nFoodLand stores with the same logo featuring the distinctive F can be found throughout the US and Canada in various regions. These stores were once affiliated with FoodLand International Corporation, Inc. along with many stores in the chain now based in New Stanton, PA. Foodland International was a group of independent grocers and wholesalers similar to IGA, who unified their efforts in an attempt to compete with the larger chain stores at the time. It was incorporated in 1958 by Davis Wholesale Grocery Company. However the FoodLand name was first used by the Foodland Corporation of Cleveland, Ohio in 1938. Davis acquired the franchise concept of FoodLand by acquisition of another wholesale company that had copyrighted the name and had operated as FoodLand, Inc., and was the direct predecessor to Foodland International. Original FoodLand trademarks were registered by that organization prior to 1958. These trademarks were then acquired by Foodland International mainly for the continued procurement of private labels merchandise. Foodland private labeled branding, allowed independent stores and retailers a useful tool to compete with the larger chains of the time and experienced high growth levels during the 1960s and 1970s. This was primarily the focus of the organization in its early years. The unique aspect of this organization was that its executive arm was composed of actual FoodLand store owners and all decisions pertaining to advertising etc. were made by them. As time went on, the organization grew to include more members and more functions such as television advertising, public affairs, store development, and many other functions. These operations were then advised by Davis Grocery Co. and its later owners, as it was the preferred store franchise used by that wholesale company to attract new retail customers. Davis was later purchased by John Fox of the Fox Grocery Company who then operated using FoodLand International in the same manner as Davis had done in the past. Wetterau Inc., a St. Louis, Missouri based wholesale grocery company purchased Fox in 1984 and continued to support Foodland International as its wholesaler and parent company. Wetterau became a part of SuperValu, Inc. in 1992. By that time, all distribution of Foodland products were limited to retail stores supported by SuperValu. All necessary copyrights for Foodland and the distribution of its products were then transferred to Supervalu at that time\n\nA retailer's convention was held annually in various locales around the world, in such places as Rome, Italy (1972) and Honolulu, Hawaii (1979) (The latter being the home of an unrelated Foodland chain), but included the principals of that chain for the activities at this convention. By the late 1980s the larger alliance had faded, basically due to the retirement of key members, coupled with many wholesalers selling out to larger operators. Many of these stores remain, still operated as FoodLand but supplied by various wholesalers. On August 11, 1992, Wetterau, Inc. registered the current trademark with the distinctive F in a new style of lettering with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. That was the official end of the any ties or additional claims of name usage by the Foodland International Corporation. Shortly afterwards, Wetterau was merged into SUPERVALU HOLDINGS who now owns trademark rights to that design of the FoodLand logo. Any location not currently affiliated with SUPERVALU that still uses the same FoodLand banner was in operation prior to SUPERVALU/Wetterau's registration of the trademark and therefore retain the rights to use the same FoodLand logo.\n\nThe only known \"group\" or chain of FoodLand stores is the one based in New Stanton, PA and distributed by SuperValu. These stores were previously supplied by Wetterau, another wholesale company which was acquired by SuperValu in late 1992. SuperValu has made a concerned effort to revitalize the Foodland name, and their marketing strategy does quite well in the communities they serve, usually the number one or two in market share. Part of this effort included ads placed along the walls of the rink at the Civic Arena for the Pittsburgh Penguins during their Stanley Cup championship years in the early 1990s.\n\nStores with no affiliation to SuperValu are not considered a part of any chain and are remnants of past affiliations with Wetterau/other wholesalers distributing the Foodland private labels. The Foodland label was once found in these stores prior to 1992, but are now only distributed by SuperValu. Many of these stores exist in the Southern United States.\n\nRay Stevens, a longtime music recording artist, used Benson's Foodland Supermarket, located in Hermitage, just outside Nashville, TN. for the setting of his video for \"The Streak\", which peaked at #1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 charts in 1974. In the video, which was actually taped several years after the song's release, Foodland private label merchandise can be seen on the shelves in the background. Benson's Foodland is still in operation as a Foodland outlet, though not a part of the Supervalu Foodland store chain.\n\n"}
{"id": "2177875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2177875", "title": "Saw Mill River Parkway", "text": "Saw Mill River Parkway\n\nThe Saw Mill River Parkway (also known as the Saw Mill Parkway or the Saw Mill) is a north–south parkway that extends for through Westchester County, New York, in the United States. It begins at the border between Westchester County and the Bronx, as the continuation of the Henry Hudson Parkway leaving New York City, and heads generally northeastward to an interchange with Interstate 684 (I-684). At its north end, the parkway serves as a collector/distributor road as it passes east of the hamlet of Katonah. The parkway is named for the Saw Mill River, which the highway parallels for most of its length.\n\nThe Saw Mill serves as an important connection from the Taconic State and Sprain Brook parkways to the Tappan Zee Bridge and New York State Thruway. It is not a limited-access highway as several of its exits are signalized at-grade intersections. The Saw Mill River Parkway is inventoried by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) as New York State Route 987D (NY 987D), an unsigned reference route designation.\n\nThe Saw Mill River Parkway begins at the Bronx–Westchester line in Van Cortlandt Park as a continuation of the Henry Hudson Parkway. The Saw Mill River winds northward and parallels a former railroad grade into Yonkers. Now in the Southeast Yonkers section, southbound there is a ramp to McLean Avenue. Passing Tibbetts Lake, the Saw Mill River winds northward alongside the railroad grade as a four-lane roadway as it enters exit 4, which serves as the western terminus of the Cross County Parkway. Immediately after the Cross County, exit 5 forks off on a 180-degree turn for Yonkers Avenue and nearby Dunwoodie Golf Course. The parkway becomes at-grade after exit 5, entering exit 5A, which services Palmer Road in Northwest Yonkers.\n\nWinding northward through Yonkers, the Saw Mill River Parkway enters exit 7, a ramp to NY 9A and Tuckahoe Road via Rossiter Avenue. After exit 7, the parkway begins paralleling the namesake river and NY 9A, now known as Saw Mill River Road, near the Runyon Heights neighborhood. The railroad grade returns near Odell Avenue overpass on the northbound side. Upon entering exit 9, the parkway enters a series of signaled at-grade interchanges. The first is exit 9, which serves Executive Boulevard in Yonkers. This is followed by Hearst Street at exit 10 and Tompkins Avenue at exit 11. Just north of exit 11, the Saw Mill River Parkway crosses the city line and enters the town of Hastings-on-Hudson. In Hastings-on-Hudson, the Saw Mill River enters exit 12, an at-grade interchange with the terminus of the Farragut Parkway.\n\nThe next exit, designated exit 13, is a non-traffic light intersection with Farragut Avenue on both sides of the highway. The four-lane parkway winds north through Hastings-on-Hudson, passing through several suburban sections of town. Keeping in close contact with NY 9A, the Saw Mill River and the railroad grade, exit 14 splits off southbound at Clarence Avenue. Exit 15 also forks off southbound at an intersection with Cliff Street before the Saw Mill River Parkway crosses into Dobbs Ferry. Upon entering Dobbs Ferry, the parkway enters an intersection with Lawrence Street (exit 16) and creeping closer to the New York State Thruway (I-87). In Dobbs Ferry, the parkway enters exit 17, the first full interchange since Tuckahoe Road, connecting to Ashford Avenue and NY 9A.\n\nContinuing northbound through Dobbs Ferry, the southbound parkway enters an intersection with Cyrus Field Road before crossing into Irvington. Through Irvington, the Saw Mill River Parkway parallels the Thruway and the river before turning northeast and crossing into Greenburgh and exit 20. Exit 20 serves the New York State Thruway northbound via a flyover ramp. After exit 20, the Saw Mill River Parkway proceeds northeast on a parallel of NY 9A. Continuing alongside the namesake river, the parkway leaves Greenburgh for Elmsford, entering exit 21E and exit 21W, which services NY 119 (Main Street) via separate ramps. After a dart to the northwest, the Saw Mill River Parkway crosses under the Cross Westchester Expressway (I-287). While there is no ramp northbound, exit 22 forks southbound to the westbound Cross Westchester.\n\nCrossing back into Greenburgh, the Saw Mill River Parkway continues northwest away from the Saw Mill River. After turning northbound, the parkway enters the Eastview section of Greenburgh, reaching exit 23, which serves Saw Mill Road and Neperan Road. Exit 23 is the only interchange in Greenburgh as the parkway proceeds into the town of Mount Pleasant. In Mount Pleasant, the parkway enters exit 25 northbound, a small ramp to NY 9A (Saw Mill River Road). Crossing over the Saw Mill River once again, the parkway winds northeast into exit 26 near an overpass of NY 9A and NY 100 (Saw Mill River Road). Exit 26, just to the east of NY 9A/NY 100, services the Taconic State Parkway, Bronx River Parkway and Sprain Brook Parkway in the center of Graham Hills County Park via several flyover ramps. Just to the southeast of the interchange is the Hawthorne Metro-North Railroad station.\nThe Saw Mill River Parkway crosses northeast through Graham Hills County Park, paralleling the Harlem Line and NY 141 through Mount Pleasant. The parkway passes west of the former Thornwood station before turning northwest and away from NY 141. Just after the turn, exit 27 comes at-grade, a junction with Marble Avenue, which connects to NY 141. The parkway runs along a short westbound stretch, crossing into the village of Pleasantville. Going northward in Pleasantville, exit 28 forks off northbound only to Bedford Road, which connects to downtown Pleasantville. Proceeding southbound, exit 29 accesses NY 117 (Pleasantville Road). The parkway turns northeast and enters exit 30 for Grant Street near the Pleasantville Metro-North station.\n\nThe Saw Mill River Parkway and the Harlem Line parallel once again in the northern reaches of Pleasantville, paralleling the Saw Mill River into the town of New Castle. Now in the hamlet of Chappaqua, exit 32 southbound accesses NY 120 at Mill River Road. Nearby this junction is the Chappaqua Metro-North station. After crossing under NY 120, the northbound exit 32 connects to Hunts Place, which connects to NY 120. Running along a hillside in New Castle, the parkway becomes a divided highway for a short distance, becoming a two-lane roadway northbound. No interchange is present along this stretch and the lanes come back together just south of exit 33, an at-grade intersection with Readers Digest Road. At this interchange, the parkway has access to the former Global Headquarters of Reader's Digest and nearby NY 117.\nThe parkway continues northeast through the town of New Castle, passing northwest of the Mount Kisco Country Club before entering the village of Mount Kisco. Just southwest of the Mount Kisco Metro-North station, the parkway and railroad fork in different directions, with the parkway turning north into exit 34, an at-grade interchange with NY 133 (West Main Street). In the northern reaches of Mount Kisco, exit 36 services Croton Avenue from the southbound lanes. Just to the north, the Saw Mill River Parkway enters exit 37, a junction with Kisco Avenue and nearby Pines Bridge Road (unsigned County Route 1323). Now in the town of Bedford, the parkway enters exit 38, two separate at-grade intersections for Green Lane. Green Lane is also the last at-grade intersection on the Saw Mill River Parkway northbound.\n\nCrossing south of Bedford Hills Memorial Park, the Saw Mill River Parkway enters the hamlet of Bedford Hills. In Bedford Hills, the parkway enters exit 39, which connects to the hamlet and NY 117 (Bedford Road). Also present at this interchange is the Bedford Hills Metro-North station. The parkway divides once again through Bedford Hills, paralleling NY 117 through the community. The parkway then enters exit 42, an interchange for NY 117 and Railroad Avenue. At Harris Road, NY 117 crosses over the parkway, paralleling the northbound lanes of the Saw Mill River Parkway on a nearby bypass. NY 117 soon merges into the Saw Mill River Parkway (exit 43 southbound) before the Saw Mill River Parkway enters the right-of-way for Interstate 684, where the parkway terminates just east of Katonah.\n\nThe Saw Mill Parkway started construction in 1926. By 1930, it had reached Route 119 in Elmsford. Construction had only reached Chappaqua by 1940 when World War II halted any further progress. The Saw Mill Parkway was constructed along the Saw Mill River along with a sewer which was to both drain sewage from Yonkers and act as flood control for points north. The full length of the parkway was opened in 1955.\n\nThe Parkway once fed into the accident-prone Hawthorne Circle, a former roundabout at the intersection of the Taconic Parkway extension from the Bronx River Parkway, Taconic State, and Saw Mill River parkways. In 1972 the circle was rebuilt as a three-level interchange.\n\nNYSDOT has maintained the Saw Mill River Parkway since 1980, after abolition of the East Hudson Parkway Authority. Under NYSDOT, the 25¢ toll between exits 3 and 4, which was originally implemented by Westchester County in 1936, was removed on October 31, 1994, with the last tour just before midnight. The tolls were abolished on the Saw Mill River and Hutchinson River parkways in November 1994.\n\nFrom October 1990 into the Summer of 1992, NYSDOT built the Katonah Bypass and converted the segment between there and Interstate 684 into an overlap with part of a realigned NY 117.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2177880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2177880", "title": "Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984", "text": "Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984\n\nThe Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 (codified at ) was an act of Congress passed on October 30, 1984 to promote competition and deregulate the cable television industry. The act established a national policy for the regulation of cable television communications by federal, state, and local authorities. Conservative Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona wrote and supported the act, which amended the Communications Act of 1934 with the insertion of \"Title VI—Cable Communications\". After more than three years of debate, six provisions were enacted to represent the intricate compromise between cable operators and municipalities.\n\nThe scholarly article, \"Perceived Impact of the Cable Policy Act of 1984,\" published in the \"Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media\" in 1987, described its objective as follows:\n\nThe new law attempted to strike a delicate balance between the FCC, local governments, and marketplace competition, where in the past, each of these entities had vied for dominance. The Cable Act was to be the solution to the ongoing problem of who, or what, should exercise the most power over local cable operations.\n\nIn order to balance power between cable television operators and the government, the act established regulations regarding franchise standards and proceeds that would attempt to strengthen the development of cable systems. The act gave municipalities, governing bodies of cities and towns, principal authority to grant and renew franchise licenses for cable operations. By establishing an orderly process for franchise renewal, the act protected cable operators from unfair denials of renewal. However, in order to be granted a franchise renewal, the act specified that cable operators' past performances and future proposals had to meet the federal standards in the new title. The act was meant to reduce an unnecessary regulation that could have potentially brought about an excessive economic burden on cable systems.\n\nIn return for establishing franchise standards and procedures, the act specified that cable operators were expected to be receptive to their local communities' needs and interests. \nCongress recognized the vital role of cable television in encouraging and providing a place for free expression. This provision assured that cable communications provide the general public with \"the widest possible diversity of information sources and services.\" Through this statute, Congress attempted to uphold the First Amendment interest of cable audiences to receive diversified information as specified in the \"Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Commission\" court case of 1969.\n\nThis provision declared that state and local authorities should allow, but not mandate, that this type of information be distributed via non-commercial Public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable TV channels. Furthermore, it prohibited cable operators from exerting any type of editorial control over program content broadcast through PEG channels and freed them from any potential liability for the content. The act lifted programming rules and subscription fees. It was this provision that inspired Senator Barry Goldwater to begin his work on the Cable Communications Act of 1984.\n\nThe Cable Communication Act of 1984 added \"Title VI—Cable Communications\" to the Communications Act of 1934. The title was originally divided into the following sections:\n\n\nIn 1972, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued the \"Third Report and Order.\" The order was enacted to encourage consumer choice and innovation among video devices. The regulations adopted in the order established requirements for broadband, cellular, and wireline Personal Communications Services (PCS) carriers in compliance with the assistance capability requirements prescribed by the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act. The FCC hoped that the newly adopted regulations would generate a competitive marketplace for various devices capable of accessing cable video services by allowing consumers to purchase smart video devices that were compatible with all multichannel video programming services. This would allow consumers the freedom to change service providers without changing their entertainment devices. The \"Third Report and Order\" resulted in the top 100 U.S. television markets providing three Public-access television channels, each for Public-access television, Educational-access, or Government-access television (GATV) (PEG) use. If demand was low for all three channels in a specific market, cable companies had the jurisdiction to supply fewer channels. At least one PEG channel was required at all times.\n\nIn 1976, the regulation was expanded to include cable television systems in communities with 3,500 or more subscribers. Cable companies saw the regulation by the federal government as an unlawful intrusion into their business practices and immediately started to challenge its legality. In the court case \"United States v. Midwest Video Corp.,\" the Midwest Video Corporation sued the FCC for overstepping its authority in requiring Public-access television channels. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the FCC's requirements for local origination facilities. However, in 1979, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Midwest Video Corp. stating that the FCC's new requirements exceeded the agency's statutory powers as granted to them by Congress and as required by cable operators to provide Public-access television. The FCC was interfering with the agency's First Amendment rights. After the Supreme Court's decision, PEG advocates started work on what became the Cable Communications Act of 1984.\n\nThe need for an act to determine who holds regulatory authority for cable communications was quite evident, however it took time to reach an agreement. Negotiations for the act lasted nearly two years and agreements moved back and forth between the House and the Senate. The two parties involved in the negotiations were the National League of Cities (NLC) and the National Cable & Telecommunications Association (NCTA), formerly the National Cable Television Association. These parties worked to lobby Congress for their respective members, who represented diverse populations and had firm, unyielding interests. Instead of having Congress determine the outcome of a stalemate, the two organizations tried to present a unified front. This was a strategic move meant to increase the likelihood that the bill would be passed in both the House and the Senate.\n\nThe act began as bill S. 66 in the Senate where it was passed on June 14, 1983 and moved on to the House. The companion bill, H.R. 4103, in the House was passed on October 1, 1984 and returned to the Senate where modifications were made to conjoin the texts. The bill was officially passed on October 11, 1984 and signed by President Ronald Reagan on October 30, 1984. During negotiations, the agreements were voided four times. The National League of Cities (NLC) voided agreements three times because cable companies were freed from rate regulation, given renewal expectancy, and could default on promises in certain circumstances. On the other hand, the National Cable & Telecommunications Association (NTCA) voided agreements once because they felt that another Supreme Court ruling would provide the industry with better rate deregulation than under the present FCC regulations or the bill.\n\nThe result of the act was an intricate, minimally influential agreement between cable operators and municipalities. It has been highly debated for its effectiveness, because evidence shows that unaffiliated television programming on leased access channels was avoided and rarely appeared. As a title of the larger Communications Act of 1934, the Cable Communications Act of 1984 has been amended and revised with the Cable Act of 1992, also referred to as Cable Television Protection and Competition Act, and the Telecommunications Act of 1996.\n\nThe Cable Communications Act of 1984 had minimal advantages, because it was enacted around a strong legislative agreement between the demands of cable operators and the demands of the public. During the negotiation process, there was relatively little public participation, meaning cable consumers and public, educational, and government access (PEG) advocates were left vulnerable to cable operators' enforcement and decisions.\n\nThere was dramatic growth in the cable industry once the act went into effect. However, it remained largely in the hands of few local monopolies that were able to determine the content of the programs and set the rates for services and channels on their system. These changes in authority were not immediate, but evolved over the course of a few years. Cable consumers were outraged with the increases in prices and services, whereas municipalities were annoyed with violated contracts. Many of these outcomes can be attributed to the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) interpretation of Congress' mandates, which contained poor choice of language and confusion over the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nCable consumers' complaints about the outcomes led to policy discussions in the late eighties and early nineties in which public interest was considered but not represented. If monopolies were broken apart and competition was restored, then many of the problems would likely be resolved. Cable operators would not refuse to carry programs and services with popular demand, and prices would return to appropriate and economical rates.\nIn order to address this problem, the Cable Television Protection and Competition Act of 1992 was passed to regulate cable television rates that cable operators charged consumers.\n\nThe law, intending to grant privileges to local community members by allowing them to require PEG channels also allowed these municipalities to decide against PEG requirements. In franchise agreements, contracted between cable operators and municipalities, the municipality could specify a PEG channel requirement and later opt out of these channels, keeping the cable television franchise fees for their general fund and supplying their communities with no PEG outlets or channel capacity. Since its approval, many public-access television centers have closed as a result of the opt-out provision.\n\nSince the act prevented cable operators from regulating publicly generated content, much controversy developed around what was allowed to appear on these channels. A public-access television center in Eau Claire, Wisconsin was faulted for televising a video created by Christian Bangert, a man convicted of murdering a city police officer. The tape was shown repeatedly during Bangert's trial, and many people felt its airing was in bad taste. Across the country, controversial content such as explicit sex and promotion of Nazi groups have aired via PEG channels. Congress, in an attempt to protect viewers from indecent programming, passed the Cable Television Protection and Competition Act of 1992, which allowed the FCC to establish rules requiring cable operators to prohibit particular shows. In 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that the law was unconstitutional claiming that cable operators should never be required to act on behalf of the federal government to control expression in relation to content.\nCommercial leased access did not provide cable subscribers with a diversity of information as it was required, because it was avoided and never mandated by local franchising authority. In the 1998 court case \"Time Warner Entertainment Co. vs. FCC,\" the court deemed the act ineffective in terms of unaffiliated programming. \"The 1984 legislation did not accomplish much. Unaffiliated programming on leased channels rarely appeared.\" The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act reinforced its intent that leased access to provide a diversity of information to subscribers as determined by the cable operators. The \"Time Warner Entertainment Co. vs. FCC\" court also upheld the provision mentioned above.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2177906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2177906", "title": "Living Dead", "text": "Living Dead\n\nLiving Dead is a blanket term for various films, series, and other forms of media that all originated from, and includes, the 1968 horror film \"Night of the Living Dead\" conceived by George A. Romero and John A. Russo. The loosely connected franchise predominantly centers on different groups of people attempting to survive during the outbreak and evolution of a zombie apocalypse.\n\nAfter the film's initial success, the two creators split in disagreement regarding where the series should head. Romero went on to direct five additional \"Dead\" films, while Russo branched off into literary territory, writing \"Return of the Living Dead\", which was later loosely adapted into a film of the same name and would have its own franchise, and \"Escape of the Living Dead\".\n\nThe term may also refer to the reanimated human corpses that feast on the flesh and/or brains of the living seen in the films.\n\nAs of its latest installment, \"Survival of the Dead\", Romero's \"Dead\" series includes six films all written and directed by Romero himself. Labeled \"Trilogy of the Dead\" until \"Land of the Dead\", each film is laden with social commentary on topics ranging from racism to consumerism. The films are not produced as direct follow-ups from one another and the only continuation is the epidemic of the living dead. This situation advances with each film, but with different characters, and the time moves ahead to the time when they were filmed, making the world's progression the only interlocking aspect of the series. The fifth film does not continue the depiction of the progress of the world; instead it goes back to the beginning of events from the first film, but is nonetheless contemporary as the sequels are. The films deal with how different people react to the same phenomenon ranging from citizens to police to army officials and back again. There are no real happy endings to the films, as each takes place in a world that has gotten worse since the last time we saw it, the number of zombies ever increasing and the fate of the living remnant always in the balance.\n\nRomero tried to make each movie unique from the previous, but this led to some of his more serious works, like \"Day of the Dead\", receiving a worse reception compared to his spoof-like film \"Dawn of the Dead\". He explained this in an interview with \"Telegraph\" film reviewer Tim Robey saying, \"You know, I’ve made six zombie films, I’ve tried consciously to make each one different from the next. But that’s not what people want these days. They want the same thing! I don’t know if that’s part of this television mentality, where people tune in every week to see the same thing.\". Romero does not consider any of his \"Dead\" films sequels since none of the major characters or story continue from one film to the next. The one exception is that the military officer from \"Diary of the Dead\" (Alan van Sprang), who robs the main characters, is a main character in \"Survival of the Dead\" as well.\n\nGeorge A. Romero's \"Dead\" series includes:\n\nRemakes have been made for two of the original films with the involvement of some of the original cast and crew members:\n\nDirected by Tom Savini, former special make-up effects artist, who worked on \"Dawn of the Dead\" and \"Day of the Dead\" while George A. Romero rewrote the screenplay. The plot of the film follows closely the 1968 original, where Barbara, Ben, the Cooper family and Tom Landry and his girlfriend Judy Rose Larson are trapped in a rural farmhouse in Pennsylvania trying to survive the night while the house is being attacked by mysteriously reanimated ghouls, otherwise known as zombies.\n\nDirected by Zack Snyder. A group of strangers: Ana, Police Sergeant Kenneth Hall, Michael, Andre and his pregnant wife, Luda, break into a nearby mall where they are confronted by three living guards – C.J., Bart and Terry – who make them surrender their weapons in exchange for refuge. The group secures the mall, then heads to the roof where they see another survivor, Andy, who is stranded alone in his gun store, across the zombie-infested parking lot. The next day more survivors arrive at the mall and are let in. After some of the survivors start dying from zombie attacks and any hope of being rescued gone, the group decides to fight their way to the Milwaukee marina and travel on Steve's yacht to an island on Lake Michigan.\n\nThere are currently two distinct franchises utilizing the \"Living Dead\" moniker. The first was \"Return of the Living Dead\", which originated as a novel written in 1978 by John A. Russo. It was later adapted to a film by Dan O'Bannon, which spawned its own series of movies, with a total of four sequels. This could be seen more as a spinoff of \"Night of the Living Dead\" rather than sequels, as the first movie treats \"Night of the Living Dead\" as a movie that was based on real events.\n\nRusso and producer Tom Fox planned to bring \"Return of the Living Dead\" to the screen offering O'Bannon the director's seat, he accepted on the condition he could rewrite the film radically so as to differentiate it from Romero's films. O'Bannon discarded Russo's script in its entirety and rewrote it, retaining only the title and changing the \"rules\" significantly. His alterations to the canon include the zombies' fixation on brains alone (whereas Romero/Russo zombies will devour any part of a living human), the ability to move rapidly and communicate (despite physical defects that would render such activity impossible), and the ability of 2–4–5 Trioxin to resurrect \"any\" deceased life form, regardless of how long the decedent has been interred. Although Russo and O'Bannon were only directly involved with the first film in the series, the rest of the films, to varying degrees, stick to their outline and \"rules\" established in the first film.\n\nDan O'Bannon's \"Return of the Living Dead\" series includes:\n\nThen, in 1998, Russo went back to the original \"Night of the Living Dead\" to reshoot extra sequences into the film. This version, which was officially named \"Night of the Living Dead: 30th Anniversary Edition\", added a subplot, alternate opening, and new score. Russo followed this with another Living Dead film, \"Children of the Living Dead\".\n\nWhile the two kinds are similar in appearance, there are certain distinguishing details:\n\nRomero's original \"Night of the Living Dead\" explains that an unknown phenomenon causes re-animation of the brain. Instead of being spread from person to person, the phenomenon presents itself in any human that has recently died from any cause (except those that destroy the physical structure of the brain). The first animated corpses appear in many locations simultaneously, quickly reaching pandemic levels. Characters speculate about the cause of the phenomenon; suggestions at various times include a spaceborne virus, divine punishment, radiation from a satellite returning from Venus, or that \"there's no more room in Hell\". While bites from these reanimated creatures are uniformly lethal, by mechanics unknown, death by other means would have the same result, so a bite is not necessary. It is suggested in \"Day of the Dead\" that the immediate amputation of bitten limbs may prevent victims from dying, but while the treatment is attempted, its success is never conclusively demonstrated. In George Romero's original \"Day of the Dead\" idea, a person was to have his bitten arm amputated, but still return as a zombie. \"Survival of the Dead\" shows that, in the rare instance of a living person biting the undead, that person will become infected. Many characters in films (including George Romero himself) have referred to the bitten area as the \"infected area\" or an \"infection\".\n\nThe state of zombification seen in O'Bannon's \"Return of the Living Dead\" series is induced by the chemical compound Trioxin, an extremely toxic substance found in a gaseous state at standard temperature and pressure. Depending on the film in the series, Trioxin zombies may or may not be able to contaminate living humans with Trioxin via bite. Very small amounts of Trioxin are sufficient to have full effect, and bodies need not be fresh to be re-animated. Both factors were illustrated in the first two films, wherein Trioxin seeped through several feet of earth to reach graves several decades old and animate the occupants (\"The Return of the Living Dead\" even depicted a near-skeleton coming out of its grave). If a zombie corpse is stored for too long in a sealed container, the decomposition process will generate noxious gases containing trace amounts of Trioxin, so the drum can only be safely opened in a sealed lab environment. The requirement of Trioxin exposure makes containment to a specific area or group of people somewhat easier than Romero's plague (though the extreme tenacity of the zombies may mitigate this advantage).\n\nRomero's zombies have very limited to no memory of their previous life. But they all remember how to walk, and how to use their hands for several tasks (such as striking or holding something or someone). They recognize many objects such as cars, houses and other structures, and they recognize the doors in order to enter them. As characters state in \"Dawn of the Dead\", the zombies are in the mall since it was \"an important place in their lives\". They also kept the instinct of eating and biting. In \"Day of The Dead\", the zombie dubbed 'Bub' is experimented on and trained by the scientist Logan and recalls how to use a razor, a telephone, and a book. When Capt. Rhodes walks in the room, Bub salutes him, fires an unloaded pistol at him, and later in the movie shoots Capt. Rhodes. In \"Land of the Dead\", the undead retained some memory of their past lives, allowing them to use tools they remember operating, and even display emotion, giving some of Bub's intelligence to other zombies.\n\nThe zombies in the \"Return of the Living Dead\" series retain their full memories as of their time of death, whether or not they were reanimated immediately or after long interment.\n\nRomero's zombies initially lack full cognitive function and act only on a single drive: the need to seek and consume living flesh. \"Night of the Living Dead\" depicted zombies eating animals as well as humans. The zombies have no true physiological need for flesh, nor can their expired digestive organs derive sustenance from it at all. This was discovered by Dr. Logan (nicknamed \"Frankenstein\") during his many experiments on \"living\" zombie specimens and reported to Sarah in \"Day of the Dead\". The animated dead retain vague impulses derived from former living behavior. For instance, zombies often return to specific locations they frequented when alive (examples from the original \"Dawn of the Dead\", hordes of zombies are compelled to congregate in a shopping mall, and one zombie knows where to find the secret hideout containing its still-living former companions). Lacking immediate victims to hunt, zombies will often fumble through crude motions reminiscent of life activities, often when prompted by a familiar artifact such as a telephone or car. With stimulus, it is possible for some specimens to begin to remember more of the common activities they performed while alive and achieve a basic functioning intelligence. In \"Day of the Dead,\" the zombie nicknamed Bub was \"educated\" into docility by Dr. Logan, learned (or remembered) how to operate a handgun and even developed a childlike affection for its instructor. In \"Land of the Dead,\" the zombie known as Big Daddy developed sophisticated cognitive function on his own, felt affection and empathy for his fellow zombies (even putting some out of their misery when they were injured), could teach other zombies how to use objects (including weapons) and devised crude strategies for bypassing the defenses of the living humans who had destroyed many of his fellows. The more intelligent zombies like Bub and Big Daddy retain their hunger for living human flesh, but can put off immediate gratification if doing so offers a chance for a more significant reward later.\n\nIn O'Bannon's universe, if bodies are still in good condition when they are reanimated, then the resulting zombies really are capable of the same things as normal living humans. Basically, they are like normal humans but with an uncontrollable need to eat brains, which ease the great and constant pain felt from their own decomposition. Depending on their own intelligence, from the previous life, they can actually resist their need for eating brains to the benefit of survival and to elaborate some \"brain-hunting\" tactics. For instance, a rotten, half-melted zombie dubbed \"Tarman\" desperately tries to pull down a closet door with a winch in order to catch one of the protagonists, Tina, his intended victim. He fails to get Tina, but manages to eat one of her friends who comes to her rescue. This also goes as far as posing as a normal living human (like a cop signaling cars to stop on the side) or calling friends or other people and asking them for help, basically anything to attract and trap new living fresh brains when they get close enough. It is also worth noting that, as seen in \"Return of the Living Dead Part 2\", these zombies will act communally, for example waiting to open a gate for all the other zombies rather than simply taking the brains for themselves.\n\nRomero's zombies are slow and shambling. In interviews, George Romero has attributed this quality to rigor mortis, and to the poor condition of their ankles. A sheriff in \"Night of the Living Dead\" sagely suggests that their limited mobility is due to the fact that \"they're dead, they're...all messed up.\" In \"Diary of the Dead\" (2007, post \"Dawn of the Dead\" remake) the director of the student horror film tells his living dead actor (a mummy, in this case) not to move quickly because \"if you run that fast your ankles are going to snap off.\" When that character later becomes an actual zombie and shambles after a victim the director says \"See? I told you dead things move slow!\" The cemetery zombie in \"Night of the Living Dead\" and the two zombie children in \"Dawn of the Dead\" (1978) are the only running zombies in the series.\n\nO'Bannon's Trioxin-contaminated zombies can run if not physically injured and display quite normal mobility if not too decomposed. They have the added advantage of remaining mobile even if significant body mass is lost. Several times, zombies who have lost their legs remain agile and quick through the use of their arms.\n\nIn Romero's series, zombies never get much beyond basic grunts and groans or even screams. The aforementioned zombie Bub makes a praiseworthy effort to say \"Hello Aunt Alicia,\" but the result is largely incomprehensible. Big Daddy in \"Land of the Dead\" was able to crudely laugh after finding a jackhammer.\n\nIn the \"Return of the Living Dead\" series, a zombie can speak normally (even if its lungs, trachea, and facial muscles are largely missing) but it tends to only be one word (\"brains!\") or any real conversation will tend to lean towards their attraction to the listener's brain, how good it must taste and the speaker's overwhelming desire to consume it. There is a glaring exception to this in \"Return of the Living Dead 3\", involving a very fresh corpse that had not even been buried yet.\n\nThe only way a Romero zombie can die is if its brain is destroyed. Zombies can also be burned as shown in \"Night of the Living Dead\". A zombie's mobility may be hampered by structural damage, but such damage will do nothing to reduce the \"life force\" driving the body. Body parts severed from an undead brain will become inanimate. Simply removing the head does not kill the zombie; the head would remain alive, as shown in \"Day of the Dead\".\n\nIn contrast, a typical O'Bannon zombie simply cannot be deactivated short of complete destruction. Any severed body parts will still remain animate, resulting in two or more moving parts. Therefore, decapitation produces both an animate head and an animate body wandering around still trying to catch a living human. There are only two known ways to permanently kill a zombie. One is completely burning the body (as seen in the cremation scene from \"The Return of the Living Dead\"), though burning the body releases Trioxin-laced smoke into the air, which can combine with clouds to create Trioxin-laced rain. Another way is electrocuting the undead until they cease to move or squirm (see \"Return of the Living Dead Part II)\". In the third film scientists invented an endothermic chemical dart that freezes the brain, incapacitating the zombie, but its effective duration is wildly unpredictable. This zombie endurance is nevertheless contradicted in both the fourth and fifth films in the series, where the zombies are easily destroyed by attack, including attacks that do not damage the brain. Another discontinuity within the O'Bannon series is that, in the fourth film, the zombies do not seem to be capable of running, as they tend to move as slow as the zombies in the Romero series.\n\nThere are also some other films that have been released as sequels to various films in Romero's \"Dead\" series, most likely to ride on the name recognition that Romero's films enjoy. They have been produced due to the various mix-ups with the copyright and ownership of the movies, Romero himself owns only \"Dawn of the Dead\" from his first four films.\nRomero is often positive towards derivations of his work, stating that any new film in the horror genre is a step forward, whether completely original or a 'copycat'.\n\nDirected by Lucio Fulci. Also known as \"Zombie\" in the U.S. and as \"Zombie Flesh Eaters\" in the U.K. The film that was already in production when \"Dawn of the Dead\" was released, but was renamed to be a sequel upon its release (\"Dawn of the Dead\" was titled \"Zombi\" in Italy). This movie has a history of official and unofficial sequels itself (see Zombi series).\n\nDirected by Ana Clavell and James Dudelson. While billed as a sequel to \"Day of the Dead\", as Taurus Entertainment Company holds the original's copyright, it has no actual ties to the original \"Day of the Dead\" or the series (although the prologue is set in Pittsburgh 1968).\n\nTaurus Entertainment Company eventually announced plans in August 2009 to produce a sequel, with a working title-turned-official title, \"Day of the Dead: Epidemic\", which is set to be the third installment of the series.\n\nDirected by Jeff Broadstreet. The film is a remake/reimagining of the original film made in a 3D format. The original's status as public domain made it possible to produce this film without the involvement of either Romero or Russo.\n\nDirected by Steve Miner, the story is located in Leadville, Colorado, where the couple of Trevor (Michael Welch) and Nina (AnnaLynne McCord) find themselves in a town suddenly sealed off by military forces (Mena Suvari, Ving Rhames and Nick Cannon). People begin acting strangely and the dead come back to life, with the couple and the soldiers trying to escape.\n\nThis film is a sequel to \"Night of the Living Dead 3D\" and is not the same as \"Night of the Living Dead: Reanimated\" (2009) , which is an animated film using various techniques to retell the story of the original film.\n\nIn January 2018, a second reimagining of \"Day of the Dead\" was released, titled \"Day of the Dead: Bloodline\".\n\nThere have also been ultra-low budget parodies such as:\n\nDirected by Kevin S. O'Brien. A parody of the original film, where a satellite crashes to Earth bringing radiation that promptly animates – as opposed to \"re\"-animating – all manner of homicidal bread, from buns to biscuits to Communion wafers.\n\n\"Night of the Day of the Dawn\" is the shortened title of a parody created by James Riffel, which is the classic \"Night of the Living Dead\" film with redubbed comedic dialogue and some new clips. The complete title of the movie is: \"Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2\".\n\nDirected by Lloyd Kaufman. After a fictional fried chicken franchise opens a restaurant on the location of an Indian burial ground, the chicken corpses come to life, wreaking havoc on the site\n\nDirected by J.F. Kinyon. A short-film parody of the original George Romero film, a zombie attacks a couple in an old graveyard to impress his zombie girlfriend.\n\nThere have also been films that pay homage to the genre:\n\nDirected by Edgar Wright. The film is about an unmotivated slacker who must cope with a zombie uprising, in London, while trying to sort his life out. Simon Pegg notes in the interview on the DVD Release of \"Shaun of the Dead\" and in an interview on BBC Radio 1 prior to the film's release that they sought George A. Romero's blessing and acknowledgement or the film would not have been released. Simon Pegg comments that \"George in fact loved it so much, we [Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright] were asked to be in the film \"Land of the Dead\" as leading characters, but we said no, no way, definitely got to be zombies!\" \"Shaun of the Dead\" features numerous references to not only Romero films, but several other horror/science fiction movies too.\n\nDirected by Andrew Currie. The film takes place after the zombie apocalypse, in a small, safe, idyllic 1950s-style town. In this film zombies are kept as slaves or pets, until something inevitably goes wrong.\n\nDirected by Gregg Bishop. The film is about a high school prom in Georgia which is unexpectedly interrupted when a graveyard, next to a power plant, becomes the sudden source of reanimated cadavers. As zombies march on the high school, a motley group of dateless teenage outcasts takes on the zombies and saves the day.\n\nDirected by Milan Konjević and Milan Todorović. Also known as \"Apocalypse of the Dead\" in the U.K. and U.S., \"Zone of the Dead\" is a Serbian zombie horror film starring Ken Foree from the original \"Dawn of the Dead\" and its remake. The movie is in English and it has been released by Epic Pictures Releasing in America on September 1, 2012 under the title \"Apocalypse of the Dead\". It has a cult status in some regions and the sequel is in development.\n\nDirected by Roy Frumkes. \"Document of the Dead\" is a 1985 documentary film that takes a look back from Romero's first television commercials onward and it chronicles his career and stylistic techniques.\n\nDirected by . \"Fan of the Dead\" is a 2003 52 minute documentary road-movie revealing the filming locations of \"Night of the Living Dead\", \"Dawn of the Dead\", \"Day of the Dead\" and \"Night of the Living Dead\" remake with exclusive interviews with the cast of the George A. Romero's trilogy.\n\n\"Fan of the Dead\" was released on DVD/Blu-ray in USA/Canada (Cheezy Flicks), France (Bach Films), Italy (Millennium Storm), Germany (CMV Laservision), Spain/Portugal (Manga Films), Great-Britain (Arrow Films) and Australia (Umbrella Entertainment).\n\nAdditional credits: Music by Sebastian Munoz and Antonio Martino; Edited by Olivier Andre.\n\nDirected by Robert Lucas (as Robert L. Lucas) and Chris Roe. \"One for the Fire: The Legacy of 'Night of the Living Dead' \" is a 2008 documentary film made to celebrate the 40th anniversary of George Romero's \"Night of the Living Dead\". It features most of the main people behind the film, as well as a few of the lesser known people who had minor roles in the movie. Romero, John Russo, Russell Streiner, Judith O'Dea and Karl Hardman are among those interviewed.\n\nAdditional credits: Produced by Robert Lucas and Chris Roe; Written by Billy Gram, Robert Lucas and Chris Roe ; Music by Jess Bryden; Cinematography by Robert Lucas; Edited by Michael Felsher.\n\nDirected by Jeff Carney. \"Autopsy of the Dead\" is a 2009 documentary film that examines the living history behind \"Night of the Living Dead\" that has since attained the status of a cultural phenomenon.\n\nAdditional credits: Produced and written by Jeff Carney and James Cirronella; Editing and Cinematography by Jeff Carney.\n\nDirected by Gavin Shaw and Craig Belliveau. \"Cinemall\" is a 2011 short documentary film about the Monroeville Mall, the main location of \"Dawn of the Dead\".\n\nAdditional credits: Produced and cinematography and editing by Gavin Shaw and Craig Belliveau; Written by Gavin Shaw; Music by Carlo Carosi.\n\nDirected by Rob Kuhns. \"Birth of the Living Dead\" focuses on the impact \"Night of the Living Dead\" had on pop culture.\n\nAlthough the majority of the \"Living Dead\" media has been films, related projects have been released in other media.

The Garde would also take in all conscripts on completion of their army service. Napoleon III took up the idea and announced on 12 December 1866 that the \"Garde Mobile\" would eventually attain a strength of 400,000 troops. Its members were colloquially known as \"\"Moblots\"\". It origins lay in the crises that led up to the Franco-Prussian War, when Adolphe Niel, Minister of War for France under Emperor Napoleon III, attempted to bolster French military power creating a service which would provide reserves to be added to the regular French army. Although there was conscription into the army, not only was it not universal but middle-class people could purchase exemptions for their sons in a system known as \"Remplacement\".\n\nBoth the left and the right in the \"Corps Legislatif\" took issue with the proposal. The right wanted an all-professional army; the left were opposed to Bonapartist militarism, or wanted a \"People in Arms\" as their defense service. Hence not much money was spent for the equipment or training of the \"Garde Mobile\". Its authority to conscript was also diminished. Servicemen were trained fourteen days per year, each one not followed by another, so they could return home to sleep. This service was not even permitted to deploy beyond the local areas of which the units were formed; thus, they were hardly \"mobile\". \n\nThe \"Garde Mobile\" had different uniforms from those of either the regular infantry, the National Guard, or the infantry of the French Marines. They did not get the excellent French Chassepot rifle. When the Franco-Prussian War broke out, troops were called up into the Garde Mobile, and they received a mixture of inferior equipment bought from foreign countries, the transport of which was secured by the French Navy.\n"}

{"id": "2177920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2177920", "title": "New York State Route 22", "text": "New York State Route 22\n\nNew York State Route 22 (NY 22) is a north–south state highway that parallels the eastern border of the U.S. state of New York, from the outskirts of New York City to the hamlet of Mooers in Clinton County near the Canadian border. At , it is the state's longest north–south route and the third longest state route overall, after NY 5 and NY 17. Many of the state's major east–west roads intersect with, and often join, NY 22 just before crossing into the neighboring New England states, where U.S. Route 7 (US 7), which originally partially followed NY 22's alignment, similarly parallels the New York state line.\n\nAlmost all of NY 22 is a two-lane rural road through small villages and hamlets. The exceptions are its southern end in the heavily populated Bronx and lower Westchester County, and a section that runs through the city of Plattsburgh near the northern end. The rural landscape that the road passes through varies from horse country and views of the reservoirs of the New York City watershed in the northern suburbs of the city, to dairy farms further upstate in the Taconic and Berkshire mountains, to the undeveloped, heavily forested Adirondack Park along the shores of Lake Champlain. An section from Fort Ann to Keeseville is part of the All-American Road known as the Lakes to Locks Passage.\n\nThe oldest portions of today's NY 22, in Westchester County and along the Lake Champlain shoreline, were Native American trails. Dutch, and after them English, settlers continued to use the road to get their farm products to market, with the southernmost portion eventually becoming the White Plains Post Road in the 18th and 19th centuries. In the early 20th century, as automobile use became widespread, the state paved the more heavily used sections and built new roads to create the current highway, first designated as NY 22 in 1930. In its early years the highway began in Manhattan; until 2008 its northern end was the Canadian border.\n\nNY 22 starts as an urban arterial road, passing through the most populous communities along its route within its first . After running northerly from its origin in the Bronx it veers slightly to the northeast in the vicinity of a traffic circle near Kensico Dam before heading northward for good as a mostly two-lane rural route all the way to the state's North Country.\n\nThe majority of NY 22's routing is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT); however, several sections are maintained by other jurisdictions. The southernmost of these is in the Bronx, where the entirety of the highway within the borough is maintained by the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT). In Westchester County, NY 22 is mostly locally maintained within the city of Mount Vernon and is county-maintained within the city of White Plains. In Clinton County, the route is locally maintained within the city of Plattsburgh.\n\nDuring its course, NY 22 intersects or runs concurrently with 46 other designated routes: one state parkway, five Interstate Highways, and seven U.S. Highways not counting its own termini. Of the surface road intersections, 18 terminate at NY 22 and 15 are concurrencies shared with the crossing routes, accounting for , or 21.5% of the highway's total length.\n\nNY 22 starts as Provost Avenue at an intersection with U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in the Eastchester section of the Bronx, intersecting with East 233rd Street about to the north. It soon crosses the Westchester county line into Mount Vernon and becomes South Third Avenue, beginning a section in that county. Shortly after the county line, NY 22 makes a sharp turn to the east at the South Columbus Avenue intersection, soon passing St. Paul's Church National Historic Site on its north, then curving back to that direction. It parallels the nearby Hutchinson River Parkway as it passes through the suburbs of Bronxville and Tuckahoe. At Wilson Woods Lake, it crosses under a railroad bridge on the Metro-North New Haven Line and becomes North Columbus Avenue, then has its first interchange with a limited-access road at the Cross County Parkway.\n\nCountry clubs on either side bracket NY 22's entry into Eastchester. It makes a turn to the northeast, passing the Vernon Hills Shopping Center to the right. After leaving Eastchester, NY 22 continues north into the village of Scarsdale. Paralleling the Bronx River Parkway (BRP), enters Westchester's county seat, White Plains. NY 22 also intersects NY 125 and NY 119 in downtown White Plains, then bends to the northwest along North Broadway, eventually intersecting the Cross-Westchester Expressway (Interstate 287 or I-287). The White Plains Rural Cemetery is visible to the west as NY 22 continues northward out of the city. In North White Plains, the surrounding area becomes less developed as it goes over a gentle rise from which a short connector runs downhill to the traffic circle where the BRP ends and the Taconic State Parkway begins, just south of Kensico Dam.\n\nWhile the Taconic State Parkway continues along the northwest heading NY 22 had been following, NY 22 itself veers to the northeast along the reservoir's south shore. After crossing a small bridge over one of the reservoir's bays, NY 22 becomes a four-lane divided highway and begins a thousand-foot (() concurrency, the first of 15 along its length, with NY 120. The combined roads pass just west of IBM's Armonk headquarters and the \"Duke's Trees angle\", the westernmost point in Connecticut. For the first time, NY 22 runs parallel to New York's eastern border, intersecting I-684 for the first of several times just north of the short portion of that highway in Connecticut, after which NY 22 reverts to two lanes. A short distance later, NY 433, one of the state's shortest highways, heads south from NY 22 into Greenwich.\n\nAfter that junction, NY 22 bends back to the north, paralleling I-684 as a narrow, shaded meandering two-lane rural route through the Westchester countryside of large wooded lots and houses well-screened from the road. In downtown Bedford, the first settlement since White Plains, the highway overlaps with NY 172 for a mile (1.6 km), its first concurrency with an east-west route, then veers back to the northwest at the center of town. Just to the north, NY 121, the only north–south state highway whose route is entirely east of NY 22, forks off from its southern terminus. Another mile past that, NY 22 returns to a due-north heading, passing the John Jay Homestead State Historic Site a National Historic Landmark, where it turns west briefly, and Harvey School, where it curves to the northwest again. After the Katonah Museum of Art it widens briefly at a major intersection with NY 35. north of that junction, NY 22 becomes parallel with I-684 into the Town of Somers and the hamlet of Goldens Bridge. On the other side of the Interstate, accessible via NY 138, is the Goldens Bridge station on Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line, which begins a long parallel alignment with NY 22 at this point.\nThe railroad's Purdy's station is a short distance west of the next junction, NY 116. At another traffic light to the north, NY 116 goes east to Titicus Reservoir at the northern intersection, the highway crosses under I-684, remaining between it and the railroad tracks. Just past the Interstate, NY 22 turns west onto Hardscrabble Road, which soon turns north again to follow the tracks to the next station, North Salem's hamlet of Croton Falls. Just north of the hamlet, NY 22 crosses under the tracks, and is joined by US 202. Immediately afterward, the road crosses back under the railroad again and enters Putnam County, following the Croton River north past the spillway of East Branch Reservoir.\n\nAfter paralleling the reservoir for almost , a third route, US 6, joins the concurrency just east of the village of Brewster, forming the only three-route overlap along NY 22. The three routes cross under a high, long bridge carrying I-84, then veer east to an interchange with the north end of I-684. US 6 and 202 continue east for Danbury while NY 22 uses the northbound on-ramp of the I-684 roadway. The next thousand feet (300 m) of NY 22, along the brief extension of I-684, is the highway's only expressway section; the roadways merge and narrow to two lanes after they cross the Croton's East Branch.\n\nNY 22 continues heading northeast along a narrow strip of land between the East Branch and Bog Brook reservoirs. It then resumes its northward heading, following a much straighter course than it had up to this point, on two lanes through wooded areas of the town of Patterson, where two local state highways, NY 312 and 164, come in from the west. The highway gradually expands to three and sometimes four lanes as it passes through built-up areas of strip development. Shortly after intersecting a third state highway, NY 311, and passing another strip plaza, NY 22 crosses into Dutchess County.\n\nAfter another supermarket strip to the east, a long, gentle divided bend in the road almost a mile long ends with an overpass where NY 55 comes in from the west. It joins NY 22 as the two routes, returning to two lanes, pass through the eastern fringe of the village of Pawling and then by Trinity-Pawling School. Past the village, the railroad tracks edge closer to the highway as NY 22 enters the scenic Harlem Valley, near the lower end of the Taconic Mountains. The road curves more gently and takes longer straightaways, with lower density of residential and commercial development. from Pawling, the Appalachian Trail crosses the road next to the line's similarly named station.\n\nNY 22 and NY 55 continue their long curve into the town of Dover, past the Harlem Valley–Wingdale station next to the road across from the now-closed buildings of Harlem Valley Psychiatric Center. The NY 55 concurrency ends when that road forks off east towards Connecticut at the hamlet of Wingdale. The road continues through Dover Plains and into Amenia, where an overlap with NY 343 begins. The railroad line ends at Wassaic. NY 343 remains joined with NY 22 into the hamlet of Amenia, where it separates and heads towards Sharon, Connecticut. At the same junction, US 44 comes in from Millbrook to begin an overlap with NY 22. The valley opens up as the southern Taconics loom ahead. Shortly after crossing into the Town of North East, the highway passes by the large Coleman Station Historic District.\n\nAfter intersecting with NY 199 at its eastern end, NY 22 and US 44 veer northeast into the small village of Millerton in the northern protrusion of Dutchess County's Oblong, an area once the subject of a boundary dispute between New York and Connecticut in the late 17th century. US 44 continues eastward towards Lakeville, Connecticut, only a mile (1.6 km) east at this point, while NY 22 resumes its northward course into the shadow of the ridge ahead, where Brace Mountain, Dutchess County's highest peak, dominates the view. At another gentle curve, NY 22 slips into Columbia County and the town of Ancram. North of the county line, Massachusetts becomes the state behind Alander Mountain and the other peaks visible to the east. The southernmost route from New York to the Massachusetts state line, NY 344, leaves for Bashbish Falls State Park just west of the hamlet of Copake Falls.\n\nThe next major junction is at Hillsdale, where NY 23, the longest east–west state highway not to overlap with NY 22, intersects at a traffic light just east of downtown. At Green River, NY 71, the state's shortest two-digit route, begins it short eastward course into Massachusetts. NY 22 then crosses into Austerlitz, where the surrounding terrain becomes much more wooded and the valleys become narrower. In the center of town, the historic hamlet of Old Austerlitz, East Hill Road offers a short detour to Steepletop, the farm where Edna St. Vincent Millay lived, another National Historic Landmark. A short distance later, NY 22 intersects with NY 203 at its eastern end.\n\nNY 22 then veers sharply to the northeast, resuming a northward direction within of the state line, the highway's closest approach to it along its entire length. It then rounds a mountain and heads west, paralleling the New York State Thruway's Berkshire section (I-90) for a mile. NY 980D (an unsigned reference route) leaves to the east, where it becomes Massachusetts Route 102 at the state line. After Thruway exit B3, NY 22 resumes its northerly heading. From here it intersects NY 295, then passes Queechy Lake. NY 22 then straightens out to reach New Lebanon, where it intersects US 20. Ending a stretch with no concurrencies, the longest on NY 22, New York's longest east–west route (US 20) overlaps with its longest north–south route (NY 22) for a mile before the former continues to Pittsfield and the latter returns to the border-paralleling course, which takes it into Rensselaer County.\n\nAs NY 22 continues north, it remains, at first, within a mile of Massachusetts, moving to the east to intersect with NY 43 in Stephentown. North of that junction, it begins to run through a deep, isolated, lightly populated valley in the New York section of the Berkshires. Wide curves take the road through the town of Berlin. NY 22 trends further west, then back east to where NY 2 crosses via an overpass at Petersburgh on its way to Petersburg Pass, the northernmost crossing of the New York–Massachusetts state line. The next road to head east from NY 22, NY 346 at North Petersburgh, enters Vermont.\n\nShortly afterward, the highway descends gently from the Berkshires to meet another major east–west state road, NY 7. After turning northeast to join it at a traffic light, NY 22 overlaps with Route 7 for , then forks off to the north just before crossing the Hoosic River. NY 22 follows the river for to Hoosick Falls, the first village it has passed through since Millerton. There are no other state routes here, but after another , at North Hoosick, NY 67 comes in from the east and the two roads overlap as they leave Rensselaer County.\n\nThe next of NY 22 traverse Washington County, the longest portion of the highway in a single county. Almost immediately after the joined roads cross the line, NY 67 splits off to the west, crossing the Hoosick back into Rensselaer County, while NY 22 straightens out again to go due north. After , it reaches Cambridge, where NY 313 forks off to the east. In the middle of town, NY 372, a local connector to Greenwich, ends.\nNorth of Cambridge, the highway continues through a rolling landscape of fields and farms, the low transitional country between the Appalachians and the Adirondacks. Beyond NY 29's eastern terminus at Greenwich Junction, NY 22 heads eastward again through of countryside until, just before reaching Granville, it comes within of the state line, the closest it has come to that boundary since Austerlitz. At the village's south end, NY 22 intersects NY 149 and the two routes overlap for until Route 149 begins its short journey to Vermont. Just north of Granville, the first of NY 22's two suffixed routes, NY 22A, begins its route running closely parallel to the state line and then into Vermont, where it becomes Vermont Route 22A (VT 22A), paralleling the parent route for some distance on the other side of the state line.\n\nImmediately after this junction, NY 22 begins a long curve away from the state line that has it running due west at the end of NY 40 in North Granville. It heads northwest a little further until, after passing between Great Meadows and Washington state prisons, it reaches US 4 and turns right to join it, resuming its northward course. At this point the highway is from the state line, the farthest west it has gotten from it since southern Westchester County. The overlap with US 4, the first to pair NY 22 with another north–south route since the short concurrency with NY 120, lasts for along the base of the Adirondack foothills between the low country and Lake George, before ending in Whitehall, where US 4 leaves to assume the east–west course it takes across northern New England.\n\nAs NY 22 bends westward after leaving Whitehall, it rounds the north end of the ridge to the west, offering views into Vermont. Once again the Vermont state line is very near NY 22, but now it is separated from New York by water instead of land. The stream at the bottom of this valley, surrounded by the low lying Drowned Lands flood plain, is the inflow for Lake Champlain. The lake's South Bay, which the road crosses immediately after this turn, is also the Blue Line. NY 22 has now entered the Adirondack Park, the Forest Preserve and National Historic Landmark, and the largest publicly protected area in the contiguous United States. Within the park, NY 22 mainly follows the lakeshore, closer to some of its more populated areas.\n\nIt climbs through rock cuts as it meanders north on the narrowing isthmus between Lakes Champlain and George. Near the northern end, it crosses the Essex County line. into the county, it reaches the first settlement along its length within the Adirondack Park, Ticonderoga. The highway skirts the northeastern edge of the village, the site of key battles in both the French and Indian and Revolutionary Wars, as NY 74 comes in from the ferry to the east, the first intersecting state route since Whitehall, ending the longest such break on NY 22 at . The two routes overlap for almost until NY 74 goes straight ahead at the intersection with NY 9N, while NY 22 turns right to join NY 9N, the longest suffixed route in the state, and return to its northbound orientation for the longest of its concurrencies, at .\n\nAt first, NY 22 and NY 9N veer west, away from the lake, but then return to its shoreline to avoid a nearby mountain, just before Crown Point. NY 185, a small connector road, runs from NY 9N and NY 22 along the peninsula to become VT 17. The road remains close to the widening lake for the next , with the tracks of the Delaware and Hudson Railroad, used today by CSX for freight and Amtrak for passenger service between New York and Montreal, sometimes immediately to the east. After passing through Port Henry to Westport, where 9N leaves heading west for Elizabethtown. Beyond that junction, NY 22 again turns inland, going through the easy pass around Split Rock Mountain, going northwest to Wadhams where it turns northeast to Whallonsburg, then north. At Boquet, it makes an abrupt turn to go due east back to the lakeshore and ferry landing at Essex, where it connects to the Charlotte–Essex Ferry via Dock Street, leading to VT F-5 on the opposite side of Lake Champlain.\n\nThe highway again follows the lakeshore to Willsboro, where NY 22 heads to the northwest again, inland, through dense forest, until it heads west and intersects US 9 in the town of Chesterfield, the other major north–south surface route up the state's eastern side. NY 22 and US 9 join together, closely parallel to the Adirondack Northway (I-87), the only other route in the state to directly connect New York City with Canada. The three routes, spread over many miles in the southern part of the state, run through a narrow corridor for until US 9 and NY 22 veer east again toward Keeseville.\n\nHere, NY 9N ends and US 9 and NY 22 separate, ending the last concurrency along the latter. The two will exchange corridors, with US 9 following the lake shore line while NY 22 remains mostly inland. NY 22 enters Clinton County just north of Keeseville, and then leaves Adirondack Park beyond at the Peru town line.\n\nJust south of the hamlet of Peru, the short NY 442 terminates at NY 22. In the hamlet itself, after the Little Au Sable River crossing, NY 22's other suffixed route, NY 22B, branches off further inland. NY 22 continues north of Peru, and returns to the Northway's side again in a mile. After another , it has its first exit on the Northway near the now-closed Plattsburgh Air Force Base. It continues northeastward, crossing the Saranac River into Plattsburgh, the first city and most populous community NY 22 has passed through since White Plains.\nNY 22 runs along South Catherine Street for a few blocks, then divides into one-way couplets for the first time since Westchester County, with northbound traffic moving a block to the east to follow Oak Street, while southbound traffic comes down North Catherine Street. It parallels US 9 for a couple of blocks, intersecting NY 3 (Cornelia Street) just a block west of its eastern terminus at that highway. After Boynton Avenue, the separate streets reunite and turns northwest just before it has its second and final exit with the Northway. Just after the exit, NY 374 begins along the westbound route as NY 22 turns to the north once again.\n\nThe highway follows the railroad tracks into Beekmantown until it bears left at a fork, trending further west to Beekmantown Corners, where another short local road, County Route 58, formerly NY 456, comes to its western end. After crossing into the next town, Chazy, NY 22 bears left again at another fork to drift further to the west. The terrain around the road becomes increasingly wooded, with long unbroken stretches of pine, in the northern portion of the town. This is briefly broken at another western terminus of a short local road, County Route 23, formerly NY 191, in the hamlet of Sciota.\n\nNY 22 continues past Sciota in a fairly straight north-northwesterly course through more woods with small home and farm clearings. Those yield to mostly fields just before the Great Chazy River, after which NY 22 enters the hamlet of Mooers. NY 22 comes to an end upon intersecting US 11.\n\nThe road is celebrated and described in Benjamin Swett's 2007 photographic travelogue, \"Route 22\".\n\nThe road from the modern-day Bronx (then part of Westchester County) through White Plains to Bedford and points north was originally an old Native American path. This path was later used and widened by the first European settlers. During colonial times, the road was known as \"the road to Bedford and Vermont\". Further north, near Lake Champlain, the route now used by NY 22 was used by the St. Francis Indians of Canada as they went south to find warmer fishing areas. The old road was also used heavily during the American Revolution to transport iron south from the mines in the Adirondacks.\n\nOnce White Plains became the county seat of Westchester in 1759, the road between the village and the city of New York (then encompassing only Manhattan) became an important route and was established as the White Plains Post Road. Before 1797, the main road heading to points north and east out of Manhattan went via Kingsbridge along the old Boston Post Road. A new bridge over the Harlem River (the original Harlem Bridge) was opened in 1797, shortening the route out of Manhattan. This also relocated the Boston and White Plains Post roads to a new alignment along Third Avenue and Boston Road. The White Plains Post Road separated from the Boston Post Road in Bronxdale, with the road to Boston heading east and the road to White Plains heading north. The old White Plains Post Road roughly followed the alignment of modern-day \"White Plains Road\", which was laid out in 1863. (The original post road was to the east of the modern-day avenue). The White Plains Post Road continued north through Olinville, Wakefield, and Mount Vernon, where the route shifted east to modern-day White Plains Post Road, going through Bronxville and Scarsdale to White Plains.\n\nThe stretch from Salem to the Vermont border in Granville was part of the old Northern Turnpike, which began in Lansingburgh and went along modern-day NY 40. The Northern Turnpike was chartered on April 1, 1799.\n\nIn 1868, the New York State Legislature formed a commission \"to regulate, grade, widen, gravel, and improve the old White Plains Post Road\", which was amended in 1870 to \"macadamize the road\" between Mount Vernon and White Plains. The post road south of Mount Vernon, which was part of New York City, was later widened between 1902 and 1908.\n\nState highways were first formally defined by the state legislature in 1909 and given numeric designations, although these initial designations were not publicly signed. Portions of modern NY 22 were defined as part of legislative routes 1 and 22. Legislative route 1 went from the New York City line north along the White Plains Post Road to White Plains, then detoured to Harrison (via Westchester Avenue), before proceeding north to Armonk (via modern NY 120). Legislative route 1 continued north along modern NY 22 to Austerlitz, where it then turned northwest to Valatie (via modern NY 203 and NY 980B), then followed US 9 to Albany. Legislative route 22 had two segments. The southern segment began in Troy, following NY 7 to Hoosick, then went north along modern NY 22 up to Putnam Station (south of Ticonderoga).\n\nIn 1924, New York signed several major state roads with route numbers. Most of Legislative Route 1 was designated as NY 22, but with a direct route between White Plains and Armonk. Also, instead of continuing to Valatie, NY 22 initially ended at the NY 23 intersection in Hillsdale. By 1929, the road to Valatie had been improved and NY 22 was extended to US 9, with a length of . The middle section of modern NY 22 was designated in 1924 as NY 24, running for from Stephentown to Comstock. The portion of modern NY 22 north of Whitehall remained unnumbered in 1924 but the next year NY 30, a route assigned in 1924 that linked Mechanicville to Whitehall, was extended north from Whitehall to the Canadian border north of Mooers. In the 1930 renumbering, the NY 24 and NY 30 designations were both reassigned elsewhere. NY 22 was then extended north along their former routes, incorporating newly improved roads between Austerlitz and Stephentown, creating the route that existed until 2008. The segment of old NY 22 between Austerlitz and Valatie was renumbered to NY 203.\n\nIn 1934, at the insistence of the Automobile Club of New York, several numbered routes were extended and signed within New York City, with NY 22 among them. It was extended south from the Mount Vernon line in the Bronx along White Plains Road, then following East 233rd Street to Webster Avenue until Fordham Road (US 1). From there, it continued south along the Grand Concourse (then overlapped with NY 100), crossing into Manhattan via East 149th Street to the 145th Street Bridge. In Manhattan, the NY 22/100 concurrency continued south along Lenox Avenue, 110th Street, Fifth Avenue, 96th Street, and Park Avenue, ending at Houston Street (NY 1A). By 1941, the alignment within Mount Vernon was shifted east to use Columbus Avenue and South 3rd Avenue (current NY 22), continuing its route to New York City via East 233rd Street as before. On January 1, 1970, the NY 22 designation was removed from Manhattan and most of the Bronx, and the short piece remaining in the city was realigned to meet US 1 at NY 22's current southern terminus.\n\nIn the original plan for the U.S. Highway System, as approved by the Bureau of Public Roads in November 1926, US 7 was defined as beginning in New York City and designated on the alignment of NY 22 to Amenia, where it shifted northeast into Sharon, Connecticut, to use old New England Route 4 through Massachusetts and Vermont all the way to the Canadian border. Apparently New York did not approve this plan, and by mid-1927 the official route log published by the American Association of State Highway Officials had relocated the southern end of US 7 to Norwalk, Connecticut.\n\nIn the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the stretch from Ticonderoga to Keeseville now concurrent with NY 9N was designated solely as NY 22. The north end of NY 47 was also located at an intersection with NY 22 in Ticonderoga. At Westport, NY 22 connected to NY 195, an east–west highway leading to Elizabethtown. At the time, Route 9N only extended from there to Keeseville. NY 9N was extended southward to Lake George , supplanting Routes 47 and 195 and becoming concurrent with NY 22 between Ticonderoga and Westport.\n\nNY 8 originally extended eastward from Hague to a ferry across Lake Champlain at Putnam when it was assigned as part of the renumbering. In between the two locations, the route utilized modern NY 9N, Montcalm Street, NY 22, and Wrights Ferry and Wrights roads. It was realigned in the early 1930s to continue east from Ticonderoga on what is now NY 74 to another ferry across the lake. NY 8 was altered again to follow NY 22 north from Ticonderoga to Crown Point, where it turned off the highway onto Bridge Road (now NY 185). Route 8 remained intact along this routing until , when Route 8 was truncated southwestward to NY 9N at Hague.\n\nOver the course of many years, several sections of NY 22 were straightened, realigned to new roads, or both. Some old alignments are still either county-maintained or state-maintained. Several of these are in Dutchess County. In Dover Plains, the southern leg of NY 22's junction with NY 343 is maintained by the state as NY 980G, a reference route. To the north in the town of Amenia, a loop off NY 22 between Wassaic and Amenia is designated as CR 81. Another former routing of NY 22 in the town of Dover exists as CR 6, a loop route between the hamlets of Wingdale and Dover Plains that runs along the west bank of the Ten Mile River. Within the 44/22 concurrency, part of CR 5 (and its short spur 5S), a mile-long (1.6 km) loop west of the highway south of Millerton, is also a former alignment of NY 22.\n\nBefore the construction of I-684, NY 22 continued northeast along Sodom Road north of Brewster on what is now CR 50, a dead-end road maintained by Putnam County. Modern NY 22 joins the I-684 roadway at exit 10 (the northern terminus of I-684) and connects to the surface road on the opposite side of the Croton River via the NY 981B connector. South of Copake Falls, the state also still maintains an old alignment designated as NY 980F. North of Copake Falls, the northern half of the original alignment was designated as an extension of NY 344.\n\nThe segment of NY 22 north of US 11, named Hemmingford Road, was state-maintained until 1988, when ownership and maintenance of that part of the route was transferred to Clinton County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the county and the state of New York. Following the swap, it was co-designated as CR 34 by Clinton County. In 2008, the signed northern terminus of NY 22 was moved to the east end of its overlap with US 11 in Mooers. The official alignment of NY 22 was not changed, however, as the New York State Department of Transportation still considered the Canadian border to be NY 22's northern terminus until 2014.\n\nNY 22 has two suffixed routes, both in the North Country.\n\n\nCounty route systems containing a former alignment\n\n"}

Founded in 1984, as Vellore Engineering College, by G. Viswanathan, the institution offers 20 undergraduate, 34 postgraduate, four integrated and four research programs. It has a second campus in Chennai.\n\nVIT consolidated its disciplines into 15 Schools of Study with the addition of the VIT Law School at its Chennai campus.\n\nVIT implements the Fully Flexible Credit System (FFCS) which gives the students flexibility to make their own time tables by choosing the subjects and the faculties under whose guidance they want to study.\n\nVIT admits bachelor students through its own engineering entrance exam, called the Vellore Institute of Technology Engineering Entrance Examination (VITEEE). It is conducted every year in the month of April and May. The exam has been conducted online since 2013 and in 2018, 212,000 students have registered.\n\nVIT was ranked 801–1000 in the world by the \"Times Higher Education World University Rankings\" of 2019 and 251–300 in Asia. The \"QS World University Rankings\" ranked it 281–290 in Asia in 2019.\n\nThe National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) ranked VIT 32 overall in India in 2019 and 19 among universities.\n\nAmong engineering colleges in India, VIT was ranked 18 by NIRF in 2019 and 13 by \"Outlook India\". \"The Week\" ranked it 22 in 2018 and \"India Today\" ranked VIT 3rd among private engineering colleges in the same year.\n\nThe VIT Business School was ranked 46 among management schools in India by NIRF in 2019 and 51 by \"Outlook India\"s \"Top 100 Management Schools\" of 2017.\n\nThe Vellore campus hosts two annual college fests, Riviera, a sports and cultural fest, and GraVITas, a technological and design fest. The Chennai campus organizes the cultural fest Vibrance and the technical fest technoVIT.\n\nGender discrimination has been a common issue raised in universities across India. VIT allegedly use their restrictive rules and regressive practices to market to conservative parents of Southern India, particularly in their home state of Tamil Nadu and neighboring Andhra Pradesh. These practices include much more restrictive rules on women hostelers, moral policing, shaming by an all-round security force and special committees to look into moral paternalism. Prominent Indian news agency the Hindu reported that often women would find themselves checked at hostel rooms and asked to stop talking on mobile phones and sleep or study. Over time, videos and articles have emerged online about the same. VIT officials, however, maintain that stricter female hostel rules are a necessary safety precaution given the rise in crimes against women. VIT officials have stated that, while they agree that men and women must be treated equally, they have at times been faced by irate parents who have insisted on stricter codes of conduct. Measured steps are being taken to ensure that both genders are treated equally thus allowing all students equal opportunities to access the institute resources. However, there has been little action over the years, in several cases such practices have increased. In 2019, an open letter emerged in a prominent citizen journalist website where a student opened up about her alleged experience in VIT. VIT despite calling itself a progressive educational institution committed to excellence, still ensures strict gender segregation at official events and fests.\nIn October 2013, two female students were suspended after they helped to organize an online opinion survey of female VIT students, focusing on issues of safety and inequality. A VIT professor (Visiting professor from MIT) who supported the students and filed a public petition in their defense, was simultaneously fired. He alleged in an article published in an international news website that university officials harassed him in collaboration with the local police enforcement of Katpadi where his movements were monitored. He alleges that university officials deliberately tried to make him overstay his visa. Less than 10% of the students living in VIT's female hostel took part in the survey, only after knowing that their identity would not be revealed. Of those who did participate, roughly 84% of respondents indicated that they were dissuaded \"from speaking out publicly against VIT’s management decisions\" by \"fear of expulsion, suspension or other academic devastation\". Commenting on the issue, VIT vice president Sekar Viswanathan said: “The students started a campaign based on the misplaced notion that the university discriminates against women, which is not true. They were taken home by their parents”.\nIn 2019, prominent Indian news agency, the Print carried a story which alleged that the government was delaying according the Institute of Eminence status to VIT due to an alleged anti-Modi government stance by its Chancellor and an official Intelligence Bureau report alleging gender discrimination and harassment of students. Such policies and their gradual discovery allegedly has been causing a steady drop in number of applicants to VIT. \nVIT allegedly makes students sign an affidavit which prohibits them from speaking out against university management. The university code of conduct prohibits any form of protest or action within premises or outside which may spoil repute of the institute and prohibits passing out information to any media group without prior permission of university officials. In cases where they have, the management has known to have taken steps against the students which include harassment, academic failure etc. In 2015, Indian stand-up comedian Papa CJ was banned from the campus for taking up issues related to gender discrimination and moral policing during his show at GraVITas. He put up a video about his ban on his Facebook page and tweeted about the same describing his ban and a video recording of his show.\n\nVIT allegedly has been covering up suicides and complaints against its own administration and staff to protect their reputation as an institute of national repute.\nIn December 2019, the Chief Warden of Men's Hostel of VIT, Vellore sent a circular banning the popular online multiplayer game PUBG.

The subdivision and siding are still in use, but have since changed hands and currently belong to the Arizona and California Railroad, a short line serving southeastern California from Rice to Cadiz, California and southwestern Arizona at Parker. It was the starting point of the abandoned Ripley Branch that goes through Blythe to Ripley, California.\n\nTo the east of Rice is the Rice Municipal Airport, which was acquired by the United States Army's 4th Air Support Command in 1942 as a sub-base of Thermal Army Airfield, and was operational by the end of the year. While the airfield's date of construction is unknown, it was not depicted on a 1932 Los Angeles Airways Chart, indicating construction sometime in the ten years between 1932 and 1942. Rice Army Airfield consisted of two intersecting paved 5,000 foot runways and numerous dispersal pads south of the runways. In 1944 the airfield was transferred from Thermal Army Airfield to March Field. Operations at Rice Field were ended by August 1944, and the field was declared surplus on October 31, 1944.\n\nThe desert training area near Rice Army Airfield was at one time considered as the site for the world's first atomic-bomb test (\"Trinity\"), and in fact was the second-choice site. Instead, a site near Alamogordo, New Mexico, was chosen.\n\nRice became noted for its Shoe Tree, originally an underwear tree, a lone tamarisk on a turnout just south of the highway, adjacent to the main entrance to Rice Army Airfield. This hallmark for a trailer-based business that catered to personnel at what is now the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms, customers passing on Highway 62 (also known as Rice Road) to and from the Colorado River would toss a pair of underwear in the tree's branches. After a fire burned most of the tree and all the underwear, the custom changed and the tree's burned husk became a collection point for old shoes. The tree was featured on \"California's Gold\", a PBS program hosted by Huell Howser. The tree burned flush to the ground in 2003 after which a 'shoe garden' replaced it; a fence on which people hang shoes. Also in the immediate area, travelers occasionally stop to spell their names and initials on the nearby Arizona and California Railroad right-of-way with the multi-colored volcanic rock used as track ballast. Hand-assembled graffiti lines the railroad for the entire distance that it parallels Highway 62.\n\nAt some point during the period 1944–48, Rice Army Airfield was renamed Rice Airport and began operations as a public civilian airport, housing a small flight school for missionaries. Between 1952 and 1955, Rice Airport was changed to a private field, and by 1960 it had been abandoned. As of 2007, no standing structures remain and little evidence exists of the airport's former existence.\n\nThere are no standing buildings and no residents in Rice at present. A hand-painted sign on the western outskirts of the town once announced that the townsite was for sale, but that sign has since been removed. The only building which remains in any condition is a demolished service station.\n\nIn 2010, there was filming for the 2011 movie \"Fast Five\" near Rice. It was featured during the train scene in the beginning of the movie.\n\n----\n"}
{"id": "2177948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2177948", "title": "Sport in Singapore", "text": "Sport in Singapore\n\nSingaporeans participate in a wide variety of sports for recreation as well as for competition. Popular sports include football, basketball, cricket, rugby union, swimming, badminton, and cycling. Many public residential areas provide amenities like swimming pools, outdoor spaces (football, basketball courts, running tracks) and indoor sport centres, with facilities for badminton, squash, table tennis, gymnastics, indoor basketball and volleyball, among others.\n\nSince Singapore is an island, Singaporeans also enjoy many water activities including sailing, kayaking and waterskiing. There is also a number of avid recreational scuba divers, a prominent diving spot being the southern island of Pulau Hantu, famous for its coral reefs.\n\nFootball is arguably the most popular spectator sport. Singapore has its own professional football league, known as the Singapore Premier League (formerly the S.League). Launched in 1996, it consists of 10 teams competing against one another. Each team has its own home stadium, which are mostly located in heartland towns. In 1998, 2004, 2007 and 2012, the Singapore national football team were champions in the AFF Championship, the premier football competition in Southeast Asia.\n\nSingapore's athletes have performed well in regional and international competitions, especially in table tennis, badminton, sepak takraw, bowling, sailing, silat, swimming and water polo. To date, Singapore has won a total of one gold, two silver and two bronze Olympic medals. Singapore has also amassed a total of 41 gold, 59 silver and 117 bronze medals at the Asian Games.\n\nFavourite Singaporean sports include outdoor sports, such as soccer, basketball, cricket, swimming, sailing, as well as various indoor sports like table tennis and badminton. Most Singaporeans live in public residential areas with amenities, such as public swimming pools, outdoor basketball courts and indoor sport complexes located in the vicinity. Since Singapore is surrounded by water, water sports, such as sailing, kayaking and water skiing are popular.\n\nSingapore has its own soccer (soccer) league, the S-League, formed in 1994, currently comprisin 12 clubs, including foreign teams. Other foreign clubs are interested in joining. The Singapore Slingers joined the Australian National Basketball League in 2006, which they left in 2008. They are one of the inaugural teams in the ASEAN Basketball League founded in October 2009. Beginning in 2008, Singapore started hosting a round of the Formula One World Championship. The race was staged at the Marina Bay Street Circuit in the Marina Bay area and became the first night race on the F1 calendar and the first street circuit in Asia.\n\nThe Government of Singapore sanctions a variety of sports-based programs for Singapore's education system in addition to normal physical education. The National Physical Fitness Award (NAPFA) was introduced in 1982, a scheme which requires the mandatory participation of all students within primary and secondary education. The scheme gives awards for a variety of physical tests for endurance, cardiovascular fitness and strength, including a medium-distance run of 1.6 or 2.4 kilometres for primary and secondary students respectively, and the results are reflected in each student's report book. As such, although gaining an award is not mandatory, students are often pressured to do so.\n\nIn addition, the government sponsors the Singapore Sports School which opened on 2 April 2004, combining a secondary school curriculum with professional training in each student's preferred sport, in an attempt to nurture future generations of sportsmen and sportswomen. The concept behind the Sports School is that sporting talent should not be compromised when striving for academic excellence.\n\nOn 21 February 2008 the International Olympic Committee announced that Singapore won the bid to host the inaugural 2010 Summer Youth Olympics. Singapore beat Moscow in the final by 53 votes to 44. On 15 September 2010, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports Teo Ser Luck announced that Singapore will start off the Singapore Biennale Games initiative to keep up the Singapore Youth Olympic Games 2010 Legacy, to be held every 2 years, starting from year 2011.\n\nSingapore has also performed well in subsequent editions of the Youth Olympic Games. To date, the country has won a total of 2 gold, 3 silver and 4 bronze medals {cn}. Singapore sent its first 3 winter sport athletes to the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics held in Lausanne, Switzerland .\n\nRugby was introduced to the British colony of Singapore in the late nineteenth century. It has had a steady presence since the beginning of the 20th century, when the Malay Cup between Singapore national rugby union team and Malaya was established, which is one of the oldest rugby competitions in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2005, the Singaporean team won the Asian Netball Championship with a win over the Malaysian team with a score of 53–39 at the Finals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They started performing as a family band in 1977. The Jets were discovered by Don Powell, who previously managed Stevie Wonder and David Bowie, among other artists.\n\nThe group enjoyed worldwide success in 1985–1990, performing three world tours, and producing eight top-10 hits.\n\nThe original band consisted of the eight oldest children of Maikeli \"Mike\" and Vaké Wolfgramm, who were originally from the South Pacific island country of Tonga.

{"id": "2177983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2177983", "title": "Hovsep Pushman", "text": "Hovsep Pushman\n\nHovsep Pushman (; May 9, 1877 – February 13, 1966) was an American artist of Armenian background. He was known for his contemplative still lifes and sensitive portraits of women, often in exotic dress. He was most closely associated during his lifetime with the Grand Central Art Galleries, which represented him from its opening in 1922 until his death in 1966.\n\nHovsep Pushman was born and grew up in the town of Dikranagerd in Asia Minor, where his family, originally \"Pushmanian,\" was in the carpet business. Pushman showed artistic ability early, and at age 11 was the youngest student ever admitted to Istanbul's Imperial School of Fine Arts.\n\nIn 1896, Pushman's family emigrated to Chicago, where he studied Chinese culture, immersing himself in Asian art, and began to teach at the age of 17. He then moved to Paris and studied at the Académie Julian under Jules Joseph Lefebvre, Tony Robert-Fleury and Adolphe Déchenaud. Pushman exhibited his work at the Salon des Artistes Français, where he won medals in 1914 and 1921. Pushman returned to the United States in 1914, and in 1916 moved to Riverside, California, living at the city's Mission Inn until 1919. There he accepted some portrait commissions, including one that still hangs at the inn. In 1918 Pushman and a group of California painters founded the Laguna Beach Art Association; the same year he was awarded the California Art Club's Ackerman Prize.\n\nAfter his time in California Pushman spent several years in Paris. He opened his own studio in 1921 and, with the encouragement of Robert-Fleury, concentrated his efforts on exotic portraits and still lifes of carefully arranged objects he had collected. According to James Cox, former director of the Grand Central Art Galleries, which represented Pushman for much of his life:\n\n[Pushman's] paintings typically featured oriental idols, pottery and glassware, all glowing duskily as if illuminated by candlelight. They were symbolic, spiritual paintings, and were sometimes accompanied by readings, which help explain their allegorical significance. Most important, they were exquisitely beautiful, executed with technical precision.\n\nIn 1923, Pushman returned yet again to the United States and settled in New York City. His connection to the Grand Central Art Galleries began when he befriended Erwin Barrie, who once managed Carson Pirie Scott's art collection. Barrie introduced the artist to Walter Leighton Clark, who was in the process of establishing the Galleries. When Clark secured space in New York City's Grand Central Terminal, Barrie was hired as director and he encouraged Pushman to join the Grand Central Art Galleries. Pushman set up his studio in the Carnegie Hall building, where he created the remarkable works he showed at the Galleries:\n\nErwin Barrie maintained a separate velvet-walled salon for the exclusive use of Pushman. The only illumination allowed on his paintings were specially designed reflector lights attached to the rear of his carefully selected antique frames. The 'Pushman Room' is a legend in the American art world.\nIn 1932, Pushman was honored with a one-man show at the Galleries. Sixteen paintings were on display and all sold the opening day. The prices ranged from $3,500 up to $10,000 (the equivalent of more than $150,000 in 2009). The same year his painting \"The Daughter of the Sheykh\", which had won a silver medal in Paris in 1921, was purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. \nThe winner of the 1936 art drawing at the Grand Central Art Galleries, Walter S. Gifford of AT&T, selected a Pushman still life of a Chinese statuette.\n\nThe 1940s and 1950s brought controversy and change to Pushman's world. In 1940 he sued the New York Graphic Society for reproducing a painting without his permission. While initially the ruling went against the painter, it was eventually reversed; the decision now protects artists' creative works. He had often turned down buyers interested in his work, reportedly once refusing an offer of $6,000 for a small canvas; in 1942 became only the second painter in 117 years to refuse entry into the National Academy. In 1958 the Grand Central Art Galleries, which had been Pushman's home since they opened in 1923, were forced out of the Grand Central Terminal. Eighty-one-year-old Pushman was present at the final reception at the Galleries' Terminal location, which was attended by more than 400 people.\n\nPushman died on February 13, 1966, in New York City. Three months later, Hulia Shaljian Pushman, his widow, followed him.\n\nFor more than two decades after Hovsep Pushman's death his sons, Arsene and Armand, preserved their father's studio intact. All of Pushman's objects, carpets, antiques, and paintings stayed until the last of the family's heirs died around 1990.\n\nPushman's paintings are in the collections of many major museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, the Seattle Art Museum, the San Diego Art Institute, the Houston Art Museum, the Rockford Art Museum, and the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.\n\n"}

Bezirk\"). It is in central Vienna, west of Innere Stadt.\n\nIt borders Neubau and Mariahilf in the east, Meidling and Hietzing in the south, Penzing in the west, and Ottakring in the north. The northern border runs along the Gablenzgasse and eastern border along the Gürtel beltway (Neubaugürtel, Mariahilfer Gürtel and Sechshauser Gürtel). It includes the areas of Rudolfsheim (divided into Braunhirschen, Reindorf and Rustendorf), Fünfhaus and Sechshaus.\n\nThe district area of Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus was, during the Mesozoic Era, near a sea that retreated 70 million years ago and gradually formed an inland sea. After the final retreat of the sea occurred during the Ice Age, large masses of debris formed from glaciers, mainly from the Danube, but also the Vienna River in the Vienna Basin. In the warm phase, the Danube and Vienna River cut into the land and formed gravel terraces, with the older terraces being at increasing distance from the waters. Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus is located in the oldest terrace (Laaerbergterrasse) supported by Laaerberg on Gloriette from the melting of the Turks and hill ranges. In this section, the terrace Wiental lies, which was once covered by the melting to Gloriette. Through the ever-receding water levels, the height sections remained for the current district area.\n\nThe top soil layer in the district territory consists of a thin layer of loess, which is mixed with limestone and sandstone gravel from the Vienna Woods. Among them are layers of river gravel, mainly quartz, coming from the Alps. Below this gravel are the relics of the freshwater sea that a layer of sand, gravel and Tegel deposited. The district area rises from south to north and from east to west. The lowest area of the district territory is located at the intersection of Sechshauser Belt and Ullmannstraße with an elevation of . The highest point is at the crossing Johnstraße and Hütteldorferstraße with an elevation of .\n\nThe Vienna River was, in prehistoric times, several hundred meters (a half-mile) wide, and in the Roman period, it was still a wide river with many islands. Even in the Middle Ages and in modern times, the Vienna River has played a dominant role for centuries. On the one hand, the river and its floods repeatedly caused heavy destruction. On the other hand, the river served many people as a source of income, both by fishing, as well as the use of water for industry or the operation of the many watermills. The largest river branch, Mühlbach, followed along Ullmannstraße and Mollardgasse streets. Even smaller streams, which emptied into the Vienna River, were originally in the district area. Today canalised Hollerbach has established itself as a corridor, receiving the name \"Hollergasse\" lane.\n\nRudolfsheim-Fünfhaus was formed mainly from the communities of Rudolfsheim, Fünfhaus and Sechshaus, which currently are the 3 \"Katastralgemeinden\" sections of the district.\n\nOver time, the district was extended in addition to parts of Gaudenzdorf (between Wienzeile and Diefenbachgasse) and Penzing (between Hollergasse and Winckelmann Street). Sechshaus is located in the southeast between Hollergasse, Sechshauser Straße and Diefenbachgasse. Rudolfsheim is located in the southwest area of the district, Fünfhaus east of it, the origin was in the area Clementinengasse on a path between Gumpendorf and Schmelz. The border between Rudolfsheim and Fünfhaus run along the line Pouthongasse - Schmelzbrücken Ramp - Grenzgasse - Geibelgasse. Originally, Fünfhaus included the area between Mariahilfer Straße, Kenyongasse, and Wimbergergasse Burggasse, but it was released in 1907 on new construction.\nThe former municipalities of Rudolfsheim and Fünfhaus are also divided into different district parts. Rudolfsheim was formed from the municipalities Rustendorf, Braunhirschen and Reindorf, whose centers were south of Mariahilferstraße. The northern part of Fünfhaus, north from Hütteldorferstraße, divided in turn into Schmelz with the University Sports Institute and the Kleingarten area, the adjacent east Nibelungen quarter and the area of Neu-Fünfhaus, which encloses the two regions.\nA breakdown of the district area is also in the census-district official statistics, in which the municipality counts are combined. The seven census-districts in Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus are: Stadthalle, Reithofferplatz, Fünfhaus-Westbahnhof, Sechshaus, Rudolfsheim-Braunhirschen, Rauscherplatz and Schmelz.\nThe developed area of Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus comprises 52.8% (Vienna citywide 33.3%) of the District area. Nearly 81.0% of the developed area is accounted for by residences, bringing the district in the upper part of the Vienna districts. Farmland includes a share of 8.2% of the area. Cultural, religious, sporting or public buildings share 10.6% of the area. Nearly 33.5% of the district is in traffic/transportation areas. This is the third highest value of a municipality of Vienna.\n\nBy contrast, the proportion of grassland in the district is rather small: 12.7%. About half of the green areas are parks, 31.2% attributable to small gardens, with 18.5% as outdoor sports and recreation areas. A final 1.0% is water, i.e. the river bed of the Vienna River.\n\nAfter the second Turkish siege of Vienna, the villages of \"Reindorf\", \"Braunhirschen\", and \"Rustendorf\" arose and were in 1863 combined into the municipality of Rudolfsheim, named after the Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria. In the nineteenth century, the district grew significantly, and in 1890 was incorporated along with nearby communities \"Fünfhaus\" and \"Sechshaus\" into Vienna proper. The northern and eastern parts of \"Fünfhaus\" became the fifteenth district and the area of \"Rudolfsheim\" and \"Sechshaus\" became the fourteenth district under the name of \"Rudolfsheim\" alone. In 1938 \"Rudolfsheim\" and \"Fünfhaus\" were unified into the 15th district, and the 14th district became the part of the 13th district north of the Wien River. Since 1957, the 15th district has been named \"Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus\".\n\nFrom 1871 to 1938, there had been the synagogue on Turner Street, but during the November Pogrom \"Kristallnacht\", it was destroyed, along with 91 other Viennese synagogues. Only the City Temple in the 1st District survived the night unscathed.\n\nIn the 1990s, there were several small changes in district boundaries. In 1992, the boundaries were altered in the area of the Auer-Welsbach Park.\nIn 1995, the district boundaries changed in two sections of the belt,\nand in the field Kendlerstraße, Sporckplatz and Ibsenstraße.\nThe most recent change was marginal in 1996 in the area of Europe square in front of the Western Railway Station.\nThese border changes were not in residential areas, but especially at transport buildings, parks and sports facilities.\n\nIn 1869, the current area covered by the Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus district already included 64,042 inhabitants, and it was similarly densely populated as it is today. Through the continuous influx of people into the area, the population increased until the beginning of World War I, and had doubled by 1910 at the peak of 145,694 people. Afterwards, a permanent population decline occurred, which was mainly due to higher housing claims. After a historic low of 64,895 inhabitants in 2001, the district population trended to re-grow. Only after the turn of the millennium, did the population in Vienna citywide tend to grow. At the beginning of 2007, the population stood at 70,490 people in Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus.\n\nThe age structure of the district population in 2001 was slightly younger than the average across Vienna. The number of children under 15 years was 15.3%, slightly higher than for Vienna citywide (14.7%). The proportion of the population from 15 to 59 years stood at 65.8% (Vienna: 63.6%), with the proportion of people over the age of 60 as 19.0% (Vienna: 21.7%), significantly lower than the city as a whole. The gender distribution in the district area was 48.2% men and 51.8% women.\nThe percentage of married people was 40.6%, compared to 41.2% citywide, slightly below the average of Vienna.\n\nThe proportion of foreign-born district residents in 2006 was 31.8% (Vienna: 19.1%) the highest percentage of all districts of Vienna.\nAs in the rest of the municipality, the share is growing, in 2001 it stood at 29.2%. The highest proportion of foreigners in 2005 representing approximately a 9.6% share of the district population were nationals from Serbia and Montenegro. Another 4.7% were Turkish, 2.5% Polish, 2.3% Croatian, 2.2% Bosnian and 1.1% German citizens. In 2001, nearly 35.2% of the district population was born in Austria. Almost 13.0% stated Serbian as their mother tongue, 8.7% Turkish and 5.4% Croatian.\n\nDue to the high proportion of foreigners, Rudolfsheim- has the lowest percentage (40.2%) of Roman Catholics of all districts of Vienna (Vienna average: 49.2%). There are seven district Roman Catholic parishes, forming the City Deanery 15. The proportion of people belonging to the Muslim and Orthodox faiths was 14.7% and 11.4%, the highest levels in Vienna. The proportion of Protestant residents stood at 3.1%, below the average. Almost 23.3% of the district population in 2001 did not belong to a religious community. Another 7.4% stated they were either not religious at all or had some other religious preference.\n\nThe SPÖ in Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus always enjoyed a strong majority and appointed the district governor throughout the post WW 2 era. The Social Democrats governed the district for a long time, with either an absolute majority of the vote or of district mandataries. In the 1991 election, an ascendant FPÖ was for the first time able to overtake the ÖVP, which had traditionally always been the second largest party in the district with the highest proportion of foreign-born residents. In 1996, the FPÖ scored its best result in any district of Vienna and broke the lock of the SPÖ on an absolute majority mandate. In the 2001 election, however, the FPÖ lost heavily, falling even below its result of 1991. The SPÖ and the Greens benefited from its losses. The SPÖ garnered around 47% of the vote (\"see chart below\"), a result close to an absolute majority. The Greens received 14% of the vote, becoming the third-strongest force in the district, and managed to overtake the ÖVP (as 4th). This trend persisted into 2005. The SPÖ won easily that year getting 49% of the vote; the Greens overtook the FPÖ with about 18% of the vote and became the second-largest party, which traditionally provides the deputy governor of the district. The ÖVP was only the 4th largest party in 2005, as its share of the vote continued to stagnate.\n\nThe coat of arms of Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus consists of the emblems of four once independent municipalities. The top half shows the emblem of the municipality of Rudolfsheim until 1853, which was formed by a merger of the previously independent communities of Rustendorf, Reindorf and Braunhirschen. The blue part of the coat of arms represents Rustendorf with a silver crescent as its symbol. The green section to the right of it represents Reinsdorf. The golden grapevine with two leaves on a green background symbolizes the wine that was once produced there. The middle section of the coat of arms represents the village of Braunhirschen: the brown deer with its mighty antlers once decorated the entrance of an inn which the former village was named after.\n\nThe red section at the bottom represents the former villages of Fünfhaus and Sechshaus. It shows the Archangel Michael in a silver and golden robe, with ostrich feathers mounted to his helmet. Michael holds a golden lance festooned with a cross, which he uses to kill a green fire-breathing dragon. The image is the symbol of the Barnabitenkollegium St. Michael in Vienna, a monastery that was home to the founding fathers of the settlements of Fünfhaus and Sechshaus. As the former crest of Sechshaus was virtually identical to that of Fünfhaus, it is represented by the Fünfhaus section of the coat-of-arms.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2177999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2177999", "title": "Green Line (Lebanon)", "text": "Green Line (Lebanon)\n\nThe Green Line was a line of demarcation in Beirut, Lebanon, during the Lebanese Civil War from 1975 to 1990. It separated the mainly Muslim factions in predominantly Muslim West Beirut from the predominantly Christian East Beirut controlled by the Lebanese Front. However, as the Civil War continued, it also came to separate Sunni from Shia. At the beginning of the Civil War, the division was not absolute as some Muslims lived East of the Green Line and some Christians lived in West Beirut; but, as the Civil War continued, each sector became more homogeneous as minorities left the sector they were in. The appellation refers to the coloration of the foliage that grew because the space was uninhabited. While most commonly referred to as the \"Green Line\", it was also sometimes called the \"Demarcation Line\". It generally stretched from the North of Beirut to the South, and the primary street that followed the Green Line was Damascus Street. There was no formal line or continual security but it was common to see militia checkpoints that people crossing at particular points had to go through and snipers on top of buildings were common. Many of the buildings along the Green Line were severely damaged or destroyed during the war. Since the end of hostilities, however, many of the buildings have been rebuilt within the framework of the urban renewal project of Solidere in \"Centre Ville\".\n\nThe Green Line was a vulnerable point for both West and East Beirut. During Israel's siege of West Beirut, Israeli armed forces surrounded Western Beirut and stationed tanks along the Green Line.\n\nAfter the Syrian military withdrew from East Beirut in August 1982, the Palestine Liberation Army was dispatched to the Green Line under the command of the Syrians. The residents on both sides of the line disapproved of the presence of the Palestine Liberation Army.\n\n"}
{"id": "2178001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2178001", "title": "Jérôme Rothen", "text": "Jérôme Rothen\n\nJérôme René Marcel Rothen (; born 31 March 1978) is a French former footballer who played as a winger.\n\nRothen won 13 caps for the French national team. He represented his country at the 2004 European Football Championship and won the FIFA Confederations Cup with France in 2003. At club level, Rothen won the Coupe de France once and the Coupe de la Ligue twice with Paris Saint-Germain. He also won the Coupe de la Ligue with Monaco. Rothen was a skilled winger who specialised in free kicks, crossing and passing.\n\nRothen underwent training at the famous Clairefontaine National Football Academy in France.\n\nHe started his career with SM Caen.\n\nHe then played for Troyes AC under Alain Perrin.\n\nHe was brought to AS Monaco on 1 January 2002 for €5 million. Rothen was one of the players of the Monaco side that reached the 2004 final of the Champions League, in May 2004.\n\nA native of the Paris metropolitan area, he fulfilled a childhood dream when he signed for the capital side Paris Saint-Germain in 2004 for €11 million. He rejected lucrative offers from more powerful European clubs such as Manchester United, Chelsea F.C. and Valencia C.F. in order to join PSG, the club he supported during his youth.\n\nIn the French capital, his dream soon turned sour. Often injured, Rothen appeared in only 18 league games and 2 Champions League fixtures in his debut season. 2005-06 was equally disappointing. Under the orders of Laurent Fournier and then Guy Lacombe, the left winger struggled to reproduce the kind of displays that had made him famous at Monaco. Often injured, he nonetheless took part in a Coupe de France win over fierce rivals Olympique de Marseille.\n\nIn the second half of 2006, returning from injury, Rothen found himself cast aside by Guy Lacombe. In December 2006, he faked an injury in order to organize a transfer deal that would materialize during the January transfer window. He was then tipped to join Lille OSC, but then learned about Lacombe's imminent sacking from Paris Saint-Germain. The arrival of new coach Paul Le Guen in January 2007 convinced him to stay put. Gradually, he began to recover his best form. With the club battling against relegation, Rothen's revival was one of the factors that enabled PSG to save their spot in the top flight.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, several clubs expressed interest for the midfielder, including champions Olympique Lyonnais, who were looking for a replacement for the outgoing Florent Malouda. Rothen stayed in Paris, and following a great start to the 2007-08 season, was voted as the league's player of the month in September. He regained a spot in the French national football team and even netted a free-kick on 13 October 2007 against the Faroe Islands.\n\nIn 2007-08, Paris Saint-Germain struggled even more than the previous season. In such a context, Rothen became an increasingly important player due to his creativity and crossing ability. Such was his importance to the club that French media would describe PSG as \"dependent upon Rothen\" and \"playing a game that is excessively left-sided\", the flank which the player occupied. During those years, several signings like Sergey Semak, Bonaventure Kalou and Williamis Souza were made with the aim of reducing the side's dependence on Rothen and introduce some kind of creative threat on the right flank too. None of these solutions worked, and PSG continued to rely upon Rothen to pull them out of the relegation trap in May 2008.\n\n2008-09 was his last season in Paris. He managed to make 34 league appearances, his best tally in a single season since 2003-04 in Monaco at AS Monaco. However, he had lost much of his importance to the club, with the arrival of other creative players such as Stéphane Sessègnon and former Monaco team mate Ludovic Giuly. In the summer of 2009, Paul Le Guen left the club to be replaced by Antoine Kombouaré, who deemed Rothen surplus to requirements and banished him to the reserves squad.\n\nOn 1 September 2009 Rothen agreed to join Scottish Premier League club Rangers on a one-year loan deal from PSG. He made his debut for the club on 12 September 2009 against Motherwell. He made his first appearance in the Champions league for Rangers in their 1–1 draw away to Stuttgart.\n\nAfter going back to France Rothen's relationship with Rangers soured and the club were looking to move Rothen on, as he was deemed surplus to requirements, rather than pay his salary for the remainder of the season when it looked like he would not figure in the squad.\n\nRothen flew to Turkey on 22 January 2010 to sign a six-month loan deal with Ankaragücü after rejecting advances from Greek sides Larissa, Kavala and Iraklis. On 29 January 2010, he signed a six-month contract with Ankaragücü.\n\nAlmost a year after Paris resigned his contract, Rothen signed in May 2011 a two-year contract with the Corsican club of SC Bastia, newly promoted to the French Ligue 2. Rothen made his team debut on 29 July 2011 against Istres, and Bastia won the match 3–1. He won the Ligue 2 title with the team in the 2011-12 season and was selected as the Ligue 2 Player of the Year.\n\nIn July 2013, Rothen rejoined his first senior club, SM Caen.\n\nRothen made his debut on 29 March 2003 against Malta.\n\nHe was a member of the French national squad at Euro 2004, where he made a brief substitute appearance in their defeat by Greece in the quarter-finals. Rothen was not selected in the 2006 FIFA World Cup squad for France. He was recalled to the squad for Euro 2008 qualifying and, on 10 October 2007, marked his comeback with a superbly taken free-kick against the Faroe Islands, the last ever scored free-kick for France as to 13 June 2015.\n\nOn 8 October 2008, Rothen published his autobiography \"You're Not Going To Believe Me\". The book has generated significant attention in the media, notably for its description of an incident concerning Zinedine Zidane, his former teammate in the France national team.\n\nAccording to Rothen, the incident occurred during the second leg of Monaco's 2004 Champions League quarter-final win over Real Madrid. Monaco had overturned a 4–2 first leg deficit, and were 3–1 up with seconds left to play when Zidane tackled Rothen from behind. \"It was a foul and I went down, admittedly I made a bit more of it, but anyone would have done the same, as we were trying to buy some seconds,\" Rothen wrote. \"Zidane leant over me and said: 'Get up, you son of a bitch.'\"\n\nThe expression Rothen claims Zidane used, 'fils de pute', is a variation on what Marco Materazzi is alleged to have said to Zidane before the head-butt that proved the iconic moment of the 2006 World Cup final. \"I was surprised but put it down to his frustration, and I expected him to apologise at the end of the game, but he said nothing,\" Rothen continued. \"I thought the next time we saw each other with the France team he would say sorry, and then it would be forgotten, but he didn't and that disappointed me.\"\nIn a subsequent interview with the French newspaper \"L'Equipe\", Rothen stated he did not intend to smear Zidane's image by publicizing the incident. He also denies having received pressure from the latter's camp to remove the offending passage, as had been reported in the press.\n\nTroyes\n\nMonaco\n\nParis Saint-Germain\n\nBastia\n\nFrance\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2178005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2178005", "title": "Camouflage (band)", "text": "Camouflage (band)\n\nCamouflage is a German synth-pop trio consisting of lead singer Marcus Meyn (b. May 2, 1966), Heiko Maile and Oliver Kreyssig. Their only \"Billboard\" Hot 100 hit was \"The Great Commandment\", which earned No. 59 place in 1988, and earned three weeks at No. 1 on the US dance chart. They also had two additional minor dance hits in 1989. \n\nIn 1983, Heiko Maile, Marcus Meyn, Oliver Kreyssig, and Martin Kähling, four friends from Bietigheim-Bissingen, Germany, formed the band Licensed Technology. It was short lived, as Martin Kähling left in 1984. Soon after, the remaining three members renamed themselves \"Camouflage\", inspired by a Yellow Magic Orchestra song of the same name. The three young musicians set up their first studio in the basement of Heiko's parents' house, calling it \"Boy's Factory\". Their first live gigs at local music clubs soon followed. In 1985, Camouflage recorded two demo tapes at their studio, and the following year, the group won a local radio music contest, after a friend of theirs handed one of the demos in. A small Frankfurt music label, \"Westside\", showed interest in taking Camouflage on. There, the song \"The Great Commandment\" was recorded to be presented to bigger music companies. After considering offers from several record companies, Camouflage decided to sign a contract with Metronome.\n\nWorking with Axel Henninger, Camouflage re-recorded \"The Great Commandment\" in Axel's studio in 1987. The single was released in September of that year and rose to number 14 in the German charts. Their follow-up single \"Strangers' Thoughts\" was released in February 1988, rising to number 20. In March, \"Voices & Images\", Camouflage's debut album, was released. The album topped the US Billboard Dance Charts twice having been played often by small independent radio stations. In New York, Heiko, Oli and Marcus signed a contract with the US label Atlantic that same year, releasing \"Voices & Images\" and the single \"That Smiling Face\" for the US market in the fall of 1988. In an old factory loft near their hometown, Heiko, Oli and Marcus set up \"Boy's Factory 2\", their new studio.\n\nWith producer Dan Lacksman of Telex, the band recorded a new album \"Methods of Silence\" at Synsound Studio in Brussels that following year. Now left to experiment more freely after the commercial success of their first album, Dan's recording work revealed an interesting mix of digital high-tech and out-dated studio equipment. Single \"Love is a Shield\" (position 9 in German charts) stayed in the charts for over six months, and the album reached 13. After follow-up single \"One Fine Day\", the band embarked on their first live concert tour to great financial success. At the beginning of 1990, Oliver Kreyssig left the band for personal reasons.\n\nIn October, Heiko and Marcus began work on the third album \"Meanwhile\" at the Black Barn Studio in England with producer Colin Thursten (who worked with Duran Duran, David Bowie and Talk Talk). Taking a different path, this album included real drums and conventional musical instruments played by guest musicians. The first single \"Heaven (I Want You)\" was released in Germany and USA, reaching 57 in their home country. Three months after their second German tour commenced, they released the album's second single, the double-A sided \"This Day/Handsome.\"\n\nIn a 1995 interview, Marcus said \"Naturally we would have preferred that things had gone differently. But it was our wish at the time to make this type of record. For that reason the situation was perfectly OK for us. Looking back today, we would have liked to have had better advice at the time, recommending against this drastic stylistic change in our music. But things went the way they did...\"\n\nAfter relocating to Hamburg in 1992, the duo founded their own music publishing company and studio, which saw the release of side project \"Areu Areu\". During this time, they also began recording work for their fourth album. The goal with this album was to incorporate as many electronic influences as possible into their work. Their 1993 lead single \"Suspicious Love\" received radio air time and got rotation play on MTV, although it made only a minor chart placement. For this, the band faulted its record company Metronome for eschewing the band over other clients such as Ace of Base. As a result, \"Bodega Bohemia\" and the follow-on singles \"Close (We Stroke the Flames)\" and \"Jealousy\" were only released in Germany.\n\nThe next few years were not happy ones for the band. Heiko and Marcus signed a contract with the organizer of an opera project via mutual friends, but after investing more than a half year, visual concepts and demo recordings to the project, legal disputes between shareholders and organizers prevented any performance from taking place, and ensuing frustrations led the duo to consider leaving the music business entirely.\n\nThe manager of the band \"Die Fantastischen Vier\", Andreas \"Bär\" Läsker, signalled a desire to work with the band and helped them secure a recording contract with BMG (Germany) in 1994 for a fifth album. As the new contract allowed complete freedom of production, Heiko and Marcus revised music they had written for the failed opera project and added experimental and more creative approaches to the new tracks, including writing music inspired by science fiction films. However, the new album \"Spice Crackers\", preceded by the single \"Bad News\" and chased by the single \"X-Ray\" was not a commercial success. The duo temporarily went separate ways to collaborate on various musical projects such as 1996's various artist compilation CD \"Treasury\" in which Camouflage contributed the song \"Winter\".\n\nIn 1997, Sony Music and Polydor released a compilation of past hits called \"\" and a limited edition maxi single with previously released mixes of \"Suspicious Love\", \"Handsome\", and \"Love is a Shield\", albeit without input from Heiko and Marcus. However, this promising new contract ended without further releases for reasons not revealed. One good thing did come of this, however. Former band member Oliver Kreyssig, who had remained good friends with Heiko and Marcus, was by this time working with Polydor and helped with the artwork design of the album and single. This was his first professional involvement with the band since his departure, and ended with him rejoining the band as a member in 1999.\n\nNow a trio again, the band began work on a sixth studio album, beginning with the single \"Thief\". Although it climbed for two weeks in Germany, the band members continued on with their various side projects. In June 2000 Camouflage played their first live gig in many years in Freiburg.\n\nIn 2001 Polydor (which had bought the band's former label Metronome) released the compilation best-of album \"Rewind\", for which Camouflage was finally allowed sufficient opportunity for input and song selection ideas. The limited version DVD included all of the video clips from the Metronome and BMG phases of the band's career. That year Polydor also released the single \"You Were There\" from dance project \"Resistance D\" featuring the vocals of Marcus. Its sound was much like that of Camouflage and subsequently caused a significant amount of confusion with fans.\n\nCamouflage had by this time signed a new contract with Virgin Records and was still tentatively working on a sixth album. However, the band determined that in order to justify the release of an album they had to have at least one successful new single to precede it. At the suggestion of Virgin, the band attempted a comeback attempt with the release of a new version of their classic song \"The Great Commandment\". To avoid rights violations with their previous record company, vocals were also re-recorded. TGC, version 2.0 was produced by the London trio \"Toy\" with drums by Christian Eigner (who had previously toured with various electronics bands. TGC 2.0 climbed the charts for three weeks, but only reached No. 85. The disappointing result left little hope for a release of a sixth album with Virgin.\n\nBecause of this, the band decided to pursue other options with Polydor, culminating in the long delayed \"Sensor\" in 2003 – a long path from the 1999 single \"Thief\" until now. \"Sensor\" was produced by Rob Kirawn and Toy in London and Gerret Frerichs in Hamburg. While there wasn't a plan for how \"Sensor\" was intended to sound, they felt it was important to emphasize classic Camouflage songwriting strengths and return to an electronic presentation. The first single \"Me and You\" reached No. 53 in the German charts, while the album crested at No. 26. The \"Sensor\" tour took the band across Germany and for first time to Russia and other countries and to İstanbul, Turkey. The single \"I Can't Feel You\" only charted at No. 75. Meanwhile, Polydor underwent restructuring in the face of a declining recording industry and once again plans were shelved for additional singles or albums. Nevertheless, the band continued writing new songs.\n\nIn 2004, Camouflage signed a new contract with SPV and Heiko moved to Berlin to begin work on a new album with Oli and Marcus with Heiko taking on production responsibilities, resulting in the band's seventh studio album \"Relocated\" in 2006. Three singles were released from the album \"Motif Sky\", \"Something Wrong\" and \"The Pleasure Remains\", this last title only in Poland. The tour saw the band for the first time playing in South America and Mexico.\n\nIn 2007, Polydor released \"Archive#1 (Rare Tracks)\", a new Camouflage compilation of rare tracks and remixes on two discs.\n\nIn February 2014 Camouflage released a boxset \"The Box 1983–2013\", celebrating their 30 years together. The box contains remastered versions of all seven Camouflage studio albums, the Areu Areu EP, and two new Archive discs of live and demo recordings. The boxset is individually numbered, signed, and limited to 1000 copies. The band also celebrated their 30th anniversary at a live event in Dresden on 8 February 2014. There was a special exhibition before and after this live event where fans had the chance the view and photograph many materials, belongings, studio stuff from the beginning up to then.\n\nCamouflage's eighth studio album \"Greyscale\" was due for release on 12 September 2014, with the single \"Shine\" due to be released shortly before the album. A tour to promote the album was also to begin in January 2015. \"Shine\", and another new song \"Misery\", were debuted during a live performance in 2011. Delays in the production of the album caused the release date to be postponed to 13 February 2015. The tour has also been postponed to March 2015.\n\nOn 19 December 2014, details were released for the new album, which was due for release on 6 March 2015 in Germany and on 27 March for other countries. \"Greyscale\"'s lead single \"Shine\" was released on 20 February 2015. The album features a duet with Wolfsheim vocalist Peter Heppner, called \"Count On Me\" which was to be released as a second single on 9 October 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Two sessions of Marrowstone in the City (MITC) are held in suburbs that surround Seattle, and serve over 330 younger players.\n\nSYSO works with local schools through the Endangered Instruments Program, started by Walter Cole, a project that exposes middle school students to less commonly played instruments like the oboe, bassoon, viola, double bass and French horn. The first of its kind in the United States, the program has been emulated in many other places, including New York City, Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Vancouver, B.C. EIP partners with 13 Seattle-area public schools to serve over 170 students a year.\n\nThrough all of its programs, Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestras serves over 1,100 young musicians each year. Its concerts reach over 14,000, and are replayed over KING-FM to audiences in excess of 200,000.\n\nIn November 2008, the Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestras received a grant of $500,000 from the Wallace foundation.\nThe Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestra, the organization's oldest orchestra, was founded by the Music and Art Foundation in 1942, and its first conductor was Francis Aranyi. He was an internationally famous violinist who performed with many of the greatest orchestras in Europe, and knew such leading composers as Béla Bartók and Arnold Schoenberg. In 1941 Aranyi came to Seattle as concertmaster of the Seattle Symphony, a position he retained for one season. Although his arrival was concurrent with the hiring of Sir Thomas Beecham as conductor, Aranyi was hired separately and was not chosen for the position by the conductor. During Aranyi's direction of the Youth Symphony, he built up the group to an orchestra that was nationally recognized. Following establishment of the Little Symphony (now the Seattle Debut Symphony) in 1946, this training orchestra was advertised as \"a reserve group for promotion to the major Youth Symphony,\" and traced its roots to a Preparatory Ensemble which had been established in 1943. The Little Symphony presented its first public concert on June 7, 1947. Thomas Rodrique became its conductor in 1950. Francis Aranyi and Thomas Rodrique were the musical staff of the Youth Symphony Orchestra for the Pacific Northwest, as the organization was then called, until 1959.\n\nFor its first two years, it was called the Youth Symphony Orchestra of Seattle. From 1944 to 1963, it was the Youth Symphony Orchestra of the Pacific Northwest. Vilem Sokol led the orchestra for 28 years (1960-1988), and it was under him that the YSO became the fourth orchestra in the United States to perform Gustav Mahler's Tenth Symphony. After the London Symphony Orchestra gave its premiere, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and the San Francisco Symphony had been the only orchestras in the world to have performed the work. Under conductor Sokol, the Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestra made two recordings of Mahler's Tenth Symphony in its entirety.\n\nAfter Sokol's departure in 1988, the symphony was led by conductors Ruben Gurevich (1988–93) and Jonathan Shames (1994-2001).\n\nSYSO's Music Director was Dr. Stephen Rogers Radcliffe from 2006 to 2018. In 2019, Juan Felipe Molano became conductor.\n"}

His music, two compositions in all, appears in a position of prominence in the Old Hall Manuscript.\n\nMusicologists have not been able to agree on which English monarch wrote the two mass movements which appear, at the head of their respective sections, in the Old Hall Manuscript. Henry IV, who reigned from 1399 to 1413, was in his early forties when the music was most likely written, since stylistic evidence places it around 1410. However, by 1410 Henry IV was suffering from a disfiguring disease and struggling to maintain his regal power. Therefore, it is unlikely that he, albeit a talented musician, could be the composer of the two pieces. Whereas Henry V, despite being extremely 'busy on campaigns' after his succession, was recorded to never have ceased in his fondness for music. In 1420 the Pell Rolls recorded payments for two new harps to be shipped to the King in France. And the King even went so far as to take his chapel to the Agincourt campaign. This, as well as being substantial evidence for his piety, suggests that the latter is the composer.\n\nHenry V, who reigned from 1413 to 1422, was known to have cultivated music in his youth. Payment for a harp along with 'swords and books on Latin verses' for the young lord Henry was recorded when he was merely six years old. An early biography of Henry V states:\n\n…he was in his youth a diligent follower of idle practices, much given to instruments of music, and fired with the torches of Venus herself.\nRecent research has shown that work on the Old Hall Manuscript probably ceased on the death of Thomas, Duke of Clarence, in 1421. And the last piece of music in the Manuscript was doubtlessly written for the wedding of Henry and Catherine. Since Thomas was King Henry V's brother, and his chapel's musicians are now known to have included Leonel Power, and the manuscript itself passed to Henry V's chapel on the death of Thomas, and the composers included some members of the King's Royal Chapel, most notably John Dunstable. Obviously the manuscript could not have been passed to the long-dead Henry IV at this time, yet this is not a conclusive argument. But it is worth noting that Henry V's extraordinary piety - outdoing even his father in matters of religion - is consistent with the composition of sacred music, and we can be sure of his musical education. It is impossible to say for certain which man was the composer without further evidence.\n\nRoy Henry's music consists of two movements of the ordinary of the mass: a Gloria and a Sanctus, both for three voices, and written in a fairly low register. The music itself is skillfully written, and unusually for the time, no specific plainchant can be identified as a source; both pieces may be freely composed, or the underlying chant may be part of the enormous lost repertory of music from the early 15th century, hence unidentifiable (the vast majority of manuscripts of the time were destroyed in the 1530s during Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries).\n\n"}

Trias (March 18, 1923 – July 11, 1989) was an American karate pioneer, founding the first karate school in the mainland United States and becoming one of the first known American black belts. He also developed Shuri-ryū karate, an eclectic style with roots in Chinese kung-fu, and indirectly some Okinawan karate.\n\nTrias was employed by Southern Pacific Company as a boilermaker apprentice from 1937–39 and a boilermaker from 1939-42.\n\nWhile serving in the United States Naval Reserve as a Metalsmith First Class (M1c) during World War II, Robert Trias was stationed on or around Tulagi in the Solomon Islands from June 1944 to November 1945, and was a Navy champion middleweight boxer. There he met Tung Gee Hsiang, a Chinese missionary of Chan (Zen) Buddhism. Hsiang often watched Trias work out and imitated his boxing footwork, and he asked to practice with Trias. Trias refused because Hsiang was \"just a tiny little guy,\" but Hsiang was persistent and at last Trias agreed to spar with him. Hsiang gave Trias \"the biggest thrashing of his life\" and Trias then asked Hsiang to instruct him in the martial arts.\n\nHsiang taught Trias some xingyiquan as well as some Okinawan Shuri-Te karate, which Hsiang had learned from Choki Motobu in Okinawa. Later, Trias studied with Hoy Yuan Ping whose lineage was from the Teshin Shinjo School of Kempo Jujutsu in Japan. Trias also held a 6th dan black belt in Kodokan Judo, and studied under Yaju Yamada. Trias was also mentored by Yasuhiro Konishi and Makoto Gima.\n\nIn late 1945, shortly before Trias left the Navy in January of the following year, he began teaching martial arts in his backyard. He later opened the first public karate school operated by a Caucasian in the United States mainland in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1946. Trias served as an officer of the Arizona State Highway Patrol from 1946-1961 utilizing his self-defense knowledge on duty and teaching his fellow officers. In 1948 he founded the United States Karate Association (USKA), the first karate organization on the American mainland. Jointly with John Keehan, Trias hosted the first national karate tournament in the United States, called the 1st World Karate Tournament, at the University of Chicago Fieldhouse in 1963 in Chicago, IL. This event was retitled the USKA Nationals in 1966 and the USKA Grand Nationals in 1968. His rules for tournament competition are still used today with only slight variation.\n\nTrias' style was once dubbed, by Trias himself, as Shuri Karate Kenpo, Goju-Shorei-Ryu, and Shorei-Goju ryu though there is no relationship or direct ancestry to the Goju-Ryu currently practiced in Okinawa or the original form of Shorei-ryu once practiced by the Okinawans. His style is now referred to as Shuri-ryu to imply roots to traditional karate though his style is much different from any martial art originating from the Okinawan islands. It has much more Chinese influence and overtones than Okinawan. The naming of his style was as eclectic as the style itself. A few US organizations claim to trace their roots to him and the USKA, including the United States Karate-Do Kai, Professional Karate Commission, United States Karate Alliance, International Shuri-Ryu Association, and Kondo No Shokai.\n\nRobert Trias was responsible for the following developments in karate in United States:\n\nTrias authored \"Karate is my Life\" (1963), \"The Hand is my Sword\" (1974), \"The Pinnacle of Karate\" (1980), \"The Supreme Way\" (1983), and \"Render Yourself Empty\" (1984).\n\nTrias was the recipient of the 1989 Black Belt Hall of Fame Honorary Award.\n\nTrias died from a stent of reoccurring illnesses. Including a number of infections and stage 2 cancer complications exaggerated by an unspecified preexisting condition on July 11, 1989, leaving multiple branches of the Shuri ryu system. Most of the highest ranks and Chief Instructors followed Robert Bowles in the formation of the International Shuri-ryu Association\n\n"}

{"id": "2178052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2178052", "title": "12 Metre", "text": "12 Metre\n\nThe 12 Metre class is a rating class for racing sailboats that are designed to the International rule. It enables fair competition between boats that rate in the class whilst retaining the freedom to experiment with the details of their designs. The designation \"12 Metre\" does not refer to any single measurement on the boat, and is not referencing the vessels overall length, rather, measures the sum of the components directed by the formula which governs design and construction parameters. Typically 12 Metre class boats range from 65 to 75 feet (about 20 to 23 m) in length overall; they are most often sloop-rigged, with masts roughly 85 feet (26 m) tall.\n\nThe first 12 Metres were built in 1907. The 12 Metre class was used in the Olympic Games of 1908, 1912 and 1920 but few boats participated in these events. The 12 Metre class boats are best known as the boat design used in the America's Cup from 1958 to 1987.\n\nCompetitiveness between boats in the class is maintained by requiring the boats to be in compliance with the 12 Metre formula. Designers and builders are required to take into account such things as the sail area, the boat length at the waterline and the boat girth (the measurement around the boat from one sideboard, under the keel, and then over the top on the opposite side back to the original side). The measurements are then weighted in the formula. For example, the present formula takes the square root of the sail area rather than total area. The combination of weighted measurements must be less than or equal to 12 metres. Designers are free to change any of the component variables, as well as other details, such as the size of the rudder and keel, so long as the corresponding changes elsewhere produce an ultimate sum of 12 metres and the resulting boat is both seaworthy and safe. Though disparity between boats are minimized by the rule, enough variation exists so that races are as much about design and construction as they are about seamanship and tactics.\n\nThe Formula and associated rules for designing and constructing 12 Metre yachts has been modified several times from inception in racing.\n\nThe purpose of the Formula and rules was to encourage designer's creativity to optimize designs to get the best overall performance when racing while still maintaining competitive racing postures between different designs. Although the Formula and Rules allowed for some creativity they were also intended to be comprehensive enough to eliminate loop holes which could result in an extreme design which conformed to the 12 Metre rule but completely outclassed other contemporary designs on the race course. If the rules were considered to be too loose then it would discourage the building of new 12 Metre yachts for fear of a new boat being outclassed even before it was launched.\n\nThe Rules were typically updated in response to advances in areas such as material technology (e.g. metal masts versus wooden masts), design technology (e.g. use of the wind tunnel to design sails and sail/mast combinations, advances in fluid dynamics), and equipment (e.g. winch technology).\n\nThe Rule has four distinct periods:\n\nUsed from 1907–1920\n\nwhere\n\nUsed from 1920–1933.\n\nwhere\n\nUsed from 1933 onwards:\n\nwhere\n\nAssociated with the formula is an extremely comprehensive set of rules, which can be classified into two main areas: safety, and ensuring competitive racing. For example, the maximum total area of all cockpits is specified to minimise the chance of a boat being swamped in rougher seas. Structural requirements are specified to ensure that strength is not sacrificed by the need to get weight low down in the keel. Materials are specified plus numerous other details concerning all aspects of the boat. The intention is to challenge designers but ensure competitive racing.\n\nThe America's Cup racing resumed in 1958 after World War II by a syndicate led by Henry Sears, more economical vessels were desired to replace the huge and expensive J-class yachts that were raced in the 1930s; the 12 Metre class was selected.\n\nIn September 1956, a Royal Yacht Squadron syndicate was formed to build a 12 Metre for the 1958 America's Cup. The UK challenger was selected based on model tank testing and David Boyd's second design was chosen. \"Sceptre\" was launched at the yard of Alexander Robertson and Sons Ltd on 2 April 1958, but lost to the New York Yacht Club yacht \"Columbia\" in September 1958. \"Sceptre\" is currently owned and raced by the Sceptre Preservation Society. Alexander Robertson and Sons Ltd also built two of the earliest 12-Metres: \"Heatherbell\" (designer Thomas Glen-Coats, 1907), which represented Finland in the 1912 Summer Olympics; \"Cyra\" (designer Alfred Mylne, 1909).\n\nIn 1987, use of the 12 Metre class was ended, switching to International America's Cup Class boats for the 1992 competition.\n\n12 Metre yachts were used for the last time in America's Cup competition at the 1987 event held in Fremantle, Australia. 12 Metres continued to race together on a local basis but due to the high cost and without the impetus and prestige surrounding competition in the America’s Cup, no new boats have been built since 1987.\n\nThe latter part of the 20th century saw a big revival in interest in classic yachts including 12 Metre yachts and particularly those of wooden construction. There was an increasing number of prestigious regattas in attractive locations such as the Mediterranean and the Caribbean. Also, a more prosperous global economy prevailed and the result was an increasing number of restorations and racing of older 'classic' 12 Metres.\n\nPotential restorers of older boats who wanted to race were potentially faced with a dilemma of whether to restore a boat to its original specification or make modifications to make an older design competitive with a newer design. For example, a yacht designed under the First International Rule would have a wooden mast, gaff rig, and sails made of cotton; whereas yachts designed under the Third International Rule, such as \"Vim\", had a metal mast, Bermuda rig, and sails made from Dacron.\n\nTo encourage participation in racing and also engage the restoration process which remained true to the spirit of the original design, the 12 Metre class association introduced a handicapping system to allow 12 Metres of all ages to race together on a more equal footing. The basis is a handicap applied to each boat according to the 'era' of its design to encourage owners to restore older boats and participate in exciting and sociable racing.\n\nA 12 Metre is classified as belonging to one of three periods. Each Period is defined as a range of dates which coincided with a particular type of keel or rudder design becoming widespread.\n\n\nIn addition to design there are other factors which affect racing results. There are other 12 Metre designs which are fast boats but struggled to reach their full potential due to inadequate crewing or lack of preparation or bad luck or a combination of both.\nIn the America's Cup era it will always be a matter of debate but \"Vim\", \"Intrepid\", \"Courageous\", \"Australia II\", and \"Stars and Stripes 87\" are generally considered to be the best 12 Metres in terms of design excellence and performance on the race course.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2178091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2178091", "title": "Folliculogenesis", "text": "Folliculogenesis\n\nIn biology, folliculogenesis is the maturation of the ovarian follicle, a densely packed shell of somatic cells that contains an immature oocyte. Folliculogenesis describes the progression of a number of small \"primordial follicles\" into large \"preovulatory follicles\" that occurs in part during the menstrual cycle.\n\nContrary to male spermatogenesis, which can last indefinitely, folliculogenesis ends when the remaining follicles in the ovaries are incapable of responding to the hormonal cues that previously recruited some follicles to mature. This depletion in follicle supply signals the beginning of menopause.\n\nThe primary role of the follicle is oocyte support. From birth, the ovaries of the human female contain a number of immature, primordial follicles. These follicles each contain a similarly immature primary oocyte. At puberty clutches of follicles begin folliculogenesis, entering a growth pattern that ends in death (apoptosis) or in ovulation (the process where the oocyte leaves the follicle).\n\nDuring follicular development, primordial follicles undergo a series of critical changes in character, both histologically and hormonally. First they change into primary follicles and later into secondary follicles. The follicles then transition to tertiary, or antral, follicles. At this stage in development, they become dependent on hormones, particularly FSH which causes a substantial increase in their growth rate. The late tertiary or pre-ovulatory follicle ruptures and discharges the oocyte (that has become a secondary oocyte), ending folliculogenesis.\n\nFolliculogenesis is continuous, meaning that at any time the ovary contains follicles in many stages of development. The majority of follicles die and never complete development. A few develop fully to produce a secondary oocyte which is released by rupture of the follicle in a process called ovulation.\n\nThe growing follicle passes through the following distinct stages that are defined by certain structural characteristics:\n\nIn a larger perspective, the whole folliculogenesis, from primordial to preovulatory follicle, belongs to the stage of ootidogenesis of oogenesis.\n\nIn addition, follicles that have formed an antrum are called antral follicles or Graafian follicles. Definitions differ in where this shift occurs in the staging given above, with some stating that it occurs when entering the \"secondary\" stage, and others stating that it occurs when entering the \"tertiary\" stage.\n\nUntil the preovulatory stage, the follicle contains a primary oocyte that is arrested in prophase of meiosis I. During the late preovulatory stage, the oocyte continues meiosis and becomes a secondary oocyte, arrested in metaphase II.\n\nAt 18–22 weeks post-conception, the cortex of the female ovary (foetal female ovary) contains its peak number of follicles (about 4 to 5 million in the average case, but individual peak populations range from 6 to 7 million). These \"primordial follicles\" contain immature oocytes surrounded by flat, squamous granulosa cells (support cells) that are segregated from the oocyte's environment by the basal lamina. They are quiescent, showing little to no biological activity. Because primordial follicles can be dormant for up to 50 years in the human, the length of the ovarian cycle does not include this time.\n\nThe supply of follicles decreases slightly before birth, and to 180,000 by puberty for the average case (populations at puberty range from 25,000 to 1.5 million). By virtue of the \"inefficient\" nature of folliculogenesis (discussed later), only 400 of these follicles will ever reach the preovulatory stage. At menopause, only 1,000 follicles remain. It seems likely that early menopause occurs for women with low populations at birth, and late menopause occurs for women with high populations at birth, but there is as yet no clinical evidence for this.\n\nThe process by which primordial cells 'wake up' is known as initial recruitment. Research has shown that initial recruitment is mediated by the counterbalance of various stimulatory and inhibitory hormones and locally produced growth factors.\n\nDuring ovarian follicle activation, the granulosa cells of the primordial follicles change from a flat to a cuboidal structure, marking the beginning of the \"primary follicle\". The oocyte genome is activated and genes become transcribed. Rudimentary paracrine signalling pathways that are vital for communication between the follicle and oocyte are formed. Both the oocyte and the follicle grow dramatically, increasing to almost 0.1 mm in diameter.\n\nPrimary follicles develop receptors to follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) at this time, but they are gonadotropin-independent until the antral stage. Research has shown, however, that the presence of FSH accelerates follicle growth \"in vitro\".\n\nA glycoprotein polymer capsule called the zona pellucida forms around the oocyte, separating it from the surrounding granulosa cells. The zona pellucida, which remains with the oocyte after ovulation, contains enzymes that catalyze with sperm to allow penetration.\n\nStroma-like theca cells are recruited by oocyte-secreted signals. They surround the follicle's outermost layer, the basal lamina, and undergo cytodifferentiation to become the theca externa and theca interna. An intricate network of capillary vessels forms between these two thecal layers and begins to circulate blood to and from the follicle.\n\nThe late-term secondary follicle is marked histologically and structurally by a fully grown oocyte surrounded by a zona pellucida, approximately nine layers of granulosa cells, a basal lamina, a theca interna, a capillary net, and a theca externa. The development of the antrum also starts taking place in secondary follicle stage\n\nThe formation of a fluid-filled cavity adjacent to the oocyte called the antrum designates the follicle as an antral follicle, in contrast to a so-called \"preantral follicle\" that still lacks an antrum. An antral follicle is also called a \"Graafian follicle\".\n\nDefinitions differ as to which stage this shift occurs in, with some designating follicles in the \"secondary\" stage as \"antral\", and others designating them as \"preantral\".\n\nIn the \"tertiary follicle\", the basic structure of the mature follicle has formed and no novel cells are detectable. Granulosa and theca cells continue to undergo mitotis concomitant with an increase in antrum volume. Tertiary follicles can attain a tremendous size that is hampered only by the availability of FSH, which it is now dependent on.\n\nUnder action of an oocyte-secreted morphogenic gradient, the granulosa cells of the tertiary follicle undergo differentiation into four distinct subtypes: \"corona radiata\", surrounding the zona pellucida; \"membrana\", interior to the basal lamina; \"periantral\", adjacent to the antrum and \"cumulus oophorous\", which connects the membrana and corona radiata granulosa cells together. Each type of cell behaves differently in response to FSH.\n\nTheca interna cells express receptors for luteinizing hormone (LH). LH induces the production of androgens by the theca cells, most notably androstendione, which are aromatized by granulosa cells to produce estrogens, primarily estradiol. Consequently, estrogen levels begin to rise.\n\nAt this point, the majority of the group of follicles that started growth have died. This process of follicle death is known as \"atresia\", and it is characterized by radical apoptosis of all constituent cells and the oocyte. Although it is not known what causes atresia, the presence of high concentrations of FSH has been shown to prevent it.\n\nA rise in pituitary FSH caused by the disintegration of the corpus luteum at the conclusion of a menstrual cycle precipitates the recruitment of five to seven class 5 follicles to participate in the next cycle. These follicles enter the end of the prior menstrual cycle and transition into the follicular phase of the next one. The selected follicles, called antral follicles, compete with each other for growth-inducing FSH.\n\nThe pattern of this emergence of a cohort of five to seven antral follicles is debated. There are theories of continuous recruitment of antral follicles, theories of a single recruitment episode at the end of the luteal phase, and more recently there has been evidence for a recruitment model marked by 2 - 3 waves of follicle recruitment and development during the menstrual cycle (only one of which is actually an ovulatory wave).\n\nIn response to the rise of FSH, the antral follicles begin to secrete estrogen and inhibin, which have a negative feedback effect on FSH. Follicles that have fewer FSH-receptors will not be able to develop further; they will show retardation of their growth rate and become atretic. Eventually, only one follicle will be viable. This remaining follicle, called the \"dominant follicle\", will grow quickly and dramatically—up to 20 mm in diameter—to become the \"preovulatory follicle\".\n\n\"Note: Many sources misrepresent the pace of follicle growth, some even suggesting that it takes only fourteen days for a primordial follicle to become preovulatory. Actually, the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle means the time between selection of a tertiary follicle and its subsequent growth into a preovulatory follicle. The actual time for development of a follicle varies. \"\n\nThe growth of the dominant follicle during the follicular phase is about 1.5 mm per day (±0.1 mm), both in natural cycles and for any dominant follicle developing while taking combined oral contraceptive pill. Performing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation leads to a greater recruitment of follicles, growing at about 1.6 mm per day.\n\nBy the end of the follicular (or proliferative) phase of the thirteenth day of the menstrual cycle, the cumulus oophorus layer of the preovulatory follicle will develop an opening, or \"stigma\", and excrete the oocyte with a complement of cumulus cells in a process called ovulation. In natural cycles, ovulation may occur in follicles that are at least 14 mm.\n\nThe oocyte is technically still a secondary oocyte, suspended in the metaphase II of meiosis. It will develop into an ootid, and rapidly thereafter into an ovum (via completion of meiosis II) only upon fertilization. The oocyte will now travel down one of the fallopian tubes to eventually be discharged through menstruation in the case that it is unfertilized or if it is not successfully implanted in the uterus (if previously fertilized).\n\nThe ruptured follicle will undergo a dramatic transformation into the corpus luteum, a steroidiogenic cluster of cells that maintains the endometrium of the uterus by the secretion of large amounts of progesterone and minor amounts of estrogen.\n\nThese two steps, while not part of folliculogenesis, are included for completeness. They are discussed in their entirety by their respective articles, and placed into perspective by the menstrual cycle article. It is recommended that these three topics be reviewed.\n\nAs with most things related to the reproductive system, folliculogenesis is controlled by the endocrine system. Five hormones participate in an intricate process of positive and negative feedback to regulate folliculogenesis. They are:\n\nGnRH stimulates the release of FSH and LH from the anterior pituitary gland that will later have a stimulatory effect on follicle growth (not immediately, however, because only antral follicles are dependent on FSH and LH). When theca cells form in the tertiary follicle the amount of estrogen increases sharply (theca-derived androgen is aromatized into estrogen by the granulosa cells).\n\nAt low concentration, estrogen inhibits gonadotropins, but high concentration of estrogen stimulates them. In addition, as more estrogen is secreted, more LH receptors are made by the theca cells, inciting theca cells to create more androgen that will become estrogen downstream. This positive feedback loop causes LH to spike sharply, and it is this spike that causes ovulation.\n\nFollowing ovulation, LH stimulates the formation of the corpus luteum. Estrogen has since dropped to negative stimulatory levels after ovulation and therefore serves to maintain the concentration of FSH and LH. Inhibin, which is also secreted by the corpus luteum, contributes to FSH inhibition.\n\nThe endocrine system coincides with the menstrual cycle and goes through thirteen cycles (and thus thirteen LH spikes) during the course of normal folliculogenesis. However, coordinated enzyme signalling and the time-specific expression of hormonal receptors ensures that follicle growth does not become disregulated during these premature spikes.\n\nRecently, two publications have challenged the idea that a finite number of follicles are set around the time of birth. Renewal of ovarian follicles from germline stem cells (originating from bone marrow and peripheral blood) was reported in the postnatal mouse ovary. Studies attempting to replicate these results are underway, but a study of populations in 325 human ovaries found no supporting evidence for follicular replenishment.\n\nIn 2010, researchers at the University of Edinburgh determined that by the time women are 30 years old, only 10% of their non-growing follicles (NGFs) remain. At birth, women have all their follicles for folliculogenesis, and they steadily decline until menopause.\n\nAs women (and mice) age, double-strand breaks accumulate in their primordial follicle reserve. These follicles contain primary oocytes that are arrested in prophase of the first cell division of meiosis. Double-strand breaks are accurately repaired during meiosis by searching for, and building off of, the matching strand (termed “homologous recombinational repair”). Titus et al. (2013) found that, as humans (and mice) age, expression of four key DNA repair genes necessary for homologous recombinational repair declines in oocytes. They hypothesized that DNA double-strand break repair is vital for the maintenance of oocyte reserve, and that a decline in efficiency of repair with age plays a key role in the depletion of the ovarian reserve (ovarian aging).\n\n\n"}

It was the last of a number of works composed toward the end of his life which were deeply autobiographical in nature. Previous elements in this group included \"The Confessions\" and \"\". \n\nThe book is divided into ten chapters called \"Walks\". Walks One to Seven are complete, the Eighth and Ninth Walks were completed but not revised by Rousseau, while the Tenth Walk was incomplete at the author’s death. The first publication was in 1782.\n\nThe content of the book is a mix of autobiographical anecdote, descriptions of the sights, especially plants, that Rousseau saw in his walks on the outskirts of Paris, and elaborations and extensions of arguments previously made by Rousseau in fields like education and political philosophy. \n\nThe work is in large parts marked by serenity and resignation, but also bears witness to Rousseau’s ever-increasing paranoia towards the end of his life.\n\n\"Reveries of the Solitary Walker\" has been described as the most beautiful book composed by Rousseau, comprising a series of exquisitely crafted essays. It has been argued that each of the ten walks in Rousseau's book has a unique musical tonality combined with internal variations. \"He struck a new romantic note by suggesting that the meditative spirit may always find in nature something responsive to its mood.\" Before Rousseau's book the word \"reverie\" had a negative connotation: a 1771 dictionary defined the word as \"ridiculous imagination\" or \"anxieties and cares that preoccupy the mind.\" Through his book, Rousseau helped create a positive connotation for the word by reveling in experiences that circumvented conscious thought.\n\n"}

Other influences include Xing Yi Quan (Hsing-Yi) Kung Fu.\n\nTrias was first introduced to karate while in the Navy during World War II, when he was stationed in the Solomon Islands. In 1944 Robert Trias met Tung Gee Hsing and began training with him. Hsing practiced the Chinese system of Xingyiquan and had reportedly cross-trained with Motobu Chōki in the Okinawan village of Kume Mura several years previously. Later Trias reportedly studied with Hoy Yuan Ping in Singapore in 1944. In addition to these teachers, Trias learned from other martial art teachers, such as Yajui Yamada (judo), Gogen Yamaguchi (Gōjū-ryū), Roy Oshiro (Gōjū-ryū), Yasuhiro Konishi, Makoto Gima (Shotokan, Shitō-ryū), and several others. Both Konishi and Gima served as mentors to Trias instead of in a formal teacher-student relationship.\n\nKonishi, a prominent student of Gichin Funakoshi, Choki Motobu, and Kenwa Mabuni, recognized and countersigned Trias's promotion certificate to 9th Dan by the USKA in the 1960s.\n\nGima was a prominent student of Funakoshi and he recognized Trias as 10th Dan in 1983, reaffirming Trias as style head for Shuri-ryū.\n\nIn addition to the punches, blocks, and kicks of karate, Shuri-ryū also incorporates joint locks, take-downs and throws, and \"kobudō\" (traditional weapons). Several senior sensei also hold high ranks in jujitsu and judo.\n\nShuri Ryu follows a system of teachings called the Haryu which are identifiers of the system.\n\nShuri-ryū also has several short combinations. These include: 26 \"ippon\" (\"ippon kumite kata\"), which are performed to develop form and power; 10 \"taezu\" (\"taezu naru waza\") which are performed to develop speed and fluidity; 30 \"kihon\" which are performed to develop fighting technique; eight \"sen-te\" motions; and seven \"kogeki-ho ho\" to develop attacking and retreating.\n\nIn addition, there are training exercises including form sparring (\"kata kumite\"), focus stance sparring (\"kime dachi kumite\"), free exercise (\"jiyū undō\"), and free sparring (\"jiyū kumite\").\n\nShuri-ryū has three form exercises called \"Taikyoku Shodan, Nidan\", and \"Sandan\" to prepare the student to learn the 15 core forms (\"kata\"):\n\nBesides these forms, there exist numerous variations of \"Sanchin\" and \"Tenshō\". Also, the senior sensei of Shuri-ryū also teach several other forms such as \"Shudo So\" and \"Hakutsuru Shodan, Nidan, Sandan\", and \"Yondan\".\n\nMany of the above \"kata\" emphasize the use of various animal forms, and the definitions are often reflective of this. For example, \"Wunsu\" (Strong Arm Dumping Form or Dragon Boy Dumping Form) uses the tiger form, \"Anaku\" refers to a swallow pivoting on a beach, \"Empisho\" (First Elbow Form) refers to the flying swallow, and \"Go Pei Sho\" refers to a tearing peacock. Some kata will emphasize multiple animal forms, such as \"Dan Enn Sho\", where ten animals are emulated. Also, there are 15 animal body and 20 fist form exercises. This is atypical of what is taught and practiced on the Island of Okinawa.\n\nThe Shuri-ryū style, like most systems of the martial arts, uses a belt system to designate rank. The appropriate rank is awarded when the student demonstrates a certain level of proficiency when performing the required techniques, kata, etc. The ranking system as spelled out in \"The Pinnacle of Karate\" by Trias is as follows:\n\n\nAt each rank, the student must also pass a rigorous physical requirement before performing the technical requirements. Running one or two miles (up to green = 1 mile, purple and beyond = 2 miles), lifting 10 or 15 lb weights 75 times over the head (depending on gender), performing 500–1000 front kicks, and various hand technique exercises are commonly used.\n\nOne characteristic feature of Shuri-ryū is the use of the Shuri fist, in lieu of a standard fist. Instead of curling the index finger when making the fist, the upper half of the index finger is laid flat against the palm, with the thumb curled around the index finger and pushing down between the first and second joints, resulting in a tighter fist and better alignment of the ulna and radius bones with the first two knuckles of the fist.\n\nAnother feature of Shuri-ryū is the position of the thumb of the knife hand strike or block. The thumb and forefinger form a \"j\" so that the hand may be used in a variety of techniques (ridgehand, spearhand, open-hand throat strikes, etc.) without changing the thumb position.\n\nA feature seen in katas: when the next move is to be done, the head snaps in the direction of the attacker before anything else.\n\nThe Dojo Kun used by the style of Shuri-ryū remains in its intact form, as originally penned by Trias:\n\n\nPrior to 1989, Trias had designated 8 Chief Instructors and 3 assistant Chief Instructors of the Shuri-ryū system to perpetuate Shuri-ryū after his death; Roberta Trias-Kelley, John Pachivas, Robert Bowles, the late , Pete Rabino, Michael Awad, Dale Benson, and Dirk Mosig,\n\nOther individuals who were designated Chief Instructors at one time but left Trias are Victor Moore, Phillip Koeppel (his most senior student), James McLain, John Hutchcroft, and Randy Holman.\n\nTraditionally, a karate system was owned by the family of the founder. Thus, upon Trias' death in 1989, his daughter, Roberta Trias-Kelley, inherited the Shuri-ryū system as style head. Dirk Mosig followed her leadership. Eventually three factions developed from the Shuri-ryū style.\n\nIn 1995 John Pachivas appointed Robert Bowles as style head of Shuri-ryū. Bowles founded the International Shuri-ryū Association (ISA) with the following Chief Instructors as Executive Directors: John Pachivas, Ridgely Abele, Pete Rabino, Michael Awad, and Dale Benson. Since then, the International Shuri-ryū Association under Robert Bowles has become the largest organization of Shuri-ryū stylists and has appointed more Chief Instructors and more Assistant Chief Instructors for the ISA. Additionally prior to his death in 2000, John Pachivas passed on his American Shuri Karate lineage to Jerry Piddington.\n\nA number of Shuri-ryu stylists can also be found in the United States Karate-Do Kai (USKK), an organization founded by former Chief Instructor and Trias' senior most student, Phillip Koeppel. Unlike the ISA, the USKK has not appointed new Chief Instructors. Instead, Koeppel appointed a Style Head which serves a similar function. The current USKK Style Head for Shuri-ryu is David Hamann, other senior instructors in this group include James McLain and Michael Awad. Former Chief Instructors Phillip Koeppel and John Hutchcroft are also USKK members, though they now practice Matsumura Seito Shorin-Ryu. Another USKK member and Trias student, Glenn R. Keeney also teaches Shuri-Ryu.\n\nCurrently, there appears to be four strains of Shuri-ryū each, respectively, centering on Roberta Trias-Kelley, Robert Bowles' ISA, Victor Moore's TWKA, and the USKK group under McLain/Awad/Hamann. Membership in the various organizations is not mutually exclusive, and many Shuri-ryu practitioners are active in multiple groups.\n\nThe instructors below are either spelled out to be Chief Instructors in \"The Pinnacle of Karate\" or affiliated with the ISA /USKK.\n\n\n\n\ncurrent as of 9/2017\n\nReggie Venson 7th Dan Illinois\nJon Wong 5th Dan Florida\n\n\n\n\n"}

A graduate of Denver's Manual High School and Amherst College and a Marshall Scholar, he is also a professor and the director of the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute of New York University. He teaches graduate courses in the Literary Reportage concentration and undergraduate courses on the \"journalism of empathy\" and undercover reporting.\n\nConover's books of narrative nonfiction have typically been researches of little-known social groups. He will often become an active participant with the subculture he is writing about. His first experiment with this melding of anthropological and journalistic method occurred during 1980, when he rode freight railroads back and forth across the western United States with some of the last remaining hobos. This experience, initially rendered as an ethnography for an honors thesis, became the basis of his first-person book, \"Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America's Hoboes\" (1984).\n\nSome of those people Conover met on the rails were Mexican nationals, and in his next book, \"Coyotes: A Journey Across Borders with America's Illegal Migrants\" (1987), he turned his attention to undocumented immigrants, describing them as \"the true modern-day incarnation of the classic American hobo.\" Conover spent a year traveling with Mexicans in order to write \"Coyotes\"; he lived in a \"feeder\" valley in the Mexican state of Querétaro, spent time in Arizona, Idaho, California, and Florida, and crossed the border three times. The 1987 book was published in a new edition during 2006 with a new preface and subtitle: \"A Journey Across Borders With America's Mexican Migrants.\"\n\nHis next project, which he has stated he began in part to see whether the participatory method could work with wealthier people, describes life in the mining-town-turned-lifestyle-capital of Aspen, Colorado, where Conover worked as a driver for the Mellow Yellow Taxi Company, the Aspen Times, and for a catering company. The result was the book \"Whiteout: Lost in Aspen\" (1991).\n\nA few years later, Conover trained as a corrections officer and worked at Sing Sing prison in New York state for nearly a year as a rookie correction officer. The resulting book, \"\" (2000), was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and won the 2000 National Book Critics Circle Award in General Nonfiction, among other honors. For many months, prisoners were banned from reading \"Newjack\"; now, inmates who receive a copy have to wait as much as several months while the state redacts several pages that it considers a threat to security.\n\nConover discussed his next work, \"The Routes of Man: Travels in the Paved World\" (2010) in the Paper Cuts weblog of the \"New York Times Book Review.\" His most recent book, Immersion: A Writer's Guide To Going Deep, explores the practical and ethical challenges of immersive reporting, citing examples from his own work and that of other writers such as Sebastian Junger, Anne Fadiman, Susan Orlean and Jon Krakauer. He discussed the book with journalist Kevin Deutsch in a Q&A for the \"Columbia Journalism Review\"<nowiki></nowiki>].\n\nIn addition to books, much of Conover's work has been published in magazines. He contributes frequently to \"The New York Times Magazine\", \"The New Yorker\", \"The Atlantic Monthly\", \"Vanity Fair\", \"T Magazine,\" \"National Geographic Magazine\", \"Travel + Leisure\", \"Smithsonian Magazine\" and others.

They were heavily influenced by the hardcore scene that flourished during their youth in the D.C. area. They began playing together in a series of bands while in their teens and then all attended Oberlin College in Ohio, where they continued to play together. The three friends then moved to Brooklyn, New York after college, where the French Kicks were formed with vocalist/guitarist Josh Wise, a Princeton grad who originally hailed from Huntsville, Alabama.\n\nHaving performed their first shows at Luna Lounge on Manhattan's Lower East Side, in 1999 they released a self-titled EP \"The French Kicks\" under the label My Pal God. Soon, after a lot of touring, the band signed to Startime International. They soon released the \"Young Lawyer\" EP in 2001. The group then embarked on a tour with fellow garage rockers The Vue and The Walkmen. In 2002 they released their first full-length album, \"One Time Bells\". Jamie Krents departed the band the next year, and was replaced on bass by Lawrence Stumpf, Nick's younger brother. The following year they headlined Sepomana, WRMC 91.1 FM's annual music festival. In 2004, their next album, \"The Trial of the Century\" was released. Another personnel change occurred when Nick stopped playing drums at live shows to concentrate on his lead singing. A series of temporary drummers filled his spot until the band settled on Aaron Thurston, a Massachusetts native.

During the 1970s he worked as an editor and designer at \"Métal hurlant\", drew comics for \"L'Écho des savanes\" and \"Fluide Glacial\" along with who would also join Caro on his movie projects.\n\nIn 1974 Caro met and befriended Jean-Pierre Jeunet at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival which led to a long-lasting collaboration. Together they directed two animated shorts, \"L'évasion\" (The Escape, 1978) and \"Le manège\" (The Carousel, 1980) which was awarded the César Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 6th César Awards in 1981. Same year they wrote and co-directed a short art film \"Le Bunker de la dernière rafale\" (The Bunker of the Last Gunshots) where the pair also worked as cinematographers, editors, set decorators, costume designers, even actors. Caro also produced shorts, ads and music clips on his own.\n\nIn 1991 they directed their first feature film, a dark comedy \"Delicatessen\" which launched their careers: the film won the Gold Hugo at the Chicago International Film Festival and Tokyo Gold Prize at the Tokyo International Film Festival in 1991, César Awards for Best Debut and Best Writing at the 17th César Awards (1992) and the Best Director award at the Sitges Film Festival (1993). As Caro described their working process,\n\"Jean-Pierre handles direction in the traditional sense of the word, that is, the direction of the actors, etc., while I do the artistic direction. Beyond that, in the day-to-day workings of the shoot of preproduction, it's obviously much more of a mixture. We write together, film together, edit together. According to each of our specialties, sometimes we'll be drawn to what we do best. There's a real complicity between us.\n\nThe success of \"Delicatessen\" allowed them to return to their early project — a science fantasy film \"The City of Lost Children\" which they conceived in the early 1980s, but weren't able to produce due to the lack of funding. It was released in 1995 and entered the 1995 Cannes Film Festival. The friends were then suggested to direct the fourth \"Alien\" installment, \"Alien Resurrection\", and while Jeunet agreed, Caro refused to work on a film over which he lacked creative control, although he was persuaded to spend three weeks in Hollywood working on costume and set design. This movie marked the end of their creative partnership.\n\nDuring the next 10 years Caro contributed to various projects as an art director, character designer and actor, often collaborating with Jan Kounen on his films. In 2008 he released \"Dante 01\", his first feature film as a solo director which went almost unnoticed. In 2009 he directed a 53-minute documentary \"Astroboy à Roboland\" based on the Astro Boy franchise. He returned to directing only in 2018 with a 5-minute short \"Loop\".\n\nIn 2011 he became one of the initiators of the joined French-Japanese 3D animated movie \"Windwalkers: Chronicle of the 34th Horde\" working as an art director and visual effects supervisor, with Kounen attached as a director. The movie was based on the top-selling French novel \"La Horde du Contrevent\" by Alain Damasio and received a budget of €18 million ($23.4 million), but after American distributors requested to \"marvelise\" the script which they found \"indigestible and too complicated\", Caro and Kounen left the project which was eventually frozen in 2015.\n\n\n\n"}

The operation was launched on 25 May 1944, and was aimed at capturing or killing the Partisan leader Marshal Josip Broz Tito and destroying the headquarters, support facilities and co-located Allied military missions. It is associated with the Seventh Enemy Offensive () in Yugoslav history, forming part of the Seven Enemy Offensives historiographical framework. The airborne assault itself is also known as the Raid on Drvar ().\n\nOperation Rösselsprung was a coup de main operation, involving direct action by a combined parachute and glider-borne assault by the 500th SS Parachute Battalion and a planned subsequent link-up with ground forces of the XV Mountain Corps converging on Drvar. The airborne assault was preceded by heavy bombing of the town by the Luftwaffe. The ground forces included Home Guard forces of the Independent State of Croatia along with collaborationist Chetniks. Tito, his principal headquarters staff and the Allied military personnel escaped, despite their presence in Drvar at the time of the airborne assault. Fierce Partisan resistance in the town itself and along the approaches to Drvar contributed to the failure of the mission. Other factors included the German intelligence agencies refusing to share the limited information available on Tito's exact location, and the lack of contingency planning by the commander of the German airborne force.\n\nOn 6 April 1941 the Axis powers invaded Yugoslavia from multiple directions, rapidly overwhelming the under-prepared Royal Yugoslav Army which capitulated 11 days later. In the aftermath of the invasion Yugoslavia was partitioned between the Axis powers through a combination of annexations and occupation zones. An Axis puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia (, NDH) was established on the territory of modern-day Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, controlled by the fascist and ultra-nationalist \"Ustaše\". The NDH was divided by a German–Italian demarcation line, known as the \"Vienna Line\"; the Germans occupied the north and northeastern parts of the NDH, and the Italians the south and southwestern sections. The NDH immediately implemented genocidal policies against the Serb, Jewish and Romani population of the puppet state.\n\nFollowing the collapse of Yugoslavia, armed groups appeared, and in the territory of the NDH, while the predominantly Serb resistance to \"Ustaše\" rule was initially not strongly aligned with ideology, two principal groups soon established themselves, the communist-led Partisans and the Serb nationalist Chetniks. The Partisans were resolutely anti-Axis throughout the war, but the Chetniks extensively collaborated with Italian occupation forces garrisoned in the NDH from mid-1941, and especially after the Italian capitulation in September 1943, also with the Germans. \n\nThe Axis Case White and Case Black offensives of the first six months of 1943 caused significant setbacks for the Partisans; however, in September the Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito took advantage of the capitulation of Italy and managed to increase the territory under his control and double his forces to around 200,000 men, arming them with captured Italian weapons. In late November, he held a National Congress at Jajce in a liberated area of the NDH, during which he was designated marshal of Yugoslavia and prime minister. He established his headquarters nearby at Drvar in the Dinaric Alps and temporarily suspended his successful tactic of being constantly on the move. Maximilian von Weichs, the Wehrmacht Commander-in-chief Southeast Europe, admitted a few weeks later that \"Tito is our most dangerous enemy.\"\n\nTito's personal headquarters was initially located in a cave below a ridgeline about north of the centre of Drvar. Below the cave ran the Unac River, creating an obstacle to movement between the town and the cave, and a rail line ran along the ridgeline above the cave. As well as Partisan headquarters, several Partisan and Communist Party support, training and youth organisations were based in and around Drvar at the time, along with the Tito Escort Battalion which was responsible for Tito's personal safety. The British and Soviet military missions to the Partisans were also stationed in villages close to Drvar, as were some United States military officers. The British mission was headed by Brigadier Fitzroy Maclean, who was in London at the time of the raid, and included Major Randolph Churchill, son of Winston Churchill. At the time of Operation Rösselsprung (), the British mission was led by its second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Vivian Street.\n\nApart from Partisan headquarters and related organisations in and around Drvar, there were between 12,000 and 16,000 Partisans in the area of operations that would be subject to the ground assault by XV Mountain Corps. Near Drvar were elements of the 1st Proletarian Corps commanded by Koča Popović; this corps consisted of the elite 1st Proletarian and 6th Lika Proletarian Divisions, the Corps headquarters being located in the village of Mokronoge, east of Drvar. Its subordinate formations were further away, the 6th Lika Proletarian Division west of Drvar, and the 1st Proletarian Division deployed in the area around Jajce and Mrkonjić Grad, some east of Drvar. The nearest large Partisan formation to Drvar was the 3rd Lika Proletarian Brigade of the 6th Lika Proletarian Division based in the Resanovci and Trubar villages some south and southwest of Drvar.\n\nIn the wider area of operations were the Partisan 5th Corps commanded by Slavko Rodić and the 8th Corps commanded by Vlado Ćetković. The 5th Corps was deployed to the northeast and northwest of Drvar with its headquarters south of the Mrkonjić Grad–Ključ road, and the 8th Corps was positioned to the southeast with its headquarters in the mountains between the Glamoč and Livno valleys. Importantly for the coming battle, the 4th Krajina Division of the 5th Corps was deployed between Bihać and Bosanski Petrovac. Two brigades of the 4th Krajina Division and one brigade from the 39th Krajina Division formed a defensive arc north of Drvar, running from Bihać through Krupa to Sanski Most. The 9th Dalmatian Division of the 8th Corps was deployed to the south between Livno and Bosansko Grahovo.\n\nThree German intelligence organisations attempted to determine the location of Tito's headquarters and the disposition of Partisan forces in Drvar. The first of these was the Benesch Special Unit of Section II of the (the Wehrmacht intelligence service), some members of which had been involved in identifying Tito's presence in the town of Jajce prior to the German offensive to retake the town. The Benesch Special Unit was part of the Brandenburg Division, and was staffed by ethnic Germans who spoke local languages. The unit had many contacts with both the Chetniks and the Ustaše Militia, and had been tracking Tito since October 1943. Kirchner of that unit had been responsible for locating Tito before the re-capture of Jajce, and he established a patrol base near Bosansko Grahovo. He got very close to the Drvar cave, and located the Allied military missions, but despite German radio intercepts confirming that Drvar was the site of Tito's headquarters, Kirchner was unable to pinpoint the cave as the location of the headquarters. Kirchner was attached to the 500th SS Parachute Battalion for the operation.\n\nThe second intelligence organisation was FAT (Front Reconnaissance Troop) 216 of Section I of the . FAT216, commanded by Zavadil, was also attached to the 500th SS Parachute Battalion, but did not contribute much to the intelligence used to plan the raid.\n\nOn Adolf Hitler's orders, Otto Skorzeny of the (SD, the intelligence branch of the SS), who had commanded the operation to rescue Mussolini in September 1943, was independently involved in intelligence gathering in the lead-up to the raid. Skorzeny acted on behalf of the SD, and after obtaining information from a Partisan deserter that pinpointed Tito's headquarters at the cave, he proposed a plan to infiltrate Drvar with a small group of soldiers to assassinate Tito. Skorzeny soon discovered that the plan to eliminate Tito had been compromised, and had nothing further to do with the operation. It appears that he did not pass on the useful intelligence he had gathered to Kurt Rybka, the commander of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion, who was responsible for planning the critical airborne aspects of the operation. Largely due to interservice rivalry and competition, the three organisations did not share the intelligence they gathered, which had a significant effect on the tactical planning and execution of the operation. The Germans found forged documents that stated 25 May was Tito's birthday and therefore planned the attack for that day.\n\nThe Partisans had their own highly effective intelligence network. They had been aware of the presence of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion in Yugoslavia for some time, and of the general threat of an airborne assault for over six months. They may have become aware of the isolation of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion or the concentration of transport aircraft and gliders at Zagreb and Banja Luka over a month before the operation. The Partisans also managed to recapture the deserter Skorzeny had interrogated. As a result of these early indicators of an attack, Tito's main headquarters was relocated to another cave near the village of Bastasi, west of Drvar. Tito then used the Drvar cave during the day, but returned to the Bastasi cave at night. As a further precaution, elements of the 6th Lika Proletarian Division were moved closer to Drvar.\n\nOn 23 May 1944, a single German Fieseler Fi 156 reconnaissance aircraft flew several parallel runs up and down the Una valley over Drvar at around ; activity consistent with conducting aerial photography. The aircraft paid particular attention to the villages of Prinavor and Trninić Brijeg where the British military mission and American military personnel were located. This was observed by Street, the acting commander of the British military mission, who assumed it was spotting for a bombing raid and advised both Tito and the Americans. Both Allied missions moved their locations as a result.\n\nDespite the intelligence received and observations made by the British, the Partisans appear to have been quite complacent about the threat; Tito's chief of staff, Arso Jovanović, swore that \"a German attack was impossible\". The most obvious indicator that Tito was unaware of the imminent attack is that he remained at the Drvar cave overnight on the evening of 24 May, following a celebration, instead of returning to Bastasi.\n\nThrough Ultra intercepts of German signal traffic, the British had become aware that the Germans were planning an operation codenamed \"Rösselsprung\" but the information available did not include where the operation would occur or what its objectives might be.\n\nFollowing intelligence collection, higher level planning for the operation began on 6 May 1944, after von Weichs had issued his initial orders. Hitler gave his approval to von Weichs' final plans on 21 May. The order to XV Mountain Corps was issued by Lothar Rendulic, the commander of 2nd Panzer Army, on the same day, leaving only three days for preparation. Ernst von Leyser, commander of XV Mountain Corps headquartered at Knin, was responsible for the conduct of the operation. The ground forces of von Leyser's XV Mountain Corps were significantly reinforced from Army Group F, the 2nd Panzer Army and V SS Mountain Corps reserves. These reinforcements included two panzer companies, the reconnaissance battalions of the 1st Mountain Division (the 54th Mountain Reconnaissance Battalion) and the 369th (Croatian) Infantry Division, and most of the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division \"Prinz Eugen\". The total number of German troops allocated to the operation was about 16,000 men.\n\nIn outline, the XV Mountain Corps plan was for a heavy aerial bombardment of Partisan positions in and around Drvar by Luftwaffe aircraft, followed by a parachute and glider assault by the 500th SS Parachute Battalion who had the task of capturing or killing Tito and destroying his headquarters. The assault also included tasks to capture or destroy the Allied military missions to the Partisans. On the same day, ground elements of XV Mountain Corps were to converge on Drvar to link up with the 500th SS Parachute Battalion. A small reconnaissance aircraft was tasked to fly into Drvar after its capture to retrieve Tito or his body.\n\nRybka received an outline of the operation on 20 May, and more details the following day. He realised that the gliders and transport aircraft would be insufficient for the whole of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion to be delivered to Drvar in one lift, so he came up with a plan involving two waves. The first wave of 654 troops would conduct the assault at 07:00 and a second wave of 220 troops would follow about five hours later. Critically, the intelligence he was given regarding the suspected location of Tito's headquarters (codenamed \"Citadel\") was that it was in or near a cemetery on high ground southwest of the centre of Drvar, nearly from Tito's actual headquarters cave. This would have far-reaching effects on the planning and execution of the assault.\n\nRybka's plan for the first wave called for the insertion of 314 parachute troops in three groups (Red, Green and Blue) to secure the town, and another 354 troops in six glider-borne assault groups to carry out specific tasks. The glider-borne group tasks were:\n\n\nThe second wave of 220 troops based on the training company of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion were to insert by parachute at midday.\n\nRybka does not appear to have planned for any significant contingencies such as errors in the intelligence on the location of Tito's headquarters. His only known contingency plan was that he would fire a red signal flare to order all available forces to converge on his position for subsequent tasks.\n\nOn 22 May 1944, the 500th SS Parachute Battalion were transported to airfields at Nagy-Betskerek, Zagreb and Banja Luka, dressed in Wehrmacht uniforms for security reasons. The troops were not briefed on the operation until a few hours before it was launched. They then linked up with their transport aircraft, including the ten-man Luftwaffe DFS230 gliders that would deliver the glider-borne troops onto their objectives. By 24 May, all preparations for the airborne assault were complete.\n\nThe plan for the ground forces of von Leyser's XV Mountain Corps was for nine separate but coordinated thrusts toward the Drvar–Bosanski Petrovac area from all directions. The groupings and tasks were:\n\nThe offensive began at 05:00 on 25 May 1944 with the advance of ground forces from their assembly areas surrounding their assigned operational areas. About 06:35, five squadrons of Luftwaffe bombers, including Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers, began bombing targets within Drvar and Bosanski Petrovac. A total of 440 sorties were flown on that day.\n\nThe 500th SS Parachute Battalion began to parachute and glide onto their objectives at 07:00, most parachutists and glider pilots being able to land relatively close to their targets despite the smoke and dust from the bombing. Some gliders landed significantly off course, including one that landed in front of the Bastasi cave 7 km to the west of Drvar, and several that landed in a locality named Vrtoče near Drvar (not to be confused with Vrtoče between Bihać and Petrovac, which was on the axis of advance of the 92nd Motorised Regiment). The occupants of the glider that landed in Bastasi were immediately killed by members of the Tito Escort Battalion guarding the cave, and the occupants of the gliders at Vrtoče had to fight their way toward Drvar. After landing, the first wave of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion quickly gained control of Drvar.\n\nAbout 2 km further east on the road to Mokronoge was a Partisan officer training school with about 130 students. On hearing the fighting from the direction of Drvar, the students marched west initially armed with only pistols and a few rifles. They split into two groups, a smaller group which crossed the Unac and advanced west along the railway line on the ridge leading toward Tito's cave, and a larger group which collected arms and ammunition from several stray canisters of German equipment dropped by parachute. The larger group of students attacked Green and Blue Groups from the east around 08:00, suffering severe casualties, but maintained continuous pressure on the German flank. About 09:00, the Germans had largely secured Drvar, and the available troops went from house to house, armed with photographs of Tito, brutally questioning the civilians they could find. Soon after this commenced, Rybka realised that Partisan resistance was concentrated to the north in the vicinity of the cave. He therefore fired the red signal flare to rally his troops for an assault in that direction.\n\nAt about 10:30, Rybka launched a frontal attack across the Unac supported by at least one MG42 machine gun firing into the mouth of the cave. The Germans reached the base of the hill, fifty metres from the cave, but suffered severe casualties in the assault. They were also running low on water. Before this attack, Tito and around 20 staff had taken refuge in the cave.\n\nWhile Rybka was assembling his troops for this attack, surrounding Partisan forces were rushed toward Drvar. Three battalions of the 3rd Lika Proletarian Brigade of the 6th Lika Proletarian Division approached from the southeast. One battalion attacked the German position at the cemetery while the other two swung around to strike the Germans from the west.\n\nAbout 11:15, after Rybka's first attack had been defeated, Tito and the small group gathered with him escaped from the cave. There was a platform at the mouth of the cave, and they climbed down a rope through a trapdoor in the platform, although the panic displayed by Tito's mistress Davorjanka Paunović (codenamed \"Zdenka\") and his dog caused some delays. The party split up and following a creek leading away from the Unac, the small groups climbed the heights to the east and withdrew toward the village of Potoci.\n\nThe second wave of parachute troops was dropped in two groups to the west of the cemetery at about midday. The drop zone was within fields of fire of the Partisans to the west of Drvar, and the paratroops suffered many casualties during the drop. Collecting the remainder, Rybka mounted a second attack, but the pressure on his flanks was too heavy, and the assault again failed. Fighting continued throughout the afternoon with both sides taking heavy casualties.\n\nIn the late afternoon, Rybka ordered his forces to withdraw to the area of the cemetery where he formed a defensive perimeter. During the withdrawal, at least one group of troops was cut off and killed. About 18:00, Rybka was wounded by a grenade blast and was later evacuated with other casualties in the light aircraft intended to carry away Tito after his capture. Roughly at the same time, his Partisan counterpart in Drvar, Milan Šijan, the commander of the 3rd Lika Proletarian Brigade, was also wounded by German machine gun fire. By 21:30, the Germans had consolidated their position in the cemetery, although they were completely surrounded by the Partisans. During the night, the 3rd Lika Proletarian Brigade attacked the cemetery, with the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Brigade of the 9th Dalmatian Division reinforcing the assault. At 03:30 on 26 May, the final Partisan attack was launched against the cemetery, breaching the walls in several places, but the paratroopers held on.\n\nAlthough its total strength was estimated at 185,500 men in late May 1944, the 2nd Panzer Army was not able to rally more than 16,000 troops for Operation Rösselsprung due to ever-increasing Partisan activity throughout the country. The Germans had to rely on special forces and improved tactics. The Partisans defended the territory they controlled with significant demolition and mining of roads. Roadblocks were manned by patrols and smaller detachments, whose task was to hold off the enemy until reinforcements arrived. During Operation Rösselsprung, the Germans rendered these tactics ineffective by combining strong and fast motorised columns with adequate pioneer support. This combination was especially successful for the column led by the 92nd Motorised Regiment. The second German tactical innovation was the employment of five reconnaissance battalions for independent operations deep inside Partisan-controlled territory.\n\nThroughout 25 May, the ground forces of XV Mountain Corps were not able to advance as quickly as planned. There was unexpected resistance from the Partisan 1st Proletarian, 5th and 8th Corps along their axes of advance, and there was very poor communication and coordination between the columns. The ground forces were also subjected to Allied air attacks by Air Vice-Marshal William Elliot's Balkan Air Force throughout the day, called in by the British mission using their surviving radio.\n\nAt 05:00 on 25 May, commenced its attack from Srb in an easterly direction, aiming to cover the to Drvar as quickly as possible. It encountered organised resistance from the 2nd Lika Proletarian Brigade of the 6th Lika Proletarian Division. After a day's fighting, the Germans had captured Trubar, but were unable to overcome the defences of the hills east of the village. Recognising the importance of 's task, the commander of the 373th Division, Eduard Aldrian, ordered the battalion group of the 373th Division to abandon its advance from Lapac to Martin Brod and reinforce instead. The remaining brigade of the 6th Lika Proletarian Division, the 1st Lika Proletarian Shock Brigade, was deployed to the north along the Una river. The 2nd Lika Proletarian Brigade requested assistance from the 1st Lika Proletarian Shock Brigade, but divisional headquarters ordered it to send reinforcements to Drvar instead. At 21:00, the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Lika Proletarian Brigade launched a successful local counterattack on the vanguard of , separating it from the main body. Willam then decided to halt the advance and place the remaining units into all-round defence. At 22:25, Aldrian ordered him to resume the attack, but Willam reported that this was impossible due to loss of contact with his own units.\n\nThe 92nd Motorised Regiment consisted of two columns, a western column based on the 92nd Motorised Regiment, and an eastern column consisting of the 54th Reconnaissance Battalion and 1st Home Guard Jäger Regiment of the 2nd Croatian Light Infantry Brigade. The western column advanced southeast from Bihać, and encountered resistance from the 6th Krajina Brigade of the 4th Krajina Division. By the end of the day, the western column had reached Vrtoče, halfway between Bihać and Bosanski Petrovac. Being fully motorised, it used its mobility to outmanoeuvre the Partisans, bypassing their main defensive positions to the west, the Cossack pioneers playing an important role in keeping the column moving. The eastern column started its advance from Bosanska Krupa, aiming to establish contact with the western column at Vrtoče. It advanced 10 km before being held up by the defences of the 8th Krajina Brigade of the 4th Krajina Division.\n\nThe forces commanded by the 7th SS Division were organised into northern, central and southern columns. The northern column consisted of and included a company of tanks. It moved swiftly southwest from its start point near Banja Luka, and had reached Čađavica (at a crossroads halfway between Mrkonjić Grad and Ključ) by the evening of 25 May, brushing off the 16th Krajina Brigade of the 39th Krajina Division deployed on the right flank of its axis of advance. The rapid advance meant that the 13th Krajina Brigade of the 39th Krajina Division was unable to organise an effective defence. The 39th Krajina Division then ordered the 13th Krajina Brigade to block the road from Čađavica to Ključ to prevent the loss of Ključ, but only one battalion of the brigade managed to reach that position by dawn on 26 May.\n\nThe central column consisted of the 7th SS Reconnaissance Battalion reinforced with one battery of self-propelled guns, which had a special task: it was to strike from Mrkonjić Grad, penetrate deeply into the Partisans’ rear and destroy the HQ of the 5th Partisan Corps in Ribnik. Despite having only two battalions in the area (the third was facing at Čađavica), the 13th Proletarian Brigade managed to hold off this thrust. The southern column was based on the 13th SS Mountain Regiment, reinforced by I Battalion of the 7th SS Mountain Artillery Regiment and some Chetniks. This column launched its assault from the Jajce area, and had the task of reaching Mliništa (20 km south of Ključ). By 17:20, II Battalion of the 13th SS Mountain Regiment had taken Šipovo, but any further advance was halted by the defences of the 1st Proletarian Brigade.\n\nThe Germans deployed two columns to attack north from Livno. The 369th Reconnaissance Battalion with some 200 men from the 6th Ustaša Brigade advanced towards Glamoč, and the 105th SS Reconnaissance Battalion with a panzer company thrust in the direction of Bosansko Grahovo. By 16:00 on 25 May 1944, the 369th Reconnaissance Battalion column had reached the village of Han-Vrbe, some 5 km from Bosansko Grahovo. At that point, it was attacked by the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Krajina Brigade and was forced to retreat. During the retreat, this column was attacked by two more battalions of the 3rd Krajina Brigade and was pushed back to its start line at Livno with heavy losses. A preliminary German report estimated their losses at 50, but the 3rd Krajina Brigade estimated German losses at 191 dead and wounded. The 105th SS Reconnaissance Battalion column overcame the resistance of local Partisan units and the 1st and 4th Battalions of the 13th Dalmatian Brigade, and by the end of the day had reached Crni Lug, some 20 km from Bosansko Grahovo. In the evening, the 13th Dalmatian Brigade was ordered to march towards Tičevo and Drvar to reinforce the Partisan forces in that area.\n\nThe 1st Regiment of the Brandenburg Division, reinforced by a pioneer company from the 373rd (Croatian) Infantry Division and the Chetnik Dinara Division, attacked along the Knin–Bosansko Grahovo axis, pushed back the local Grahovo–Peulje Partisan Detachment and by the end of the day had reached positions some 5 km beyond Strmica.\n\nEscorted by elements of the 3rd Krajina Brigade, Tito made his way to Potoci, where he was met by a battalion of the 1st Proletarian Brigade. At Potoci, they were met by the staff of the Allied military missions. The British mission signals officer had brought the only surviving radio. Initially, Tito had been in favour of continuing the attack on the SS paratroopers, but after reassessing the situation, he cancelled further attacks. As the German intention to encircle the Supreme Command in a small area around Drvar with approaching units, and then destroy it with land forces had become apparent by now, serious reorganisation of Partisan dispositions was required. After German troops were observed in the area of Potoci, Tito and his companions were escorted towards Kupres.\n\nThe 2nd Panzer Army was monitoring the operation closely. The report of a special troop, which had been sent into the Partisans’ rear with the help of disguised Chetniks several days earlier, drew particular attention from Rendulic. According to this report, received late on 25 May, Tito was in the area of Potoci, halfway between Drvar and Ribnik. Rendulic ordered the commander of the 7th SS Division to immediately form a special company-strong detachment, with a mission to infiltrate behind the Partisan lines to kill Tito and destroy the Partisan Supreme Command. The detachment was formed on the night of 25/26 May from the 11th Company of the 13th SS Regiment, several pioneers, and a group of specially trained personnel from the Brandenburg Division. As the detachment failed to penetrate into the Partisan territory that night, it tried again the following night.\n\nAbout 05:00 on 26 May, a Luftwaffe fighter-bomber formation engaged the Partisan troops withdrawing from Drvar. The western column of the 92nd Motorised Regiment was ordered to help assist the eastern column by detaching a reinforced panzer company from Vrtoče.\n\nOn the morning of 26 May, the German columns advancing from Bihać towards Ključ, and from Livno and Knin towards Bosansko Grahovo, overcame the Partisan units in their paths, and continued their advance facing little resistance. The 92nd Motorised Grenadier Regiment, advancing from Vrtoče, took Bosanski Petrovac without a fight about 08:00. It continued its march to Drvar and relieved the 500th SS Parachute Battalion at 12:45. established radio contact with the 500th SS Battalion around 07:00, and at 17:00 entered Drvar via Kamenica. The 105th SS Reconnaissance Battalion arrived at Bosansko Grahovo at 10:30, where it was joined by the 1st Regiment of the Brandenburg Division at 16:00. entered Ključ at 14:15.\n\nIn the eastern sector, the Partisan line of defence was still holding. During 26 and 27 May, the 7th SS Division continued exerting strong pressure on the 1st Proletarian Division in the upper Sana River Valley, but failed to achieve a decisive breakthrough. By the end of 27 May, the front line had stabilised to the north and south of Ribnik. After the defeat it had suffered the previous day, the 369th Reconnaissance Battalion column did not resume its advance towards Glamoč on the 26th.\n\nOn 26 May, due to the rapidly changing situation and communications difficulties, a degree of confusion emerged on both sides. Out of contact with their corps headquarters, the 4th Krajina Division continued to retain two brigades along the Bihać-Bosanski Petrovac road, even though the 92nd Motorised Regiment had already passed along this route and into their rear. The critically important Bosanski Petrovac-Ključ road to the south was left unguarded, endangering Tito and Partisan Supreme Headquarters as they fled from Drvar.\n\nXV Mountain Corps failed to recognise and exploit these flaws in Partisan deployments. After the 500th Parachute Battalion had been relieved, the XV Mountain Corps ordered the units in the Drvar area to disperse. The 92nd Motorised Regiment with all subordinated units was ordered to return north and attack the brigades of the 4th Krajina Division on Mount Grmeč, to secure the main supply road from Bihać to Bosanski Petrovac; this action, codenamed \"Grmeč\", was scheduled to start on the morning of 27 May. The 373rd Division with the newly subordinated 1st Regiment of the Brandenburg Division was ordered to conduct a sweep-and-destroy operation in the area south and southeast of Drvar; this operation was codenamed \"Vijenac\", and was to take place concurrently with \"Operation Grmeč\". The 9th Dalmatian Division managed to repulse all attacks on 27 May, pushing the Brandenburgers and Chetniks back to Bosansko Grahovo. On 27 May, the 369th Reconnaissance Battalion column again tried to advance on Glamoč, but with no success.\n\nUnhappy with the development of the operation to this point, Rendulic cancelled Operations \"Grmeč\" and \"Vijenac\" on the afternoon of 27 May, and ordered von Leyser to move all units back to their start positions for a concentric attack on the area where Tito and two Partisan corps headquarters (1st Proletarian and 5th) were believed to be located. The attack was scheduled to begin on the morning of 28 May. Rendulic also sent the 105th SS Reconnaissance Battalion to the Livno-Glamoč area which had been left wide open by the defeat of the 369th Reconnaissance Battalion thrust.\n\nTito, his staff and his escort continued toward Kupres, travelling on foot and horseback, as well as on the wagons of a narrow-gauge logging railway. During this trek, one of the members of the Soviet mission was wounded by shellfire.\n\nThroughout their escape, the British mission were able to maintain contact with their headquarters via radio and continued to call in support from the Balkan Air Force against the German formations taking part in Operation Rösselsprung and the Luftwaffe aircraft in the skies over Yugoslavia. This included over one thousand sorties. A costly ground attack was also launched by a combined Partisan, British and United States force on the German-held Dalmatian island of Brač. Code-named \"Operation Flounced\", the assault was mounted from the British-held island of Vis further out in the Adriatic Sea on the night of 1/2 June. Fighting continued late into 3 June 1944 and resulted in the reinforcement of the island by a further 1,900 German troops. After three days of fighting, the combined forces returned to Vis. The Partisans suffered losses of 67 dead, 308 wounded and 14 missing, and Allied units suffered 60 dead, 74 wounded and 20 missing, with the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Jack Churchill, being captured by the Germans.\n\nAfter six days evading the Germans, the leader of the Soviet mission, Lieutenant General Nikolai Vasilevich Korneev, who had lost a leg in the Battle of Stalingrad, suggested an air evacuation of Tito and the Soviet mission and this was expanded by Street to include the whole party. After three days deliberation, Tito agreed on 3 June and Street arranged the evacuation the same night from an RAF-operated airfield near the town of Kupres. Seven Douglas C-47 Skytrain aircraft, one with a Soviet crew and the remainder with US crew, carried Tito and his party, the Allied missions and 118 wounded Partisans to Bari in Italy. Late on 6 June, Tito was delivered by the Royal Navy escort destroyer to Vis, where he re-established his headquarters and was joined by the Allied missions. The Soviet Foreign Minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, believed that the British had known more about the attack than they claimed, based on the absence of both Maclean and Churchill from Drvar at the time of the attack. On 28 May, he sent a message to Korneev detailing his suspicions.\n\nAlthough Tito's headquarters, along with several other Partisan organisations, was temporarily disrupted and key staff were lost during the operation, all Partisan organisations were quickly re-located and resumed operation. Drvar reverted to Partisan control within a few weeks of the operation. The operation was a failure, as Tito, his principal headquarters staff and the Allied military personnel escaped, despite their presence in Drvar at the time of the airborne assault. The operation failed due to several factors, including Partisan resistance in the town itself and along the approaches to Drvar. The failure of the German intelligence agencies to share the limited information available on Tito's exact location also contributed to the unsuccessful outcome for the Germans, and this failure to share intelligence was compounded by a lack of contingency planning by the commander of the German airborne force.\n\nThe 500th SS Parachute Battalion was decimated during Operation Rösselsprung, suffering 576 killed and 48 wounded. Only 200 soldiers of the battalion were fit to fight on the morning of 26 May. It continued throughout the rest of the war as the only SS parachute unit, although its name was later changed to the 600th SS Parachute Battalion. Operation Rösselsprung was its only combat parachute operation.\n\nAccording to a German report, the ground troops of XV Mountain Corps suffered 213 killed, 881 wounded, and 51 missing during Operation Rösselsprung. The same report claimed that 6,000 Partisans were killed. The commander of the 7th SS Division, Otto Kumm claimed that Partisan losses included 1,916 confirmed and another 1,400 estimated killed, and 161 taken prisoner. Kumm also claimed that six Allied aircraft were shot down during the operation. According to a Partisan source, their total losses were 399 killed, 479 wounded, and at least 85 missing. Of this total, the casualties suffered in fighting with the 500th SS Parachute Battalion at Drvar numbered 179 killed, 63 wounded, and 19 missing. Ultimately, according to intelligence historian Ralph Bennett, \"[t]he long-term significance of the Drvar raid was simply that it failed.\"\n\nAlthough Tito was born on 7 May, after he became president of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, he celebrated his birthday on 25 May to mark the unsuccessful attempt on his life.\n\nOperation Rösselsprung was depicted in the 1963 Partisan film directed by Fadil Hadžić.\n\n\n"}

The Air Chariot is like a flying throne, with two 7.62mm attack guns, reinforced battle shield, and hover engine. He was released in 2002 as a re-issue 2-pack that was exclusive to online retailers. A new mold of Serpentor was released in 2005, as part of a comic three pack, which included a reprint of issue #49 of the Marvel Comics series. Serpentor was released again in 2007 as a single carded figure as part of the 25th anniversary series. This figure was also packaged with a re-release of the Air Chariot in a vehicle 2 pack, and with a DVD set that included the DVD of \"Arise, Serpentor, Arise\".\n\nIn the Marvel Comics series, Serpentor initially appeared in \"\" #49 (July 1986). The character in the comics was created as a \"super soldier\", intended to lead and inspire the troops while Cobra Commander remained in power. His creation involved Cobra collecting genetic material from various historical figures. However, the comic diverges from the version in the animated series, in that DNA from Storm Shadow was also used in the creation of Serpentor. He was also portrayed as having something akin to multiple personalities as a result of being created from the DNA of multiple tyrants. In another incident, he was able to access memories of one of his genetic forebears. He recalls the invention of pizza, informing a group of Dreadnoks.\n\nWhile his relationship in the comics was meant to be more of a figurehead, Serpentor was ambitious, leading to power struggles between him and other members of Cobra. Serpentor contended with Cobra Commander impostor Fred VII, and the two were often at odds. Their rivalry eventually escalated into the Cobra civil war, in which G.I. Joe was ordered to side with Serpentor to defeat the forces of Fred and the Baroness. During the conflict, Serpentor met his end at the hands of Zartan, and was killed by an arrow to the head (Memory recalled in issue #25), in \"G.I. Joe A Real American Hero\" #76 (September, 1988).\n\nDevil's Due continued the storyline of the Marvel series, and years after the events that led to Serpentor's death, his body was found and reanimated by renegade scientists. Soon a secretive faction called The Coil formed. Serpentor targeted G.I. Joe and Cobra forces alike.\n\nSerpentor in the \"G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers\" crossover published by Devil's Due Publishing has a very different origin. In the third \"G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers\" miniseries, the US government builds an android called \"Serpent OR\", using processors taken from Megatron and programmed with information on Earth and Cybertron's greatest war-leaders. Serpent OR, seeing himself as Megatron's son and heir, sets out on a quest to gain the Matrix for himself, believing it will grant him the power he needed to rule. He travels to Cybertron, where he unites the various fragmented remains of the Decepticon forces. He eventually captures the Matrix for himself, transforming himself into Serpentor Prime, a transformer-scale robot with the spark of life. This results in rethinking his strategy to conquer, but Cobra Commander takes over Serpentor Prime's body with a remote control device that was planted back on Earth. His rampage did not last long, as Hawk was able to open the Matrix, transforming Hawk into a mighty leader and rendering the Commander comatose. Serpent OR's exact fate beyond this is unknown.\n\nThe Official Transformer Fan Collectors Club's third Figure Subscription set included a human-made Transformer created by a former Cobra agent who sought to upload the data from the Serpentor project into the body of a deceased Sweep. However, as a result of an attack by the Earth Defense Command on this operation, the personality of Clayton \"Hawk\" Abernathy is added to Serpent O.R.'s programming, creating a Transformer known as Serpent O.R. with feelings of loyalty to Cobra, the Decepticons, AND the Earth Defense Command.\n\nIn the IDW continuity, Serpentor's real name is Stephen Minasian and he is the leader of the Coil, the religious wing of Cobra and a highly influential cult that is known to the public as a self-help group. The Coil worship a god named Golobulus (also called Gola-Bulas), who created a paradise called Cobra-La before human ignorance destroyed it. Serpentor claims to be the Final Disciple of Golobulus, a reincarnation of the best qualities of the god's previous champions such as Napoleon and Alexander the Great.\n\nSerpentor is a member of the Cobra Council, the ruling body that elects the Cobra Commander (who outranks Serpentor). In the case of a new Commander needing to be elected, Serpentor's view \"carries a ton of weight. If he is backing someone, then their stock will clearly go up in the eyes of the Cobra Court\". Serpentor isn't interested in becoming the new Commander and, during the contest to decide the new leader, starts assisting the Baroness, Major Bludd and Tomax in getting the role - that way, the eventual leader will \"need me\".\n\nSerpentor appears as the main antagonist in the second season of the original 1980s \"\" animated series. Serpentor first appeared in a five-part \"\" episode \"Arise, Serpentor, Arise!\", voiced by Richard Gautier. The animated version of Serpentor was designed to be a new, superior leader of Cobra created by Doctor Mindbender through a breakthrough in cloning research. He was conceived as the perfect warrior, extracted from the unearthed remains of some of the greatest generals of all time as well as other notable historic figures--Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, Attila the Hun, Philip II of Macedon and his son Alexander the Great, Ivan the Terrible, Vlad the Impaler, Hannibal, Genghis Khan, Grigori Rasputin, Montezuma, Geronimo, Eric the Red and Egyptian general Xanuth Amon-Toth. In the animated continuity, Sun Tzu's DNA was also intended to be part of Serpentor's creation, but the attempt to obtain his DNA was thwarted by Sgt. Slaughter, whose DNA was then intended for use as a substitute.\n\nThe first attempt to create Serpentor was sabotaged by Cobra Commander, who secretly dumped a mutant virus into the Sgt. Slaughter DNA chamber, causing a monster that rampaged throughout Cobra Island until it dissolved. During Doctor Mindbender's second attempt, Cobra Commander is betrayed by Scrap-Iron (who told Doctor Mindbender what had happened). Upon the recapture of Sgt. Slaughter, the creation is a success and Serpentor is born. As a result of Sun Tzu's DNA being missing, Serpentor is very intolerant and overbearing. He issues most of his orders with the phrase \"This I command!\" He also shows some of Slaughter's willingness to lead from the front lines, in contrast to Cobra Commander. Mere moments after his birth and being given his distinctive costume, he accepts a challenge from Slaughter, and the two battle throughout the Terror Drome, where Serpentor shows off the strength he inherited from Slaughter's DNA during the fight. However, without the methodical Sun Tzu's influence, Serpentor is also prone to impulsiveness, as shown in his first major act—leading Cobra in an attack upon Washington, D.C. He succeeded in capturing the city and demanded the surrender of the President (who was out of town with the Vice-President at the time), Congress and G.I. Joe. The G.I. Joe members managed a sneak attack on Cobra, turning the operation into a complete fiasco, but just as the Joes are about to capture Serpentor, a sudden burst of fire drives them back. It comes from Cobra Commander, who convinced Mindbender to free him, because he knew how to use a weapon. Cobra Commander convinced Serpentor to let him be his scapegoat since there would be no one to do the punishing for him.\n\nA later episode \"My Favorite Things\" reveals that Serpentor can assume the facial features of those whose DNA are included in his genetic composition. In addition, a few more donors to Serpentor's creation are revealed: a Viking warrior known as \"Ulrik the Batterer\", and the reptilian king \"Takshaka\" from Indian mythology.\n\nIn \"\", Serpentor is contacted by Pythona, an emissary of the ancient culture \"Cobra-La\". She informs him of the need to steal the Broadcast Energy Transmitter (B.E.T.). During the attack to obtain the B.E.T., Serpentor is wounded and left to be captured by G.I. Joe. Aided by Cobra-La, Cobra forces are later dispatched to rescue Serpentor and bring him to the hidden kingdom of Cobra-La. After Serpentor's arrival at the ancient kingdom, Cobra-La's supreme ruler Golobulus informs the Cobra leadership present that it was he who implanted the idea of creating Serpentor in Doctor Mindbender's brain with a biological organism called a \"psychic motivator\". Along with the other Cobra hierarchy, Serpentor accepts Golobulus's authority and vows to fulfill his goal of destroying human civilization. During an attack to acquire the B.E.T. from G.I. Joe headquarters, Serpentor severely injures Duke causing Duke to slip into a coma. During the climatic attack on Cobra-La, Serpentor is defeated by Duke's half-brother Lt. Falcon when the Cobra emperor's cape gets caught in his air chariot's engine turbine. Serpentor is last seen flying out of control on his air chariot, struggling to get himself free of his cape.\n\nSerpentor appeared in the DiC-produced \"\" miniseries, \"G.I. Joe: Operation Dragonfire\", voiced by Maurice LaMarche. He reorganizes Cobra with Destro, Baroness, Scoop, Zarana and Copperhead returning to the team. In the series, Serpentor attempted to harness the mythical power known as Dragonfire, but was unaware of Cobra Commander's return. In the ensuing civil war, Serpentor was captured by Cobra Commander and his Python Patrol. Cobra Commander then used his Pythonizing Ray made from a part of the Dragonfire he obtained to combine Serpentor with Gnawgahyde's pet iguana. Cobra Commander stated that the effects will be temporary and that by the time he changes back, he'll have a taste for flies. He was last seen running off into the jungle in his iguana form with Gnawgahyde chasing after him, Gnawgahyde threatening to barbecue Serpentor. Serpentor is not seen again in the DiC series, leaving it unclear if Serpentor successfully escaped or Gnawgahyde enacted his threats.\n\nIn \"\", Serpentor is the name of a giant cobra who belongs to Cobra Commander. Created by Doctor Mindbender as a gift to Cobra Commander, the Serpentor cobra possesses enough intelligence to follow basic commands and even swallow any human that angers Cobra Commander as well as spit them back out on cue if Cobra Commander decides to let that person live.\n\n"}

A multi-instrumentalist, he is credited with vocals, saxophone and composition. He is best known for songs such as \"It's Just Begun\", \"Bertha Butt Boogie\", and the biggest hit single, million-seller \"Troglodyte (Cave Man).\"\n\nCastor was born on January 23, 1940, Early in his career he was a member of the famous doo-wop group The Teenagers. Later he created Jimmy and the Juniors. In late 1966 he released \"Hey Leroy, Your Mama's Callin' You\". As solo artist and leader of The Jimmy Castor Bunch (TJCB) in the 1970s, Castor released several successful albums and singles. TJCB peaked their commercial success in 1972 upon the release of their album, \"It's Just Begun\", which featured two hit singles: the title track and \"Troglodyte (Cave Man)\", the latter of which became quite popular in the US, peaking at #6 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The track stayed on the chart for 14 weeks and on June 30, 1972, received a gold disc award from the RIAA for sales of a million copies. Castor released \"It's Just Begun\" in 1972. In 1973, he recorded a soprano saxophone instrumental cover of \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" written by Gary Brooker, Keith Reid and Matthew Fisher (from Procol Harum), on a tune inspired by J.S.Bach’s Orchestral Suite No. 3 BWV1068 in his \"Air on the G string”. Africa Bambaataa said that \"It's Just Begun\" was very popular at South Bronx block parties in the 1970s. Later popular songs included \"Bertha Butt Boogie\", \"Potential\", \"King Kong\" and \"A Groove Will Make You Move\" in 1975 and 1976.\n\nThe Jimmy Castor Bunch included keyboardist/trumpeter Gerry Thomas, bassist Doug Gibson, guitarist Harry Jensen, conga player Lenny Fridle, Jr., and drummer Bobby Manigault. Thomas also recorded with the Fatback Band, leaving TJCB in the 1980s to exclusively record with them.\n\nHe died from heart failure on January 16, 2012 in Henderson, Nevada, only a week short of his 72nd birthday.\n\nMany of the group's tunes have been heavily sampled in films and in hip-hop. In particular, the saxophone hook and groove from the title track of \"It's Just Begun\". For example Ice-T sampled the track for the title track of his 1988 album \"Power\". Also, heavy sampled is the spoken word intro and groove from \"Troglodyte (Cave Man)\" (namely, \"What we're gonna do right here is go back...\" and \"Gotta find a woman, gotta find a woman\"). Industrial hip hop group Tackhead covered the song \"Just Begun\" for the digital release of their album \"For the Love of Money\". \n\n\nNote: All credited to The Jimmy Castor Bunch unless otherwise stated.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2178155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2178155", "title": "Soul Train Music Awards", "text": "Soul Train Music Awards\n\nThe Soul Train Music Awards is an annual music awards show which previously aired in national television syndication, and honors the best in black music and entertainment. It is produced by the makers of \"Soul Train\", the program from which it takes its name, and features musical performances by various R&B and soul recording artists interspersed throughout the ceremonies. The special traditionally used to air in either February, March or April, but now airs the last weekend of November (in most years, Thanksgiving weekend).\n\nThe Soul Train Music Awards voting body includes active professionals in the fields of radio programming and music retail and management and recording artists with records that have charted in designated music trade publications in the year prior to proceedings. Past hosts for the show include such R&B luminaries as Luther Vandross, Dionne Warwick, Patti LaBelle, Will Smith, Vanessa Williams, Taraji P. Henson, and Gladys Knight.\n\nThe Soul Train Music Award trophy has featured an African ceremonial mask since its 1987 introduction. A new trophy was designed by Tristan Eaton of Thunderdog Studios in 2009 and is manufactured by New York firm Society Awards. From 1995 to 2005 a separate award show named Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards was held, honoring female artists.\n\nThe 2008 ceremonies were not held due to several factors, including the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike, the ill health of Don Cornelius at the time, and \"Soul Train\" distributor Tribune Entertainment terminating operations in the wake of the sale of Tribune Company to Sam Zell. With the rights to \"Soul Train\" acquired by MadVision Entertainment, the Soul Train Music Awards were presented on November 24, 2009 on Centric. MadVision now holds the rerun rights to \"Soul Train\".\n\nThe 2009 ceremony was held at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta, marking the first time in the show's 22-year history it was held outside of the Los Angeles area. The 2010 awards was held on November 10 just outside Atlanta at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, and aired November 28. The 2011 show was once again held in Atlanta and aired November 27. The 2012 ceremony was held live on November 25 at Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. As of 2019, Beyoncé is the most-awarded artist at the Soul Train Music Awards with 16 awards.\n\nThe original trophy is a bronze abstract sitting figure known as the Vanguard in 1987. However, the trophy is an African mask which is known as the Heritage Award. Its distinctive design created by an unknown sculptor, but its remains a visual trademark for Soul Train's representation of Black music.\n\nFrom 1989 to 2007, the Heritage mask remained the trophy for Soul Train Music Awards until 2009 when BET and its sister channel Centric revived the awards.

{"id": "2178164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2178164", "title": "Five-Year Plans of India", "text": "Five-Year Plans of India\n\nFrom 1947 to 2017, the Indian economy was premised on the concept of planning. This was carried through the Five-Year Plans, developed, executed, and monitored by the Planning Commission (1951-2014) and the NITI Aayog (2015-2017). With the prime minister as the ex-officio chairman, the commission has a nominated deputy chairman, who holds the rank of a cabinet minister. Montek Singh Ahluwalia is the last deputy chairman of the commission (resigned on 26 May 2014). The Twelfth Plan completed its term in March 2017. Prior to the Fourth Plan, the allocation of state resources was based on schematic patterns rather than a transparent and objective mechanism, which led to the adoption of the Gadgil formula in 1969. Revised versions of the formula have been used since then to determine the allocation of central assistance for state plans. The new government led by Narendra Modi, elected in 2014, has announced the dissolution of the Planning Commission, and its replacement by a think tank called the NITI Aayog (an acronym for National Institution for Transforming India).\n\nFive-Year Plans (FYPs) are centralized and integrated national economic programs. Joseph Stalin implemented the first Five-Year Plan in the Soviet Union in 1928. Most communist states and several capitalist countries subsequently have adopted them. China continues to use FYPs, although China renamed its Eleventh FYP, from 2006 to 2010, a guideline (\"guihua\"), rather than a plan (\"jihua\"), to signify the central government's more hands-off approach to development. India launched its First FYP in 1951, immediately after independence, under the socialist influence of India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nThe First Five-Year Plan was one of the most important, because it had a great role in the launching of Indian development after Independence. Thus, it strongly supported agriculture production and also launched the industrialization of the country (but less than the Second Plan, which focused on heavy industries). It built a particular system of mixed economy, with a great role for the public sector (with an emerging welfare state), as well as a growing private sector (represented by some personalities as those who published the Bombay Plan).\n\nThe first Indian prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, presented the First Five-Year Plan to the Parliament of India and needed urgent attention. The First Five-year Plan was launched in 1951 which mainly focused in development of the primary sector. The First Five-Year Plan was based on the Harrod–Domar model with few modifications.\n\nThe total planned budget of Rs.2069 crore (2378 crore later) was allocated to seven broad areas: irrigation and energy (27.2%), agriculture and community development (17.4%), transport and communications (24%), industry (8.4%), social services (16.6%), rehabilitation of landless farmers (4.1%), and for other sectors and services (2.5%). The most important feature of this phase was active role of state in all economic sectors. Such a role was justified at that time because immediately after independence, India was facing basic problems—deficiency of capital and low capacity to save.\n\nThe target growth rate was 2.1% annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth; the achieved growth rate was 3.6% the net domestic product went up by 15%. The monsoon was good and there were relatively high crop yields, boosting exchange reserves and the per capita income, which increased by 8%. National income increased more than the per capita income due to rapid population growth. Many irrigation projects were initiated during this period, including the Bhakra, Hirakud, Mettur Dam and Damodar Valley dams. The World Health Organization (WHO), with the Indian government, addressed children's health and reduced infant mortality, indirectly contributing to population growth.\n\nAt the end of the plan period in 1956, five Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) were started as major technical institutions. The University Grants Commission (UGC) was set up to take care of funding and take measures to strengthen the higher education in the country. Contracts were signed to start five steel plants, which came into existence in the middle of the Second Five-Year Plan. The plan was quasi-successful for the government.\n\nThe Second Plan focused on the development of the public sector and \"rapid Industrialisation\". The plan followed the Mahalanobis model, an economic development model developed by the Indian statistician Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis in 1953. The plan attempted to determine the optimal allocation of investment between productive sectors in order to maximise long-run economic growth. It used the prevalent state-of-the-art techniques of operations research and optimization as well as the novel applications of statistical models developed at the Indian Statistical Institute. The plan assumed a closed economy in which the main trading activity would be centred on importing capital goods.\n\nHydroelectric power projects and five steel plants at Bhilai, Durgapur, and Rourkela were established with the help of Russia, Britain (the U.K) and West Germany respectively. Coal production was increased. More railway lines were added in the north east.\n\nThe Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and Atomic Energy Commission of India were established as research institutes. In 1957, a talent search and scholarship program was begun to find talented young students to train for work in nuclear power.\n\nThe total amount allocated under the Second Five-Year Plan in India was Rs.48 billion. This amount was allocated among various sectors: power and irrigation, social services, communications and transport, and miscellaneous. The second plan was a period of rising prices. The country also faced foreign exchange crisis. The rapid growth in population slowed down the growth in the per capita income.\n\nThe target growth rate was 4.5% and the actual growth rate was 4.27%.\n\nThe plan was criticized by classical liberal economist B.R. Shenoy who noted that the plan's \"dependence on deficit financing to promote heavy industrialization was a recipe for trouble\". Shenoy argued that state control of the economy would undermine a young democracy. India faced an external payments crisis in 1957, which is viewed as confirmation of Shenoy's argument.\n\nThe Third Five-year Plan stressed agriculture and improvement in the production of wheat, but the brief Sino-Indian War of 1962 exposed weaknesses in the economy and shifted the focus towards the defence industry and the Indian Army. In 1965–1966, India fought a War with Pakistan. There was also a severe drought in 1965. The war led to inflation and the priority was shifted to price stabilisation. The construction of dams continued. Many cement and fertilizer plants were also built. Punjab began producing an abundance of wheat.\n\nMany primary schools were started in rural areas. In an effort to bring democracy to the grass-root level, Panchayat elections were started and the states were given more development responsibilities.\n\nState electricity boards and state secondary education boards were formed. States were made responsible for secondary and higher education. State road transportation corporations were formed and local road building became a state responsibility.\n\nThe target growth rate was 5.6%, but the actual growth rate was 2.4%.\n\nDue to miserable failure of the Third Plan the government was forced to declare \"plan holidays\" (from 1966–67, 1967–68, and 1968–69). Three annual plans were drawn during this intervening period. During 1966–67 there was again the problem of drought. Equal priority was given to agriculture, its allied activities, and industrial sector. The government of India declared \"Devaluation of Rupee\" to increase the exports of the country. The main reasons for plan holidays were the war, lack of resources and increase in inflation.\n\nAt this time Indira Gandhi was the prime minister. The Indira Gandhi government nationalised 14 major Indian banks and the Green Revolution in India advanced agriculture. In addition, the situation in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) was becoming dire as the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 and Bangladesh Liberation War took funds earmarked for industrial development. India also performed the Smiling Buddha underground nuclear test (Pokhran-1) in Rajasthan on May 18, 1974, partially in response to the United States deployment of the Seventh Fleet in the Bay of Bengal. The fleet had been deployed to warn India against attacking West Pakistan and extending the war.\n\nThe target growth rate was 5.6%, but the actual growth rate was 3.3%.\n\nThe Fifth Five-Year Plan laid stress on employment, poverty alleviation (Garibi Hatao), and justice. The plan also focused on self-reliance in agricultural production and defence. In 1978 the newly elected Morarji Desai government rejected the plan. The Electricity Supply Act was amended in 1975, which enabled the central government to enter into power generation and transmission.\n\nThe Indian national highway system was introduced and many roads were widened to accommodate the increasing traffic. Tourism also expanded. The twenty-point programme was launched in 1975. It was followed from 1974 to 1979.\n\nThe Minimum Needs Programme (MNP) was introduced in the first year of the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1974–78). The objective of the programme is to provide certain basic minimum needs and thereby improve the living standards of the people. It is prepared and launched by D.P.Dhar.\n\nThe target growth rate was 4.4% and the actual growth rate was 4.8%.\n\nThe Janata Party government rejected the Fifth Five-Year Plan and introduced a new Sixth Five-Year Plan (1978–1980). This plan was again rejected by the Indian National Congress government in 1980 and a new Sixth Plan was made. The Rolling Plan consisted of three kinds of plans that were proposed. The First Plan was for the present year which comprised the annual budget and the Second was a plan for a fixed number of years, which may be 3, 4 or 5 years.The Second Plan kept changing as per the requirements of the Indian economy. The Third Plan was a perspective plan for long terms i.e. for 10, 15 or 20 years. Hence there was no fixation of dates for the commencement and termination of the plan in the rolling plans. The main advantage of the rolling plans was that they were flexible and were able to overcome the rigidity of fixed Five-Year Plans by mending targets, the object of the exercise, projections and allocations as per the changing conditions in the country's economy. The main disadvantage of this plan was that if the targets were revised each year, it became difficult to achieve the targets laid down in the five-year period and it turned out to be a complex plan. Also, the frequent revisions resulted in the lack of stability in the economy.\n\nThe Sixth Five-Year Plan marked the beginning of economic liberalisation. Price controls were eliminated and ration shops were closed. This led to an increase in food prices and an increase in the cost of living. This was the end of Nehruvian socialism. The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development was\nestablished for development of rural areas on 12 July 1982 by recommendation of the Shivaraman Committee. \nFamily planning was also expanded in order to prevent overpopulation. In contrast to China's strict and binding one-child policy, Indian policy did not rely on the threat of force . More prosperous areas of India adopted family planning more rapidly than less prosperous areas, which continued to have a high birth rate. Military Five-Year Plans became coterminous with Planning Commission's plans from this plan onwards.\n\nThe Sixth Five-Year Plan was a great success to the Indian economy. The target growth rate was 5.2% and the actual growth rate was 5.7%. The only Five-Year Plan which was done twice.\n\nThe Seventh Five-Year Plan was led by the Congress Party with Rajiv Gandhi as the prime minister. The plan laid stress on improving the productivity level of industries by upgrading of technology.\n\nThe main objectives of the Seventh Five-Year Plan were to establish growth in areas of increasing economic productivity, production of food grains, and generating employment through \"Social Justice\".\n\nAs an outcome of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, there had been steady growth in agriculture, controls on the rate of inflation, and favourable balance of payments which had provided a strong base for the Seventh Five-Year Plan to build on the need for further economic growth. The Seventh Plan had strived towards socialism and energy production at large. The thrust areas of the Seventh Five-Year Plan were: social justice, removal of oppression of the weak, using modern technology, agricultural development, anti-poverty programmes, full supply of food, clothing, and shelter, increasing productivity of small- and large-scale farmers, and making India an independent economy.\n\nBased on a 15-year period of striving towards steady growth, the Seventh Plan was focused on achieving the prerequisites of self-sustaining growth by the year 2000. The plan expected the labour force to grow by 39 million people and employment was expected to grow at the rate of 4% per year.\n\nSome of the expected outcomes of the Seventh Five-Year Plan India are given below:\n\n\nUnder the Seventh Five-Year Plan, India strove to bring about a self-sustained economy in the country with valuable contributions from voluntary agencies and the general populace.\n\nThe target growth rate was 5.0% and the actual growth rate was 6.01%. and the growth rate of per capita income was 3.7%.\n\nThe Eighth Plan could not take off in 1990 due to the fast changing economic situation at the centre and the years 1990–91 and 1991–92 were treated as Annual Plans. The Eighth Plan was finally formulated for the period 1992–1997.\n\n1989–91 was a period of economic instability in India and hence no Five-Year Plan was implemented. Between 1990 and 1992, there were only Annual Plans. In 1991, India faced a crisis in foreign exchange (forex) reserves, left with reserves of only about 1 billion. Thus, under pressure, the country took the risk of reforming the socialist economy. P.V. Narasimha Rao was the ninth prime minister of the Republic of India and head of Congress Party, and led one of the most important administrations in India's modern history, overseeing a major economic transformation and several incidents affecting national security. At that time Dr. Manmohan Singh (later prime minister of India) launched India's free market reforms that brought the nearly bankrupt nation back from the edge. It was the beginning of liberalization, privatisation and globalization (LPG) in India.\n\nModernization of industries was a major highlight of the Eighth Plan. Under this plan, the gradual opening of the Indian economy was undertaken to correct the burgeoning deficit and foreign debt. Meanwhile, India became a member of the World Trade Organization on 1 January 1995. The major objectives included, controlling population growth, poverty reduction, employment generation, strengthening the infrastructure, institutional building, tourism management, human resource development, involvement of Panchayati rajs, Nagar Palikas, NGOs, decentralisation and people's participation.\n\nEnergy was given priority with 26.6% of the outlay.\n\nThe target growth rate was 5.6% and the actual growth rate was 6.8%.\n\nTo achieve the target of an average of 5.6% per annum, investment of 23.2% of the gross domestic product was required. The incremental capital ratio is 4.1. The saving for investment was to come from domestic sources and foreign sources, with the rate of domestic saving at 21.6% of gross domestic production and of foreign saving at 1.6% of gross domestic production.\n\nThe Ninth Five-Year Plan came after 50 years of Indian Independence. Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the prime minister of India during the Ninth Plan. The Ninth Plan tried primarily to use the latent and unexplored economic potential of the country to promote economic and social growth. It offered strong support to the social spheres of the country in an effort to achieve the complete elimination of poverty. The satisfactory implementation of the Eighth Five-Year Plan also ensured the states' ability to proceed on the path of faster development. The Ninth Five-Year Plan also saw joint efforts from the public and the private sectors in ensuring economic development of the country. In addition, the Ninth Five-Year Plan saw contributions towards development from the general public as well as governmental agencies in both the rural and urban areas of the country. New implementation measures in the form of Special Action Plans (SAPs) were evolved during the Ninth Plan to fulfill targets within the stipulated time with adequate resources. The SAPs covered the areas of social infrastructure, agriculture, information technology and Water policy.\n\nBudget\n\nThe Ninth Five-Year Plan had a total public sector plan outlay of . The Ninth Five-Year Plan also saw a hike of 48% in terms of plan expenditure and 33% in terms of the plan outlay in comparison to that of the Eighth Five-Year Plan. In the total outlay, the share of the center was approximately 57% while it was 43% for the states and the union territories.\n\nThe Ninth Five-Year Plan focused on the relationship between the rapid economic growth and the quality of life for the people of the country. The prime focus of this plan was to increase growth in the country with an emphasis on social justice and equity. The Ninth Five-Year Plan placed considerable importance on combining growth oriented policies with the mission of achieving the desired objective of improving policies which would work towards the improvement of the poor in the country. The Ninth Plan also aimed at correcting the historical inequalities which were still prevalent in the society.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe main objective of the Ninth Five-Year Plan was to correct historical inequalities and increase the economic growth in the country. Other aspects which constituted the Ninth Five-Year Plan were:\n\nStrategies\n\nPerformance\n\nThe Ninth Five-Year Plan looks through the past weaknesses in order to frame the new measures for the overall socio-economic development of the country. However, for a well-planned economy of any country, there should be a combined participation of the governmental agencies along with the general population of that nation. A combined effort of public, private, and all levels of government is essential for ensuring the growth of India's economy.\n\nThe target growth was 7.1% and the actual growth was 6.8%.\n\nThe main objectives of the Tenth Five-Year Plan:\n\nOut of total plan outlay, (57.9%) was for central government and (42.1%) was for states and union territories.\n\n\nThe Twelfth Five-Year Plan of the Government of India has been decided to achieve a growth rate of 8.2% but the National Development Council (NDC) on 27 December 2012 approved a growth rate of 8% for the Twelfth Plan.\n\nWith the deteriorating global situation, the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia has said that achieving an average growth rate of 9 percent in the next five years is not possible.\nThe Final growth target has been set at 8% by the endorsement of the plan at the National Development Council meeting held in New Delhi.\n\n\"It is not possible to think of an average of 9% [in the Twelfth Plan]. I think somewhere between 8 and 8.5 percent is feasible,\" Ahluwalia said on the sidelines of a conference of State Planning Boards and departments. The approached paper for the Twelfth Plan, approved last year, talked about an annual average growth rate of 9%.\n\n\"When I say feasible... that will require major effort. If you don't do that, there is no God given right to grow at 8 percent. I think given that the world economy deteriorated very sharply over the last year...the growth rate in the first year of the 12th Plan (2012–13) is 6.5 to 7 percent.\"\n\nHe also indicated that soon he should share his views with other members of the Commission to choose a final number (economic growth target) to put before the country's NDC for its approval.\n\nThe government intends to reduce poverty by 10% during the 12th Five-Year Plan. Ahluwalia said, \"We aim to reduce poverty estimates by 9% annually on a sustainable basis during the Plan period\".\nEarlier, addressing a conference of State Planning Boards and Planning departments, he said the rate of decline in poverty doubled during the Eleventh Plan. The commission had said, while using the Tendulkar poverty line, the rate of reduction in the five years between 2004–05 and 2009–10, was about 1.5% points each year, which was twice that when compared to the period between 1993–95 to 2004–05.\nThe plan aims towards the betterment of the infrastructural projects of the nation avoiding all types of bottlenecks. The document presented by the planning commission is aimed to attract private investments of up to US$1 trillion in the infrastructural growth in the 12th five-year plan, which will also ensure a reduction in the subsidy burden of the government to 1.5 percent from 2 percent of the GDP (gross domestic product). The UID (Unique Identification Number) will act as a platform for cash transfer of the subsidies in the plan.\n\nThe objectives of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan were:\n\nWith the Planning Commission dissolved, no more formal plans are made for the economy, but Five-Year Defence Plans continue to be made. The latest is 2017–2022. There will be no Thirteenth Five-Year Plan.\n\n\n"}

Kokkinos was born in Melbourne and prior to her career in film, she worked as an industrial lawyer. Kokkinos has since directed three feature-length films and two short films. She has won numerous awards for her films. Kokkinos has also directed television shows such as \"The Secret Life of Us\" and \"The Time of Our Lives\".\n\n\"The Guardian\" wrote, of her work: \"Kokkinos's cinematic oeuvre is among the most hard-hitting bodies of work in Australian cinema.\"\n\nIn 1991, she was accepted into the Victorian College of the Arts' graduate film and television programme.\n\nKokkinos' career began with a short black and white film she directed while in her first year of film school, \"Antamosi\" (1992), which examines a migrant family's relationship which is told from the perspective of three generations of women. Coming from a Greek immigrant family herself, Kokkinos's work often deals with themes of identity and family. \n\nHer next film was the 50-minute short feature \"Only The Brave\" (1994), which won several awards. This film follows Alex as he helplessly watches his best friend Vicki fall victim to her self-destructive tendencies.\n\nIn her feature-length work, \"Head On\" (1998), Kokkinos explores the relationship between the city and the individual. Similar to a \"road movie\" (i.e. \"Mad Max\", 1979) where the narrative follows the protagonists journey to their destination, a \"street movie\" follows the protagonist as they wander urban streets. \"Head On\" follows Greek-Australian teenager Ari as he wanders the streets of Melbourne. Ari is struggling with his identity as a gay male and the identity his family wishes to thrust upon him.\n\n\"Head On\" divided the Greek community in Australia Kokkinos said in an interview with the \"LA Times\". Kokkinos said \"what it did is that it opened up a dialogue between younger Greeks and their parents. What the film has done is that it has broken down barriers.\" \n\nThe film was adapted from the novel \"Loaded\" which was written by Christos Tsiolkas. \"Head On\" received numerous awards from around the globe including Best First Feature in the San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival as well as Best Film at the Milan International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival.\n\nHer next film \"The Book of Revelation\" (2006) was also adapted form a novel of the same name written by Rupert Thomson. This film continues the street movie theme developed in \"Head On\". In \"The Book of Revelation\" the main protagonist, Daniel, leaves his house to buy cigarettes but is abducted by three masked women who then subject him to physical and emotional abuse. The women also repeatedly rape Daniel. \"The Book of Revelation\" was nominated by the Australian Film Institute for Best Screenplay.\n\nKokkinos's most recent film was \"Blessed\" (2009). The film deals with the complex relationship between mother and child and occurs during the span of 24 hours. \"Blessed\" was nominated by the Australian Film Institute for Best Adapted Screenplay in 2009.\n\nKokkinos realized she was gay at the age of 15. In an interview with the \"LA Times\" she said, \"I went through a very long process of having to come to terms with that, and that wasn't easy, but I don't think it's easy for anyone.\" \n\nAlthough Kokkinos identifies as a lesbian, she rejects the tag \"lesbian filmmaker.\" In the same \"LA Times\" interview she said, \"I have the capacity to represent all kinds of characters on screen and tell a variety of stories with all kinds of characters in a compelling and interesting way for the broadest possible audience.\" \n\n\"Anatamosi\" (1992)\n\n\"Only the Brave\" (1994)\n\n\"Head On\" (1998)\n\n\"The Book of Revelation\" (2006)\n\n\"Blessed\" (2009)\n\n\"The Hunting\" (2019 TV mini-series)\n\n"}
{"id": "2178173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2178173", "title": "Plaza de Toros de Ronda", "text": "Plaza de Toros de Ronda\n\nThe Plaza de Toros de Ronda is a Bullring in Ronda, it has a diameter of , surrounded by a passage formed by two rings of stone. There are two layers of seating, each with five raised rows and 136 pillars that make up 68 arches. The Royal Box has a sloping roof covered in Arabic tiles. The design of the main entrance to the bull ring features two Tuscan columns and the royal shield of Spain surround by baroque edging. The main door is large enough to allow horses and carriages to enter the ring, and above the door is an iron wrought balcony that embodies the bullfighting culture. \n\nThe city of Ronda is home to the Real Maestranza de Caballería, the oldest and most noble order of horsemanship in Spain since 1485. In that year, the Catholic King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella won Ronda back from the Moors and ended over seven centuries of Islamic rule. Construction of the bullring started in 1779 and finished in 1785. It stands on the west edge of Ronda, about two blocks from Puente Nuevo and the \"El Tajo\" canyon. \nThe design is attributed to the architect Martín de Aldehuela. While it may not be the oldest bull fighting ring in Spain, it is one of the first entirely constructed from stone, instead of a combination of stone and brick. The architecture is also unique in that all seating in the ring is covered. It is considered a rather small arena with only five thousand seats, but the bull ring itself is the largest in Spain. Ronda's first inaugural bull fighting event in May of 1784 resulted in a partial collapse of the stands, and the structure had to be closed temporarily for repairs. It reopened the next year in May of 1785 with its second inaugural event, which is known as one of the greatest bullfights in Ronda's history. Rivals Pedro Romero and Pepe Hillo faced each other in front of the most noble families in Ronda.\n\nIn 1923, the original Espinel theater in Ronda was built next to the main entrance of the Plaza de Toros de Ronda. Subsequently the entrance was relocated to Virgen de la Paz, where it still stands across from a restaurant named after the famous Pedro Romero. Later, in the 1980s, the old Espinel theater was demolished and relocated, and it gave way to a parking lot. In 2009, that parking lot was finally removed and the city of Ronda opened up a competition for designers to construct new gardens next to the entrance of the bullfighting ring. Some historians argued that the entrance should be restored in its original locations, but today gardens that embody the golden era of bullfighting in Spain now stretch to a scenic outlook next to the ring.\n\nSoon after the ring's creation in the 18th century, the Romero family of Ronda emerged to provide over three generations of bullfighters. The most important of them was Pedro Romero (1754-1839), a key figure in the history of bullfighting who slew more than 5,600 bulls. The Romero and Ordóñez families were known for their great bullfights in the Plaza, and bronze statues of Cayetano Ordóñez and son Antonio Ordóñez stand outside one of the entrances to the bullring. Ordoñez created the Feria Goyesca, a bullfight held the first week of September every year in honor of Pedro Romero. The Ordoñez family, widely considered the second bullfighting dynasty of Ronda, participates in the spectacle along with the bullfighters and their assistants. They dress up in costumes reminiscent of the characters in paintings by Spanish romantic painter Francisco Goya.\n\nBecause of its rural location and the small size of the surrounding town of Ronda, this bullring does not host as many bullfights as other, larger venues: Seville for example. The bullring in Ronda is open to the public, charging a small admission fee.\n\nThe bullring also houses a museum dedicated to the spectacle. The Museo Taurino holds two centuries of famous bullfighting regalia and important outfits. The collection also includes an extensive amount of weapons used by the Real Maestranza in Spanish war. The museum is open all year expect the week of the Feria in September, and costs 6.5 euros to enter.\nIn 1994, US singer Madonna shot her music video for \"Take A Bow\" in the bullfight arena, and planned to invite fans to take part as extras, but just before shooting, that plan was discarded. Madonna's co-star in the video was Spanish bullfighter Emilio Muñoz, who played her Latin lover who leaves her after spending a passionate night with the heartbroken blonde. In 2001, the bullring was the location of the final quiz and execution in the first season of the U.S. reality TV show \"The Mole\", hosted by Anderson Cooper.\n\n"}

He is best known for his IMSA GT Championship and SCCA Trans-Am Series career.\n\nSon of race driver Charles Kendall, Kendall began his racing career competing at the IMSA GT Championship. He drove a Mazda RX-7 in the GTU category while studying and by the time he completed his studies, he took the 1986 and 1987 championships. Later he won three other titles in the same car, which he still owns.\n\nHe later dominated the SCCA Trans-Am Series in the 1990s, scoring four series championships. His greatest year came in 1997, when he won 11 races in a row out of the 13 on the schecule—almost a perfect season. During this time, Kendall was also honored by representing the series for six IROC seasons.\n\nHe ran in fourteen NASCAR Cup Series races between 1987 and 1998. He raced primarily only on road courses as a road course ringer, and scored one Top-10 finish. He nearly won the 1991 Banquet Frozen Foods 300K at Sears Point Raceway, in which he led 12 laps before cutting a tire with two laps to go following a late-race collision with Mark Martin. The two drivers, who were briefly Roush-Fenway Racing teammates in Trans-Am, would not speak about the incident for years until they rehashed their late-race collision on Martin's podcast, twenty years later.\n\nWhile competing in Winston Cup as a ringer, Kendall had a single start in the NASCAR Busch Series. Kendall also had one start with Dick Johnson Racing at the 1996 AMP Bathurst 1000 in Australia co-driving with Steven Johnson, the son of team boss Dick Johnson. Johnson and Kendall finished 8th in their Ford EF Falcon. Of the American drivers who have competed in the Bathurst 1000 since the race moved to Bathurst in 1963 including three time Indianapolis 500 winner Johnny Rutherford, Janet Guthrie (the first woman to ever qualify for the Indy 500 in 1977), Dick Barbour, Sam Posey, Bob Tullius, John Andretti and Scott Pruett, Kendall holds the distinction of being the first one to have ever finished the race (Pruett in his only start would finish 11th the next year at Bathurst).\n\nOn June 30, 1991, Kendall suffered serious leg injuries at Watkins Glen when a mechanical failure caused his Intrepid RM-1 IMSA GTP car to leave the track and crash head-on into a tire wall. This occurred along the same area of track where J. D. McDuffie of NASCAR Winston Cup fame was killed only a month later, and both crashes led to the addition of a bus stop chicane on the backstretch. Kendall spoke of this incident during Episode 4, Season 2 of the Speed Channel series, \"Setup\" as a \"crossroads in his racing career.\" He returned to racing over a year later in August 1992. He also discussed his accident on \"Athlete 360\", a sports medicine television show hosted by Mark Adickes.\n\nIn the 2000s Kendall became a television analyst for the Champ Car series. He is also the host of the Speed Test Drive promotional television series where he and another professional race car driver drive a new vehicle on a race course while being able to remotely talk to each other and offer their positive thoughts on the car.\n\nIn 2007 and 2008, Kendall was one of the hosts of the show \"Setup\" on SpeedTV.\n\nOn July 15, 2012, Kendall revealed on SpeedTV's \"WindTunnel\" program that he would be returning to the cockpit as one of four full-time drivers in a factory-backed Dodge Viper effort competing in the American Le Mans Series.\n\nOn September 22, 2013, Kendall's new show, \"Driven - A Race Without Boundaries\", premiered on Fox Sports 1. It also stars Rhys Millen and is hosted by Tiff Needell.\n\nKendall was raised in the city of La Cañada Flintridge, California and is a 1984 graduate of La Cañada High School.\n\nKendall earned a degree in economics from UCLA and to this day maintains an avid interest in business.\n\nIn 2015, he was inducted in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America.\n\n"}
{"id": "2178176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2178176", "title": "Jute trade", "text": "Jute trade\n\nThe jute trade is centered mainly around India and the Indian State of West Bengal. The major producing country of jute is India, due to its natural fertile soil. Bengal Jute was exported to South East Asia from the 17th century by the Dutch, French and later by other Europeans. \n\nBy the 1790s a small export had developed to the Scottish city of Dundee, where the flax spinning industry could use a small percentage to lower costs. \n\nThomas Neigh, a Dundee merchant invented the mechanical process of spinning jute in 1833 by first soaking it in whale oil.\n\nRaw jute was exported from Bengal by British merchants in increasing quantities from the 1840s replacing flax in the Dundee mills – becoming known as \"Juteopolis\".\n\nDundee became the global centre of the industry it had created, employing more than half the population in the mills. \n\nThe mill owners creatively developed new markets for the jute goods, principally sacks, worldwide. \n\nIn 1858 Indian financiers supported the importation of spinning machinery from Dundee in order to create their own industry. The Indian jute barons were able to pay workers less and gradually began to take over. Dundee had better access to European markets and the mills did not completely collapse until the 1960s. \n\nBecause The Indian Empire had no tariff barriers with other British countries Dundee was bound to fail despite superior quality and working standards.\nBy 1895 jute industries in Bengal overtook the Scottish jute trade. Many Scots worked in Bengal to set up jute factories for Indians, dominated by Marwari brokers like G. D. Birla.\n\nJute coffee bags are perhaps the most famous product, known as Hessian or burlap. They found a military use starting in the Crimean War. In World War One the government awarded the entire contract for sandbags to a Greek-Indian firm in Calcutta.\n\nIt has been used in the fishing, construction, art and in the arms industry. India has the bulk of the Jute industry (60%), but the raw jute comes mainly from Bangladesh which is the second-largest producer of jute products. \n\nNearly 75% of jute goods are used as packaging materials, burlap, gunny cloth, (hessian), and sacks. Obsolete machinery, trade union troubles and a lack of innovation have seen the Indian industry stagnate for the past 70 years.\n\nCarpet backing cloth, the third major jute outlet, is fast growing in importance. Currently, it consists of roughly 15% of the world's jute goods consumption. The remaining products are carpet yarn, cordage, felts, padding, twine, ropes, decorative fabrics, and heavy-duty miscellaneous items for industrial use.\n\nAs plastic is banned for consumer bagging, jute bags are now taking a greater share of the market. India produces 60% of global jute products, however, problems of lack of investment, water shortage, poor quality seeds and urbanisation are hampering its regrowth as a replacement for plastic.\n\nJute has been grown in the East Bengal region for centuries. It was produced for domestic consumption in the villages of present-day Bangladesh and West Bengal. \n\nJute was used for rope production until the modern era, but the creation of the Jute Industry led to the collapse of Indian handloom jute in the 1880s. In the 1850s roughly £250,000 of jute products were exported annually.\n\nJute was an export material demanded by South East Asia which was fulfilled by Indian and European trading firms.\n\nThe modern jute industry was not invented until 1833 in Dundee, but small quantities were used in flax and hemp spinning after 1790. \n\nBy the early part of the twentieth century, there were huge increases of finished jute exports and a massive reduction in the export of raw jute. India was gaining around £35 million per annum from processed goods, with only £8m earned by sales of raw jute to Brazil, New York, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom.\n\nPartition meant that 75% of the Jute growing areas were in Pakistan, but all 106 mills, the baling centres and export hubs were in India. Jute was the subject of the first inter-Dominion agreement, however, the devaluation of the Indian rupee and Pakistani demands for a share of the export tariff led to break downs.\n\n250,000 workers were directly employed in the industry, supporting 4 million peasants and providing 20% of India's foreign earnings. Despite this, a long depression ensued due to the politics involved and the oligopolistic practice of the Indian Jute Mills Association.\n\nThe long depression in Jute is partly attributed to the exploitation by the Indian Jute barons who only pursued short term profit after purchasing the British invented and developed mills. Jute mills continue to close, 8 in the last few years, down to 55. Migrant workers have left the state, wages have not increased and strikes have been commonplace.\n\nThe British East India Company was the British Empire Authority delegated in Bengal from the 17th century until dissolved in 1857. The Dutch and the French were the first jute traders.\n\nThe company began exporting gunny sacks to South East Asiam during the seventeenth and eighteenth century. \n\nIn the 1830s Thomas Neigh imported jute to Dundee and experimented using flax spinning machines to make cloth. This was not initially successful, but used as a small mixture with flax until they discovered that whale oil made it soft enough to be spun. \n\nDemand for jute skyrocketed as its uses in sacks, ropes, and cloth displaced flax. \n\nBetween 1833 and 1855, Bengal saw a boom in growing jute, but a decline in its cottage hand spinning. \n\nIn 1855 a George Auckland was financed by Bysamber Sen to import Dundee fabric spinning machinery (and whale oil) to start the first factory in India at Serampore. \n\nAlthough a failure, he inspired the Borneo Company to start a steam-powered weaving and spinning mill. \n\nWhereon a dozen companies began producing for domestic Indian use and export to the east. \n\nBy 1908 Calcutta was the world's largest jute producer having defeated Dundee. From the 1890s the Marwaris had entered the market as brokers (like the Birla group) and became the dominant owners of an industry employing over 300,000 workers. \nBeing a major player in the long history of jute trade and having finest natural fibre, Bangladesh has always had an advantage in raw jute trading. Bangladesh is still the largest producer and exporter of raw jute in the world. After the separation of Bangladesh (East Pakistan) from Pakistan in 1971, the jute trading was not limited to specific groups like India or Pakistan. After the independence of Bangladesh, most privately owned jute mills were nationalised under the socialist policies of the Awami League government.\n\nLater, to control these jute mils in Bangladesh, the government built up Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC). No other jute mills were allowed to grow in the private sector before 1975. After Ziaur Rahman became Bangladesh president a new age dawned upon the Bangladesh jute industry. This incident grew many raw jute traders from different corners of Bangladesh who used to supply raw jute to BJMC owned jute mills. This group of traders are called Beparis, who buy raw jute directly from the farmers.\n\nBangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC), a public corporation in Bangladesh, is the largest state owned manufacturing and exporting organisation in the world in the jute sector.\n\nBJMC owns and operates a number of jute mills around Bangladesh:\n\nBJMC also operates mills that do not deal in jute, including Galfra Habib Ltd., Mills Furnishing Ltd. and Jute-Fibre Glass Industry.\nJute cultivation and jute trade in Bangladesh are sectors where significant incidence of child labour has been observed and recorded in the 2014 TVPRA List issued by the Bureau of International Labor Affairs.\n\nThe entrepreneurs of the Dundee jute industry in Scotland were called \"the Jute Barons\". \n\nDundee was a centre of flax spinning and the whale oil industry. They realised that jute could be mechanically spun if whale oil was added. \n\nThey created a huge new industry making bags for the transport of goods like coffee and as sandbags.\n\nThe Dundee jute industry started to decline when the machinery manufacturers sold the machinery to Indian merchants who benefitted from easier access to raw materials and lower pay.\n\nThis is a famous example of free trade in which the liberal government was elected to not enact trade barriers allowing the Calcutta industry to win. \n\nGiven that the \"Dundee Jute Barons\" had ownership stakes in Calcutta and Dundee, the decline in Scotland was not so burdensome on them. Over 50% of the workers in Dundee were in Jute and two-thirds were women, much of the remainder were children because they could be paid less. \n\nThe boom had led to slums, over crowding, poor working conditions and low pay. \nThe Indian Jute Mills Association is the apex body controlling the Indian trade.\n\nBirla is the most famous business giant in India which began as a Jute broker.\n\nThe Birla family is Marwari along with Mittal and Bajaj. Indian Jute is considered to be dominated by Marwari.\n\nThe industry has faced considerable trouble, for example, a mill owner was murdered by his workers in 2015 when he proposed cutting down hours. 6 such murders have occurred in recent years. \n\nThe Jute Industry in India depends on government purchase. Since the millennium government procurement for mandatory packaging in jute has decreased and is only now being reversed - at the consumer level – by the plastic ban. \n\nAfter liberation from the British, East Bengal with possessing the finest jute fibre stock, lacked an effective industrialised jute manufacturing. Several groups of Pakistani families (mainly from West Pakistan) came into the jute industrialisation business by setting up several jute mills in Chittagong, Khulna, Dhaka and Narayanganj.\n\nAmong these families, the most significant ones are:\n\n\nSultan Hafeez Rahman, 1984, Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS), Dhaka, Bangladesh.\nIndian Central Committee, Calcutta, India, 1940.\nK H Imam, Bulletin of the Oxford University, Institute of Economics and Statistics, Vol. 32 No.1 (Feb. 1970)\nPakistan Economic Journal, Vol.11 No.4 (Sept. 1961)\n\n"}

In February 1113, Fulk V and Henry I met near Alençon where they entered into a treaty of peace which was secured by the betrothal of Henry's son William Adelin and Fulk's daughter Matilda. The young couple were married in June 1119.\n\nOn the evening of 25 November 1120, returning from Normandy to England, William chose to sail aboard the \"White Ship\" and subsequently drowned when that ship sank in the English Channel just outside Barfleur harbor. Matilda had avoided the disaster, as passage for her had been arranged aboard another ship, presumably the one that her father-in-law was traveling on. His death left her a widow with no immediate heir to the throne of England and thus ended the treaty with Anjou.\n\nOn his return from Jerusalem, , Fulk V demanded the return of Matilda's dowry, comprising castles and towns in Maine, to which Henry flatly refused. After months of fruitless quarreling Fulk was considering warring on Henry once more. Finally, Fulk countered Henry by marrying his other daughter, Sibylla, to William Clito, the son of Robert Curthose, Henry's nephew and rival for Normandy. Fulk dowered the couple with the lordship of Maine.\n\nMeanwhile, after her husband's death Matilda remained at Henry's court and was treated as one of the king's daughters. Henry maintained she could remain as long as she wished and intended to marry her to one of his great nobles, \"heaping on her wealth and honours which would have raised her above all her family.\" She remained in England for several years, unmarried, but according to Orderic, wishing to see her parents and home, she returned to Anjou. After a time in Anjou she took the advice of Geoffrey, Bishop of Chartres and in 1128 she took her vows at Fontevrault Abbey as a nun. In 1150 she became the Abbess and died in 1154.\n\n<br>\n"}

The requirement may also be waived for any person unable to understand or communicate an understanding of said Oath due to a physical disability or mental impairment.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War, oaths of allegiance were administered to officers of the Continental Army, pursuant to a Congressional resolution of February 3, 1778. An example appears below.\n\nThe Oath of Allegiance for prospective citizens originated with the Naturalization Act of 1790, which required applicants to take an oath or affirmation \"to support the constitution of the United States\", but did not provide a text. The Naturalization Act of 1795 added renunciation of the new citizen's former sovereign to the oath. The Naturalization Act of 1906 added the section of the oath requiring new citizens to defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; and bear true faith and allegiance to the same.\n\nThe Oath acquired a standard text in 1929. Prior to then, spoken oaths were adapted from naturalization law, and each court could develop its own procedures for administering the oath.\n\nThe Internal Security Act of 1950 added the text about bearing arms and performing noncombatant service in the armed forces of the United States. The section about performing work of national importance under civilian direction was added by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.\n\nThe current exact text of the Oath of Citizenship is established only in the form of an administrative regulation promulgated by the executive branch. Under the Administrative Procedure Act, CIS could theoretically change the text of the oath at any time, so long as the new text reasonably meets the \"five principles\" mandated by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1953. These principles are:\n\n\nThere has been some controversy about the wording of the oath, parts of which are based on the British Oath of Supremacy which was written in the 16th Century. As a result, some have suggested much of the language is antiquated and confusing. In the fall of 2003, CIS planned to change the oath of citizenship in time for Citizenship Day (September 17). The proposed oath was as follows:\n\nThe introduction of the new oath was scrapped by the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security, and Claims on April 1, 2004.\n\nIn \"United States v. Schwimmer\" (1929), the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the denial of citizenship to an applicant who declared not to be willing to \"take up arms personally\" in defense of the United States. The applicant, Hungarian-born female suffragist Rosika Schwimmer, had written that she was an \"uncompromising pacifist\" with \"no sense of nationalism, only a cosmic consciousness of belonging to the human family\". The Court found that persons holding such views were \"liable to be incapable of the attachment for and devotion to the principles of our Constitution\" that are required for naturalization.\n\nEnglish writer Aldous Huxley, author of \"Brave New World\", applied for U.S. citizenship in 1953 after having lived in the United States for fourteen years. When asked if he would bear arms and perform noncombatant military service as required by the Oath, Huxley answered in the negative and was summoned before a judge. Huxley explained that his objection was based on philosophical convictions about the evil of war rather than religious beliefs. The judge adjourned proceedings and postponed a decision on Huxley's application in order to report to Washington. Huxley never received U.S. citizenship.\n\nIn the 1968 case \"In re Weitzman\", a U.S. district court considered the naturalization petition of Brenda Weitzman, a 25-year-old mother of two children from South Africa and religious non-believer who had refused to take the part of the Oath requiring her to serve in the Armed Forces. She expressed a total \"objection to warfare and the bearing of arms\" (conscientious objectorship), being \"repulsed by no particular war, but by all killing.\" The court, finding that her stance was \"based on a personal moral code and not on religious training and belief\" and that she did not recognize anything \"tantamount to a God or a Supreme Being\", denied her petition.\n\nThe precedent relied upon was \"United States v. Seeger\" (1965). However, in \"Welsh v. United States\" (1970), the Supreme Court, having noted the case factually similar and controlled by \"United States v. Seeger\", determined in respect to the provision in the Universal Military Training and Service Act that exempts from military service persons who by reason of \"religious training and belief\" are conscientiously opposed to war, that the Act:\n\nThis judgement was used in 2013 to reverse a denial of citizenship to Margaret Doughty, a 65 year old British atheist who had lived in the United States for 30 years, unless she could show proof of membership in a church with pacifist beliefs to support her claim that she was a conscientious objector entitled to omit the Oath's clause about bearing arms. The USCIS retracted their demand after receiving a letter from an atheist group that objected based on \"Welsh vs. United States\".\n\n"}

Schumacher carried out significant research work in malacology, in other words on molluscs, and assigned systematic names to many taxa.\n\nHe was born to Joachim Christian Schumacher, a sergeant in the infantry of the Duchy of Schleswig, and his wife, Caroline Magdalene in Glückstadt in present-day Germany. In spite of his family's limited means, he received a good upbringing, and was sent to grammar school in Rendsburg. After confirmation became the apprentice of the regiment surgeon, Mehl, a learned and skilled man, who gave his eager student a thorough introduction to both medicine and botany, thereby waking Schumacher's natural gift for science. By 1773, at the age of 16, his keen efforts got him appointed as a military surgeon with his father's battalion in the army stationed in Rendsburg, working under Dr. Mehl's command.\n\nIn 1777 he got an 8-month leave from the army enroll as a student at Theatrum Anatomico-chirurgicum in Copenhagen (now a part of the faculty of medicine at the University of Copenhagen). While in Copenhagen he lived on nothing but an advance on his rather low wage and in 1778 he returned starved to his post in Rendsburg. He had however made a good enough impression on professor Christen Friis Rottbøll for him to call Schumacher back to Copenhagen to finish the education and to a position as prosector at the University of Copenhagen.\n\nThis was his opportunity to begin a scientific career. He graduated from Theatrum Anatomico-chirurgicum no later than 1779, and begun studying botany under the guidance of both Rottbøll and Martin Vahl, who had recently become lecturer at the University of Copenhagen Botanical Garden.\n\nIntending to follow Vahl's example Schumacher embarked upon what was intended to be an international research tour in 1784, but the timetable of the ship was changed at the last minute and he got no further than the Baltic Sea. This forced him to change his plans altogether and returning to Copenhagen he became a surgeon at both Theatrum Anatomico-chirurgicum and at Frederiks Hospital. In 1786 he took the exam of the recently started surgical academy and a position as lecturer at the academy.\n\nLater that year he received a scholarship and finally embarked on a study trip around Europe from 1786 to 1789. In Paris he studied chemistry in the lectures of Antoine Lavoisier and Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy and botany with Antoine Laurent de Jussieu. And in London he was influenced by John Hunter among others. It had been a condition of the scholarship that he would study chemistry.\n\nA marine gastropod genus:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2178254", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2178254", "title": "Ayyavazhi theology", "text": "Ayyavazhi theology\n\nAyyavazhi theology is the theology of a South Indian religious Faith and officially a sect of Hinduism known as \"Ayyavazhi\". Several fundamental theological beliefs distinguish the Ayyavazhi tradition from Hinduism.\n\nAyyavazhi believes in one God (Bhagavan Vishnu), but recognizes that the one God Vishnu can appear to humans in a multiplicity of names and forms (avataras). The first half of Akilam asserts the existence and power-status of different god-heads and in the second half after the incarnation of Vaikundar though they have a secondary place, they do exist. Especially, though all powers were surrendered to Vaikundar, Narayana acts a double role throughout the incarnation of Vaikundar, as the Father of Vaikundar. So Akilam accepts that all god-heads exist. But Vaikundar is the only powerful and supreme, which channels Ayyavazhi theology towards Henotheism.\n\nBut God is, in the highest sense, one: formless (no material form, only spiritual/transcendental), infinite, and eternal. God is changeless and is the source of consciousness (jiva-atmas) as well as the supreme consciousness (Paramatma) itself. God is beyond time, space, and causation yet still exists within everything and every being. Being formless, God is genderless (Vishnu is male, but can accept female form of Mohini). The name Ekam is mentioned quite often in Ayyavazhi scriptures. But beyond the mere mention of the 'term' several times, no longer description is provided for the word (Ekam is similar to Ek-Omkar (One AUM) of Sikhism). The term Ekam in Tamil gives simply the meaning, \"\"one and the incomparable supreme\"\". This is some sort of monistic definition about god from Ayyavazhi theology.\n\nThere are a series of lesser god-heads mentioned in Akilam with minor powers. Vaikundar is viewed on one hand as the incarnation of Ekam and on the other hand as being equal in powers to him. But during the encounter of Vaikundar with the King of Travancore, a verse of Akilam states that Ekam itself was created by Vaikundar. So Vaikundar would be superior to all.\n\nRegarding Vaikundar, Ekam remains one among the three in the Trinity in Vaikundar during the incarnation. So all qualities of Ekam (changeless attributes etc...) fits also to Vaikundar. Strengthening this view a series of quotes from Arul Nool portraits Vaikundar as eternal and reveals his Universal form.\n\nThe mythical narrative speaks of Sivam (matter) and Shakti (energy) as the next evolved powers from the supreme Ekam. Then the Three lesser God-heads (i.e., Trimurthi) which are Sivan, Vethan and Thirumal evolved from this Shakthi. It also speaks of several further evolved lesser Gods. But in Kali Yukam, due to the cruel nature of the boons offered to Kaliyan, Thirumal (the then supreme power) cannot destroy the sixth fragment of Kroni directly so all God-heads were unified into the Ekam, and Ekam Incarnated in the world as a Turine god (Ekam, Narayana and Human) in the form of Vaikundar to overcome the boons and to destroy Kali. Since all were unified in Vaikundar, in Kali Yukam Vaikundar he was the Supreme Power and he was the only worshippable God. So in this regard Ayyavazhi is also viewed as a monotheistic religion.\n\nAkilattirattu Ammanai also speaks of Dharma Yukam in which Vaikundar rules like a king. There Vaikundar will be the undisputed power ruling the fourteen worlds. No such a (i.e.) a single God to rule the fourteen worlds exists. Also no such throne to rule the fourteen worlds exists. But immediately after the incarnation of Vaikundar, Narayana told Vaikundar in the Muttappathi Vinchai that the incomparable throne is growing for him. The mythical narration of Ayyavazhi shows Vaikundar as a supreme power.\n\nThe Kroni, the primordial manifestation of evil, was fragmented into six. Each was destroyed in successive Yugas; finally, Kaliyan (the last) will be sentenced to hell after the final judgement which led to the consideration of Ayyavazhi towards dualism. Kaliyan is called an evil spirit which came to the world. So it was commonly accepted that the destruction of the maya (evil spirit) was symbolised in such a way. But the scripture is most commonly concerned with Ultimate Oneness right from the beginning to the end. So the dualistic views were contrasted by the monistic narration. Also the contents of Arul Nool, based on the teachings of Vaikundar, which were believed to be written by arulalarkal and Citars, is completely monistic.\n\nThough Ayyavazhi is mostly connected with the concept of Ekam, some followers advocate Ayyavazhi as Pantheistic, sticking to the concept of Ekan (one who appears as oneness or Ekam in Tamil) which was used to refer as God in Akilam seven. In this expression, the Akilam lays the groundwork for viewing Ayyavazhi as a pantheistic faith. In a quote in Kappu, the very first part of Akilam one, the author of Akilam says, \"By keeping us inside yourself, please help us\".Akilam1:12.\n\nRegarding Panentheism, there are many quotes in Akilam to suggest it, but there are more that reveal Ayyavazhi as monistic. For example, during the Vinchai, inside the sea, Narayana, seeing Vaikundar, says that \"You are Sivan, you are Thirumal, you are Nathan, you are the Tapas, and you are the one who is omnipresent in all which exists\". And when Vaikundar is jailed in Thiruvananthapuram he alleviates the Santror by saying \"I am the one who created the Ekam and the one who is omnipresent.\" -- (Akilam 13:395).\n\nLord Narayana has the most important role in Ayyavazhi theology compared to any other God-heads from Hindu tradition. The internal evidence states that the primary scripture of Ayyavazhi, Akilattirattu Ammanai was told by Narayan to his consort Lakshmi, which was heard by Hari Gopalan Citar.\n\nThe importance of Narayana in the theology of Ayyavazhi varies through the ages. Before the creation, though the three god-heads, Siva, Brahma and Vishnu are all treated with equal status Siva is the supreme or over-all power. All the powers came from Siva and the final words for all sort of functioning - creation, maintaining and Destroying all will be from Siva and that will be done by others. This view on Siva is similar to Saivism.\n\nAfter six yugas, during the creation of Kaliyan in the seventh Kali Yuga, Siva hearing the words of Devas without discussing with Vishnu, created Kaliyan though they have a deed that, all asuras should be created after discussing with each of the Trimurti. Due to this action of Siva, Vishnu refused to incarnate in the world for destroying the final fragment of Kroni. So Siva, Brahma and all other devas surrendered all their powers to Narayana. So from here onwards all others were puppet-reign and Narayana is the supreme universal power. This view is similar to that of Vaisnavism on Vishnu.\n\nSeveral episodes, as narrated in the Akilam (the holy text of Ayyavazhi), describe Ayya Vaikundar as an Avatar of Vishnu (a Tamil name for Vishnu).\n\nAll these episodes — starting with his 'birth' at sea as the 'son' of Narayana, the performance of the grand Tavam, the symbolic shamanic actions of incinerating the demons, the seizing of esoteric powers, and the unifying of the deities unto himself — highlight the important message that Ayya Vaikundar came as the avatar of Narayana. The followers of Ayyavazhi believe and worship him as a deity, the incarnation of Narayana. \"(see: Ayyavazhi Trinity)\"\n\nAfter the birth in the sea, Vaikundar was addressed by Akilam quite commonly as Narayana. In most of the teachings of Vaikundar to the people, he portraits himself as incarnation of Narayana. The theological definition from Akilam about Vaikundar too focuses mostly on the same point. The incarnation of Vaikundar in the world is to destroy Kali and it was the duty of Narayana to do this. So in that sense the view is strengthened that Vaikundar is Narayana himself.\n\nThen the aim of the austrity of seven virgins towards vishnu to marry them is fulfilled in the Vaikunda Avatharam by Vaikundar.\n\nRight from the beginning of the incarnation of Vaikundar in the sea, Vaikundar calls Narayana as Father, through the vinchais. The episode comes in a way that the whole details, powers, instructions, and laws were given to Vaikundar by Narayana. Then after Vaikundar comes out of the sea, he is called as Narayana by devas.\n\nSumming up, the Father - son relationship between Narayana and Vaikundar is highlighted during the three vinchai.\n\nIn Ayyavazhi, Ayya Vaikundar is considered the supreme deity and an incarnation of Mayon. Due to this belief, the followers of Ayyavazhi seem to have taken him to be the centre of all divinities. He was the incarnation, not only of Thirumal, but also of Sivan and Brahma as well. In order to demonstrate that he was the supreme deity of the present age, Ayya Vaikundar not only performed symbolic marriages in which all surrounding popular deities were surrendered and unified unto himself, he also did away with refractory evil spirits. \"(see:Ayyavazhi Trinity)\"\n\nRight from the beginning of the Vinchai of Tiruchendur Vaikundar has been focused as the ultimate power or incarnation of the supreme Ekam. All sort of administrations - Creating maintaining and destroying were all handled to Vaikundar through the Vinchai by Narayana, who was responsible for all these actions from the beginning of Kali Yuga. Narayan also says about all different divine powers and deities of the world and assure that, \"\"During the avatar, all such divine powers, deities and attributes will be surrendered and will be unifyied into you\"\".\n\nThe relations between the Ekam, Narayana and Vaikundar were understood as having different implications found in several verses of Ayyavazhi scriptures. Thiru Nadana Ula, the section which describes the situational changes that are going to happen in the world from the advent of Vaikundar, say the relation between these three power-heads as, the 'Ekam is taken inside Narayana and with that power Vaikundar is being given birth' which means, Ekam is regenerated as Vaikundar in Kali Yuga by Narayana concluding that Narayana is the Father of the Supreme Vaikundar.\n\nVaikundar, by his various incarnational activities reveals him as the supreme power apart from the relationship of Narayana.\n\nAfter the incarnation Vaikundar at the sea-shore of Tiruchendur provided Rules and regulations to God-heads. During this the supremacy of Vaikundar is revealed by the event of Vaikundar ordering all devas of the cosmos the do's and don'ts which are to be followed. Even here Vaikundar was stated as the incarnation of Ekam.\n\nAnother area in which Vaikundar has been high lightened as the supreme universal power is the Marriage with the deities. During this, Vaikundar unifyied into him all the deities. He unifyied into him Parvati in the form of Siva, unifyied Lakshmi in the form of Vishnu, Sarasvati in the form of Brahma, Valli and Deyvanai as Muruga etc., showing that Vaikundar is the incarnation of the supreme power, from which all these lower divine powers are generated.\n\nThen at the end during the Dharma Yuga, Vaikundar is placed in the Throne of the Fourteen worlds. Before Vaikundar, there was no single god-head who ruled the whole fourteen worlds. This episode shows the supremacy of Vaikundar.\n\n\n"}

Mason's 2003 arrest and prosecution for the 1957 murders of two El Segundo, California police officers made national headlines.\n\nBorn in Columbia, South Carolina, he was arrested and did time for burglary in that state in 1956. After his release in 1957, then aged 23, he hitchhiked his way to California, stopping in Shreveport, Louisiana where he purchased a revolver using an alias. He later stated that it was purchased for protection while hitchhiking.\n\nIn Hawthorne, California, Mason came upon four teenagers at a local lover's lane. Drawing his revolver, Mason forced the two couples to strip down to their underwear and bound and blindfolded them. He then raped one of the girls. Leaving the teens alive as they were, Mason then drove off in their 1949 Ford sedan, ran a red light, and was pulled over by Officers Richard Phillips and Milton Curtis of the El Segundo Police Department.\n\nMason later recalled, \"I thought, 'If I don't get them, they're gonna get me.' So when the officer turned away from me, I shot both officers, got back in the car and drove away.\" Backup units and medical personnel arrived on scene to find Curtis dead in his patrol car, with Phillips lying mortally wounded on the ground. Both had been shot three times. Meanwhile, Mason, who had been wounded by a bullet from Officer Phillips, dumped the car and fled through numerous backyards before hitchhiking his way to safety.\n\nThe murders of Officers Phillips and Curtis touched off a homicide investigation that continued for almost half a century. In 1960, the murder weapon was recovered a mile from the crime in a back yard. The serial number was traced to a purchase at Sears in Shreveport, Louisiana, under the alias George D. Wilson. The signature was matched to \"Wilson's\" signature on a YMCA receipt, located near the Sears store. El Segundo detectives proceeded to track down every George D. Wilson in the United States. However all were ruled out, and the investigation went cold.\n\nFor the next 45 years, Mason was a law-abiding citizen, never getting so much as a parking ticket. He owned two service stations, had married and raised a family. He was later described by friends and neighbors as friendly and helpful.\n\nIn 2002, with advances in computerized finger-printing technology, the FBI decided to expand the system to include prints collected during arrests in all 50 states. A match based on the partial left thumb prints lifted from the steering wheel of the stolen car, came back about a man convicted of burglary in 1956 in Columbia. He had served time for that case. Besides the matching fingerprint the evidence was also based on matching handwriting, thus linking him to the murder weapon.\n\nPolice located Mason, who had returned to and was still living in his hometown of Columbia, South Carolina. He was a wealthy retiree and a grandfather, quietly living with his family in a suburban neighborhood. Then in January 2003, a large group of police officers called at his door. Mason was completely shocked and had asked where they were from. The police officers had said, \"We are from the El Segundo Police Department, and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.\" Mason then said, \"You're homicide detectives? I think I need a lawyer.\" The police officers then told him that they were there because of the murders of two police officers in 1957. Horrified, Mason responded, \"My god, you're here for that reason?\"\n\nFollowing his arrest, Mason was further identified by the bullet graze wound scar on his back, from a bullet fired by Officer Phillips in 1957.\n\nConfronted with so much evidence, Mason admitted to detectives that he stumbled upon the teenagers while intoxicated. Afterwards, he shot both police officers in an attempt to cover up the rape, robbery, and theft of the car. Mason further told detectives, \"I really don't have an explanation for why this happened. I wish I did.\" When asked why he had raped a 15-year-old girl, Mason responded that he no longer remembered.\n\nMason pleaded guilty to the murders and was sentenced to two consecutive life terms, with a minimum of 7 years. As part of the deal, the rape, robbery and grand theft charges were dropped. At his sentencing hearing, Mason tearfully apologized to the families of Officers Phillips and Curtis. He said, \"It's impossible to express to so many people how sorry I am. I do not understand why I did this. It does not fit in my life. It is not the person I know. I detest these crimes.\"\n\nOne El Segundo detective commented, \"He was remorseful. But I think he was more sad and more sorry for having been caught.\"\n\nMason, 75, was turned down for parole in 2009. The three-member board decided Mason should not come before the panel again for the maximum period of 15 years until March 2024 when he would have been 90 years old. California prosecutors were determined that he would never be released.\n\nHe was incarcerated in South Carolina, as his plea bargain granted him approval to serve his prison sentence near his family.\n\nThe widow of Officer Curtis commented, \"I'm not his victim any more. My son is not his victim any more. I'm so grateful, and I had to wait this long. It's worth the wait.\"\n\nIn a 2003 interview with People Magazine, Jerri Mason Whittaker, Gerald Mason's daughter, said, \"There really aren't words to describe the range of emotions we've gone through.\" Even so, she insisted, \"I could not have had a better father.\"\n\nThis story was shown on episodes of \"Cold Case Files,\" \"Forensic Files\", \"48 Hours Mystery\" and \"Murder Book\".\n\nMason passed away in prison on January 22, 2017, 9 days before his 83rd birthday. He spent 14 years in prison. His next parole hearing was still 7 years away.\n\n"}

Males are superbly coloured with a fiery orange nape, green ears, and a purple crown. The breast is grey, and divided from the abdomen by a wide, dark blue band. Their wings are olive green covered with dark spots, and the tail is tipped with white. Females are mostly green, with a white abdomen, blue wing tips, light blue breast, and a small, dark blue spot on the back of the head. Both sexes have yellow eyes and eye-rings. Despite its colourful plumage, the superb fruit dove is well-camouflaged amongst the rainforest foliage.\n\nNative to Australasia, the superb fruit dove lives in the rainforests of New Guinea, Australia, Solomon Islands, the Philippines and Sulawesi of Indonesia. In Australia, it is found from southern New South Wales around the town of Moruya and extends further north, where it becomes more common to Cape York in Queensland. In some areas of its range, such as the New Guinean rainforest, it is a resident bird; in more marginal or seasonal habitats such as those in Australia, flocks are known to move about according to the availability of food (Frith \"et al.\" 1976).\n\nThe superb fruit dove feeds primarily upon fruits and berries. In the Port Moresby area, the bulk of its diet was found to consist of figs, notably \"Ficus albipila\" and \"Ficus benjamina\", \"Canarium australianum\" drupes, and \"Archontophoenix\", \"Calamus\" and \"Livistona\" palm fruit. Also frequently eaten were the fruits of various cinnamon trees, \"Litsea\", \"Neolitsea\" and \"Cryptocarya\". Less important food were fruits of Ylang-ylang (\"Cananga odorata\"), \"Syzygium\", and \"Vitex cofassus\". They eat smaller fruit than some other fruit doves; the maximum recorded volume was 2.5 cm³; in a spherical fruit, a 1.7 cm diameter.\n\nSuperb fruit doves' wings whistle when they fly, and their call is a steady \"coo-coo-coo-coo\".\n\nThe breeding season lasts from September to January. A small platform of twigs is built 5–30 metres off the ground, in which the female lays one small, white egg. She incubates it during the night. The male takes his turn during the day.\n\nHabitat loss is a primary threat, but the superb fruit dove is still fairly widespread and common throughout its large range. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species ranks it as least concern. In New South Wales, however, the superb fruit dove is considered vulnerable, meaning it is likely to become endangered.\n\n"}

Through PBS' Program Differentiation Plan, the network's programming was eventually divided between it and three other PBS members in the Indianapolis market – WFYI (channel 20), Muncie-based WIPB (channel 49) and by 1992, WTBU (channel 69, now Daystar owned-and-operated station WDTI).\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nIn 2009, WTIU upgraded the station's primary digital channel to allow the transmission of programming in high definition, originally maintaining a schedule separate from that of WTIU's main channel. The station also launched a secondary service on digital subchannel 30.2, branded as \"TIU-2,\" which primarily aired educational programming and college telecourses; the subchannel was converted into \"TIU World,\" serving as an affiliate of PBS World in 2010. At the same time, WTIU added two additional subchannels, respectively carrying programming from the lifestyle and how-to service Create (branded as \"TIU Create\"), safety and emergency network Echo (branded as \"TIU Echo\") and the respectively carrying programming from the children's service PBS Kids (branded as \"TIU Kids\").\n\nWTIU began operating its digital signal in 2007, broadcasting on UHF channel 14. WTIU shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 30, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 14. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 30.\n\nWTIU's flagship original production is the public and cultural affairs program \"The Weekly Special\", in production since 2005. \"The Friday Zone\", in production since 1999, is an award-winning children's program syndicated on seven PBS stations across Indiana. WTIU also regularly produces documentaries, typically focusing on local or regional topics. Documentary series produced by the station have included \"Our Town\" (which focus on a single community's culture and history) and \"The Spirit of Monroe County\" (which focuses on the people and places of interest in Monroe County). WTIU also produces news updates in the form of twice-daily five-minute \"NewsBreak\" segments as well as the half-hour weekly newsmagazine \"Indiana Newsdesk\". In 1973, WTIU collaborated with the IU Opera Theater to produce a telecast of the opera \"Myshkin\", which earned the station a Peabody Award.\n\n"}

{"id": "2178278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2178278", "title": "Jet (particle physics)", "text": "Jet (particle physics)\n\nA jet is a narrow cone of hadrons and other particles produced by the hadronization of a quark or gluon in a particle physics or heavy ion experiment. Particles carrying a color charge, such as quarks, cannot exist in free form because of QCD confinement which only allows for colorless states. When an object containing color charge fragments, each fragment carries away some of the color charge. In order to obey confinement, these fragments create other colored objects around them to form colorless objects. The ensemble of these objects is called a jet, since the fragments all tend to travel in the same direction, forming a narrow \"jet\" of particles. Jets are measured in particle detectors and studied in order to determine the properties of the original quarks.\n\nIn relativistic heavy ion physics, jets are important because the originating hard scattering is a natural probe for the QCD matter created in the collision, and indicate its phase. When the QCD matter undergoes a phase crossover into quark gluon plasma, the energy loss in the medium grows significantly, effectively quenching (reducing the intensity of) the outgoing jet.\n\nExample of jet analysis techniques are:\n\n\nThe Lund string model is an example of a jet fragmentation model.\n\nJets are produced in QCD hard scattering processes, creating high transverse momentum quarks or gluons, or collectively called partons in the partonic picture.\n\nThe probability of creating a certain set of jets is described by the jet production cross section, which is an average of elementary perturbative QCD quark, antiquark, and gluon processes, weighted by the parton distribution functions. For the most frequent jet pair production process, the two particle scattering, the jet production cross section in a hadronic collision is given by\n\nformula_1\n\nwith\n\n\nElementary cross sections formula_4 are e.g. calculated to the leading order of perturbation theory in Peskin & Schroeder (1995), section 17.4. A review of various parameterizations of parton distribution functions and the calculation in the context of Monte Carlo event generators is discussed in T. Sjöstrand \"et al.\" (2003), section 7.4.1.\n\nPerturbative QCD calculations may have colored partons in the final state, but only the colorless hadrons that are ultimately produced are observed experimentally. Thus, to describe what is observed in a detector as a result of a given process, all outgoing colored partons must first undergo parton showering and then combination of the produced partons into hadrons. The terms \"fragmentation\" and \"hadronization\" are often used interchangeably in the literature to describe soft QCD radiation, formation of hadrons, or both processes together. \n\nAs the parton which was produced in a hard scatter exits the interaction, the strong coupling constant will increase with its separation. This increases the probability for QCD radiation, which is predominantly shallow-angled with respect to the originating parton. Thus, one parton will radiate gluons, which will in turn radiate pairs and so on, with each new parton nearly collinear with its parent. This can be described by convolving the spinors with fragmentation functions formula_5, in a similar manner to the evolution of parton density functions. This is described by a Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) type equation\n\nformula_6\n\nParton showering produces partons of successively lower energy, and must therefore exit the region of validity for perturbative QCD. Phenomenological models must then be applied to describe the length of time when showering occurs, and then the combination of colored partons into bound states of colorless hadrons, which is inherently not-perturbative. One example is the Lund String Model, which is implemented in many modern event generators.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2178283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2178283", "title": "2005 Ashes series", "text": "2005 Ashes series\n\nThe 2005 Ashes series was that year's edition of the long-standing cricket rivalry between England and Australia. Starting on 21 July 2005, England and Australia played five Tests, with the Ashes held by Australia as the most recent victors. The final result was a 2–1 series win for England, who succeeded (for the first time since 1986–87) in their biennial attempt to win the urn.\n\nIn March, Australia captain Ricky Ponting said this Ashes series would be the closest since Australia's dominance began in 1989. Since 1989, when Australia started their winning Ashes streak, England had lost by more than one match in all but one of the series played, that of 1997. During that period, Australia were the pre-eminent side in the world, while England had dropped from being the top-rated in 1981 to sixth for much of the 1990s. They reached a low point in 1999 with a series loss to New Zealand leaving them bottom of the unofficial \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" rankings. However, since the previous series in 2002–03, England had improved on their fifth place in the official rankings, and were second before this series. Australia were still top-ranked, but England had won 14 and drawn three of their 18 previous Test matches since March 2004, and had won six successive series. Nonetheless, before the First Test some Australians, including fast bowler Glenn McGrath, were suggesting that a 5–0 win in the series for Australia was a serious possibility.\n\nThe BBC reported on the day after the series that it was \"hailed as the most thrilling series ever\". Individual matches were very closely fought, with one match decided by a two-run margin, one match drawn with only one wicket remaining, and one match won by three wickets. The outcome of the contest was not decided until the very last day of the series.\n\nAustralia won the first Test comfortably, but the second Test saw England level the series with a two-run victory, the narrowest win in Ashes history. The third Test ended in a draw (with England one wicket away from a win), and England won the fourth Test in Nottingham (Trent Bridge) by three wickets, losing seven men in a chase of 129, after England enforced the follow on after gaining a lead of 259 on first innings.\n\nThe fifth and final Test started on 8 September, at the Oval in London. It entered its final day with England batting in their second innings, 40 runs ahead with nine wickets in hand. Australia needed a win to force a 2–2 series draw and retain the Ashes; any other result would give the Ashes to England and end 16 years and eight series of Australian dominance. After a day of fluctuating fortunes, England established a lead of 341 after Kevin Pietersen's maiden century, and Australia batted for one over before the teams went off for bad light, the stumps were pulled out of the ground, and the match was declared a draw, ensuring the return of the Ashes to England.\na) Collingwood was added on 1 August for the second Test, but sent back to his county on 3 August.\n\nb) An injury to Simon Jones saw Anderson come into the squad for the fifth Test, while Tremlett was dropped because he was \"not on top of his game\" according to England's chairman of selectors David Graveney. Collingwood was also called up again.\n\nc) Clark was called up as cover for pace bowlers McGrath and Lee before the third Test.\n\nThe first day of cricket at Lord's saw 17 of the total of 40 wickets fall, and though Australia lost 10 of them, the BBC saw it as \"advantage Australia\". Ricky Ponting won the toss and chose to bat, and Steve Harmison shook up the opening batsmen early on, hitting Australia's batsmen with bouncers; the second ball of the match hit Justin Langer on the elbow but he went on to make 40 and top score for Australia. The pitch offered bounce and swing from the start, while Matthew Hoggard got a ball on line to swing between Matthew Hayden's bat and pad and into his off stump. Hayden was gone for 12, having, according to the BBC report, \"played nervously from the word go\". Australia still scored at a rate above 4.5 runs per over in the mini-session before drinks, which was taken when Harmison cut Ponting on the right cheek, and in his next over Harmison got his first wicket of the series as Ponting edged him to Andrew Strauss at third slip for 9. Langer was next to depart, having scored at above five an over when he top-edged a pull shot to Harmison at square-leg for 40 off the bowling of Andrew Flintoff, whose first over in Ashes cricket was a wicket maiden. In the next over, Simon Jones was brought on, he got an immediate reward, with Damien Martyn caught behind for 2, and in the penultimate over before lunch Michael Clarke was lbw to Jones, leaving Australia five down after the first session of play.\n\nAdam Gilchrist, Simon Katich and Shane Warne all played a part in getting Australia past 100, forging innings in the 20s, but Flintoff had Gilchrist for 26 before Warne and Katich added 49 for the seventh wicket. Harmison, coming back for a second spell, was wicketless in his first two overs but after drinks he took four wickets for seven runs in 2.2 overs as Australia were all out for 190. He finished with five for 43. Glenn McGrath was the not out batsman, ending with 10 runs, and he also opened the bowling with Brett Lee. England batted for six overs until tea without losing a wicket, scoring 10 runs, but McGrath, who bowled his usual accurate line and length, reaped the rewards after tea. Marcus Trescothick fell first ball after tea, edging to slip to become McGrath's 500th victim in Test cricket, and Strauss fell in similar fashion three balls later. Michael Vaughan and Ian Bell survived six overs, adding seven runs before McGrath had them bowled in the 13th and 15th over respectively. With Flintoff bowled by McGrath in the 17th, and England had lost five wickets for 21 runs, with five of their top six batsmen out in single figures. However, Kevin Pietersen and Geraint Jones batted together to make England's highest partnership of the innings, adding 58 and, according to the BBC report, \"treating Jason Gillespie with some disdain\". A short ball from Lee was too much for Geraint Jones, though, and he fended it to wicket-keeper Gilchrist, out for 30. Ashley Giles hit two quick boundaries to bat out the over, but the last ball of Lee's next over was glanced to the keeper, and Giles was out for 11, and England were 92 for 7 overnight – needing 98 for the last three wickets to get level with Australia.\n\nEngland cut the deficit on the second morning, but were still bowled out before they could build a first-innings lead. Hoggard departed for a 16-ball duck, cutting a delivery from Warne to Hayden in the slips. Pietersen now started to attack, taking 21 runs off seven deliveries before he was out caught by Martyn, a diving catch just inside the boundary, and England were nine down for 122, still trailing by 68. The English 10th wicket pairing of Simon Jones and Harmison added 33 after that, a stand that was the fifth-highest of the game thus far and which reduced Australia's lead to 35 runs. In the field, England started by having Langer run out for 6 in the fifth over, but Hayden and Ponting rebuilt to bat until lunch unbeaten.\n\nThough Hayden was bowled by Flintoff for 34 three overs after lunch, the batsmen from three to six all passed 40; it was to be the only time in the series that Australia accomplished this feat. Clarke needed an extra life to do it, but made England pay after Pietersen dropped him on 21, and thus the partnership was allowed to last for 34.3 overs, with 155 runs being scored. Flintoff was smashed to all corners, with 84 runs being scored off him in his 19 second-day overs, but in the last 10 overs England came back to take wickets. Started by an inside-edge from Clarke off Hoggard, which left Australia's 24-year-old batsman bowled for 91, and Australia lost a further three wickets for 24 runs before the end of the day. The Australian lead was still 314, twice England's first innings total and then some, and Katich was still batting, not out on 10.\n\nFour overs into the morning, specialist spin bowler Giles was involved in a dismissal for the only time in the match, having Lee run out for 8. However, Gillespie batted for an hour and 15 minutes, and took part in a 52-run stand with the recognised batsman, Katich before Simon Jones got his reward with an away-swinger that crashed into Gillespie's off stump, after having three catches dropped. The last-wicket partnership rubbed it in with 43 more runs before Katich was caught by Simon Jones off Harmison, but England were set what would be a world record 420 to win.\n\nThey started positively, riding some favourable umpiring decisions; Aleem Dar turned down four strong leg before wicket (LBW) appeals off Warne. Strauss and Trescothick could thus add 80 for the first wicket before Strauss edged a short ball from Lee back into the bowler's waiting hands. Vaughan got off the mark with a four with his second ball, before facing 24 dot balls in the next three-quarters of an hour. Meanwhile, wickets fell at the other end, as Trescothick departed for 44, edging a straight ball from Warne to first slip after having taken him for 10 in the previous over, and Bell was out LBW to a ball that did not turn. Three overs later, Vaughan was bowled cleanly by Lee and Flintoff gave a catch to Gilchrist, England were five down for 119, and though Pietersen once again put on more than 40 runs with Geraint Jones, England still needed 301 for the last five wickets, which would mean five partnerships higher than England had managed all match.\n\nRain frustrated both Australia and neutral fans who wanted to see cricket played on the morning of the fourth day, but at 1545 BST the rain relented and the covers were taken off. Then, it took 10 overs for Australia to wrap up England's innings, McGrath taking four of the five wickets required and Warne the last; Giles, Hoggard, Harmison and Simon Jones were all dismissed for ducks, and England could only cut 24 runs off Australia's eventual win margin of 239. Twenty-two of those fourth-day runs came from Pietersen who was left stranded on an unbeaten 64 to have a Test batting average of 121 after his first match.\n\nThe psychological battles before the match included many Australian statements to the press about how the pitch \"played into [their] hands\", that England had been \"spending too much time talking\", and that their top order had been \"taking bad options\". England kept quieter, until just before the game stories appeared about how the Edgbaston game would be decided at the toss: whichever side won it would choose to bowl first and would win, as had happened in 12 of the 13 Tests at Edgbaston since 1991. England came out on top in the mind game after Ricky Ponting won the toss and put England in to bat; Jonathan Agnew of the BBC claimed \"it was clear that his decision had backfired\" once England started batting.\n\nEngland took advantage of being inserted and came back strongly, becoming the first team to hit 400 runs in a first day of Test cricket against Australia since 1938. The English scored at a pace above four an over in their opening partnership, helped by the freak injury that Glenn McGrath sustained before the match; during a warm-up (playing rugby), the paceman accidentally stood on a stray cricket ball, tearing ankle ligaments. Australia had to field Michael Kasprowicz as replacement, and missed McGrath's superior control and wicket-taking abilities in the match.\n\nThe English innings began with Marcus Trescothick hitting nine boundaries off Brett Lee, while Andrew Strauss preferred Jason Gillespie and Kasprowicz. Their 112-run partnership was the highest by England in the series thus far; the Australians had only surpassed that once, through Damien Martyn and Michael Clarke's 155 at Lord's. To add to Australia's woes, Trescothick was caught off a no-ball on 32, and eventually went on to make 90, being the second man out shortly after lunch, with the score 164 for 2 after 32.3 overs.\n\nIn the next five overs, England lost both Ian Bell, who notched up his third successive single-figure score, and Michael Vaughan, who pulled a short Gillespie delivery to the hands of Lee, but that did little to slow the scoring rate. 132 runs had been taken in the morning session; the afternoon yielded 157. Kevin Pietersen, in his second Test match, hit ten fours and one six, and made a 103-run partnership in 105 balls with Andrew Flintoff. Flintoff's 68 was scored off 62 balls, and Lee's 18 balls were taken for 26 runs, including two sixes.\n\nLee bowled 17 overs, and conceded 111 runs, but got the one wicket of Pietersen, who pulled to Simon Katich for 71 off 76 balls, and with the score on 342 for 7 with 24 scheduled overs remaining in the day. Then, Steve Harmison smacked two fours and a six in a 15-minute 17, and Simon Jones stuck around with Matthew Hoggard for a last-wicket partnership of 32, Jones making 19 not out. Shane Warne finally got the better of Hoggard, to end with four for 116, but by that time England had gone past 400 and ended up with a total of 407 in just under 80 overs. Just as Australia's opening batsman walked out and prepared for their innings, the rain began to fall on Edgbaston, and play had to be stopped.\n\nEngland's total could have been significantly higher with a bit more top-order application, especially given the high scoring rate. However, England's bowlers started well when Harmison bowled a maiden over first up to Justin Langer, and Matthew Hayden drove Harmison's new-ball partner Hoggard to short mid-off for a golden duck – the first of Hayden's Test career. Then, Ponting and Langer hit runs just as quickly as England had done, before the umpire's finger went up twice more before lunch; Ponting swept a shot off Ashley Giles to the opposing captain Vaughan for 61, and Martyn was run out taking a single for 20, again by Vaughan. Langer and Clarke continued after lunch in the same vein, hitting 76 runs in an hour and a half, but a couple of wickets within five overs took Australia to 208 for 5, needing 199 for the last five wickets for parity. The partnership between Langer and Adam Gilchrist saw them to tea with no further loss, as Langer continued his four-hour unbeaten knock and went into the tea break on 72.\n\nThe pair looked to close England's lead and batted unbeaten after tea for eight overs, but again the England bowlers intervened, this time in the shape of Simon Jones, who got plenty of reverse swing both ways and used that to trap Langer with a yorker – gone for 82, which was to be Australia's highest score in the innings. Australia's last four, which now included Kasprowicz, who had a batting average 10 runs higher than McGrath, were nevertheless all dismissed for single-figure scores, Flintoff taking the last two men LBW with the last two balls, although there was some argument about whether the first dismissal, that of Gillespie, should have been given. Meanwhile, Giles' return of 3/78, including Ponting, Clarke and Warne, was to be his best bowling figures all series.\n\nHowever, England got their 99-run lead and continued to build their lead before stumps were drawn. After Trescothick and Strauss had hit five boundaries in six overs and taken the second innings total to 25 for 0, Ponting brought on Warne in the seventh over, and Warne broke through with his second ball of the innings; his leg break came into the left-hander's stumps and broke them completely, and Strauss was bowled for 6. Nightwatchman Hoggard survived four balls to end the day, when England held a lead of 124 runs, with nine wickets in hand.\n\nThe third day saw a total of 17 wickets fall, with Warne and Flintoff being the leading performers for their sides. First up, Lee grabbed three wickets in 12 minutes: Trescothick slashed a wide delivery and got an edge to the keeper, captain Vaughan got his third single-figure score in the series as he failed to cover his stumps to a straight one, and Hoggard edged to Hayden in the slips for 1.\n\nEngland had lost four wickets for six runs, and were 31 for 4 with Bell and Pietersen at the crease. Pietersen survived what looked like an edge on the first ball he faced, and went on to make 20 before he was given out in a similar situation from Warne. His 41-run partnership with Bell took England's lead past 150, and with Bell having batted past the hour mark, he needed 29 more for his half-century when he gave a tiny edge to Gilchrist.\n\nEngland's last recognised batting pairing, between Flintoff and wicket-keeper Geraint Jones, saw England to lunch, but Flintoff had suffered an injury to his left shoulder and looked in obvious pain, and Jones departed shortly after lunch. Giles lasted longer, batting through 45 minutes before he was caught by Hayden, and Harmison faced one delivery to leave England at 131 for 9.\n\nSimon Jones and Flintoff carried on, however. Jones managed 12 runs in his 42-minute stay at the crease while Flintoff took Lee for 33 off the 28 balls he faced from the Australian paceman. Flintoff also took runs off Kasprowicz, with his third over yielding 20 runs for England, including a couple of no-balls. At one point during Flintoff's innings, Ponting had nine men on the boundary, with only the bowler and wicket-keeper inside the circle. However, Flintoff hit a six over them, too, and another of his sixes landed on top of the stands. Flintoff ended with 73, as the only man to pass 25 for England, before he was bowled by Warne. Warne finished with figures of six for 46 from 23.1 overs, having bowled unchanged from the seventh over till the end.\n\nHayden and Langer started positively, taking runs off the occasional bad balls that were served up by Harmison, Hoggard and Giles, and by the 12th over, they had racked up 47 for no loss, and were well on the way to chasing the target of 282. Then, Flintoff came and bowled the over of the series. He failed to make the hat-trick he was on from the last innings, but with his second ball he bowled Langer with a leg cutter. His third delivery was narrowly turned down for lbw, the fourth found Ponting's edge but failed to carry to slip, an lbw appeal on the fifth was also turned down, but his sixth which Ponting left outside the offstump was a no-ball, so there was a seventh and final delivery, another leg cutter and Ponting was out caught behind. Including the previous innings, Flintoff had taken four wickets in nine balls. But more importantly, Australia had been reduced from 47/0 to 48/2.\n\nHayden kept going, and his dismissal came in an over where Australia had taken eight runs from the first four balls; however, Simon Jones got the last laugh over Hayden, only to later be reprimanded and fined by the International Cricket Council for his celebrations. England kept on the pressure, getting three more wickets before the scheduled close of play; Giles getting two, dismissing Katich and Gilchrist, and an in-swinging ball from Flintoff took care of Gillespie, who was trapped lbw.\n\nAn extra half-hour of play was allowed, as a result was nearing, but Warne and Clarke defied the English. Warne \"took the attacking approach\", and took on Giles for 12 in one over. He ended on 20 not out overnight, as Warne and Clarke batted together for 40 minutes before Harmison, bowling his third spell of the day, brought the third day's proceedings to an end with a slower ball that was not read correctly by Clarke, who missed the ball completely to be bowled. Mark Nicholas, in live commentary, described the delivery as \"...one of the great balls. Given the moment, given the batsman and given the match, that is a staggering gamble that has paid off for Harmison. He bowled it perfectly.\" England now needed two wickets on the fourth day, while Australia needed 107 runs for the victory.\n\nEngland were said to be \"on the brink of...victory\", but Australia came back thanks to two partnerships worth more than 40 to take themselves within three runs of a 2–0 series lead. First, Warne and Lee added 45 for the ninth wicket, before Warne trod on his own stumps after a full Flintoff ball and was out hit wicket. Kasprowicz came in and supported Lee well, fending off aggressive bowling from Flintoff and Harmison, and Simon Jones dropped Kasprowicz with 15 left to get. With Australia edging towards victory, preferring singles to risky boundaries, England were now bowling aggressive short balls at the tail-enders, hoping for short catches or to surprise the batsmen with a yorker. With four runs needed to win, Lee drove Harmison's attempted yorker towards the boundary where it was fielded. The Australians crossed for a single, leaving three runs to win with the weaker batsman Kasprowicz on strike. Harmison delivered another short ball, which Kasprowicz fended and Geraint Jones took an athletic catch down the leg side. England appealed, and Kasprowicz was given out caught by Bowden. However subsequent replays suggested that the ball contacted Kasprowicz's glove while not in contact with the bat handle, rendering Bowden's decision technically incorrect. England were nonetheless declared victors – if in almost the most narrow way possible – and the series was thus level with three matches left.\n\nAfter a short engagement with his team in victory celebrations, the subsequent reaction of Flintoff to the winning dismissal was to console the despondent batsman, Lee – a gesture which was widely commented upon as indicative of the good sportsmanship and mutual respect between the teams which characterised the series.\n\nEngland's two-run victory was the narrowest result in Ashes cricket history thus far (there had been two Ashes Tests won by a margin of only three runs). It is also the second narrowest margin of victory in Test cricket history behind only the West Indies’ victory by a single run over Australia in Adelaide in 1994.\n\nDay 1\n\nWith the series square after England's close win in the second match at Edgbaston in Birmingham, neither side could secure the series win after the third Test at Old Trafford in Manchester, so there was still all to play for. The match began with England winning the toss, and choosing to bat first, thus giving Shane Warne a chance to become the first man to take 600 Test wickets in England's first innings, and he did so by getting Marcus Trescothick out caught behind by Australian wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist when he mistimed a sweep shot, earning Warne a standing ovation from the Old Trafford faithful.\n\nAfter naming an unchanged line-up, England were immediately faced by the pairing of Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee. There were doubts about whether they could play before the match started, because of the injuries they had sustained earlier, but they both passed fitness tests. Though Andrew Strauss succumbed in the tenth over, England lost no further wickets before lunch, and only one more before tea. There were many missed opportunities for Australia, who dropped Trescothick, Michael Vaughan (twice) and Ian Bell on the first day, which helped Trescothick and Vaughan to get a partnership of 137 before Trescothick was dismissed after lunch. Vaughan powered on, making his hundred after 206 minutes to become the first man in the series to get a century.\n\nHaving made 166 runs, an innings described as \"majestic\", Vaughan eventually hit Simon Katich straight to McGrath at the boundary, but had still made what was to be the highest individual score in the series. Together with Vaughan, Australia were also faced with a more defiant Bell, who had not passed 25 in his four first innings in the series, but made 59 before the day ended. Picking up where Vaughan left off, Bell, Kevin Pietersen and nightwatchman Matthew Hoggard closed out the day for England with the scoreboard reading 341 for 5, with Lee adding two wickets to the tally before the end of the day.\n\nDay 2\n\nBell did not add to his overnight score, being given out caught behind in controversial circumstances, as replays indicated any contact with the ball involved neither bat nor glove. Following a brief rain interval England then lost two more wickets just before lunch, Andrew Flintoff after scoring a quick-fire 46 and Geraint Jones for 42. After lunch Australia quickly dispatched the remaining two wickets for just a further 10 runs, bowling England out for a score of 444, with McGrath finishing on his worst-ever Test figures of nought for 86.\n\nAustralia started their innings tentatively with Hoggard dropping a low catch Matthew Hayden off his own bowling. Just before tea Australia lost their first wicket with Hayden out caught at short leg from Ashley Giles first over. After tea Australia lost another couple of wickets, Ricky Ponting caught for seven and Hayden given out lbw for 34. Gilchrist put on 30 before edging the first ball of Simon Jones' spell to Geraint Jones.\n\nThis brought in Michael Clarke who had been recuperating at the team hotel after damaging his back on the first day. Owing to this injury, Clarke needed Hayden to act as a runner. Warne made inroads with the bat, just as at Edgbaston four days previously, but Clarke only managed to add seven runs before being deceived by a reverse swinging delivery from Simon Jones. Warne and Jason Gillespie saw the day out with Warne finishing on 45 not out.\n\nThe day finished with Australia on 214 for 7, 230 behind and needing another 31 runs to avoid a follow-on. The score was adjusted from 210 overnight owing to an umpire failing to signal a four byes.\n\nDay 3\n\nRain delayed the start of play until 16:00 BST, and even then only eight overs were possible before play was again suspended, although a further six overs were bowled later on before yet more rain meant that play was abandoned for the day. Australia had the better of the short day's play, adding 50 runs without loss to pass the follow-on target, although Warne was lucky to survive on two occasions thanks to errors by Geraint Jones: with Warne on 55, Jones missed a relatively straightforward stumping opportunity, and on 68 he was dropped after edging a ball from Flintoff. Australia closed on 264 for 7, still 180 in arrears, but England probably felt that they missed several opportunities to put the game beyond their opponents.\n\nDay 4\n\nHaving been hampered by a rain-shortened day three, the Australians were ready to put more wood to the ball on day four, and they did not disappoint. Warne continued his march towards his maiden Test century before holing out with a hook shot to a well-placed Giles at 90. Simon Jones mopped up the other two wickets to bowl Australia out for 302, Jones finishing the innings with a career best figures of six for 53.\n\nThe English opening partnership of Strauss and Trescothick began their response, scoring 26 before lunch. After lunch, Trescothick played on to be bowled after scoring 41 giving McGrath his first wicket of the match. Strauss put together a fine century, his sixth from just 17 matches, scoring 106 before getting out caught. Gilchrist missed two stumping opportunities to remove Bell and failing to hold a catch to remove Flintoff. Bell capitalised on Gilchrist's errors, partnering Strauss for 28 overs and recording a well-deserved 65. Geraint Jones also added a swift 27 with England more concerned about scoring quickly than staying at the crease, and England declared on 280 to give them a spell at Australia in the evening and a chance of winning the match the next day. McGrath recorded another five-wicket haul in an innings, but was expensive, giving away 115 runs. Warne, despite bowling 25 overs, failed to take a wicket, recording figures of 0/74.\n\nAustralia needed 423 to win, which would be a record fourth innings total to win a match. Australia saw out the last 10 overs without losing a wicket and put 24 runs, leaving 399.\n\nDay 5\n\nEnglish hopes of a win were high, and 20,000 people were locked out of the stadium in addition to the 23,000 capacity crowd. Australia started the day needing 399 more runs from 98 overs if they were to claim an unlikely victory. The day started poorly for them with Justin Langer falling for 14 on the seventh ball of the day, nicking a ball delivered by Hoggard behind to Geraint Jones. Ponting narrowly survived being run out early on and this proved crucial in the context of the match as the momentum gradually swung in Australia's direction. At one point Australia racked up runs at such a rate that a win became a real possibility. Despite losing Clarke and Gillespie in quick succession to send the team to 264 for 7, Ponting battled on before eventually succumbing to Steve Harmison after seven hours at the crease to record the first Australian century of the series with a score of 156. This was good enough to earn Man of the Match honours.\n\nAfter the dismissal of Ponting, Australia were 354 for 9 with only four overs remaining, and another thrilling climax occurred with England having a real chance of snatching victory in similar fashion to the second Test. However, the unfancied pairing of Lee and McGrath handled the remaining 24 deliveries to finish on 371 for 9, 52 short of victory but sufficient to draw the game and leave the series tied at 1–1.\n\nDay 1\n\nGlenn McGrath was once again ruled out because of injury, this time to his elbow, and Australia also dropped the out-of-form Jason Gillespie, leaving them with a seam attack of Brett Lee, debutant Shaun Tait and Michael Kasprowicz. England, having been on top in the last two Tests, were unchanged.\n\nEngland won the toss and chose to bat, and they got off to a flyer. Boosted by no-balls from the seamers – a total of 18 before lunch – Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss made hay quickly, and enjoyed batting on a pitch which gave the bowlers no aid. They recorded their second 100-run opening partnership of the series, before Strauss was freakishly dismissed for 35, sweeping Shane Warne onto his boot and into Matthew Hayden's waiting hands at slip – a wicket confirmed by the third umpire. Michael Vaughan continued on his fine form from Old Trafford, though, punishing bad balls from Lee to go into lunch with his score on 14. Trescothick, meanwhile, rode his luck, as he was bowled off a no-ball on 55, much to Lee's displeasure. At lunch England were 129 for 1.\n\nOnly 3.1 overs were possible in the afternoon session, owing to rain. Coming back after tea, England immediately lost two wickets to Tait, who used the cloud cover to good effect and swung the ball well. However, Vaughan and Kevin Pietersen batted well together for a 67-run partnership, although they were each dropped once. Towards the end of the day, Ricky Ponting brought himself on, and his medium pace yielded a wicket – that of Vaughan for 58. Overnight, the match was evenly poised with England 229 for 4.\n\nDay 2\n\nAustralia dismissed Pietersen at the beginning of the morning's play, edging a full outswinger from Lee through to wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist. But an unbeaten century partnership from Andrew Flintoff and Geraint Jones took England's score to 344 for 5 at lunch.\n\nAfter lunch, the pair continued to score quickly for another hour, and extended their partnership to 177 before Flintoff was lbw to Tait for 102, his first Test century against Australia. The loss of Flintoff did not deter the English, as Jones continued to hit runs through the off side on the way to his highest score against the Australians, making 85 before he was caught and bowled by Kasprowicz. The next two wickets fell quickly, but a stubborn last-wicket partnership of 23 between Matthew Hoggard and Simon Jones – including an incident where the ball hit the stumps but the bails failed to fall off – saw England to 477 all out at tea.\n\nIn the evening session, England's bowlers, especially Hoggard, managed to find much more swing than the Australian bowlers had done, and ripped through the Australian top order. The first three wickets fell in a crucial period of 11 balls (although the third, which dismissed Damien Martyn lbw, was a poor decision – television replays indicated that the ball hit the bat before the body). By stumps Australia had been reduced to 99 for 5 to complete an excellent day for England.\n\nDay 3\n\nKatich and Gilchrist decided that attack was the best form of defence, adding 58 in only 8.5 overs in the morning, before England came back to take the next four wickets for the addition of only 18 runs, leaving Australia perilously placed at 175 for 9. Simon Jones was the main culprit, using swing to good effect as he removed Katich and Warne in successive balls, and then had Kasprowicz clean bowled. Lee added 47 in 44 balls, including three huge sixes, to take Australia's score to 218, before he was caught off Jones' bowling to give Jones his fifth wicket of the innings. Despite their aggressive batting, Australia therefore finished the first innings 259 runs behind.\n\nVaughan then gambled, by enforcing the follow-on on the visitors (the first time Australia had followed on in 17 years and 190 Tests, as they had not been made to follow on since facing Pakistan in Karachi in 1988). By lunch, Australia had reached 14 without loss in their second innings, and they powered on in the afternoon session, only losing Hayden and adding 100 more runs before tea. For England, the afternoon session was their worst of the match – to compound their misery, Simon Jones showed signs of injury, and Strauss dropped Justin Langer on 38.\n\nIn the evening session, England managed to take three wickets, but also dropped a catch and missed a stumping. Australia thus finished the day still 37 runs in arrears but with six wickets still in hand. Simon Jones also went off the field during the evening session with an ankle injury, and was taken to hospital for an ankle scan. While Jones was off the field receiving attention, substitute fielder Gary Pratt ran out Australia captain Ponting. As he left the field, Ponting expressed his displeasure to the England dressing room at their frequent use of subs (allegedly to keep their key bowlers fresh). Although this tactic was widely felt by commentators to be against the spirit of the game, there was no legal stipulation against it. In fact, Pratt was on the field owing to a genuinely serious injury to Simon Jones, and he never played international cricket again.\n\nDay 4\nDay Four began in earnest with Michael Clarke and Katich continuing their partnership from the previous day. However, Katich had already twice flirted with dismissal, saved only by chance both times. In the words of BBC cricket commentator Henry Blofeld, \"It's very much a game of chess – white-flannelled figures on green grass.\" The English and the Australians proceeded into a cold war for a good part of the morning, with England attempting to frustrate the Australian batting, but with the latter refusing to take the bait. England's lead slowly evaporated without a wicket falling, but Hoggard's taking of Clarke's and then Gilchrist's scalps on either side of the lunch break swung the initiative back into England's hands.\nThe injury to Simon Jones became somewhat obvious as the pacers struggled to capture the magic that Jones had created the previous day that had forced Australia to follow on. Despite this, the Australian run rate remained low as both sides stared each other down. Mistakes by Geraint Jones and Pietersen were quickly nullified by the dismissal of Warne for 45 and Kasprowicz for 19, and after a few overs' resistance, Tait was bowled middle stump for 4, leaving 129 for the English to chase after tea.\n\nEngland then proceeded to send the game into a nailbiter; Trescothick started the chase positively, scoring 27 from 22 balls, out of 32 scored while he was at the crease. Then English wickets fell quickly as Warne took three wickets: Trescothick, Vaughan (0) and Strauss (23). Lee dismissed Ian Bell (3) and at 57 for 4 England were in trouble. Flintoff (26) and Pietersen (23) then steadied the ship with an invaluable partnership of 46 before both fell in quick succession to Lee. Despite Geraint Jones' dismissal by Warne for 3, the partnership of Ashley Giles (7 not out) and Hoggard (8 not out) guided England home. Man of the match honours went to Flintoff, but more importantly this gave the English a crucial 2–1 lead heading back to London for the fifth and final Test, ensuring that they could not lose the series. However, with the Ashes going to Australia in the event of a drawn series, there was still all to play for at The Oval.\n\nTeam changes\n\nAustralia named Glenn McGrath, recovered from an elbow injury, to replace Michael Kasprowicz. England's Simon Jones did not recover from his ankle injury from the previous Test in time to be included in the England team, and was replaced after much speculation by all-rounder Paul Collingwood, in preference to specialist fast bowler James Anderson.\n\nDay 1\n\nThe final match to decide the fate of the legendary Ashes urn finally began, and the proverbial first blood was drawn by England as Michael Vaughan won his third toss of the series (much to the delight of the partisan Oval crowd). Vaughan elected to have his side bat first, and the English first innings got underway. Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss added 82 for the first wicket, as England's batsmen looked to take on the Australians, but subtle spin variations bowled from Shane Warne yielded three wickets as England went to lunch on 115 for 3.\n\nWarne continued after lunch by taking the wicket of Kevin Pietersen for 14. Andrew Flintoff emerged to form a vital partnership of 143 with Strauss, before to falling to McGrath for 72 an hour after tea. Strauss made his second century of the series, before being dismissed by Warne off an acrobatic catch by Simon Katich. The day ended with Geraint Jones and Ashley Giles at the crease, with England 319 for 7. Certain forecasts for London called for showers sometime during the weekend, which, it was thought, might wipe up to a day of action or more from the ledger.\n\nDay 2\n\nDay two began positively for the Australians, with Jones being bowled for 25 off Brett Lee, and Matthew Hoggard managing a meagre 2 before being dismissed by McGrath. However, Giles and Steve Harmison frustrated the Australians by taking the score past 370, before Warne trapped Giles lbw shortly before midday, leaving England all out for 373.\n\nThe Australian first innings got off to a solid start, with Justin Langer forging a 100 partnership with fellow opener Matthew Hayden – the first opening-partnership century of the series by the Australians. Langer played some blistering strokes off Giles' bowling in particular, but survived a sharp chance to Trescothick at first slip. The Australians were offered the light immediately after tea, despite the English protesting and wanting to bowl Giles. The Australians accepted it, and the light never improved, with light rain coming down later. Thus, the day concluded with Australia 112/0, 261 runs behind England.\n\nDay 3\n\nAfter a delay for wet field conditions, the third day began with a flurry of action, as both Langer and Hayden had close calls with lbw appeals, which replays suggested should have been out, and shies at the stumps that just missed. However, no batsman was given out in the morning session, where only 14 overs of play was possible, owing to rain. Australia added 45 runs in that time.\n\nAfter lunch Hayden and Langer continued their solid batting, frustrating the England bowlers, with Langer reaching his 22nd Test century. Shortly afterwards, England gained a minor victory as Harmison dismissed Langer, who departed to a rapturous ovation. Ricky Ponting should then have been dismissed for a bat-pad catch off Giles, but Bowden turned down the appeal. Hayden also achieved three-figure success later in the day – his first century for over a year, while Flintoff's hostile and accurate bowling was rewarded with the wicket of Ponting, caught at slip by Strauss. With this wicket, Flintoff equalled Ian Botham's hitherto unique achievement of 300 runs and 20 wickets in an Ashes series. Flintoff had a later appeal for a catch behind turned down by Rudi Koertzen, despite it hitting the bat.\n\nThe Australian batsmen once again ended the day early by accepting an offer of bad light, bringing a much-interrupted day to a close after only 45.4 overs. Thanks to dogged batting and at least four umpiring decisions in their favour on the third day, they finished 96 runs behind with eight wickets of their first innings intact.\n\nDay 4\n\nThe fourth day started brightly for England, Damien Martyn hooking a short ball from Flintoff straight into the hands of Collingwood, in the third over of the day, having added only one to his overnight score of nine. Further wickets fell, with an excellent knock by Hayden been brought to an end by Flintoff, who continued with impetus and trapped Katich lbw for 1, before Hoggard had Adam Gilchrist lbw with an inswinger at the stroke of lunch. Gilchrist, however, had added a quick 23 that could be vital, as Australia went into the pavilion 17 runs behind with four wickets in hand.\n\nHowever, it only took six post-lunch overs for England to end the Australian effort. Jones dropped a catch off Michael Clarke's bat, but it did not prove to be crucial, as Clarke was lbw to Hoggard in the next over. Warne and McGrath both went for ducks, caught off a mistimed hook and in the slips respectively. Finally Hoggard had Lee (6) caught in the deep and Australia were bowled out for 367. Flintoff finished with five wickets, the second five-for of his career, while Hoggard's four for 97 was his best return of the series.\n\nThus England, who had expected to begin their second innings chasing a hundred runs or more, were actually leading by six as they took up their bats in mid-afternoon. Australia took a very quick wicket, that of Strauss, who was dismissed again by Warne, caught bat-and-pad by Katich for a solitary run. The wicket was Warne's 167th against England, equalling Dennis Lillee's Ashes bowling record. 11 balls after this dismissal, umpires Rudi Koertzen and Billy Bowden judged it unfair to continue play, owing to inadequate light. One additional session of play was however subsequently possible, taking England to a 40-run lead without further loss, before poor light ended the day.\n\nDay 5\n\nThe fifth day began with the game still finely balanced. Ponting put his trust in his two proven wicket takers: McGrath and Warne. England batted well for 40 minutes, with Vaughan taking the game to the Australian bowlers, but McGrath produced two beautiful outswingers to dismiss him and Ian Bell (for a pair) with consecutive deliveries. The Australian charge was diminished by a couple of uncharacteristic dropped catches, but Warne and McGrath combined to take four wickets before lunch, leaving England 133 runs ahead with five wickets remaining.\n\nThe afternoon session was anchored by Pietersen, the beneficiary of three dropped catches, who scored his maiden Test century, with obdurate support from Collingwood and Giles. The session saw only two wickets fall, Collingwood was caught acrobatically by silly mid-off Ponting for 10, and Jones (1) decisively bowled when he was deceived by a rapid Shaun Tait delivery. Pietersen was finally dismissed for 158, a superlative innings including 15 fours and 7 sixes, while Giles added 59 and Harmison was dismissed for a duck to bring Australia in to bat with fewer than 19 overs remaining.\n\nAs the Australians began their innings, it was clear that not enough time remained for them to make up the 341 runs by which they trailed. Almost immediately they were offered the light; and having accepted it, both teams had to return to the dressing rooms to wait for a formal finish. The situation became somewhat farcical. With the match effectively over, the crowd were eager for the Ashes to be presented to England, and the celebrations to begin. After a period of some uncertainty and confusion, at 18:17 BST umpires Koertzen and Bowden removed the bails and pulled up the stumps to signal the end of the match. Australia had scored just four leg byes in their second innings, making it the only innings in Test cricket history in which every run was an extra. With no result in this fifth and final Test, England took the series 2–1, regaining the Ashes for the first time since 1987.\n\nPietersen, having scored his maiden Test century at a crucial point, was voted Man of the Match by Channel 4 viewers. Flintoff was chosen by Australian coach John Buchanan as English Man of the Series while English coach Duncan Fletcher selected Warne as the Australian Man of the Series. The new Compton–Miller medal for the overall man of the series (as selected by each side's chairman of selectors: Trevor Hohns and David Graveney) was also presented to Flintoff. Finally, the replica urn was presented to Vaughan, thus ending the series in favour of the home side.\n\n\nImmediately following the final match, Elizabeth II sent a congratulatory memo to Michael Vaughan and the team, saying: \"My warmest congratulations to you, the England cricket team and all in the squad for the magnificent achievement of regaining the Ashes... both sides can take credit for giving us all such a wonderfully exciting and entertaining summer of cricket at its best.\"\n\nPolitical leaders like Prime Minister Tony Blair, Conservative leader Michael Howard and Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy also sent their congratulations. Blair stated that \"By bringing the Ashes back after so long, you have given cricket a huge boost and lit up the whole summer\".\n\nHoward added \"... Vaughan, his team, and all involved, should be proud of this achievement and the manner in which they have played during this extraordinary summer of excitement and tension.\"\n\n\"England's victory is historic, and I send hearty congratulations to the team... It has been impossible not to get caught up by the excitement and sense of good will in the past few days,\" stated Kennedy.\n\nOn the other end of the ledger Australia's Prime Minister, John Howard (who was in New York for a UN summit and was given the bad news by an aide during a luncheon with the Asia Society) was gracious in his congratulations to England.\n\n\"Look, there's natural disappointment but it's a situation where you give credit to the team that won,\" Howard stated, noting that there would not be a national day of mourning. \"They will no doubt celebrate and that will be difficult for some, but that's the nature of these contests and we should not take anything away from England...They played very well. It's the best team that England has had for a very long period of time.\"\n\nOn Tuesday 13 September, England, along with their Women's Ashes-winning counterparts, were feted with a 90-minute bus tour from Mansion House to Trafalgar Square, where they were greeted by tens of thousands of Londoners and cricket fans in a celebration of their momentous achievements (to the surprise of Matthew Hoggard, who expected \"three men and a dog\").\n\nThousands of people also lined the streets along the parade route as the two buses made their way to Trafalgar Square, as the team soaked up the feting. While the rest of the team simply enjoyed the sights, 5th Test Man-of-the-Match Kevin Pietersen sprayed champagne from the bus onto joyous revelers on the street, while wicketkeeper Geraint Jones held onto a Dalek doll with the words \"Australians exterminated\" attached to it.\n\nAt Trafalgar Square, the crowd was treated to a victory celebration for both England teams, and before the ceremony closed the square broke into a rendition of \"Jerusalem\", which had become an unofficial hymn for the team during the 5th Test. Interviews were carried out with all members of the men's team and Clare Connor, the captain of the women's team, by David Gower and Mark Nicholas, while the ceremony was broadcast live in the UK on BBC One, Channel 4 and Sky Sports News and around the world. Afterwards, the side was entertained by the Prime Minister as guests of honour at 10 Downing Street, then returned the urn to its sacred home at Lord's for safekeeping.\n\nAlmost immediately criticism began in Australia; the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" immediately took issue with the fact that not only was captain Ricky Ponting out-thought by his opposite number Vaughan but the side was too old and simply did not score the runs when they were needed. \"The Age\" of Melbourne criticised the team for opening their big mouths once too often, hitting at Australia's earlier whitewash boast. Psychological warfare, \"The Age\" went on to state, is great when it works but when it backfires those who are responsible ought to be brought to account.\n\nFormer fast bowler Dennis Lillee was particularly scathing. Writing in Perth's \"The West Australian\", he stated that all who perpetrated this \"disaster\" must be sacked and Shane Warne be appointed the captain in place of Ponting (because of how Warne had delivered time and again in the series). Losing to other sides is not the end of the world, stated Lillee but losing the Ashes is.\n\nFormer captain Steve Waugh defended the side, calling it \"a very good side, a really experienced side. They will be disappointed but they will move on from it\" he said, but also conceding that the selectors were likely to ponder a few changes given that only three of the Australia team at The Oval were aged under 30. \"They'll have a couple of players in mind which they will bring in the side over the next couple of years\".\n\nAlong with Waugh, selector and former batsman David Boon defended their selections. \"Sometimes you're going to have to make a hard decision to keep a subtle rotation going through so you don't have mass retirements...But you've also got to pick the best cricket team you possibly can to represent your country\", he stated. \"If we keep producing cricketers who are 25 plus, they're mature, they're ready to play, they've still got a seven or eight-year career, then we're doing OK.\"\n\nPonting was confronted by a large media pack shortly after his arrival at Sydney Airport and said he wasn't aware of Lillee's comments. \"I'm not concerned about those things. As long as I am doing the right thing by everyone in my dressing room as the team and the coaching staff, well then that's all I can do... But as long as I am looking after the guys in my dressing room, then I'll be happy,\" Ponting stated, adding that he wished to remain captain.\n\nPonting also responded to Lillee's comments that Warne should be captain, and that he made more decisions than Ponting during the series: \"I like to talk to a lot of guys out on the field and use their ideas and thoughts. I'll go to Gilly (Adam Gilchrist) and even Matty Hayden, Justin Langer, Damien Martyn... The way I think is not going to be right 100 percent of the time, but that's the way I do it. Warne has got a cricket brain as good as anybody around. But I wouldn't agree [he was the pseudo captain].\"\n\nRegardless, when the Australian side for the Johnnie Walker ICC Super Series was announced, three members of the Ashes-losing side were dropped: Damien Martyn was retained only for the ODI squad, while Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz were dropped altogether. Brad Hodge, Stuart MacGill and Shane Watson were added in their places. While Cricket Australia officials assured that these omissions were not a signal that the Test careers of these three players were over, many experts said otherwise. However, all three players made successful returns to the Test team in early 2006. Lillee once again called for the replacement of Ponting as captain with Warne after the squad announcement, however this was once again rejected.\n\nWith England's victory in the series, the top of the ICC Test Championship rankings ladder changed slightly as the English closed in on the top-ranked Aussies. In a BBC interview the week after the series, Simon Jones claimed that the English should one day be regarded as the best, despite statistics and the Test Championship rankings speaking otherwise.\n\n\"The Ashes series was talked about so much. People were wondering if England could do it and Glenn McGrath said Australia would win 5–0, but we beat them 2–1 and could have been 3–1 up after Old Trafford,\" Jones told the BBC. \"Australia are statistically the best side in the world, and rightly so. They've played so much great cricket over the past 10 years and built up an advantage on the points system... But I think that's changing and hopefully we will have the mantle one day.\"\n\nMeanwhile, as Pakistan and India prepared for the Ashes keepers' visit in the winter, with the Pakistanis relishing the opportunity to test their mettle against the side that took down the Australians, Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer stated, \"England have done well but they have still to create that aura of invincibility of the West Indies of the 1970s and 80s and Australia recently. The side which does well in all three departments will win the series and we have to be very disciplined against England, who have quality batsmen and bowlers.\" Pakistan would later defeat England at home with a 2-0 margin.\n\nFollowing their performances in the series both Andrew Flintoff and Michael Vaughan were given the Freedom of the City in their home towns of Preston and Sheffield.\n\nOn 29 September, the Royal Mail issued a set of four stamps commemorating the Ashes victory. The stamps cost 68p, which is, incidentally, the cost of sending first-class mail to Australia.\n\nIn the 2006 New Year Honours, 11 of the 12 playing members of the England team were awarded the MBE, with captain Vaughan awarded the OBE, for their roles in the successful Ashes victory. There was some critical comment that the limited role of some did not warrant the honour.\n\nHowever, after the following series in which Australia regained the Ashes in a 5–0 whitewash, the English public began to criticise the celebrations of the previous year. This issue also flared up during the Test series when Warne commented on Paul Collingwood's MBE for scoring 17 runs during the 2005 series. Former England captain Geoff Boycott criticised the fact that the MBE had been awarded to the whole side when Warne, who had already taken over 600 wickets by then, had not been honoured.\n\n"}

In this episode a visitor from the Gamma Quadrant, whom Odo arrests for murder and then must extradite, claims he has met a Changeling before.\n\nDuring a business transaction between unscrupulous bar operator Quark and a pair of Miradorn twins, a visitor from the Gamma Quadrant, Croden, attempts to steal a valuable item. Odo intercedes, but not before one of the twins is killed. Odo takes Croden into custody, while the remaining twin, Ah-kel, vows vengeance. \n\nCroden makes several comments to Odo regarding Changelings. This piques Odo's interest, as he has never encountered another shape-shifter. Croden claims there were once shape-shifters on his homeworld, who were persecuted and driven off the planet. He claims to know of a place where they still exist, and tried to tempt Odo by offering to bring him to this colony. Odo is dubious of Croden's stories until Croden shows him a necklace with a stone that changes shape. Dr. Bashir examines it and tells Odo that, given its composition, it could be distantly related to Odo.\n\nCroden's homeworld demands his return, and Commander Sisko sends Odo to return him. Ah-Kel intimidates Quark into revealing that Odo has taken Croden to the Gamma Quadrant, and he pursues them to exact vengeance on Croden.\n\nIn the runabout shuttle, Croden tells Odo that he was a political prisoner on his home planet, and most of his family was killed by the government. When Ah-Kel appears in pursuit, Odo is forced to release Croden to assist in evading Ah-Kel's ship. Croden navigates the Chamra Vortex, an asteroid field filled with unstable pockets called \"toh-maire\", and lands on a planet he claims contains the Changeling colony. On the surface, Croden's eagerness reignites Odo's doubt. Odo demands the truth of Croden's stories. Croden reveals that he has never actually met a Changeling; the shapeshifting stone he showed Odo was bought at a marketplace. Croden uses the stone to open a chamber he had left on the planet's surface, containing his daughter, whom he had put into stasis.\n\nAh-Kel fires on the planet, prompting the three to return to the ship. A falling rock incapacitates Odo and Croden carries him back to the ship. In the Vortex, Odo tricks Ah-Kel into firing on a pocket of \"toh-maire\", destroying the pursuing ship.\n\nUltimately, Croden decides to answer for his crime on his homeworld and asks Odo to care for his daughter; but Odo, indebted to Croden, finds a Vulcan ship that agrees to take Croden and his daughter back to Vulcan. Croden gives Odo his necklace containing the Changeling stone as a sign of thanks.\n\nIn 2015, Geek.com recommended this episode as \"essential watching\" for their abbreviated \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\" binge-watching guide.\n\n"}

He was a friend of Charles Dickens and many other literary and artistic figures.\n\nHe was born at Dickleburgh, near Diss, Norfolk. At the age of fourteen he began working as an architectural and topographical draughtsman for the antiquary John Britton. Afterwards he contributed designs to be engraved in the annuals then so popular, then progressed into watercolour painting, becoming an associate of the Royal Watercolour Society in 1822, and a full member in 1833. In 1850 he withdrew from active connection with this society, and took to painting in oil. His most fertile period was between 1833 and 1850. At the Paris Exhibition of 1855 he received one of the five first-class gold medals awarded to British painters. He also enjoyed professional honors in Amsterdam and in Belgium. Among his leading works are \"The Murder of the Bishop of Liege\", \"The Armourer relating the Story of the Sword\", \"The Assassination of the Regent Murray by Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh\", and (in oil) \"A Terrible Secret\".\n\nHe was largely employed by publishers, illustrating the \"Cathedral Antiquities of England\" produced by John Britton, the Waverley Novels, and the \"Historical Annual\" of his brother Richard Cattermole (his scenes from the wars of Cavaliers and Roundheads in this series are among his best engraved works), and many other volumes besides. He collaborated on illustrations for Dickens's \"The Old Curiosity Shop\" and \"Barnaby Rudge\". Cattermole specialized in rendering scenes of chivalry, of medievalism, and generally of the romantic aspects of the past.\n\nCattermole is buried in West Norwood Cemetery, near the tomb of his first employer John Britton.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2178304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2178304", "title": "Disconnector", "text": "Disconnector\n\nIn electrical engineering, a disconnector, disconnect switch or isolator switch is used to ensure that an electrical circuit is completely de-energized for service or maintenance. Such switches are often found in electrical distribution and industrial applications, where machinery must have its source of driving power removed for adjustment or repair. High-voltage isolation switches are used in electrical substations to allow isolation of apparatus such as circuit breakers, transformers, and transmission lines, for maintenance. The disconnector is usually not intended for normal control of the circuit, but only for safety isolation. Disconnectors can be operated either manually or automatically.\n\nUnlike load switches and circuit breakers, disconnectors lack a mechanism for suppression of electric arcs, which occurs when conductors carrying high currents are electrically interrupted. Thus, they are off-load devices, with very low breaking capacity, intended to be opened only after current has been interrupted by some other control device. Safety regulations of the utility must prevent any attempt to open the disconnector while it supplies a circuit. Standards in some countries for safety may require either local motor isolators or lockable overloads (which can be padlocked).\n\nDisconnectors have provisions for a lockout-tagout so that inadvertent operation is not possible. In high-voltage or complex systems, these locks may be part of a trapped-key interlock system to ensure proper sequence of operation. In some designs, the isolator switch has the additional ability to earth the isolated circuit thereby providing additional safety. Such an arrangement would apply to circuits which inter-connect power distribution systems where both ends of the circuit need to be isolated.\n\nA switch disconnector combines the properties of the disconnector and the load switch, so it provides the safety isolation function while being able to make and break nominal currents.\n\nDisconnectors can be classified into various types based upon their constructional features and mounting arrangement. The major types of disconnectors are:\n\n\nThese are selected based upon the sub-station layout, clearances available and space constrains.\n\nIn a disconnecting circuit breaker the disconnectors are integrated in the breaking chamber, which eliminates the need for separate disconnectors. The intention of this combined device is to decrease maintenance and increase availability and reliability. The usage of this device instead of a disconnector is limited due to the fact that the open gap is not clearly visible and many doubts in term of safety arise during maintenance activities. Where it is adopted the earthing switch must be used and the performance must be increased by the typical value.\n\nThe open-air disconnecting switches typically need maintenance every five years (every two years under very polluted conditions), while circuit breakers have maintenance intervals of 15 years.\n\n\n\n"}

In a career spanning more than 40 years, Nieve has been a member of Elvis Costello and the Attractions, the Imposters and Madness. He has also experienced success as a prolific session musician, featured on a wide array of other artists' recordings.\n\nIn 2003, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Elvis Costello and the Attractions.\n\nNieve was born in London, England, and attended the Royal College of Music, but dropped out in 1977 to join Costello's backing band the Attractions. Nason received his musical moniker \"Nieve\" (pronounced \"naïve\") while on the Attractions' first tour for Stiff Records. It was bestowed by tourmate Ian Dury who had been astonished by Nason's innocent query, \"What's a groupie?\" Before that, at least briefly, he had been using the stage name \"Steve A'dore\" (a pun on stevedore).\n\nNieve played piano, organ and other keyboard instruments on most of Costello's projects over the next ten years, including the albums \"This Year's Model\" (1978), \"Imperial Bedroom\" (1982) and \"Blood & Chocolate\" (1986). On the 1984 Costello album \"Goodbye Cruel World\" and its accompanying tour, he was credited as \"Maurice Worm.\" His instrument credit on the album was not for playing keyboards, but for providing \"random racket\". He wrote some material on The Attractions' Costello-less album, \"Mad About the Wrong Boy\" under the name Norman Brain, in collaboration with his then girlfriend, Fay Hart. (He also wrote other songs on the album as Steve Nieve.)\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Costello began to work less frequently with the Attractions and stopped working with them entirely between 1987 and 1993. During this period, Nieve focused on session work for other artists (the Neville Brothers, Hothouse Flowers, Graham Parker, Squeeze, Tim Finn, Kirsty MacColl, Madness, Nick Heyward and David Bowie). Also in 1986, Nieve formed the group the Perils of Plastic with ex-Deaf School vocalist Steve Allen, releasing three non-charting singles in the UK in 1986 and 1987. Around the same time, he led the house band (billed as Steve Nieve and The Playboys) on the UK TV series \"The Last Resort with Jonathan Ross\".\n\nCostello reunited the Attractions for 1994's album \"Brutal Youth\". Although the reunion was relatively short-lived (they split again in 1996), the Costello/Nieve collaborations never stopped. They have toured as a duo, and Nieve has contributed keyboards to all of Costello's albums since the mid-1990s, including 1998's Burt Bacharach collaboration \"Painted From Memory\", 2001's Anne Sofie von Otter collaboration \"For the Stars\" and 2003's \"North\".\n\nIn 2001 Costello formed a new backing band consisting of Nieve, Attractions drummer Pete Thomas, and bassist Davey Faragher. The band was subsequently dubbed the Imposters. Elvis Costello & the Imposters have toured extensively and released the albums \"When I Was Cruel\" (2002), \"Cruel Smile\" (2003), \"The Delivery Man\" (2004), \"The River in Reverse\" (2006) with Allen Toussaint and \"Momofuku\" (2008), \"National Ransom\" (2010), \"Look Now\" (2018). In 2020 Nieve won a Grammy for his work with Elvis Costello and the Imposters on \" Look Now\".\n\nIn addition to his work with Costello, Nieve has released several solo albums. \"Keyboard Jungle\" (1983) was his first, a combination of classical and ersatz film scores delivered from his beloved Steinway piano. His second album, \"Playboy\" (1987), consisted of solo acoustic piano renditions of rock songs by David Bowie, 10cc, the Specials, X and others, as well as original compositions. Though both albums were released only in the UK by the independent label Demon Music Group, they were critically well received and noted for their \"display [of] the artist's wit, compositional talent and abundant instrumental agility.\"\n\nNieve followed these with the albums \"It's Raining Somewhere\" (1996), \"Mumu\" (2001) and \"Windows\" (2004). His classical opera, \"Welcome to the Voice\", a collaboration with Muriel Téodori, was released on Deutsche Grammophon in May 2007. The score was interpreted by Barbara Bonney, Sting, Robert Wyatt, Elvis Costello, Amanda Roocroft, Nathalie Manfrino and Sara Fulgoni for the voices. For the music the Brodsky Quartet interpreted a written score, while Marc Ribot, Ned Rothenberg and Nieve improvised. Nieve also composed the score to Téodori's film \"Sans Plomb\".\n\nIn 2008 \"Welcome to the Voice\" was premiered at the \"Theatre du Châtelet\" Paris with \"Sting\", \"Elvis Costello\", and \"Sylvia Schwartz\" in the role of Lily. \nIn 2014, he released \"ToGetHer\".\n\nIn recent years, Nieve has lived in France with his wife Muriel Téodori.\n\n"}

A recipient of the U.S. Water Prize and many other awards, the District has a record of 98.5%, since 1994, for capturing and cleaning wastewater from 28 communities in a 411 square mile area. The national goal is 85% of all the rain and wastewater that enters their sewer systems.\n\nWith headquarters and a central laboratory along the Menomonee River near downtown Milwaukee, it has two wastewater treatment plants which are located at Jones Island () in Milwaukee and at the South Shore () in Oak Creek. These facilities were operated by United Water under a 10-year agreement ending March 1, 2008. Veolia Water is the current operator.\n\n\"The world’s first large scale wastewater treatment plant was constructed on Jones Island, near the shore of Lake \nMichigan.\" The primary wastewater treatment plant at Jones Island was one of the first of its kind when the original activated sludge plant was constructed in 1925. MMSD was the first to market biosolids created through this process as a fertilizer under the name \"Milorganite.\" The Jones Island Plant was among the first sewage treatment plants in the United States to succeed in using the activated sludge treatment process. \"It was the first treatment facility to economically dispose of the recovered sludge by producing an organic fertilizer.\" In the early 1980s the plant needed extensive reworking, \"this does not detract from its historic significance as a pioneering facility in the field of pollution control technology.\" It had the largest capacity of any plant in the world when constructed. The 1925 plant has been designated as a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers. MMSD has maintained an inline storage system (ISS) based on tunnels to store and convey wet weather flows, including combined sewage, since 1994. The ISS tunnels have a total capacity of 400 MG and a combined length of over 20 miles. Since 1994, the ISS tunnels have prevented more than 37 BG of CSOs and SSOs from entering area waterways, including Lake Michigan. Between 1994 and 2000, CSOs decreased from 40-60 events per year to an average of 2.5 events per year (WDNR 2001).\n\nFlooding and erosion of the watersheds in the greater Milwaukee area threaten public health and private property. Watersheds boundaries do not necessarily follow municipal boundaries, reducing the risk of flooding requires looking at the watershed as a whole, including the complete river system and its tributaries. The Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District has discretionary authority to maintain the watersheds in the Greater Milwaukee Area and authority to reduce the risk of flooding is in Wis. Stats., sec. 200.31(1). In the past, work has included: rehabilitation and removal of concrete, removal of sediment and flow-impeding objects, and widening floodplains for flood management purposes.\n\nThe Fresh Coast Resource Center (FCRC) helps southeastern Wisconsin improve the health of Lake Michigan through smart use of green infrastructure. The FCRC assists the community by providing the inspiration, education, and tools needed to create successful green infrastructure projects. \n\nIn 2017, MMSD opened the FCRC to empower people, homeowners, businesses, nonprofits, and government to take an active role in protecting our most precious natural resource: water.  By helping the community to protect our rivers and Lake Michigan, we work to achieve our goal of capturing the first 0.5 inch of rainfall in our service area. By capturing the first 0.5 inch of rain, 740 million gallons of water will stay out of our sewers, helping to prevent sewer overflows and reducing runoff pollution.\n\nDiverting combined sewer overflows to waterways is an emergency measure to prevent sewage backups into basements when wastewater treatment facilities reach capacity. MMSD follows the 2014 State of Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Discharge Permit for sewer overflows. Combined Sewer Overflows (CSO) are sewers that are designed to collect rainwater runoff, domestic sewage, and industrial wastewater in the same pipe. When a CSO happens,they post it on their website and have 5 days to report it to the DNR. According to scientists at the UW-Milwaukee School of Freshwater Sciences, bacteria from CSO's only survive for up to 10 days due to the frigid temperatures of Lake Michigan. Combined sewer overflows are 90 to 95% stormwater and groundwater. \n\nMMSD's combined sewer overflows are smaller than those of other cities on the Great Lakes, including Cleveland's and Detroit's, and are similar to that of the smaller city of Grand Rapids. Year-to-year combined sewer overflows vary depending on local rainfall but as a recent example in 2014 MMSD combined sewer overflows totaled 342 million gallons, meaning that 99.5% of the total flow through the municipal sewer system was treated. MMSD’s permit requires that Controlled Sewer Overflows be limited to no more than six overflows per year, consistent with the presumption approach in the CSO Control Policy.\n\nSeparating the sanitary and storm sewers would decrease the amount of water captured and treated, however the amount of pollutants going into our rivers and Lake Michigan would increase. In urban areas with lots of impervious surfaces (buildings, parking lots, streets), there is little opportunity for stormwater to be absorbed into green areas. Resulting in run off with a high degree of pollutants that would further erode water quality. \n\n\"Since 1994, a more than 26-mile- (42-kilometer-) long tunnel has been keeping Milwaukee's sewage from spilling into Lake Michigan. This deep water tunnel—a holding tank on steroids—comprises two legs roughly 300 feet (90 meters) belowground that can hold nearly 500 million gallons (1.9 billion liters) of sewage and storm water during a downpour. And for the last 14 years it has kept 74 billion gallons (280 billion liters) of wastewater out of Lake Michigan, according to Bill Graffin, a spokesman for the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District.\" - David Biello, Scientific American.\n\nThe Deep Tunnel has prevented more than 125 billion gallons of pollution from getting into Lake Michigan. Thanks to the tunnel and many other improvements, MMSD has captured and cleaned 98.4% of all the stormwater and wastewater that's entered the regional sewer system since 1994. The goal nationally is to capture and clean 85% for the more than 700 cities with systems like ours.\n\n\n"}

The 200,000 Vietnamese troops supporting the PRK, as well as Khmer Rouge defectors, had ousted the brutal Democratic Kampuchea regime of Pol Pot, and were initially welcomed by the majority of Cambodians as liberators. Some Khmer, though, recalled the two countries' historical rivalry and feared that the Vietnamese would attempt to subjugate the country, and began to oppose their military presence. Members of the KPNLF supported this view.\n\nOn 5 January 1979 a \"Committee for a Neutral and Peaceful Cambodia\" (\"Comité pour un Cambodge Neutre et Indépendant, CCNI\") was established in Paris composed of Son Sann (a leading Cambodian neutralist, ex-President of the National Bank of Cambodia, and Prime Minister from 1967 to 1968), Sim Var, Yem Sambaur, Hhiek Tioulong, Nong Kimmy, Thonn Ouk and Chai Thoul. It issued a six-point declaration condemning the Khmer Rouge and the \"North Vietnamese Aggression\", urged adherence to the 1954 Geneva Accords and 1973 Paris Peace Conference proposals, demanded an immediate ceasefire in Cambodia, and the establishment of a democratically elected government to be established following a referendum.\n\nVietnam had invaded Democratic Kampuchea in December 1978 and entered Phnom Penh on January 6, 1979. Immediately the Royal Thai Government approached Son Sann with offers of support for a non-communist resistance force. Son Sann, in turn, flew to New York City to ask Prince Norodom Sihanouk (who was preparing to address the UN General Assembly) to lead the KPNLF, but Sihanouk declined and even refused his support.\n\nIn February 1979, General Dien Del and Nguon Pythoureth flew to Thailand to form the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces (KPNLAF). The two went from camp to camp persuading local leaders to join. Those who agreed to fight under Son Sann were Chea Chhut (at Nong Chan), ex-Khmer National Armed Forces Colonel Prum Vith, Ta Maing and Om Luot (at Nong Samet). By mid-1979 there were 1600 armed soldiers in the KPNLAF.\n\nIn August 1979 Son Sann went to Thailand with his sons (Son Soubert and Son Monir), Neang Chin Han (former Director of the Executive Cabinet under President Lon Nol), Madame Suon Kaset Sokhomaly, Colonel Thou Thip, Colonel Ea Chuor Kim Meng, Suon Sophat and Buon Say, all from France. The KPNLF was proclaimed on October 9 at Sok Sann, a camp in the jungles of the Cardamom Mountains that contained \"barely 2000 men\" and was a merger of 13 quite disparate groups such as the Khleang Moeung (500 men), Cobra (led by Colonel Prum Vith) and Khmer Islam Movement, the Prey Veng, the Nationalist Movement, Oknha Son Kuy, Kauv Tjlok, the Khmer Neutralist Movement, the Black Indra, United Free Khmer, ASW, Tonle Bassak, and the Kompong Thom Movement. The following month the first shipment of 3000 rifles arrived from Beijing. Son Sann assumed the leadership of the KPNLF together with an executive committee and a military council.\n\nThe KPNLF was thus established as a right-wing, pro-Western, anti-Communist political faction in opposition to the Vietnamese-installed and backed People's Republic of Kampuchea.\n\nUS President Ronald Reagan authorized the provision of aid to KPNLF in an effort to force an end to the Vietnamese occupation. In 1982, the U.S. government initiated a covert aid program to the non-communist resistance (NCR) amounting to $5 million per year, ostensibly for non-lethal aid only. This amount was increased to $8 million in 1984 and $12 million in 1987 and 1988. In late 1988, the United States pared back CIA funding to $8 million, following reports that $3.5 million had been diverted by the Thai military. At the same time, the Reagan Administration gave new flexibility to the funds, permitting the NCR to purchase US-made weapons in Singapore and other regional markets. In 1985, the United States established a separate, overt aid program to the non-communist resistance which came to be known as the Solarz Fund after one of its chief sponsors, Rep. Stephen Solarz. The overt aid program channeled about $5 million per year of humanitarian aid to the non-communist resistance through USAID.\nSince its beginning, the KPNLF had depended on international financial aid to help maintain their civilian camps and carry out military operations. Sann was critical for gathering this financial aid, as well as increasing international awareness of KPNLF's cause. In fact, in 1982 he went on a fundraising trip to the United States and Europe. Sann was very popular with his quiet, humble demeanor and engaging personality. In addition to Sann's trips, the KPNLF trumpeted their status as the first non-communist anti-PRK faction inside of Cambodia. This increased financial aid because it appealed to the \"Western\" forces that were interested in ousting the Vietnamese yet not supporting the Khmer Rouge. \nIn order to increase their political clout and legitimacy, the KPNLF joined with the Khmer Rouge (at this point in time officially called the Party of Democratic Kampuchea) and Prince Sihanouk's United National Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Co-operative Cambodia (FUNCINPEC) to form the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK). Even though both the KPNLF and FUNCINPEC did not agree with the Khmer Rouge's philosophy and methodology, they still joined the CGDK for the increased international legitimacy and recognition. This increase came because it appeared as if native Cambodians were putting aside their differences and banding together to remove a foreign occupier. In fact, some believe that this coalition was formed in part due to external pressures because the CGDK was allowed to occupy the Cambodian seat in the UN, even though the coalition lacked the normal prerequisites for such recognition.\n\nThe military branch of the KPNLF was the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces (KPNLAF). Established originally in March 1979 by General Dien Del, it was commanded by Sak Sutsakhan from 1981-1992 (with the exception of some power struggles). However, in an individual unit the commander was relatively autonomous, therefore General Sak had the difficult job of coordinating the actions of each unit. This understandably led to a lot of confusion and relative ineffectiveness for large-scale battles. On the other hand, this organization reaped benefits in the form of greater flexibility and mobility of the armed forces.\n\nDespite this military tendency to act in the form of individual unit attacks, occasionally the KPNLAF would join with other separatist forces to launch a large-scale assault on a specific target or area. For example, on March 28, 1986 the CGDK launched a successful raid on Battambang, Cambodia's second largest city.\n\nFor the KPNLAF large-scale military actions were stopped after the Vietnamese dry season offensive in 1984-1985. These attacks were devastating, yet not completely debilitating. Even after the huge loss of approximately 30% of its men and material, the KPNLAF was still able to carry out guerrilla operations for the rest of its existence.\n\nAs with many political groups, the KPNLF had its fair share of party infighting. During its history, two major divides have occurred: one before the Paris Peace Accords in 1991 and one after the UN-backed elections of 1993.\n\nPublic knowledge of the first divide began in late December 1985. On one side was Son Sann, president of the faction. On the other side were the usurpers led by military commander Sak Sutsakhan, his chief of staff Dien Del, and party members Abdul Gaffar Peang Meth and Hing Kunthorn. The dissenters' charges against Sann included an unwillingness to attack the Vietnamese in coordination with Sihanouk's forces and supposed meddling in military affairs, both of which led to greater military impotence. They also accused Sann of being undemocratic and \"ruling with an iron fist.\"\n\nOn Jan. 2 the dissidents released a statement saying that they had control of the faction. Dien Del and Sutsakhan had formed the Provisional Central Committee of Salvation whose function was to command the party. Sann then released a counter-statement saying the actions of Dien and Sutsakhan were both illegal and against the spirit of the party, but that they would still be welcomed back to the party if they stopped this divisive action. On the other hand, for Abdul Gaffar Peang Meth and Hing Kunthorn, Sann believed that disciplinary action was necessary in order to rejoin the party. Sann continued on and said he had the support of the United States, ASEAN, and China (the three major financial backers of the KPNLF).\n\nHowever, the infighting continued because neither side had the power to defeat the other. As the months wore on, Thai authorities became concerned with the KPNLF and in particular, the KPNLAF's abilities to wage war against the PRK because of divided leadership. Therefore, the Thais helped establish (in March 1986) a 10-member provisional military committee without the knowledge of Sutsakhan or Sann. The committee's purpose was to command the military operations of the KPNLAF until the conflict was over. Members of the committee included Dien Del from the Sutsakhan camp and the new head of Sann's Command committee, Prum Vith.\n\nThe dissidence was finally resolved with the help of a third party. While Sann was allowed to keep the title of the presidency and many of the civilian powers that go with it, Sutsakhan retained his military command of both the faction and joint operations between the KPNLAF and FUNCINPEC. However, the peace did not last forever, and after the Paris Peace Accords were implemented Sutsakhan formed the Liberal Democratic Party, an offshoot political branch of the KPNLF.\n\nIn 1991, France and Indonesia called for a peace conference about the civil war in Cambodia. All four factions inside of Cambodia attended, as well as the UN and many prominent foreign nations (e.g., United States, the Soviet Union, China, and the United Kingdom). The goal of the conference was to establish a united, peaceful, and neutral democracy in Cambodia. In October 1991, all attending parties signed the Paris Peace Agreement. \n\nThe agreement called for UN sanctioned elections in 1993 to determine the future government of Cambodia. During the time span in between the signing of the peace agreement and the election, Cambodia would be watched over by the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). The peace agreement stipulated that all four factions must cooperate with UNTAC to slowly disarm their fighting forces. All of the factions did so except for the Khmer Rouge, who then protested and did not partake in the election.\n\nThe necessity to change from a military faction to a political party facilitated a name change. The Khmer People's National Liberation Front became the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party. The name change did not result from a deviation in the platform or structure of the KPNLF, with the exception of the loss of the KPNLAF and the previously mentioned Sutsakhan breakaway party. The BLDP was still led by Son Sann, and in the UN sanctioned elections of 1993 the BLDP won 10 out of 120 seats in the National Assembly.\n\nDue to the inability of any one party to win an absolute majority, the BLDP became a junior member of a coalition government with the Cambodian People's Party (formerly the PRK) and FUNCINPEC. Being a part of the coalition entitled the party to a position in the power-sharing cabinet and an important chair on a commission for the National Assembly (e.g., Ieng Mouly was the Minister of Information, and Kem Sokha was chairman on the National Assembly's Human Rights Commission.)\n\nAs in early 1986, there was a dissension among the party ranks in 1995. However, this time it was not a disagreement between military and political control, but a conflict between two politicians: Son Sann and Ieng Mouly.\n\nAccording to sources, Sann and Mouly had been arguing about different topics for many years. Some of their more vocal disagreements were: Sann being fiercely anti-Vietnamese, Sann's hasty rescinded order to boycott the 1993 UN elections, and Mouly's questioning of the appropriateness of the Cambodian monarchy being involved in the new democracy.\n\nDespite these differences and so many more not mentioned, Mouly and Sann reached a type of power-sharing agreement after the 1993 elections. In exchange for Sann remaining the head of the party, Mouly would get the party's only cabinet position (minister of information). The two decided on this arrangement because it was better to keep the BLDP together, rather than split and lose the party's legislative power, as well as its position in the power sharing coalition.\n\nHowever this arrangement did not last very long, for in 1995 the two sides quarreled. To begin with, Sann constantly supported anti-Vietnamese legislation. This irritated Mouly and his supporters, essentially keeping tension between the two groups from subsiding. The boiling point was finally reached when Sann supporters announced that Mouly had been kicked out of the party. This set off a firestorm and Mouly's side immediately responded in kind, stating the opposite: Sann, instead of Mouly, had been removed from the party.\n\nAs time passed, the latter turned out to be true. On July 9, 1995 Ieng Mouly summoned a special congress of the BLDP in order to select new leadership. Due to the non-attendance of Son Sann and his supporters, Mouly was elected unanimously by the congress. However, shortly after the congress, the BLDP dissolved. Mouly went on to become leader of the Liberal Democratic Party and Sann's supporters created the Son Sann party. Neither side has won a seat in the National Assembly since the split.\n\n"}

{"id": "2178380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2178380", "title": "Induced gamma emission", "text": "Induced gamma emission\n\nIn physics, induced gamma emission (IGE) refers to the process of fluorescent emission of gamma rays from excited nuclei, usually involving a specific nuclear isomer. It is analogous to conventional fluorescence, which is defined as the emission of a photon (unit of light) by an excited electron in an atom or molecule. In the case of IGE, nuclear isomers can store significant amounts of excitation energy for times long enough for them to serve as nuclear fluorescent materials. There are over 800 known nuclear isomers but almost all are too intrinsically radioactive to be considered for applications. there were two proposed nuclear isomers that appeared to be physically capable of IGE fluorescence in safe arrangements: tantalum-180m and hafnium-178m2.\n\nInduced gamma emission is an example of interdisciplinary research bordering on both nuclear physics and quantum electronics. Viewed as a nuclear reaction it would belong to a class in which only photons were involved in creating and destroying states of nuclear excitation. It is a class usually overlooked in traditional discussions. In 1939 Pontecorvo and Lazard reported the first example of this type of reaction. Indium was the target and in modern terminology describing nuclear reactions it would be written In(γ,γ)In. The product nuclide carries an \"m\" to denote that it has a long enough half life (4.5 h in this case) to qualify as being a nuclear isomer. That is what made the experiment possible in 1939 because the researchers had hours to remove the products from the irradiating environment and then to study them in a more appropriate location.\n\nWith projectile photons, momentum and energy can be conserved only if the incident photon, X-ray or gamma, has precisely the energy corresponding to the difference in energy between the initial state of the target nucleus and some excited state that is not too different in terms of quantum properties such as spin. There is no threshold behavior and the incident projectile disappears and its energy is transferred into internal excitation of the target nucleus. It is a resonant process that is uncommon in nuclear reactions but normal in the excitation of fluorescence at the atomic level. Only as recently as 1988 was the resonant nature of this type of reaction finally proven. Such resonant reactions are more readily described by the formalities of atomic fluorescence and further development was facilitated by an interdisciplinary approach of IGE.\n\nThere is little conceptual difference in an IGE experiment when the target is a nuclear isomer. Such a reaction as X(γ,γ)X where X is one of the five candidates listed above, is only different because there are lower energy states for the product nuclide to enter after the reaction than there were at the start. Practical difficulties arise from the need to ensure safety from the spontaneous radioactive decay of nuclear isomers in quantities sufficient for experimentation. Lifetimes must be long enough that doses from the spontaneous decay from the targets always remain within safe limits. In 1988 Collins and coworkers reported the first excitation of IGE from a nuclear isomer. They excited fluorescence from the nuclear isomer tantalum-180m with x-rays produced by an external beam radiotherapy linac. Results were surprising and considered to be controversial until the resonant states excited in the target were identified.\n\n\nSince the IGE from ground state nuclei requires the absorption of very specific photon energies to produce delayed fluorescent photons that are easily counted, there is the possibility to construct energy-specific dosimeters by combining several different nuclides. This was demonstrated for the calibration of the radiation spectrum from the DNA-PITHON pulsed nuclear simulator. Such a dosimeter could be useful in radiation therapy where X-ray beams may contain many energies. Since photons of different energies deposit their effects at different depths in the tissue being treated, it could help calibrate how much of the total dose would be deposited in the actual target volume.\n\nIn February 2003, the non-peer reviewed \"New Scientist\" wrote about the possibility of an IGE-powered airplane, a variant on nuclear propulsion. The idea was to utilize Hf (presumably due to its high energy to weight ratio) which would be triggered to release gamma rays that would heat air in a chamber for jet propulsion. This power source is described as a \"quantum nucleonic reactor\", although it is not clear if this name exists only in reference to the \"New Scientist\" article.\n\nIt is partly this theoretical density that has made the entire IGE field so controversial. It has been suggested that the materials might be constructed to allow all of the stored energy to be released very quickly in a \"burst\". The possible energy release of the gammas alone would make IGE a potential high power \"explosive\" on its own, or a potential radiological weapon.\n\nThe density of gammas produced in this reaction would be high enough that it might allow them to be used to compress the fusion fuel of a fusion bomb. If this turns out to be the case, it might allow a fusion bomb to be constructed with no fissile material inside (i.e. a pure fusion weapon); it is the control of the fissile material and the means for making it that underlies most attempts to stop nuclear proliferation.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2178397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2178397", "title": "Ethnolect", "text": "Ethnolect\n\nAn ethnolect is generally defined as a language variety that mark speakers as members of ethnic groups who originally used another language or distinctive variety. According to another definition, an ethnolect is any speech variety (language, dialect, subdialect) associated with a specific ethnic group. It may be a distinguishing mark of social identity, both within the group and for outsiders. The term combines the concepts of an ethnic group and dialect.\n\nThe term was first used to describe the monolingual English of descendants of European immigrants in Buffalo, New York. The term \"ethnolect\" in North American sociolinguistics has traditionally been used to describe the English of ethnic immigrant groups from non-English speaking locales. Linguistically, the ethnolect is marked by substrate influence from the L1, a result of the transition from bilingualism to English monolingualism.\n\nThe idea of an ethnolect relates to linguistic variation and to ethnic identity. According to Joshua Fishman, a sociologist of language, the processes of language standardization and nationalism in modern societies make links between language and ethnicity salient to users.\nEthnicity can affect linguistic variation in ways that reflect a social dimension of language usage. The way in which ethnic groups interact with one another shapes their usage of language. Ethnolects are characterized by salient features that distinguish them as different from the standard variety of the language spoken by native speakers of the particular language. These features can either be related to the ethnolect’s lexical, syntactic, phonetic and/or prosodic features. Such linguistic difference may be important as social markers for a particular ethnic group.\n\nEthnolect varieties can be further subdivided into two types. One type is characteristic of a specific group, where a majority language currently used by speakers is influenced in terms of lexicon, grammar, phonology and prosody by a minority language associated with their ethnic group but is no longer in active use. Examples include Jewish American English, previous German Australian English and African American Vernacular English. \n\nThe other type, is called a multiethnolect, because several minority groups use it collectively to express their minority status and/or as a reaction to that status to upgrade it. In some cases, members of the dominant (ethnic) group, especially young people, share it with the ethnic minorities in a 'language crossing' situation to express a new kind of group identity. Examples include , Multicultural London English and Singapore English. \n\nUsing ethnolects allow speakers to define their social position, and helps them construct their identity. Subscribing to language features commonly associated with a particular ethnic group works to either affiliate or distance themselves from a particular ethnic group. \n\nEstablishing an ethnic identity through language is not necessarily singular. Studies have found speakers who have melded linguistic features of separate communities together in order to create a mixed ethnic identity. African Americans in rural western North Carolina have been found to adopt both local pronunciation and AAVE vocabulary in their speech. Second-generation Italian Canadians in Toronto have been recorded to participate in a vowel shift that resembles both Italian and Canadian pronunciations. \n\nEthnolects can also serve a communicative purpose in the intergenerational context. Common in new migrant families of non-english language background, ethnolects can be used by the younger generation to communicate with their elders. This usage of ethnolects may be concurrent or in replacement of the community language.Speakers have been found to believe that the use the ethnolect eases communication with the older generations.\n\nThe use of ethnolect may also address bilingual communication in the home, where there is a discontinuity in the language that parents and their children use. Children whose first language are different may pick up terms from their parents’ ethnolect. The two varieties in this case can symbolize a speaker’s multiple identity.\n\nListed below are a few examples of ethnolects, with several linguistic features they display highlighted. These distinguished linguistic features are present in areas such as phonetics, grammar, syntax and lexicon. They are usually brought about by influence of another language - the mother tongue of its speakers. \n\nExample 1\n\nChicano English, or Mexican-American English, refers to the ethnolect spoken primarily by Mexican Americans. Chicano English developed as a result of immigration into the United States in the 20th Century. Some features of Chicano English include: \n\nExample 2\n\nAfrican American Vernacular English (AAVE) is one of most researched and salient ethnic varieties of English. It generally refers to the ethnolect primarily spoken by working or middle-class African-Americans in more informal conversations. Some prevalent features of AAVE include: \n\nExample 3\n\nGreek Australian English refers to the English spoken by Greek immigrants in Australia. It is known and used by the Greek Australians during the last 170 years of settlement. Some salient features of Greek Australian English include:\n\nEthnolects are typically employed by speakers to either decrease or increase social distance with others. Listed below are more atypical manifestations of using ethnolects in order to achieve certain social purposes.\n\nCrossing refers to the use of a language, or aspects of it, by speakers who are not accepted by members of the group associated with the language. In reference to ethnolects, crossing refers to speakers using ethnolects that do not formally belong to them. Considering the inherent connection between ethnolect and ethnicity, crossing is highly contentious as it involves a movement across ethnic boundaries. Speakers are required to negotiate their identity to perform crossing. Beyond being a linguistic phenomenon, crossing has social implications, and community members are generally aware of the sanctions against crossing.\n\nEthnolects may also be rejected by its speakers. This linguistic choice is apparent in ethnic hypercorrection. Ethnic hypercorrection is a subclass of linguistic hypercorrection, and refers to the over-application of certain linguistic markers common in the variety of another group. Speakers belonging to an ethnicity, often a minority group, hypercorrect to draw distance between themselves and their ethnic groups. Often, speakers hypercorrect due to the social prestige associated with the different language varieties. For example, second and third generation Italian and Jewish immigrants in New York were found to have stronger vowel sounds that are distinctive of the New York accent in their speech. (link 19) The vowels they spoke were opposite of what was expected from their Italian and Yiddish ethnicity.\n\nSome twenty-first century linguists object to broader application of the term \"ethnolect\" to describe linguistic differences that are believed to reflect ethnic group affiliation. According to these scholars, this may inaccurately posit ethnicity as the central explanation for linguistic difference, when in fact there may be other variables which are more influential to an individual's speech.\n\nSome scholars also point out that the common use of \"ethnolect\" is used to compare the \"ethnolects\" of ethnic minorities with the \"standard\" speech of ethnic majorities, which is designated as the regional dialect instead of as a majority ethnolect. The ethnolinguistic repertoire approach is therefore proposed as a more effective model in linguistic research that could counteract the problems of the ethnolect approach as listed below.\n\nThe way one speaks can vary widely within any ethnic group on a continuum of styles that could be mixed across variants. Some may employ a few or none of the features in an ethnolect while others may use many. Therefore, it is difficult to draw the line between speakers and non-speakers of an ethnolect. Although qualifications and modifiers are established in definitions to enhance the fluidity of the concept, it is still unable to fully resolve the problem as variation exists in complex and intricate patterns that are unlikely to be fully accounted for in brief definitions.\n\nSpeakers of ethnolects tend to be aware of the differences in their speech compared to others to some extent. They may therefore temper their usage of salient features in their ethnolects when speaking to interlocutors who are not part of their ethnic group and may also be able to code-switch fluently between their ethnolectal variety and Standard English. Speakers who do that are considered to be \"bidialectal\". Yet, the selective use of elements from an ethnolect is not predictable, which then confounds the notion of code-switching.\n\nSome speakers who are not part of a particular ethnic group may also make use of elements of the group’s ethnolect, which can include behaviours like crossing or passing when people imitate an ethnic stereotype or assimilate to an ethnic group’s behaviour to be included. This can be observed in phenomena such as ‘crossing’ in multi-ethnic interactions. For example, elements of AAVE are used by people who have little association with African Americans because of the language's influence in hip-hop. Non-group members may also extensively employ features from an ethnic group’s repertoire in their speech if they spend much of their time with the group members. \n\nIt is difficult to define the ethnic group a person belongs to, especially in Western societies where ethnic groups are porous and fluid. Individuals often shift from one ethnic identity to another as they transition between life stages. Ethnic group membership is constructed not just on the basis of descent but also on the basis of symbolic practices, including language. Viewing ethnic identity as an inheritance that cannot be changed may pose problems. In addition, an increasing number of individuals consider themselves as part of two or more ethnic groups. It is thus difficult to define one’s ethnicity by their parentage or physical features. Ethnic identification also generally involves self-identification of a shared understanding and belonging with culture or language, as well as affirmation from existing members of the existing ethnic group. The factors that determine ethnic identity are ambiguous.\n\nThe final problem lies in the conceptualisation of a given group’s language as a separate ethnic variety like AAVE and Chicano English, or merely as ethnic variation from an abstract norm such as the phonological variation among people of a shared ethnicity. In the ethnolect approach, distinctions are drawn to categorize certain languages spoken as ethnolects (i.e. ethnic varieties) while others are considered as a repertoire of linguistic features associated with the ethnic group that are employed in ethnic variation.\n\n"}

The week is celebrated not just in the Indigenous communities but also in increasing numbers of government agencies, schools, local councils and workplaces.\n\nNAIDOC originally was an acronym for the National Aborigines and Islanders Day Observance Committee. The organising committee behind the day adopted this name in 1991.\n\nHowever, the idea behind NAIDOC goes back to a letter written by William Cooper that was aimed at Aboriginal communities and at churches. It was written on behalf of the Australian Aborigines Progressive Association, an umbrella group for a number of Aboriginal justice movements. The association gathered together a wide circle of Indigenous leaders including Douglas Nicholls, William Ferguson, Jack Patten and Margaret Tucker. In 1937 they were preparing for what would become the famous Day of Mourning in 1938. It not only sparked a very effective one-off protest. It also stimulated a national observance that was at first championed by churches, and is now a national celebration:\n\nThe Day of Mourning before Australia Day 1938 in Sydney by the AAPA and around 100 further Aboriginal people made significant impact on the national conversation and triggered an invitation for Indigenous leaders to meet with Prime Minister Joseph Lyons.\n\nThe message to the churches got through too. Certainly, some churches were observing the day by January 1940 and it was nationally observed by 1946 at the latest.\n\nBy 1957, the leaders of the movement decided to change the date from January to July. The National Aborigines Day Observance Committee (NADOC) formed and the first Sunday in July became a day of remembrance and celebration for Aboriginal people and heritage. In 1991 NADOC became NAIDOC (National Aborigines and Islanders Day Observance Committee), to recognise Torres Strait Islanders and to describe a whole week of recognition, rather than one day. The committee's acronym has become the name of the week itself.\n\nNAIDOC activities are held across Australia, activities include cultural and educational activities in schools and workplaces and public displays. NAIDOC Week activities might include listening to Indigenous Australian music, reading dream time stories, visiting Indigenous Australian websites on the Internet and organising an art competition. \nMajor celebratory events take place in Australia's major cities as well as in larger rural Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, including Alice Springs, Hermannsburg, Shepparton and Mildura.\n\nThe National NAIDOC Awards Ceremony and Ball, celebrating the end of NAIDOC Week festivities is held in a different host city each year.

It is a timed transfer point between northbound trains to Richmond and to Antioch (The timed transfer was at 12th Street/Oakland City Center station until September 13, 2010).\n\nIt is the busiest BART station in both Oakland and the East Bay (just above ), and the 5th busiest BART station overall, with a daily ridership of approximately in .\n\nSunday-only service to the station on the Dublin/Pleasanton line was operated from February 11, 2019 to February 10, 2020.\n\nThe concourse mezzanine is on the first level downstairs, an island platform and two main tracks for trains bound for Richmond and Antioch are on the second level downstairs, and a side platform with one track for trains bound for Warm Springs/South Fremont, Millbrae, and San Francisco International Airport are on the third level downstairs. This station is identifiable by the blue brickwork on the interior. At all times during the day, there are timed cross-platform transfers between the northbound lines, Antioch–SFO/Millbrae and Warm Springs/South Fremont-Richmond.\n\nThe station has six public entrances: two at 20th Street, two at 19th Street, and two at 17th Street (one in an alley connecting to Telegraph Avenue). There is also a direct passageway from the station to a Wachovia Bank building. The Telegraph Avenue entrance was closed from October 14, 2013 to September 30, 2014 for renovations by the City of Oakland.\n\nIn 2013, BART began design of a prototype glass canopy for the station entrance on the northeast corner of 20th Street and Broadway. The canopy would protect the escalator from weather damage, improve lighting, and allow the escalator to be fully closed off when the station is not open. The BART board voted to construct the canopy in January 2014; it was completed in March 2015 and includes real-time train arrival information screens at street level. The canopy reduced escalator downtime by one-third, prompting the installation of similar canopies at downtown San Francisco stations beginning in 2017.\n\nA $32.7 million contract for a renovation project was awarded in July 2019. The three separate paid areas will be consolidated, a new elevator added, and public restrooms reopened. Construction began on January 25, 2020.\n\nThe surface streets around 19th Street Oakland station are a major transfer point for AC Transit buses. The Uptown Transit Center, located on 20th Street west of Broadway, consists of six large shelters built in September 2006 to improve the ease of transfers. A number of routes stop on 20th Street shelters and/or on Broadway at the station:\n\nThe Uptown Transit Center is also a transfer point between three Early Bird Express bus routes: 705 (multiple operators), 708 (WestCAT), and 712 (County Connection).\n\nThe Uptown Transit Center will be the northern terminus of the under-construction East Bay Bus Rapid Transit line.\n\nOakland's Greyhound intercity bus station is located four blocks west at San Pablo Avenue and 20th Street.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2178404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2178404", "title": "Cambodia Town, Long Beach, California", "text": "Cambodia Town, Long Beach, California\n\nCambodia Town (also known as Little Phnom Penh or Little Cambodia) is the official name for a roughly one mile long business corridor along Anaheim Street between Atlantic and Junipero avenues in the Eastside of Long Beach, California. The area has numerous Cambodian restaurants, clothing stores, jewelry stores, and donut shops, as well as churches, temples, and service centers for Cambodian-Americans. There are many other businesses in the area, such as auto repair shops, that are Cambodian-owned.\n\nPrior to the rise of the communist Khmer Rouge in the 1970s, Cambodia was a highly agricultural society that endured ten years of French colonial rule. In 1973, the United States (U.S.) commissioned the Arclight Missions. This operation was a series of bombings targeting the Cambodia-Vietnam border to fight the threat of communism from Vietnam. However, the bombings instead instilled chaos and fear in the civilians of Southeast Asia including Cambodia. These bombings convinced many Cambodians that establishing the Khmer Rouge and a new political system would solve all of their problems. Pol Pot led the Khmer Rouge as a communist group who sought to remove all Western influence in Cambodia and create an equal, agricultural society.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge was able to capture and destroy the old capital city of Odongk on March 1974. This then led to the Khmer Rouge's next action of forcing 20,000 inhabitants into the countryside. The Khmer Rouge formally took control of Cambodia on April 17, 1975 around the time of Cambodian New Year. Cambodia then turned into a classless, institution-less society that forced people to work 12 to 14 hours a day in the labor camps on the countryside.\n\nShortly after taking over the country, the Khmer Rouge clubbed individuals who showed disagreement towards their regime to a painful death. The Khmer Rouge murdered Cambodians for not working hard enough, showing any signs of grief, or being an educated individual. As a result, the Khmer Rouge killed 300,000 to 500,000 Cambodian. When the Vietnamese removed the Khmer Rouge's power in 1979, many Cambodians had already suffered at the hands of the army. During Southeast Asia's political turmoil, the total death toll estimate is 2 million out of 8 million people in Cambodia.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the earliest Cambodians to reside in Long Beach were Cambodian students who attended California State University, Long Beach as part of an exchange program. These students were from wealthy and educated families in Cambodia. A few of these students permanently settled in Long Beach after graduating from college and planted the seeds for a Cambodian presence in Long Beach. Consequently, the next wave of migration occurred in the mid-1970s with those who escaped when the Khmer Rouge first took over Cambodia. Many Cambodians took the chance to go to America in various ways even after the fall of the Khmer Rouge.\n\nThe last wave of Cambodian arrivals to the U.S. occurred under the Refugee Act of the 1980s, which was after the Vietnamese attacked the Khmer Rouge in 1979. This was mostly farmers from small villages with limited educational backgrounds. These refugees came to America to avoid fear and violence imposed on them because of war and genocide. The Cambodian students who had settled in Long Beach in the 1950s and 1960s provided services, such as mental health resources, to assist refugees with adjustment to American society. Overall, these Cambodian refugees came to settle in Long Beach to build a new Cambodian community that was destroyed by violence. Long Beach became a destination that allowed many refugees to start their own businesses and establish cultural legacies due to its affordable property.\n\nAs Cambodian refugees arrived in Long Beach, the Asian population increased between 1980 and 1990. By 1990, the Asian population in Cambodia Town was about 35 percent and has declined since then. According to the 2010 Census, Hispanics composed the majority of all ethnic groups while Asians composed 20 percent, 70 percent of whom identified as Cambodian.\n\nOver half of the Asian population of Cambodia Town is foreign born, and 60 percent of these individuals are United States citizens. This process and rate of naturalization indicates the community's efforts of assimilating to American society.\n\nFrom April to November 1975, approximately 2,000 Cambodians migrated to Camp Pendleton, a military base in Southern California, for refuge. After their time in this resettlement camp, many Cambodian refugees moved to Cambodia Town, Long Beach in search of support, as well as familiar lifestyle and culture.\n\nThrough this process of adjusting to American society, many struggled with various challenges including language barriers, trauma, and violence. Trauma is a highly prevalent issue in the community due to the violence inflicted on Cambodians by the Khmer Rouge. Many Cambodians in Cambodia Town struggled emotionally by having more anxiety and fear in their daily activities because of this trauma. These individuals dealt with insomnia, nightmares, panic attacks, and headaches due to painful memories from the political turmoil in Cambodia.\n\nIntergenerational trauma contributes to behavioral problems during the adolescent years of Cambodian youth. These problems impact the family dynamic by widening the generation gap between parent and child. As a result, unaddressed past trauma links to various issues, which may intensify the violence within the Cambodian community in Long Beach. Despite these challenges of trauma from migration to America, the Cambodian community in Long Beach displays a great amount of strength and resiliency to overcome any obstacle in order to accomplish their goals.\nCambodians received the opportunity to rebuild their lives and community when they came to Long Beach. At the time, Long Beach had many jobs that did not require English proficiency, which granted Cambodians a higher access to work and income. Additionally, cheap and affordable property allowed a few Cambodian refugees to gather funds within their immediate and extended family to establish small businesses, cultural institutions, and homes. The United Cambodian Community (UCC) formed during this time to assist Cambodian refugees with housing, finance, and food (Fig. 9; Fig. 10). These structures and services helped shape the geographic landscape of the local Cambodian community by creating familiar food, pharmacy, and other stores for Cambodians. For example, pharmacies in Cambodia Town provided traditional herbal medicine from Cambodia. These aspects of recreating Cambodia's lifestyle in Cambodia Town, Long Beach is what helped establish many Cambodians' sense of belonging in Long Beach.\n\nCambodia Town's population grew with services, stores, and migration. This population growth created a local network where Cambodian residents could navigate their daily lives while still using Khmer as their dominant language. East Anaheim Street became the main business corridor for these services, restaurants, and resources for Cambodians in Long Beach.\n\nThe initial proposal of designating Cambodia Town in 2000 was rejected because many local residents did not support it. The plan was first brought up by a group of Cambodians who \"don't live here,\" leaving the impression that Cambodians who did not live in the area were trying to claim the space as their own. Thus, some community activists preferred the name Little Phnom Penh because the name does not impose a \"singular national identity\" unlike how the name Cambodia Town implies. Some community members continued questioning any official designation for the area because Long Beach is ethnically diverse. Official recognition for a single ethnic group would reinforce racial tensions between Cambodian and Latino youth that stemmed from cultural differences and social isolation.\n\nThe founders of Cambodia Town, Inc. led a successful attempt to officially designate East Anaheim Street as Cambodia Town. Their attempt included the crucial step of gathering support from community and major stakeholders along East Anaheim Street. The proposal received the unanimous approval by the Housing and Neighborhoods Committee despite dissent and concerns that other minority groups had in regards of being displaced. Community members argued that the designation would not displace other ethnic groups by stating that \"such designations merely call attention to a neighborhood's unique characteristics\". The advocates for the designation also used other established ethnic enclaves as examples of spaces where Asians, Blacks, Hispanics and Whites were able to live and work together. As a result, the Long Beach City Council unanimously approved the concept of Cambodia Town in 2007 – under the condition that it became a Business Improvement District (BID).\n\nMany Latino community members felt intimidated and threatened by the rapid growth of the Cambodian community. Cambodians became increasingly \"confronted by the ethnic racial hierarchy\" that arises in low-income communities due to the lack of resources. Cambodian gangs began forming as a method of resiliency. Young Cambodians gravitated towards gangs in hopes to reconcile their conflicting American and Cambodian identities. The lack of educational support within the Long Beach school system for Cambodians also contributed towards high rates of gang participation. In addition, gang participation also correlates to mental health because unaddressed intergenerational trauma among Cambodian youth caused many to search for support from gangs as a coping mechanism; 67 percent of Cambodians suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, while 51 percent suffer from severe depression.\n\nGang activity in Long Beach and Cambodia Town was most active from 1989-1995, through street fights, drive-by shootings and killings. In \"American by the number pass or fail in Cambodia Town,\" one of the interviewees stated that \"we had to protect ourselves,\" when talking about the difficulties of growing up in the United States. In a survey conducted in Cambodia Town, more than half of the participants reported public safety as a major concern. Many of these respondents cited gang activity, theft, violence, and substance abuse as issues that their families continually encountered. However, rates of crime and violence have decreased in the community in recent years. Various community-based organizations such as UCC consistently reach out to the younger generations to guide them towards academic attainment (Fig. 9; Fig. 10).\n\nThe Cambodian New Year, called Choul Chnam Thmey in Khmer, takes place annually from April 14 to April 16. In Cambodia, Choul Chnam Thmey traditionally signifies the shift from the height of the hot, dry season to the monsoon rains that will wash away the dust and bring nourishment to the fields. This transformation is said to be accompanied by divine beings, known as Tevoda, who migrate in a cycle to watch over the renewal in nature.To celebrate Khmer New Year you May go to the Mark Twain Library\n\nThe Cambodian New Year festival in Cambodia Town is a community gathering in the streets and features a cultural parade. This celebration showcases traditional garments and performances (e.g. classical dancing and drumming), flags and symbols of Cambodian cultural pride, and representatives of local organizations and businesses (Fig. 11). Additionally, the celebration exhibits the ethnic diversity of the enclave as the event often includes monks, Cambodian and Black Christian ministers, and paleta vendors.\n\nAnother well-known local event is the annual Cambodia Town Film Festival which was founded by Cambodian American filmmaker Caylee So and hip-hop artist praCH Ly. The event features films from both established and emerging filmmakers whose works deal with the Cambodian experience. The festival includes screenings, discussions, and question-and-answer sessions with those who were involved in the film productions.\n\nWell-known community agencies in Cambodia Town include the UCC, Khmer Girls in Action (KGA), the Homeland Cultural Center, and the Neighborhood Services Bureau. These organizations work to empower Cambodian Americans and other marginalized ethnic communities in the surrounding area through cultural education, community assistance, and development.\n\nThe Cambodia Town business corridor outlines roughly the 1.2 mile stretch of East Anaheim Street just north of downtown Long Beach and east of the 710 freeway. This location is accessible by the Long Beach Transit bus system and the Los Angeles Metro Blue Line. The area consists of Cambodian liquor stores, gift shops, jewelry stores, markets, and restaurants (Fig. 6). The area also consists of many Latino-owned businesses and restaurants (Fig. 7; Fig. 8).\n\nOne of the most well-known Cambodia Town restaurants is the Phnom Penh Noodle Shack, established in 1985. Phnom Penh Noodle Shack started as a modest, family-run restaurant, but over the years has garnered mass appeal from food critic reviews and social media.\n\nThe markets within Cambodia Town reflect the diversity of Asian ethnicities in Long Beach and carry key ingredients for a variety of cuisines including Khmer, Vietnamese, Thai, Korean, Japanese, and Chinese food. The stores provide ethnic foods ranging from ready-made meals to cooking ingredients that cater to all Asian ethnic groups of Cambodia Town (Fig. 5). These markets also introduce Cambodian and Asian ethnic foods to the non-Asian ethnic groups of the community.\n\nCambodia Town's high poverty rate is partially due to low employment rates caused by language barriers and low educational attainment. In the United States, 54 percent of Asians hold a bachelor's degree, while only 10 percent of Asians in Cambodia Town hold a bachelor's degree. About 43 percent of Cambodians reported to having attended college but not earning a degree, thus implying high drop-out rates. In the United States, less than one-third of Cambodians hold less than a high school degree. Data aggregation consolidates the Cambodian experience with the general Asian population's experiences. Because rates of Asian educational attainment are so high, the low educational attainment of Cambodians is ignored. Cambodian youth are not provided the necessary resources, such as counseling or tutoring, to address specific issues that pertain to the Cambodian community.\n\nDue to resettlement, the Cambodian community is currently facing many challenges such as trauma and poverty. Poverty imposes stress on individuals, which creates individual trauma such as having financial insecurity. The complexity and interconnections of these issues contributes to the cycle of poverty and violence by hindering economic mobility. Poverty imposes a challenge for social mobility because other challenges build upon poverty such as educational attainment.\nThe median household income in Cambodia Town is $34,000, which is lower than the $56,000 median income for Los Angeles County. Moreover, Asians in Cambodia Town on average earn roughly $14,600 less than Asians in Los Angeles County. Additionally, one-third of all residents live below the poverty line – about two times higher than that of Los Angeles County (Fig. 3).\n\nIncome and poverty are both interconnected with employment outcomes such as having labor force participation rate around 34 percent in Cambodia Town. Consequently, Cambodia Town has an unemployment rate of 15 percent. With these financial barriers, residents must dedicate more time into finding and working at lower-paying jobs.\n\nFew households own a home in Cambodia Town, which highlights the high renter-occupied numbers and the lack of home opportunities (Fig. 2). About 61 percent of Cambodia Town residents are renters. Most resident are low-income, which causes many to devote most of their time and income to rent. Individuals with a high rent burden are described as any renters who dedicate more than 30 percent of their income to paying rent; in Cambodia Town, 62 percent of renters have a high rent burden. This prevalence of poverty and inability to purchase homes within the Cambodia Town community may be due to low levels of educational attainment, which can inhibit the ability to attain high-paying jobs. As a result, displacement and gentrification are becoming prevalent issues within the community.\n\nCambodia Town is currently undergoing many beautification projects with public investment in murals, bike lanes, parks, and community gardens, among others. This method of beautification is part of an effort to increase safety within the local community. Although beautification does promote safety, it also increases property values, which imposes a new challenge for locals such as a higher cost of living. Consequently, businesses and residents are at risk of being displaced if rent becomes too high. Taken alongside gentrification, beautification creates dissent from housing community development organizations. These groups petition for policies to protect residents from continually increasing rent.\n\n\n"}

It is based on a short story by Yolanda Vargas Dulché, published as a serial on the 1960s Mexican comic book \"Lágrimas, Risas y Amor\". Bárbara Mori stars as the main protagonist, the heroine Rubí.\n\nCanal de las Estrellas aired \"Rubí\" from May 17 to October 22, 2004, with \"Apuesta por un amor\" replacing it. Univision broadcast \"Rubí\" from September 20, 2004 to March 7, 2005, and has named \"Rubí\" as the top telenovela of all time.\n\nRubí Pérez (Bárbara Mori) is a very beautiful but poor woman who is only interested in money. She studies at an exclusive university thanks to the financial support from Cristina (Paty Diaz), her hard-working older sister. Rubí hopes to become rich by befriending rich people. She is best friends with Maribel de la Fuente (Jacqueline Bracamontes), a kind and wealthy young woman. Maribel has a small defect in her leg, which prevents her from having a normal social life. Rubí is actually jealous of Maribel's social status.\n\nRubí meets Maribel's boyfriend Héctor Ferrer (Sebastián Rulli), an architect, and his best friend Alejandro Cárdenas (Eduardo Santamarina), a doctor. Héctor intrigues her because she knows he is very rich, and marrying a rich man has always been her ambition to leave poverty behind. However, she finds herself falling in love with Alejandro. Héctor and Maribel get engaged. Rubí starts dating Alejandro, but when she finds out that he is from a middle-class background and is not rich, she dumps him, though it breaks her heart. Rubi's mother tries to make Rubi see that money is not everything and that she will regret leaving Alejandro. She then sets out to seduce Héctor.\n\nHéctor quickly falls under Rubí's spell. On Héctor and Maribel's wedding day, Héctor leaves a devastated Maribel at the altar and elopes with Rubí instead. Rubí finally has the lifestyle and money that she has always dreamed of. On her wedding night Hector tries to make love to Rubi, Rubi keeps thinking about Alejandro, which makes her run out to the beach crying. Despite this, she is still in love with Alejandro, though he vows to her that he would never forgive her for what she did to Maribel. Hector was supposed to move to New York and work on an important project, but is kicked out after he dumps Maribel at the altar.\n\nHéctor decides to travel the world with Rubí, since he is not entirely sure that she has gotten over Alejandro. They are away for three years. When they return, Rubí discovers that Alejandro is now very rich and has a fiancée named Sonia (Marlene Favela). During an argument with Rubí on a glass bridge, the floor below Sonia shatters, and she falls through the glass and dies. Rubí comforts Alejandro after Sonia's death and seduces him once again. He and Rubí become lovers.\n\nWhen he hears that Rubí was at the scene when Sonia died, he has her arrested for murder. They seemingly hate each other now, but Rubí begins to feel love for him again when she learns that she is pregnant with his child. Because she does not want to divorce Héctor and lose her money and status, she lies and tells Héctor that the baby is his. She is released from jail, since it is ruled that Sonia's death was accidental.\n\nHéctor overhears Rubí telling her friend Loreto (Miguel Pizarro) that the child is actually Alejandro's. Angry and humiliated, Héctor realizes that she never loved him, so he keeps her prisoner in her own home. Rubí manages to get away from Héctor, and the truth about who is the father of her child finally comes out. By now, Alejandro is aware that Maribel has been secretly in love with him and that he too has feelings for her, but he chooses to stay with Rubí for the sake of their baby.\n\nSometime later, Rubí saves her niece Fernanda (Kristel Casteele) from being hit by a car; Rubí is hit instead and has a miscarriage. She blames Héctor for the miscarriage, since he has hit her before because of his jealousy. Héctor tries to prove that Rubí actually lost her baby after being hit by a car, but no one believes him except for Elena (Yadhira Carrillo). She is the assistant to the Count of Aragón and in love with Héctor. Héctor is fatally injured in a car accident and dies before he could tell Alejandro, who is performing Héctor's surgery and trying to save his life, the truth about Rubí.\n\nHéctor left everything in his will to Rubí, much to his parents' chagrin. However, Elena, who hates Rubí, makes sure that all of Rubí's money is lost in the stock market. Alejandro is unjustly charged with intentionally letting Héctor die on the operating table and is arrested. Immediately afterwards, the suspicions are proven unfounded and the charges against him are dropped. Upon his release, he uncovers exactly how Rubí lost their baby. It is also revealed that Elena is pregnant with Héctor's child, though he never knew it.\n\nDisgusted by the damage that she has done, Alejandro pays Rubí a visit one last time and tells her that it is over between them: he has chosen Maribel. Rubí begs him not to leave her, even humiliating herself by getting down on her knees. He leaves her and begins to walk down the stairs. As Rubí follows him, running down the staircase while holding onto the rail and screaming that she will never let him go, she loses her grip on the rail, falls several stories down, and crashes into a glass table below.\n\nTo save her life, doctors have to amputate her leg. When Rubí wakes up, she finds out to her horror that her leg was amputated. Even more devastating, her beautiful face is now full of scars because of multiple glass cuts. Rubí escapes from the hospital.\n\nFinding the wedding date of Alejandro and Maribel, she shows up unseen at the church. She sights a gun through a crack on a door, targeting Alejandro, but she cannot bring herself to shoot him. She then aims at Maribel, but her sister Cristina, Maribel's maid of honor, is in the way and blocking a clean shot. Rubí relents and hides in a corner of the churchyard, despondent.\n\nAfter the wedding, her niece Fernanda wanders over to Rubí's hiding place. Rubí shows her scarred face to Fernanda, but the little girl is not repulsed by it. On the contrary, she feels sympathy for her favorite aunt. When Rubí asks her if she would like to continue meeting her secretly and serve as an instrument to get her revenge and ruin Alejandro's life, Fernanda happily agrees. Rubí limps away, dressed in rags.\n\nYears later, Fernanda (now played by Bárbara Mori) is all grown up, bearing a striking resemblance to Rubí. She visits her aunt, who is living in a one-room flat. After hearing that Alejandro has returned to Mexico after years of living abroad, Rubí tells Fernanda that Alejandro and Maribel have a son, and that her job will be making both Alejandro and his son fall in love with her in order to break Maribel's heart.\n\nAlejandro is now the director of a hospital. One day he finds Fernanda in his office. He is utterly shocked, mistaking her for Rubí. She greets him by pulling him by his tie and bringing him in for what looks like a kiss.

Marriott continued to operate both parks until selling them in 1984. Manufactured by Anton Schwarzkopf of Germany, the two rides were the last “Speedracer” models ever built. The California Whizzer was dismantled in 1988 while the Illinois Whizzer remains in operation, as one of only two Speedracers still in existence worldwide (the other operating as Broca (formerly known as Zambezi Zinger) at Parque Nacional Del Café in Montenegro, Colombia).\n\nFrom the start, both Whizzers suffered from problems with the braking system that would sometimes allow the trains to collide in the station. Unfortunately, no immediate solution was put forth to remedy this problem. In one four-year period, from 1976 to 1979, there were at least 11 recorded instances of station collisions on the California's Great America version, resulting in an unknown number of injuries. There were also two station collisions on the Six Flags Great America ride - both of which occurred less than a month apart in 1976. A total of 31 riders were injured in the Gurnee collisions. Then on March 29, 1980, a 13-year-old boy was killed and eight others injured when two trains collided at the station on the Santa Clara Whizzer. Following the accident, both rides underwent several changes. Seatbelts were added, the braking system was modified and the number of trains that could be run at once was reduced from five to three. Willard’s name was also dropped, leaving the ride’s name as simply \"Whizzer.\" Marriott never reported the potential safety hazard to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which led to a 1981 civil penalty amounting to $70,000.\n\nSix Flags Great America's Whizzer marked its 40th anniversary on May 29, 2016.

In 1927, Wilson earned his bachelor's degree in botany and, in 1934, his master's in biology, both from Stanford University.\n\nFor many years, Wilson had a regular talk show, \"Dig It with Albert\", broadcast on San Francisco's KGO 810 AM. The original show was called \"How does your Garden grow\" and was produced with the help of his manager, George Turkmany. He was on the local PBS TV member station, KQED. He also had a show on KCSM-TV in the late sixties. Wilson was a frequent guest lecturer at local gardening clubs and nurseries throughout the San Francisco Bay area, mentoring and befriending many attendees. He designed and built his home in 1929, on Creek Drive in Menlo Park, California. Wilson was also well known as a landscape architect, having designed Allied Arts and Fremont Park in Menlo Park, and countless backyards and gardens throughout the San Francisco Bay area.\n\n\"How Does Your Garden Grow?\" is one of the gardening books written by Wilson, who was genuinely interested, not just in gardens, but in the gardeners who tended them. Though at one time he spoke positively upon the seemingly miraculous wonders of pesticides and herbicides, Wilson was an early advocate of wearing protective garments while using the primitive agricultural chemicals of the mid-20th century. Later, Wilson's stance changed, because of the health problems and deaths of many his friends and colleagues, caused by chemicals such as DDT. He was also an early advocate of organic gardening.\n\nWilson's dedication to gardening went beyond landscaping, writing and broadcasting. He spoke at many gardening club meetings and nursery seminars. Among the clubs Wilson was involved with was the Foothill Men's Garden Club, which he co-founded in 1962. The club, which encompasses Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, raises money to preserve the natural environment through the sales of members' homegrown products in an annual garden sale.\n\nWilson died at age 93 after apparently falling down a steep ravine bank into San Francisquito Creek, near his Menlo Park home. In 1996, the 32nd annual Foothill Men's Garden Club show was dedicated to Wilson. \"Dig it with Albert\" was remembered with a collection of photos of the beloved gardening expert and writer.\n\nThe Stanford Club of Palo Alto established a memorial fund for Wilson, with proceeds going toward the reconstruction of the Rodin Sculpture Garden at Stanford University.

It was the primary link between two of the world's busiest harbors and the transcontinental rail network. Mostly displaced with the April 15, 2002 opening of the more direct Alameda Corridor, the Harbor Sub takes a far more circuitous route from origin to destination, owing to its growth in segments over the decades. The subdivision was built in this fashion beginning in the early 1880s to serve the ports and the various businesses that developed along it.\n\nFirst built to serve Port Ballona and Santa Monica, located at what is now Playa del Rey, the construction of a larger, better port at Redondo Beach brought an extension to that city in 1888. The early 1900s would see that project eclipsed with the coming of the San Pedro Outer Breakwater and the Port of Los Angeles. By the early 1920s, owing to the development of the area's oil fields, the Harbor Sub was extended through Torrance, Wilmington and on to Long Beach. Development of Watson Yard in Wilmington completed the line. Other than sidings at \"Lairport\" (along the eastern edge of Los Angeles International Airport next to Aviation Boulevard at 120th Street), \"Ironsides\" in Torrance and the line's longest siding at the Alcoa, also in Torrance, the Harbor Sub is completely single-track without signals, compensated with track warrant control via a local dispatcher.\n\nThe line is currently under control of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and is used by BNSF.\n\nA study conducted by the MTA examined the feasibilities of extending the Green Line to Torrance via the Harbor Sub, the creation of a new light rail transit line and even the possibility of a maglev high-speed rail system. The study also examines the possibilities abandonment would create, although a scenario would be highly unlikely.\n\nHeavy construction began in June 2014 to convert the southern portion of the Harbor Subdivision to light rail use as part of the Crenshaw/LAX Line, part of the Los Angeles Metro Rail system. When completed, it will run from Jefferson Park in the north and link with the Metro Green Line at the south end with revenue service projected to begin by 2021. The Harbor Subdivision overcrossing on Century Blvd. and Aviation Blvd. was demolished in late-July 2014 as part of the construction of the Crenshaw/LAX Line.\n\n"}

Particle identification reduces backgrounds and improves measurement resolutions, and is essential to many analyses at particle detectors.\n\nCharged particles have been identified using a variety of techniques. All methods rely on a measurement of the momentum in a tracking chamber combined with a measurement of the velocity to determine the charged particle mass, and therefore its identity.\n\nA charged particle loses energy in matter by ionization at a rate determined in part by its velocity. The energy loss per unit distance is typically called dE/dx. The energy loss is measured either in dedicated detectors, or in tracking chambers designed to also measure energy loss. The energy lost in a thin layer of material is subject to large fluctuations, and therefore accurate dE/dx determination requires a large number of measurements. Individual measurements in the low and high energy tails are excluded.\n\nTime of flight detectors determine charged particle velocity by measuring the time required to travel from the interaction point to the time of flight detector, or between two detectors. The ability to distinguish particle types diminishes as the particle velocity approaches its maximum allowed value, speed of light, and thus is efficient only for particles with a small Lorentz factor.\n\nCherenkov radiation is emitted by a charged particle when it passes through a material with a speed greater than c/n, where n is the index of refraction of the material. The angle of the photons with respect to the charged particle direction depends on velocity. A number of Cherenkov detector geometries have been used.\n\nPhotons are identified because they leave all their energy in a detector's electromagnetic calorimeter, but do not appear in the tracking chamber (see, for example, ATLAS Inner Detector) because they are neutral. A neutral pion which decays inside the EM calorimeter can replicate this effect.\n\nElectrons appear as a track in the inner detector and deposit all their energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter. The energy deposited in the calorimeter must match the momentum measured in the tracking chamber.\n\nMuons penetrate more material than other charged particles, and can therefore be identified by their presence in the outermost detectors.\n\nTau identification requires differentiating the narrow \"jet\" produced by the hadronic decay of the tau from ordinary quark jets.\n\nNeutrinos do not interact in particle detectors, and therefore escape undetected. Their presence can be inferred by the momentum imbalance of the visible particles in an event. In electron-positron colliders, both the neutrino momentum in all three dimensions and the neutrino energy can be reconstructed. Neutrino energy reconstruction requires accurate charged particle identification. In colliders using hadrons, only the momentum transverse to the beam direction can be determined.\n\nNeutral hadrons can sometimes be identified in calorimeters. In particular, antineutrons and Ks can be identified. Neutral hadrons can also be identified at electron-positron colliders in the same way as neutrinos.\n\nQuark flavor tagging identifies the flavor of quark a jet comes from. B-tagging, the identification of bottom quarks, is the most important example.\nB-tagging relies on the b quark being the heaviest quark involved in a hadronic decay (tops are heavier but to have a top in a decay is necessary to produce some \"heavier\" particle to have a subsequent decay into a top). This implies that the b quark has a short lifetime and is possible to look for its decay vertex in the inner tracker. Additionally, its decay products are transversal to the beam, resulting in a high jet multiplicity. Charm tagging using similar techniques is also possible, but extremely difficult due to the lower mass.\nTagging jets from lighter quarks is simply impossible, due to QCD background there are simply too many indistinguishable jets.\n\n"}

Street Law is an approach to teaching practically relevant law to grassroots populations using interactive teaching methodologies. Elements of practical law taught include awareness of human rights/civil rights, criminal breaches and transgression, democratic principles, conflict resolution, the advocacy process, criminal and civil law, employment and labour law, family law, and consumer rights.\n\nThe Street Law approach began in 1972 when Georgetown University Law Center developed a program that sent law students into high schools in Washington, DC to teach practical law lessons to high school students. Street Law, Inc., an outgrowth of the Georgetown program, develops and implements practical law education programs around the world. Street Law, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Its main offices are located in Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.\n\nAlthough Street Law traces its founding to Georgetown Law, it has spread to many law schools globally. Neither Georgetown Law nor Street Law, Inc. exercise vertical or indirect control over local Street Law programs. Within U.S. law schools, Street Law is typically run as a legal clinic or experiential learning module, where law students receive law school academic credit for participation. At other law schools, Street Law is run as a student organization or as an extracurricular activity, typically under direct faculty supervision.\n\nIn recent years, some law societies have adopted a model which sees Street Law run across their jurisdiction. Examples include Ireland and Scotland.\n\nOne core Street Law module is a teaching program wherein law students are sent into community schools to teach high school students age appropriate lessons in the law. Within the U.S., this means that second and third year law students are paired with secondary school classes where they regularly teach courses on law and legal subjects. There is significant autonomy and differentiation in the way that Street Law is taught nationally in the U.S. and globally, and Street Law expressly encourages law schools and law students to experiment with different teaching methodologies to account for different learning styles depending on age, culture, regional and state differences, and so on.\n\nOther Street Law approaches include: teaching Legal Life Skills to underserved populations; Teacher Professional Development courses; partnerships with the legal community (both law firm and corporate) to teach about the law and legal careers to secondary students; teaching about rule of law, democracy and civil rights to populations in countries outside of the US; and publishing teaching resources.\n\nAmong other publications, McGraw-Hill has published a high school social studies textbook using this approach.\n\nMcGraw-Hill has also published a high school government textbook co-authored by Street Law.\n\nMcGraw-Hill also publishes \"Street Law: Understanding Law and Legal Issues\", an informative law-based, civic learning text for use in the community college program.\n\n\n"}

Identification and characterization of antibody binding sites aid in the discovery and development of new therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics. Epitope characterization can also help elucidate the mechanism of binding for an antibody and can strengthen intellectual property (patent) protection. Experimental epitope mapping data can be incorporated into robust algorithms to facilitate \"in silico\" prediction of B-cell epitopes based on sequence and/or structural data.\nEpitopes are generally divided into two classes: linear and conformational. \"Linear epitopes\" are formed by a continuous sequence of amino acids in a protein. \"Conformational epitopes\" are composed of amino acids that are discontinuous in the protein sequence but brought together upon three-dimensional protein folding. B-cell epitope mapping studies suggest that most interactions between antigens and antibodies, particularly autoantibodies and protective antibodies (e.g., in vaccines), rely on binding to conformational epitopes.\n\nBy providing information on mechanism of action, epitope mapping is a critical component in therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) development. Epitope mapping can reveal how a mAb exerts its functional effects - for instance, by blocking the binding of a ligand or by trapping a protein in a non-functional state. Many therapeutic mAbs target conformational epitopes that are only present when the protein is in its native (properly folded) state, which can make epitope mapping challenging. Epitope mapping has been crucial to the development of vaccines against prevalent or deadly viral pathogens, such as chikungunya, dengue, Ebola, and Zika viruses, by determining the antigenic elements (epitopes) that confer long-lasting immunization effects.\n\nComplex target antigens, such as membrane proteins (e.g., G protein-coupled receptors [GPCRs]) and multi-subunit proteins (e.g., ion channels) are key targets of drug discovery. Mapping epitopes on these targets can be challenging because of the difficulty in expressing and purifying these complex proteins. Membrane proteins frequently have short antigenic regions (epitopes) that fold correctly only when in the context of a lipid bilayer. As a result, mAb epitopes on these membrane proteins are often conformational and, therefore, are more difficult to map.\n\nEpitope mapping has become prevalent in protecting the intellectual property (IP) of therapeutic mAbs. Knowledge of the specific binding sites of antibodies strengthens patents and regulatory submissions by distinguishing between current and prior art (existing) antibodies. The ability to differentiate between antibodies is particularly important when patenting antibodies against well-validated therapeutic targets (e.g., PD1 and CD20) that can be drugged by multiple competing antibodies. In addition to verifying antibody patentability, epitope mapping data have been used to support broad antibody claims submitted to the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nEpitope data have been central to several high-profile legal cases involving disputes over the specific protein regions targeted by therapeutic antibodies. In this regard, the Amgen v. Sanofi/Regeneron Pharmaceuticals PCSK9 inhibitor case hinged on the ability to show that both the Amgen and Sanofi/Regeneron therapeutic antibodies bound to overlapping amino acids on the surface of PCSK9.\n\nThere are several methods available for mapping antibody epitopes on target antigens:\n\nOther methods, such as yeast display, phage display, and limited proteolysis, provide high-throughput monitoring of antibody binding but lack resolution, especially for conformational epitopes.\n\n"}

The early patterns of Jewish South African history are almost identical to the history of the Jews in the United States but on a much smaller scale, including the period of early discovery and settlement from the late 17th century to the early 19th century. The community grew tenfold between 1880 and 1914, from 4,000 to over 40,000.\n\nJews were instrumental in promoting the extension of diplomatic military ties between Israel and South Africa. South Africa's Jewish community differs from its counterparts in other African countries in that the majority have remained on the continent rather than emigrating to Israel. Among potential Jewish emigrants, many were likelier to select a destination popular among other South Africans, such as Australia.\n\nThe modern Jewish history of South Africa began, indirectly, some time before the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope, by the participation of certain astronomers and cartographers in the Portuguese discovery of the sea-route to India. Jewish cartographers in Portugal, members of the wealthy and influential classes, assisted Bartolomeu Dias and Vasco da Gama who first sailed around the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 and 1497. Portugal's baptised Jews were still free until the Portuguese Inquisition was promulgated in 1536.\n\nIn 1652, the Dutch East India Company began the first permanent European settlement of South Africa under Jan van Riebeeck. It has been theorised that \"a number of non-professing Jews\" were among the first settlers of Cape Town. Non-Christian migration to the Dutch Cape Colony was generally discouraged until 1803.\nThere were Jews among the directors of the Dutch East India Company, which for 150 years administered the colony at the Cape of Good Hope. \nDuring the seventeenth and the greater part of the 18th century the state religion \"alone\" was allowed to be publicly observed; but on 25 July 1804, the Dutch commissioner-general Jacob Abraham de Mist, by a proclamation whose provisions were annulled at the English occupation of 1806 and were not reestablished till 1820, instituted in the colony religious equality for all persons, irrespective of creed.\n\nJews did not arrive in any significant numbers at Cape Town before the 1820s. The first congregation in South Africa, known as the Gardens Shul, was founded in Cape Town in September 1841, and the initial service was held on the eve of Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement) in the house of 1820 Settler and businessman Benjamin Norden, located at the corner of Weltevreden and Hof streets. Benjamin Norden, Simeon Markus, together with a score of others arriving in the early 1820s and '30s, were commercial pioneers, especially the Mosenthal brothers—Julius, Adolph (see Aliwal North), and James Mosenthal—who started a major wool industry. By their enterprise in going to Asia and returning with thirty Angora goats in 1856 they became the originators of the mohair industry. Aaron and Daniel de Pass were the first to open up Namaqualand, and from 1849 to 1886 they were the largest shipowners in Cape Town, and leaders of the sealing, whaling, and fishing industries. Jews were among the first to take to ostrich-farming and played a role in the early diamond industry. Jews also played some part in early South African politics. Captain Joshua Norden was shot at the head of his Mounted Burghers in the Xhosa War of 1846; Lieutenant Elias de Pass fought in the Xhosa War of 1849. Julius Mosenthal (1818–1880), brother of the poet S. Mosenthal of Vienna, was a member of the Cape Parliament in the 1850s. Simeon Jacobs, C.M.G. (1832–1883), who was a judge in the Supreme Court of the Cape of Good Hope, as the acting attorney-general of Cape Colony he introduced and carried in 1872 the Cape Colony Responsible Government Bill and the Voluntary Bill (abolishing state aid to the Anglican Church), for both of which bills Saul Solomon, the member for Cape Town, had fought for decades.

St. Helena 25 May 1817; d. 16 October 1892), the leader of the Cape Colony Liberal Party, has been called the \"Cape Disraeli.\" He was invited into the first Responsible government, formed by Sir John Molteno, and declined the premiership itself several times. Like Disraeli, too, he early left the ranks of Judaism.\nAt the same time, the Jews faced substantial antisemitism. Though freedom of worship was granted to all residents in 1870, the revised \"Grondwet\" of 1894 still debarred Jews and Catholics from military posts, from the positions of president, state secretary, or magistrate, from membership in the First and Second \"Volksraad\" (\"parliament\"), and from superintendencies of natives and mines. These positions were restricted to persons above 30 years of age with permanent property and a longer history of settlement. As a consequence of the fact that Boer republics were only in existence from 1857 to 1902, unfortunately many residents of the Boer republics had limited access to positions in the upper echelons of government. All instruction was to be given in a Christian and Protestant spirit, and Jewish and Catholic teachers and children were to be excluded from state-subsidized schools. Before the Boer War (1899–1902), Jews were often considered \"uitlanders\" (\"foreigners\") and excluded from the mainstream of South African life.\n\nHowever, a small number of Jews also settled among and identified with the rural white Afrikaans-speaking population; these persons became known as \"Boerejode\" (Boer Jews). A measure of intermarriage also occurred and was generally accepted.\n\nThe South African gold rush began after 1886, attracting many Jews. In 1880, the Jewish population of South Africa numbered approximately 4,000; by 1914 it had grown to more than 40,000. So many of them came from Lithuania that some referred to the population as a colony of Lithuania; Johannesburg was also occasionally called \"Jewburg\".\n\nJews fought on both sides during the Second Boer War (1899–1902). Some of the most notable fights during the three years' Boer War — such as the Gun Hill incident before the Siege of Ladysmith — involved Jewish soldiers like Major Karri Davies. Nearly 2,800 Jews fought on the British side and the London \"Spectator\" counted that 125 were killed. (Jewish Encyclopedia)\n\nAround 300 Jews served among the Boers during the Second Boer War and were known as \"Boerjode\": those who had citizenship rights were conscripted along with other \"burghers\" (\"citizens\"), but there were also a number of volunteers. Jews fought under the Boers' \"Vierkleur\" (\"four coloured\") flag in many of the major battles and engagements and during the guerilla phase of the war, and a dozen are known to have died. Around 80 were captured and held in British concentration camps in South Africa. Some were sent as far afield as St. Helena, Bermuda, and Ceylon to where they had been exiled by the British. Some Jews were among the \"Bittereinders\" (\"Bitter Enders\") who fought on long after the Boer cause was clearly lost.\n\nAlthough the Jews were allowed equal rights after the Boer War, they again became subject to persecution in the days leading up to World War II. In 1930, the \"Quota Act\" of 1930 was intended to curtail the entry of Jews into South Africa. The vast majority of Jews immigrating to South Africa came from diaspora communities in Lithuania. The 1937 \"The Aliens Act\", motivated by a sharp increase the previous year in the number of German Jewish refugees coming to South Africa, brought the migration to almost a complete halt. Some Jews were able to enter the country, but many were unable to do so. A total of approximately six-and-a-half thousand Jews came to South Africa from Germany between the years 1933 and 1939. Many Afrikaners (i.e., Boers) felt sympathy for Nazi Germany, and organizations like Louis Weichardt’s \"Grayshirts\" and the pro-Nazi Ossewabrandwag were openly anti-Semitic. During World War I, many Afrikaners, who had little respect for Britain, objected to the use of \"Afrikaner women and children from the British concentration camps\" in fighting the German territory of South West Africa on behalf of Britain. This had the effect of drumming up pro-German sentiment among a population of Afrikaners. The opposition National Party argued that the Aliens Act was too lenient and advocated a complete ban on Jewish immigration, a halt in the naturalization of Jewish permanent residents of South Africa and the banning of Jews from certain professions. After the war, the situation began to improve, and a large number of South African Jews, generally a fairly Zionist community, made aliyah to Israel. While it is understandable that many South African Jews would feel uncomfortable with formerly pro-Nazi Afrikaners rising to power in 1948, many leading apartheid-era Afrikaner politicians publicly apologized to the South African Jewish community for their earlier anti-semitic actions and assured it of its continued safety in South Africa.\n\nDuring this time, there were also two waves of Jewish immigration to Africa from the island of Rhodes, first in the 1900s and then after 1960.\n\nWhen the Afrikaner-dominated National Party came to power in 1948 it did not adopt an anti-Jewish policy despite its earlier position. In 1953 South Africa's Prime Minister, D. F. Malan, became the first foreign head of government to visit Israel though the trip was a \"private visit\" rather than an official state visit. This began a long history of cooperation between Israel and South Africa on many levels. The proudly Zionistic South African Jewish community, through such bodies as the South African Zionist Federation and a number of publications, maintained a cordial relationship with the South African government even though it objected to the policies of Apartheid being enacted. South Africa's Jews were permitted to collect huge sums of money to be sent on as official aid to Israel, in spite of strict exchange-control regulations. Per capita, South African Jews were reputedly the most financially supportive Zionists abroad.\n\nA number of South African Jews settled in Israel, forming a South African community in Israel. Perhaps the most famous South African community founded in Israel is Savyon, which remains the wealthiest suburb in Israel. Large houses were built in the style that the community was accustomed to from their life in South Africa, each with a pool, and developed around a country club.\n\nMost African states broke ties after the 1973 Yom Kippur War, and Israel began to view the similarly isolated South Africa cordially. Ethan A. Nadelmann claimed that the relationship developed due to the fact that many African countries broke diplomatic ties with Israel during the 1970s following the Six-Day War and Yom Kippur War, causing Israel to deepen relations with other isolated countries.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, Israel's relations with South Africa were warm. In 1975, the Israel–South Africa Agreement was signed, and increasing economic cooperation between Israel and South Africa was reported, including the construction of a major new railway in Israel, and the building of a desalination plant in South Africa. In April 1976 South African Prime Minister John Vorster was invited to make a state visit, meeting Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Later in 1976, the 5th Conference of Non-Aligned Nations in Colombo, Sri Lanka, adopted a resolution calling for an oil embargo against France and Israel because of their arms sales to South Africa. In 1977, South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha visited Israel to discuss South African issues with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan.\n\nBenjamin Beit-Hallahmi, a controversial Israeli professor of psychology, wrote in 1988 that the alliance between South Africa and Israel was one of the most underreported news stories of the past four decades and that Israel played a crucial role in the survival of the South African regime. Israel's collaboration with Apartheid South Africa was mentioned and condemned by various international organizations like the UN General Assembly (several times since 1974). In 1987 Israel announced that it would be implementing sanctions against South Africa. By the beginning of the 1990s, military and economic ties between the two countries had been lost.\n\nSouth African Jews have a history of political moderation and the majority supported opposition parties such as first the United Party, then the Liberal Party, Progressive Party and its successors during the decades of National Party apartheid rule. (See Liberalism in South Africa). The prime example of the more moderate approach is that of the highly assimilated Harry Oppenheimer (1908–2000) (born Jewish but converted to Anglicanism upon his marriage), the richest man in South Africa and the chairman of the De Beers and Anglo American corporations. He was a supporter of the liberal Progressive Party and its policies, believing that granting more freedom and economic growth to South Africa's Black African majority was good politics and sound economic policy. The banner for this cause was held high by Helen Suzman, as the lone Progressive Party member in South Africa's parliament, representing the voting district of Houghton, home to many wealthy Jewish families at the time. The Progressive Party (later renamed the Democratic Party and then the Democratic Alliance) was later led by Jewish politician, Tony Leon and his successor, Helen Zille. Zille is of Jewish descent, her parents separately left Germany in the 1930s to avoid Nazi persecution (her maternal grandfather and paternal grandmother were Jewish).\n\nIn 1980, after 77 years of neutrality, South Africa's National Congress of the Jewish Board of Deputies passed a resolution urging \"all concerned [people] and, in particular, members of our community to cooperate in securing the immediate amelioration and ultimate removal of all unjust discriminatory laws and practices based on race, creed, or colour\". This inspired some Jews to intensify their anti-apartheid activism, but the bulk of the community either emigrated or avoided public conflict with the National Party government.\n\nThe Jewish establishment and the majority of South African Jews remained focused on Jewish issues. A few rabbis spoke out against apartheid early, but they failed to gain support and it was not until 1985 that the rabbinate as a whole condemned apartheid (Adler 2000). The South African Union for Progressive Judaism (SAUPJ) took the strongest stand of any of the Jewish movements in the country against apartheid. It opposed disinvestment while women in the movement engaged in social work as a form of protest. This includes the Moses Weiler School in Alexandra where for generations the school has been funded and led by women from the Progressive movement, even in opposition to the Bantu Education Act, 1953 (Feld 2014).\n\nAlthough the Jewish community peaked in the 1970s (at around 120,000), about 70,000 mostly nominally Orthodox, remain in South Africa. A proportion are secular, or have converted to Christianity. Despite low intermarriage rates (around 7%), approximately 1,800 Jews emigrate every year, mainly to Israel, Australia, Canada and the United States. The Jewish community in South Africa is currently the largest in Africa, and, although shrinking due to emigration, it remains one of the most nominally Orthodox communities in the world, although there is a significantly growing Progressive community, especially in Cape Town. The nation's Progressive communities are represented by the South African Union for Progressive Judaism (SAUPJ). The current Orthodox Chief Rabbi, Warren Goldstein (2008), has been widely credited for initiating a \"Bill of Responsibilities\" which the government has incorporated in the national school curriculum. The Chief Rabbi has also pushed for community run projects to combat crime in the country. \n\nThe community has become more observant and in Johannesburg, the largest centre of Jewish life with 66,000 Jews, there is a high number and density of kosher restaurants and religious centres. In politics, the Jewish community continues to have influence, particularly in leadership roles. Currently, the sole national Jewish newspaper, with a readership of about 40,000, is the \"South African Jewish Report\". In 2008, a Jewish radio station, ChaiFM, commenced broadcasting in Johannesburg, and also broadcasting on the internet to the large South African \"diaspora\". Despite a fall in number, since 2003 the number of South African Jews has stabilised.\n\nThe 2016 Community Survey mini-census conducted by Statistics South Africa found the largest numbers in the following municipalities:\nJohannesburg 23,420; Cape Town 12,672; Ethekwini (Durban) 3,599; Ekurhuleni (East Rand) 1,846; Tshwane (Pretoria) 1,579; Nelson Mandela Bay (Port Elizabeth) 623; Msunduzi (Pietermaritzburg) 600; Mangaung (Bloemfontein) 343; Stellenbosch 316; Buffalo City (East London) 251; Mbombela (Nelspruit) 242.\n\nThe \"Lemba\" or \"wa-Remba\" are a southern African ethnic group whose members are to be found in Zimbabwe and South Africa with some little known branches in Mozambique and Malawi. According to Tudor Parfitt they are thought to number 70,000. They speak the Bantu languages spoken by their geographic neighbours and resemble them physically, but they have some religious practices and beliefs similar to those in Judaism and Islam, which they claim were transmitted by oral tradition. They have a tradition of ancient Jewish or South Arabian descent through their male line. Genetic Y-DNA analyses in the 2000s have established a partially Middle-Eastern origin for a portion of the male Lemba population. More recent research argues that DNA studies do not support claims for a specifically Jewish genetic heritage.\n\nTraditionally, Jewish education in South Africa was conducted by the Cheder or Talmud Torah, while children received secular education at government and private schools. There were, initially, no formal structures in place for Rabbinical education. (Note that although the majority of South Africa's Jews are descendants of Lithuanian Jews who venerated Talmudic scholarship, the community did not establish schools or yeshivot for several decades.)\n\nAn important change took place in 1948, when King David School was established as the first full-time dual-curriculum (secular and Jewish) Jewish day school – the high school was established in 1955. Today, the King David schools are amongst the largest Jewish day schools in the world, with thousands of students. King David's equivalent in Cape Town is \"Herzlia\" (United Herzlia Schools) with Carmel School in Pretoria and Durban (both subsequently renamed), and the Theodore Herzl School in Port Elizabeth (est. 1959). Umhlanga Jewish Day School, was opened in January 2012, to cater for Jewish children in the greater Durban area. In total, nineteen Day Schools, affiliated to the South African Board of Jewish Education, have been established in the main centres. The Jewish day schools regularly place amongst the top in the country in the national Matric examinations\n\nThe first religious day school, the Yeshiva College of South Africa, was established in the mid-1950s, drawing primarily on the popularity of the Bnei Akiva Religious Zionist youth movement. As an institution with hundreds of pupils, Yeshivah College is today the largest religious school in the country. Other educational institutions within this ideology include Phyllis Jowell Jewish Day School and Cape Town Torah High in Cape Town, the Kollel (\"Bet Mordechai\") and Midrasha (\"Emunah\") of Mizrachi, Johannesburg, and the Yeshiva of Cape Town, a \"Torah MiTzion\" Kollel.\n\nIn parallel to the establishment of Yeshiva College, and drawing on the same momentum, several smaller yeshivot were opened, starting in the 1960s. The Yeshivah Gedolah of Johannesburg, established in 1973, is the best known of these, having trained dozens of South African Rabbis, including Chief Rabbi Dr. Warren Goldstein. The Yeshiva follows the \"Telshe\" educational model, although accommodates students from across the spectrum of \"Hashkafa\" (Hebrew: worldview, outlook, beliefs within orthodox Judaism).\n\nThis era also saw the start of a large network of Chabad-Lubavitch activities and institutions. There is today a Lubavitch Yeshiva in Johannesburg (Lubavitch Yeshiva Gedolah of Johannesburg) serving the Chabad community, a Chabad Semicha programme in Pretoria (having ordained 98 Rabbis since its establishment in 2001), and Lubavitch Day schools in Johannesburg (the Torah Academy school) and Cape Town. Johannesburg boasts ten Chabad Houses, Cape Town two and Kwazulu-Natal one, all of which offer a variety of Torah classes and adult education and informal children's education programmes.\n\nThe 1980s saw the establishment of a Haredi kollel, Yad Shaul, as well as the growth of a large baal teshuva (\"returnees\" [to observant Judaism]) movement – this was supported by the Israel-based organizations Ohr Somayach and Aish HaTorah which established active branches in South Africa; Arachim also has an active presence. Ohr Somayach, South Africa operates a full-time Yeshiva in Johannesburg (\"Yeshivas Meshech Chochma\") – with its Bet Midrash established in 1990, and its Kollel (\"Toras Chaim\") in 1996 – as well as a Midrasha (\"Ma'ayan Bina\"); it also runs a Bet Midrash in Cape Town. There are several Haredi boys' schools in Johannesburg, each associated with one of the yeshivot, as well as a Beis Yaakov girls' school.\n\nThe Progressive Movement maintains a network of supplementary Hebrew and Religious classes at its temples. These schools are all affiliated to the SA Union for Progressive Judaism. Rabbi Sa'ar Shaked, congregational rabbi of Beit Emanuel Progressive Synagogue is currently involved in efforts to establish a Rabbinic Academy and Higher Education Institution in Gauteng.\n\nConservative / Masorti's presence in South Africa is limited to one synagogue in Johannesburg.\n\nLimmud was introduced to the country in 2007. The Limmud South Africa conferences are held in August/September each year. South Africa's Orthodox rabbis do not participate, unlike the UK's Orthodox Rabbinate part of whom have taken part in Limmud UK; see Limmud: Relationships with Centrist Orthodoxy in Britain.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The term later became associated with Korean-derived cuisine during the early Shōwa period. Due to the Korean War, the terms associated with Korea in Japan were divided into North Korea (Kita Chōsen) and South Korea (Kankoku); the reference to a \"yakiniku restaurant\" arose as a politically correct term for restaurants of either origin.\n\nToday, \"yakiniku\" commonly refers to a style of cooking bite-size meat (usually beef and offal) and vegetables on gridirons or griddles over a flame of wood charcoals carbonized by dry distillation (\"sumibi\", 炭火) or a gas/electric grill. In many parts of the world, yakiniku is also commonly referred to as \"Japanese barbecue\". The origin of contemporary yakiniku has become a subject of debate, though it is conventionally considered to have been inspired by similar Korean cuisine. In 2002 the NHK program \"NHK Ningen Kōza\" (NHK人間講座, \"NHK Humanity Lecture\") stated that: \"While some tend to think that yakiniku came from Korea, it was born in post war Japan.\" Nonetheless, it remains categorically associated with similar Korean cuisine, with various dishes, such as bulgogi, being modified to better appeal to Japanese tastes.\n\nThe present style of yakiniku restaurants are derived from Korean restaurants in Osaka and Tokyo, which opened around 1945. In a yakiniku restaurant, diners order prepared raw ingredients (individually or as a set) which are brought to the table. The ingredients are cooked by the diners on a grill built into the table, several pieces at a time. The ingredients are then dipped in sauces known as \"tare\" before being eaten. The most common sauce is made of soy sauce mixed with sake, mirin, sugar, garlic, fruit juice and sesame. Garlic-and-shallot or miso-based dips are sometimes used. Korean side dishes like kimchi, nameul, bibimbap are served alongside.\n\nAfter officially being prohibited for many years, eating beef was legalised in 1871 following the Meiji Restoration as part of an effort to introduce western culture to the country. The Emperor Meiji became part of a campaign to promote beef consumption, publicly eating beef on January 24, 1873. \"Steak\" and \"roasted meat\" were translated as \"yakiniku\" (焼肉) and \"iriniku\" (焙肉), respectively, as proposed western-style menus in \"Seiyō Ryōri Shinan\" although this usage of the former word was eventually replaced by the loanword \"sutēki\".\n\n\"Jingisukan\", the Japanese transliteration of Genghis Khan, is a style of grilling mutton, which is also referred to as a type of yakiniku. The dish was conceived in Hokkaidō, where it has been a popular blue-collar dish that has only recently gained nationwide popularity. The name Jingisukan is thought to have been invented by Sapporo-born Tokuzo Komai, who was inspired by the grilled mutton dishes of Northeastern Chinese cuisine. The first written mention of the dish under this name was in 1931.\n\nCommon Japanese style of \"yakiniku\", drawing heavy influences from Korean dishes such as bulgogi and galbi, became widespread in Japan during the 20th century, most notably after the Second World War. Restaurants serving this dish either advertised themselves as \"horumonyaki\" (, offal-grill) or simply . The division of the Korean peninsula led to disagreements in the mid-1960s in the naming of \"Korean food\", with pro-South businesses changing their signs to \"\" (named after Republic of Korea) rather than retaining the term \"Chōsen\" (Joseon), the name of the old, undivided Korea which by then had been appropriated by the North.\nVentilated barbecue systems, introduced by Shinpo Co., Ltd. in March 1980, quickly spread throughout Japan as it enabled diners to eat yakiniku in a smoke-free environment and greatly extended the clientele.\n\nThe popularity of yakiniku was given a further boost in 1991 when the easing of beef import restrictions led to a drop in the price of beef. However, the industry was dealt an unprecedented blow in 2001 with the occurrence of BSE (mad cow disease) in Japan.\n\nTypical ingredients include:\n\nIn 1993, the All Japan Yakiniku Association proclaimed 29 August as official \"Yakiniku Day\" (\"yakiniku no hi\"), a form of goroawase (numerical wordplay), as the date 8月29 can be (roughly) read as ya-(tsu)ki-ni-ku (8 = ya, 2 = ni, 9 = ku).\n\n\n\n"}

After admission to the college, the ephebus took the oath of allegiance, recorded in histories by Pollux and Stobaeus (but not in Aristotle), in the temple of Aglaurus, and was sent to Munichia or Acte to form one of the garrison. At the end of the first year of training, the ephebi were reviewed, and, if their performance was satisfactory, were provided by the state with a spear and a shield, which, together with the (cloak) and (broad-brimmed hat), made up their equipment. In their second year they were transferred to other garrisons in Attica, patrolled the frontiers, and on occasion took an active part in war. During these two years they were free from taxation, and were generally not allowed to appear in the law courts as plaintiffs or defendants. The ephebi took part in some of the most important Athenian festivals. Thus during the Eleusinian Mysteries they were sent to fetch the sacred objects from Eleusis and to escort the image of Iacchus on the sacred way. They also performed police duty at the meetings of the ecclesia.\n\nAfter the end of the 4th century BC, the institution underwent a radical change. Enrolment ceased to be obligatory, lasted only for a year, and the limit of age was dispensed with. Inscriptions attest a continually decreasing number of ephebi, and with the admission of foreigners the college lost its representative national character. This was mainly due to the weakening of the military spirit and the progress of intellectual culture. The military element was no longer all-important, and the ephebia became a sort of university for well-to-do young men of good family, whose social position has been compared with that of the Athenian \"knights\" of earlier times. The institution lasted till the end of the 3rd century A.D.\n\nIn regards to Greek mythology, the ephebe was a young man or initiate, around the ages of 17 to 20, who was put through a period of isolation from his prior community, usually the world of his mother, where he was a child in the community. The ephebe would need to hunt, rely on his senses, on aggression, stealth, and trickery to survive. At the end of the initiation, the ephebe was reincorporated back into society as a man. The idea was that if the community was ever threatened, its men would have these skills needed to protect it.\n\nIn Rome, where the elite (mainly patricians) were often sent to Greece or received Greek teachers, the Greek word was adopted in the Latinate form \"ephebus\" (plural \"ephebi\"), and fixed at the 16 to 20 age bracket. Several new officials were introduced, one of special importance being the director of the Diogeneion, where youths under age were trained for the ephebia. At this period the college of ephebi was a miniature city; its members called themselves \"citizens\", and it possessed an archon (ruler), strategos, herald and other officials, after the model of ancient Athens.\n\nIn Ancient Greek sculpture, an ephebe is a sculptural type depicting a nude \"ephebos\" (Archaic examples of the type are also often known as the kouros type, or kouroi in the plural). This typological name often occurs in the form \"the \" Ephebe\"\", where is the collection to which the object belongs or belonged, or the site on which it was found (e.g. the \"Agrigento Ephebe\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The commission operated under a two-year mandate, from 1997 to 1999, and employed three commissioners: one Guatemalan man, one male non-national, and one Mayan woman. The mandate of the commission was not to judge but to clarify the past with \"objectivity, equity and impartiality.\"\n\nAmong other things, the commission revealed that over 200,000 people were killed or disappeared during the conflict and attributed 93% of the violations to state forces and related paramilitary groups. The commission noted that during the conflict the distinction between combatant and non-combatant was not respected and as a result many children, priests, indigenous leaders, and innocent women and men were killed. The CEH aimed to instill national harmony, promote peace, foster a culture of mutual respect regarding human rights, and preserve the memory of the conflict's victims.\n\nGuatemala is a multiethnic, pluricultural and multilingual nation and has been plagued by violence and exclusion directed at the poorest and most vulnerable, specifically the indigenous (Mayan) communities. A colonial legacy left power in the hands of an elite minority, much like many other Latin American countries. Repression was omnipresent — specifically with regards to insurgent groups.\n\nIn 1954 Guatemala's democratically elected President Jacobo Árbenz was overthrown by a U.S.backed right-wing military dictator, Carlos Castillo Armas, in a military coup d'état. The 36 year Guatemalan civil war began in the early 1960s with a military rebellion by left-wing insurgency groups against the new regime. In response, the Guatemalan government employed counter-insurgency tactics, and state-based violence and terror began to escalate. The conflict intensified in the 1970s and saw the height of its destruction and casualties in the 1979 - 1984 period. Guatemala's civil war concluded with the 1996 Oslo Agreement which declared a formal ceasefire between the Guatemalan government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca, URNG) forces.\n\nThere is a plethora of root causes of Guatemala's 36 year civil war. Guatemala's economy, heavily based on coffee and sugar exports, relied on the exploitation of indigenous labour and land. A democratic regime and Marxist insurgencies posed a direct threat to the political and economic elite as well as their main trading partner — the United States. As a result, the state magnified the military threat posed by the insurgency and launched attacks that lead to civilian massacres and violations of human rights of any suspected \"supporters\" of the guerrilla. In addition, under a Cold War context, anti-communist sentiment permeated the U.S. - Guatemalan discourse and thus counterinsurgency against the Marxist insurgency groups was more severe.\n\nIn June 1994 the Guatemalan government and the URNG, under advisory by the UN Secretary General and the United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA), signed the \"Agreement on the establishment of the Commission to clarify past human rights violations and acts of violence that have caused the Guatemalan population to suffer,\" which led to the creation of the CEH. Aside from pressure from the UN Secretary General to work towards truth and reconciliation, the road to the CEH was influenced by the Catholic Church — specifically when it created the Human Rights Office of the Archdiocese of Guatemala (ODHA) in the mid 1990s.\n\nWith a belief that uncovering the truth would make national reconciliation a possibility and authentic democracy a reality, the CEH aimed not to judge but to clarify the past with \"objectivity, equity and impartiality.\" The commission aimed to ask and answer questions such as: \nInstillation of national harmony, promotion of peace, the creation of a culture of mutual respect regarding human rights and the preservation of the memory of the victims was of paramount importance to the commission. Guatemalans and external actors in favour of the commission's work wanted to record Guatemala's bloody past. There is awareness with regards to the systematic violation of human rights during the civil war, but the acts committed and their consequences have yet to become entrenched in the national consciousness and historical memory of Guatemalans.\n\nThe commission's duration lasted two years, from February 1997 to February 1999. Its three commissioners were:\nThe process of the commission was complex and was by no means solely a national effort. Throughout the two year mandate of the commission, multiple countries — including Austria, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom — provided monetary, political and moral support. The U.S. provided declassified documents crucial to the commission, and the UN Secretary General promoted the project and facilitated the contribution of monetary resources and expert knowledge through various UN bodies.\n\nThe commission, as outlined in its charter, was to be composed of the current moderator of the peace negotiations (appointed by the UN Secretary General), one Guatemalan citizen (appointed by the aforementioned moderator and agreed upon by both parties), and one academic (selected by the monitor from a list comprised by Guatemalan university presidents and approved by both parties). At the height of the investigations, the commission had a staff of 269 and 14 field offices. The staff consisted of both national, and international commissioners — who accounted for just under half of employees. By the end of the CEH's duration, 2000 communities had been visited and testimonies were received from approximately 20,000 people.\n\nThe restrictions of the Commission were as follows: responsibility could not be attributed to any individual — naming names was not allowed; the findings and conclusions of the CEH could not have judicial repercussions; and the commission would have a six-month mandate — extendable to 18 months. The final restriction was not upheld as the commission duration lasted two years. In addition, the CEH had no subpoena powers.\n\nThe CEH's report, Memory of Silence (Memoria del Silencio) was presented in February 1999 in a 12 volume report to representatives of the URNG and the Guatemalan government as well as Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary General. The report is available online for public access in both English and Spanish.\n\nFor the CEH it was clear that in order to understand the past and move forward on a trajectory for peace, an in-depth analysis of the causes of the civil war was required. They concluded that the four main causes of the conflict were as follows: Structural injustice, closing of free, public spaces, anti-democracy trajectory, Cold War context and international influence.\n\nThe CEH also investigated Guatemala's systemic problems. They concluded that the structure and nature of economic, cultural and social relations in Guatemala are marked by profound exclusion, antagonism and conflict — a reflection of its colonial history. In addition, they found the absence of effective state social policy to have accentuated the historical dynamic of exclusion. In fact, they state, most recent state policy has produced inequality and endemic institutional weakness perpetuates the discrepancies among demographics. Leading up to the conflict, civil and political rights were suppressed and public venues were closed to prevent the spread of anti-government sentiment and other revolutionary thinking. During the armed conflict, the incapacity of the state to deal with political instability led to the creation of an intricate system of repression including an underground, illegal punitive system. Military intelligence was the conflict's driving force. Impunity permeated Guatemala's political system.\n\nThe principal focus on the CEH was with regards to human rights violations during the civil war. They registered a total of 42,275 casualties by human rights violations and acts of violence, of that 23,671 were victims of arbitrary execution and 6,159 by forced disappearance. Estimates of those killed or disappeared during the conflict reach as high as 200,000. In terms of demographics, the CEH found that 83% of \"fully identified\" victims were Mayan and 17% Ladino. 93% of the violations were attributed to state forces and related paramilitary groups and 3% to insurgency groups. Among the victims of arbitrary execution, forced disappearance, torture, rape and other violations of fundamental rights were children, priests, indigenous leaders as well as non-combatant women and men with no ties to insurgency groups.\n\nThe CEH highlighted seven main recommendations for Guatemala's government as it embarked upon a path of peace and reconciliation. These recommendations were created in accordance with the UN draft \"Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparations for Victims of Violation of International Human Rights and Humanitarian Law\" (E/CN.4/Sub2/1996/17). \nThroughout the recommendations the CEH highlights the need for indigenous political participation.\n\nThe Guatemalan army was opposed to many human rights aspects of the 1996 Peace Accords including the creation and work of the CEH. They argued that these tools were to be used by the insurgency groups to garner political support and military strength. However, support for human rights focused accords and commissions were strongly supported by the URNG, the Catholic Church, and various civil society and human rights based groups. Problems the commission faced were primarily based on political and ideological disagreements. In fact, although the CEH finally came to fruition, its progress was stalled when the army stated its clear opposition to the commission and the URNG affirmed its inclusion as non-negotiable.\n\nSince the report was released in 1999, progress has been made with regards to compliance of the aforementioned recommendations. In 2000 Guatemala ratified the Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearances, the Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights regarding social economic and cultural rights, and the Optional Protocol of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In 2002 it ratified the Optional Protocol of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, regarding the participation of children in armed conflicts and the recognition of the competence of the Committee Against Torture to receive individual complaints in 2003. Although these accords have been signed and ratified, their content has yet to be integrated into current and future domestic plans. In addition, in 2003, 20 years after the majority of human rights violations occurred, a National Reparations Program was established.\n\nIn accordance with the CEH's statement that the state was obligated to investigate crimes committed during the conflict, José Efraín Ríos Montt— former military dictator — was tried and convicted for genocide and crimes against humanity. However, for multiple reasons his trial was suspended until January 2015, then further suspended until January 2016. A closed-door trial began in March 2016. Rios Montt died while the trial was still ongoing.\n\nOne of the most controversial revelations of the commission was its statement that at no time during the conflict did guerrilla groups have the military potential to pose an immediate threat to the state or its army. The state was well aware that the insurgency did not represent a real threat to Guatemalan political order. It has been argued that they deliberately magnified the military threat of the insurgency to justify the crimes they committed.\n\nIn the several years following the release of the CEH's report, scholars have analysed its effectiveness in preventing conflict and creating national harmony as highlighted in the commission's mandate. Jeff Corntassel and Cindy Holder argue that state-facilitated truth mechanisms are fundamentally flawed if they do not address historic and ongoing injustices against indigenous groups — this is particularly relevant in Guatemala considering 83% of the victims in the conflict were indigenous. In addition, Rachel Sieder has investigated judicial reform and violence in postwar Guatemala and states that homicide rates in fact were higher in 2011 than during the height of the armed conflict. The effectiveness of the CEH is highly contested, however it has seen successes — particularly with the opening of spaces like 'La casa de la memoria' which exist to preserve the memory of the conflict's victims.\n\n\n"}

This dark blue to purple solid is a salt of the metal complex [Cu(NH)(HO)]. It is closely related to Schweizer's reagent, which is used for the production of cellulose fibers in the production of rayon. It is used to print fabrics, used as a pesticide and to make other copper compounds like copper nano-powder.\n\nThis compound can be prepared by adding concentrated solution of ammonia to a saturated aqueous solution of copper sulfate pentahydrate followed by precipitation of the product with ethanol.\n\nThe deep blue crystalline solid tends to hydrolyse and evolve (release) ammonia upon standing in air. It is fairly soluble in water. The brilliant dark blue-violet color of tetraamminecopper(II) sulfate solution is due to presence of [Cu(NH)]. Often, the dark blue-violet color is used as a positive test to verify the presence of Cu in a solution.\n\nThe solid state salt of tetraamminecopper(II) sulfate contains the complex ion [Cu(NH)HO], which has a square pyramidal molecular geometry. The bond length between the atoms in the crystal are measured using X-ray crystallography; the Cu-N and Cu-O distances are about 210 and 233 pm, respectively. Cu(NH)The correct concentrations of ammonia and copper sulfate solution needed to synthesize the complex can be determined by colorimetry. The combination of the correct concentrations will produce the highest absorbance read out on the colorimeter and as a result the formula of the complex can be verified.\n\nThe characteristic deep blue colour of the tetraammine complex is found in brass and copper alloys where attack from ammonia has occurred, leading to cracking. The problem was first found in ammunition cartridge cases when they were stored near animal waste, which produced trace amounts of ammonia. This type of corrosion is known as season cracking.\n\nAs already mentioned the closely related Schweizer's reagent is used for the production of cuprammonium rayon.\n\nMost pesticides contain ammonium sulfate. Ammonium sulfate is used as an agricultural spray adjuvant for water-soluble insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides. There, it functions to bind iron and calcium cations that are present in both well water and plant cells. It is particularly effective as an adjuvant for 2, 4-D (amine), glyphosate, and glufosinate herbicides. The brilliant dark blue-violet color and a good solubility make tetraammine copper (II) sulfate an excellent chemical to dye fabrics. Some of the recent research and development for copper include various studies of tetraaminecopper (II) sulfate. One such research is \"Chemical reduction method for preparing copper nano-powder with high purity using sodium hypophosphite as reductant\", which uses tetraaminecopper (II) sulfate.\n\nThe magnetic and thermal properties of tetraammine copper (II) sulfate monohydrate have been extensively studied and have been interpreted as those of a substance containing a magnetic linear chain structure. In 1967, Saito & Kanda conducted proton nuclear magnetic resonance studies on this material in the paramagnetic and ordered state. Unfortunately, the lack of proton positions prevented a quantitative interpretation of these data. Since the early crystallographic study by Mazzi (1955) reported a structure based on projected data and indicated an unusual coordination about the copper ion, a detail structure determination was considered necessary for any future quantitative interpretation of the observed resonance data.\n\n"}

{"id": "2178541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2178541", "title": "Highway revolt", "text": "Highway revolt\n\nMany highway revolts (also freeway revolts, expressway revolts, or road protests) took place in developed countries during the 1960s and 1970s, in response to plans for the construction of new freeways, as advocated for by the highway lobby. A significant number of these highways were abandoned or significantly scaled back due to widespread public opposition, especially of those whose neighborhoods would be disrupted or displaced by the proposed freeways, and due to various other negative effects that freeways are considered to have.\n\nWhile anti-freeway activism in Australia has not been as vocal as in North America, small-scale revolts against freeway construction have occurred in Sydney and Melbourne, with many protesting toll collection.\n\nMelbourne saw protests against the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan, mostly by those in the impacted inner-city areas.\n\nIn 1974, 150 residents protesting plans for the F-19 freeway through Collingwood put themselves in front of construction equipment in an attempt to halt construction. In 1978, protesters rallied to defend Gardiners Creek in Kooyong, which was in the path of the South Eastern Freeway. In 1984, over 100 protesters rallied against the widening of Punt Road to become the Hoddle Highway.\n\nMany of the unbuilt freeways were eventually cancelled by change of government, but some projects were later resurrected. An umbrella organisation known as the Coalition Against Freeway Expansion (CAFE) was formed in 1994, and in the following year, 14 of its activists were arrested whilst protesting an Eastern Freeway extension and the partial demolition of Alexandra Parade. The aggressive police response was criticised, and led to the eventual disbandment of the group. One of the largest protests occurred in 2008 in Kensington, one of the areas most impacted by the proposed East-West road connection; it drew wider support due to opposition to the Eddington Transport Report.\n\nSydney freeway protests have included large-scale green bans in the 1970s, which prevented freeway proposals that would have required the demolition of The Rocks historic precinct and The Domain gardens for freeway developments.\n\nIn 1989, 200 protesters rallied against a proposed north-west tollway. In 1991, 150 anti-freeway protesters rallied outside Parliament House. In 1995, over 400 people protested the M2 Hills Motorway.\n\nTasmanian Aboriginals have conducted protests against the construction of the Brighton Bypass. They have stated that construction of the bypass will suffer the loss of their heritage.\n\nIn Halifax, Nova Scotia the construction of an elevated waterfront freeway, Harbour Drive, was halted in the 1970s after local opposition to the proposed destruction of many historic buildings. All that remains of the project today is the Cogswell Interchange, a massive concrete structure widely considered a barrier between sections of the city. Its demolition is currently planned.\n\nSeveral areas were destroyed to make room for highways in the 1960s and 1970s. At that time, a historical preservation movement involving figures such as Sandy van Ginkel and Phyllis Lambert prevented a project to run the Ville-Marie Expressway along the waterfront of the Old Port, which would have demolished much of the then-unloved Old Montreal and cut the city off from the river. Many historic homes were demolished to make way for the western section of the autoroute, but the eastern section was reconceived as a tunnel skirting the southern edge of the downtown core and a sunken expressway along the inland edge of the old city. Since then, Old Montreal has undergone significant rehabilitation and is now a desirable residential and commercial district and the city's leading tourist area. Part of the sunken expressway has been covered over (see Quartier international de Montréal) and the section immediately north of Montreal City Hall is also slated to be covered.\n\nAnother cancelled project would have seen Rue Berri converted into a north-south expressway, demolishing much of the Plateau Mont-Royal district. Only the portion south of Rue Cherrier was built.\n\nIn recent years, protests took place regarding a proposal to extend the Ville-Marie in the axis of Rue Notre-Dame Est, as an 8-lane entrenched highway that would separate the residential neighborhood of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve from the St. Lawrence River. The current plan is to widen the current 4-lane road into a six-lane \"urban boulevard\" rather than converting it into a full-scale expressway.\n\nSome large road projects from the heyday of the automobile have since been removed at public demand. One of the most prominent was a large interchange at the corner of Avenue du Parc and Avenue des Pins, which had long impeded pedestrian access along a major entryway into Mount Royal Park. The elevated structure was demolished in the early 2000s and replaced with a simpler, at-grade intersection. Another project nearing completion replaces the Bonaventure Expressway with an urban boulevard in the Griffintown neighborhood.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Toronto experienced the same sort of urban sprawl that was sweeping through the United States. Suburbs grew along existing highway corridors, stretching the city east and west, and then northward along the various provincial superhighways. These highways ended at the city limits, however, and there was little route capacity within the city itself. This caused enormous traffic problems within the city, and a network of new highways to address the problem became part of the Official Plan in 1959.\n\nAs construction of the network started, the mood of the citizens changed. By the mid-1960s, there was a growing awareness that the growth of the suburbs led to a flight of capital from the city cores, resulting in the urban decay being seen throughout the US. Additionally, several of the chosen routes ran through densely settled neighbourhoods, including some of the more upscale areas of Toronto, like Forest Hill and the University of Toronto. While the opposition was growing, Jane Jacobs moved to Toronto after having successfully rallied groups to cancel the construction of the Lower Manhattan Expressway in New York City. Applying the same formula in Toronto, Jacobs rallied local groups to oppose development of the Spadina Expressway project, while twice being arrested in the process.\n\nOn June 3, 1971, Premier Bill Davis rose in the Provincial Legislature and stated, \"Cities were built for people and not cars. If we are building a transportation system to serve the automobile, the Spadina Expressway would be a good place to start. But if we are building a transportation system to serve people, the Spadina Expressway is a good place to stop.\" The expressway plan was dead; construction of the Spadina Expressway ended. The successful outcome of inspired protests of varying degrees to other expressway projects in Toronto including the Scarborough, Richview, Crosstown and East Metro Expressway Projects. This led to none of the other planned expressways ever being built.\n\nInstead of expressways, Davis and his new Minister of Transport, Charles MacNaughton, outlined the \"GO-Urban\" plan, an Intermediate Capacity Transit System that will serve the Greater Toronto Area in place of expressways. This led to the development of Bombardier Innovia Metro. By the time the prototype was ready for service in the early 1980s, changes in the provincial government ended support for the entire GO-Urban project. Only a single short demonstration line was built in Toronto, the Scarborough RT.\n\nWindsor, Ontario is an interesting case of freeway revolt that was later partially reversed. By 1965, the MTO had completed construction of Highway 401 from the south end of Windsor to the Thousand Islands Parkway and onward to the Quebec border. Plans were announced to extend the freeway along Huron Church Road to the Ambassador Bridge, but residents and business owners along the route protested and killed the plan, leaving the freeway's terminus at Highway 3. In recent years, traffic had increased. A new bridge and freeway was needed; expropriation of nearby properties began in the late 2000s for Highway 401's extension to a new proposed border crossing. The Rt. Hon. Herb Gray Parkway's construction, much of it below-grade, began in late 2011 and is expected to be completed by 2015. , the proposed Gordie Howe International Bridge which will continue Ontario 401 through the Delray neighborhood of Detroit, Michigan to I-75 is expected to be completed by 2023.\n\nOriginal plans called for Alberta Highway 2 to continue into Edmonton, akin to the Deerfoot in Calgary, using 91st Street then descending into the Mill Creek Ravine. However residents along Mill Creek as well as many others who did not wish to have portions of the river valley destroyed at the expense of a freeway opposed the plans and as such they were never completed. The only portions to be completed were 91st Street and the James MacDonald Bridge.\n\nIn Vancouver, a freeway project that began with the construction of the Georgia and Dunsmuir Viaducts in the Strathcona neighborhood was stopped by activists and residents; the plan was intended to link an eight-lane freeway from the Trans-Canada Highway through the East End, destroying much of Chinatown. Before it was stopped, Vancouver's Hogan's Alley neighbourhood was largely demolished. The complete proposal in reports prepared by Swan-Wooster included a six lane tunnel to North Vancouver. An elevated freeway would have run along the Burrard Inlet waterfront, right through property where two Fairmont hotels and many other buildings have since been built. Another elevated freeway would have run through what is now the new portion of Yaletown, where the roundhouse is. It would likely have been adjacent to or above the current Pacific Avenue, between Old and New Yaletown.\n\nThe Dunsmuir tunnel, a former freight railroad line of the CPR would also have been part of the freeway. This tunnel is now used by the SkyTrain Expo Line, a rapid transit line using the Bombardier Innovia Metro technology developed for Toronto.\n\nAn attempt was made in 1995 to revive part of the project, adding three lanes of traffic to the north shore; it was also killed by public protest.\n\nSuccessive city councils in the 1970s and 1980s prohibited the construction of freeways as part of a long-term plan.\nThis was taken as far as refusing to have a cloverleaf where the provincially authorized and funded Oak Street Bridge entered the city. It was allowed to enter directly onto Oak Street, but no other approaches were allowed for decades. As a result, the only freeway within city limits is the Trans-Canada Highway, which passes through the north-eastern corner of the city. Very few major roads have been built in decades although the population would likely have doubled.\n\nThe conflicting opinions of the City of Vancouver's residents, as represented by their successive councils, and the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation continue in 2013. Many of the suburbs also want more automobile access to Vancouver. The city resists additional cars entering from the suburbs. The province continues to build bridges and freeways throughout the region, but they end at the city's boundaries.\n\nIn Amsterdam in the 1970s, plans existed for a highway between the end of the A2 at the President Kennedylaan to the IJtunnel, along with the plans of the Amsterdam Metro around Nieuwmarkt. It would have demolished thousands of houses and monuments on its path, and therefore it led to the Nieuwmarkt riots in 1975. The metro was built, but the highway plans were removed.\n\nIn Utrecht, plans to build the A27 led to years of protests and juridical procedures, for example in October 1978, there was a big demonstration. Eventually in 1982, the Dutch Parliament had to decide whether to build or not. A narrow majority of 71 was in favour, 69 opposed. Parts of Amelisweerd were occupied by activists after the decision. The encampment, established by the activists, was evacuated by police and 465 trees were cut down and bulldozed. At the same time a procedure opposing the tree felling was started, however, a municipality lawyer reported that the last tree had already been cut down. Thus the short-term procedure failed to achieve its aim. After the motorway was completed in 1986, more congestion arose on the motorway. In 2009, new plans were made to extend the road from 2x4 lanes to 2x6 or even 2x7. The start of the construction in 2011 led again to protests, with clearly visible banners along the motorway.\n\nIn the United States the \"revolts\" occurred mainly in cities and suburbs. Many cities have unused highways, abruptly terminating freeway alignments, and short stretches of freeway in remote areas, all evidence of larger projects which were never completed. In some instances, freeway revolts have led to the eventual removal or relocation of freeways that had been built.\n\n"}

Most cosmic dust particles measure between a few molecules and 0.1 µm. Cosmic dust can be further distinguished by its astronomical location: intergalactic dust, interstellar dust, interplanetary dust (such as in the zodiacal cloud) and circumplanetary dust (such as in a planetary ring).\n\nIn the Solar System, interplanetary dust causes the zodiacal light. Solar System dust includes comet dust, asteroidal dust, dust from the Kuiper belt, and interstellar dust passing through the Solar System. Thousands of tons of cosmic dust are estimated to reach the Earth's surface every year, with most grains having a mass between 10 kg (0.1 pg) and 10 kg (100 mg). The density of the dust cloud through which the Earth is traveling is approximately 10 dust grains/m.\n\nCosmic dust contains some complex organic compounds (amorphous organic solids with a mixed aromatic–aliphatic structure) that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by stars. A smaller fraction of dust in space is \"stardust\" consisting of larger refractory minerals that condensed as matter left by stars.\n\nInterstellar dust particles were collected by the \"Stardust\" spacecraft and samples were returned to Earth in 2006.\n\nCosmic dust was once solely an annoyance to astronomers, as it obscures objects they wish to observe. When infrared astronomy began, the dust particles were observed to be significant and vital components of astrophysical processes. Their analysis can reveal information about phenomena like the formation of the Solar System. For example, cosmic dust can drive the mass loss when a star is nearing the end of its life, play a part in the early stages of star formation, and form planets. In the Solar System, dust plays a major role in the zodiacal light, Saturn's B Ring spokes, the outer diffuse planetary rings at Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, and comets.\n\nThe interdisciplinary study of dust brings together different scientific fields: physics (solid-state, electromagnetic theory, surface physics, statistical physics, thermal physics), fractal mathematics, surface chemistry on dust grains) meteoritics, as well as every branch of astronomy and astrophysics. These disparate research areas can be linked by the following theme: the cosmic dust particles evolve cyclically; chemically, physically and dynamically. The evolution of dust traces out paths in which the Universe recycles material, in processes analogous to the daily recycling steps with which many people are familiar: production, storage, processing, collection, consumption, and discarding.\n\nObservations and measurements of cosmic dust in different regions provide an important insight into the Universe's recycling processes; in the clouds of the diffuse interstellar medium, in molecular clouds, in the circumstellar dust of young stellar objects, and in planetary systems such as the Solar System, where astronomers consider dust as in its most recycled state. The astronomers accumulate observational ‘snapshots’ of dust at different stages of its life and, over time, form a more complete movie of the Universe's complicated recycling steps.\n\nParameters such as the particle's initial motion, material properties, intervening plasma and magnetic field determined the dust particle's arrival at the dust detector. Slightly changing any of these parameters can give significantly different dust dynamical behavior. Therefore, one can learn about where that object came from, and what is (in) the intervening medium.\n\nCosmic dust can be detected by indirect methods that utilize the radiative properties of the cosmic dust particles.\n\nCosmic dust can also be detected directly ('in-situ') using a variety of collection methods and from a variety of collection locations. Estimates of the daily influx of extraterrestrial material entering the Earth's atmosphere range between 5 and 300 tonnes.\n\nNASA collects samples of star dust particles in the Earth's atmosphere using plate collectors under the wings of stratospheric-flying airplanes. Dust samples are also collected from surface deposits on the large Earth ice-masses (Antarctica and Greenland/the Arctic) and in deep-sea sediments.\n\nDon Brownlee at the University of Washington in Seattle first reliably identified the extraterrestrial nature of collected dust particles in the latter 1970s. Another source is the meteorites, which contain stardust extracted from them. Stardust grains are solid refractory pieces of individual presolar stars. They are recognized by their extreme isotopic compositions, which can only be isotopic compositions within evolved stars, prior to any mixing with the interstellar medium. These grains condensed from the stellar matter as it cooled while leaving the star.\n\nIn interplanetary space, dust detectors on planetary spacecraft have been built and flown, some are presently flying, and more are presently being built to fly. The large orbital velocities of dust particles in interplanetary space (typically 10–40 km/s) make intact particle capture problematic. Instead, in-situ dust detectors are generally devised to measure parameters associated with the high-velocity impact of dust particles on the instrument, and then derive physical properties of the particles (usually mass and velocity) through laboratory calibration (i.e. impacting accelerated particles with known properties onto a laboratory replica of the dust detector). Over the years dust detectors have measured, among others, the impact light flash, acoustic signal and impact ionisation. Recently the dust instrument on Stardust captured particles intact in low-density aerogel.\n\nDust detectors in the past flew on the HEOS-2, \"Helios\", \"Pioneer 10\", \"Pioneer 11\", \"Giotto\", \"Galileo\" and \"Cassini\" space missions, on the Earth-orbiting LDEF, EURECA, and Gorid satellites, and some scientists have utilized the \"Voyager 1\" and \"2\" spacecraft as giant Langmuir probes to directly sample the cosmic dust. Presently dust detectors are flying on the \"Ulysses\", Proba, \"Rosetta\", \"Stardust\", and the \"New Horizons\" spacecraft. The collected dust at Earth or collected further in space and returned by sample-return space missions is then analyzed by dust scientists in their respective laboratories all over the world. One large storage facility for cosmic dust exists at the NASA Houston JSC.\n\nInfrared light can penetrate cosmic dust clouds, allowing us to peer into regions of star formation and the centers of galaxies. NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope is the largest infrared telescope yet launched into space. It was carried by a Delta rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida on 25 August 2003. During its mission, Spitzer obtained images and spectra by detecting the thermal radiation emitted by objects in space between wavelengths of 3 and 180 micrometres. Most of this infrared radiation is blocked by the Earth's atmosphere and cannot be observed from the ground. Findings from the Spitzer have revitalized the studies of cosmic dust. One report showed some evidence that cosmic dust is formed near a supermassive black hole.\n\nAnother detection mechanism is polarimetry. Dust grains are not spherical and tend to align to interstellar magnetic fields, preferentially polarizing starlight that passes through dust clouds. In nearby interstellar space, where interstellar reddening is not intense enough to be detected, high precision optical polarimetry has been used to glean the structure of dust within the Local Bubble.\n\nIn 2019, researchers found interstellar dust in Antarctica which they relate to the Local Interstellar Cloud. The detection of interstellar dust in Antarctica was done by the measurement of the radionuclides Fe-60 and Mn-53 by highly sensitive Accelerator mass spectrometry.\n\nA dust particle interacts with electromagnetic radiation in a way that depends on its cross section, the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation, and on the nature of the grain: its refractive index, size, etc. The radiation process for an individual grain is called its \"emissivity\", dependent on the grain's \"efficiency factor\". Furthermore, we have to specify whether the emissivity process is extinction, scattering, absorption, or polarisation. In the radiation emission curves, several important signatures identify the composition of the emitting or absorbing dust particles.\n\nDust particles can scatter light nonuniformly. Forward scattered light is light that is redirected slightly off its path by diffraction, and back-scattered light is reflected light.\n\nThe scattering and extinction (\"dimming\") of the radiation gives useful information about the dust grain sizes. For example, if the object(s) in one's data is many times brighter in forward-scattered visible light than in back-scattered visible light, then we know that a significant fraction of the particles are about a micrometer in diameter.\n\nThe scattering of light from dust grains in long exposure visible photographs is quite noticeable in reflection nebulae, and gives clues about the individual particle's light-scattering properties. In X-ray wavelengths, many scientists are investigating the scattering of X-rays by interstellar dust, and some have suggested that astronomical X-ray sources would possess diffuse haloes, due to the dust.\n\nStardust grains (also called presolar grains by meteoriticists) are contained within meteorites, from which they are extracted in terrestrial laboratories. Stardust was a component of the dust in the interstellar medium before its incorporation into meteorites. The meteorites have stored those stardust grains ever since the meteorites first assembled within the planetary accretion disk more than four billion years ago. So-called carbonaceous chondrites are especially fertile reservoirs of stardust. Each stardust grain existed before the Earth was formed. \"Stardust\" is a scientific term referring to refractory dust grains that condensed from cooling ejected gases from individual presolar stars and incorporated into the cloud from which the Solar System condensed.\n\nMany different types of stardust have been identified by laboratory measurements of the highly unusual isotopic composition of the chemical elements that comprise each stardust grain. These refractory mineral grains may earlier have been coated with volatile compounds, but those are lost in the dissolving of meteorite matter in acids, leaving only insoluble refractory minerals. Finding the grain cores without dissolving most of the meteorite has been possible, but difficult and labor-intensive (see presolar grains).\n\nMany new aspects of nucleosynthesis have been discovered from the isotopic ratios within the stardust grains. An important property of stardust is the hard, refractory, high-temperature nature of the grains. Prominent are silicon carbide, graphite, aluminium oxide, aluminium spinel, and other such solids that would condense at high temperature from a cooling gas, such as in stellar winds or in the decompression of the inside of a supernova. They differ greatly from the solids formed at low temperature within the interstellar medium.\n\nAlso important are their extreme isotopic compositions, which are expected to exist nowhere in the interstellar medium. This also suggests that the stardust condensed from the gases of individual stars before the isotopes could be diluted by mixing with the interstellar medium. These allow the source stars to be identified. For example, the heavy elements within the silicon carbide (SiC) grains are almost pure S-process isotopes, fitting their condensation within AGB star red giant winds inasmuch as the AGB stars are the main source of S-process nucleosynthesis and have atmospheres observed by astronomers to be highly enriched in dredged-up s process elements.\n\nAnother dramatic example is given by the so-called supernova condensates, usually shortened by acronym to SUNOCON (from SUperNOva CONdensate) to distinguish them from other stardust condensed within stellar atmospheres. SUNOCONs contain in their calcium an excessively large abundance of Ca, demonstrating that they condensed containing abundant radioactive Ti, which has a 65-year half-life. The outflowing Ti nuclei were thus still \"alive\" (radioactive) when the SUNOCON condensed near one year within the expanding supernova interior, but would have become an extinct radionuclide (specifically Ca) after the time required for mixing with the interstellar gas. Its discovery proved the prediction from 1975 that it might be possible to identify SUNOCONs in this way. The SiC SUNOCONs (from supernovae) are only about 1% as numerous as are SiC stardust from AGB stars.\n\nStardust itself (SUNOCONs and AGB grains that come from specific stars) is but a modest fraction of the condensed cosmic dust, forming less than 0.1% of the mass of total interstellar solids. The high interest in stardust derives from new information that it has brought to the sciences of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis.\n\nLaboratories have studied solids that existed before the Earth was formed. This was once thought impossible, especially in the 1970s when cosmochemists were confident that the Solar System began as a hot gas virtually devoid of any remaining solids, which would have been vaporized by high temperature. The existence of stardust proved this historic picture incorrect.\n\n Cosmic dust is made of dust grains and aggregates into dust particles. These particles are irregularly shaped, with porosity ranging from \"fluffy\" to \"compact\". The composition, size, and other properties depend on where the dust is found, and conversely, a compositional analysis of a dust particle can reveal much about the dust particle's origin. General diffuse interstellar medium dust, dust grains in dense clouds, planetary rings dust, and circumstellar dust, are each different in their characteristics. For example, grains in dense clouds have acquired a mantle of ice and on average are larger than dust particles in the diffuse interstellar medium. \"Interplanetary dust particles\" (IDPs) are generally larger still.\nMost of the influx of extraterrestrial matter that falls onto the Earth is dominated by meteoroids with diameters in the range 50 to 500 micrometers, of average density 2.0 g/cm³ (with porosity about 40%). The total influx rate of meteoritic sities of most IDPs captured in the Earth's stratosphere range between 1 and 3 g/cm³, with an average density at about 2.0 g/cm³.\n\nOther specific dust properties: in \"circumstellar dust\", astronomers have found molecular signatures of CO, silicon carbide, amorphous silicate, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, water ice, and polyformaldehyde, among others (in the diffuse interstellar medium, there is evidence for silicate and carbon grains). \"Cometary dust\" is generally different (with overlap) from \"asteroidal dust\". Asteroidal dust resembles carbonaceous chondritic meteorites. Cometary dust resembles interstellar grains which can include silicates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and water ice.\n\nThe large grains in interstellar space are probably complex, with refractory cores that condensed within stellar outflows topped by layers acquired during incursions into cold dense interstellar clouds. That cyclic process of growth and destruction outside of the clouds has been modeled to demonstrate that the cores live much longer than the average lifetime of dust mass. Those cores mostly start with silicate particles condensing in the atmospheres of cool, oxygen-rich red-giants and carbon grains condensing in the atmospheres of cool carbon stars. Red giants have evolved or altered off the main sequence and have entered the giant phase of their evolution and are the major source of refractory dust grain cores in galaxies. Those refractory cores are also called stardust (section above), which is a scientific term for the small fraction of cosmic dust that condensed thermally within stellar gases as they were ejected from the stars. Several percent of refractory grain cores have condensed within expanding interiors of supernovae, a type of cosmic decompression chamber. Meteoriticists who study refractory stardust (extracted from meteorites) often call it presolar grains but that within meteorites is only a small fraction of all presolar dust. Stardust condenses within the stars via considerably different condensation chemistry than that of the bulk of cosmic dust, which accretes cold onto preexisting dust in dark molecular clouds of the galaxy. Those molecular clouds are very cold, typically less than 50K, so that ices of many kinds may accrete onto grains, in cases only to be destroyed or split apart by radiation and sublimation into a gas component. Finally, as the Solar System formed many interstellar dust grains were further modified by coalescence and chemical reactions in the planetary accretion disk. The history of the various types of grains in the early Solar System is complicated and only partially understood.\n\nAstronomers know that the dust is formed in the envelopes of late-evolved stars from specific observational signatures. In infrared light, emission at 9.7 micrometres is a signature of silicate dust in cool evolved oxygen-rich giant stars. Emission at 11.5 micrometres indicates the presence of silicon carbide dust in cool evolved carbon-rich giant stars. These help provide evidence that the small silicate particles in space came from the ejected outer envelopes of these stars.\n\nConditions in interstellar space are generally not suitable for the formation of silicate cores. This would take excessive time to accomplish, even if it might be possible. The arguments are that: given an observed typical grain diameter \"a\", the time for a grain to attain \"a\", and given the temperature of interstellar gas, it would take considerably longer than the age of the Universe for interstellar grains to form. On the other hand, grains are seen to have recently formed in the vicinity of nearby stars, in nova and supernova ejecta, and in R Coronae Borealis variable stars which seem to eject discrete clouds containing both gas and dust. So mass loss from stars is unquestionably where the refractory cores of grains formed.\n\nMost dust in the Solar System is highly processed dust, recycled from the material out of which the Solar System formed and subsequently collected in the planetesimals, and leftover solid material such as comets and asteroids, and reformed in each of those bodies' collisional lifetimes. During the Solar System's formation history, the most abundant element was (and still is) H. The metallic elements: magnesium, silicon, and iron, which are the principal ingredients of rocky planets, condensed into solids at the highest temperatures of the planetary disk. Some molecules such as CO, N, NH, and free oxygen, existed in a gas phase. Some molecules, for example, graphite (C) and SiC would condense into solid grains in the planetary disk; but carbon and SiC grains found in meteorites are presolar based on their isotopic compositions, rather than from the planetary disk formation. Some molecules also formed complex organic compounds and some molecules formed frozen ice mantles, of which either could coat the \"refractory\" (Mg, Si, Fe) grain cores. Stardust once more provides an exception to the general trend, as it appears to be totally unprocessed since its thermal condensation within stars as refractory crystalline minerals. The condensation of graphite occurs within supernova interiors as they expand and cool, and do so even in gas containing more oxygen than carbon, a surprising carbon chemistry made possible by the intense radioactive environment of supernovae. This special example of dust formation has merited specific review.\n\nPlanetary disk formation of precursor molecules was determined, in large part, by the temperature of the solar nebula. Since the temperature of the solar nebula decreased with heliocentric distance, scientists can infer a dust grain's origin(s) with knowledge of the grain's materials. Some materials could only have been formed at high temperatures, while other grain materials could only have been formed at much lower temperatures. The materials in a single interplanetary dust particle often show that the grain elements formed in different locations and at different times in the solar nebula. Most of the matter present in the original solar nebula has since disappeared; drawn into the Sun, expelled into interstellar space, or reprocessed, for example, as part of the planets, asteroids or comets.\n\nDue to their highly processed nature, IDPs (interplanetary dust particles) are fine-grained mixtures of thousands to millions of mineral grains and amorphous components. We can picture an IDP as a \"matrix\" of material with embedded elements which were formed at different times and places in the solar nebula and before the solar nebula's formation. Examples of embedded elements in cosmic dust are GEMS, chondrules, and CAIs.\n\nThe arrows in the adjacent diagram show one possible path from a collected interplanetary dust particle back to the early stages of the solar nebula.\n\nWe can follow the trail to the right in the diagram to the IDPs that contain the most volatile and primitive elements. The trail takes us first from interplanetary dust particles to chondritic interplanetary dust particles. Planetary scientists classify chondritic IDPs in terms of their diminishing degree of oxidation so that they fall into three major groups: the carbonaneous, the ordinary, and the enstatite chondrites. As the name implies, the carbonaceous chondrites are rich in carbon, and many have anomalies in the isotopic abundances of H, C, N, and O (Jessberger, 2000). From the carbonaceous chondrites, we follow the trail to the most primitive materials. They are almost completely oxidized and contain the lowest condensation temperature elements (\"volatile\" elements) and the largest amount of organic compounds. Therefore, dust particles with these elements are thought to have been formed in the early life of the Solar System. The volatile elements have never seen temperatures above about 500 K, therefore, the IDP grain \"matrix\" consists of some very primitive Solar System material. Such a scenario is true in the case of comet dust. The provenance of the small fraction that is stardust (see above) is quite different; these refractory interstellar minerals thermally condense within stars, become a small component of interstellar matter, and therefore remain in the presolar planetary disk. Nuclear damage tracks are caused by the ion flux from solar flares. Solar wind ions impacting on the particle's surface produce amorphous radiation damaged rims on the particle's surface. And spallogenic nuclei are produced by galactic and solar cosmic rays. A dust particle that originates in the Kuiper Belt at 40 AU would have many more times the density of tracks, thicker amorphous rims and higher integrated doses than a dust particle originating in the main-asteroid belt.\n\nBased on 2012 computer model studies, the complex organic molecules necessary for life (Extraterrestrial organic molecules) may have formed in the protoplanetary disk of dust grains surrounding the Sun before the formation of the Earth. According to the computer studies, this same process may also occur around other stars that acquire planets.\n\nIn September 2012, NASA scientists reported that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), subjected to interstellar medium (ISM) conditions, are transformed, through hydrogenation, oxygenation and hydroxylation, to more complex organics – \"a step along the path toward amino acids and nucleotides, the raw materials of proteins and DNA, respectively\". Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their spectroscopic signature which could be one of the reasons \"for the lack of PAH detection in interstellar ice grains, particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of protoplanetary disks.\"\n\nIn February 2014, NASA announced a greatly upgraded database for detecting and monitoring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the universe. According to NASA scientists, over 20% of the carbon in the Universe may be associated with PAHs, possible starting materials for the formation of life. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the Big Bang, are abundant in the Universe, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets.\n\nIn March 2015, NASA scientists reported that, for the first time, complex DNA and RNA organic compounds of life, including uracil, cytosine and thymine, have been formed in the laboratory under outer space conditions, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the Universe, may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar dust and gas clouds, according to the scientists.\n\nThe Solar System has its own interplanetary dust cloud, as do extrasolar systems. There are different types of nebulae with different physical causes and processes: diffuse nebula, infrared (IR) reflection nebula, supernova remnant, molecular cloud, HII regions, photodissociation regions, and dark nebula.\n\nDistinctions between those types of nebula are that different radiation processes are at work. For example, H II regions, like the Orion Nebula, where a lot of star-formation is taking place, are characterized as thermal emission nebulae. Supernova remnants, on the other hand, like the Crab Nebula, are characterized as nonthermal emission (synchrotron radiation).\n\nSome of the better known dusty regions in the Universe are the diffuse nebulae in the Messier catalog, for example: M1, M8, M16, M17, M20, M42, M43.\n\nSome larger dust catalogs are Sharpless (1959) A Catalogue of HII Regions, Lynds (1965) Catalogue of Bright Nebulae, Lynds (1962) Catalogue of Dark Nebulae, van den Bergh (1966) Catalogue of Reflection Nebulae, Green (1988) Rev. Reference Cat. of Galactic SNRs, The National Space Sciences Data Center (NSSDC), and CDS Online Catalogs.\n\nThe Discovery program's \"Stardust\" mission, was launched on 7 February 1999 to collect samples from the coma of comet Wild 2, as well as samples of cosmic dust. It returned samples to Earth on 15 January 2006. In the spring of 2014, the recovery of particles of interstellar dust from the samples was announced.\n\n"}

They were required to part with all modern technology including cell phones, laptops, and MP3 players, as well as all modern clothing and lingo, only to adopt their cultural equivalents of the 1970s. It was billed as a competition to see who can \"be the most 70s.\"\n\nThe twelve contestants were: Andrew Severyn, Ashley McCarthy, Corey Hartwyk, Geo Herrera, Hailley Howard, Jami Stallings, Joey Mendicino, Lynda Khristine, Lee Wireman, Peter Asencio, Ruben Gonzalez, and Sarah Bray.\n\nOn each episode contestants were assigned tasks by Oscar, the house's unseen owner who communicated over speakerphone in an obvious parody of Charlie from Charlie's Angels. Dawn, the peppy host, acted as a liaison between the contestants and Oscar and instructed them on how to complete the tasks. After finishing the task Oscar awarded a prize to the contestant (or team) which best completed the task.

They are inhabited mainly by tribal dwellers, the majority of whom are Garo people. It is one of the wettest places in the world. The range is part of the Meghalaya subtropical forests ecoregion.\n\nPeople who reside in the Garo Hills are known as the Garos. Besides the Garo hills, there are Garo settlements in the plains of Assam and Bangladesh. The Garos call themselves \"A·chik\" (locally used).\n\nGaro Hills comprises five districts. Tura is the largest town with a population of about 70,000 located at the foothills of often cloud covered Tura peak. The town is centrally located to other popular game and wildlife sanctuaries in the district such as the national parks of Balphakram and Nokrek, and several natural limestone caves (the Siju Cave is among the longest in Asia). These places are rich reserves of natural flora and fauna and a refuge for endangered animals.\n\nThe traditional Garo female dress is a piece of cloth around the waist and a blouse or vest. The men usually wear, in addition to cloth, a turban. Males and females both wear bangles and earrings. The staple cereal food is rice. They also eat millet, maize, tapioca etc. Garos are very liberal in their food habits. Practically all available types of meat and animals are eaten. The liquor is not distilled, but prepared by brewing food grains.\n\nThe society is matrilineal like the Khasis and the Jaintias. Till death, the newborn baby belongs to the mother's family, irrespective of sex, even after marriage. Marriage within the clan is completely prohibited and severely punishable for both the Khasis and the Garos. Till now, the institution of Bachelors dormitories which is gradually disappearing amongst the tribes of northeastern region, are found in the Garo villages. In such dormitories young people stay and live together till they are married. They receive various training in the dormitories like making various A'chik music instruments, wrestling or traditional sports, making of traditional bamboo baskets. This institution is similar to ancient agoges of Sparta. The Khasis and Garos are now mostly Christians. Before that they were nature-worshipers.\n\nGaro Hills known for its abundance of wildlife attracts naturalists and photographers to capture the multifaceted sights of a unique range of flora and fauna. Two mountain ranges - the Arabella range and the Tura range, pass through the Garo Hills, forming the great Balpakram valley in between. The headquarters town of Tura is 323 km from the state capital Shillong via Guwahati, at an altitude of 657 m. The highest point in the Garo Hills is Nokrek Peak with elevation of 1412 m.\n\nTura has a picturesque landscape of hills against a backdrop of low-lying plains. A sunset view can be best seen from Tura Peak at 1,400 m and its summit can be reached by a 5 km trek, partly by hiking and also by rock-climbing.\n\nThese are locations in and around Garo Hills which are tourist spots.

It was released in 1971 as the B-side to the single \"After Forever\".\n\nThe exact inspiration behind \"Fairies Wear Boots\" is unclear. In the 2010 documentary film \"Classic Albums: Black Sabbath's Paranoid\", the band's bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler states that he composed the lyrics after a violent encounter with skinheads in London, who are the \"fairies\" in the song. However, in the 2004 release of \"\", guitarist Tony Iommi states that the lyrics were inspired by an incident in which Butler and vocalist Ozzy Osbourne were smoking cannabis and witnessed what they believed to be fairies in a park In Osbourne's autobiography \"I Am Ozzy\", he stated that he does not recall what the song was written about. \n\nOn original 1970 US copies of the \"Paranoid\" album, the song's intro was listed under the title \"Jack the Stripper\".\n\nThe song has been ranked the 11th best Black Sabbath song by author Christoph Rehe.\n\nA live version of \"Fairies Wear Boots\", taken from a session for the BBC's John Peel \"Sunday Show\" dated April 26, 1970, is featured on the bonus disc of a 1997 Ozzy Osbourne compilation entitled \"The Ozzman Cometh\". The song also appears on the Black Sabbath's first compilation album, \"We Sold Our Soul for Rock 'n' Roll\".\n\nOsbourne released a live rendition of the song on his 1982 solo album \"Speak of the Devil\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2178587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2178587", "title": "Rake (theatre)", "text": "Rake (theatre)\n\nEnglish theatre stages in the Middle Ages and early Modern era typically sloped upwards away from the audience. This is known as a rake or raked stage and improves the view and sound for the audience. Raked seating refers to seating which is positioned on an upwards slope away from the stage, in order to give those in the audience at the back a better view than if the seats were all on the same level.\n\nThe slope of the rake is measured by the number of horizontal units it takes for one vertical unit measured in the direction of the slope, or by the equivalent percentage. A rake of one horizontal unit to one vertical unit (1 in 1) would give an angle of 45° from the horizontal. Rakes of 1 in 18 (5.56%) to 1 in 48 (2.08%) were more common. \n\nConverting the rake ratio to an angle requires the application of some basic trigonometry. The angle in degrees = arctan(vertical/horizontal), where \"vertical\" is the vertical rise in distance and \"horizontal\" is the horizontal distance over which this rise occurs. For example, for a rake of 1:18, the corresponding angle is arctan(1/18) = 3.18°.\n\nTheatres constructed after the beginning of the 20th century feature a raked audience section. This change back to the method of construction seen in Greek and Roman theaters (flat stage and terraced audience) was effected due the difficulty encountered when one tries to walk across a sloped surface, which had resulted in unnatural movement patterns to avoid the appearance of limping caused by the non-level surface.\n\nRaked stages can still be seen in some opera, Broadway and West End productions, where a temporary raked acting surface is built over a theatre's permanent flat stage. Creating a raked stage can also assist set designs which are designed with forced perspective.\n\nOn a raked stage an actor who is further from the audience is higher than an actor who is closer to the audience. This led to the theatre positions \"upstage\" and \"downstage\", meaning, respectively, further from or closer to the audience.\n\nThe term \"upstaging\" refers to one actor moving to a more elevated position on the rake (stage), causing the upstaged actor (who stays more downstage, closer to the audience) to turn their back to the audience to address the cast member. The term \"upstaging\" has also since taken on the figurative meaning of an actor unscrupulously drawing the audience's attention away from another actor.\n"}

The range is part of the Patkai range system and its highest point is 2,157 m high Phawngpui, also known as 'Blue Mountain'.\n\nThe hills are for the most part covered with dense bamboo jungle and rank undergrowth; but in the eastern portion, owing probably to a smaller rainfall, open grass-covered slopes are found, with groves of oak and pine interspersed with rhododendrons. The Blue Mountain is the highest peak in Lushai hills.\n\nThese hills are inhabited by the Lushais and other Mizo tribes, but the population is extremely scanty. From the earliest known times the original inhabitants were Kukis, and the Lushais were not heard of until 1840, when they invaded the district from the north. Their first attack upon British territory took place in November 1849, and after that date they proved one of the most troublesome tribes on the north-east frontier of India; but operations in 1890 resulted in the complete pacification of the northern Lushai villages, and in 1892 the eastern Lushais were reduced to order.\n\nThe management of the South Lushai hill country was transferred from Bengal to Assam in 1898. To obtain more efficient control over the country the district has been divided into eighteen circles, each in charge of an interpreter, through whom all orders are transmitted to the chiefs.\n\n\n"}

Soon after graduation, he joined a few of the studio's troupes that would accompany popular singers during their live performances. He worked with artists such as Alan Tam, Leslie Cheung, and Anita Mui before being invited by a producer to make a record of his own.\n\nIn 1994, he made his film debut with \"Twenty Something\". Chan has since received several Hong Kong Film Award nominations: two for his role in \"He's a Woman, She's a Man\" (1994), and one each for \"Heaven Can't Wait\" (1995) and \"Big Bullet\" (1996). With 1996's \"Young and Dangerous\", Chan established himself as a mainstay of the triad genre. The film was a huge success, and led to nine sequels and spinoffs before the series concluded in 2000. In 2005, Chan starred alongside Jay Chou as Kyoichi Sudo in \"Initial D\".\n\nMusically, Chan is known for bringing a hip hop flavour to cantopop. With his recent releases beginning around 2002, he has rapped and added hip hop beats to his music. His hip hop style has brought him new fans, although some Hong Kong fans have accused him of acting \"black.\" He continues to incorporate R&B and hip hop sounds into his music today.\n\nChan has spoken several lines of Hakka in some of his movies. He is the first singer to include Hakka verse in a Mandarin song, \"Heartless You\", (算你恨), 2003.\n\nChan married actress Cherrie Ying (應采兒) on Valentine's Day, 14 February 2010, at Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, though they intended to have their reception in Hong Kong.\n\nThey had their first child, Jasper Chan, born on July 1, 2013.\n\n\n\nIn 2016 Hong Kong Legislative Election, Chan had openly endorsed pro-Beijing candidate Junius Ho.\n\nIn May 2019, the government had introduced the extradition bill, which had triggered huge protest around the world. Upon being asked, Chan said he did not know but nevertheless sign the supportive petition. \n\nIn August 2019, he posted a video on Instagram criticizing the protestors as 打靶仔 (People that should go to die), stating that he would rather being ruled by Beijing but not being impeded by the protestors.\n\n"}

A sugar coating was later added to the drops, slightly altering their taste.\n\nThe most famous form of Pantteri, however, is the larger, sugar coated disc-shaped candies sold in a plastic bag, also with a picture of a panther on it. At first only salmiakki Pantteri candies were available, but in the 1990s Fazer introduced a fruit-flavoured version of Pantteri, \"Pantteri Mix\" (containing red, yellow and green fruit candies and normal salmiakki candies).\n\nIn the 2000s, the Pantteri drops sold in boxes were reverted to the original 1965 version, without the sugar coating. The text on the box says \"Original Pantteri drops from 1965\".\n\nLater additions include \"Lumipantteri Mix\" (Finnish for \"snow panther\") in summer 2006, \"Pantteri Mix\" candies with white coating, \"Musta Pantteri\" (Finnish for \"black panther\"), which has a slightly higher ammonium chloride content than the regular salmiakki Pantteri, and \"Pantteri Black Shot\", candies with a salty liquorice filling.\n\nDiscontinued variations include \"Yöpantteri Mix\" (\"night panther\") featuring fruit and salmiakki candies, shaped like panthers, stars and moons and \"Rock Pantteri Mix\", containing many different salty liquorice and fruit candies.\n\nVisible advertising campaigns are an important part of Pantteri's publicity image. They were awarded as best advertising campaign in Finland twice, in 1999 and 2000. One advertising campaign featured a fictional latino character called \"El Pantero\", sporting advertising slogans in mock Spanish such as \"El Pantero baila\" and \"Baila y come\". The current advertising campaign promotes \"Panthóur\", a humorous variation of the popular parkour sport.\n\n\n\n"}

Iommi overdubbed flute to the reversed multitrack master which was then re-forwarded and treated with stereo delay. \n\nOn 31 May, 2020, \"Planet Caravan\" was selected by SpaceX as the wake-up music for the crew of a SpaceX Crew Dragon prior to the craft's launch later that day.

The museum was established in 1867 with Julius von Haast – whose collection formed its core – as its first director. The building is registered as a \"Historic Place – Category I \" by Heritage New Zealand.\n\nThe title curator and director has been used interchangeably during the history of Canterbury Museum. Von Haast was the museum's inaugural director; Haast died in 1887. Following Haast's death, Frederick Wollaston Hutton was acting director until Henry Ogg Forbes took on a permanent position in December 1888 upon his return from England. In August 1892, Forbes permanently moved to England, and Hutton was appointed full director from May 1892 until October 1905. Hutton applied for leave to travel to England, and Charles Chilton was acting director from March 1905; Hutton died on his return journey from England and Chilton retained his acting role until April 1906, when Edgar Ravenswood Waite received a permanent appointment. Waite was director for eight years until March 1914, when he took the equivalent role at the South Australian Museum.\n\nRobert Speight, who had already been acting director in 1911, was appointed as Waite's successor in March 1914. Speight retired from this role in November 1935. Speight was succeeded by two acting directors who worked alongside one another; the geologist Robin Allan, and the zoologist Edgar Percival. They were succeeded by Robert Falla, who commenced his role on 1 March 1937 and who was director until 1947, when he accepted the same position at the Dominion Museum in Wellington. Walter Reginald Brock Oliver was acting director from November 1947 to September 1948. Roger Duff, who had been acting director on several occasions during Falla's tenure prior to Oliver, succeeded Falla as director from September 1948 until his sudden death on 30 October 1978. John Crum Wilson succeeded Duff as acting director from October 1978 to February 1979, and then as full director until February 1983. The archaeologist Michael Malthus Trotter succeeded him as director from March 1983 to December 1995. Stephen Phillips had an interim position from January to March 1996 until the current director, Anthony Wright, was appointed in March 1996.\n\nThe building, a Gothic Revival constructed on a design by Benjamin Mountfort, opened in 1870. Two years after its opening, the single-storey building was expanded with an additional floor in the Victorian Gothic style. The museum continued to grow over the next decade, with an addition built on in 1876 and an interior courtyard roofed in 1882. In 1958, a new wing was added adjacent to Christ's College, and another was built on in 1977. The building was strengthened in the mid-1990s and a four-storey block was added in 1995.\n\nThe museum sustained minor damage to its façade during the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, but remains structurally sound. This can perhaps be attributed to the progressive strengthening and renovating of the buildings to earthquake standards between 1987 and 1995. An estimated 95% of the collections were unharmed. The statue of William Rolleston, located at the front of the museum, toppled off its plinth during the quake. The museum reopened on 2 September 2011.\n\n\n"}

In around 1117 AD, the Hoysalas under Vishnuvardhana captured Talakad and among his conquests, he captured Kolar and drove the Cholas from Mysore state. On the death of Somesvara, in 1254, a partition of Hoysala dominions took place between his two sons and the Kolar district was included with the provinces to the share of Ramanatha. However, the next king Ballala III reunited the Hoysala dominions.\n\nKolar is much older than Bangalore, its origin going back to the 2nd century AD. Gangas made Kolar their capital and ruled over Mysore, Coimbatore, Salem and Trave. In the 13th Century AD, Sage Bhavanandi composed his treatise on Tamil grammar Nannool at the Ulagamadhi cave at KGF, under the patronage of Seeya Gangan one of the Ganga rulers who was born in Kolar and was a patron of arts and literature. Further Seeya Gangan's inscriptions indicate that Kolar regained control of Kolar for the second time from Chola hands.\n\nDuring the reign of the Cholas, King Uththama Chola (970 AD) is said to have built the temple for Goddess Renuka. The Chola rulers Veera Chola, Vikrama Chola and Raja Nagendra Chola erected stone structures with inscriptions at Avani, Mulbagal, Sitti Bettta and other places. Chola inscriptions also indicate the rule of Adithya Chola I (871-907 AD), Raja Raja Chola I and Rajendra Chola I over Kolar. These inscriptions refer to Kolar as 'Nikarili Cholamandalam' and also as 'Jayam Konda Chola Manadalam'. Inscriptions of Rajendra Chola I also appear on the Kolaramma Temple. Many Siva temples were built in Kolar during the reign of the Cholas, such as the Someshwarar Temple at Marikuppam Village, Sri Uddhandeshwari Temple at Marikuppam Village, the Eswaran Temple at Oorugaumpet, the Sivan Temple at Madivala Village. The reign of the Cholas over Kolar lasted till 1116 AD. Sadly, the Chola inscriptions scattered all over Kolar lie neglected, and some subject to wilful cultural vandalism. According to B. Lewis Rice, this story is evidently based on some confused reminiscence of certain names and historical events. From the records of the period, we know that the Cholas subverted the power of the Gangas by the capture of Talakad in about 1004, and speedily possessed themselves of all the south and east of Mysore. The important city of Kolahala, or Kolar, thus became subject to them, together with the whole of the present Kolar District.\n\nIn 1117 AD, Kolar came under the reign of the Hoysalas, and in 1254 AD, the dominions were portioned among the two sons of King Someshwara, with Kolar included in the provinces that went to Ramanatha. The next king, Ballala III, however reunited the Hoysala dominions.\n\nThe Hoysala were defeated by the Vijaynagar Kingdom, and their rule over Kolar lasted from 1336-1664. During their reign, the Sri Someshwara Temple at Kolar was built. During this time, in 1418, Thimme Gowda of the Morasu Vokkalu clan struck a treaty with the Vijayanagar Kings and ruled the Kolar District. His successors ruled for over four generations.\n\nIn the 17th Century, Kolar came under Maratha rule as part of the Jahagir of Shahaji for fifty years. Then under Muslim rule for seventy years. In 1720 AD, Kolar came under the Suba of Sira, with Fateh Mohammed, the father of Hyder Ali becoming the Faujdar of the province. After this Kolar passed through different reigns such as Marathas, the Nawab of Cuddapah, Nizam of Hyderabad and finally Hyder Ali. In 1768, Kolar came under British rule briefly till 1770, then passed briefly again to Maratha rule and again Hyder Ali. In 1791 Lord Cornwallis conquered Kolar, before passing it back to Mysore under the peace treaty of 1792. Kolar has been part of the Mysore State since that time.\n\nAround the Kolar region, there are numerous inscriptions which indicate reign of the Mahavalis (Baanaas), Kadambas, Chalukyas, Pallava, Vaidumbaas, Rastrakutas, Cholas, Hoysalas and Mysore kings at different points of time. Benjamin Lewis Rice recorded 1347 inscriptions in the Kolar District, in the 10th volume of Epigraphia Carnatica. Out of these inscriptions 714 inscriptions are in Kannada\n422 are in Tamil, 211 in Telugu.\n\nWith the growth of the Gold Mines and the resulting demand for labour, people from Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Salem, the North and South Arcot districts of Tamil Nadu and Chittoor, Madanapalli and Ananthapur districts of Andhra Pradesh, were settled around the various shafts.\n\nWith time, the habitations expanded to merge into each other to form the outer reaches of the town of KGF. In the core of the town were the families of British and Indian engineers, geologists and mine supervisors who lived a grand colonial lifestyle completed with Golf course, Tennis court, club with dance halls and bars, cottages and Bungalows with gardens and quarters for the employees and Churches and chapels.\n\nThe ruins of these structures and some memorabilia continue to exist even today. Many places in the area have names reminiscent of the Raj. The two main townships which came up subsequently in KGF were Robertsonpet and Andersonpet, named after two British officers in the mines.\n\nIn June 1902, electricity was supplied for the mining operations at KGF from India's first and oldest power generation plant which was called the 'Kaveri Electric Power Plant' from Shivanasamudra.\n\nSubsequent establishment of the BEML public sector enterprise brought further expansion to the city providing employment to existing populations while also bringing in new populations that added to the cosmopolitan nature of KGF.\n\nPyroclastics & Pillow lavas of Kolar Gold fields at Kolar Gold Fields(KGF) has been declared the National Geological Monuments of India by the Geological Survey of India (GSI), for their protection, maintenance, promotion and enhancement of geotourism.\n\nIn 1901, an English Medium Primary School was established by the John Taylor and Sons Company, at the Nandydoorg Mine, for providing education to the children of British and European workers of the company. It came to known as the Kolar Gold Fields Boys School Oorigaum, and was later upgraded to Middle School and then to High School, with the students appearing to Lower Cambridge and Senior Cambridge Level Exams. However this school was co-educational only up to Primary School, with girls being excluded after that.\n\nTo meet the educational requirements of girls in KGF, on 15 January 1904, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Tarbes established two schools in KGF - An English School for Europeans and Anglo Indians with 22 children. The school operated in the compound of St. Mary's Church, Champion Reefs, with Sis. Teresa of Jesus serving as Head Mistress and Y Gurupatham principal for both schools. Further, St. Mary's Boys School was established in the same St. Mary's Church compound. Funding was made available from the Mysore Government since 1927, with Rs.98 grant towards the English school. The English Convent subsequently developed into High School with Senior Cambridge Level. The St. Mary's Boys School was moved to Andersonpet after an airblast incident.\n\nIn 1933, the Order of the St. Joseph of Tarbes started the St. Theresa's School in Robertsonpet and then in 1943, the St. Sebastian's School at Coromandel. With both schools offering English instruction.\n\nTo cater to the educational needs to the growing Marwai population at KGF, the Sumathi Jain High School was established in Robertsonpet.\n\nKGF has a Dental College which is KGF College of Dental Science & Hospital, an Engineering College which is Dr. T. Thimmaiah Institute of Technology(DR.TTIT) (Formerly known as Golden Valley Institute of Technology - GVIT), a law college- Sri Kengal Hanumanthaiya Law College, a PU college-KGF PU College ,a degree college -KGF first Grade College, Sri Bhagawan Mahaveer Jain College Kgf. KGF also has the National Institute of Rock Mechanics (NIRM) which is run by the Ministry of Mines with the help of GSI and IBM, and Vijaylakshmi college.\n\nSchools in the area include, \nSt. Teresa's School, \nSt. Joseph's School, \nSt. Mary's School, \nSt. Charles School,\nNizamia School, \nVani English High school and Higher Primary School, \nSree Mahaveer Jain School, William Richards School, Edens English Higher Primary School, \nMomin Urdu School, \nDr. Ambedkarhi Jain High School, \nKendriya Vidyalaya BEML Nagar and \nBEML Composite Junior College (BCJC),\nDon Bosco Industrial Training Institute (I.T.I)\nProposed Degree College \nKGF School of Commerce\n\nThe official language is Kannada. In Kolar district Kannada is the mainly spoken language. However, Tamil & Telugu are spoken widely as well. Most of the Tamil population trace their ancestry to Dalit labourers brought in by the British from the North Arcot, Chittoor, Salem and Dharmapuri districts of the Madras Presidency, during the late 19th century. The migration was necessary, as the local villagers were not as skilled or hardworking as Tamils.\n\nThere is also a substantial Anglo-Indian population and Arcot Mudaliar population at KGF, descendants of the mine supervisors.\n\nThe Kolar Gold mines were nationalized in 1956, and provided over 900 tonnes of Gold in total. However, they were closed by the Indian Government on 28th February 2001, due to environmental reasons, wrong pricing policy and lack of investment in new exploration. Also there were several problems regarding lack of food, water and shelter so the production was too less as compare to the investment in them . \n\nThe place is the central plot of the Kannada-language blockbuster film \"\" and its proposed sequel \"\".\n\nKolar’s Gold is a mixed media project produced by cornish folk band The Rowan Tree to tell the forgotten stories of Cornish miners, their families and their Indian counterparts who lived and worked at KGF from 1890-1940, and beyond. The first single off the album, 'And Am I Born To Die?', was released on Nov 22, 2019.\n\n\n"}

Books and services relating to the PT idea have been a staple of companies that specialise in marketing offshore financial services, tax avoidance schemes, and personal privacy services.\n\nThe perpetual traveler idea proposes that individuals live in such a way that they are not considered a legal resident of any of the countries in which they spend time or operate. By lacking a legal permanent residence status, the theory goes, they may avoid the legal obligations which accompany residency, such as income and asset taxes, social security contributions, jury duty, and military service. The idea has been described as a \"late capitalist nomadism\".\n\nThe perpetual traveler idea has been presented in terms of flag theory, wherein each flag represents one of the legal jurisdictions under which the perpetual traveller operates. The Three Flags Theory is credited to investment pundit Harry D. Schultz, who proposed that everyone should have a second passport and an address in a tax haven and that their assets should be kept outside their home country. The idea was later expanded to Five Flags to include a place where money was earned and a place for recreation.\n\nWhether to minimize governmental interference (via taxes or otherwise), or to maximize privacy, the theory proposes that each of the following should be in a separate country:\n\n\nIn 1995, financial commentator Bob Beckman commented about his residence in Monaco: \"A long time ago, I was told that the most efficient way for an individual to handle his affairs was to work one place, keep his money in a second place and live in a third place. I live in Monaco. I don't work here, my money is placed elsewhere, but managed from here.\"\n\nHarry Schultz's ideas were picked up by Scope International Limited of Waterlooville, England (not related to Scope International owned by Standard Chartered Bank), who popularized the idea through a series of books they published under the name of W.G. Hill (William G. Hill) (possibly a pseudonym) in the 1980s and 90s which were sold through classified advertising in \"The Times\". Around 1989, they published \"PT: A coherent plan for a stress-free, healthy and prosperous life without government interference, taxes or coercion\" by Hill which was said to have been \"inspired and edited by Harry Donald Schultz\" and went through up to seven editions. In 1993, they published \"PT2: The practice: freedom and privacy tactics: A reference handbook\" by Hill which also went through several editions. Other books published by Scope and said to have been written by Hill include \"Banking in silence\", \"The Monaco report\" and \"Think like a tycoon\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2178720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2178720", "title": "Koopmans' theorem", "text": "Koopmans' theorem\n\nKoopmans' theorem states that in closed-shell Hartree–Fock theory (HF), the first ionization energy of a molecular system is equal to the negative of the orbital energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). This theorem is named after Tjalling Koopmans, who published this result in 1934.\n\nKoopmans' theorem is exact in the context of restricted Hartree–Fock theory if it is assumed that the orbitals of the ion are identical to those of the neutral molecule (the \"frozen orbital\" approximation). Ionization energies calculated this way are in qualitative agreement with experiment – the first ionization energy of small molecules is often calculated with an error of less than two electron volts. Therefore, the validity of Koopmans' theorem is intimately tied to the accuracy of the underlying Hartree–Fock wavefunction. The two main sources of error are orbital relaxation, which refers to the changes in the Fock operator and Hartree–Fock orbitals when changing the number of electrons in the system, and electron correlation, referring to the validity of representing the entire many-body wavefunction using the Hartree–Fock wavefunction, i.e. a single Slater determinant composed of orbitals that are the eigenfunctions of the corresponding self-consistent Fock operator.\n\nEmpirical comparisons with experimental values and higher-quality ab initio calculations suggest that in many cases, but not all, the energetic corrections due to relaxation effects nearly cancel the corrections due to electron correlation.\n\nA similar theorem exists in density functional theory (DFT) for relating the exact first vertical ionization energy and electron affinity to the HOMO and LUMO energies, although both the derivation and the precise statement differ from that of Koopmans' theorem. Ionization energies calculated from DFT orbital energies are usually poorer than those of Koopmans' theorem, with errors much larger than two electron volts possible depending on the exchange-correlation approximation employed. The LUMO energy shows little correlation with the electron affinity with typical approximations. The error in the DFT counterpart of Koopmans' theorem is a result of the approximation employed for the exchange correlation energy functional so that, unlike in HF theory, there is the possibility of improved results with the development of better approximations.\n\nWhile Koopmans' theorem was originally stated for calculating ionization energies from restricted (closed-shell) Hartree–Fock wavefunctions, the term has since taken on a more generalized meaning as a way of using orbital energies to calculate energy changes due to changes in the number of electrons in a system.\n\nKoopmans’ theorem applies to the removal of an electron from any occupied molecular orbital to form a positive ion. Removal of the electron from different occupied molecular orbitals leads to the ion in different electronic states. The lowest of these states is the ground state and this often, but not always, arises from removal of the electron from the HOMO. The other states are excited electronic states.\n\nFor example, the electronic configuration of the HO molecule is (1a) (2a) (1b) (3a) (1b), where the symbols a, b and b are orbital labels based on molecular symmetry. From Koopmans’ theorem the energy of the 1b HOMO corresponds to the ionization energy to form the HO ion in its ground state (1a) (2a) (1b) (3a) (1b). The energy of the second-highest MO 3a refers to the ion in the excited state (1a) (2a) (1b) (3a) (1b), and so on. In this case the order of the ion electronic states corresponds to the order of the orbital energies. Excited-state ionization energies can be measured by photoelectron spectroscopy.\n\nFor HO, the near-Hartree–Fock orbital energies (with sign changed) of these orbitals are 1a 559.5, 2a 36.7 1b 19.5, 3a 15.9 and 1b 13.8 eV. The corresponding ionization energies are 539.7, 32.2, 18.5, 14.7 and 12.6 eV. As explained above, the deviations are due to the effects of orbital relaxation as well as differences in electron correlation energy between the molecular and the various ionized states.\n\nFor N in contrast, the order of orbital energies is not identical to the order of ionization energies. Near-Hartree–Fock calculations with a large basis set indicate that the 1π bonding orbital is the HOMO. However the lowest ionization energy corresponds to removal of an electron from the 3σ bonding orbital. In this case the deviation is attributed primarily to the difference in correlation energy between the two orbitals.\n\nIt is sometimes claimed that Koopmans' theorem also allows the calculation of electron affinities as the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of the respective systems. However, Koopmans' original paper makes no claim with regard to the significance of eigenvalues of the Fock operator other than that corresponding to the HOMO. Nevertheless, it is straightforward to generalize the original statement of Koopmans' to calculate the electron affinity in this sense.\n\nCalculations of electron affinities using this statement of Koopmans' theorem have been criticized on the grounds that virtual (unoccupied) orbitals do not have well-founded physical interpretations, and that their orbital energies are very sensitive to the choice of basis set used in the calculation. As the basis set becomes more complete; more and more \"molecular\" orbitals that are not really \"on\" the molecule of interest will appear, and care must be taken not to use these orbitals for estimating electron affinities.\n\nComparisons with experiment and higher-quality calculations show that electron affinities predicted in this manner are generally quite poor.\n\nKoopmans' theorem is also applicable to open-shell systems. It was previously believed that this was only in the case for removing the unpaired electron, but the validity of Koopmans’ theorem for ROHF in general has been proven provided that the correct orbital energies are used. The spin up (alpha) and spin down (beta) orbital energies do not necessarily have to be the same.\n\nKohn–Sham (KS) density functional theory (KS-DFT) admits its own version of Koopmans' theorem (sometimes called the DFT-Koopmans' theorem) very similar in spirit to that of Hartree-Fock theory. The theorem equates the first (vertical) ionization energy formula_1 of a system of formula_2 electrons to the negative of the corresponding KS HOMO energy formula_3. More generally, this relation is true even when the KS systems describes a zero-temperature ensemble with non-integer number of electrons formula_4 for integer formula_5 and formula_6. When considering formula_7 electrons the infinitesimal excess charge enters the KS LUMO of the \"N\" electron system but then the exact KS potential jumps by a constant known as the \"derivative discontinuity\". It can be argued that the vertical electron affinity is equal exactly to the negative of the sum of the LUMO energy and the derivative discontinuity.\n\nUnlike the approximate status of Koopmans' theorem in Hartree Fock theory (because of the neglect of orbital relaxation), in the exact KS mapping the theorem is exact, including the effect of orbital relaxation. A sketchy proof of this exact relation goes in three stages. First, for any finite system formula_8 determines the formula_9 asymptotic form of the density, which decays as formula_10. Next, as a corollary (since the physically interacting system has the same density as the KS system), both must have the same ionization energy. Finally, since the KS potential is zero at infinity, the ionization energy of the KS system is, by definition, the negative of its HOMO energy and thus finally: formula_11.\n\nWhile these are exact statements in the formalism of DFT, the use of approximate exchange-correlation potentials makes the calculated energies approximate and often the orbital energies are very different from the corresponding ionization energies (even by several eV!).\n\nA tuning procedure is able to \"impose\" Koopmans' theorem on DFT approximations thereby improving many of its related predictions in actual applications.\n\nIn approximate DFTs one can estimate to high degree of accuracy the deviance from Koopmans' theorem using the concept of energy curvature.\n\nIt provides excitation energies to zeroth-order and formula_12.\n\n"}

More Information.\n\nAll of Fuhua's recent achievements can be viewed at \n\nThe Records Challenge 2008 (奔向健力士)\n\nFuhua participated in the Mediacorp Channel 8 variety show \"The Records Challenge (奔向健力士)\" from February to August 2008. Fuhua went through four rounds to subsequently win the challenge. The event subsequently became the longest school wide competition that Fuhua competed in, and became the overarching theme of the year 2008 for Fuhua. The competition was also telecast on national television, alongside many other schools.\n\nThe first was the challenge \"Tunnel Ball\", in which they triumphed over Bedok Secondary School and subsequently entered the quarterfinal. Preparation took up about two weeks prior to the event. The challenge was to pass a ball under one's legs and over one's head as quickly as possible, with the last person receiving the ball running to the front to pass it again. The school that completed the most passes would be the winner. However, if one person were to drop the ball, the count would reset to zero and the school would have to start again.\n\nThe event was not without drama, for Bedok Secondary dropped the ball a few times. Fuhua too, dropped the ball and had their count restarted before recovering to win the challenge.\n\nFor the quarterfinal, Fuhua's challenge was to make a 3 metres by 4 metres balloon zoological garden and attempt to set a new Singapore Record. The school prepared by learning how to make balloons of different shapes and sizes. As almost no one had any experience with making balloon figures, everyone spent a significant amount of time learning the art. As a result, preparation time was significantly longer. Fuhua's competitor in this round was Yishun Town Secondary School and Fuhua eventually won by 2 marks (86 to 84). However, Fuhua did not receive the certificate for setting the record, as one of the rules of the competition was that the team who got the highest score would receive the certificate. The certificate eventually went to Innova Primary School.\n\nThe next challenge was to make a Singapore flag made up of 8500 drink cans, in tandem with the National Day celebrations that were around the corner. For this round, Fuhua was teamed up with Townsville Primary School and competed against Hwa Chong Institution and Innova Primary School. This round was very intensive, with students having to first gather at least 8500. They eventually gathered more than 10,000 cans. Much time was spent washing and painting these cans and many different models of stacking them were tried before settling on the version used for the actual challenge. In the end Fuhua and Townsville won by 10 marks (86 to 76), and Fuhua got into the Grand final, with the subsequent challenge to break a world record.\n\nRecord Challenge Final\n\nIn August 2008, Townsville Primary, Anglo Chinese School (Junior), Bukit Panjang Government High School as well as Fuhua Secondary School gathered at Singapore Polytechnic to break a Guinness world record of having the most people passing an egg over a 100m distance with a teaspoon. In the end, Fuhua was the first school that completed the given task and they became the Champion. The prize was a trophy and $5000 cash. The trophy now stands in the Trophy Cabinet and the cash was put into the school fund for the cost of the new Indoor Sports Hall.\n\nThe participants in the Record Challenge final were around 400 Fuhua students, with a further 100 more supporting the school. This event was one of the few times in recent years where Fuhua participated in a national competition and garnered great school support. Coincidentally it was also one where the school song never rang louder, when Fuhua became the eventual champions.\n\nSource: fuhuasec.moe.edu\n\nIt is an all-white uniform. White represents purity. There are shoulder lapels on the shirt/blouse. It is secured by metal epaulettes. The shirt/blouse has chest pockets and metal epaulettes are also placed on the pockets. The physical act of putting on the metal epaulettes on Sunday serves to remind the students to mentally prepare themselves for upcoming week of learning in school. Lower Secondary male students wear shorts while the Upper Secondary male students wear long pants. Female students wear white pleated skirts.\n\nIts attire for physical education (PE) is primarily a red shirt. The front of the shirt has a zipper. The word \"Fuhua\" and the Chinese characters \"辅华\" are placed on the top right hand corner of the front of the shirt. At the back of the PE T-shirt, \"Fuhua Secondary\" is slightly curved and spans from the left to the right.\n\nThe school blazer is bright red in colour. Students have to wear their tie with the blazer. It is to worn together with the school uniform to represent the colours of Singapore's National Flag. The blazer is commonly worn for special occasions like Open House, Speech Day Prefect Investitures. Ushers (usually prefects are the one) have to put on the blazer. The tie is blue in colour with yellow diagonal stripes. The names \"Fuhua\" and \"辅华\" is placed on the lower part of the tie.\n\nA drama was filmed in 2005. Called \"Subject to Change\", it was directed by Jason Ye. There was another film, a documentary on cosplay. This documentary won the Silver award, an improvement compared to the documentary filmed in 2004 titled 'Pets for Life', which achieved a merit award...\n\nThe school holds its speech day every year in March or April where awards are given out for academic achievement by the students. Typically, the principal will also use the ceremony to deliver the school report to the parents and dignitaries present.\n\nSports Day was an annual event in Fuhua from the period 2000 to 2005. It was phased out and replaced with the Sports Carnival.\n\nSports Day was a day of athletic competition, with individual events traditionally being the 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, shot put and the long jump. Team events were 4 × 100 m relays and 4 × 400 m relays.\n\nStudents were grouped into Houses (Yellow, Blue, Red and Green) and competed for points for the Houses. Competition would be tough, with each house claiming superiority over the other. Within the short periods of time, the houses each managed to form rather distinct identities. Yellow House was well known for its cheering abilities, while Blue House would claim to have the best athletes, and thus the best in sports. This claim would however, be hotly contested by Red House, who would argue being the most rounded House (both in competing and cheering) and winning the Sports Day Championship in 2002.

{"id": "2178746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2178746", "title": "Karangahape Road", "text": "Karangahape Road\n\nKarangahape Road (commonly known as K' Road) is one of the main streets in the central business district (CBD) of Auckland, New Zealand. The massive expansion of motorways through the nearby inner city area – and subsequent flight of residents and retail into the suburbs from the 1960s onwards – turned it from one of Auckland's premier shopping streets into a marginal area with the reputation of a red light district. Now considered to be one of the cultural centres of Auckland, since the 1980s–1990s it has been undergoing a slow process of gentrification, and is now known for off-beat cafes and boutique shops.\n\nIt runs west–east along a ridge at the southern edge of the Auckland CBD, perpendicular to Queen Street, the city's main street. At its intersection with Ponsonby Road in the west, Karangahape Road becomes Great North Road, at its eastern end it connects to Grafton Bridge.\n\nKarangahape is a word from the Māori language. Before Europeans appeared Auckland was occupied by several Māori iwi each of whom apparently used the same name for the Karangahape Ridge but with slightly different meanings.\n\nThe original meaning and origin of the word is uncertain; there are several interpretations – ranging from \"winding ridge of human activity\" to \"calling on Hape\". Hape was a Māori chief (or mythical personage) of some importance living over on the Manukau Harbour in a place also called Karangahape. As the ridge was a walking route and was known as Te Ara o Karangahape – The Path of Karangahape – the name possibly indicates the route that was taken to visit him.\n\nUntil the mid 20th century Karangahape Road was the only street in central Auckland with a Māori name, undoubtedly due to its use as a thoroughfare in pre-European times. Its Māori name proved difficult for many European settlers to pronounce and as it was the only major thoroughfare in the central area demarcated as a \"road\" (as opposed to a street) during the 19th century it was apparently often referred to as \"The Road\".\n\nIn 1908 there was a movement to replace the long Māori name with something more urbane, European and modern. Although there were several public meetings and much discussion in the newspapers at the time, the city council was unmoved and the name survived. The topic re-emerged in 1913 but was again unsuccessful, probably because of the advent of the First World War. Just before the Royal Tour in 1953 there was another push to rename the road; this time as \"Elizabeth Street\" but again the original name survived. From the early 20th century it has become widely known as \"K Road\", even outside of Auckland.\n\nAs it was a travel route used by the pre-European Māori, Karangahape Road is an older thoroughfare than Queen Street, which was only developed by Europeans in the 1840s. The land was part of the parcel of 3000 acres sold by a local Māori to the government in 1841. The Karangahape ridge was the formal southern edge of Auckland City in the 19th century. In 1882 the ratepayers of Newton (along with Ponsonby and Grafton) voted to become part of Auckland City.\n\nFrom about 1900 to the early 1960s, K' Road was Auckland's busiest shopping street with a large range of clothing and shoe shops and several department stores. Most retail chain stores had branches here, often in preference to Queen Street. During the interwar period most of Auckland's main shops selling furniture, musical instruments, radios and household appliances were located here.\n\nIn 1908 the gas street lighting was replaced with electric lamps. In 1935 the whole street was lit by electric lights under the shop awnings to create a \"Community Lighting\" project referred to as the \"Great White Way\". Activated by the Mayor Sir Ernest Davis this created a mile of lit-up shop fronts which added to the glamour of late night shopping. In 1948 the second set of traffic lights in Auckland (and the first lights to have pedestrian phases) were installed at the Pitt Street intersection. In 1949 the street lamps were fitted with the first fluorescent street lights in New Zealand.\n\nThe Karangahape Road Business Association (KBA) had begun in 1911 as an informal gathering of business people in the area. It officially dates from 1924 when it was registered as the Karangahape Road Businessmen's Association. Its first president was Mathew James Bennett, who ran a paint, wallpaper and interior decorating firm. Bennett was involved in a number of organisations including the Auckland Electric Power Board.\n\nDuring the middle of the 20th century the Karangahape Road Area was a destination shopping centre, especially busy on late nights when family groups would travel in (often on public transport) and clog the pavements. A line was painted down the centre of the footpaths to regulate foot traffic and police were posted at the Pitt Street intersection to stop people being pushed out into the traffic. A typical late-night outing included seeing a movie, shopping, a meal and promenading along the street window shopping and being seen. At this time the street had five cinemas (The Avon, Vogue, Newton Palace, Playhouse and Tivoli) and probably as many dance halls (The Music Academy, Peter Pan Cabaret) including the Druid's Hall in Galatos Street which is still in operation as a music venue.\n\nK Road was the location of many shops aimed at the beauty and fashion trade; fabric, clothing, shoes, accessories and many specialist hair and beauty salons (Kay's Beauty Salon, Winter's Hair Dressing, Miss Hubber, The Powder Puff Salon). There were several photographers' studios located along the ridge since the late Victorian period (Ellerbeck, Andrews, Morton's, Partington, Tadema, Sarony, St John Biggs, Peter Pan Studios). In addition to a collection of some fairly upmarket dress emporiums (Flacksons, LaGonda) and furriers, there were a number of establishments which specialised in bridal fashions and accessories (Tadema Studios was just one of the photographers which specialised in Wedding photography).\n\nAs shops were not open on Saturdays or Sundays before the 1980s, the inner city was rather quiet during the day on the weekends. Karangahape Road was an exception, however. Most weddings take place on a Saturday and groups of women would loiter on K road outside the many photographers' studios to catch a glimpse of wedding parties as they arrived or departed from having their studio portraits taken. Sundays were a social event as well; up until the 1960s people attending church dressed up and there was interest in what people, especially women, were wearing.\n\nThe Karangahape Road area was the location of several major churches; The Baptist Tabernacle, The Pitt St Methodist Church, St James' Wellington Street, Congregationalist, St Benedicts, The Church of Christ Scientist, The Church of Christ, The Church of the Epiphany, Church of Jesus, Church of the Latter Day Saints, Chinese Presbyterian Church, the Salvation Army, Pacific Island Church, two Brethren Halls and after 1966, the main Synagogue. There was also the Higher Thought Temple, The Theosophical Society, The Foresters Hall, The Druids Hall, The Scots Hall, The Hibernian Society, The Irish Hall, three Freemasons Halls, several Trade Unions, the Maori Hall and the Old Folks Association. Any of these organisations were likely to be the location of a service, lecture or social event on any given day.\n\nAfter 1965, K' Road lost most of its local customer base when construction of the inner-city motorway system resulted in over 50,000 people having to move out of the surrounding areas. The downturn in trade led to many shops closing and the relocating of businesses to other areas of Auckland. This accelerated the decline, and by the early 1970s the low rents in the western portion of the street meant it had acquired a rather seedy reputation as Auckland's red-light district although the adult industry never accounted for more than 4 percent of the businesses in the area at any time.\n\nSince the early 1990s there has been a move away from this image largely due to newly constructed apartment blocks attracting residents back to the area, as well as a general gentrification of close by areas such as Ponsonby. Karangahape Road is probably the most notorious street in the country, as most people imagine it is lined with strip clubs, brothels and adult shops. The reality is different; despite the street's earlier reputation very few enterprises are connected with the adult industry; for example there are 150 shops along the main road, K Road, and only 8 of them are connected with the sex industry. This proportion of outre establishments to more ordinary businesses has remained fairly constant for almost 40 years.\n\nK Road currently boasts an eclectic collection of shops, cafés and a nucleus of dealer art galleries. Since the early 1990s it has developed as a focus for nightlife; its restaurants, bars and nightclubs make it a major part of Auckland's social scene. This is largely due to redevelopment of the Queen Street valley in the 1980s as increased rents made many nightclub venues relocate to the K Road ridge. Since the mid 1990s K Road has become a centre for much of Auckland's bohemian scene, with many venues for alternative music and fringe art as well as the LGBT community. It is also known for its trendy op shops, and craft and art collectives.\n\nThe street received a major upgrade of its footpaths and street furniture which finished in 2006, at a cost of NZ$3.5 million. As of 2009, approximately 400 businesses were on K Road.\n\nIn 2011 the Karangahape Road overbridge had a $2.1 million upgrade as part of the Rugby World Cup Celebration. Designed by Opus Architecture and funded by Auckland Transport, it took 6 weeks to complete. Included in the design were three internally lit perspex pylons which act as entry markers for the bridge designed by the renowned Tongan artist Filipe Tohi.\n\nPopular guided heritage walks are conducted on Karangahape Road. Notable buildings and sites include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarangahape Road was the location of two of the earliest radio stations in the country; \nIn 1923 Charles Pearson obtained a license for the first radio station in Auckland. Initially called 1YB this station was renamed 1ZB in 1931. Its frequency was 1090AM. Pearson's morning announcer was a young woman called Maud Basham who later became famous as Aunt Daisy.\n\nThe first broadcasting house in Auckland, The Radio Broadcasting Company of New Zealand, operated from 1925 to 1931 on France Street with large radio antennae on top of the George Courts building. It ran a commercial radio station with the call sign 1YA and the frequency 910AM until it was absorbed into the Government Broadcasting System as part of National Radio in the 1930s.\n\nK Road has recently re-emerged as a film and audiovisual precinct. It has six independent film-makers and three screening venues. It was also the home of now defunct independent television station Alt TV.\n\nTwo radio stations, K FM Radio and Boosh.FM, operate from the street. K FM Radio broadcasts on the frequency 106.9 to most of the Auckland central business district and some of the inner-city suburbs. It plays reggae, dub, lounge, jazz, blues, funk and hip-hop in an attempt to reflect the diverse and alternative culture of Karangahape Road. Originally broadcasting from St.Kevin's Arcade, it is now based at 208 Karangahape Road.\n\nThe offices of Women in Film and Television (WIFT) are located at 1 Beresford Square.\n\nThe Auckland office of the New Zealand Film Archive is located in 300 Karangahape Road, where the institute has a reference library and exhibition space.\n\nThe song \"Verona\" by New Zealand rock band Elemeno P, from their album \"Love & Disrespect\", refers to the café/restaurant/bar of the same name at 169 Karangahape Road. The current Verona building dates from 1923 and takes its name from the Victorian house that previously occupied the site, Mrs Bishop's \"Verona\" Boarding House.\n\nGeddes Dental Renovations was a dental firm located in the K Road area on Queen Street. The company's radio jingle (broadcast from 1949 until the early 1980s) became a defining part of Auckland's culture; it was said it was possible to ascertain the presence of Aucklanders \"anywhere\" in the world by singing the Geddes' song.\n\nSung to the tune 'My Darling Clementine'\n\n\"Broke my denture, broke my denture. Woe is me, what shall I do?\"\n\n\"Take it in to Mr. Geddes, and he'll fix it just like NEW.\"\n\n\"What's the address, what's the address? Hurry please, and tell me DO!\"\n\n\"Top of Queen Street, on the corner, and the number's Four – Nine – TWO.\"\n\nArguably New Zealand's most famous commercial even though it hasn't been broadcast since the early 1980s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4G_Ne8YjR0\n\n\nA surprising number of nationally known shops and brand names started on Karangahape Road or had a branch there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2178786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2178786", "title": "Laumontite", "text": "Laumontite\n\nLaumontite is a mineral, one of the zeolite group. Its molecular formula is ()·4HO, a hydrated calcium-aluminium silicate. Potassium or sodium may substitute for the calcium but only in very small amounts.\n\nIt is monoclinic, space group C2/m. It forms prismatic crystals with a diamond-shaped cross-section and an angled termination. When pure, the color is colorless or white. Impurities may color it orange, brownish, gray, yellowish, pink, or reddish. It has perfect cleavage on [010] and [110] and its fracture is conchoidal. It is very brittle. The Mohs scale hardness is 3.5-4. It has a vitreous luster and a white streak.\nIt is found in hydrothermal deposits left in calcareous rocks, often formed as a result of secondary mineralization. Host rock types include basalt, andesite, metamorphic rocks and granites.\n\nThe identification of laumontite goes back to the early days of mineralogy. It was first named lomonite by R. Jameson (System of Mineralogy) in 1805, and laumonite by René Just Haüy in 1809. The current name was given by K.C. von Leonhard (Handbuch der Oryktognosie) in 1821. It is named after Gillet de Laumont who collected samples from lead mines in Huelgoat, Brittany, making them the type locality.\n\nLaumontite easily dehydrates when stored in a low humidity environment. When freshly collected, if it has not already been exposed to the environment, it can be translucent or transparent. Over a period of hours to days the loss of water turns it opaque white. In the past, this variety has been called leonhardite, though this is not a valid mineral species. The dehydrated laumontite is very friable, often falling into a powder at the slightest touch.\n\nIt is a common mineral, found worldwide. It can be locally abundant, forming seams and veins. It is frequently associated with other zeolites, including stilbite and heulandite. Notable occurrences are India; Paterson, New Jersey; Pine Creek, California; Iceland; Scotland; and the Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia. Prehnite pseudomorphs after laumontite (epimorphs) have been found in India.\n\n\n"}

The latter two are now connected by a bridge over the shallow 137-meter-wide Āsaga Strait. The islands are located some east of Tutuila and are a part of American Samoa, an unincorporated territory of the United States; their area is with a population of 1,400. Tau is the biggest island with its , and harbors the highest point of the Manua at .\n\nPolitically, the islands form the Manu'a District, one of the three administrative divisions of American Samoa.\n\nAll three islands are high islands: volcanic remnants rising out of the sea 14° south of the equator. The islands are elevated and mountainous. In contrast to most places in the world, the population of these islands has been decreasing steadily for decades. In the 1930s some 20% of the population of American Samoa lived in the Manua Islands. By the 1980s, only 6% were located there. Emigration is the consequence of a lack of economic opportunities and a desire of young people to participate in the more modern lifestyle offered on Tutuila (Office of Tourism, 2005). All the land of Manua is owned communally by Samoan families of Manua. This includes the National Parks lands which are only leased to the US National Parks system for 50 years.\n\nSamoan oral historical traditions state that Manu'a was a ruling center of a large Polynesian empire which included all of the Samoan archipelago, and other nearby islands such as Tonga and Fiji. The traditional capital of Manua is the village of Taū, on the island of Taū. The Manua Group is now part of the US Protectorate of American Samoa. Samoa aligned its interests with the U.S. in a Deed of Succession, signed by the \"Tui Manua\" (supreme chief of Manua) on July 16, 1904 at the Crown residence of the Tuimanua called the \"Faleula\" in the place called Lalopua (from Official documents of the Tuimanua government, 1893; Office of the Governor, 2004).\n\nCession followed the Tripartite Convention of 1899 that partitioned the eastern islands of Samoa (including Tutuila and the Manua Group) from the western islands of Samoa (including Upolu and Savaii).\n\nIn 1903, Manu'a had a total population of approximately 2,000 residents.\n\nThe Manu'a Hurricane of 1915 is particularly notable of two reasons. It was the first time the U.S. Congress voted to send financial aid to American Samoa, and it was the first time the American Red Cross made a donation to American Samoa.\n\nThe history of Manua is said in Samoan oratory to contain the origins of Samoan and Polynesian culture, and the genealogy of Polynesians east of Samoa is said to have originated in Manua. In traditional belief the sun rises over Samoa at Saua on the island of Taū, where the coral reef is supposed to be always yellow from the sun, and it sets at Falealupo the western-most village on the island of Savaii in Samoa. This journey of the sun is strongly related to traditional beliefs and defines \"Samoa Sasae\" and \"Samoa Sisifo\". The term Fa'asamoa describes \"The Samoan Way\", or traditional Samoan way of life\n\nThe sovereign of Manua was called the \"Tui Manua\". The last \"Tui Manua\" was Tuimanua Elisara (or Tui Manua Elisala) of the early 20th century. Tuimanua Elisara died on July 2, 1909. The title \"Tui Manua\" technically still exists although there is no titleholder; Tuimanua Elisara desired before his death that the title die with him. It was the U.S. government position at the time that his title changed to District Governor upon the hoisting of the U.S. flag at Taū on June 5, 1900 (Office of the Governor. 2004). However, titles and holdings were not obliterated when the islands became a U.S. territory, and the title and estates of Tuimanua remain under the custody of the \"Anoalo\" clan (male side of the Tuimanua line).\n\nToday, many families of Manua rely on income from family members working in Tutuila and in the United States. The local diet is generally healthier than in Tutuila, with less reliance on imported American and New Zealand tinned foods, and a greater reliance on local fishing and farming.\n\nThe people of Manua speak the Samoan language and utilize the \"t\".\n\nThe high school on Taū, called Manua High School, serves all of Manua. Most students seeking higher education go to American Samoa Community College in Tutuila or National University of Samoa on Upolu, or as far away as the University of Hawaii and elsewhere.\n\n\n"}

The left subclavian vein plays a key role in the absorption of fats and lipids, by allowing products that have been carried by lymph to enter the bloodstream, where it can enter the hepatic portal vein. The diameter of the subclavian veins is approximately 1–2 cm, depending on the individual.\n\nEach subclavian vein is a continuation of the axillary vein and runs from the outer border of the first rib to the medial border of anterior scalene muscle. From here it joins with the internal jugular vein to form the brachiocephalic vein (also known as \"innominate vein\"). The angle of union is termed the venous angle.\n\nThe subclavian vein follows the subclavian artery and is separated from the subclavian artery by the insertion of anterior scalene. Thus, the subclavian vein lies anterior to the anterior scalene while the subclavian artery lies posterior to the anterior scalene (and anterior to the middle scalene).\n\nThe thoracic duct drains into the left subclavian vein, near its junction with the left internal jugular vein. It carries lymph (water and solutes) from the lymphatic system, as well as chylomicrons or chyle, formed in the intestines from dietary fat and lipids, allowing these to enter the bloodstream; the products of fats and lipids can then be carried by the bloodstream to the hepatic portal vein, and then finally to the liver, making it so that the left subclavian vein plays a key role in the absorption of these fats and lipids.\n\nThe right lymphatic duct drains its lymph into the junction of the right internal jugular vein, and the right subclavian vein.\n\nAs the subclavian vein is large, central and relatively superficial, it is often used to place central venous lines.\n\n\"Sub\" (below), and \"clavian\" (pertaining to the clavicle).\n\nPaget–Schroetter disease includes the thrombosis of the subclavian veins, in this case usually caused by exercise-induced strains.\n\n"}

It is the principal agency responsible for meteorological observations, weather forecasting and seismology. IMD is headquartered in Delhi and operates hundreds of observation stations across India and Antarctica. Regional offices are at Mumbai, Kolkata, Nagpur and Pune.\n\nIMD is also one of the six Regional Specialised Meteorological Centres of the World Meteorological Organization. It has the responsibility for forecasting, naming and distribution of warnings for tropical cyclones in the Northern Indian Ocean region, including the Malacca Straits, the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf.\n\nIn 1686, Edmond Halley published his treatise on the Indian summer monsoon, which he attributed to a seasonal reversal of winds due to the differential heating of the Asian land mass and the Indian Ocean. The first meteorological observatories were established in India by the British East India Company. These included the Calcutta Observatory in 1785, the Madras Observatory in 1796 and the Colaba Observatory in 1826. Several other observatories were established in India during the first half of the 19th century by various provincial governments.\n\nThe Asiatic Society, founding in Calcutta in 1784 and in Bombay in 1804, promoted the study of meteorology in India. Henry Piddington published almost 40 papers dealing with tropical storms from Calcutta between 1835 and 1855 in \"The Journal of the Asiatic Society\". He also coined the term \"cyclone\", meaning the coil of a snake. In 1842, he published his landmark thesis, \"Laws of the Storms\".\n\nAfter a tropical cyclone hit Calcutta in 1864, and the subsequent famines in 1866 and 1871 due to the failure of the monsoons, it was decided to organise the collection and analysis of meteorological observations under one roof. As a result, the India Meteorology Department was established in 1875. Henry Francis Blanford was appointed the first Meteorological Reporter of the IMD. In May 1889, Sir John Eliot was appointed the first \"Director General of Observatories\" in the erstwhile capital, Calcutta. The IMD headquarters were later shifted to Shimla in 1905, then to Pune in 1928 and finally to New Delhi in 1944.\n\nIMD became a member of the World Meteorological Organization after independence on 27 April 1949. The agency has gained in prominence due to the significance of the monsoon rains on Indian agriculture. It plays a vital role in preparing the annual monsoon forecast, as well as in tracking the progress of the monsoon across India every season.\n\nIMD is headed by the \"Director General of Meteorology\", currently Dr. Mrutyunjay Mohapatra. IMD has six \"Regional Meteorological Centre\"s, each under a Deputy Director General. These are located in Chennai, Guwahati, Kolkata, Mumbai, Nagpur and New Delhi. There are also \"Meteorological Centres\" in every state capital. Other IMD units such as Forecasting Offices, Agrometeorological Advisory Service Centers, Hydro-meteorological Office, Flood Meteorological Offices, Area Cyclone Warning Centers and Cyclone Warning Centers are usually co-located with various observatories or meteorological center.\n\nIMD operates a network of hundreds of surface and glacial observatories, Upper Air (high altitude) stations, ozone and radiation observatories and meteorological radar stations. Additional data is received from India's constellation of satellites, such as Kalpana-1, Megha-Tropiques and instruments on board the IRS series and the INSAT series of satellites. Data and observations are also reported into the IMD network from meteorological instruments on board Indian merchant marine and Indian Navy ships. IMD was the first organisation in India to deploy a message switching computer for supporting its global data exchange.\n\nIMD collaborates with other agencies such as the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting and the National Institute of Ocean Technology.\n\nIMD also operates seismic monitoring centres at key locations for earthquake monitoring and measurements.\nThe new public website of IMD is https://mausam.imd.gov.in/\n\nIMD undertakes observations, communications, forecasting and weather services. In collaboration with the Indian Space Research Organisation, the IMD also uses the IRS series and the Indian National Satellite System (INSAT) for weather monitoring of the Indian subcontinent. IMD was first weather bureau of a developing country to develop and maintain its own satellite system.\n\nIMD is one of the six worldwide Regional Specialised Meteorological Centres of the Tropical Cyclone Programme of the World Weather Watch of the World Meteorological Organization. It is regional nodal agency for forecasting, naming and disseminating warnings about tropical cyclone in the Indian Ocean north of the Equator.\n\nThe IMD launched System of Aerosol Monitoring and Research (SAMAR) in January 2016 to study the concentration of Black carbon, radiative properties of aerosols, environmental visibility and their climatological impacts. It would contain a network of 16 aethalometers, 12 sky radiometers and 12 nephelometers.\n"}

While interviewing Amott, Gossow gave him a demo that she described as a \"poor quality\" video of a performance at a club. After firing Liiva in 2000, the band called in Gossow for an audition. Amott later said that \"she wiped the floor with all the other contenders.\" She then proceeded to record \"Wages of Sin\" with Arch Enemy.\n\nOn the eve of a 2002 tour, Gossow was diagnosed with nodules, which almost stopped her from growling. However, after some vocal therapy, she was able to recover her voice and she proceeded to begin taking piano and screaming lessons from renowned coach Melissa Cross. She continues to work in close conjunction with her.\n\nOn 17 March 2014, it was announced that Gossow was stepping down as Arch Enemy vocalist in order to pursue other interests and spend more time with her family. Gossow chose Alissa White-Gluz from Canadian metal band The Agonist as her replacement, and will remain business manager for the band.\n\nIn addition to managing Arch Enemy, Gossow also manages the bands Spiritual Beggars, Amaranthe and Obscura. She performed guest vocals on Amaranthe's 2020 single, \"Do Or Die\", and was featured in the song's music video, making it Gossow's first musical performance in 8 years.\n\nGossow provides the voice for the recurring character Lavona Succuboso in the animated television show \"Metalocalypse\". According to an interview with Musiikki TV at the Frostbite Festival 2009, Gossow did guest vocals on the Astarte album \"Demonized\", on the song \"Black at Heart\".\n\nGossow features on Melissa Cross's 2nd DVD release The Zen of Screaming 2 released by Melissa Cross. Apart from being on the cover pages of many leading magazines, she was also voted the \"best singer\" and \"shining star\" at the \"Burrn!\" magazine awards in 2002. Since 2008 she has been the manager for Spiritual Beggars.\n\nGossow recently expressed interest in starting a new extreme metal project in 2018 after Arch Enemy’s touring cycle for Will to Power, stating \"Yes, I want to make a new extreme metal project, but this will happen after Arch Enemy and work with Alissa [White-Gluz] will be concluded and the whole world will sail in calmer waters. I suppose this will be in 2018, when we concluded the first series of tours and all the rest. I will do so when the time comes.\"\n\nAngela Gossow has been outspoken and about her views, generally reflecting them in the lyrics of her songs. She is an atheist and politically considers herself a liberal-green anarchist, but votes \"to make sure the right-wing doesn't get her vote.\" Gossow is a vegan for health, ethical and environmental reasons. She vapes cannabis and credits it for a significant improvement in her asthma, and has supported its legalisation. Gossow is a teetotaler and non-smoker.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The ship was completed just before the start of World War I in August 1914. Even though \"France\" was not officially completed, she ferried the President of France to Russia during the July Crisis for consultations. She spent the war providing cover for the Otranto Barrage that blockaded the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the Adriatic Sea and sometimes served as a flagship. After the war \"France\" and her sister ship participated in the occupation of Constantinople and were then sent to the Black Sea in 1919 to support Allied troops in the Southern Russia Intervention. The war-weary crews of both ships briefly mutinied, but it was easily put down and she returned to France mid-year. Striking an uncharted rock off the French coast in 1922, she foundered four hours later.\n\nBy 1909, the French Navy was finally convinced of the superiority of the all-big-gun battleship like over the mixed-calibre designs like the which had preceded the \"Courbet\"s. The following year, the new Minister of the Navy, Augustin Boué de Lapeyrère, selected a design that was comparable to the foreign dreadnoughts then under construction as part of the 1906 Naval Programme. The ships were long overall and had a beam of and a mean draught of . They displaced at normal load and at deep load. Their crew numbered 1,115 men as a private ship and increased to 1,187 when serving as a flagship. The ships were powered by two licence-built Parsons steam turbine sets, each driving two propeller shafts, using 24 Belleville boilers to provide steam for her turbines. These boilers were coal-burning with auxiliary oil sprayers and were designed to produce . The ships had a designed speed of . The \"Courbet\"-class ships carried enough coal and fuel oil to give them a range at a speed of .\n\nThe main battery of the \"Courbet\" class consisted of twelve Canon de Mle 1906–1910 guns mounted in six twin-gun turrets, with two pairs of superfiring turrets fore and aft of the superstructure, and a pair of wing turrets amidships. Their secondary armament was twenty-two Canon de Mle 1910 guns, which were mounted in casemates in the hull. Four Canon de Mle 1902 Hotchkiss guns were fitted, two on each broadside in the superstructure. They were also armed with four submerged torpedo tubes and could stow 10 mines below decks. The ships' waterline belt ranged in thickness from and was thickest amidships. The gun turrets were protected by 250 mm of armour and plates protected the casemates. The curved armoured deck was thick on the flat and on the outer slopes. The conning tower had thick face and sides.\n\n\"France\", the seventh ship of her name to serve in the French Navy, was ordered on 1 August 1911 from Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire. The ship was laid down on 30 November at its shipyard in Saint-Nazaire and launched on 7 November 1912. She was formally declared completed on 1 July 1914 to carry President Raymond Poincaré, on a state visit to Saint Petersburg, Russia. He boarded the ship on 16 July. Escorted by \"Jean Bart\", \"France\" arrived at Kronstadt on 20 July after encountering the battlecruisers of the German I Scouting Group in the Baltic Sea en route. The French ships made a port visit to Stockholm, Sweden, on 25–26 July, but a planned visit to Copenhagen, Denmark, was cancelled due to rising tensions between Austria-Hungary and Serbia; they arrived at Dunkerque on 29 July.\n\nWhen France declared war on Germany on 3 August, the sisters were in Brest and departed for Toulon that night. They were met off Valencia, Spain, on the 6th by their sister and the semi-dreadnoughts and because \"Jean Bart\" was having problems with her 305 mm ammunition and \"France\" had yet to load any. The ships rendezvoused with a troop convoy the following day and escorted it to Toulon. \"France\" entered service on 10 October and was assigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron () of the 1st Naval Army () on 21 October at the mouth of the Adriatic Sea to prevent the Austro-Hungarian fleet from attempting to break out of the Adriatic. The torpedoing of \"Jean Bart\" on 21 December by the Austro-Hungarian submarine showed that the battleships were vulnerable to this threat and they were withdrawn to spend the rest of the month further south at an anchorage in Navarino Bay.\nOn 11 January 1915, the French were alerted that the Austro-Hungarian fleet was going to sortie from its base at Pola, so \"France\" and her sisters \"Courbet\" and \"Paris\" led the 1st Naval Army north to the Albanian coast. It proved to be a false alarm, and they were back at their moorings three days later. In the meantime, the ships patrolled the Ionian Sea as the danger of submarine attacks in the restricted waters of the Strait forced the battleships south. The declaration of war on Austria-Hungary by Italy on 23 May and the Italian decision to assume responsibility for naval operations in the Adriatic, allowed the French Navy to withdraw to either Malta or Bizerte, French Tunisia, to cover the Otranto Barrage. A fire broke out aboard \"France\" on 25 July and she was forced to return to Toulon for repairs that lasted until 14 October. Two days later Vice-Admiral () Louis Dartige du Fournet assumed command of the 1st Naval Army and hoisted his flag aboard \"France\", which remained in Malta for the rest of the year. At some point during the year, the ship's 47 mm guns were put on high-angle mountings to allow them to be used as anti-aircraft (AA) guns. They were later supplemented by a pair of Mle 1891 G guns on anti-aircraft mounts.\n\nOn 27 April 1916, the French began using the port of Argostoli on the Greek island of Cephalonia as a base. Dartige du Fornet transferred his flag to the battleship on 23 May. Around this time, many men from the battleships' crews were transferred to anti-submarine ships. At the beginning of 1917, the French began to use the Greek island of Corfu as well, but growing shortages of coal severely limited the battleships' ability to go to sea. The situation was so bad that Vice-Admiral Gabriel Darrieus wrote in 1917: The military capabilities of the , which has already been badly affected by the shortages of personnel and constant changes in the general staff, need to be maintained by frequent exercises, and although from March to June we were able to follow a normal pattern, the coal crisis is currently preventing any manoeuvres or gunnery training, even for the ships returning from repairs. The big ships have lost 50 per cent of the capability they had several months ago. In 1918, they were almost immobile, leaving Corfu only for maintenance and repairs. On 1 July, the 1st Naval Army was reorganised with \"France\" assigned to the 1st Battle Division () of the 1st Battle Squadron ().\n\nAfter the Armistice of Mudros was signed on 30 October between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire, the ship participated in the occupation of Constantinople. In early 1919, \"France\", flagship of Vice-Admiral Jean-Françoise-Charles Amet, and \"Jean Bart\" were transferred to the Black Sea to reinforce the French forces opposing the Bolsheviks. A few days after bombarding Bolshevik troops advancing on Sevastopol on 16 April and forcing them to retreat, \"France\"s war-weary crew briefly mutinied on 19 April, inspired by socialist and revolutionary sympathisers. Unlike \"Jean Bart\"s captain, who had managed to quell the mutiny aboard his ship by the following day, \"France\"s crew was still mutinous and Amet hoped to reduce tensions by meeting the mutineers' demands for leave and letting crewmen with a history of good behaviour ashore. The sailors mingled with a pro-Bolshevik demonstration and the mixed group was challenged by a company of Greek infantry, which opened fire. The demonstrators fled and encountered a landing party from \"Jean Bart\", which also fired upon them. A total of about 15 people were wounded, included six sailors, one of whom later died of his wounds. Delegates from the other mutinous crews were not allowed aboard and the mutiny collapsed when Amet agreed to meet their main demand to take the ships home. \"France\" was the first to depart on 23 April, but the ship sailed to Bizerte before continuing onwards to Toulon. Twenty-six crewmen were sentenced to prison terms upon her return, although the sentences were commuted in 1922 as part of a bargain between Poincaré, now Prime Minister, and the parties of the left.\n\nOn 1 July, all the \"Courbet\"s were assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Squadron. On 10 February 1920, the 1st Naval Army was disbanded and replaced by the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron () and its Western counterpart (); all the sisters were assigned to the 1st Battle Squadron of the latter unit, with \"Courbet\", \"Jean Bart\" and \"Paris\" in the 1st Battle Division and \"France\" in the 2nd Battle Division, with Rear-Admiral () Louis-Hippolyte Violette commanding the latter from \"France\". The two squadrons were combined into the Mediterranean Squadron () on 20 July 1921.\n\n\"France\" and the battleship hosted the British battleship and light cruiser during a port visit to Villefranche from 18 February to 1 March 1922. The two French battleships had a gunnery exercise on 28 June using the former Austro-Hungarian battleship as a target and sank her. On 18 July, \"France\", \"Paris\" and \"Bretagne\" began a cruise visiting French ports in the Bay of Biscay and English Channel. On the evening of 25/26 August, \"France\" struck an uncharted rock while entering Quiberon Bay at 00:57. The after boiler room flooded quickly and the ship lost all power at 01:10. She had a 5° list by 02:00 and the order was given to abandon ship. The battleship capsized two hours later after \"Bretagne\" and \"Paris\" were able to rescue all but three of her crew. Her wreck was slowly broken up in place in 1935, 1952 and 1958.\n\n"}

{"id": "2178874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2178874", "title": "Leadhillite", "text": "Leadhillite\n\nLeadhillite is a lead sulfate carbonate hydroxide mineral, often associated with anglesite. It has the formula PbSO(CO)(OH). Leadhillite crystallises in the monoclinic system, but develops pseudo-hexagonal forms due to crystal twinning. It forms transparent to translucent variably coloured crystals with an adamantine lustre. It is quite soft with a Mohs hardness of 2.5 and a relatively high specific gravity of 6.26 to 6.55.\n\nIt was discovered in 1832 in the Susannah Mine, Leadhills in the county of Lanarkshire, Scotland. It is trimorphous with susannite and macphersonite (these three minerals have the same formula, but different structures). Leadhillite is monoclinic, susannite is trigonal and macphersonite is orthorhombic. Leadhillite was named in 1832 after the locality.\n\nLeadhillite belongs to the monoclinic crystal class 2/m, which is the class with the highest symmetry in the monoclinic system. It has a two-fold axis of symmetry perpendicular to a mirror plane, and the general form is an open-ended prism. The space group is P2/a, meaning that the two-fold axis is a screw axis and the mirror plane is a glide plane.\nThere are 8 formula units per unit cell (Z = 8) and the angle β is very nearly equal to 90°. The side-lengths of the unit cell are a = 9.11 Å, b = 20.82 Å and c = 11.59 Å.\n\nLeadhillite has a layered structure. The mineral contains both carbonate and sulfate groups, and these are arranged in separate sheets. Pairs of carbonate sheets 8(PbCO) alternate with pairs of sulfate sheets 8[Pb(SO)OH]. The carbonate sheets virtually have trigonal symmetry, but the sulfate sheets do not. All the lead (Pb) atoms in the carbonate sheets are surrounded by 9 oxygens from carbonate groups and by one hydroxyl from an adjacent sulfate sheet. The Pb atoms in the sulfate sheets are bonded to 9 or 10 oxygens.\n\nCrystals are usually small to microscopic, and nearly always pseudo-hexagonal, being tabular with a hexagonal outline. Prismatic forms also occur. The simplest form with faces parallel to the b axis and cutting the a and c axes (represented as {101}) may develop. When it does it may be striated or curved. The colour is white or pale shades of green, blue or yellow, but the commonest is clear to white. Leadhillite is transparent to translucent, with a white streak and a resinous to adamantine lustre, pearly on faces parallel to the plane containing the a and b axes. Tabular forms of susannite are very similar.\n\nLeadhillite is biaxial (-) with the optical Z axis parallel to the crystallographic b axis, and the optical X axis inclined to the crystallographic c axis at an angle of -5.5°.\nThe refractive indices are large, giving the mineral its high lustre, n = 1.87, n = 2.00 and n = 2.01. Compare these values with that for ordinary window glass, which is only 1.5. The refractive index depends upon the direction of travel of light through the crystal. The maximum birefringence δ is the difference between the highest and the lowest values. For leadhillite δ = 0.140.\nAn important characteristic of a biaxial material is the angle between the two optic axes, called the optic angle and designated 2V. It is possible to calculate this value from the refractive indices, and also to measure it. For leadhillite both the measured and calculated values of 2V are 10°. \nWhen the colour of the incident light is changed the refractive indices change, and so does the value of 2V. This effect is known as dispersion of the optic axes. In leadhillite this effect is strong, with 2V smaller for red light than for violet light (r < v). The mineral may fluoresce yellowish longwave or shortwave ultraviolet light.\n\nLeadhillite is a soft mineral, with hardness only to 3, a little less than that of calcite. It breaks with an irregular to conchoidal fracture and it is somewhat sectile. That is, thin shavings can be pared off it. It is heavy, due to the lead content, with specific gravity 6.55, similar to other lead minerals such as cerussite (6.5) and anglesite (6.3).\nCleavage is perfect on a plane perpendicular to the c crystal axis. \nThe mineral is usually twinned, according to a variety of twin laws, forming contact, penetration and lamellar twins. The typical habit is platy or tabular pseudohexagonal cyclic twinned crystals. \nLeadhillite is soluble with effervescence in nitric acid HNO, leaving lead sulfate.\n\nThe type locality is the Susanna Mine at Leadhills, Strathclyde, Scotland, UK.\nLeadhillite is a secondary mineral found in the oxidised zone of lead deposits associated with cerussite, anglesite, lanarkite, caledonite, linarite and pyromorphite. It may form pseudomorphs after galena or calcite, and conversely calcite and cerussite may form pseudomorphs after leadhillite. Heating leadhillite causes it to reversibly transform into susannite.\n"}

This corresponds to a representation of the molecular wave function where the variables corresponding to the molecular geometry and the electronic degrees of freedom are separated. The non separable terms are due to the nuclear kinetic energy terms in the molecular Hamiltonian and are said to couple the potential energy surfaces. In the neighbourhood of an avoided crossing or conical intersection, these terms cannot be neglected. One therefore usually performs one unitary transformation from the adiabatic representation to the so-called diabatic representation in which the nuclear kinetic energy operator is diagonal. In this representation, the coupling is due to the electronic energy and is a scalar quantity which is significantly easier to estimate numerically.\n\nIn the diabatic representation, the potential energy surfaces are smoother, so that low order Taylor series expansions of the surface capture much of the complexity of the original system. However strictly diabatic states do not exist in the general case. Hence, diabatic potentials generated from transforming multiple electronic energy surfaces together are generally not exact. These can be called pseudo-diabatic potentials, but generally the term is not used unless it is necessary to highlight this subtlety. Hence, pseudo-diabatic potentials are synonymous with diabatic potentials.\n\nThe motivation to calculate diabatic potentials often occurs when the Born–Oppenheimer approximation does not hold, or is not justified for the molecular system under study. For these systems, it is necessary to go \"beyond\" the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. This is often the terminology used to refer to the study of nonadiabatic systems.\n\nA well known approach involves recasting the molecular Schrödinger equation into a set of coupled eigenvalue equations. This is achieved by expansion of the exact wave function in terms of products of electronic and nuclear wave functions (adiabatic states) followed by integration over the electronic coordinates. The coupled operator equations thus obtained depend on nuclear coordinates only. Off-diagonal elements in these equations are nuclear kinetic energy terms. A diabatic transformation of the adiabatic states replaces these off-diagonal kinetic energy terms by potential energy terms. Sometimes, this is called the \"adiabatic-to-diabatic transformation\", abbreviated ADT.\nIn order to introduce the diabatic transformation we assume now, for the sake of argument, that only two Potential Energy Surfaces (PES), 1 and 2, approach each other and that all other surfaces are well separated; the argument can be generalized to more surfaces. Let the collection of electronic coordinates be indicated by formula_1, while formula_2 indicates dependence on nuclear coordinates. Thus, we assume formula_3 with corresponding orthonormal electronic eigenstates\nformula_4 and formula_5. \nIn the absence of magnetic interactions these electronic states, which depend parametrically on the nuclear coordinates, may be taken to be real-valued functions.\n\nThe nuclear kinetic energy is a sum over nuclei \"A\" with mass \"M\",\n(Atomic units are used here).\nBy applying the Leibniz rule for differentiation, the matrix elements of formula_7 are (where we suppress coordinates for clarity reasons):\nThe subscript formula_9 indicates that the integration inside the bracket is \nover electronic coordinates only.\nLet us further assume\nthat all off-diagonal matrix elements\nformula_10 may be neglected except for \"k = 1\" and\n\"p = 2\". Upon making the expansion\nthe coupled Schrödinger equations for the nuclear part take the form (see the article Born–Oppenheimer approximation)\n\nIn order to remove the problematic off-diagonal kinetic energy terms, we\ndefine two new orthonormal states by a diabatic transformation of the adiabatic states formula_13 and formula_14\nwhere formula_16 is the diabatic angle. Transformation of the matrix of nuclear momentum formula_17 for formula_18 gives for \"diagonal\" matrix elements\nThese elements are zero because formula_20 is real\nand formula_21 is Hermitian and pure-imaginary.\nThe off-diagonal elements of the momentum operator satisfy,\n\nAssume that a diabatic angle formula_16 exists, such that to a good approximation\n\ni.e., formula_25 and formula_26 diagonalize the 2 x 2 matrix of the nuclear momentum. By the definition of\nSmith formula_25 and formula_26 are diabatic states. (Smith was the first to define this concept; earlier the term \"diabatic\" was used somewhat loosely by Lichten ).\n\nBy a small change of notation these differential equations for formula_16 can be rewritten in the following more familiar form:\nIt is well known that the differential equations have a solution (i.e., the \"potential\" \"V\" exists) if and only if the vector field (\"force\")\nformula_31 is irrotational, \nIt can be shown that these conditions are rarely ever satisfied, so that a strictly diabatic\ntransformation rarely ever exists. It is common to use approximate functions formula_16 leading to \"pseudo diabatic states\".\n\nUnder the assumption that the momentum operators are represented exactly by 2 x 2 matrices, which is consistent with neglect of off-diagonal elements other than the (1,2) element and\nthe assumption of \"strict\" diabaticity, \nit can be shown that\n\nOn the basis of the diabatic states\nthe nuclear motion problem takes the following \"generalized Born–Oppenheimer\" form\n\nIt is important to note that the off-diagonal elements depend on the diabatic angle and electronic energies only. The surfaces formula_36 and formula_37 are adiabatic PESs obtained from clamped nuclei electronic structure calculations and formula_38 is the usual nuclear kinetic energy operator defined above.\nFinding approximations for formula_16 is the remaining problem before a solution of the Schrödinger equations can be attempted. Much of the current research in quantum chemistry is devoted to this determination. Once formula_16 has been found and the coupled equations have been solved, the final vibronic wave function in the diabatic approximation is\nHere, in contrast to previous treatments, the non-Abelian case is considered.\n\nFelix Smith in his article considers the adiabatic-to-diabatic transformation (ADT) for a multi-state system but a single coordinate, formula_42. In Diabatic, the ADT is defined for a system of two coordinates formula_42 and formula_44, but it is restricted to two states. Such a system is defined as Abelian and the ADT matrix is expressed in terms of an angle, formula_45 (see Comment below), known also as the ADT angle. In the present treatment a system is assumed that is made up of \"M\" (> 2) states defined for an \"N\"-dimensional configuration space, where \"N\" = 2 or \"N\" > 2. Such a system is defined as non-Abelian. \nTo discuss the non-Abelian case the equation for the just mentioned ADT angle, formula_45 (see Diabatic), is replaced by an equation for the MxM, ADT matrix, formula_47:\n\nwhere formula_49 is the force-matrix operator, introduced in Diabatic, also known as the Non-Adiabatic Coupling Transformation (NACT) matrix:\n\nHere formula_51 is the \"N\"-dimensional (nuclear) grad-operator:\n\nand formula_53,are the electronic adiabatic eigenfunctions which depend explicitly on the electronic coordinates formula_54 and parametrically on the nuclear coordinates formula_55.\n\nTo derive the matrix formula_56 one has to solve the above given first order differential equation along a specified contour formula_57. This solution is then applied to form the diabatic potential matrix formula_58:\n\nwhere formula_60 ; \"j\" = 1, \"M\" are the Born–Oppenheimer adiabatic potentials. In order for formula_58 to be single-valued in configuration space, formula_56 has to be analytic and in order for formula_56 to be analytic (excluding the pathological points), the components of the vector matrix, formula_49, have to satisfy the following equation:\n\nwhere formula_66 is a tensor field. This equation is known as the non-Abelian form of the Curl Equation. \nA solution of the ADT matrix formula_47 along the contour formula_68 can be shown to be of the form:\n\n(see also Geometric phase). Here formula_71 is an ordering operator, the dot stands for a scalar product and formula_72 and formula_73 are two points on formula_68.\n\nA different type of solutions is based on quasi-Euler angles according to which any formula_47-matrix can be expressed as a product of Euler matrices. For instance in case of a tri-state system this matrix can be presented as a product of three such matrices, formula_76 (\"i\" < \"j\" = 2, 3) where e.g. formula_77 is of the form:\n\nThe product formula_79 which can be written in any order, is substituted in Eq. (1) to yield three first order differential equations for the three formula_80-angles where two of these equations are coupled and the third stands on its own. Thus, assuming: formula_81 the two coupled equations for formula_82 and formula_83 are:\n\nwhereas the third equation (for formula_86) becomes an ordinary (line) integral:\n\nexpressed solely in terms of formula_88 and formula_89.\n\nSimilarly, in case of a four-state system formula_47 is presented as a product of six 4 x 4 Euler matrices (for the six quasi-Euler angles) and the relevant six differential equations form one set of three coupled equations, whereas the other three become, as before, ordinary line integrals.\nSince the treatment of the two-state case as presented in Diabatic raised numerous doubts we consider it here as a special case of the Non-Abelian case just discussed.\nFor this purpose we assume the 2 × 2 ADT matrix formula_91 to be of the form:\n\nSubstituting this matrix in the above given first order differential equation (for formula_91) we get, following a few algebraic rearrangements, that the angle formula_45 fulfills the corresponding first order differential equation as well as the subsequent line integral:\n\nwhere formula_96 is the relevant NACT matrix element, the dot stands for a scalar product and formula_68 is a chosen contour in configuration space (usually a planar one) along which the integration is performed.\nThe line integral yields meaningful results if and only if the corresponding (previously derived) Curl-equation is zero for every point in the region of interest (ignoring the pathological points).\n"}

It was released simultaneously in single and double CD/cassette formats on October 26, 1993, by Sire Records, then DVD format on January 24, 2006. The single CD is an abridged version of the double CD edition, featuring tracks 2, 13–16, 5, 6, 9, 18, and 20–23 in that order. There are no different takes of songs across the multiple editions although the actual track times differ by a few seconds between releases.\n\nIn late 1992, the Velvet Underground 1965–1968 core line-up of Lou Reed, John Cale, Sterling Morrison and Maureen Tucker suddenly decided to reform. The decision was entirely unexpected because the relationship between Reed and Cale had been sour ever since the late 60s, and though it had ameliorated after back catalogue royalty renegotiations in the mid-80s, it had hit another low after their 1990 collaboration \"Songs for Drella\".\n\nNevertheless, an impromptu one-song reunion in Jouy-en-Josas, France, later that year for an Andy Warhol exhibition set the scene and by 1993, the band had started to rehearse for European and American tours. Lou Reed's then-current record company, Sire Records, agreed to release a live album from the European tour, and ambitious plans were made for both an \"MTV Unplugged\" appearance with accompanying album and a subsequent studio album.\n\nTwo key people did not participate in the reunion: sometime singer Nico, who had died in 1988; and latter-day vocalist/bassist/keyboard player Doug Yule, who Sterling Morrison would have liked to participate but who was vetoed out by Reed and Cale. Yule later stated that, although he would have liked being considered at least, he would have declined anyway because of family priorities.\n\nThe album was recorded during a three-night residence in the Paris venue L'Olympia. John Cale later said, \"During the second night we hit the home run\", and it is of this night that most of the \"Live MCMXCIII\" tracks were taken. The rest were taken from the third night.\n\n\"Live MCMXCIII\" captures the band playing most of the Velvet classics from the back catalogue, with emphasis on the more structured songs. While they mainly stuck with their classics, there were two major improvisations on the European tour. \"Some Kinda Love\" was extended considerably to 9:06, with Cale improvising on piano, and Reed playing lengthy guitar solos throughout. The other improvisation on the tour was on \"Hey Mr. Rain\", where Cale and Reed solo \"against\" each other on viola and guitar, respectively, for 15:42. The band also performed two new songs: \"Velvet Nursery Rhyme\", a short tongue-in-cheek reunion theme song where Reed introduces the members of the band, and \"Coyote\", a Reed/Cale collaboration. Emphasis is on the band's first and third records and the \"lost fourth album\" (see \"VU\" and \"Another View\"), with only two songs from \"Loaded\".\nDuring the six-week European tour, relationships quickly soured again and by the end of the tour all other plans were off, never to rematerialise. The band's latest breakup proved final when Sterling Morrison died in the summer of 1995.\n\nThe Velvets' reunion itself met with critical praise from the mainstream rock press, and generated heavy publicity for the band (resulting in the six-week European tour having many sold out venues or near capacity), but the album received mixed reviews. The public and the critics were split into two camps: those who did not want to spoil their vision of the band from the 60s and those who wanted to see the legendary four back together on stage and find out whether they could still be relevant. Reviews reflected the views of the two camps.\n\nAfter its release, Cale expressed disappointment in the album's mix: \"The trouble is that we had an opportunity here with the live album to really show what the band sounded like and it really doesn't give it to you. Some of the bootlegs that came out of the tour are almost a truer vision of what the band sounded like than the well recorded one, because the well recorded one really didn't take advantage of the ambiance of the room in the mix of the music. And that's what we were always pushing at. We wanted to fill the room up with this noise. Unfortunately it wasn't quite as present in the mix as I would have liked it to be or others would have liked it to be either.\"\n\nAll tracks written by Lou Reed except as noted.\n\n\n\nAlbum Design-Spencer Drate,Judith Salavetz,Sylvia Reed\nPhotography-Ted Chin\n\n"}

It was established in 1949 to revolutionise the processing and marketing of dairy products in the city.\n\nAarey Milk Colony at Goregaon (East) was established in 1949 and in 1951 the dairy at Aarey was inaugurated by the then Prime Minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nThe colony was the vision of Mr Dara Khurody, a pioneer of dairy sector who shared the '1963 Ramon Magsaysay Award' with Dr Verghese Kurien for revolutionizing the processing and marketing of milk in Mumbai.\nAarey Milk Colony includes 12 villages: Sai, Gundgav, Film City, Royal Palms, Dindoshi (Eksar Pahad), Aarey, Pahadi Goregaon, Vyraval, Kondivita, Maroshi (Marol), Parjapur, and Paspoli. In 1977, around of land was carved out from Aarey village to establish Film City. The colony is spread over and is located off the Western Express Highway (WEH). Among the popular attractions in Aarey are Chhota Kashmir with a lake and a picnic spot.\n\nThe colony also has gardens, a nursery, lakes, an observation pavilion, picnic facilities, and milk plants. 16,000 cattle are reared on of land, and 32 cattle farms. The management of all these is outsourced to a private firm every two years. Film City is frequently used for movie shoots.\n\nThere is a road within the colony built by the Maharashtra Public Works Department that connects the WEH to Powai. The Aarey Colony administration earlier collected toll from the users of the road. In 2014, the MCGM took over the road and ended the collection of the toll. It is also the location of the proposed carshed and depot for Line 3 of the Mumbai Metro.\n\nA plan was mooted in 2010 to extend the existing Byculla Zoo in South Mumbai by building a zoo with no enclosures on land that would be acquired from both the colony as well as the adjacent Sanjay Gandhi National Park.\n\nAarey Forest has an array of wild life and several species of insects, butterflies and birds. It has at least 86 species of trees and 22 species of birds. A recent report submitted to the state highlights the rich biodiversity inside Aarey. There are about 290 species of wild life in Aarey Forest including 5 such species of animals which feature in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). These vulnerable animals include leopards, Rusty spotted cat, Sambar deer, Alexandrine Parakeet and Red-wattled Lapwing. \n\nAarey is known to have potential to show human-leopard co-existence in an urban setting. There are 4 adult females named Adarsh Nagar (after the locality she used to frequent), Bindu, Chandani and Luna. The leopards are monitored by camera traps, first set up in 2015. The Forest Department has joined hands with citizen groups to observe and learn about leopard behaviour. An RTI has revealed that from 2016-2018, seven leopards have been rescued. While Aarey has been infamous for leopard attacks, research by Centre for Wildlife Studies revealed that leopards are actually afraid of humans and highlighted that poor garbage disposal and newly released leopards in a new environment have caused attacks. Vidya Athreya, an ecologist, pointed out that leopards being around was never a big issue among residents of these areas, it is only a recent demand. She also pointed out that this is an urban dwellers' issue as people in rural areas experience less attacks and no death has occurred in Ahemadnagar, for instance, despite having a higher leopard count.\n\nAarey has been an unexplored and understudied area. Environmental researchers found two new jumping spiders in 2017 - Langelurillus onyx and Langelurillus lacteus.\n\nThere are around 27 tribal hamlets (known as \"padas\" in Marathi) and other smaller hamlets in Aarey. Some of tribes that the original inhabitants belong to are Katkaris, Mahadev Kolis, Mallar Kolis and Warlis The tribals in the area farm and cultivate various fruits and vegetables among other which are then sold in markets for a livelihood. They have suffered on account of basic amenities not provided by the government and also the rapid degradation of the forest and drive to displace tribals has impacted their sustainable lifestyle and means of livelihood. \nThe Aarey Milk Colony occupies a total area of of land, out of which the area available for cultivation of quality fodder and grasses is only. Land is also leased out to various organizations and institutions of the Maharashtra State Government and Central Government of India. Allocation of land is as follows:\n\n\nThe main objective to erect such colony:\n\nIn the colony, 30 stables are constructed having a capacity for housing 500–550 animals in each stables. Each stable has been provided with an ancillary building such as hay gawdown, chaff-cutting sheds, calving lines, and residential accommodation for the cattle owner and their staff. The private cattle owner who are maintaining their herds in the Mumbai city prior to 1949 were shifted and allotted licences to maintain their buffaloes in the colony stables. Presently, Aarey Milk Colony has got the capacity of accommodating 16,079 cattle in 30 units. The licence holders are required to pay the necessary license fee, occupation charges, water and electricity charges and other ancillary services rendered to them.\n\nIn addition to the activities of maintaining the large herds of milch animals in Aarey Colony, certain activities like running primary school for the benefit of children of residents of the Aarey Colony and running 24 bed hospital are also undertaken by Aarey authorities.\n\n\nUnder this scheme, nearly 1,700 indigenous and cross-breed cows are maintained at four Dairy Farms Units. The indigenous herd is utilized for producing large numbers of cross-breed heifers which are supplied to the farmers of dairy co-operatives in Maharashtra state to augment the milk production and the generation of cross-breed herd will be utilized to study the effect of cross-breeding up to 7.5% and 6.5% exotic blood level. This study will be useful to advise the farmers in the Maharashtra state regarding the breeding policies that can be practiced by them for breeding their cross-bred progeny at the village level. Maintenance of cross-breed herds will be economic while the indigenous herds will be showing some amount of losses, but it will be a good study for future planning.\n\nIn order to increase the revenue and decrease the losses incurred, the following activities were initiated from 2001–02.\n\nThe various activities are carried out by the staff of around 640 personnel under the administrative control of Chief Executive Officer, Aarey Colony.\n\nThe roads within Aarey are lonely and late night travel must be avoided between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. The thick vegetation hides wild animals like leopards, who usually prey upon stray dogs and feral pigs. In recent years, increased human encroachment into leopard territory and shortage of prey density in the neighbouring SGNP have turned some leopards into man-eaters. On 22 December 2016, the headless body of a 22-year-old man, Brandon Gonsalves, was found near Unit 2 of Aarey Colony. The Mumbai Police suspected that it was a case of human sacrifice performed by some \"tantrik\" babas. Apart from criminal activities like murders, road robberies, and occult practices, there are apocryphal tales of ghosts trying to hitch rides.\n\nA large portion of Bimal Roy's \"Madhumati\" (1958) was shot in the area, to match the earlier footage shot in Nainital.\n\n"}
{"id": "2178938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2178938", "title": "French house", "text": "French house\n\nFrench house, also known as French touch, filter house and tekfunk, is a style of house music originally produced by French musicians in the 1990s. It was a popular strand of the late 1990s and 2000s European dance music scene and a form of Euro disco. The genre has also been referred to as over the years. The defining characteristics of the sound are heavy reliance on filter and phaser effects both on and alongside samples from late 1970s and early 1980s American or European disco tracks (or original hooks strongly inspired by such samples), causing thicker harmonic foundations than the genre's descendants. Most tracks in this vein feature steady beats with a tempo range of 110–130 beats per minute. French house tends to be confused with a genre known as future funk, although they are not the same genre. Purveyors of French house include Daft Punk, Cassius, the Supermen Lovers, Modjo, Étienne de Crécy, Fred Falke, and Alan Braxe.\n\nFrench house is greatly influenced by the lineage of American dance music from the emergence of disco onwards, maintaining a distinct connection to Euro disco and the short lived space disco music style. Space disco was very popular in France, with artists like Cerrone, Space and Sheila B. Devotion during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Additional influences came from P-Funk, especially the George Clinton and Bootsy Collins hits of that era. Due to originating from the same foreign market, P-Funk was played alongside disco in many French discothèques, especially after the Disco Demolition Night took place in the United States. The Jacking aspect of Chicago house was also picked up on as a theme to incorporate (with \"jack house\" becoming a short-lived descriptive term for the sound in the UK). Furthermore, the influence of musical French figures of the seventies as François de Roubaix, Jean-Michel Jarre or Serge Gainsbourg was also critical. An early example of French house could be \"Dance\" released in 1990 by Earth People.\n\nThomas Bangalter's tracks for his Roulé label may be considered the earliest examples of an attempt to establish a distinctive style of French house. His solo material, along with his work as a member of Daft Punk and Stardust, had a significant impact upon the French house scene during the mid-to-late 1990s. The French duo Motorbass (Philippe Zdar, later of Cassius, and Étienne de Crécy) were also among the first in France to produce house tracks which were largely based around samples and filtered loops – in turn inspired by emerging American house producers such as DJ Sneak, Green Velvet and Roger Sanchez and their penchant for producing sample-led house tracks with deep funky grooves – and released a sole full-length album, \"Pansoul\". Parisian producer St. Germain produced house tracks with a similar style at the time but these were more directly influenced by jazz as opposed to the brasher vocal disco records appropriated, while other known French DJ-turned-producers at the time such as François Kevorkian and Laurent Garnier remained relatively distant from the emerging French house label.\n\nThe first French house experiments were warmly received by the UK dance music press and European DJ's in the mid-1990s but major commercial success did not occur until 1997. Daft Punk, Cassius and, later, Stardust were the first internationally successful artists of the genre. Along with Air these acts were signed to Virgin Records and benefited from distinctive music videos directed by the likes of Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry and Alex & Martin. Due to a reasonable amount of buzz generated from the huge clubbing scene and major record company support, Daft Punk's debut album \"Homework\" entered the top 10 of the UK album charts on release and they effectively became the biggest-selling French act in the UK since Jean-Michel Jarre. The emergence of the French sound was well-timed as dance music's popularity in the influential UK market was peaking commercially with general electronic music.\n\nFurther international commercial success continued into 2000 with Bob Sinclar, Étienne de Crécy, Benjamin Diamond and Modjo achieving hit singles around Europe. In late 2005, pop superstar Madonna released \"Confessions on a Dance Floor\", an album with significant French house influences in several of its songs.\n\nAs of the mid to late-2010s, there is a resurgence in interest in French house, with material being released from artists such as Folamour and Mirrorball Disco Squad from Paris, as well as Tiger and Woods from Italy. This sound is also being championed on the lo-fi house scene by the likes of Mall Grab and Loods.\n\nThe term \"French touch\" was first used in Paris in July 1987. Jean-Claude Lagrèze, a photographer of parisians' nights created a couple of \"French Touch\" parties at The Palace to make people discover house music. These parties were driven by DJ Laurent Garnier, Guillaume la Tortue and David Guetta. This expression was printed, as part of a motto for French partygoers who liked house music, on a trendy jacket by Éric Morand for Fnac Music Dance Division, in 1991. The motto was: \"We Give a French Touch to House\". British music journalists used the expression and contributed to the diffusion of this movement.\n\nThe first time this term was used widespreadly by MTV UK during the Christmas holiday period of 1999. It was used on an MTV News special, to describe a so-called \"French house explosion\" phenomenon. Bob Sinclar was interviewed, as well as Air (a non-house act) and Cassius. This news special later aired on all the MTV local variations worldwide, spreading the term and introducing the \"French house\" sound to the mainstream.\n\nPrior to that (1996–2000), \"French house\" had been referred to among Europeans as \"nu disco\", \"disco house\" and \"new disco\". However, the term \"French touch\" was first used by music journalist Martin James in his 1996 review of the first Super Discount EP in the now defunct weekly music paper \"Melody Maker\". This term became favoured among the French media and was then widely used in the UK press by 1998. Martin James was later recognised by French newspaper Liberation and Radio NRJ as the journalist responsible for naming the French house phenomenon \"French touch\".\n\nOne of the biggest markets for nu disco at the time was Greece, especially Athens. A local music shop called Discobole Records imported the records direct from France and middle class clubs like City Groove dedicated totally to the genre between 1998 and 2001. In Greece, this music style was promoted as \"disco house\". At the same time, disco house began to gain success in Canada. During 1999 many events also took place on Spain's Ibiza island, a very popular destination for British tourists.\n\nFrench house is essentially a combination of three production styles. One is what the French still refer as \"the French touch\" and it is the style that greatly influenced by the space disco sound. The second is a continuation and update of Euro disco and greatly influenced by the productions of Alec R. Costandinos. The third would be the deep American house style as evident in the similar treatment of samples and repetitive 'funky' hooks. Naturally, further variations and mutations followed. French house maintains the established \"French touch\" sound, focused more on Euro disco-like vocals and less emphasis on the \"space disco\" themes. However, most of the music's most successful acts have altered their sound since. Bob Sinclar's later work, including the hit single \"World, Hold On (Children of the Sky)\", which had a video based on a science fiction theme, maintains only a distant connection to the original French house sound. Both Daft Punk and Etienne de Crecy subsequently developed a harder synthetic sound more directly inspired by techno, electro and pop.\n\nIn Ibiza, disco house took later another direction: it combined vocals and some elements from the UK's speed garage (a mid 1990s music style) with a local Latin flavor. By 2007, many underground disco house productions belonged to the Ibiza school.\n"}

In the vicinity of conical intersections, the Born–Oppenheimer approximation breaks down and the coupling between electronic and nuclear motion becomes important, allowing non-adiabatic processes to take place. The location and characterization of conical intersections are therefore essential to the understanding of a wide range of important phenomena governed by non-adiabatic events, such as photoisomerization, photosynthesis, vision and the photostability of DNA.\n\nConical intersections are also called molecular funnels or diabolic points as they have become an established paradigm for understanding reaction mechanisms in photochemistry as important as transitions states in thermal chemistry. This comes from the very important role they play in non-radiative de-excitation transitions from excited electronic states to the ground electronic state of molecules. For example, the stability of DNA with respect to the UV irradiation is due to such conical intersection. The molecular wave packet excited to some electronic excited state by the UV photon follows the slope of the potential energy surface and reaches the conical intersection from above. At this point the very large vibronic coupling induces a non-radiative transition (surface-hopping) which leads the molecule back to its electronic ground state.The singularity of vibronic coupling at conical intersections is responsible for the existence of Geometric phase, which was discovered by Longuet-Higgins in this context.\n\nDegenerate points between potential energy surfaces lie in what is called the intersection or seam space with a dimensionality of 3N-8 (where N is the number of atoms). Any critical points in this space of degeneracy are characterised as minima, transition states or higher-order saddle points and can be connected to each other through the analogue of an intrinsic reaction coordinate in the seam. In benzene, for example, there is a recurrent connectivity pattern where permutationally isomeric seam segments are connected by intersections of a higher symmetry point group. The remaining two dimensions that lift the energetic degeneracy of the system are known as the branching space.\n\nConical intersections are ubiquitous in both trivial and non-trivial chemical systems. In an ideal system of two dimensionalities, this can occur at one molecular geometry. If the potential energy surfaces are plotted as functions of the two coordinates, they form a cone centered at the degeneracy point. This is shown in the adjacent picture, where the upper and lower potential energy surfaces are plotted in different colors. The name conical intersection comes from this observation.\n\nIn diatomic molecules, the number of vibrational degrees of freedom is 1. Without the necessary two dimensions required to form the cone shape, conical intersections cannot exist in these molecules. Instead, the potential energy curves experience avoided crossings.\n\nIn molecules with three or more atoms, the number of degrees of freedom for molecular vibrations is at least 3. In these systems, when spin-orbit interaction is ignored, the degeneracy of conical intersection is lifted through first order by displacements in a two dimensional subspace of the nuclear coordinate space.\n\nThe two-dimensional degeneracy lifting subspace is referred to as the branching space or branching plane. This space is spanned by two vectors, the difference of energy gradient vectors of the two intersecting electronic states (the \"g vector\"), and the non-adiabatic coupling vector between these two states (the \"h vector\"). Because the electronic states are degenerate, the wave functions of the two electronic states are subject to an arbitrary rotation. Therefore, the \"g\" and \"h\" vectors are also subject to a related arbitrary rotation, despite the fact that the space spanned by the two vectors is invariant. To enable a consistent representation of the branching space, the set of wave functions that makes the \"g\" and \"h\" vectors orthogonal is usually chosen. This choice is unique up to the signs and switchings of the two vectors, and allows these two vectors to have proper symmetry when the molecular geometry is symmetric.\n\nThe degeneracy is preserved through first order by differential displacements that are perpendicular to the branching space. The space of non-degeneracy-lifting displacements, which is the orthogonal complement of the branching space, is termed the seam space. Movement within the seam space will take the molecule from one point of conical intersection to an adjacent point of conical intersection.\n\nFor an open shell molecule, when spin-orbit interaction is added to the, the dimensionality of seam space is reduced.\n\nThe presence of conical intersections is difficult to detect experimentally. Only recently it has been proposed that two-dimensional spectroscopy can be used to detect their presence through the modulation of the frequency of the vibrational coupling mode.\n\nConical intersections can occur between electronic states with the same or different point group symmetry, with the same or different spin symmetry. When restricted to a non-relativistic Coulomb Hamiltonian, conical intersections can be classified as symmetry-required, accidental symmetry-allowed, or accidental same-symmetry, according to the symmetry of the intersecting states.\n\nA symmetry-required conical intersection is an intersection between two electronic states carrying the same multidimensional irreducible representation. For example, intersections between a pair of E states at a geometry that has a non-abelian group symmetry(e.g. C(3h), C(3v) or D(3h)). It is named symmetry-required because these electronic states will always be degenerate as long as the symmetry is present. Symmetry-required intersections are often associated with Jahn-Teller effect.\n\nAn accidental symmetry-allowed conical intersection is an intersection between two electronic states that carry different point group symmetry. It is called accidental because the states may or may not be degenerate when the symmetry is present. Movement along one of the dimensions along which the degeneracy is lifted, the direction of the difference of the energy gradients of the two electronic states, will preserve the symmetry while displacements along the other degeneracy lifting dimension, the direction of the non-adiabatic couplings, will break the symmetry of the molecule. Thus, by enforcing the symmetry of the molecule, the degeneracy lifting effect caused by inter-state couplings is prevented. Therefore, the search for a symmetry-allowed intersection becomes a one-dimensional problem and does not require knowledge of the non-adiabatic couplings, significantly simplifying the effort. As a result, all the conical intersections found through quantum mechanical calculations during the early years of quantum chemistry were symmetry-allowed intersections.\n\nAn accidental same-symmetry conical intersection is an intersection between two electronic states that carry the same point group symmetry. While this type of intersection was traditionally more difficult to locate, a number of efficient searching algorithms and methods to compute non-adiabatic couplings have emerged in the past decade. It is now understood that same-symmetry intersections play as important a role in non-adiabatic processes as symmetry-allowed intersections.\n\n\n"}

They have garnered acclaim for their energetic and intense live shows. They announced on July 14, 2008 that they had left their label Ferret Music and signed with Epitaph Records instead. Their eighth and latest studio album \"Low Teens\" was released through Epitaph on September 23, 2016.\n\nThe band was established by Jordan Buckley, Andy Williams and Michael Novak. They added Keith Buckley on vocals and bassist John McCarthy. They played their first show in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\nIn their first short tour covering the Buffalo, New York and Toronto, Ontario, Canada vicinities, the band met Goodfellow Records producer Chris Logan, who released the band's debut EP \"Burial Plot Bidding War\" in 2000. The following year, Aaron Ratajczak replaced McCarthy as bassist and the band entered Zing Studios in Westfield, MA to begin recording their debut full length for Ferret Records in January of 2001. The band released Last Night In Town on August 14, 2001 and embarked on an east coast tour with Killswitch Engage in support. That same year Stephen Micciche, of Kid Gorgeous replaced Ratajczak as bassist.\n\nIn mid-December 2002, it was announced that the band had booked time to record their next album in February 2003, with the aim of releasing it in June. Recording took place at Trax East studios in South River, New Jersey with producer Eric Rachel. On February 13, 2003, it was announced that drums had been tracked and that progress on guitars was underway. The following March, the band embarked on tour with Unearth & Evergreen Terrace and shot a music video for the album's lead single, \"Ebolorama\" with director Darren Doane. The band released \"Hot Damn!\" on July 1, 2003 and embarked on an American tour supporting \"Jackass\" star Steve-O. The album was well received and brought about their first mini Warped Tour stint, overseas tours with NORA and Chimaira, numerous U.S tours with bands such as Bleeding Through, Norma Jean, Dillinger Escape Plan, and a spot on the 2004 Ozzfest tour. \n\nMicciche resigned from his position in 2005 to towards the end of the writing sessions for Gutter Phenomenon with the band announcing they were accepting online submissions to replace Micciche. Kevin Falk of Between The Buried and Me filled the vacant position in April of 2005. The band released Gutter Phenomenon on August 23rd, 2005 on Ferret Records with Falk being let go from the band almost immediately after the albums release for personal reasons. He was replaced by Chris Byrnes of NORA who left the band immediately following their stint on Warped Tour 2006 under amicable circumstances.He was replaced by Keller Harbin of The Chariot and embarked on tour with Atreyu on the World Championship Tour along with From First to Last and Chiodos. On October 30th, 2006, the band released their first DVD entitled \"Shit Happens\" including various home videos, tour antics and live footage of the band.\n\nIn February of 2007, Keith Buckley stated that the band had been holed up in a basement in North Tonawanda, New York writing their 4th album. On April 24th, 2007 the band announced that The Big Dirty would be released on September 4th of that year. The band embarked on tour with Norma Jean of June of 2007. The next month the band released the first single, \"Imitation Is the Sincerest Form of Battery\" on all streaming services. Upon release of the album, Josh Newton replaced Harbin on bass and the band embarked on tour with Underoath, Poison The Well & Maylene & The Sons Of Disaster. The band performed the song \"We'rewolf\" live on the ABC late night talk show \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" on Halloween of 2007. From January–February 2008, Every Time I Die went on a tour with Killswitch Engage, The Dillinger Escape Plan, and Parkway Drive. They also headlined the Take Action Tour, playing alongside From First to Last, August Burns Red, The Bled, and The Human Abstract. The band played the entire Warped Tour 2008. \n\nIn July of 2008, Keith Buckley announced that the band had fulfilled their contract with Ferret Records and were looking for a new label. In February of 2009 the band announced that they have signed with Epitaph Records and would be going into the studio later that year to begin production on their fifth album.\nDuring the 2009 UK tour with Gallows, a song titled \"Buffalo 666\" was played for the first time. At the end of June it was announced that drummer Mike \"Ratboy\" Novak had left the band due to \"personal conflicts\". On August 23 of that year, Ryan \"Legs\" Leger was added as the new drummer.

The band toured across Australia playing shows in Sydney, Gold Coast, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth.\n\nJosh Newton announced on October 12, 2011 that he was no longer in the band. For the remainder of the tour, Stephen Micciche filled his role as bassist. On December 12, they released a video on Warped Tour's YouTube channel announcing they were playing all dates on the 2012 Warped Tour.\n\nIn January 2012, Every Time I Die released their video for \"Underwater Bimbos from Outer Space\", from their album \"Ex Lives\", which was released on March 6, 2012. On February 23, the band released the second single and music video off the album for \"Revival Mode\". The band embarked on tour with The Devil Wears Prada, Oh, Sleeper and Letlive. in 2012 in support of Ex Lives. On October 15, 2013, the band was announced to be a support act for A Day to Remember on their European Tour 2014.\n\nIn the spring of 2014, the band announced that they were starting production on their seventh studio album \"From Parts Unknown\" with producer Kurt Ballou which was released July 8, 2014 along with their 6th run on the Vans Warped Tour 20th edition. The album peaked at #22 on the \"Billboard\" 200, their second top 25 in the band's existence. Following their time on Warped Tour Every Time I Die started a Canadian tour in mid September with Expire and Counterparts. Following their Canadian tour they co-headlined a winter tour with The Ghost Inside along with support from Architects, Backtrack and Hundredth as their openers.\n\nIn February 2015 the band announced Ryan Leger's departure to be replaced by Daniel Davison, formerly of Norma Jean and Underoath. On March 29, the band revealed that they would be releasing an EP exclusively for Record Store Day titled \"Salem\".\n\nIn December 2015 while on tour with August Burns Red, vocalist Keith Buckley left due to a life-threatening emergency with his 7-month pregnant wife and unborn daughter. It was during this time and the subsequent hospital stays that Buckley wrote a vast majority of lyrics for a new album while awaiting their clean bill of health and recovery. On September 23rd, 2016 the band released Low Teens to universal critical acclaim. . The band spent the next 2 years touring with the likes of Knocked Loose, Harm's Way, Fall Out Boy, Taking Back Sunday, '68, Motionless In White, Turnstile and Machine Gun Kelly in support of the album. In September 2017, Daniel Davison parted ways with the band citing exhaustion from touring. He was replaced by Clayton \"Goose\" Holyoak of Fear Before The March Of Flames and coincidentally from being a replacement for Davison once before in Norma Jean. Holyoak was subsequently replaced in Norma Jean by former ETID drummer Ryan Leger. On June 21st, 2018, the band embarked on the final run of the Vans Warped Tour. In October of 2018, the band announced that they will embark on one last tour in support of Low Teens with Turnstile, Angel Du$t and Vein before taking time off to begin writing their ninth record. On December 15th, 2018, the band was honored by their native Buffalo, for their musical accomplishments and advocacy for the city, with an annual holiday on December 15th named after the band. The band revealed in an interview they all have to share their ETID Day plaque between them\n\nOn September 9, 2019, the band confirmed that they had started work on their ninth album.\nThey later announced during the January 2020 UK/EU tour supporting While She Sleeps, that the recording process of the album would start once they returned to the US. The album is expected to be released later in 2020.\n\nEvery Time I Die's style has been described as metalcore, hardcore punk and post-hardcore. They initially formed as a hardcore band but their music soon manifested strong influences from heavy metal and rock. They have been called \"metalcore icons\" and their 2003 album \"Hot Damn!\" a \"total gamechanger\" for the genre. AllMusic described their metalcore sound as mixing alternative metal, Southern metal and screamo. They have also experimented with mathcore and sludge metal at various points in their discography. They are strongly influenced by Southern rock; frontman Keith Buckley stated that \"the grit of ... Southern rock bands is the one commonality that the band has. It's something we all appreciate and grew up on, in a sense; mainly because it was the type of music that made a coarse poetry out of nature.\" Just as the band's sound is chaotic, sharp and manifold, their lyrics are crafted to be strange, sarcastic and sardonic.\n\nCurrent\nFormer\nTouring musicians\nTimeline\n\n\n"}

He is the older brother of the late, great, Texas blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan.\n\nSeveral notable blues guitarists have had a significant influence on Vaughan's playing style including the \"Three Kings\" (Albert, Freddie, and B.B. King) and Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson.\n\nJimmie Lawrence Vaughan was born on March 20, 1951 in Dallas County, Texas, to parents, Jimmie Lee Vaughan and Martha Jean Cook. Raised in Dallas, Texas, Vaughan moved to Austin in the late 1960s and began playing with such musicians as Paul Ray and WC Clark.\n\nIn 1969, Vaughan's group opened for The Jimi Hendrix Experience in Fort Worth, Texas. It was at this show that Vaughan lent Jimi Hendrix his Vox Wah-wah pedal which Hendrix ended up breaking. In return, Hendrix gave Vaughan his own touring Wah-wah pedal.\n\nJimmie Vaughan developed his own easily recognized personal style. He formed the band The Fabulous Thunderbirds with the lead singer Lou Ann Barton and harpist Kim Wilson, bassist Keith Ferguson, and drummers Mike Buck and Fran Christina. (The original Fabulous Thunderbirds were all protégés of Austin, Texas blues club owner Clifford Antone). The band's first four albums, released between 1979 and 1983, are ranked among the most important 'white blues' recordings. These early albums did not sell well, so the band was left without a recording contract for a couple of years (during the time when Vaughan's younger brother achieved commercial success). During this time, Vaughan played lead guitar on fellow Texas blues musician Bill Carter's 1985 album, \"Stompin' Grounds\", also playing Carter's most well-known song, \"Willie The Wimp\", which would be introduced a year later to Stevie Ray Vaughan and played on live albums.\n\nThe Fabulous Thunderbirds got a new contract in 1986, and made several albums with a more commercially popular sound and production style. Vaughan left the band in 1990, and made his only \"duo album\", \"Family Style\", with his younger brother, Stevie Ray Vaughan. Before the album's release, Stevie Ray died in a helicopter crash along with three members of Eric Clapton's entourage in East Troy, Wisconsin, on August 27, 1990. The album was released a month after the accident. The artist listed on the album was \"The Vaughan Brothers\". The album was light, blues-influenced rock, with Jimmie Vaughan singing on several tracks.\n\nVaughan released his first solo album \"Strange Pleasure\" in 1994. The album contained a song \"Six Strings Down\" that was dedicated to the memory of his brother. He has continued his solo career since then. Vaughan's solo albums contain mostly blues-rock material that he writes himself. He made a special guest appearance on Bo Diddley's 1996 album \"A Man Amongst Men,\" playing guitar on the tracks \"He's Got A Key\" and \"Coatimundi\". In 2001, Vaughan paid an installment on his (and the Fabulous Thunderbirds') debt to harmonica swamp blues when he contributed guitar to the Lazy Lester album \"Blues Stop Knockin.' \"\n\nHe has a son, Tyrone Vaughan.\n\nSince 1997 Fender has produced a Jimmie Vaughan Tex-Mex Stratocaster.\n\nVaughan appeared in the 1998 released film \"Blues Brothers 2000\" as a member of the fictional \"Louisiana Gator Boys\" blues band led by BB King.\n\nVaughan is close friends with Dennis Quaid. They worked together on the film \"Great Balls of Fire\".\n\nVaughan was the third opening act for most of the dates of Bob Dylan's summer 2006 tour, preceded by Elana James and the Continental Two and Junior Brown.\n\nVaughan loves classic and custom cars, and is an avid car collector. Vaughan has had many of his customs and hot rods displayed in museums, as well as featured in rodding and custom magazines.\n\nVaughan continues to perform. He has also been politically active to some degree. He endorsed Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul in 2008 and played before one of Paul's speeches at the University of Texas. Vaughan also opened for Ron Paul's keynote address at the Rally for the Republic in St. Paul, Minnesota on September 2, 2008. Vaughan appeared with Boz Scaggs & The Blue Velvet Band at the 2009 Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Vaughan performed at Ron Paul's \"We are the Future\" rally in Tampa, Florida on August 26, 2012.\n\nShout! Factory released Jimmie Vaughan's first new album in nine years, \"Plays Blues, Ballads & Favorites\", on July 6, 2010.\n\nVaughan played with Eric Clapton, Robert Cray, BB King, Hubert Sumlin, and others during the 2010 Crossroads Guitar Festival.\n\nVaughan performed on the episode of the TBS cable television show \"Conan\", that aired December 22, 2010.\n\nVaughan performed at the 11th Edition of the Xerox Rochester International Jazz Festival on Friday, June 29, 2012.\n\nIn 2014, Vaughan performed at the Mahindra Blues Festival in India alongside the Tedeschi Trucks Band.\n\nVaughan performed guitar as a guest on an episode of the PBS cable television show \"Austin City Limits\", with the Foo Fighters, which aired on February 7, 2015. He and the Foo Fighters were accompanied on stage by another guest guitarist, Gary Clark, Jr., a native of Austin, Texas.\n\nHis 2019 recording, \"Baby, Please Come Home\", was chosen as a 'Favorite Blues Album' by AllMusic.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He switched in the spring of 1954 to being pianist and arranger for the quintet co-led by trumpeter Clifford Brown and drummer Max Roach. This band toured extensively across the U.S. for two years, and released both studio and concert recordings, including the Grammy Hall of Fame inductee \"Clifford Brown & Max Roach\".\n\nPowell, his wife, and Brown were killed in a car crash when traveling overnight from Philadelphia to Chicago. Powell was beginning to achieve recognition at the time of his death, but he never had the chance to record as a leader. He had a playful piano style, and was fond of using musical quotations. His relatively heavy touch and use of left-hand fourths influenced fellow pianist McCoy Tyner.\n\nPowell was born in New York City on September 5, 1931. He was the youngest of three sons, after William, Jr., and Bud, seven years Richie's elder. Their parents were William, Sr. and Pearl Powell. The family was musical: William, Sr. was a stride pianist; William, Jr. led bands as a trumpeter and violinist; and pianist Bud became one of the leaders of bebop.\n\nOne account of why Richie took up the piano is that he pestered drummer Max Roach, who lived nearby, for drum lessons, and Roach, eventually fed up, suggested that he play the piano instead. Bud did not assist his brother at all in his musical endeavors; instead, according to a biographer of saxophonist Jackie McLean, \"it was an excellent but now forgotten pianist named Bob Bunyan who taught Richie Powell chords on the piano. Richie would study with Bunyan, and then go home and watch his brother practice. [...] Richie and Jackie became tight friends and used to rehearse together\". Richie also studied music with Mary Lou Williams,\nand attended the City College of New York.\n\nFrom 1949 to 1951 Powell worked around Philadelphia and New York City. He then played in the bands of Paul Williams (1951–52) and Johnny Hodges (1952–54). With Williams' R&B-oriented band he recorded four tracks late in 1952 that were released as singles. Powell also played on a medley track for a 1954 Hodges album, \"Used to Be Duke\".\n\nPowell was with Hodges' band in Los Angeles in the spring of 1954 when Roach needed a new pianist for the quintet that he co-led with trumpeter Clifford Brown. Powell was offered, and accepted, the job. He also became arranger for the quintet. They performed and rehearsed a lot, then had several recording sessions that August for EmArcy Records, which resulted in their first album, \"Brown and Roach Incorporated\". In the same month, Powell was involved as pianist for some tracks at a session arranged for singer Dinah Washington that featured a studio audience. In September the quintet played for a fortnight at the Black Hawk in San Francisco, then began a tour of the eastern United States the following month. The band's saxophonist, Harold Land, reported that, when touring, \"Richie was a little busy with the ladies. He had harems in almost every city\".\n\nFurther recording sessions for Powell with Brown and Roach took place in New York during January and February 1955. The tracks cut in January, with arrangements by Neal Hefti, were released as \"Clifford Brown with Strings\". The February sessions yielded the albums \"Study in Brown\", and, combined with tracks from the previous year, \"Clifford Brown & Max Roach\". The latter was added to the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. At the Newport Jazz Festival in July 1955 Powell played with Roach and others as backing for Washington. Recordings made of the Brown–Roach quintet at the same event were released decades later.\n\nThe quintet with Sonny Rollins, who replaced Land on tenor saxophone, recorded what became their last official album early in 1956. \"Clifford Brown and Max Roach at Basin Street\" contained playing at even faster tempos than on their earlier album releases. Several of the tunes were composed by Powell; on one, \"Time\", Powell played celeste in addition to his usual piano. Another was \"Gertrude's Bounce\", which Powell said was named following his admiration for the way in which artist Gertrude Abercrombie walked. The third of his originals, \"Powell's Prances\", was \"a modal composition, with Brown and Rollins improvising on the scale rather than on the usual chord changes\", a form popularized three years later by Miles Davis.\n\nThe band continued touring in 1956, including to Toronto. In late February or early March, Powell and Rollins, traveling together near Philadelphia, were involved in a crash that destroyed Powell's car, but they were not seriously injured. The quintet recorded under the leadership of Rollins in March for Prestige; this was released as \"Sonny Rollins Plus 4\". They also had live national CBS Radio broadcasts from the Basin Street club in April and May. Two years of exposure with the Brown–Roach ensemble meant that Powell was beginning to achieve some recognition in his own right.\n\nOn June 26, 1956, Powell and his wife, Nancy, together with Brown, were traveling overnight by car from Philadelphia to Chicago. On the Pennsylvania Turnpike outside Bedford, in heavy rain, Nancy lost control of the vehicle, which crashed off the road and rolled down an embankment. All three were killed instantly. Nancy was 19; Brown, 25; and Powell, 24.\n\nAlthough he also played swing and R&B, Powell was known as a bebop player. This included using right-hand single-note lines. In his playing with Brown and Roach, he was fond of inserting musical quotes, including from nursery rhymes and opera.\n\nPowell usually played as part of a rhythm section in ensembles, so there are few recorded examples of him in smaller bands. In one 1954 session he recorded a trio version of \"I'll String Along with You\", on which he used \"heavily chorded patterns with intriguing flourishes.\" Another exception to Powell being in a supporting role is his extended introductory section to a 1954 Hodges recording of \"Autumn in New York\". On this track, in the words of critic Marc Myers six decades later, Powell's playing was \"regal, bouncy and appropriately lush, with shades of Erroll Garner, Al Haig and Richie's brother, Bud. [...] In 'Autumn in New York', we clearly hear a dramatic, playful pianist who was fast becoming an extraordinary talent.\"\n\nPianist McCoy Tyner, who grew up close to the Powell brothers in Philadelphia, was influenced by their relatively heavy keyboard touch and their liking of percussive piano sounds. Tyner also got some of his inspiration for chord voicings from hearing Richie's use of left-hand fourths. Tyner's voicings became the norm for young jazz pianists. When Harold Mabern was at the beginning of his career, he emulated the harmonies in Powell's comping.\n\nPowell did not make any recordings as a leader.<br>\nBootlegs and other unofficial recordings are not included.\n\nBibliography\n"}

It has its origins in a private venture by Dassault to produce an all-French aircraft which would make use of jet propulsion, which subsequently would receive orders from the French Air Force.\n\nThe Ouragan holds the distinction of being the first jet-powered French-designed combat aircraft to enter production, and thus played a key role in the resurgence of the French aviation industry following the Second World War. The Ouragan was operated by France, India, Israel and El Salvador. While in Israeli service, the type participated in both the Suez Crisis and the Six-Day War.\n\nAs a consequence of the nation being occupied by Germany during the majority of the Second World War, France had not been able to contribute significantly to the great strides that had been made in aircraft design during the conflict. In March 1945, aviation designer Marcel Bloch returned to France from captivity in the Buchenwald concentration camp and was eager to re-establish the aviation industry through the development and production of an all-French fighter, powered by newly developed jet propulsion technology. In particular, he was keen to develop the aircraft quickly enough to corner the emerging market for such an aircraft. In early 1946, Bloch renamed both himself and his new company \"Dassault\", after his brother's wartime codename in the French Resistance.\n\nIn 1947, following the bare-bones preparation of a factory and equipment, Dassault formally embarked on the development of this all-French fighter, which was solely at his own initiative at the start. According to aviation historian Kenneth Munson, Dassault's design drew more on American rather than British inspiration, having elected to use features such as a very thin wing akin to the Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star and a basic configuration comparable to the North American F-86 Sabre. Due to its interceptor role, an emphasis had been placed on a fast rate of climb. The aircraft was powered by a single Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine, which was already being licence-produced in France by Hispano-Suiza for the SNCASE SE-535, which was in turn a licence-built version of the British de Havilland Vampire.\n\nIn September 1947, a series of talks outlining the project took place between Dassault and the Bureau d'Etudes et Plans d'Etat Major. The French government's response to the proposal was positive; however no firm order for the aircraft was placed at this time, necessitating the project to proceed as a private venture. In December 1947, the detailed design work phase of the project, which had been allocated the design number \"M.D. (Marcel Dassault) 450\", commenced. On 7 April 1948, the construction of a prototype began at the company's factory in Saint-Cloud, Paris. On 29 June 1948, Dassault's decision to proceed was met with the issuing of contract No. 2223/48 from the Service Technique de l'Aéronautique of the Ministère des Armées \"Air\", which ordered the construction of three prototypes.\n\nThe rate of progress on the project was such that, within 15 months of design work having formally started, the first prototype, designated \"M.D.450-01\", had been fully constructed and had performed its maiden flight. On 28 February 1948, the first prototype of the \"Ouragan\" fighter conducted its first flight with Dassault Chief Test Pilot Kostia Rozanoff at the controls. This prototype lacked pressurization, armament, and the distinctive wingtip fuel tanks of subsequent production aircraft. It was powered by a Rolls-Royce Nene 102 centrifugal-flow engine capable of generating 22.27 kN (2,270 kp/5,000 lbf) of thrust. During service trials in 1949, the first prototype attained a top speed of 980 km/h (529 knots, 609 mph) and achieved an initial climb rate of 43 m/s (8,465 ft/min).\n\nIn May 1948, the second prototype, \"M.D.450-02\", made its maiden flight. This second prototype featured a pressurized cockpit and more complete internal equipment. In November 1948, the second prototype was dispatched to Centre d'Essais en Vol de Marignane to participate in manoeuvrability trials, during which it was recorded as having climbed to an altitude of 15,000 m (49,213 ft). In December 1948, the 450 liter (118.9 US gal) wingtip tanks that would become an indelible feature of all Ouragans first appeared. Testing of the second prototype was discontinued following the sustaining of damage during one landing due an undercarriage malfunction.\n\nThe completion of the third prototype was delayed to incorporate lessons learnt from the first two prototypes. On 2 June 1950, the third prototype, \"M.D.450-03\", conducted its first flight. This third prototype was powered by a Hispano-Suiza-licensed Nene 104, as envisaged for use on production aircraft. It was dispatched to Centre d'Essais en Vol de Cazaux to conduct weapons trials while armed with 15 mm and later 20 mm cannons.\n\nOn 31 August 1949, the French Air Force ordered 15 pre-production aircraft, which were later reduced to 12, in order to support the test program. The contract was signed on 15 December 1949. These pre-production aircraft saw extensive use in various flying trials and evaluations, including various engines, armament schemes, and equipment payloads, as well as to support other development programs. Amongst these aircraft, which were designated \"M.D.450-1\" through to \"M.D.450-12\", were several notable revisions; \"M.D.450-6\" was the first aircraft of the type to feature electrically-operated trim tabs, \"M.D.450-8\" (also known as \"M.D.450R\", was configured as an aerial reconnaissance aircraft, and \"M.D.450-10\", which was used as a flying testbed for the SNECMA Atar engine.\n\nAccording to Munson, around the time of the pre-production aircraft order, there had been considerations within the French Government for the procurement of up to 850 Ouragans under a five-year plan to recapitalise the French armed forces. On 31 August 1950, Dassault received an initial fixed order contract for 150 production Ouragans to equip the Armée de l'Air. In the following years, a further three orders, each ordering an additional 100 Ouragans, would be placed by the French government; however, the final of these additional orders would be cancelled in January 1952 in favour of an equivalent order for the newer and more advanced Dassault Mystère IIC.\n\nDassault's production facilities proved to be unable to attain the rate of production necessary to keep pace with the domestic orders, in part due to a lack of time to refine the Ouragan's design to make it easier to mass-produce; accordingly, portions of the work were subcontracted to other French aircraft manufacturers. A manufacturing arrangement was formed with SNCASE to assemble forward fuselages for the aircraft at their Toulouse factory, while a similar agreement with SNCASO led to the firm manufacturing rear fuselages at Saint-Nazaire and wings in Bouguenais. Dassault's factories continued to produce the center fuselage and tail units, while final assembly was carried out at Dassault's facility in Mérignac, Gironde.\n\nOn 5 December 1951, the first production Ouragan conducted its maiden flight. There was little difference between the pre-production and production aircraft, the most significant being alterations to the design of the doors enclosing the retractable nosewheel landing leg in response to accidents that occurred on the first two prototypes. By the end of 1952, a total of 39 production aircraft had been completed; a further 93 were manufactured in 1953, and the final 118 were finished by mid-1954.\n\nA handful of production Ouragans were experimentally adapted for intended use of the type from unprepared airstrips. Modifications included the substitution of the single-wheel main gear to a two-wheel configuration fitted with low pressure tires, which retracted into a fairing installed under the wing roots; drogue parachutes were also installed. Aircraft so fitted were nicknamed \"Barougan\", derived from combining the \"Ouragan\" name with the Arabic word \"baroud\" (battle). This configuration was intended for combat operations in Algeria. On 24 February 1954, the first Barougan performed its first flight. A further three aircraft would be used in the test programme, which involved multiple grass landings at varying weights. In 1958, further development of the Barougan variant was abandoned; some of the test aircraft were later re-converted back to the standard Ouragan configuration.\n\nThe Dassault Ouragan was an early jet-powered fighter aircraft. It employed a straightforward basic layout, with a single divided air intake in the nose that carried air around either side of the cockpit to the engine, which was located directly behind the pilot. The Ouragan was powered by a single Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine, produced under license by Hispano-Suiza. Early aircraft were equipped with Martin-Baker Mk.1 ejection seats, however the majority of production aircraft were outfitted with SNCASO E.86 ejection seats instead. Some of the more advanced aerodynamic features of the Ouragan included its swept tailplane and its thin wing, which was tapered along the leading edge.\n\nIn August 1950, prior to the delivery of any pre-production aircraft, the French government placed an initial order for 150 production Ouragans, with ambitions for as many 850 Ouragans in service with the \"Armee de l'Air\". In 1952, the Ouragan formally entered squadron service with the French Air Force in 1952, where it started to replace aircraft such as the British De Havilland Vampire.\n\nDue to the rapid entry to service of the type, the Ouragan's full test programme had not been completed, and this led to multiple instances of pilots inadvertently executing involuntary manoeuvres. In particular, the aircraft had a tendency to sharply snap during a hard turn, leading to unintended spins. Overall, the Ouragan reportedly proved pleasant to fly; according to Mason, French pilots were pleased with the stability of the aircraft, lending itself well to firing both guns and rockets. Its favourable handling qualities led to the Ouragan performing for two years as the display aircraft of the la Patrouille de France aerobatic team.\n\nThe first 50 Ouragans were built to the \"M.D.450A\" standard, equipped with the Nene 102 engine; the majority of aircraft delivered were to the later \"M.D.450B\" standard, being fitted with a Hispano-Suiza-built Nene 104B engine, which was lighter than the Nene 102 and with slightly greater thrust. Wingtip fuel tanks were fitted as standard in both variants.\n\nIn French service, the frontline service of the Ouragan was short-lived; from May 1955 onwards, the type began to be replaced by the more capable Dassault Mystère IV. In 1961, the last Ouragans were displaced from operational units; a number of aircraft were retained beyond this date in secondary capacities such as advanced tactical and gunnery trainers throughout the mid-1960s.\n\nOn 25 June 1953, India placed an order for 71 Ouragans, these being broadly similar to standard production models, except for being powered by the slightly uprated Nene 105 engine. The first four Ouragans were delivered by air in late October 1953, while further deliveries were performed by sea; by mid-1954, all aircraft had been delivered. In March 1957, two additional orders for 20 and 13 second-hand Ouragans were placed, bringing the total procured by India to 104. The selection of the French-built Ouragan at this time is claimed to have reflected a deliberate decision to initiate diversification of supply sources. In Indian service, the aircraft was given the name \"Toofani\" (), the Hindi equivalent meaning the French name of the type.\n\nIn 1961, Indian Toofanis were flown on active service, reportedly carrying out airstrikes in support of Indian Army forces engaged with Portuguese forces on the island of Diu, on the western coast of the Indian sub-continent. They were also used in ground-attack missions against anti-government rebels in Assam and Nagaland, and in 1962 to perform reconnaissance missions during the Sino-Indian War. On 24 April 1965, a single Toofani strayed over the border with Pakistan, and was forced to land by a Lockheed F-104 Starfighter of the Pakistan Air Force; while the pilot was returned to India, the aircraft was retained and ended up being displayed at the Pakistan Air Force Museum at Peshawar.\n\nAs was the case in France, the Ouragan started to be replaced in frontline service by the Mystère IVA in 1957, being withdrawn fully from frontline service in 1965, although it continued in use for some years as an advanced trainer and target tug.\n\nIn contrast to France and India, the Israel Air Force (IAF) became an enthusiastic Ouragan user. During the early 1950s, Israel, under pressure from regional hostilities with neighbouring Arab nations, was keen to acquire new military equipment of its own, particularly as Arab air forces were themselves commonly procuring advanced Soviet armaments such as the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 fighter. Seeking to augment its jet aircraft fleet of British Gloster Meteors, the IAF initially evaluated both French Dassault Mystère IIC and Canadian-built Canadair Sabre Mk.6 fighters. Due to development problems with the Mystère and a Canadian embargo on the Sabres, the order was changed to Mystère IVAs alongside a batch of Ouragans that were purchased as a stop-gap measure.\n\nBy 1955, the IAF had received at least 75 aircraft, comprising a mix of newly-built and retired French Air Force examples, with deliveries being completed that year. The Israeli Ouragans were assigned to a total of five squadrons for the purpose of performing close air support operations, since they could not match the performance of Egyptian MiG-15s. On 12 April 1956, an Israeli Ouragan shot down an Egyptian de Havilland Vampire flying over Israeli territory, it being the first recorded kill by an Ouragan in Israeli service.\n\nDuring the 1956 Suez Crisis, Ouragans principally flew ground-attack missions, but also flew escort missions. In the early hours of 30 October 1956, a pair of Ouragans shot down four hostile de Havilland Vampires in the Mitla Pass area. The two documented encounters between the Soviet-built MiG-15 fighters and the Ouragan (which were also powered by the Nene engine but furnished with a more modern swept wing) ended with one Ouragan surviving several 37 mm (1.46 in) cannon hits to fly the next day and one MiG-15 being heavily damaged by cannon fire after it entered a turning dogfight with the Ouragans. The poor training of the Egyptian pilots who were consistently unable to realize their advantage in numbers as well as the MiG-15's speed and climb characteristics, helped Ouragans to survive despite their inferior performance.\n\nOn 31 October 1956, a pair of Ouragans armed with rockets strafed the Egyptian destroyer Ibrahim el Awal (ex-HMS \"Mendip\"), contributing to the capture of the ship. According to Munson, Israeli Ouragans were responsible for the destruction of a major proportion of the hostile tanks and military vehicles that came under aerial attack during the conflict, while only two Ouragans were lost during the five days of fighting, both of which were attributed to small arms fire. The Commander-in-Chief of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is reported to have later stated \"The Ouragan was a much better aeroplane than had been thought\".\n\nIn the aftermath of the Suez Crisis, the Ouragans were soon mostly relegated to secondary roles such as advanced training; by 1967, the type still equipped two close-support units along with an operational training unit. Israeli Ouragans saw more combat in the 1967 Six-Day War. In 1975, the IAF sold 18 Ouragans to El Salvador, where they remained in service until the late 1980s.\n\nIn the wake of the Football War of 1969, El Salvador began a concerted push to modernize its air force. Unable to buy combat aircraft from the United States due to a US government arms embargo, the Salvadorans bought 18 surplus Israeli Ouragans on the international arms market. These aircraft were refurbished by the Israelis and were delivered to El Salvador between 1973 and 1978.\n\nEl Salvador's Ouragans saw extensive combat during the Salvadoran Civil War of 1980-1992. Salvadoran Ouragans flew strike missions against communist FMLN forces, operating from Ilopango Air Base located near the capital city of San Salvador. As El Salvador is not a large country and combat radius was not a pressing concern, Salvadoran Ouragans in combat usually operated with their wingtip fuel tanks removed in order to save weight and allow for greater weapons loads.\n\nAn FMLN sapper attack against Ilopango Air Base in 1982 destroyed several Ouragans and accelerated the push to supplant, and eventually replace, the Ouragans with American-made Cessna A-37B Dragonfly ground-attack aircraft, which were made available after the Reagan Administration dropped the arms embargo. The remaining Ouragans served on for several more years, but were all retired by the war's end.\n\nSalvadoran Ouragans have been pictured in several camouflage schemes, and it is possible that during the war the Ouragan fleet operated in colors that were never completely standardized.\n\nAt least one survivor of El Salvador's Ouragan fleet is currently on static display at Ilopango.\n\n\nNumbers from \"World Air Forces\"\n\nA number of MD.450 Ouragan examples are preserved in France including #251 and #450/\"4-US\", part of the jet aircraft collection at Chateau Savigny-lès-Beaune. The Musee de l'Air et de l'Espace at Le Bourget Airport has #154/ \"4-LT\" painted in a colorful \"Indian-head\" scheme but a previous code is just visible under the 4-LT markings. Ouragan #214/\"UG,\" previously stored, is exhibited in the \"Patrouille de France\" paint scheme at the \"Musée Européen de l'Aviation de Chasse,\" Montélimar.\n\nIsraeli Air Force Ouragans \"80\" and \"49\", both combat veterans and survivors of the 1956 Suez War and 1967 Six-Day War, are on outdoor display at the Israeli Air Force Museum.\n\nAn MD.450 Ouragan (Toofani), \"IC 554,\" is on display at the Indian Air Force Museum, Palam, New Delhi. It was painted earlier in grey-green camouflage but now appears in natural metal in No. 47 \"Black Archers\" Squadron markings.\n\nTwo Ouragans are on display in the Museo Nacional de Aviación, Ilopango Air Base.\n\n"}

The use of the West Coast as an outpost to house convicts in isolated penal settlements occurred in the eras 1822–33, and 1846–47.\n\nThe main locations were Sarah Island (known by many in the late twentieth century as Settlement Island) and Grummet Island in Macquarie Harbour. The entrance to Macquarie Harbour was known as Hells Gates and the play on this name has travelled from its naming in the 1830s to Paul Collins's book published in 2002.\n\nConvict parties used the land around the harbour as a work area as far as Gordon River. The prison's existence was for only 15 years, but its hold on the imagination has spawned a significant literature.\n\nWhile most physical traces of the convict era were abandoned or lost, many foundations and outlines of the buildings of the settlement can still be seen. Sarah Island was allegedly vandalised for building materials in the 1890s by mining communities. However, enough remains that guided tours of the island can still give a vivid and moving glimpse into the lives of the convicts and their keepers, and the huge amount of building and land reclamation that took place during the relatively short life of the prison. Piners also have periodically discovered convict era items during their work along the rivers and shore of Macquarie Harbour.\n\nThe \"Frederick\" was a merchant ship stolen in 1834 by escaping convicts from Sarah Island. It has inspired several books and a play.\n\n\"The Ship that Never Was\", by the Round Earth Theatre Company, at the Strahan Visitor Centre, in Strahan, is a long-running play about a successful escape. It was written by Richard Davey, a descendant of Governor Davey who worked on Sarah Island as a guide and researcher. He has also written \"The Sarah Island Conspiracies — an account of twelve voyages to Macquarie Harbour and Sarah Island\" (Hobart, 2002) and two pamphlets — a narrative of the event the play was based on and \"Sarah Island - The People, Ships and shipwrights — a guided tour\". Collins refers to Davey in his \"Hell's Gates\" book.\n\n\"The Ship Thieves\" by Sian Rees focuses upon James Porter one of the group of convicts on \"The Frederick\", and manuscripts found in the Dixson Library in Sydney. Rees had previously written about a very different ship of convicts — the \"Lady Juliana\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His achievements rank alongside those of Wernher von Braun and Sergei Korolev. But as most of his work was for the United States Air Force and was therefore classified, his achievements are not widely known.\n\nKarel Bossart was born on February 9, 1904 in Antwerp, Belgium. He graduated in Mining Engineering at the Université libre de Bruxelles in 1924. After winning a scholarship to Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the Belgian American Educational Foundation to study aeronautical engineering, he remained in the United States, working for various aircraft companies. In 1945 he was chief of structures at Convair and proposed to the United States Air Force that a missile could be developed with a range of 8000 km. The Air Force was skeptical of Bossart's proposal, partly wishing to preserve the priority of strategic bombers, but granted him a limited contract to develop a prototype. Bossart's major innovation was the use of a monocoque design in which structural support was maintained by pressure within the inelastic fuel tanks. After a series of tests in 1947 the Air Force lost interest and Bossart was instructed to abandon the research, but by 1951 the escalation of the Cold War enabled Bossart to revive the project that became known as 'Atlas'. In 1955 the Central Intelligence Agency reported that Soviet Russia had made swift progress on its own intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) programme and Atlas became a crash project of the highest national importance. Bossart used this opportunity to advance work with high energy cryogenic fuels that resulted in the Centaur upper stage.\n\nAtlas was first launched in June, 1957 but was never fully effective as an ICBM. However, use as a launch vehicle, the Atlas design has excelled and has formed the basis of the most successful and reliable expendable rockets in service. As a result, Bossart's achievements include\n\nIn 1955 Bossart became chief engineer of the Atlas project and in 1957 was promoted to Technical Director of Aeronautics at General Dynamics. On December 17, 1957, eleven years of Bossart's work climaxed in the first successful flight of the Atlas. A few days later, on December 22, 1957, he appeared on \"What's My Line?\" as a guest credited as \"Rocket Designer U.S.A.F. Atlas Missile\". The next year, the Air Force awarded him the Exceptional Civilian Award for his work in developing America's first ICBM.\n\nHis co-workers called Bossart one of the finest technical men in the country. They credit him with having spearheaded a major phase in the art of rocketry.\n\nIn 1965, Bossart was inducted into the International Aerospace Hall of Fame for his pioneering contributions to the Atlas rocket system. He is featured in the Hall of Fame's exhibit within the San Diego Air and Space Museum. Bossart was later inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1990.\n\nBossart died on August 3, 1975, in San Diego, California.\n\n"}

Two further prototypes followed, powered by the Rolls-Royce Tay 250 centrifugal-flow turbojet, an improved version of the Rolls-Royce Nene, built under license by Hispano-Suiza, and rated at thrust.\n\nThese three Mystère I prototypes led to two Mystère IIA prototypes, powered by the Tay and armed with four Hispano cannon; and then four Mystère IIB prototypes, which traded the four cannon for two DEFA revolver-type cannon. A Mystère IIA was the first French aircraft to break Mach 1 in controlled flight (in a dive), on 28 October 1951.\n\nThe eleven preproduction machines that followed were designated Mystère IIC, nine of which were fitted with the SNECMA Atar 101C axial-flow turbojet, rated at thrust, while two were experimentally fitted with the afterburning Atar 101F, with an afterburning thrust of .\n\nThe French Air Force ordered 150 Mystère IICs, with the first production machine flying in June 1954, being delivered in October of that year. The production aircraft featured the twin DEFA cannon, an Atar 101D turbojet with thrust, increased tail sweep, and revised intake trunking and internal fuel tank arrangement. Top speed was at low level. Details of external stores are unclear, but a reasonable assumption would be that they were similar to those of the Ouragan.\n\nThe last Mystère IIC was delivered in 1957, by which time the type was already being relegated to advanced training duties. Aircraft design was moving very quickly in the 1950s and even as the Mystère IIC was becoming operational, the better Dassault Mystère IVA was flying. The Mystère IIC was very much an interim type, though it did persist in the training role until 1963.\n\nThere were no foreign buyers for the Mystère II. As noted, the Israelis wanted to buy 24 but changed their minds and bought Mystère IVAs instead. It appears that the Mystère II was never used in combat.\n\n\n\nThis plane can be seen as gate guardian at the Aérodrome d'Abbeville-Drucat (N 50° 08.361 E 001° 49.509)\n\n"}

The International Rugby Board (IRB) selected New Zealand as the host country in preference to Japan and South Africa at a meeting in Dublin on 17 November 2005. The tournament was won by New Zealand, who defeated France 8–7 in the final. The defending champions, South Africa, were eliminated by Australia 11–9 in the quarter-finals. The result marked the third time that the tournament was won by the country that hosted the event (following New Zealand in 1987 and South Africa in 1995).\n\nIt was the largest sporting event ever held in New Zealand, eclipsing the 1987 Rugby World Cup, 1990 Commonwealth Games, 1992 Cricket World Cup and the 2003 America's Cup. Overseas visitors to New Zealand for the event totalled 133,000, more than the 95,000 that the organisers expected. However, there was a drop in non-event visitors, meaning the net increase in visitors over the previous year was less than 80,000.\n\nThe games ran over six weeks, commencing on 9 September 2011 with the opening ceremony showcasing New Zealand's history and diverse cultures. The final was played at Eden Park in Auckland on Sunday 23 October 2011, a date chosen because it fell on a long weekend of New Zealand's Labour Day holiday. \n\nAfter speculation that the number of participating teams would be reduced to 16, the IRB announced on 30 November 2007 that the 2011 tournament would again feature 20 teams. Twelve teams qualified as a result of finishing in the top three in each pool in the 2007 tournament. The remaining eight berths were determined by regional qualifying tournaments. Of the 20 countries that competed in the previous World Cup in 2007, there was only one change – Russia replaced Portugal.\n\nThree nations bid to host the 2011 Rugby World Cup — New Zealand, Japan, and South Africa.\n\nNew Zealand had co-hosted the first Rugby World Cup with Australia in 1987, and had been set to co-host the 2003 World Cup with Australia before a disagreement over ground signage rights resulted in New Zealand being dropped and Australia became the sole host. The 2011 New Zealand bid contained plans to enlarge the size of Eden Park and other stadiums to help increase the commercial viability of the bid.\n\nJapan was bidding to become the first Asian nation to host the first Rugby World Cup. Japan had the necessary infrastructure already in place, by virtue of its co-hosting the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\nSouth Africa had hosted the tournament in 1995. The 2011 South African bid, led by former national captain Francois Pienaar, had strong support from their national government. South Africa had also won the right to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe IRB Council meeting in Dublin on 17 November 2005 announced that New Zealand had been selected after IRB inspections of each applicant host nation during June and July 2005.\n\nThe event was expected to cost about NZ$310 million to run and to generate NZ$280 million in ticket sales. In Auckland, the city where many of the most important games took place, the costs to the local ratepayers alone was estimated at $102 million.\n\nTicket sales exceeding NZ$285 million, accommodation-related spending of another NZ$260 million, and NZ$236 million spent on food and drink was expected to provide a significant fiscal stimulus, of nearly 1.4% of the quarterly GDP.\n\nIn the years between winning the bid and the staging of the event, New Zealand news media and social agencies cast aspersions on the nation's readiness and appropriate use of national funds for sports infrastructure, as has happened with most large, international, quadrennial, multi-location sporting events of recent decades such as the 2012 Olympics, 2010 FIFA World Cup and the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Concerns were raised about the process of upgrading Eden Park to expand the capacity to the 60,000 required by the IRB. In late 2008 Rugby World Cup Minister Murray McCully said the remaining consent process might need to be overridden by legislation for the work to be completed on time.\n\nA July 2009 report by the Auckland Regional Transport Authority, released under the Official Information Act, warned of lack of readiness and complacency, despite the fact that \"the levels of patron movement and operational standard [needed for the RWC] are in reality significantly above what is currently delivered.\" The report was dismissed by Michael Barnett, the Auckland Chamber of Commerce CEO and planning co-coordinator for RWC events in Auckland, who characterised it as a case of \"a Wellington media organisation us[ing] an outdated report\".\n\nThe nation's largest hospitality workers' union, Unite, which represents 25% of hotel, restaurant and casino workers in New Zealand, demanded that workers share in windfall profits and said there was the possibility of a strike during the tournament.\n\nThe construction of Dunedin's Forsyth Barr Stadium, known during the tournament as Otago Stadium, was a source of concern as the project was operating in a tight time frame. An April 2010 progress report stated that the project remained on target for completion prior to the Rugby World Cup, although there was a medium level of risk with some significant and potentially damaging concerns. If the project had not been completed on time, organisers would have reverted to Carisbrook as the backup option. Forsyth Barr Stadium was officially opened on 6 August 2011.\n\nDamage caused by the 2011 Christchurch earthquake forced the relocation of a number of cup matches, including the quarter finals.\n\nThe 2011 Tri Nations Series was shortened to include only six games instead of the usual nine. It served as the primary preparation for the tournament for Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. In the northern hemisphere, a series of friendlies played in August 2011 replaced the annual tours to the southern hemisphere. North American entrants Canada beat USA in two warm-up friendlies in August 2011.\n\nTwenty teams competed in the 2011 World Cup. Twelve teams qualified by finishing in the top three of their pool in the 2007 Rugby World Cup.\n\nTwelve of the nations at this tournament had competed in every previous Rugby World Cup – Argentina, Australia, Canada, England, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Romania, Scotland, and Wales. All the other sides also had previous World Cup experience, except for Russia who appeared in a Rugby World Cup for the first time.\n\nThe following 20 teams, shown with final pre-tournament rankings, qualified for the final tournament.\n\n\nThe 13 venues for the 2011 Rugby World Cup were confirmed on 12 March 2009. A number of the venues were redeveloped to increase capacity for the event. The Government considered passing a law bypassing the consent process to allow all the stadiums' redevelopment to be completed in time.\n\nDue to damage to Stadium Christchurch and many other facilities in Christchurch caused by the earthquake on 22 February 2011, it was announced on 16 March that the matches to be played in the city would be relocated. The two quarter-finals scheduled would be moved to Auckland, while the five pool matches moved to other centres.\n\nOn 10 November 2006, the New Zealand Government announced plans for Stadium New Zealand in Auckland. The proposal was to build the new stadium seating 70,000 on the waterfront. After much public outcry, and lack of support from the Auckland Regional Council, the proposal was dropped in favour of the redevelopment of Eden Park. The redevelopment of Eden Park's Southern and South Western stands was completed during 2010.\n\nDunedin's new stadium, Forsyth Barr Stadium (known as Otago Stadium during the tournament), was completed in August 2011 and was used instead of Carisbrook.\n\nSeeding of teams for the 2011 World Cup was based on their respective IRB World Rankings. The top four at the 2007 Rugby World Cup (South Africa, England, Argentina, and France) were not therefore allocated top pool spots, but \"the rankings are now very well established and provide us with a credible and succinct way of seeding teams for the rugby World Cup pool draw\", according to Rugby World Cup Ltd (RWCL) chairman Syd Millar.\n\nThe draw was conducted in December 2008 and used the World Rankings as of 1 December 2008, after the Northern Hemisphere Autumn internationals. The teams were placed into three bands depending on their seedings at the time, with one team from each band in each of the pools. The rankings and bands were therefore: New Zealand (1), South Africa (2), Australia (3) and Argentina (4); Wales (5), England (6), France (7) and Ireland (8); Scotland (9), Fiji (10), Italy (11) and Tonga (12).\n\nThe full draw and venues for the tournament were announced on 12 March 2009.\n\nThe opening match saw the hosts, New Zealand, take on Tonga.\n\nBy coincidence, the final match and third-place playoff match were between the countries which contested the same matches at the first Rugby World Cup, which were also held in New Zealand, in 1987.\n\nEach country was allowed a squad of 30 players for the tournament. These squads were to be submitted to the International Rugby Board by a deadline of 22 August 2011. Once the squad was submitted a player could be replaced if injured, but would not be allowed to return to the squad. There is also a stand-down period of 72 hours before the new player is allowed to take the field. Hence, a replacement player called into a squad on the eve of a game will not be permitted to play in that game.\n\nOn 8 April 2011, the IRB named ten referees, seven assistant referees and four television match officials to handle the pool stage games. Two of the seven assistants will also be reserve referees if required.\n\n\n\nThe first round, or pool stage, saw the twenty teams divided into four pools of five teams using the same format that was used in 2003 and in 2007. Each pool was a round-robin of ten games, where each team played one match against each of the other teams in the same pool. Teams were awarded four points for a win, two points for a draw and none for a defeat. A team scoring four or more tries in one match scored a bonus point, as did a team losing by seven or fewer points.\n\nThe teams finishing in the top two of each pool advanced to the quarterfinals. The top three teams of each pool have automatically qualified for the 2015 Rugby World Cup.\n\nIf two or more teams were tied on match points, the following tiebreakers would have applied:\n\n\nPld = matches played, W = matches won, D = draws, L = losses, TF = tries for, PF = match points for, PA = match points against, +/− = sum total of points for/against, BP = bonus points, Pts = pool points\n\nThe tournament's top point scorer was South African Morné Steyn, who scored 62 points. Chris Ashton and Vincent Clerc scored the most tries, six in total.\n\nFollowing the completion of the Rugby World Cup, the IRB's Rugby News Service listed the Top 5 players of the 2011 Rugby World Cup. These players were:\n\nSky Network Television, New Zealand's largest subscription television provider, was host broadcaster for the Rugby World Cup, transmitting all matches live and in high definition coverage was available. Games were also available on free-to-air networks in New Zealand but not all pool matches were screened live on free to air. Broadcasting rights were allocated throughout the world by the IRB, including highlights, free to air and pay per view.\n\n\n"}

He played an important role in the events of Norway in 1814 and became known as one of the \"Eidsvoll men\". Together with Niels Aall, he led the negotiations with Swedish general Magnus Björnstjerna which resulted in the Convention of Moss. Later, he participated in several government positions. He was a prominent minister and received the post of First minister when the former First minister Mathias Sommerhielm left Christiania in 1822.

Additionally it produced a 75mm f/3.5 lens with built-in shutter (bypassing the focal-plane shutter for high-speed synchronization with electronic flash); the most remarkable lens in the line-up remained the 80mm standard lens with a fast opening of f/2, fast for a medium-format lens.

She was influenced by the pedagogical ideas of Maria Montessori as well as Calvin Brainerd Cady's ideas about teaching broader values through music education. Martha Graham described her as \"a small, round, plump little lady with the dynamism of a rocket\". She founded the Cornish School in 1914 and served as the school's director for the next 25 years. Within three years it had enrolled over 600 students, and was the country's largest music school west of Chicago.\n\nHer middle name reflects the year of her birth, the hundredth anniversary of the founding of the United States of America.\n\nBorn July 1876 in Nebraska, she grew up first in Arlington, Oregon and then in Blaine, Washington, as the daughter of the town's first mayor, lawyer Nathan Armfield Cornish. In her early teens, she lived about half a year in Portland, Oregon, where she studied piano under Ebenezer Cook, a teacher of strong local reputation. Shortly after, her father's fortunes and her mother's health began to fail. Her parents moved to Spokane, Washington, where her mother died two years later; Nellie stayed in Blaine much of that time, teaching fourth grade although still in her teens. Her father remarried to a woman she did not like, leading to a break with him. In her early twenties, she gave music lessons and did other tutoring in northwestern Oregon.\nShe moved to Seattle in 1900, and took a studio in 1902 in the Holyoke Building (the center of Seattle music instruction at the time), which gave her a chance to meet nearly all of the city's leading music teachers. In 1904, she traveled to Boston for the summer to learn the Evelyn Fletcher-Copp's Montessori-influenced method of teaching piano to young children. From this, she evolved her own technique of teaching.\n\nBy 1911, when she left for Los Angeles, California to study for six weeks with Calvin Brainerd Cady, she was a very well established Seattle music teacher, with a suite of five studio rooms and two assistants. (She would later hire Cady as a faculty member at the Cornish School.) She returned to Seattle and modified her approach to teaching to incorporate Cady's ideas about using music education to impart a broader spiritual approach to life in general. However, the combination of disappointment in romance and a reconciliation with her father led her to turn over her studio to one of her assistants, Martha Sackett, and join her father in Alturas, California, where he had somewhat recovered his fortune. A plan for father and daughter to travel together to Europe was scotched by the outbreak of World War I; plans to study in New York City also fell through, as did an effort to establish herself in Salt Lake City.\n\nShe returned to Seattle, where she founded the Cornish School in 1914. Within three years it had enrolled over 600 students, and was the country's largest music school west of Chicago. The curriculum soon expanded to include subjects as diverse as eurhythmics, French language, painting, dance (folk and ballet), and theater. She went on to serve as the school's director for the next 25 years.\n\nAlthough she often moved among the rich and famous, Cornish did not have any particularly large sum of her own money, and was at times totally broke. Neither Cornish not the school itself owned the custom-built 1921 building now known as Kerry Hall: the school was a tenant renting the building, which in turn was rather heavily mortgaged by the group of supporters who owned it. In 1923, the entire financial arrangement nearly came crashing down, and only some last minute donations prevented the school from having to move to Los Angeles. The next year, the realty company that owned the building converted itself into a foundation to support the school, and took on its debts. However, there was no endowment, and finances remained precarious even through what Cornish called the school's \"golden years\" in the mid-1920s. This remained the case even after the mortgage was paid off and the building donated to the school in 1929, and financial difficulties inevitably grew during the Great Depression. The Board neither raised an endowment nor otherwise put the school on a financial footing that would allow it to do more than \"tread water.\" Ultimately, this led Cornish to resign her position as head of the school in 1939.\n\nAfter leaving her school, Cornish spent three years of \"rest and gardening\" in California; spent half a year in an unsuccessful New York-based venture to improve children's radio programming; and then spent four years as head of the Pittsfield Community Music School (Pittsfield, Massachusetts). She spent her last years mainly in California, and sometimes in Seattle.\n\nCornish never married. According to Nancy Wilson Ross, \"Twice she was deeply in love and lost the men to other women…\" She adopted the orphaned Elena Miramova as her daughter.\n\nIn 1921, Cornish led a successful fundraising drive to save the Seattle Symphony.\n\n\n"}

These include commercial record releases (chiefly from the UK), radio broadcasts (many from the BBC Sound Archive), and privately made recordings.\n\nThe history of the Sound Archive can be traced back to 1905, when it was first suggested that the British Museum should have a collection of audio recordings of poets and statesmen. The Gramophone Company started donating metal masters of audio recordings in 1906 (on the basis that records would wear out), with a number of donations being made up until 1933. These recordings included some by Nellie Melba, Adelina Patti, Caruso and Francesco Tamagno, and others of Lev Tolstoy, Ernest Shackleton, Herbert Beerbohm Tree and Lewis Waller. A number of shellac pressings were also donated in the period 1920–50.\n\nIn 1955, Patrick Saul founded the \"British Institute of Recorded Sound\", after realising that material was in danger of being lost as the British Museum did not maintain a comprehensive archive. The Institute was located in a property owned by the British Museum in Russell Square (with rent and rates guaranteed by Robert Mayer), and supported by a donation from the Quaker trust in Birmingham. A public appeal resulted in the donation of thousands of shellac discs, which started off the collection.\n\nThe British Institute of Recorded Sound became part of the British Library, which had been split off from the British Museum, in April 1983. It was later renamed the British Library Sound Archive. The metal masters originally collected by the British Museum were transferred to the Archive in 1992.\n\nThe specialist collections are:\n\nThe Sound Archive holds an extensive reference collection of printed materials relating to recordings. The collection includes books and periodicals from around the world, a wide-ranging collection of discographies, and one of the largest collections of commercial record catalogues dating back to the early 1900s.\n\nA reference collection of playback and recording devices, including historic gramophones and record players, that chart the history of sound reproduction equipment. Photographs of some of these may be viewed online. In addition, the Sound Archive's engineering department maintains a wide selection of working playback tape and disc players for the purposes of digitising its sound collections.\n\nThe Sound Archive provides a range of services. The Sound Archive's online catalogue of over 1.5 million recordings can be viewed at http://cadensa.bl.uk, and it is updated daily. Recordings may be listened to free of charge in the British Library Reading Rooms. Copies of recordings can be purchased subject to copyright clearance and spectrograms of wildlife sounds can be made to order. The British Library Sounds service provides free online access for UK higher and further education institutions to over 90,000 rare recordings of music, spoken word, and human and natural environments. 65% of these recordings are also freely accessible for public listening online.\n\nThe British Library offers training workshops and events in oral history and wildlife sound recording, as well as audiovisual archiving internships.\n\n\"Playback\", the bulletin of the British Library Sound Archive, was published free of charge from 1992 to 2010. All 44 issues are available online. A range of British Library CDs are available covering nature sounds, world music, historical speeches and recordings of famous poets, playwrights and authors.\n\n\n"}

The scheme is supported by the Home Office, the Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) and the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC).\nIt acts as an umbrella system: it does not itself issue identification cards, but various proof of age card schemes operate under the PASS umbrella, and issue cards which bear a PASS hologram as proof of authenticity and validity. \n\nSet up in 2001 to develop a recognisable way of endorsing proof of age card schemes, due to the United Kingdom not issuing a government identification card, individuals who didn‘t drive had difficulty providing any proof of age when purchasing age-restricted products such as cigarettes and alcohol.\n\nIn June 2014, the 18+ card designs were standardised (apart from the Young Scot card in Scotland), with the only real variation in appearance being the logo of the issuing organisation in the corner, citing feedback from police and retailers, in an effort to increase acceptance by venues especially in the night-time economy.\n\nIn November 2016, PASS reorganised to become a community interest company and ownership by the British Retail Consortium ended. In January 2018, the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) logo replaced the Association of Chief Police Officers' (ACPO) logo at the lower left corner of the standardised 18+ card design.\n\n there are two types of card suppliers, national and regional. Regional cards often have requirements for residency in the area they are issued, where national cards can be obtained by anyone who can provide required information. There are currently three councils that offer regional cards: Bracknell Forest Council (e+ card), Milton Keynes Council (All in 1 Card) and the London Borough of Southwark (\"PAL\"). The national suppliers are CitizenCard, TOTUM, My ID Card, ONEID4U, and ValidateUK. The Young Scot card is available to eligible individuals resident in Scotland.\n\nProof of Age Standards Scheme's goal is to become the preferred standard in proving the age of Britons, with 5 million cards issued since 2001 and 200,000 in 2017 to 2018.\nSeveral trade bodies currently support PASS: Association of Convenience Stores, British Beer and Pub Association, British Institute of Innkeeping, UK Hospitality and the Wine and Spirits Trade Association. In addition the Home Office, the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, National Police Chiefs' Council and Security Industry Authority also support the organisation.\n\nIt is the responsibility of sellers not to supply alcohol, tobacco, and other age restricted products to people below the legal age. Checking a proof of age card protects them against inadvertently selling to under-age people who look older. Some places requiring proof of age will not accept some cards, despite the PASS hologram. Retailers and licensees have the right to refuse to sell a product or deny entry to an individual even if they possess a PASS endorsed card. In 2011 more than 500,000 holders of a PASS endorsed card were refused entry to pubs and clubs. As a result, in 2014 the police and Security Industry Authority, which licences doorstaff, agreed to permit their logos to be displayed on PASS cards displaying a standardised design. In 2017 the Passport Office urged passport-holders to leave passports at home and use a PASS card on nights out.\n\nIn 2019 PASS agreed to develop Standards for the Presentation of Digital Proof of Age with the purpose of enabling the Home Office to amend the Mandatory Licensing Conditions so that approved forms of both digital and physical proof of age could be accepted by licensees for the purpose of demonstrating due diligence.\n"}

Domhnail O'Murchadha, assistant professor of sculpture, encouraged him to complete a sculpture diploma. He then spent a year obtaining an Art Teachers Certificate and became a sculpture associate of the college, where he stayed until 1972 apart from eighteen months as art teacher in Navan Vocational School.\n\nIn 1972 Conlon returned to Sligo to teach at the Sligo Vocational School for a year before becoming a lecturer at the Sligo Regional Technical College (now Sligo Institute of Technology), where he helped to develop a diploma course in art. For the next sixteen years he lectured in sculpture and drawing there until his early retirement 1989.\n\nHe worked full-time as a professional sculptor until early 2004, when a brain tumour (Glioma) was diagnosed. Although some 80% of the tumour was removed, Conlon was physically incapacitated and required extensive care for the remaining year of his life. During that year he worked on a video installation entitled \"Become\".\n\nConlon's works include \"Millennium Garden Sculpture\" at Lucan Community College. He worked in stone, creating large abstract forms.\n\nHe exhibited with Independent Artists, Oireachtas, the Royal Hibernian Academy and Sculpture in context.\n\nJack Harte has written an account of Conlon's life, \"Unravelling the Spiral - The Life and Work of Fred Conlon (1943–2005)\" (Scotus Press, Dublin, 2010). Harte and Conlon were born within fifty metres of one another, and ten months apart, in the townland of Killeenduff. They were cousins and close friends until Conlon's death. In this book Harte warmly tells the remarkable story of Conlon's life and provides a unique insight into his ideas and inspiration. Pursuing the sculptor's fascination with the spiral motif, Harte unravels the Neolithic symbolism of the Spiral and the Newgrange Monument to illustrate the subliminal pagan inspiration underneath Conlon's overtly Christian spiritual urges. The book is illustrated with photographs of Conlon's work.\n\n"}

But Ravi breaks up when he comes to know that she would be disinherited. Kalyani's father, who stays in the United States, is unaware of the break up and comes home in Kerala to spend time with his daughter and son-in-law. This prompts family friend and Advocate Kaimal (Venu) to hire a thief, Vishnu (Mohanlal) to act as Kalyani's husband during Menon's vacation stay.\n\n\"Chithram\" was released during a Christmas weekend on 23 December 1988.

Kalyani, brought up in Madras by her father's friend Purushothaman Kaimal (Nedumudi Venu), falls in love with another man and decides to marry against the wishes of her father. When her boyfriend finds out that she will be disinherited, he ditches her at the altar.\n\nAfter a short while her father decides to retract his disapproval and spend a fortnight's vacation with his daughter and son-in-law in his estate near a tribal community where Menon is the chief. Because her father is already ill and because this may be his last vacation, Kalyani and Kaimal want to make it as happy for him as possible. They decide to conceal the fact that her boyfriend dumped her.\n\nVishnu (Mohanlal) comes into the picture who played a trick on a foreigner by fibbing to him that his brother cannot swim. Then the foreigner jumps into the river and Vishnu then runs off with his clothes. The foreigner questions and asks Kaimal about his clothes, with Kaimal getting slapped. Kaimal then goes to Vishnu and confronts him for stealing the clothes. Vishnu states his urgent need for money and Kaimal hires Vishnu to play the part of the husband for 14 days.

The warden does not reply to this question, as he is helpless regarding this. After a happy fortnight, Kalyani's father returns to the US.
