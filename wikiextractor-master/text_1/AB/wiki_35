Picnic bars are lumpy in shape. It is sold in Australia, parts of Canada (such as Quebec), New Zealand, New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, India, Ireland, Russia, Ukraine, South Africa (packaged as \"Lunch Bar\") and the United Kingdom. The UK and Indian versions differ from the Australasian version in that they also contain raisins. The Cadbury Picnic bar was first released in the UK in 1958.\n\nIn 1967, Cadbury acquired MacRobertson Chocolates, a well-respected Australian confectionery manufacturer founded in 1880. The move gave Cadbury another major manufacturing base on the Australian mainland - at Ringwood in Melbourne, Victoria. It also added a range of unique confectionery brands, including Old Gold (launched in 1919), Picnic, Cherry Ripe (created in 1924) and Freddo Frog (created in 1930), which were household names.\n\nA marketing slogan for the Picnic, released in the early 2000s, was \"Deliciously ugly\". During the 1970s the Australian slogan for Picnic was \"More like a banquet than a picnic\". Picnic is manufactured by Cadbury UK. \n\nIn Australia, limited-edition variants Picnic Honeycomb (a Picnic bar with honeycomb pieces), Picnic Hedgehog (a picnic bar with biscuit pieces) and Picnic Rocky Road (a Picnic bar with mini marshmallows and gumdrops) have been sold in recent years. In 2010, a limited edition Almond Picnic bar was made available in New Zealand and is now also available in Australia under the name Roast Almond Feast.\n\nIn April 2009 Cadbury altered the weight of the standard Picnic bar from 50 grams down to 48.4 grams.\nAgain in August 2014 Cadbury altered the weight of the standard Picnic bar down to 46g in Australia, with a noticeable\nreduction in the width of the bar, yet still in the old size wrapper. \n\nIn the UK the standard bar is 48.4 grams as of 2018 and is also available in multipacks.\n\nIn 2011, a fruit and nut picnic bar was released in Australia.\n\nNow in Russia as of 2018, there are two variants of the bar available, classic one with peanuts and raisins and another one with walnuts, at first released as of limited-edition but later included in the permanent line.[https://ru.mondelezinternational.com/about-us/picnic <nowiki>[3]</nowiki>]\n\n\n"}

Her parents had strong Unitarian beliefs and were active in the Chartist movement.\n\nAt the age of 18 she eloped and married a bookkeeper, Jabez Mycroft Silcock. They had four children together; however, Silcock died and Miller took up sewing to support the family. In 1874 Miller married William Calderwood, and they migrated with Miller's children to Queensland, arriving in 1879. Calderwood died in 1880, and Miller married Andrew Miller in Brisbane in 1886.\n\nIn Queensland, Miller worked as a gentlemen's shirt maker and seamstress. Along with May Jordan McConnel, she formed the first women's union in Brisbane, the Brisbane Women's Union, in September 1890 supported by a campaign by William Lane in the Brisbane \"Worker\" newspaper. As a seamstress she gave evidence at the 1891 Royal Commission into Shops, Factories and Workshops, that highlighted the existence of many sweatshops that exploited women workers. Through this period Miller was an active participant in the Early Closing Association.\n\nWith the great strikes of the 1890s, Miller was active in supporting the 1891 Australian shearers' strike and in setting up the Prisoners' Relief Fund for the twelve arrested strike leaders. While William Lane chose to set up in 1892 the New Australia community in Paraguay along socialist lines which attracted many labour activists, Miller believed Lane was \"opting out of the struggle\" and became a foundation member of the Workers' Political Organisation, a forerunner of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland. She became colloquially known as \"Mother Miller\", as she was the most dominant female figure in the Queensland labour movement.\n\nMiller was a founding member of the Women's Equal Franchise Association, which was established in 1894 and almost immediately suffered a split. Leontine Cooper left to form the Women's Suffrage League, alleging that the WEFA was too close to the labour movement which could hinder women's enfranchisement. Miller remained and was elected President. She held the position until 1905, when the organisation disbanded on the successful attainment of women's suffrage. Despite the differences, Miller, Cooper and the conservative Women's Christian Temperance Union often worked together on suffrage issues.\n\nWomen were enfranchised under the Federal Electoral Act on 9 April 1902, becoming the first women of the world to win the right to vote for a national parliament. (Women in New Zealand won the right to vote in colonial elections in 1893). Members of the Women's Equal Franchise Association actively canvassed for the women's vote for the December 1903 Federal election, by forming the Women Workers' Political Organisation with Miller as president. After the Federal election Miller stood down as president, but became President of the Political Labour Council in Brisbane. Women were granted the vote for the Queensland parliament on 25 January 1905, although not the right to stand for parliament. The following year Emma Miller embarked on a tour of western Queensland under the auspices of the Australian Workers' Union, speaking at large public rallies and helping to form local branches of the Workers' Political Organisation and the Women Workers' Political Organisation.\n\nDuring the 1912 Brisbane General Strike for the right to organise trade unions, Miller led a contingent of women to Parliament House. During the march, the women were charged by policemen with batons, and Miller thrust her hat-pin into the Police Commissioner's horse, causing the horse to throw him and injure him severely.\n\nMiller was also involved in anti-conscription activism over the course of World War I. She joined the Women's Peace Army when Cecilia John and Adela Pankhurst visited Brisbane in 1915, and was elected President. The following year she attended the Australian Peace Alliance conference in Melbourne, and is reputed to have attended the Yarra Bank where she denounced militarism from her soapbox. The NO campaign against the first conscription ballot on 28 October 1916 was a success, attributed by many historians to the strong women's anti-conscription campaign.\n\nIn January 1917 Miller travelled to Toowoomba for several weeks rest. At her last public meeting in the Toowoomba Botanical Gardens she impressed on the women present the \"need to play a part in the Labor movement as it meant as much to them as the men\". Two days later Emma Miller died of cancer. The flag at Brisbane Trades Hall was flown at half mast for the \"mother of the Australian Labor Party\". A state funeral was offered but was refused by her surviving son. Miller was buried at Toowong Cemetery.\n\nIn August 1917 the \"Worker\" magazine published a poem in memorial to Miller. In 1922, a marble bust of her by James Laurence Watts was unveiled at the Queensland Council of Unions. A statue is located in King George Square in Brisbane, and there is also an Emma Miller Place located off Roma Street in Brisbane. In 1987 the Queensland Council of Unions established the Emma Miller Award, which is presented each year to women who have made an outstanding contribution to their union.\n\nIn 2003, Miller's life story was featured in the exhibition \"A Lot on Her Hands\", presented by the Australian Workers' Heritage Centre.\n\nThe electoral district of Miller created in the 2017 Queensland state electoral redistribution was named after her.\n\n\n"}

From 2001 to 2011, the Bossier-Shreveport Mudbugs played in the Central Hockey League. From 1997 until 2000, they were known as the Shreveport Mudbugs, changing the name to the Bossier-Shreveport Mudbugs after the team relocated from the Hirsch Coliseum in Shreveport to the CenturyTel Center in Bossier City.\n\nOne of the few successful sports teams from the Bossier-Shreveport area, the Mudbugs found success early. Coached by former Mudbug player Scott Muscutt and owned by Tommy and Leslie Scott, the team increased attendance each year and hosted the All-Star festivities for the Central Hockey League in 2007. The Mudbugs maintained heated rivalries with the Texas Brahmas, Laredo Bucks, Mississippi RiverKings, and Colorado Eagles.\n\nIn their first four seasons, the Mudbugs saw their most success. After the sweep from the Fort Worth Brahmas in the second round of their opening season, the Mudbugs went on to win the President's Cup Championships three straight years in the WPHL. Following the merger of the WPHL and CHL, the Mudbugs found their way back to the Ray Miron President's Cup Finals three times (2004, 2006, 2011). The Mudbugs were the only team in history of the WPHL and CHL to ever win the Cup three straight years.\n\nDuring the 2009–10 season, Mudbugs legend goaltender Ken Carroll and Travis Clayton were named to the Central Hockey League's All Decade Team.\n\nOn July 20, 2010 former player Jason Campbell was named the new Vice President & General Manager for the Mudbugs.\n\nWith the merger of the CHL and the IHL beginning with the 2010–11 season, the Mudbugs played in the Berry Conference. The Mudbugs would go on to win the Ray Miron President's Cup that season in a 7-game series with the Colorado Eagles, but would cease operations two weeks later citing low attendance and financial issues.\n\nIn October 2015, it was announced that a new Mudbugs team would return for the 2016–17 season after signing a 12-year lease agreement with the Louisiana State Fairgrounds to play their home games in the Hirsch Coliseum as a member of the Tier II junior North American Hockey League. On April 8, 2016, the Shreveport Mudbugs were officially announced as an expansion team in the NAHL.\n\n\n\n"}

The team originally played at the Fort Worth Convention Center but played their final six seasons, including their 2008–09 Championship season at the NYTEX Sports Centre. The CHL officially announced the team was going inactive on June 16, 2013.\n\nOriginally announced as the Fort Worth Bulls but forced to change their name after the Birmingham Bulls objected, the team began play in the Western Professional Hockey League as the Fort Worth Brahmas (named after Brahma bulls) while the CHL's Fort Worth Fire were still in operation. The Fire eventually ceased operations. The Fort Worth Brahmas played their home games at the Fort Worth Convention Center.\n\nDue to problems negotiating a lease with the Fort Worth Convention Center, the Brahmas announced on May 3, 2006, that they would suspend operations for the 2006–07 season. However, they returned for the 2007–08 season as the Texas Brahmas and began play in the NYTEX Sports Centre (formerly known as the Blue Line Ice Complex) in North Richland Hills, Texas. NYTEX Sports is owned by former Brahmas minority owners, Sal and Frank Trazzera.\n\nTheir first season in North Richland Hills proved to be very successful as they entered the postseason for the first time since the 2001–02 season. In the first round the Brahmas defeated the Mississippi RiverKings then went on to sweep the Bossier-Shreveport Mudbugs in 4 games with David Cacciola in goal. In the Northern Conference Finals the Brahmas took the series to game 7 before losing to the defending champions, the Colorado Eagles.\n\nIn 2008–09, the Texas Brahmas won the Southeast Division and defeated the Odessa Jackalopes in 7 games to capture the Southern Conference Championship. The Texas Brahmas advanced to the Ray Miron President's Cup Finals to face the Colorado Eagles, whom they defeated 4 games to 1. The 2008–09 CHL Championship was the first by the Texas/Ft. Worth Brahmas franchise and the first for the Fort Worth area since the Fort Worth Fire won the 1996–97 CHL Governor's Cup.\n\nThe Brahmas lost in the playoffs of the 2009–10 season in a close 2-1 fifth game against the Odessa Jackalopes.\n\nThe 2010-2011 season for the Brahmas ended on losing note in the 1st round of the playoffs against the Odessa Jackalopes in four games, three games to one. \n\nVery shortly prior to the start of the 2012-2013 preseason, the team was sold to a Fort Worth-based investment group and returned to the Fort Worth Brahmas branding for the 2012–2013 season. The membership of investment group was still in flux when the season began and some of the big money contributors never officially came into the fold. The team struggled with financial issues throughout the season before the franchise went inactive for at least one season a second time. \n\nAfter the franchise folded, the Texas Tornado of the North American Hockey League relocated to the Fort Worth suburb of North Richland Hills and became the Lone Star Brahmas and began play at the NYTEX Sports Centre beginning with the 2013-14 season.\n\n"}

The Bucks played in Laredo, Texas, United States at the Laredo Energy Arena, formerly known as the Laredo Entertainment Center. On May 1, 2012, the management, citing declining attendance and revenue reversals, announced that the team would suspend operations for the following season, with hopes of returning or relocating the team. On August 1, it was announced that the Laredo Bucks were sold and moved to St. Charles, Missouri and would be renamed the St. Charles Chill.\n\nArena Ventures, made up of six businessmen, teamed up with the City of Laredo to build a state-of-the-art facility for the Laredo area and South Texas. On August 12, 2002, Laredo voters approved a tax increase to pay for the new arena, which cost $36.5 million. The arena was managed by SMG.\n\nAfter the success the Central Hockey League has had in South Texas in the previous years, Laredo was encouraged to bring the first professional sports franchise into the city. The Bucks were successful, averaging attendance over 6,200 (78% capacity) in the regular season and nearly 6,500 (81% capacity) in the playoffs. The LEC Arena held 8,002 fans from 2002 to 2007, but was lowered to 6,500 starting with the 2007–08 season. The Bucks claimed the Ray Miron President's Cup (CHL Championship) for the 2003–04 and 2005–06 seasons and the Governor's Cup (regular season championship) in the 2003–04 season. The Bucks won four straight Southern Conference Championships from 2004 to 2007, and Southeast Division Championship for the five seasons (2004 to 2008).\n\nUntil August 2007, the Laredo Bucks' AHL affiliate was always the San Antonio Rampage of the American Hockey League. From 2002 to 2005 (three seasons), the Bucks were affiliated with the Florida Panthers (National Hockey League). The Bucks' NHL affiliate changed to the Phoenix Coyotes for the 2005–06 season.\n\nThe Bucks also hosted the CHL All-Star game in the 2004–05 season. The Laredo Bucks have sent many players to the Annual Central Hockey League All-Star game. In the 2002–03 season, Laredo sent forwards Chris Grenville, Eric Schneider, and defenceman Michel Periard to Oklahoma City to compete in the CHL All-Star game. Chris Grenville captured the hardest shot award at the skills competition. The following season (2003–04), Laredo sent players Patrik Nilson, Serge Dube, Jeff Bes and Brent Cullaton. Cullaton captained the Southern Conference team and captured the fastest skater award, while Nilson won the accuracy shooting award. Coach Terry Ruskowski and his staff coached the Southern Conference because the Bucks had the best winning percentage at the break. In 2005, Laredo sent another three players: Adam Paiment, Jeremy Symington and Brent Cullaton. The North went on to beat the South 14–13 in a shootout. Brent Cullaton won the fastest skater title for the second time in a row. In 2006, coach Ruskowski, forward Jeff Bes, right wing James Hiebert, and defensemen Serge Dube all earned a spot on the all-star team. Jeff Bes won the CHL Southern Conference All-Star MVP in that year for his four-goal effort. The 2006–07 Bucks All-Stars were Ruskowski, Bobby Chaumont, Chris Korchinski, and Adam Rivet. In the 2007–08 season the Bucks had three players voted as starters in the all-star game. Jeff Bes (3rd), Serge Dube (3rd), and Dustin Traylen (1st) represented the Bucks. In the 2008–09 season in a strange CHL All-Star game the Bucks had two players called to the All-Star game Darryl Smith and Sebastien Centomo, Darryl Smith won the All-Star MVP.\n\nThe Bucks hosted the CHL All-Star game in the 2009–10 season for the second time and the first time a CHL team would host the event in the same arena twice (LEC). The format was South Texas (Laredo Bucks, Corpus Christi IceRays, and Rio Grande Valley Killer Bees) against The CHL All-Stars and was held on January 13, 2010.\n\nCoach Terry \"Rosco\" Ruskowski coached the Laredo Bucks in all of its franchise history except for the last season, 2011–12, when the team disbanded. In 2007, Ruskowski entered the final year of a four-year contract extension with the Bucks. Ruskowski told the \"Laredo Morning Times\" that his tenure was in the hands of Bucks chairman Glenn Hart, owner Julian \"Kiki\" DeAyala, and team president John Beckelhymer and that he had \"full faith\" that he will obtain his third contract with the club. Ruskowski's optimism paid off, for he was shortly thereafter given a \"lifetime contract\" as the Bucks' coach. He resigned four years later amid declining revenues for the team.\n\nOn May 1, 2012, minority owner Glenn Hart announced that due to declining attendance, the Laredo Bucks would go dormant while still maintaining a license in the Central Hockey League. However, their franchise license was purchased on August 1 and began to play as the St. Charles Chill in the 2013–14 season. The CHL itself would fold in 2014.\n\nIn 2018, a new ownership group obtained the rights to the Bucks' name for a junior hockey team. The new team was a charter member of the USA Central Hockey League (USACHL) that began play in October 2018 before the entire league folded less than two months later.\n\nRecords are as of the conclusion of the 2008–2009 season.\n\n\nParticular players and personnel that have been recognized numerous times by the CHL\n\n2002–03\n\n2003–04\n\n2004–05\n\n2005–06\n\n2006–07\n\n2007-08\n\n2008-09\n\n"}
{"id": "1958490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958490", "title": "Colony in Space", "text": "Colony in Space\n\nColony in Space is the fourth serial of the eighth season of the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\", which was first broadcast in six weekly parts on BBC1 from 10 April to 15 May 1971.\n\nThe serial is set on the mineral-rich human colony world of Uxarieus in 2472. In the serial, the alien time traveller the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) and his travelling companion Jo Grant (Katy Manning) are sent by the Time Lords to Uxarieus, where they discover a mining corporation has been faking monster attacks on the colonists. Later, the Master (Roger Delgado), one of the Doctor's people, arrives in search of an ancient doomsday weapon created by the natives of the planet.\n\nThree Time Lords meet at an observatory and discuss the theft of confidential files relating to \"the Doomsday Weapon.\" They begrudgingly realise that only one man can help them so the Third Doctor, accidentally accompanied by Jo Grant, is temporarily released from his exile and sent in the TARDIS to the desert planet of Uxarieus in the year 2472. There he finds an outpost of human colonists living as farmers. The colony is not a success – the land seems unusually poor and recently they are being besieged by representatives of rapacious mining corporations, and more recently, ferocious reptiles. The colony's governor, Robert Ashe, makes them welcome, and explains the colonists fled a year ago to the planet to escape the overcrowding and pollution on Earth.\n\nTwo colonists die in a reptile attack that night, and the next morning a man named Norton arrives at the settlement, claiming that he is from another colony that was wiped out by the reptiles. While the Doctor is investigating the dome of the dead colonists he is surprised by a mining robot controlled by Caldwell, a mineralogist for the IMC (Interplanetary Mining Corporation). Caldwell invites the Doctor to talk to his bosses and hear their side of the story. His superior, Dent, is a ruthless mining engineer, who has been using the mining robot to scare and now kill the colonists – something which Caldwell finds repellent. Dent knows the planet is rich in rare minerals and wants it for IMC and his greedy troops agree that this should be done at any cost.\n\nThe original inhabitants of the planet, known to the colonists as \"primitives\", have a truce with the colonists – but this is tested when Norton kills the colony's scientist and blames it on a primitive, whom he insists are hostile. Later, Norton is seen communicating with Captain Dent, implying that he is in fact a spy sent from IMC to further disrupt the colonists and not the sole survivor of a similar colony as he claimed. The Doctor meanwhile returns to the central dome of the colonists, having evaded an IMC attempt to kill him, and explains to Ashe that the miners are behind the deaths, and not a reptile. An Adjudicator from Earth is sent for to deal with the complex claims over the planet but when he arrives it turns out to be the Master. Impersonating the Adjudicator, he rules that the mining company's claim to the planet is stronger.\n\nThe Doctor and Jo have meanwhile ventured to the primitive city. From images on cave walls they interpret it was once home to an advanced civilisation that degraded over time. In the heart of the city, in a room filled with massive machines and a glowing hatch, they encounter a diminutive alien known as the Guardian. It warns them that intruding into the city is punishable by death, and lets them go, but warns them not to return.\n\nThe Master's adjudication is heard by a returning Doctor and Jo. Still in the Adjudicator's guise he tells Ashe that an appeal will fail unless there are special circumstances, such as historical interest and is intrigued when Ashe tells him about the primitive city. By this ploy he finds out more about the planet and the primitive city while Ashe is drawn away from the Doctor, who begins to lose his credibility with the colonists. The Master then manipulates the Doctor into accompanying him to the primitive city.\n\nThe situation between colonists and miners has meanwhile reached flashpoint with a pitched battle between them. Dent and his forces triumph and he stages a false trial of Ashe and Winton, the most rebellious of the colonists, sentencing them to death but commuting the sentence if all the colonists agree to leave the planet in their damaged old colony ship which first brought them to Uxarieus.\n\nInside the city, the Master tells the Doctor that the primitives were once an advanced civilisation. Before declining, they built a super-weapon that was never used and he wants to claim this weapon for himself. The room with the machinery in the city is the heart of a weapon; so powerful that the Crab Nebula was created during a test firing. The Doctor rejects the Master's overture to help him rule the galaxy using the weapon, stating that absolute power is evil and corrupting. The Guardian appears, demanding an explanation for the intrusion. The Master explains that he's come to restore their civilisation to its former glory. The Doctor argues against him, and the Guardian recalls that the weapon led his race to decay, and its radiation is ruining the planet. It instructs the Doctor to activate the self-destruct, which he does. The city begins to crumble, and the Guardian tells them they must leave before it is too late. While the Doctor and the Master flee they find Caldwell and Jo, and the four get out in time.\n\nThe colonists' ship has meanwhile exploded on take-off as Ashe predicted it would. However, the colony leader was the only one to die. He piloted the ship alone to save his people. Winton and the colonists now emerge from hiding and kill or overpower the IMC men, with Caldwell having switched sides to support the colonists. Amid the confusion, the Master escapes.\n\nWith the battle over, the Doctor explains that the radiation from the weapon was what was killing their crops but this limiting factor has now been removed. Earth has agreed to send a real Adjudicator to Uxarieus, and Caldwell has decided to join the colonists. He tells them that he can help them with their power supply. The Doctor and Jo return to the TARDIS, which returns to UNIT Headquarters mere seconds after it left. Having accomplished what the Time Lords intended, the Doctor is once again trapped on Earth.\n\nScript editor Terrance Dicks has frequently stated that he disliked the original premise of the Doctor being trapped on Earth, and had meant to subvert this plan as soon as he felt he could get away with it. He recalls in a DVD documentary interview (on the \"Inferno\" release) having had it pointed out to him by Malcolm Hulke that the format limited the stories to merely two types: alien invasion and mad scientist.\n\nSusan Jameson was originally cast as Morgan by Michael E. Briant. However, she was replaced by Tony Caunter when the BBC's Head of Drama Serials made an intervention and decided the role was inappropriate for a woman to perform. Jameson was nevertheless paid in full.\n\nThe story functions as social commentary – in this instance, the dangers of colonialism. The story, by former Communist Party of Great Britain member Malcolm Hulke, has been described as \"unashamedly left wing\", with the pioneering colonists and the greedy IMC. As with \"The Space Pirates\" (1969), the story can be seen as a Western in space, with the colonists using rifles like cowboys and the Primitives wielding spears in a similar role to Indians.\n\n16mm colour film trims of location sequences for the story still exist and short clips from this material was used in the BBC TV special \"\" (1993).\n\nPaul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping gave the serial a mixed review in \"The Discontinuity Guide\" (1995), writing, \"Well meaning, and much more interesting before the Master arrives, at which point it turns from a Hulke political parable into a typical runaround. Rather like watching socially-aware paint dry.\" In \"The Television Companion\" (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker reprinted some positive reviews from fanzines, but commented that \"although the story is indeed refreshing in its setting and contains some interesting ideas and well-drawn characters, it is distinctly short on visual interest and dramatic incident and consequently comes across as being rather dull and lifeless\". They felt that the Uxarieus civilisation was flawed and the most exciting moment was the reveal of the Master, though that had already been telegraphed at the beginning of the first episode.\n\nIn 2009, \"Radio Times\" reviewer Patrick Mulkern described the story as \"richly detailed, fast-moving drama that rolls out eventfully over a six-week period\", which made it \"indigestible\" to watch all at once. He praised the structure, which allowed it to not tire in the middle, as well as the supporting cast and the conversation between the Doctor and the Master in the last episode. Dave Golder of \"SFX\", reviewing the DVD release, gave the story three out of five stars. He noted that it had ambition, but was \"slow\" and \"visually uninspired\". DVD Talk's John Sinnott rated \"Colony in Space\" three out of five stars, describing it as \"a decent adventure\" with minuses that outweighed the pluses. He noted that the six-episode structure allowed for padding and repeated scenes, but it had \"a lot of interesting aspects\", such as the Time Lords sending the Doctor, the way the story was constructed, and Pertwee and Delgado's chemistry. In 2010, Charlie Jane Anders of io9 named the cliffhanger to the fourth episode – in which the Master decides to shoot the Doctor – as one of the greatest cliffhangers in \"Doctor Who\".\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Malcolm Hulke, was published by Target Books in April 1974 as \"Doctor Who and the Doomsday Weapon\". This was the first serial of the 1971 series to be so adapted; as a result, Hulke breaks continuity by having Jo Grant introduced to the Doctor for the first time, even though on television her introduction was in \"Terror of the Autons\" (and this would be reflected in the later novelisation of that serial). \nThere is another extensive Malcolm Hulke prologue as an elderly Time Lord describes the \nDoctor-Master rivalry to his assistant and learns of the theft of the Doomsday Weapon files. \nThere have been Dutch, Turkish, Japanese and Portuguese language editions. An unabridged reading of the novelisation by actor Geoffrey Beevers was released on CD in September 2007 by BBC Audiobooks.\n\nAlthough the PAL mastertapes had been wiped, NTSC copies were returned to the BBC in 1983 from TV Ontario in Canada. In November 2001, this story was released together with \"The Time Monster\", in a VHS tin box set, entitled \"The Master\". A new transfer was made from the converted NTSC to PAL videotapes but no restoration work was carried out for this release.\n\nThe story was released on DVD in the UK on 3 October 2011. The single disc release has restored picture quality (unrestored clips, cropped and scanned into 16:9 ratio, can be seen in the \"making of\" featurette, giving some indication of the amount of work that was done), and contains four seconds which were missing from VHS and US masters of the story, restoring two lines of dialogue. The DVD's special features included an audio commentary, text commentary, out-takes and a retrospective documentary entitled \"IMC Needs You\" in which cast and crew looked back at the making of the serial.\n"}

The clandestine agency (not bound to any one country) that protects the world (who, generally, is blissfully ignorant) from these threats is simply called the \"Company\". It is usually able to recruit the finest from every profession deemed useful to it, from combat agents to scientists to intelligence personnel.\n\nThe setting usually has players in the dangerous job of agents working for the Company, or in the even more perilous profession of opposing the agency for whatever reason.\n\nThe setting relies heavily on use of various known or less known urban legends and conspiracy theories.\n\nIn \"GURPS Black Ops\", the player characters are super-skilled agents known as \"Black Operatives\", or \"Black Ops\". Individuals having undergone incredibly intense levels of training prior to their graduation, the black ops can be likened to the starring roles of classic action movies.\n\nThe basic skills of every black op include hand-to-hand combat, the use of most small arms, the operation of many forms of modern electronics, basic sciences and espionage and infiltration skills. Beyond this basic expertise, however, each black op belongs to a department which encourages a specialized focus in a certain set of skills.\n\nThe agency which trains and employs the Black Ops is known to its members as the Company. The Company is divided into five departments: Combat, Intelligence, Science, Technology and Security. Every Op belongs to one department and follows that department's directives at all times, even (especially) while on missions working with other departments. As each department has goals which occasionally clashes with the goals of other departments, this often causes friction and competition between the departments. The departments' heads answer only to Argus, who actually encourage inter-department competition as a means for them to \"keep their edge\".\n\nCombat: the first department ever created for the black ops, Combat's mission is straightforward: to locate and destroy the enemy at all costs. Its Ops, called \"Grunts\" by the others, are nearly all experts in hand-to-hand combat (even beyond that of other Ops) as well as in the use of multiple weapons and explosives. In contrast to their brutish exterior, however, most Combat Ops are as intelligent and refined as the rest of the Academy's Graduates, and many are known to appreciate fine art and literature as much as they do their weapons.\n\nIntelligence: this department's function involves information gathering and analysis through any means. While every black op is skilled in the art of espionage, Intelligence Ops are the best at what they do, masters of disguise and experts in the art of infiltration. Called \"Spooks\" by the other departments, Intelligence Ops are respected for their skill, but also known to be overly methodical in their planning.\n\nScience: the scientists of the Company, the purpose of the Science Department is to acquire information on the Company's foes, and to put it to good use. Its members are experts in multiple sciences, from biology and psychology to applied physics. They also provide the department with its doctors and medical specialists. Its members are derisively called \"Geeks\" by the rest of the Company, especially by the Combat Department, with which Science has frequent arguments based on Combat Ops' tendency to blow up the things Science would like to bring home to experiment on.\n\nSecurity: both the least-appreciated and the hardest-working department, Security is charged with protecting the lives of the black ops while maintaining the conspiracy of silence that the Company works under. The Security ops have the broadest training, allowing them to fairly judge the safety of any mission at any point in the operation. They also have the authority to restrict the conduct of any operative on a squad, regardless of which department sponsored the mission, at any time, for any reason (or for no reason). Rarely is this authority used, and if it is, it's almost never questioned by the directors of the departments (though it's often loudly questioned by other squad members). Security Ops, called \"Secops\" by other departments, are also more negatively called \"Squealers\". The other departments consider them a necessary pain, with a tendency towards overprotective behavior\n\nTechnology: created to develop, refine and implement improvements in the general technology level of the Company, they create advanced devices for all of the other departments. This technology is almost constantly experimental and insufficiently tested, as the Technology ops' constant push towards new advancements mean that by the time a device is out of beta testing, another techie has invented something more advanced to replace it. The Technology ops are almost always called \"techies\" or \"hackers\", and have a reputation of being both geniuses and disaster-prone, due to their habit of tinkering with devices in the field, sometimes with mixed results.\n\n\"GURPS Black Ops\" was reviewed in \"The Unspeakable Oath\" #16/17.\n\n"}

During their time in the CHL, the Eagles won two Ray Miron President's Cups, three regular season titles, five conference titles and six division titles in eight seasons. The team was granted a membership as an expansion team in the American Hockey League beginning with the 2018–19 season as the affiliate of the Colorado Avalanche of the National Hockey League.\n\nThe Eagles play at the Budweiser Events Center in Loveland and serve the Fort Collins-Loveland metropolitan area.\n\nThe franchise was founded in 2003 by former Montreal Canadiens player Ralph Backstrom. The Eagles advanced to the playoffs in their first season and won the CHL championship in their second season, 2004–05. They won their division in 2005–06, but lost in the second round of the playoffs to the Bossier-Shreveport Mudbugs, after having defeated the Oklahoma City Blazers in the first round. They would again win the CHL Championship in 2006–07, defeating the Laredo Bucks four games to two in the Cup Finals.\n\nAfter the 2007–08 season, coach Chris Stewart retired, and Kevin McClelland was named as his replacement. Following the 2009–10 season, McClelland was not retained and Stewart - who had been working as team president and general manager since leaving the bench – resumed head coaching duties.\n\nDuring the 2008–09 season, the Eagles hosted the 2009 CHL All-Star Game and took on a group of CHL All-Stars from various teams. The exhibition took place on January 14, 2009, at the Budweiser Events Center, with the Eagles defeating the CHL All-Stars, 8-4.\n\nDuring the 2011 Ray Miron President's Cup playoffs, the Eagles had been rumored to be transferring to the ECHL following the completion of the playoffs. Former International Hockey League commissioner Dennis Hextall has stated that he had heard that the Colorado Eagles may already be included in the ECHL's tentative schedule for the 2011–12 season.\n\nOn May 29, 2011, KEVN-TV in Rapid City, South Dakota reported that Colorado was to move to the ECHL in time for the 2011–12 season. The following day, the team announced that they would have a press conference on May 31 at the Budweiser Events Center and that local media were urged to attend and fans urged to listen to the press conference online or on a local radio station. At the press conference, Head Coach, General Manager and President Chris Stewart announced that the team had been accepted as an expansion franchise in the ECHL for the 2011–12 season.\n\nIn August 2011, the Eagles were assigned to the Western Conference's Mountain Division as part of the league realignment for the 2011–12 ECHL season.\n\nThey served as the second-tier affiliate of the National Hockey League's Winnipeg Jets and the American Hockey League's St. John's IceCaps until the end of the 2012–13 hockey season and then as the Calgary Flames and Adirondack Flames affiliate during the 2014–15 season.\n\nIn July 2016, head coach Chris Stewart retired as coach for the second time but remained with the organization as general manager. He was replaced by assistant coach and longtime Eagles player, Aaron Schneekloth. On July 20, the Eagles announced a four-year affiliation with the NHL's Colorado Avalanche and the AHL's San Antonio Rampage after one season of playing independent of affiliations. In their first season with the Avalanche affiliation, the Eagles would go on to finish second in the Mountain Division of the ECHL and then win the Kelly Cup as the 2017 playoffs champions. In their last season in the ECHL in 2017–18, the Eagles finished with back-to-back Kelly Cups with the 2018 playoff championship. Traditionally, the Kelly Cup is held by the winning team during the following season and returned before the playoffs, but the Eagles did not return the trophy to the league after leaving for the AHL and it had to be replaced. They eventually sent it to the 2019 ECHL champion Newfoundland Growlers before opening night of the 2019–20 ECHL season.\n\nFor the 2017–18 season, the National Hockey League added the Vegas Golden Knights as a 31st team. The approval of a new NHL team also led to discussions of adding a 31st team in the American Hockey League. With the Golden Knights choosing to affiliate with the Chicago Wolves instead of adding their own AHL expansion team, talks with other organizations were opened. The owners and managers of the Eagles began discussions with the Avalanche with interests into becoming an AHL expansion for the 2018–19 season. On October 10, 2017, the Avalanche and the Eagles officially announced that the club would be promoted to the AHL in 2018.\n\nThe Avalanche hired Greg Cronin as the Eagles' first AHL head coach and retained former head coach Aaron Schneekloth as an assistant.\n\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, OTL = Overtime losses, SOL=shootout losses, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, PIM = Penalties in minutes\"\n\n<br>\n\nRay Miron President's Cup \"CHL playoff champion\"\n\nKelly Cup \"ECHL playoff champion\"\n\nBud Poile Governors' Cup\n\nConference playoff championship\n\nDivision titles\n\n"}

They are best known for their hit single, \"Wherever You Will Go\", which topped the Adult Top 40 for 23 weeks, making it the second longest running number one in the chart’s history and later named the number one song of the decade of 2000s on the Adult Pop Charts by \"Billboard\" magazine. Their debut album \"Camino Palmero\" was released in July 2001 and was a commercial success.\n\nTheir second album \"Two\", was released in June 2004. Its lead single \"Our Lives\" was featured in the closing ceremonies of the 2004 Summer Olympics as well as the opening song of the 78th annual Academy Awards.\n\nThe band broke up in 2005. In 2013, The Calling reformed with a new lineup and have announced new music to be released in 2018.\n\nThe band was formed by Alex Band (lead vocals) and Aaron Kamin (lead guitar, backing vocals) when Kamin was dating Band's sister. Kamin and Band initially began jamming and writing songs as far back as 1996, and began gigging under the band name \"Generation Gap\" with a drummer who was twice their age. At this stage, the band also included saxophonist Benny Golbin, giving the songs a more jazzy sound reminiscent of Dave Matthews Band. Eventually, Band and Kamin ditched the \"Gap\" lineup, and briefly switched their name to \"Next Door\", which itself was a nod to Ron Fair, a veteran music business executive and Band's neighbor.\n\nThey quickly found their own sound amongst radio rock acts of the early 21st century such as Matchbox Twenty, Third Eye Blind, Train, and Fastball. By 1999, Fair was impressed enough by the demos to sign them to a record deal with RCA. They changed their name to \"The Calling\", which reflected the band's sense of purpose.\n\nWhile the RCA deal was a huge boost, it also created a new problem for Band and Kamin: they had no solid band and, thus, had hardly toured and built a fanbase. Rather than putting them out on the road and building regional support, Fair worked intensely with Band and Kamin for over two years perfecting the debut album. The Calling's first album was recorded from 1999–2001, with Sean Woolstenhulme (formerly with Lifehouse) (rhythm guitar), Billy Mohler (bass), and Nate Wood (drums). The Calling's first album, \"Camino Palmero\", was issued in July 2001 and quickly became a hit due to the strength of its single, \"Wherever You Will Go\", which was named the No. 1 Adult Pop song of the decade by \"Billboard\" magazine. The song was featured prominently in the television series \"Smallville's\" first-season episode \"Metamorphosis\". It was also featured in the 2000 film \"Coyote Ugly\" with the group performing in the background in the first club scene, and in early trailers in 2001 for the \"Star Trek\" prequel series \"\". In an episode of the CBS television drama \"Cold Case\", \"Frank's Best\", the song is played at the end of the episode. \"Camino Palmero\" ultimately sold more than five million copies worldwide and was certified gold in the United States.\n\nIn June 2002, Woolstenhulme left The Calling. His replacement was Dino Meneghin. Mohler and Wood left in October 2002. In November 2003, former members Wood and Mohler sued Band, Kamin, and the group's management, accusing them of mismanagement, fraud, and asking for an audit of the money that was spent during their tenures in The Calling. They claimed that they were promised a share of the royalties and profits from touring and merchandise. Band and Kamin claimed that the two were not entitled to any records of the royalties.\n\nIn June 2004, the group returned with \"Two\". The album had three singles and accompanying videos: \"Our Lives\", \"Things Will Go My Way\", and \"Anything\". However, \"Two\" had disappointing sales compared to their first album.\n\nAfter a lengthy world tour in support of the album, Kamin and Band decided to disband The Calling. They played a farewell show in Temecula, California on June 6, 2005. Alex then began pursuing a solo career and played occasional shows.\n\nOn August 15, 2013, Alex Band reformed The Calling with new members. The band performed their comeback gig at Bally's Atlantic City on August 17. On August 18, Band was reportedly abducted by two men that robbed him, beat him severely, and dumped him on train tracks in Lapeer, Michigan. He was taken to an emergency room at a nearby hospital, where he was treated and released. After only a few shows, the group broke up again.\n\nIn October 2016 The Calling with a new lineup performed in Manila, Philippines the following month. The Australian company \"\"Unbreakable Touring\"\" announced that the band were to perform in areas such as Adelaide, Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Fremantle along with the rock band Juke Kartel and newcomer Mike Waters, but this was later postponed due to visa issues. In July 2017 it was announced that The Calling would be joining Lifehouse as support acts for Live's Australian leg of their world reunion tour.\n\nBand said in an interview with Australian music website \"may the rock be with you\" in November 2017 that The Calling will be releasing new music soon.\n\nThe band has cited that their influences include bands such as Pearl Jam, Bon Jovi, Live, Train, and U2.\n\n\n"}

In 2017, the team suspended operations after failing to find a new owner.\n\nIn 1996, the Columbus Cottonmouths started play in the Central Hockey League, joining the Macon Whoopee and Nashville Nighthawks as expansion entries that were originally slated to be in the Southern Hockey League before its demise in the summer of 1996. Along with the Memphis RiverKings, an established CHL franchise, and the Huntsville Channel Cats, the SHL champion in 1996 and the lone surviving franchise from that league, Columbus and the other two expansion SHL teams formed the new Eastern Division of the CHL in the 1996–97 season. In 1998, the team won the CHL championship, defeating the Wichita Thunder in a four-game sweep. The Cottonmouths were in the CHL playoffs each of their five seasons in the league, making it to the league finals in 2000 and 2001 before losing to the Indianapolis Ice and the Oklahoma City Blazers, respectively. In the summer of 2001, the CHL merged with the Western Professional Hockey League and geographic rivals in Huntsville and Macon were lost, leading the Cottonmouths to seek and obtain entry into the East Coast Hockey League.\n\nDVA Sports, composed of owners Salvador Diaz-Verson and Shelby Amos, purchased the defunct Hampton Roads Admirals ECHL franchise, relocating it to Columbus under the Cottonmouths name.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2004, the Columbus Cottonmouths organization played in the ECHL, bringing with them their longtime captain Jerome \"Boom-Boom\" Bechard and head coach Bruce Garber. In the three seasons that Columbus spent in the ECHL, they failed to make the playoffs. Midway through their second season in the ECHL, Garber, the only coach in team history, resigned. General manager Phil Roberto took over for the remainder of the season. Their best season in the ECHL was their last. Prior to the 2003–04 season the team announced the signing of their new coach, former NHL enforcer Brian Curran. They finished with a 37–27–8 record, tied with the Greensboro Generals for the best record by a non-playoff team that season.\n\nIn April 2004, the Cottonmouths management announced their intentions to move their ECHL franchise to the Bradenton-Sarasota area in Florida. The team, which was later named the Gulf Coast Swords, would never come to fruition as financial setbacks delayed the construction of their to-be home arena. Finally, after foreclosure on the arena property and numerous delays, the ECHL revoked the Swords franchise in the league in the summer of 2006.\n\nIn 2004, the Columbus Cottonmouths organization joined the Southern Professional Hockey League as one of its inaugural members. Led by first year coach, and Columbus hockey legend Jerome Bechard, the team won the first SPHL championship in April 2005 by first winning a one-game playoff against the Fayetteville FireAntz by a 4–2 score. They next swept the regular season champion Knoxville Ice Bears to advance to the league finals, which they won against the Macon Trax with two straight victories, ending with a 3–2 overtime win. The Snakes' victory capped an undefeated postseason in which they won five games.\n\nIn 2007, the Columbus team won the SPHL Commissioner's Cup as the team with the best season record, but was ousted in the first round of playoffs by the Jacksonville Barracudas, who won the series three games to one. In 2008, the Snakes' 22–24–6 regular-season record was a Columbus hockey team's first losing record since 2002–03 and the first one by a non-ECHL team.\n\nOn April 14, 2012, the Cottonmouths won their second President's Cup championship with a two-game sweep of the Pensacola Ice Flyers. The Snakes won game one 3–2 at home and then completed the championship series with a 3–1 road victory over the Ice Flyers. The Cottonmouths went undefeated in the playoffs, 6–0.\n\nOn January 19, 2017, the bus carrying the Cottonmouths was involved in a rollover on I-74 on the way to play the Peoria Rivermen. 24 players and staff were injured in the accident. In March 2017, it was announced that owners Wanda and Shelby Amos were selling the team and that general manager and head coach Bechard was in charge of looking for a buyer. The Amos' cited mounting financial losses as their reason for trying to sell the team and that they would cease operations if a new buyer is not found. On May 3, 2017, the team official suspended operations for the 2017–18 season. However, SPHL commissioner Jim Combs confirmed that negotiations with a potential ownership were still on-going but would only be ready for the 2018–19 season if the ownership transfer was successful. In June, the new potential ownership was confirmed as Residential World Media, headed by Fidel Jenkins, and that the purchase was still in negotiations with the SPHL. However, it was also stated that the Cottonmouths branding would not be included in the purchase and would instead be called the Columbus Burn. In August, the league terminated the application of the Burn to join the league.\n\nIn 2019, professional hockey returned to Columbus in the Federal Hockey League with the Columbus River Dragons.\n\n\n"}

They currently play in the Southern Professional Hockey League (SPHL) and play their home games in the Crown Coliseum.\n\nThe team, originally known as the Cape Fear FireAntz, began play in the Atlantic Coast Hockey League in the 2002–03 season. After the league's collapse, they joined the South East Hockey League for the 2003–04 season and then what would become the SPHL in 2004 as the Fayetteville FireAntz. Since their inception, they have won the 2007 SPHL championship and made a number of playoff appearances.\n\nThe team, then known as the Cape Fear FireAntz, joined the fledgling Atlantic Coast Hockey League for the 2002–03 season. Their first coach was Shawn Ulrich. After the season David Waronker announced he was withdrawing his four teams from the unstable league to form the World Hockey Association 2. The FireAntz and other remaining ACHL teams formed the South East Hockey League. They played the SEHL for the 2003–04 season, with Scott Rex serving as coach.\n\nIn 2004, teams from the SEHL and WHA2 joined together to form the league now known as the Southern Professional Hockey League. The FireAntz joined the new league, changing their name to Fayetteville FireAntz, abandoning the reference to the nearby Cape Fear River. Derek Booth took over as head coach in 2004 and after two seasons behind the bench, he left to coach the Bloomington Prairie Thunder of the United Hockey League.\n\nIn the 2006–07 season, under the guidance of head coach John Marks, the FireAntz advanced to the finals of the league's post-season playoffs for the first time in team history. The first two games of the best-of-five finals were won by Fayetteville on the FireAntz' home ice, before the series returned to Jacksonville, Florida, where the Jacksonville Barracudas won game three of the series by a 3-2 score. The FireAntz won the fourth game of the series by a score of 5-3 to win the President's Cup. It was the first championship for the FireAntz, and Fayetteville's first professional sports championship in 51 years. Head coach Marks resigned after the team's championship run to take the head coach position with the Pensacola Ice Pilots of the ECHL. Shortly after Marks' resignation the FireAntz announced that former Florida Seals coach, Tommy Stewart, had been hired to coach the team for the 2007–2008 season.\n\nTommy Stewart was let go after the 2010–11 season and was soon replaced by Rio Grande Valley Killer Bees' assistant coach, Sean Gillam. Gillam would only last partway through the season; on February 17, 2012, the FireAntz replaced him with Todd Bidner.\n\nMark DeSantis was hired prior to the 2012–13 season. He led the team to regular season record in the league and won William B. Coffey Trophy and the SPHL's Coach of the Year. However, he left the team after only one season to become the head coach of an expansion team in his hometown, the Brampton Beast.\n\nGreg McCauley was then hired to replace DeSantis for the 2013–14 season but resigned for personal reasons after 32 games. He was replaced by Emery Olauson, who was then kept on until the end of the 2014–15 season.\n\nOn May 26, 2015, Jeff Bes was hired as the head coach prior to the 2015–16 season.\n\nOn February 13, 2017, Jeffrey M. Longo was hired as the general manager. Later in the 2016–17 season, Longo and local entrepreneur Chuck Norris purchased the FireAntz from the seven-person ownership group, Cape Fear Pro Hockey. At the end of the season, the new owners changed the name of the FireAntz to the Fayetteville Marksmen. The change reflects the city of Fayetteville's relationship with the local United States Army post, Fort Bragg, as well as the native Carolina red fox.\n\nIn June 2017, head coach Jeff Bes decided to not re-sign with the team to be closer to his family. He was replaced by Nick Mazzolini but only lasted until November 23 when he was replaced by Phil Esposito, the recent head coach of the Watertown Wolves. Esposito would also last less than season and was relieved of duties on February 21, 2018, after a 5–19–4 record and in last place in the SPHL. John Bierchen took over as head coach on an interim basis for the remainder of the season. The Marksmen then hired Jesse Kallechy as the permanent head coach for the 2018–19 season.\n\n"}

It is Western Australia's largest maternity hospital and only referral centre for complex pregnancies.\n\nIt provides pregnancy and neonatal care within the greater Perth Metropolitan area. In cases where patients have gone to private maternity clinics, they may be moved to KEMH if complications occur. All cases of complicated pregnancy in Western Australia are transferred to KEMH by the Royal Flying Doctor Service.\n\nIn 1909, a meeting was convened in Perth by the Women's Service Guilds to discuss the establishment of a new maternity hospital. At the time in Perth, there were only a few private maternity clinics, and charitable organizations providing services to the poor, but no dedicated public maternity hospital facilities. The main outcome of the 1909 meeting was to appoint a committee to pursue the matter, jointly chaired by Edith Cowan and Jane Scott. Between 1910 and 1915 the committee wrangled with the government and raised funds to support the establishment of a hospital. Plans were suggested for building an extra ward at the Perth Public Hospital, or as an adjunct to the Home of Mercy in Lincoln Street, but eventually the site of the Industrial School in Subiaco was chosen.\n\nThe hospital was named the King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women as a lasting memorial to King Edward VII, who died in 1910. The hospital commenced operating on 14 July 1916. 101 babies were born in the first 6 months of operation. At the time, the hospital charged a standard fee of £3 3s for 'confinement' and fourteen days of post-natal care. Agnes Marion Walsh was head matron from 1922 until 1954 and oversaw the birth of more than 60,000 babies.\n\nIn 1994 the organisational structure for King Edward Memorial Hospital and the Princess Margaret Hospital for Children were integrated, although separate locations were maintained. In 2002 the organisation was renamed Women's and Children's Health Service. In 2006, the two hospitals were once again separated. King Edward Memorial Hospital is now home of the state's Women and Newborn Health Service, as part of the North Metropolitan Health Service.\n\nKEMH is a tertiary maternity hospital, and provides general maternity for women in its catchment area, as well as handling complex pregnancies from across the state. KEMH has Australia's first milk bank, as well as a comprehensive inpatient service for women suffering from postnatal psychiatric disorders. KEMH also specialises in women's health, and treats over 5,000 patients with gynaecological conditions every year. KEMH is also involved in the training of student doctors and other health professionals.\n\nIn addition, KEMH hosts a number of statewide services as part of the WA Women and Newborn Health Service, including:\n\n"}

They play their home games at the Von Braun Center in downtown Huntsville, Alabama.\n\nThe team began play in the 2004–05 season, following the defunct Huntsville Channel Cats of the South East Hockey League. The team finished sixth out of eight teams in the regular season in 2004–05 and lost a one-game playoff to the Jacksonville Barracudas. In 2006, Huntsville finished fifth in the league and was defeated two games to none by the Florida Seals in the second round of playoffs after knocking off the defending league champion Columbus Cottonmouths in three games in the opening round. In 2007, Huntsville's fourth-place regular season finish was for naught as they were swept out of the playoffs by the eventual league champion Fayetteville FireAntz.\n\nIn 2008, the Havoc finished last in the SPHL standings and were the only team left out of the league playoffs. Immediately following the conclusion of the season, the team announced it would not renew the contract of head coach John Gibson, who had led the Havoc through all four SPHL seasons, coached the SEHL Channel Cats to the league championship in 2004, and was an All-Star defenseman for the CHL version of the Channel Cats. Eric Soltys was named head coach of the team for the 2008–09 season with Paul Snell serving as his assistant. In the 2008–09 SPHL season the Havoc finished in fourth place. In the 2009 SPHL Playoffs the Havoc was beaten in the first round by the eventual SPHL champions (Knoxville Ice Bears) in 5 games (5 game series). With Randy Murphy taking over coaching duties in 2009–10, the Havoc finished season play in second place, earning a team-record 71 points. The Havoc entered the SPHL playoffs as the #2 seed. In round 1 Huntsville defeated the Pensacola Ice Flyers 2 games to 1. In round 2 the Havoc swept the Knoxville Ice Bears. The Havoc then went on to sweep the Mississippi Surge in the finals, winning their first SPHL President's Cup. In the 2010–11 season, the Havoc finished 3rd in the regular season and lost in the first round of the playoffs to Columbus.\n\nIn the 2018 SPHL playoffs, the fourth-seeded Havoc defeated the Mississippi RiverKings in the Challenge Round 2-game-to-1, the Macon Mayhem in the semifinals 2-games-to-1, and the top-seeded Peoria Rivermen 2-games-to-1 in the finals to claim the franchise's second President's Cup. It was the first time in league history that a fourth-seeded team won the championship.\n\nIn 2019, the Huntsville Havoc repeated as SPHL President's Cup Champions by defeating the Birmingham Bulls 2-games-to-0 in the finals. \n\nThe following numbers were retired by the Huntsville Channel Cats.

After finishing as runner-up to the Orlando Seals in the 2002–03 season, the Ice Bears moved to the new South East Hockey League. Again, they finished as a runner-up in the playoffs to the Huntsville Channel Cats for 2003–04. In 2004, the team again changed hockey leagues and joined the new Southern Professional Hockey League. In the SPHL's first season, the Ice Bears won the regular season championship Commissioner's Cup, but lost in the second round of the playoffs (after a first round bye) to the eventual champions, the Columbus Cottonmouths.\n\nIn 2005–06, the Ice Bears secured the Commissioner's Cup and the President's Cup by beating the Florida Seals in game four of a best-of-five series. In 2006–07, the team was eliminated in the league semifinals with two straight losses to the Fayetteville FireAntz. In 2007–08, the Ice Bears once again secured the Commissioner's Cup, now renamed the William B. Coffey Trophy. In the 2008 President's Cup playoffs, the Ice Bears won again. Rookie goalie Kirk Irving took home playoff MVP honors. The President Cup title was the Ice Bears' second in three years.\n\nIn 2008–09, the Ice Bears again won the William B. Coffey Trophy.

In the third period with the Ice Bears winning 5–3, few players remained. The Ice Bears then took a 9–4 lead. The game was declared a forfeit at 10:45 of the third period, as the FireAntz had two skaters remaining after several FireAntz players intentionally drew penalties so their team would not have enough players remaining to play the rest of the game. There were a total of 26 games in suspensions handed out between all the ejected players.\n\nIn the 2009–10 season, the Ice Bears finished fourth out of seven teams. They went to the playoffs to face the FireAntz in a best-of-three series in the first round. The Ice Bears' back-to-back regular season and league championship run came to an end on April 9, 2010, when they were defeated 3–1 in game two by the eventual playoff champions, the Huntsville Havoc.\n\nAfter the 2009–10 season, Ice Bears' star and SPHL all-time leading scorer Kevin Swider retired. On July 12, 2010, Swider was named Ice Bears' director of hockey operations and youth hockey school director. Swider won every scoring title from 2004 to 2010, all six years of the SPHL's existence to that point. Swider came out of retirement in the summer of 2011.

In 2017, Swider was inducted into the Greater Knoxville Sports Hall of Fame for his repeated scoring titles in the SPHL.\n\nOn June 29, 2010, head coach Marc Rodgers and the Ice Bears parted ways. It was not clear if Rodgers was fired or resigned.\n\nOn August 2, 2010, the Ice Bears introduced Mike Craigen as the new head coach. Craigen, a Buckhorn, Ontario, Canada native was a former Ice Bears player from 2004 to 2008. He was a part of Knoxville's 2006 and 2008 President's Cup Championship teams. The 2010–11 season saw the Ice Bears finish sixth out of eight teams.\n\nOn October 9, 2012, the team announced that they had partnered with the NHL's Nashville Predators to host a preseason game against Huntsville, at Bridgestone Arena, the Predators home ice, on October 20. The event was free to all Ice Bears season ticket holders.\n\nOn April 18, 2015, the Ice Bears won their fourth Presidents Cup, ending a six-year drought. Ice Bears' goalie Bryan Hince took home the SPHL Playoffs MVP Award after winning his last five starts in the playoffs and allowing less than two goals per game.\n\nOn May 15, 2017, the team opted to not renew coach Mike Craigen's contract.

The combined chain has the largest base of stores that operate in New England, but is the third-largest New England-based grocer behind Quincy, Massachusetts-based Stop & Shop and Scarborough, Maine-based Hannaford; Hannaford operates stores in upstate New York, while Stop & Shop's operations extend through downstate New York and into New Jersey; only Shaw's does business solely in New England.\n\nAs of July 5, 2013, Shaw's and Star Market no longer use loyalty cards at their stores, as a way to compete with other local stores that do not have them.\n\nIn 1860, George C. Shaw opened a small teashop in Portland, Maine. Meanwhile, Maynard A. Davis established a group of small downtown grocery stores in Brockton and New Bedford, Massachusetts, called the Brockton Public Market (BPM) food retailers. In 1919, Davis purchased the George C. Shaw Company and made it a subsidiary of BPM.\n\nAs George C. Shaw and BPM continued to grow, it was decided that a central warehouse would be needed for the two companies. In 1961, a warehouse in Brockton was purchased.\n\nBy 1965, George C. Shaw had begun to expand northward, into New Hampshire. This expansion, combined with BPM's growth in southern Massachusetts, moved the companies to build a distribution center in 1972 in East Bridgewater, Massachusetts. In the 1980s, a warehouse was built in Wells, Maine, and in January 1991, Shaw's opened a distribution facility for perishable food items in Methuen, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1978, BPM stores in Massachusetts became Shaw's Supermarkets, Inc. to maximize advertising. It was the first step towards merging the two companies.\n\nIn November 1983, J Sainsbury plc, then the UK's largest supermarket group, purchased 21% of Shaw's outstanding stock. In June 1987, Sainsbury's acquired controlling interest.\n\nJ Sainsbury plc acquired stores from four New England food retailers: Iandoli's (1987), Cerretani's (1993), Star Market (1999) and Butson's (2003).\n\nIn 1995, Shaw's entered Connecticut, opening five stores. The next year, Sainsbury purchased 12 former Edwards supermarkets and two future sites from Royal Ahold.\n\nIn 1999, Shaw's made its largest acquisition by acquiring the Star Market chain. Star Market had been owned by Investcorp, which in turn purchased the chain from American Stores in 1994. American Stores had acquired Star Market through its hostile takeover of Jewel Companies, Inc. in 1984 and Jewel had acquired Star Market in 1964. The acquisition strengthened Shaw's position as the second-largest supermarket company in New England. Like Shaw's, the Star Market Company had humble beginnings, and many \"firsts\" in the supermarket industry. Star was the first New England supermarket to have air-conditioned stores, the touch method of ringing registers, in-store check verification, refrigerated cooked foods, self-service wrapped meats, and packaged produce.\n\nIn November 1999, J Sainsbury/Shaw's Supermarkets closed the Star Market Distribution Center in Norwood, laying off over 300 Local 25 Teamster members. In May 1999 Local 25 agreed to a 6-month extension with J Sainsbury/Shaw's Supermarkets on the then-prevailing contract to bargain in \"good faith\". In 2001, J Sainsbury/Shaw's Supermarkets closed the Shaw's Distribution Center in East Bridgewater, laying off over 400 UFCW members. J Sainsbury/Shaw's Supermarkets indicated that the warehouse was \"not centrally located in its service area, and the necessary physical expansion is impossible\". C&S Wholesale Grocers does the majority of the work that was performed by the two union-based distribution centers. C&S's distribution center/headquarters were in Brattleboro, Vermont at the time.\n\nIn 2004, J Sainsbury sold Shaw's to Albertsons for US$2.48 billion. On June 2, 2006, a partnership of SuperValu, CVS Corporation, and several investment firms, including Cerberus Capital, acquired Albertsons with the intent to divvy up the parts. SuperValu received what was generally thought of as the best-performing assets, including Shaw's and Star Market, along with regional chains including ACME (Philadelphia); Jewel, and Jewel-Osco (Chicago). However, Shaw's was beset by store closings almost yearly between 2006 and 2011 during its acquisition by SuperValu. At its 2006 peak, Shaw's operated more than 200 stores in New England, however, Shaw's footprint has been reduced except in Vermont, and has pulled out of Connecticut altogether.\n\nThe first round of closings was announced in late August 2006, when Shaw's announced it would be closing six in October. These stores were in New Britain, Southington, and Bridgeport, Connecticut; and in Worcester and New Bedford, Massachusetts. In September 2007, Shaw's closed its stores in Providence and Pawtucket, Rhode Island; and Waterbury, Connecticut, because of poor sales. The closings left Shaw's with 204 stores. A total of 224 workers were laid off or transferred.\n\nOn July 25, 2009, Shaw's closed its Bristol and Shelton, Connecticut stores. In early 2009, Shaw's had closed stores in Gorham, New Hampshire, and Bangor, Maine. The largest round of closings was in 2010; Shaw's announced in February that it would sell or close its 18 remaining Connecticut stores. Eleven of those were sold to New Jersey-based Wakefern, operator of ShopRite and PriceRite supermarkets; and 5 to Stop & Shop. One of the remaining two ultimately also became a Stop & Shop, while the other was subdivided for a Supervalu-owned Save-A-Lot. In addition to the store closures, in late March 2010, Shaw's eliminated about 4% of its full-time workforce, which amounted to nearly 650 jobs spread out over the about 120 non-union stores.\n\nA recent round of closings was in early 2011; on January 5, Shaw's announced that three Massachusetts and two Rhode Island stores that were unprofitable would close by February 17. After the closures, Shaw's was left with 169 stores.\n\nIn November 2012, Shaw's and its then-parent company, SuperValu, announced that Shaw's would lay off 700 employees in an effort to re-group and end financial losses. It also disclosed it had been looking for a buyer.\n\nIn January 2013, Cerberus Capital Management announced a deal to acquire 877 stores in the Albertsons, ACME, Jewel-Osco, and Shaw's and Star Market chains from SuperValu for $100 million and acquisition of $3.2 billion on SuperValu debt. The deal closed on March 21, 2013.\n\nAccording to their website, as of January 2018, Shaw's and Star Market operated a total of 154 locations: 79 in Massachusetts (21 as Star Market), 8 in Rhode Island, 19 in Vermont, 27 in New Hampshire, and 21 in Maine. This is compared to January 2010, and shortly before the Connecticut stores were sold, Shaws operated 194 stores: 12 in Rhode Island, 18 in Connecticut, 19 in Vermont, 22 in Maine, 34 in New Hampshire, and 89 in Massachusetts (including 12 operating as Star Market at the time).\n\nShaw's store footprint extends (south to north) from the village of Wakefield in South Kingstown, Rhode Island to the Canada–US border in Derby, Vermont. Shaw's strongest presences are in Greater Boston (where its largest competitor is Stop & Shop) and throughout New Hampshire and Vermont (where its largest competitor is Hannaford).\n\nAmidst the closings, SuperValu remodeled and updated many Shaw's stores, which has continued under Albertsons ownership. In late 2010, SuperValu introduced a newly redesigned website for Shaw's; the website design is shared with sister store Jewel-Osco. Shaw's also, during that time, increased their marketing efforts, partnering with the New England Patriots and the Boston Red Sox Radio Network as their \"official supermarket\", airing advertisements frequently on New England radio stations, and maintaining a Facebook page with more than 93,000 fans.\n\nIn December 2013, plans were announced for a new Star Market store in the city of Boston at the site of the Boston Garden redevelopment. The store will be the first new Shaw's or Star Market store to be opened in four years. While this project has yet to be completed, in July 2017, Shaw's announced the opening of a new store in Hudson, Massachusetts, replacing a former Hannaford. The Hudson store is the first new Shaw's store to open in nearly a decade, and marks its first expansion under Albertsons ownership.\n\nAlso under Albertsons recent ownership, several Shaw's stores in the immediate Boston area were remodeled and re-opened as Star Markets, with the idea of increasing the number of locations of that brand to a possible 30 over the next few years. As of March 2014, four stores had made the switch, which brought the total number of Star Market stores to 18. As of January 2018, there were 21 Star Market stores.\n\nBefore it was acquired by Shaw's, Star Market Company had been part of Jewel Companies, and while Jewel owned Star it built many combination food-drug stores branded as \"Star-Osco\", with common checkstands but separate management teams. While it owned Star, Jewel also built many stand-alone Osco Drug stores in New England. After Jewel was acquired by American Stores in 1984, the Star-Osco stores were re-launched as Star Markets, and placed under a single management team. In 1999, Albertsons acquired American Stores, and in 2001, Albertsons sold its 80 New England Osco Drug locations to Jean Coutu group, which added them to its Brooks Pharmacy group. When American Stores sold Star Markets in 1994 to Investcorp, the Osco connection was ended, or so it seemed.\n\nWhen Albertsons bought Sainsbury's American supermarket assets in 2004, including Star Markets, Star and Osco were reunited under one corporate umbrella. By 2005, the signs on the front of all of Albertsons-owned grocery stores with in-store pharmacies were changed, adding either \"Osco\" or \"Sav-On\" to the stores' logos, to emphasize the one-stop shopping available inside. The drug store name chosen reflected which of Albertsons' drug chains operated in the specific marketing area. Because New England had previously been an Osco market area, the Shaws and Star Market stores with pharmacies were renamed \"Shaws-Osco\" and \"Star-Osco\". As of January 2018, Osco Pharmacy has 55 locations within Shaws and Star Market stores.\n\nShaw's and Star Market has gradually acquired brands, including:\n\n\nSuperValu announced in May 2011, that its national brand equivalent products (including Shaw's) would be renamed \"Essential Everyday\" in line with its plans to phase out own-brand products carrying the names of its banners nationwide. Some of these private label products are now produced by Richelieu Foods.\n\n"}

They play in Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin, at the Resch Center.\n\nThe first professional hockey team to be based in Green Bay was the Green Bay Bobcats who started playing in 1958 when the Brown County Veterans Memorial Arena was built. There is some confusion over what league the team played in during its early years or if the team played in multiple leagues. Some sources cite that the Bobcats played in the U.S. Central Hockey League, a predecessor to the current United States Hockey League (USHL). Other sources claim that the Bobcats did not start playing in the USCHL until 1961. The Green Bay Bobcats franchise folded after the 1980-1981 season and 23 years of play. However, since the 2008-2009 season the Green Bay Gamblers have used a yellow bobcat prominently in the teams logo as well as having a bobcat by the name of \"Ace\" as the teams mascot.\n\nSince their inception into the United States Hockey League in 1994 the Green Bay Gamblers have been one of the premiere junior \"A\" hockey franchises in all of North America. To their credit the Gamblers have won two Junior A, Tier 2 National Championships (Gold Cups in 1996 and 1997), five Anderson Cups (1996, 1997, 2009, 2010, and 2012), four Clark Cups (1996, 2000, 2010, and 2012), four USHL Eastern Division titles, and one USHL Northern Division title. Since the USHL became Tier 1 in 2002, the Clark Cup also represents that level's national championship.\n\nFrom when the Gamblers entered the league at the start of the 1994-1995 season through the 2001-2002 season, the team's primary venue was at the Brown County Veterans Memorial Arena. For the start of the 2002-2003 season, the Gamblers moved into the Resch Center, an 8,800 seat arena which was built on the opposite side of Shopko Hall. The team played at the Memorial Arena a few times each season due to scheduling conflicts with the Resch Center until the arena was scheduled for demolition in 2019.\n\nDuring the years at the Arena, other venues were sometimes used due to scheduling conflicts. These include the De Pere Ice & Recreation Center, the Brown County Youth Hockey Arena, the Cornerstone Community Center, Fond du Lac's Blue Line Ice Center, Beaver Dam Ice Arena, Greenheck Ice Center in Schofield.\n\nSince 1994 the average attendance of a Gamblers Game is 3,353 people, which is among the top in the USHL. In 2010, the Green Bay Gamblers set a USHL record for the highest attended playoff game when 8,487 fans showed up to see game five of the USHL Playoff championship, a game the Gamblers won resulting in franchise's third Clark Cup. The record has since been broken multiple times.\n\nReference\n\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime losses, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, PIM = Penalties in minutes\"\n\n\nOn March 25, 2013, former Gamblers head coach Jon Cooper was named the head coach of the Tampa Bay Lightning.

O'Handley. The Black Hawks' home ice is the Young Arena in Waterloo, Iowa.\n\nThe Waterloo Black Hawks began as a semi-professional team in the USHL in 1962. The league had been renamed prior to the season after beginning in 1948 as the American Amateur Hockey League. The team's home ice was the McElroy Auditorium. The team won the USHL championship consecutively between the seasons of 1964 and 1968. After the 1968–69 season, the Black Hawks went on a one-year hiatus to become the Minnesota North Stars' top farm team, the Iowa Stars. The Stars finished 35–26–11 in 1969–70, one point behind league champion Omaha (whom the Stars would later lose to in the Central Professional Hockey League final series). The Stars reverted to the Black Hawks and the USHL the next year amid financial losses topping $150,000 and the Stars move to Cleveland.\n\nAfter league titles in 1978, and '79, the Black Hawks converted to junior hockey with the rest of the USHL in 1979. They won the Southern Division title in 1979-80 before head coach Jack Barzee moved the team to Dubuque the next season, becoming the Fighting Saints in the process. The Hennepin Nordiques then moved to Waterloo before the 1980-81 campaign. The \"new\" Black Hawks retained the history, logos, and arena of the old team.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1992, following the retirement of head coach Scott Mikesch, the team went through eight different head coaches. Five of them coached between 1980 and 1982. After the team's Southern Division title in 1980, the Black Hawks did not have a winning season again until 1993–94, winning 20 games (in a 48-game season) four times during that span.\n\nThe Black Hawks turned out several future National Hockey League (NHL) players in the early 1990s. Twin leading forwards Chris Ferraro and Peter Ferraro came over from Dubuque midway through the 1991-1992 season and scored a combined 200 points in total from their time that year in Waterloo and Dubuque. Two seasons later, Jason Blake had 50 goals and 50 assists, the first 50-goal, 50-assist player in the USHL since Thunder Bay's Terry Menard seven years prior.\n\nIn 1994, the Black Hawks moved out of the old McElroy Auditorium into the new Young Arena in downtown Waterloo. New owner Butch Johnson's purchased the team in 1997. The records did not improve, and the team failed to finish above .500 again until 1999-2000. New head coach Scott Pionk in 1997-98 had a 25-29-2 record, but a 16-37-3 record the next season led to his departure. Scott Koberinski had a 28-26-4 record in 1999-2000, followed by a 25-29-2 record the next year, but a 21-38-2 record led to another coaching change.\n\nNew coach P.K. O'Handley brought immediate changes to the Black Hawks landscape in 2002-03, and Waterloo won their first division championship in 23 years with a 38-17-5 record and finishing two points behind the Lincoln Stars in the Anderson Cup race. The next season brought the Hawks' first USHL Clark Cup championship win, and the first league title of any kind since 1979, despite finishing 4th in the Eastern Division. Once again, O'Handley's leadership brought a title in 2007, this time the Anderson Cup, the first-ever regular season title for the Black Hawks in the junior era. The team was one game away from winning the 2007 Clark Cup, before they were beaten 3-0 by the Sioux Falls Stampede in the championship game, and in the 2008 Clark Cup Finals lost 4-3 to the Omaha Lancers in overtime in the final game of the series. Waterloo was edged again in a five-game finals series by the Green Bay Gamblers in 2012 and once more in 2014 by the Indiana Ice. However, the Hawks did celebrate additional Anderson Cups in 2013–14 and 2017–18.\n\nOf the 28 Black Hawks alumni who have gone on to appear in the NHL, 19 played for O'Handley, including Joe Pavelski, Vinnie Hinostroza, and Brock Boeser. In the 2019 NHL Entry Draft, forwards Vladislav Firstov (42nd) and Matej Blumel (100th) were drafted to the Minnesota Wild and the Edmonton Oilers, respectively.\n\nThe Black Hawks won the USHL Organization of the Year award for the 2002-03, 2004–05, and 2006–07 seasons. At the time, the USHL said of the Black Hawks in 2007, \"Once a franchise in a state of disarray, the Waterloo Black Hawks are now among the teams that sets the standard for how a team should be run.\" P.K. O'Handley also won Coach of the Year honors for the 2002–03, 2006–07, 2013–14, and 2017–18 seasons and the General Manager of Year award for the 2002–03, 2011–12, 2017–18 seasons.\n\nThe Black Hawks have had ongoing rivalries with other USHL teams, including the current \"Corridor Cup\" rivalry with the Cedar Rapids RoughRiders. Other rivalries include a former rivalry with the old Dubuque Fighting Saints (which were the Black Hawks prior to 1980), a rivalry with the Sioux City Musketeers (the only teams left from the 1979 USHL transformation; the Des Moines Buccaneers were added to the league a year later), and the Buccaneers. During the 1990s, the Black Hawks - Buccaneers rivalry was not as active as it is now, with the Buccaneers' at the top of the league and the Black Hawks' lower down in the USHL's league tables. In 2010, the USHL saw the renewal of the rivalry between Dubuque and Waterloo. Dubuque took back the old name of the Dubuque Fighting Saints and renewed the rivalry between the two teams. Currently Waterloo shares a three-way rivalry with Dubuque and Cedar Rapids in the Dupaco Cowbell Cup.\n\nAmong the Black Hawks alumni in the National Hockey League:\n\n\n"}

It was the second major hydroelectric project undertaken on Newfoundland.\n\nThe hydroelectric potential of this area was known by the early 1920s but its development was not seriously considered until 1954 when British Newfoundland Development Corporation (BRINCO) became interested in the site. In 1957 a Shawinigan Engineering survey confirmed the feasibility of building a hydroelectric plant. By 1959 BRINCO had set up a subsidiary, Southern Newfoundland Power and Development Corporation, to carry out the project. However, the subsidiary was unable to attract industrial customers to the area; this, it felt, was necessary before undertaking the project, so in 1964 it sold all its rights and assets to the Newfoundland Government.\n\nThe government, by taking over the project, became eligible for a $20 million grant from the Atlantic Development Board a Federal Government agency. The engineering and construction work was carried out by ShawMont Newfoundland Engineering, a joint venture company formed by Shawinigan Engineering and Montreal Engineering in 1964.\n\nThe Bay D'Espoir Hydroelectric Development was undertaken to provide the province with a large source of low-cost electric power which would allow the Island's utilities to extend their services, stimulate the expansion of the industries already in the province and attract new industries to Newfoundland and Labrador. The Electric Reduction Company of Canada Industries Limited (ERCO), phosphorus plant at Long Harbour and the Come by Chance Oil Refinery at Come by Chance were built partially because of the availability of cheap power.\n\nUnits 1 through 4 went online between 1967 and 1968, with each unit having a rated capacity of 75 MW.\n\nGenerating unit 2 underwent a major refurbishment during the summer of 2010, including a stator rewind, rotor pole re-insulation and protection upgrade. This project was the first stator rewind on a unit of this size in Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro's history.\n\nThe headwaters of the Bay d'Espoir system begin at Victoria Lake at an approximate elevation of 320 metres. Through a man-made array of dams and canals, this water is directed to generating plants at Granite Canal, Upper Salmon and, finally, 150 km from Victoria Lake to its final tidewater destination at Bay d'Espoir. Water is collected, stored and diverted from a number of drainage areas between Victoria Lake and Long Pond, the forebay for the two Bay d'Espoir generating stations.\n\nThe seven generating units at Bay d'Espoir utilize approximately 176 m of head to produce a rated output of 604 MW with a rated flow of 397 m/s. The plant produces an average of 2,657 GWh annually, making it the largest hydroelectric plant on Newfoundland.\n\n"}

The Stampede are members of the Western Conference of the United States Hockey League (USHL). The team plays home games at the Denny Sanford Premier Center, the largest facility in capacity and size in the USHL. The team was established in 1999 and is owned by SD Sports and Entertainment, LLC. since 2012.\n\nThe Stampede have qualified for the Clark Cup playoffs in fifteen of twenty seasons. The team holds three Clark Cup championships, winning most recently in the 2018–19 season, two conference and one division championships, and was awarded the Anderson Cup in the 2005–06 season for the league's highest win percentage. The organization holds the USHL single-season attendance record at 200,597 fans over the 2015–16 season and are a five-time USHL organization of the year recipient. Thirty former players have skated in the National Hockey League (NHL).\n\nDiscussions began as early as 1994 to bring a United States Hockey League (USHL) expansion to the city of Sioux Falls. Expansion talks failed on three separate occasions, including a bid by Wisconsin Capitols owner Geoffrey Kelley to relocate to Sioux Falls, due to the city's failure to provide a permanent home and publicly-backed funds. The Minnehaha Ice and Recreation Center and Expo Ice Arena at the W.H. Lyon Fairgrounds were in contention to host the team, however, both lacked sufficient locker rooms or accommodations for fans to meet league demands. The Sioux Falls Arena was also presented as an option, but was written off due to poor sight lines and potential scheduling conflicts with other tenants.\n\nIn 1998, the Minnesota-based investment firm Central Ventures, Inc. expressed interest in adding a USHL team to the Sioux Falls sports landscape. The firm and local investment group Sioux Falls Sports, LLC. made an official proposal on January 26, 1998, to the league at its annual board of governors meeting held in Lincoln, Nebraska. Unlike other proposals, the investment firm was willing to help privately fund improvements at an existing facility or the construction of a new arena with help from the city.\n\nOn May 26, 1998, league president Gino Gasparini awarded Sioux Falls a franchise to begin play in September 1999. The city finalized a deal that would upgrade the existing Sioux Falls Arena for an estimated $1 million funded between the city and team. In choosing the team name, the ownership group set up a telephone line fans called to make suggestions. On September 30, 1998, after more than 140 name submissions were filed, the official name Stampede and American bison logo were unveiled to represent the new Sioux Falls franchise.\n\nOn October 7, 1998, former Miami University of Ohio associate coach Bob Motzko was named the inaugural head coach. Motzko had previously led the defunct North Iowa Huskies to the 1989 Junior A Championship and was an assistant to Herb Brooks at St. Cloud State University during the 1986–87 season. For Motzko, the plan was to \"win as fast as possible\" and recruit high-caliber players: \"You do not win in this league without veterans and our first year we might not have many veterans. But I want to get at it right away.\" Motzko would recruit several key players that played an instrumental role in the success that was to come, including forwards J.B. Bittner, Dave Iannazzo, Chad LaRose, Thomas Vanek, James Massen, Marty Sertich and Joe Jensen; defenseman Jamie Mattie; and goaltenders Zack Sikich and David Bowen.\n\nThe Stampede were placed in the Western Division and played their inaugural game at home against the Cedar Rapids RoughRiders on September 24, 1999, to a sold-out crowd of 4,660 fans, including an estimated 2,000 season ticket holders. The team completed its inaugural season 37–17–4, the highest for a first-year expansion, and qualified for a Clark Cup playoff match-up against the Twin Cities Vulcans. The team was led by forward Rick Gorman, who finished the season scoring 68 points, 25 goals and 43 assists. Motzko was named general manager of the year and Gorman was named to the all-USHL first team. The following season the team found similar success as it qualified for back-to-back playoff appearances with a 40–14–2 record. The Stampede beat the RoughRiders in the first round before losing to eventual Clark Cup champions, the Omaha Lancers. Following the season, coach Motzko left the Stampede to pursue an assistant coach role at the University of Minnesota.\n\nThe Stampede accumulated a 112–52–11 overall record in its first three years of operation; however, the team's top four scoring players from the previous season, including Vanek, would not return for the 2002–03 season. After 52 games, Coach Gasparini's 21–25–6 team was in the midst of a six-game losing streak and ranked last in goals allowed per game. The poor performance prompted the ownership group to relieve Gasparini from his coaching duties and appoint assistant coach Ted Belisle as interim head coach in an attempt to salvage the team's playoff chances. The team finished its remaining eight games 3–5–0. The Stampede failed to make the playoffs for the first time in franchise history with a 24–30–6 record while also accruing a total of 1404 penalty minutes, the most of any team that season. Belisle was not retained as head coach.\n\nOn April 21, 2003, the Stampede announced the hiring of former San Jose Sharks assistant coach Mark Kaufman as head coach for the 2003–04 season with the intent of making a more disciplined defensive team. However, the team suffered its worst season record to date, going 15–42–3. The following 2004–05 season allowed a franchise-high 252 goals over 60 games and the team failed to make the playoffs for the third consecutive season. The Stampede fired Kaufman on April 6, 2005, after posting a 42–70–8 record over two seasons.\n\nIn an attempt to reinvigorate the franchise, Sioux Falls hired former University of Minnesota player and St. Paul Vulcans head coach Kevin Hartzell for the 2005–06 season. Hartzell previously led the Vulcans to three Clark Cup final appearances, including a championship during the 1983–84 season, and posted a 195–83–8 record overall between 1983 and 1989.\n\nIn his first year with the team, Hartzell led the club to a 41–13–4 record, its only Anderson Cup title, awarded to the team with the league's highest regular-season win percentage, and first division championship. The team was led by future NHL players Andreas Nödl, Nate Prosser and Ryan Thang; and the goaltender tandem of John Murray and Alex Kangas. The Stampede defense finished first overall in the USHL and set a franchise record for fewest goals allowed in a season with 135. Seven players were selected for the 2006 USHL All-Star/Prospects game in Sioux City, Iowa, and the team swept the Tri-City Storm and defeated the Lincoln Stars before advancing to their first Clark Cup championship appearance. The club was defeated by the Des Moines Buccaneers in a best-of-five series, 3–2. The team ended the 2005–06 season with a franchise best 21–7–2 home record and 20–6–2 away record, including a franchise-high win streak of 16 games.\n\nReturning for Hartzell's third season were veteran forwards Nick Dineen, David Grun, Jake Hansen, Robbie Vrolyk and newcomer Jack Connolly, the seventh overall pick of the 2007 USHL Entry Draft. Finding similar success in previous seasons, Hartzell employed another goaltender tandem composed of his son, Eric Hartzell, and veteran Max Strang. The team finished the season 35–19–6, earning a third consecutive playoff berth, while Hartzell set a franchise-high five shutouts in the regular season. After sweeping the Lincoln Stars in the first round the previous season, the Stars returned the favor and shutout Sioux Falls 3–0. First-year forward Connolly led the league in scoring, finishing with 26 goals and 46 assists for 72 points. Connolly was named the 2007–08 season USHL Rookie of the Year and USA Hockey Player of the Year.\n\nDuring the 2008–09 season, the Stampede finished 28–28–4, qualified for the playoffs and was again defeated by the Lincoln Stars. The club was led by forwards Terry Broadhurst and David Eddy. The following season was matched with similar success as the team finished 33–25–12, but, for the third consecutive season, was knocked out of the playoffs in the first round. The club had one of the most potent offenses in team history, ranking fourth in goals for with 223. The offensive output was led by forwards Michael Voran and Matt Lindblad and defenseman Chad Ruhwedel. Goaltender Clay Witt recorded six regular season shutouts, breaking the record previously held by Hartzell two seasons prior.\n\nThe team's previous failure to move beyond the first round became a point of consternation among fans. After finishing the 2010–11 season 34–20–6, the Stampede defeated rival Sioux City Musketeers 2–1 and Omaha Lancers 3–0 and advanced to face the Dubuque Fighting Saints in the Western Conference Championship. The club found success in a balanced attack with no true standouts, as eight different players tallied 30 points or more. The Fighting Saints bested Sioux Falls 3–1 in a best-of-five series. The playoff run would be the last of Hartzell's career as the team finished the 2011–12 season 17–36–7, the second worst record in team history.\n\nOn May 1, 2012, the Sioux Falls Stampede ownership group of Sioux Falls Sports, LLC. sold a majority stake in the team to SD Sports and Entertainment. The new ownership group subsequently fired Hartzell six days later. He is the winningest coach in team history with a 224–152–44 record over seven seasons.\n\nOn May 11, 2012, five days after firing coach Hartzell, the new ownership group hired former University of North Dakota assistant coach Cary Eades. Eades previously spent 15 years over two stints with the program, earning four NCAA Frozen Four appearances and a national championship in 1987. He also spent two seasons as the head coach of the now defunct Dubuque Fighting Saints (1980–2001), going 86–46–7 and winning a National Tournament Championship in 1992. In his first season as head coach in 2012–13, Eades led the club to its best regular season performance finishing 45–17–2, six points shy of a second Anderson Cup title.\n\nLess than a week after winning a Clark Cup championship, head coach Eades departed the club citing contract extension issues to take the vacant head coach position with the Fargo Force.\n\nOn May 21, 2015, the Stampede hired former Colorado College head coach Scott Owens. Owens previously spent 15 seasons with the program for a combined 324-228-62 regular-season record. Prior to his time with the Tigers, he spent four seasons with the Des Moines Buccaneers between 1995 and 1999 and the Madison Capitols between 1986 and 1990, earning a USHL playoff appearance in each season, two Anderson Cup championships, and a Clark Cup championship in 1999.\n\nOn May 17, 2019, the Stampede defeated the Chicago Steel in a three-game sweep for its third Clark Cup championship in team history. The team finished the 2019 Clark Cup playoffs with an 11–1 record.\n\nHead coach Scott Owens announced his retirement from coaching on March 26, 2020, after spending five seasons with the club. The ownership group filled the roles left by Owens with former Minot Minotauros general manager and head coach Marty Murray on April 28, 2020. Murray led the North American Hockey League (NAHL) club to a combined 254–194–44 record over eight seasons, including a division championship in 2016–17 and a 2018 Robertson Cup runner-up finish. He was named NAHL General Manager of the Year after the 2018–19 campaign.\n\nThe official primary colors of the Sioux Falls Stampede are navy and gold with the secondary colors black and white. The primary logo is a navy circle with a gold trim with a white and black buffalo silhouette at the forefront. Above the oval is the word mark \"SIOUX FALLS\" and below \"STAMPEDE.\" The secondary logo is a blue buffalo charging through a cloud of smoke with the left hoof in the forefront. Above the buffalo is the word mark \"SIOUX FALLS\" and below \"STAMPEDE.\" From team inception to sometime prior to the 2005–06 season, the current secondary logo served as the primary logo and vice-versa. Both logos were created by Paulsen Marketing in Sioux Falls. \n\nOn September 10, 1999, the Stampede placed an ad in the Argus Leader asking fans to assist in naming the new team's mascot. On September 21, the team unveiled the official mascot as a blue American bison called Stomp at a community gathering. Jolee Thurn is credited with naming the buffalo. Stomp wears a team jersey, black hockey helmet, navy hockey pants, ice skates while skating and black shoes. The mascot received an updated physical look prior to the 2014–15 season.\n\nRadio coverage is provided by flagship station KELO (AM 1320). The Stampede radio broadcast team is led by Jim Olander and in-studio host Dan Lund. The radio network broadcasts pregame coverage, games with commentary, guest appearances by coachers and players, and postgame wrap-ups.\n\nUnited States Hockey League\n\nThese are the top franchise leaders in regular season points, goals, assists, points per game, games played, and goaltending wins as of the end of the 2019–20 season.\n\nHobey Baker Award\n\nMike Richter Award\n\nUSHL Rookie of the Year\n\nUSHL Defenseman of the Year\n\nCurt Hammer Award (Best reflects USHL goals, team and organization)\n\nDave Tyler Junior Player of the Year Award (USA Hockey Top Junior Player)\n\nAll-USHL First Team\n\nAll-USHL Second Team\n\nAll-USHL Third Team\n\nUSHL All-Rookie First Team\n\nUSHL All-Rookie Second Team\n\nUSHL Coach of the Year\n\nUSHL General Manager of the Year\n\nUSHL Organization of the Year\n\nUSHL 25th Anniversary Team\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1958614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958614", "title": "Cassius (band)", "text": "Cassius (band)\n\nCassius was a French musical duo consisting of producers Philippe Cerboneschi and Hubert Blanc-Francard, better known as Zdar and Boombass (or sometimes Philippe Zdar and Hubert Boombass). Under its different incarnations the duo is likened to the \"French Touch\" movement of electronic music in the second half of the 1990s.\n\nHubert Blanc-Francard (aka Boombass) is a French musician and producer. He is the son of producer Dominique Blanc-Francard. His younger brother Mathieu became famous under the pseudonym Sinclair.\n\nPhilippe Cerboneschi (aka Zdar), born January 28, 1967 in Aix-les-Bains and died June 19, 2019 in Paris, was a French musician, producer and sound engineer. Zdar was Dominique Blanc-Francard's assistant at studios + XXX (Plus30) when he met Boombass in 1988. Outside the Cassius group, Zdar was producer and sound engineer. He notably recorded several albums of -M-, Phoenix and Chromeo. He also recorded for Franz Ferdinand, Beastie Boys, Lou Doillon and Sébastien Tellier among others.\n\nZdar and Boombass started working together in 1988, producing albums for the French hip-hop artist MC Solaar. In 1991, they created their first project, called La Funk Mob, and the following year, they started to increasingly experiment with electronic sounds. Zdar's experience with electronic music was influential in his involvement with Étienne de Crécy in the project Motorbass, who released a sole full-length album, \"Pansoul\".\n\nIn 1996, Zdar and Boombass then created \"Foxxy\", their first self-released house music track, under the name Cassius, and the moderate success that followed lead to them remixing tracks for acts such as Air. In January 1999, they released their first single to become a mainstream hit, \"Cassius 1999\". It was published by Virgin Records, and entered the UK Singles Chart at #7. This was soon followed by their debut album, \"1999\", which had two more singles released from it, \"Feeling For You\" and \"La Mouche\". The music videos for \"Cassius 1999\" and \"Feeling for You\" portrayed the character Deadman, from DC Comics, as a DJ superhero.\n\n2002 saw their second album release, \"Au Rêve\". This featured the \"empowered female disco\" track \"I'm a Woman\", with Jocelyn Brown on vocals, as well as the hit single \"The Sound of Violence\", featuring Steve Edwards on vocals. This album also had collaborations with Wu-Tang Clan member Ghostface Killah and Leroy Burgess.\n\nCassius returned to the studio in 2006, for the more experimental single \"Toop Toop\", but the next album, titled \"15 Again\", featured more vocal collaborations than the duo had done with \"Au Rêve\".\n\nWhile rehearsing their \"15 Again\" album tour, Cassius provided the community with the a cappella track of their single \"Toop Toop\" and encouraged fans and friends to start remixing the song. It became an immediate success: the band started the Cassius Workshop project and released more a cappellas for remixing purposes. They claim to have received more than 400 remixes.\n\nCassius's song \"I Love You So\" was sampled on the track \"Why I Love You\" on Jay-Z and Kanye West's 2011 collaboration album \"Watch the Throne.\n\nIn 2016, Cassius released their fourth album, \"Ibifornia\", with Pharrell Williams, Ryan Tedder, Cat Power, Mike D and Matthieu Chédid (as guitarist of the album) as guests.\n\nOn 19 June 2019, two days before the release of Cassius's fifth album \"Dreems\", Zdar died after falling from a 19-story building in Paris. He was 52 years old. On the release day of \"Dreems\", the band announced that the album was the final album from Cassius.\n\nFollowing the passing of Philippe Zdar, Ed Banger and Glitterbox Recordings have come together to release the final collaborative Cassius production, with the blessing of Boombass and Zdar’s family. It's a remix of the song 'I'm Not Defeated' by Fiorous. The song was released on February 21, 2020 on limited vinyl edition.\n\nAfter Zdar's death, Boombass continued his solo career. Being alone now, he says on May 2020, that Cassius has no reason to live. On 20 September 2019, Boombass released a remix of \"Grand petit con\" performed by -M-. He unveils on May 14, 2020, \"Pour que tu\" which is present on EP \"Le virage\", composed of 5 songs and released on June 5 2020.\n\n\n\n\nCassius\nLa Funk Mob\n\n\n\n"}

This effect was discovered in 1995 by the Research Institute of Toto Ltd. for titanium dioxide irradiated by sunlight. Under light irradiation, water dropped onto titanium dioxide forms no contact angle (almost 0 degrees).\n\nSuperhydrophilic material has various advantages. For example, it can defog glass, and it can also enable oil spots to be swept away easily with water. Such materials are already commercialized as door mirrors for cars, coatings for buildings, self-cleaning glass, etc.\n\nSeveral mechanisms of this superhydrophilicity have been proposed by researchers. One is the change of the surface structure to a metastable structure, and another is cleaning the surface by the photodecomposition of dirt such as organic compounds adsorbed on the surface, after either of which water molecules can adsorb to the surface. The mechanism is still controversial, and it is too soon to decide which suggestion is correct. To decide, atomic scale measurements and other studies will be necessary.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1958623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958623", "title": "Tri-City Storm", "text": "Tri-City Storm\n\nThe Tri-City Storm is a Tier I junior ice hockey team playing in the Western Confence of the United States Hockey League (USHL).\n\nOn May 15, 1999, the USHL unanimously voted to allow then Omaha Lancers' owner, Ted Baer, to place a new team in Kearney, Nebraska, for the 2000–01 season. In June 1999, Jim Hillman was named the team's first head coach. The Tri-City Storm won their first game on September 30, 2000. The Storm finally played their first home game on November 18, 2000, after eight months of construction on the Tri-City Arena. The Storm were named USHL Organization of the Year in their first year of operation.\n\nThe Storm narrowly missed the playoffs in their second season. In the following 2002–03 season, during the midst of a 10-game losing streak in mid-December, Jim Hillman resigned as coach and general manager. He was replaced by former Topeka Scrarecrows head coach, Bliss Littler, in January. The Storm rallied to make the playoffs with a seven-game win streak down the stretch.\n\nThe team had their best season in 2003–04 and won the Anderson Cup for the best regular season record, finishing with a record of 43–12–5 and 91 points. The team featured future National Hockey League players Bill Thomas, Mark Van Guilder, and Peter Mannino. The Storm made their first Clark Cup final, but were eliminated in four games by the Waterloo Black Hawks. The USHL named Tri-City Organization of the Year for the second time.\n\nTri-City made the division finals again in the following season despite a fourth place finish in the division. They qualified for the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season, narrowly beating out Sioux City for the final spot in the division. The Storm lost in the opening round playoff series three-games-to-two against the Sioux Falls Stampede.\n\nOn May 3, 2006, owner Ted Baer sold the Storm to Joel Wiens after seven years. The Storm finished the 2006–07 regular season with 78 points, good for second place in the West Division. They then won a seven-game series against Sioux City, but were knocked out of the playoffs by the eventual Clark Cup champions, the Sioux Falls Stampede. \n\nThe Storm failed to qualify for the playoffs for the first time in six seasons in 2007–08. After the season, head coach and general manager Bliss Littler resigned to accept the head coaching position with the Omaha Lancers. Assistant coach Tom Rudrud was promoted to head coach. The Storm then had their worst season to date, winning just 11 out of 60 games that included a franchise-worst 19-game losing streak. \n\nIn April 2009, Wiens sold the arena and team to Las Vegas businessman Kirk Brooks. Brooks announced that Drew Schoneck had replaced Tom Rudrud as head coach. In the 2009–10 season, forward Jaden Schwartz led the league with 50 assists and 83 points. The Storm finished fourth place in the West Division with a 29–25–6 record. The Storm were swept in the first round of the playoffs by former coach Bliss Littler and the Omaha Lancers in three games. The St. Louis Blues selected Schwartz in the first round, 14th overall, the highest Storm selection at that time.\n\nIn 2010–11, the Storm finished last in the Western Conference. After another slow start in 2011–12, head coach Drew Schoneck was relieved of his duties and assistant coach Josh Hauge was promoted. Under Hauge, the Storm rallied late in the season and were able to clinch a playoff spot, finishing in sixth in the Western Conference. The Waterloo Black Hawks defeated Tri-City in the first round of the postseason. In Hauge's first full season behind the bench, injuries plagued the Storm and the team again finished last in their conference. Captain Brian Ward had a strong season offensively, scoring 54 points in just 42 games. Michael Vecchione led the team with 26 goals. \n\nAfter 15 games into the 2013–14 season, Hauge was fired and replaced by Jim Hulton. The team missed the playoffs for the second straight season. The following season, and first full season under Hulton, would lead the Storm to a second place finish within their conference. Tri-City's Chris Wilkie scored 35 goals, tying Rastislav Spirko (2003–04) for the Storm's single-season record. The Storm swept the Omaha Lancers, 3-games-to-0, in the first round. The team then faced Sioux Falls in the conference finals. Led by USHL Rookie of the Year Kieffer Bellows, the Stampede beat the Storm, 3-games-to-1. The Storm won the first game, but before game two, an ice maintenance worker accidentally drilled a hole in a pipe causing water to burst onto the ice. Game two was postponed from Saturday, April 25 to Wednesday, April 29. After the five-day break, Sioux Falls won three straight games.\n\nHead coach and general manager Jim Hulton was relieved of his duties in the 2015 offseason and replaced by Bill Muckalt. The former five-year NHL veteran came to the Storm following a four-year stint as assistant coach at Michigan Tech. In 2015–16, the team had its best start since 2003–04, winning its first four games. The Storm went on a team-record 13-game point streak from February 6 to March 19 and the best record in the Western Conference for the first time since 2003–04. The Storm finished with 73 points and a 28–15–10–7 record. Twenty of the Storm's 60 games went to overtime, and the Storm lost 17 of them (10 in overtime), the Tier I USHL record for most losses past regulation. The Storm took a club-low 726 penalty minutes, fewest in the USHL that season. Goaltender Jake Kielly set the Storm's single-season record for best save percentage (.919) and went on a 19-game point streak during the middle of the season. Mattias Goransson finished the regular season with 34 assists, the Storm defensemen record.\n\nDuring the 2016 Clark Cup playoffs, the Storm swept the Sioux Falls Stampede, 3–0, in the Western Conference semifinals, outscoring the Stampede, 12–3. In the Western Conference finals, the Storm beat Waterloo in a full five-game series, earning their second Clark Cup finals appearance. In the finals, the Storm faced the Dubuque Fighting Saints in a best-of-five series, sweeping the Fighting Saints in three games and won the Clark Cup for the first time. The Storm outscored the Fighting Saints 13–4 with the line of Dan Labosky, Alex Limoges, and Wade Allison on ice for 11 of 13 Storm goals. Wade Allison was named Clark Cup most valuable player and the Philadelphia Flyers selected him in the second round of the 2016 NHL Entry Draft. Goaltender Jake Kielly set the Tier I USHL postseason record with a .950 save percentage and also had a 1.64 goals against average. Bill Muckalt became the fifth head coach in the Tier I history of the USHL to deliver a championship in his first season.\n\nIn the following 2016–17 season, the Storm finished last in the conference with a 21–31–6–2 record. The Storm started the season with points in three straight games (2–0–0–1) and were 7–5–1–2 a quarter of the way through the season. From December 1 through the end of the season, Tri-City went 14–26–5–0. The Storm made a number of mid-season trades aimed at building for the future. On February 6, the Storm moved assistant captain Joey Matthews, second-leading scorer Charlie Kelleher, and Odeen Tufto to Sioux City for draft picks and a player to be named later. The same day, Tri-City executed two separate trades with Waterloo, moving captain Alex Limoges (for forward Caleb Rule, a draft pick and a player to be named later) and starting goaltender Dayton Rasmussen (for D Tyler Borsch). After the trades, the Storm went 6–12–1–0. Tri-City sent a league-high five players to the 2017 USHL/NHL Top Prospects Game and forward Paul Washe was named Team West MVP (two goals) in Sioux Falls. Washe became the second straight Storm player to win Team West MVP after Wade Allison in 2016. Three Storm players (Alex Limoges, Paul Washe, Dayton Rasmussen) won the Gold Medal with the US Junior Select Team at the 2016 World Junior A Challenge in Bonnyville, Alberta.\n\nPrior to the 2017–18 season, Muckalt left the Storm to become the associate head coach at his alma mater, the University of Michigan. Former Youngstown Phantoms and Orlando Solar Bears head coach, Anthony Noreen, was named as his replacement. Noreen led the team to an Anderson Cup regular season championship in 2018–19 and won USHL Coach of the Year. The 2019–20 season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the Storm still extended Noreen's contract through 2023–24.\n\nNotable former players who have continued to play professionally include Mason Appleton, Blake Coleman, Christian Hanson, Jack Hillen, Nick Lappin, Jarod Palmer, Scott Parse, Jaden Schwartz, Bill Thomas, and Mike Vecchione.\n\nThomas and Konrad Reeder are tied for the most goals in team history, each scoring 60 during their careers in Kearney. Mario Lamoureux, who played four seasons for the Storm, has the all-time assists record with 85.\n\nSchwartz, who played for the Storm during the 2009–10 season, owns most of the team's single season records including assists (50), points (83), power play goals (16), power play assists (22), power play points (38), shorthanded points (8), multi-point games (24), consecutive multi-point games (6) and total shots on goal (242).\n\n"}

He was also producer on the futuristic, prophetic trans-Atlantic & Australasian hit, \"In the Year 2525\" by one-hit-wonders Zager & Evans. Later in 1968, he moved to Nashville, where he did session work and produced Bob Wills' \"24 Great Hits by Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys\". In the mid-1970s Allsup served as the producer for a pair of Asleep at the Wheel albums.\n\nIn 1979, he started a club named Tommy's Heads Up Saloon in Fort Worth. The club was named for Allsup's coin toss with Valens 20 years beforehand.\n\nThe last surviving member of Buddy Holly's \"touring\" Crickets for the 1959 Winter Dance Party, Tommy Allsup died on January 11, 2017, at 85 years old in a hospital in Springfield, Missouri after complications from hernia surgery.\n\n\n\n"}

On 13 August 1860, during the attack on the Taku Forts -- 大沽炮台, in Chinese, or \"dàgū pàotái\" -- Chinese troops captured two British soldiers and a group of coolies. (Some contemporary accounts record the latter as Sikh soldiers from India, and indeed the poem refers to \"dusky Indians\")\n\nThe details of the subsequent events are not well-recorded, but according to reports in \"The Times\", one Private John Moyse, of the 3rd (East Kent) Regiment (commonly known as \"the Buffs\") refused to kowtow to his captors. Apparently he had \"declared he would not prostrate himself before any Chinaman alive,\" and as a result, he was summarily executed. The poem refers to Moyse as a young Kentish farmboy; it is quite possible that he was, in fact, a middle-aged Irishman. However, the poem was written on the strength of newspaper reports, and it is likely that Doyle was unaware of the discrepancies.\n\nDespite the report in \"The Times\", there is speculation concerning whether the incident took place as was popularly supposed. Garnet Wolseley, who was present at the taking of the Taku forts, insisted that \"The man belonging to the Buffs was either killed, or 'died of drink,' as the Chinese say.\" The source of the information -- a soldier in the 44th Regiment -- was, according to Wolseley, not reliable. \"His mind, indeed, seemed to be unbalanced, as in addition to the untruths he told, he talked utter nonsense about what he pretended he had overheard his captors say.\"\n\nD.F. Rennie, a doctor with the British troops, also denied that the incident took place. \"The Manchester Times\" reprinted Rennie's account on December 2, 1865, with the conclusion\nThus, it would seem that this unfortunate man, who, through the romancing propensities of his comrade of the 44th, and the ready ear for 'sensationalism of the \"Times\" correspondent, was believed by the deluded British public to have been decapitated because he would not kow-tow to Sang-ko-lin-sin, died without ever seeing that personage at all.\"\n"}

It stars Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Tom Courtenay, Donald Pleasence, Joanna Pettet and Philippe Noiret. The screenplay by Joseph Kessel and Paul Dehn was loosely based on the beginning of the novel of the same name by German author Hans Hellmut Kirst. The writing credits also include the line \"based on an incident written by James Hadley Chase\". Gore Vidal is said to have contributed to the screenplay, but was not credited.\nThe musical score was composed by Maurice Jarre.\n\nThe film was a French-British-American co-production. Parts of this Western-made film were shot on location in Warsaw, which at the time was behind the Iron Curtain. The last scenes of the film were shot in Munich.\n\nThe murder of a prostitute, which was also a German agent, in German-occupied Warsaw in 1942 causes Major Grau of the Abwehr to start an investigation. His evidence soon points to the killer being one of three German generals: General von Seidlitz-Gabler; General Kahlenberge, his chief of staff; or General Tanz. Grau's investigation is cut short by his sudden promotion and transfer to Paris at the instigation of these officers.\n\nThe case in Warsaw remains closed until all three officers meet in Paris in July 1944. Paris is then a hotbed of intrigue, with senior Wehrmacht officers plotting to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Kahlenberge is deeply involved in the plot, while von Seidlitz-Gabler is aware of its existence but is sitting on the fence, awaiting the outcome. Tanz is unaware of the plot and remains totally loyal to Hitler.\n\nOn the night of 19 July 1944, Tanz orders his driver, Kurt Hartmann, to procure a prostitute; Tanz butchers her so as to implicate Hartmann, but offers Hartmann the chance to desert, which he accepts. When Grau, who is now a Lieutenant Colonel, learns of the murder, committed in the same manner as the first, he resumes his investigation and concludes that Tanz is the killer. However, his timing is unfortunate, because the very next day is the 20 July assassination attempt. While Grau is accusing Tanz face to face, word arrives that Hitler has survived, so Tanz kills Grau and labels him as one of the plot conspirators to cover his tracks.\n\nJumping to 1965, the murder of a prostitute in Hamburg draws the attention of Interpol Inspector Morand, who owes a debt of gratitude to Grau for not revealing his connection to the French Resistance during the war. Almost certain there is a connection to Grau's 1942 case, Morand reopens the cold case, soon finding a link to the 1944 murder as well. \nMorand begins to tie up the loose ends: he finds no criminal activity from Kahlenberge or Seidlitz-Gabler, but learns of one man who knew which man is the real killer. Morand confronts Tanz, recently released after serving 20 years as a war criminal, at a reunion dinner for Tanz's former panzer division. When Morand produces Hartmann as his witness, Tanz goes into a vacant room and shoots himself.\n\nBoth O'Toole and Sharif were hesitant to take on their roles for this film. Feeling they owed it to producer Sam Spiegel for making them international stars in \"Lawrence of Arabia\", they did so anyway.\n\n"}

He was the brother of François Arago (1786–1853), a scientist and politician, the most famous of the six Arago brothers. His parents were François Bonaventure Arago (1754–1814) and Marie Arago (1755–1845). His four other brothers were Jean Arago (1788–1836), a general in the Mexican army; Victor Arago (1792-1867), a military in France; Joseph Arago (1796-1860), also a military in France and Mexico, Étienne Arago (1802–1892), a writer and politician.\n\nJacques Arago joined Louis de Freycinet as an artist when he left Toulon in 1817 in command of a scientific voyage around the world aboard the corvette \"Uranie\". The expedition returned in 1820 and Arago was the first to publish an account, the \"Promenade autour du monde\", in the form of letters to a friend named Battle, in 1822. An English translation followed in 1823. He continued to expand on his adventures in further editions and in the late 1830s published a much longer version under the title \"Souvenirs d'un Aveugle\" (Memoirs of a Blind Man). There are significant differences from the \"Promenade\" and the reliability is in doubt. Having been given a challenge many years later by a lady at a social dinner, he then published \"Voyage autour du monde, sans la lettre A\" (\"Voyage around the world, without the letter A\"), later known as \"Curieux voyage autour du monde\", in 1853, where he tells of his round trip lipogrammatically, that is, without once using the letter \"A\".

{"id": "1958671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958671", "title": "Fijian name", "text": "Fijian name\n\nNaming conventions in Fiji differ greatly, both between and within ethnic groups in Fiji. Indigenous Fijians have a set of cultural practices which today are more loosely followed, and to some extent blended with elements of European culture with regard to names. In the Indian community, traditional Indian naming practices co-exist with influence from the Fijian and European cultures.\n\nThe use of surnames is not traditional in Fijian culture. In recent years, it has become more common, but remains far from universal. Whether to have a surname, and if so, whether to use it, are very much a matter of personal preference. One’s last name is not always, therefore, a surname.\n\nThe majority of Fijians have two given names, a Christian name taken usually from the Bible, and a traditional name. A child may be baptized or registered with a surname, usually derived from the father’s traditional given name. It is not unusual for persons baptized with surnames to discard them; some reclaim them later in life, and some who did not originally have one may later adopt their father’s traditional name as a surname. It is not unheard of for Fijians to be known by different names at different stages of their lives.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka was known as \"Sitiveni Ligamamada\" in his earlier days as a rugby player. Another notable example is George Speight, the instigator of a coup d'état in 2000, who contested the subsequent election under the name of \"Ilikimi Naitini.\" He did not need to change his name by deed poll; he only had to register his candidacy with his surname and English given name omitted. Maciu Navakasuasua, a convicted accomplice of Speight’s, revealed on October 28, 2005 that he had emigrated to Australia and avoided a blacklist against his name by using his grandfather’s surname, which was registered on both his birth certificate and his passport.\n\nGiven the non-universal use of surnames, it is not uncommon for several members of a family all to bear different last names. Well known examples include Ratu Epeli Nailatikau (the President of Fiji since 2009) and his brother, Tu'uakitau Cokanauto.\n\nMany Fijians who do not have surnames register their children with their own traditional given name as a surname. Well known examples include the late Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, Fiji's longtime Prime Minister and President, whose children are surnamed \"Mara,\" though it was his given name, not his surname as most foreigners wrongly suppose. President Nailatikau has likewise passed his given name on to his children as a surname.\n\nRatu Josefa Iloilovatu Uluivuda, better known simply as \"Ratu Josefa Iloilo\", who served as President of Fiji from 2000 to 2009, is an example of a Fijian who had a surname, but did not generally use it, except for legal purposes. \"Iloilo,\" the name by which he was generally known, which most non-Fijians mistakenly assumed to be his surname, was thus a diminutive of his second given name. This shortening of names is another common Fijian custom; another notable example of this phenomenon is rugby star Rupeni Caucaunibuca, widely referred to both inside and outside Fiji as \"Caucau\".\n\nFijians of chiefly rank use titles with their names. In most parts of Fiji, the title used by male chiefs is \"Ratu;\" the female equivalent is \"Adi.\" In Rewa Province, the local dialect substitutes Ro for both titles. In the Lau Islands, male and female chiefs are both styled Roko, while in Kadavu Island and western areas female chiefs are titled Bulou. The title is used immediately before the name, or before another title (e.g., Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, Ratu Dr. Epeli Nailatikau). However, it follows military titles (e.g., Brigadier general Ratu Epeli Ganilau).\n\nToday, names may be inherited or passed on between relatives, but traditionally, Fijian names have a meaning and a history surrounding them. Before the arrival of Christianity and European culture, Fijian names were often based on circumstances or events surrounding the birth of the child, as well as other aspects. A modern example of a name that reflects both traditional and modern naming conventions is Joni Madraiwiwi, who served as Vice-President from 2004 to 2006. \"Joni\" is the Fijian rendering of \"John\". \"Madraiwiwi\", which means \"sour bread,\" was passed on from his grandfather, also \"Ratu\" Joni Madraiwiwi. The elder Madraiwiwi was named by his father, Mara Kapaiwai (a namesake, not an ancestor, of the modern \"Ratu\" Mara), who was facing execution and eating his last meal. Even the taste of bread had turned sour to him, hence the naming of his son.\n\nNot all children were named for such dramatic events. Tanoa Senibua was named for the \"fragrance of the Bua\" flower which was in the air surrounding the child's birthplace, and \"Tanoa\" as the father of the child was drinking kava from a Tanoa when he received the news his son was born. A set protocol would be followed for the naming, but protocol is less strictly adhered to in this modern era.\n\nThe names of Fiji Islanders of Indian ancestry provide clues to an individual's religion and caste, and to what part of India their ancestors came from. Muslims very often have names taken from the Quran, while Sikhs are almost invariably surnamed Singh (if male) or Kaur (if female). Contrary to a common misconception, however, not everybody bearing that name is a Sikh: the great majority are Hindu (such as arguably the most notable Indo-Fijian, golfer Vijay Singh). Surnames, although not universal in India, have been adopted by almost all Indo-Fijians (despite their less-than-universal use by indigenous Fijians).\n\nAlthough the caste system is all but dead among Fiji Indians, \"Brahmins\" (priests) can be recognized by the surname, \"Sharma\", while the \"Kshatriyas\" (warriors) can be recognized by the surname Singh.\n\n\n"}

CHLO had a Top 40 music format during the 1960s into the 70s, and was a Music of Your Life station in the mid-1980s. After a number of years as a country station, CHLO moved to the FM band in 1994, changing its calls to CFHK-FM. CFHK, known on-air as \"The Hawk\", had a modern rock format, which later evolved into classic rock. The station continued to operate out of St. Thomas until the late 1990s.\n\nOn January 12, 2000, CFHK joined the \"Energy Radio\" network, while The Hawk moved to co-owned CKDK in Woodstock. The Energy Radio network was unstable and station branding changed frequently. In 2002, the network was pulled. CFHK became local again as \"Energy 103\", serving only London and surrounding area. \n\nIn August 2004, Energy Radio changed formats to its current adult top 40 format to go up against adult contemporary station CIQM-FM and adult hits station CHST-FM. The flip to hot AC was caused by previous hot AC station CHST-FM flipping to its current Bob FM format in July 2003. In August 2005, the Energy Radio brand was folded completely, and CFHK rebranded as \"103-1 Fresh FM\", due to the fact it could match the current CFHK calls. The morning program featuring \"D, Mindy & Gord\" moved from co-owned CFPL-FM (FM96) to launch the new station format. At the same time CFHK-FM was brought out by Canwest.\n\nIn February 2011, Mindy Williamson was let go from Fresh Mornings, as the radio station apparently indicated they were moving in another 'direction'. D (Darrin Laidman) and Gord remained as morning show hosts for a while longer. Fresh Mornings hosts are now Mark LeBel and Kim Woodbridge. Williamson is at CKLO-FM with the Stax morning show and D. is now morning host at 95.3 Fresh FM in Hamilton.\n\nBy September 2010, CIQM-FM flipped to hot adult contemporary from its longtime adult contemporary format, competing with CFHK. By August 2012, CIQM-FM flipped to top 40, leaving CFHK as the only hot AC station again in London. This was to fill the void left by the pre-2004 CFHK.\n\nOn December 11, 2013, Corus Radio received CRTC approval to change the authorized contours of CFHK-FM, as well as its class from B to C1, plus increasing the average effective radiated power (ERP) from 16,700 watts to 22,000 watts (maximum ERP from 50,000 watts to 60,000 watts), increasing the effective height of the antenna above average terrain (HAAT) from 150 metres to 179.6 metres, and relocating the transmission site from its current location, on Elgin County Road 30 at Truman Line north of St. Thomas, to its new location on CFPL-DT's tower in London Ontario The station will broadcast directionally towards the north and south, to protect other stations on or first-adjacent to CFHK-FM, including WQUS Lapeer, Michigan (also on 103.1), CKCI-FM 103.3 Sarnia, and CKLH-FM 102.9 in Hamilton. On April 1, 2016, as part of a corporate re-organization, Shaw Media was merged into Shaw's sister company, Corus Entertainment.\n\n"}

The current constitution delineates the basic function of that state's government. Among other things, it determines Syria's character to be Arab, democratic, and republican. Further, in line with pan-Arab ideology, it describes the country as a region of the wider Arab world and its people as an integral part of the Arab nation.\n\nThe Syrian Constitution of 1930, drafted by a committee under Ibrahim Hananu, was the founding constitution of the Syrian Republic under the French Mandate. The constitution required the President to be of Muslim faith (article 3). It was replaced by the Constitution of 5 September 1950, which was restored following the Constitution of 10 July 1953 and the Constitution of the United Arab Republic. It was eventually replaced by the Provisional Constitution of 25 April 1964 which itself was replaced by the Provisional Constitution of 1 May 1969.\n\nA new constitution was adopted on 13 March 1973 and was in use until 27 February 2012. It entrenched the power of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, its §8 describing the party as \"the leading party in the society and the state\", even if Syria was not, as is often believed, a one-party system in formal terms. The constitution had an amendment in 2000 which set the minimum age of the President from 40 to 34.\n\nDuring the 2011–2012 Syrian uprising, a new constitution was put to a referendum. Amongst other changes:\n\nThe referendum resulted in the adoption of the new constitution, which came into force on 27 February 2012. The constitution guarantees equal rights and opportunities under the law, supplemented by labor laws which guarantee equal pay and maternity benefits for women. Effective power in Syria rests with the President of the Republic (since 2000, Bashar al-Assad, re–elected in 2014), who, according to §84 of the old constitution, was elected in an uncontested popular referendum on the proposal of the Syrian branch of the Ba'ath Party. However, in accordance with the new constitution, other parties withheld an opportunity to assume presidential roles in the country, evident as of the 2014 Syrian election.\n\nThis current constitution was a result of a constitutional referendum held in Syria on 26 February 2012. In response to the Syrian uprising, President Bashar al-Assad ordered a new constitution to be drafted. This constitutional referendum was not monitored by foreign observers.\n\nThe Constitution is divided into 6 parts (excluding the Introduction) which are called Chapters.\n\n"}

{"id": "1958711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958711", "title": "CKDK-FM", "text": "CKDK-FM\n\nCKDK-FM is a radio station owned by Corus Entertainment and licensed to the city of Woodstock, Ontario, Canada, serving the London, Ontario market and transmitting at 51,000 watts at 103.9 MHz on the FM dial, covering most of southwestern Ontario. The station airs a country music format branded as Country 104. The studio is located on Dundas Street in Woodstock but it has an office in downtown London and its transmitter is located near Karn Road in Woodstock. Until August 2008, the station primarily played classic rock; it afterward evolved to a 1960s–1980s oldies/classic hits playlist, but eventually settled into an adult hits format under the branding More 103.9. The format change to country music took place on February 28, 2014. Thé station currently plays mostly new country, but also plays classic country songs from earlier decades, especially the 80s and 90s.\n\nThis station can be heard clearly from London and Strathroy in the west, to Georgetown in the east and to the Waterloo Region to the northeast, covering much of Southwestern Ontario, broadcasting to a potential audience of around 1.5 million people. Under the right conditions, CKDK programming can also be heard in parts of Metro Detroit.\n\nPopular shows under the former classic rock format included \"McArthur in the Morning\", \"Little Steven's Underground Garage\" and \"The Legends of Classic Rock\". The station's slogan was \"Playing the Greatest Rock and Roll of All Time, 103.9 The Hawk\". \"The Legends of Classic Rock\" was syndicated from Q107 in Toronto, and is heard on all Corus-owned classic rock stations.\n\nCKDK began broadcasting on AM 1340 in 1947 as CKOX. In 1947, C.O. Tatham and Charles Perry applied for an FM licence at Woostock as CKOX-FM. They later withdrew their application. The station reapplied a year later to operate at 106.9 MHz, but it is unknown if the station was ever built. The call letters changed to CKDK in 1977, and moved to FM 102.3 in 1986. It moved to the current 103.9 FM frequency in 1993, known at the time as \"K104\" with an adult contemporary format. The station joined the Energy Radio network in 1998, simulcast from CING-FM in Burlington. On January 12, 2000, CKDK and sister station CFHK 103.1 in St. Thomas, swapped formats, but not call letters. The Hawk format on CFHK was originally an \"alternative format\", like FM96, but this was changed to a classic rock format on December 21, 1997.\n\nCKDK became highly focused on London once it joined the Energy Radio network, leaving Woodstock without a local radio station. In 2004, competing Standard Radio filed a complaint with the CRTC accusing owner Corus Entertainment of \"neglecting\" Woodstock by operating CKDK out of London. Corus subsequently moved some of its operations for CKDK to Woodstock, and Byrnes Communications received approval to start up a new station in Woodstock, CIHR-FM.\n\nOn July 16, 2008, The Hawk introduced a new on-air imaging package, changing their slogan to \"The Greatest Rock N' Roll of All Time\".\n\nIn early August 2008 the station officially changed their playlist from classic rock to classic hits, however it had slowly been changing for over a year. The station has added rebroadcasts of Casey Kasem's \"American Top 40\" shows from the 1970s as part of its new image.\n\nOn July 22, 2011, the station dropped its classic hits format for an adult hits format under the More 103.9 branding, similar in format to Corus' Edmonton station CKNG-FM (92-5 Joe FM).\n\nOn February 28, 2014, at 5 PM, the adult hits format was dropped for a country music format, branded as \"Country 104\".\n\nRock the Park (formerly The Hawk Rocks the Park) was an annual concert put on by 103.9 FM in Harris Park in London. All proceeds from the concert went to the Bethany's Hope Foundation.\n\nOn September 25, 2012, Corus received CRTC approval to change the authorized contours of the english-language commercial radio programming undertaking CKDK-FM Woodstock by relocating its transmitter site, by decreasing the average effective radiated power from 52,000 to 51,000 watts and by increasing its effective height of antenna above average terrain from 133 to 138.4 metres.\n\n"}
{"id": "1958713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958713", "title": "WHIO-TV", "text": "WHIO-TV\n\nWHIO-TV, virtual channel 7 (UHF digital channel 33), is a CBS-affiliated television station licensed to Dayton, Ohio, United States. The station is owned by Atlanta-based Cox Media Group. WHIO-TV's transmitter is located off Germantown Street in the Highview Hills neighborhood of southwest Dayton. It shares facilities with sister properties the \"Dayton Daily News\" and Cox's Miami Valley radio stations in the Cox Media Center building on South Main Street near downtown Dayton. On cable, WHIO-TV can be seen on Charter Spectrum channel 7.\n\nWHIO-TV signed on February 23, 1949, on channel 13. It was the first television station in Dayton to begin broadcasting, although WLWD (then channel 5, now WDTN, channel 2) was the first to have its license granted.\n\nThe station has been owned by the Cox publishing family and their related companies since its inception; Cox also publishes the \"Dayton Daily News\", the first newspaper ever purchased by Cox Enterprises founder James M. Cox. In fact, WHIO-TV is only the second of three television stations built by Cox from the ground up, merely five months after its sister property WSB-TV in Atlanta, where Cox Media Group is headquartered now. WHIO-TV's licensee, Miami Valley Broadcasting, was originally used as the official name for Cox Media's television arm for decades.\n\nWHIO-TV has been a CBS affiliate from the very beginning, and is the only station in Dayton never to have changed its primary affiliation; it did air some programming from the long-defunct DuMont Television Network during its first three years on the air.\n\nThe station moved to channel 7 in 1952 following the release of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s \"Sixth Report and Order\", which reorganized VHF channel assignments throughout much of Ohio and the Midwest.\n\nWHIO-TV also served as the default CBS affiliate for most of the Lima, Ohio DMA. (The station reaches most of the Lima DMA with a Grade B signal). This was especially the case before a low-powered CBS affiliate, WLMO-LP, went on the air in Lima. WHIO-TV also remains on Spectrum's Lima cable systems, along with Columbus CBS affiliate WBNS-TV.\n\nOn December 15, 2009, Cox Media Group announced that it would move WHIO-TV and its Dayton radio cluster–WHIO AM-FM, WHKO and WZLR–from its home since the 1950s on Wilmington Avenue in Dayton (at the Kettering city line), to the Cox Media Center building (also the current home of the \"Daily News\") on South Main Street in Dayton, by December 2010. WHIO-TV began broadcasting from the new facility at 2:35 a.m. on December 12, 2010.\n\nWHIO-TV's newscasts, known as \"NewsCenter 7\" since the mid-1970s, have been in first place in the Nielsen ratings for many years, and that trend continues to this day.\n\nWHIO-TV's digital subchannel 7.2 became an affiliate of MeTV on December 1, 2014. The subchannel is branded as \"MeTV WHIO Classic Television\". A longtime, formerly-used lower-case WHIO logo was included along with the MeTV logo. The subchannel's on-air advertisements include old WHIO radio jingles running over clips of former WHIO-TV anchors and current MeTV shows. The subchannel also runs jingles from the \"Hit Radio\" and \"Warp Factor\" packages created by JAM Creative Productions in Dallas.\n\nDigital subchannel 7.3 was added as a Laff affiliate on April 15, 2015, the network's launch date.\n\nIn February 2019, it was announced that Apollo Global Management would acquire Cox Media Group and Northwest Broadcasting's stations. Although the group had planned to operate under the name Terrier Media, it was announced in June 2019 that Apollo would also acquire Cox's radio and advertising businesses, and retain the Cox Media Group name. The sale was completed on December 17, 2019.\n\nOn November 5, 2019, WHIO-TV's over-the-air (OTA) signal became unavailable to much of the market after, according to the station, defects in its new transmitter resulted in electric arcs, burning the old transmission line. According to the station, the need to inspect, repair and/or replace over of transmission line, coupled with inclement weather and a shortage of tower repair crews due to the then-recent spectrum reallocation repack, delayed the repair process. The outage affected OTA reception of all subchannels and reception of subchannel 7.1 (CBS) for all satellite television viewers who subscribed to local channel packages, as the satellite providers rebroadcast WHIO-TV's OTA signal of subchannel 7.1. A few days into the outage, with the consent of WHIO-TV, DirecTV replaced the station at first with WCBS-TV from New York City, then with WKRC-TV from Cincinnati; Dish Network replaced the station with WOIO from Cleveland. Customers using cable or streaming television services were still able to view WHIO-TV programming. On November 15, per an agreement with Greater Dayton Public Television, owner of PBS member WPTD (channel 16), WHIO-TV requested special temporary authority from the FCC to transmit its main (CBS) subchannel over subchannel 16.2, displacing WPTD's \"16 Again\" service. On November 18, WPTD subchannel 16.2 began broadcasting WHIO-TV programming OTA, and this feed was also picked up by DirecTV and Dish Network. The resolution on 16.2 was in 480i standard definition, compared to channel 7.1's 1080i high definition and the signal also lacked closed captioning; on the first day of broadcast, most of the audio feed was missing, but this was subsequently corrected; subchannels 7.2 (MeTV) and 7.3 (Laff) remained unavailable to OTA viewers. On November 21, 2019, WHIO-TV announced its signal was once again available for OTA viewers; DirecTV and Dish Network restored WHIO-TV's signal from subchannel 7.1 and WPTD returned to normal content on subchannel 16.2. Once WHIO-TV's digital broadcast was restored, many OTA viewers had to rescan their tuners to pick up the station's signal since they would have already rescanned for WDTN's November 8 move.\n\nIn 1953, Cox and Taft Broadcasting formed the short-lived \"Tri-State Network\" to compete with entertainment programming produced by Crosley Broadcasting Corporation and airing on Crosley television stations in the Dayton, Cincinnati and Columbus markets. On January 11, 1954, a new version of \"The Wendy Barrie Show\" (which had aired several years earlier on several national networks) premiered from WHIO-TV's studios; it was simulcast on Taft's WKRC-TV in Cincinnati and WTVN-TV (now WSYX) in Columbus. Wendy Barrie's contract was terminated in October 1954.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWHIO-DT began transmitting its digital signal on channel 41 in October 2001. The station shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 7, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 41. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 7.\n\nWHIO-TV moved its digital signal from channel 41 to channel 33 at 10 a.m. on October 18, 2019, as part of the FCC's spectrum reallocation process.\n\nThroughout the 1960s and into the early 1970s, WHIO-TV's logo was the numeral \"7\" with the station's call letters and city of license inside a perforated circle. By the early 1970s the logo was streamlined, with the \"7\" now broken at the point where the two lines in the \"7\" meet; by this time the \"7\" was by itself inside a solid unbroken circle (usually with the call letters nearby), drawing comparisons with the \"Circle 7 logo\" used by New York's WABC-TV and other ABC-owned stations. A graphics package used around 1996 also was used, with modifications, at three other Cox-owned stations: WSOC-TV in Charlotte, WFTV in Orlando, and KIRO-TV in Seattle. Aside from some slight changes, this logo remained until early 2007, when the break was removed. Even after the change, the \"broken 7\" logo remained on the anchor desk until the move to the Cox Media Center building in December 2010.\n\nThe station debuted its new \"button 7\" logo on March 30, 2013, which sports a simple white \"7\" on a blue circular background.\n\nThe television station's call letters, as well as those of its sister radio stations, were depicted in a particular lower-case font from the 1970s until 1992. That logo was resurrected to become part of the branding for the MeTV digital subchannel.\n\nOutside of the CBS network schedule, syndicated programming on WHIO-TV includes \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\", \"Dr. Phil\", \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\", \"Wheel of Fortune\", and \"Entertainment Tonight\". This is one of the few U.S. markets where \"Wheel\" and \"Jeopardy!\" are seen on separate TV stations—the latter airing on NBC affiliate WDTN. The highest quality surviving broadcast copy of \"The Star Wars Holiday Special\" is derived from this TV station. The Dayton Dragons began televising games on digital channel 7.2 (Time Warner Cable channels 23 and 372) on April 9, 2009, eventually airing 25 games per season. In the 2016 season, the Dragons telecasts moved to WBDT.\n\nWHIO-TV currently calls its team of meteorologists the \"Storm Center 7 weather team\". WHIO-TV bills its radar (which is powered by Baron Services) as \"Live Doppler 7\".\n\nWHIO-TV did not use its own professional meteorologists until 1993, with the hiring of Penn State meteorology graduate Heidi Sonen. The station dropped the AccuWeather service it had previously featured and hired other meteorologists to fill out the staff, including former Weather Channel meteorologist Fred Barnhill. USAF meteorologist Warren Madden was hired from nearby Wright-Patterson Air Force Base; he went to The Weather Channel in December, 1996.\n\nAfter Sonen's retirement in 1997, the station hired more Penn State graduates for the role of Chief Meteorologist, including Brian Orzel and Jamie Simpson.\n\nIn December 2004, the station introduced StormCenter 7, which is a weather center created by FX Group that doubles as a set where weather reports can be done.\n\nOn May 7, 2015, the station announced that it had hired Eric Elwell as its new chief meteorologist, with Brett Collar hired as the new weekend morning meteorologist. Both were announced to be starting in June, with all existing meteorologists at the station remaining, but in some cases being rotated on the schedule. Collar officially began on June 20, 2015, with Elwell's first day on June 29, 2015.\n\nOn November 19, 2018, WHIO-TV announced that it had hired McCall Vrydaghs as its chief meteorologist, effective immediately. Elwell would continue to work for the station as the meteorologist for the noon broadcast prior to leaving the station at the end of the year to move closer to his family in Columbus. Vrydaghs had been part of the team of meteorologists with the station since 2012. With Vrydaghs' promotion, Dontae Jones, who had previously been working as a morning meteorologist in North Carolina, also joined the team.\n\nOn June 29, 2007, WHIO-TV debuted its new doppler weather radar, initially billed as \"New Live Doppler 7\", currently called \"Live Doppler 7 HD\". The radar is available anytime on the station's website.\n\nOn December 15, 2006, WHIO-TV launched 7 Weather Now, programmed 24 hours a day, with a mix of frequently updated locally produced forecasts and content from the AccuWeather Channel. Live coverage of developing severe weather could be found on 7 Weather Now, as well as the latest watches and warnings. Weekday mornings from 7 to 8 a.m., the final hour of News Center 7 Daybreak was rebroadcast on the channel. Effective December 1, 2014, 7 Weather Now is no longer programmed on digital channel 7.2 but can be found as a live stream at the station's website and through the WHIO Weather mobile app.\n\nWHIO-TV began broadcasting its newscasts in a widescreen standard definition format on April 1, 2007; it was the first Ohio station outside of Cleveland to switch to this new format.\n\nIn the station's December 12, 2010 move to the Cox Media Center, all of its cameras, graphics and equipment were replaced with full high definition equipment. Beginning with that day's late-night newscast (which was delayed to 11:26 p.m. due to an overrun of CBS network programming), WHIO-TV began broadcasting all locally-shot portions of its newscasts — studio segments and live field reports — in high definition.\n\nWHIO-TV remained the only station in the Dayton area that broadcast local newscasts in high definition or 16:9 widescreen until July 21, 2012, when WDTN made the upgrade to HD. WKEF followed suit during a move to a new facility. Local commercials on WHIO-TV, however, continue to be stretched from their original 4:3 standard definition to widescreen dimensions.\n\nOn January 21, 2016, WHIO-TV debuted a new set, designed by FX Group.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1958732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958732", "title": "Ghibli Museum", "text": "Ghibli Museum\n\nThe is a museum showcasing the work of the Japanese animation studio Studio Ghibli. It is located in Inokashira Park in Mitaka, a western city of Tokyo, Japan. The museum combines features of a children's museum, technology museum, and a fine arts museum, and is dedicated to the art and technique of animation. Features include a replica of the Catbus from \"My Neighbor Totoro\" (1988), a café, bookstore, rooftop garden, and a theater for exclusive short films by Studio Ghibli.\n\nPlanning for the museum began in 1998. Construction started in March 2000. Upon completion, the museum opened on 1 October 2001.\n\nStudio Ghibli director Hayao Miyazaki designed the museum himself, using storyboards similar to the ones he creates for his films. The design was influenced by European architecture such as the hilltop village of Calcata in Italy. The museum features internal and external spiral staircases built from iron, interior bridges, and balconies stretching throughout the building's height. These stairways lead to exhibits, dead ends, and across bridges. These characteristics are meant to reflect Miyazaki's building designs displayed in his film work. Miyazaki's aim was to make the building itself part of the exhibit, and for the museum to be an uplifting and relaxing experience \"that makes you feel more enriched when you leave than when you entered\".\n\nPhotography and video recording is prohibited inside the museum, because the museum is described as a \"portal to a storybook world.\" Hayao Miyazaki's goal was also for people to experience the museum with their own eyes and ears.\n\n\"Let's get lost together\" is the museum's slogan, derived from Hayao Miyazaki's vision for visitors to immerse themselves in his imagination and film work.\n\nIn February 2020, the museum closed for an undisclosed period as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite efforts to reopen the Ghilbi Museum on 10 March 2020, the closure was later extended to 28 April.\n\nOn the bottom floor is an exhibit room showing the history and science of animation, including a three-dimensional zoetrope named \"Bouncing Totoro\", with models of characters from \"My Neighbor Totoro\" (1988). On the first floor is a mock-up of an animation studio. Called \"Where a Film is Born,\" the five-room exhibit is meant to showcase the creative process of an animation filmmaker such as illustration techniques. Packed with books and toys, the room also displays drawings and illustrations that cover the walls. Another exhibit demonstrates the process of creating an animated film, with sketches, storyboarding, keyframing, cleanup, coloring and background painting.\n\nIn addition to Ghibli-oriented exhibitions, the museum hosts an area showcasing work from other studios.\n\nThe Ghibli Museum shows several short films exclusive to the Ghibli museum. Located in the basement of the museum is The Saturn Theater. The theater has windows where automated shades lower and open before and after each showing of its short films. This is because Hayao Miyazaki designed the theater with small children in mind, who could possibly be scared of the closed in theater. The museum shows one of the following Ghibli short-films in the Saturn Theatre:\n\nEach guest to the museum is only permitted to watch the short film once during a single visit.\n\nTri Hawks is a reading room and bookstore in the Ghibli Museum. Opened on February 6, 2002, it is filled with books recommended by Hayao Miyazaki. \"Mi-taka,\" the city where the Ghibli Museum is located, means three hawks. The name Tri Hawks comes from a pun based on the city's name.\n\nMamma Aiuto, on the top of the Ghibli Museum, is the souvenir gift shop named after the band of sky pirates in the movie \"Porco Rosso\". The name Mamma Aiuto translates to \"mama, help me\" in Italian, which was where \"Porco Rosso\" was set. Among other items, it sells classic and non-Japanese animation movies under the eponymous Ghibli Museum Library label.\n\nThe Straw Hat Café is the Ghibli Museum's only sit-down restaurant. It was created with the help of a housewife who is a mother of four; Miyazaki wanted the café's food to be \"a kind of home cooking\". The Café serves hot and cold foods, snacks, and desserts. Sold at the takeout section is an original alcoholic beverage: \"Valley of the Wind\" beer. The beer was created by a collaboration with Dairy Kingdom Oratche, a microbrewery in Tanna Basin. The beverage's label was hand drawn by Gorō Miyazaki, Hayao Miyazaki's son, who is an animation director at Studio Ghibli as well.\n\nThere is a playroom for children age 12 and below with a giant Catbus toy to play in. In order for the Catbus to fit in the museum it had to be downsized from the original film scale as seen in \"My Neighbor Totoro\" (1988).\n\nOn the museum's roof is a garden with a life-size, five meter tall statue of a robot from the final episode of \"Lupin III Part II and \"Castle in the Sky\".\nThe Robot Soldier was made by the artist Kunio Shachimaru. The statue is formed from hammered copper plate and took 2 years to create. The keystone from the movie \"Castle in the Sky\" can be found here. The keystone, bearing an inscription in Old Persian cuneiform, is a replica of the control room stone found in the floating castle, Laputa, in the movie \"Castle in the Sky\".\n\nTickets to the Ghibli Museum are only accepted if bought in advance. These reserve tickets can be purchased outside Japan in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, North America, Europe, and Australia, and on internet by the LAWSON Ticket Online Shop, or via one of the authorized JTB Corporation locations for the respective region. Tickets go on sale on the tenth day of each month at 9:00 AM local time for reservations the following month. Reservations are strictly for the date and time purchased, and cannot be changed once booked. Tickets range from ¥1,000 for adults to ¥700 for ages thirteen to eighteen year olds, ¥400 for ages seven to twelve year olds, and ¥100 for ages four to six year olds. Ages four years old and under are free. At the museum's entry, the reserve tickets are exchanged for a 35mm film strip that features a scene from one of the Studio Ghibli films.\n\nAt the entrance of the building, the museum's ceiling is covered in a fresco painting. The painting features characters from the Studio Ghibli films such as Kiki on her broomstick from the film \"Kiki's Delivery Service\" (1989).\n\n"}

Transmitter power is 10,000 watts daytime, 5,000 watts nighttime. Broadcast frequency is 980 kHz (AM). CFPL uses a four-tower directional antenna with differing patterns during the day and night. The station primarily airs news and talk programming. The studios are located in downtown London while its transmitter is located south of London at Wellington Road and Scotland Drive.\n\nOriginally CJGC, the station first went on the air at approximately 698 kHz, at a time when wavelength was usually used rather than frequency. It later changed to 910 kHz, then, to avoid interference from a Mexican station at 909, moved to 595 kHz, which it maintained until it merged with CKOK Windsor to become CKLW in April 1933. During the 1920s and early 1930s, CJGC airtime was used from time to time by CNRL, a phantom station of the Canadian National Railways.\n\nIn September 1933, the merger was dissolved and a new transmitter at 730 kHz went on the air with the call sign CFPL. The station was an affiliate of the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission from 1933 to 1936 when it became an affiliate of the new Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. It was an affiliate of the CBC's Dominion Network from 1944 to 1962 before that network was integrated into CBC Radio. The station changed frequency in 1941 to 1570 kHz, and in February 1949 it changed to 980 kHz. Like many other stations, it had to reduce transmitter power during the night.\n\nThe station aired mostly music geared to older generations, and during the 1970s and early 1980s, used holiday weekends to play \"the unforgettables\" - music from bygone eras, and the \"Saturday Night Dance Party\" (three, later four, hours) aired big band music. Newscasts were major for CFPL, including the prime weekday coverage of \"Noonwatch\" from 12 to 1, with local, national and agricultural coverage. The station carried CBC newscasts at 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., and CBC network programs from 6:30 to 10 p.m., plus a limited amount of weekend programming, some of it delayed to a later hour. A significant program feature during the 1960s and 1970s was the \"Open Line\" each weekday morning from 6 to 10, mostly hosted by Bill Brady, allowing listeners to call in about nearly anything, and which served as a community bulletin board during winter storms, carrying information about cancellation of school classes and other events.\nThe CBC affiliation continued until 1978, when CBC established CBCL-FM on 93.5 MHz, a rebroadcast transmitter of CBL in Toronto. The station played middle of the road and adult contemporary music into the late 1990s (and featured Top 40 music in some dayparts during the 1960s), but has since transitioned to 100% news/talk/sports.\n\nOn November 27, 2017, CFPL rebranded as \"Global News Radio 980 AM\".\n\n"}

The term derives from similar ones in geology, horizon or marker horizon, but where these have natural causes, archaeological horizons are caused by man. Most typically there is a change in the type of pottery found, and in the style of less frequent major artefacts. Across a horizon the same type of artefact or style is found very widely over a large area, and it can be assumed that these traces are approximately contemporary.\n\nThe term is used to denote a series of stratigraphic relationships that constitute a phase, or are part of the process of determining the archaeological phases of a site. An archaeological horizon can be understood as a break in contexts formed in the Harris matrix, which denotes a change in epoch on a given site by delineation in time of finds found within contexts. \nAn example of a horizon is the dark earth horizon in England, which separates Roman artefacts from medieval artefacts and which may indicate the abandonment of urban areas in Roman Britain during the 2nd to 5th centuries. The term 'archaeological horizon' is sometimes, and somewhat incorrectly, used in place of the term layer or strata.\n\nIn the archaeology of the Americas \"Horizon\" terminology, used as proper names, has become used for schemes of periodization of major periods. \"Horizons\" are periods of cultural stability and political unity, with \"Intermediate periods\" covering the politically fragmented transition between them. In the periodization of pre-Columbian Peru and the Central Andes there are three Horizon periods, with two Intermediate periods between them. The Horizons, and their dominant cultures are: Early Horizon, Chavin; Middle Horizon, Tiwanaku and Wari culture; Late Horizon, Inca. \n\nThe same terms (Early, Middle and Late Horizons) are sometimes used for the Mesoamerican chronology, though there the five stages defined by Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips in 1958 remain dominant, and the Formative stage, Classic stage and Post-Classic stage cover approximately similar periods. More commonly lower-case horizons such as an \"Olmec horizon\" are referred to for the region.\n\n\n"}

One of the most popular attractions in the Magic Kingdom, the Haunted Mansion, is located in this land. Presiding over the square is the Hall of Presidents, an American history show featuring an audio-animatronic figure of every President of the United States. Liberty Square has a long waterfront on the Rivers of America and the \"Liberty Belle\" Riverboat steam paddleboat departs from a landing here. The land affords excellent views of the river and Tom Sawyer Island in adjacent Frontierland.\n\nOriginally conceived as an annex to Main Street U.S.A. for Disneyland in Anaheim, the idea was revisited when the Magic Kingdom was being designed in the late 1960s. The need arose for an area analogous to, but distinct from, New Orleans Square at Disneyland. Walt Disney Imagineering decided on an early American, eighteenth century theme, with special concentration on the American Revolutionary War, as the Bicentennial would occur soon in 1976.\n\nLiberty Square opened as part of the Magic Kingdom and Walt Disney World's grand opening on October 1, 1971 as one of the original six themed lands. It is located in the northwest corner, bordering Fantasyland and Frontierland. The Square also has bridges to the park's central hub, as well as Adventureland. Forming its western border is the Rivers of America, on which the Liberty Belle travels. It is also the smallest land by guest area in the Magic Kingdom.\nAs of 2007, it is the only land yet to undergo a major refurbishment. All of the attractions, original from October 1, 1971, still exist in some form or another. No major additions have been made. The theming in the Square is comprehensive and accurate to the time period, from major architectural and engineering homages to the small antiques and artifacts peppered throughout the many attractions and dining locations.\n\nOn July 28, 2016, it was announced that a new live show, \"The Muppets Present…Great Moments in American History\" starring the Muppets would be coming to the area outside Hall of Presidents in October 2016. The show takes place throughout the day, with the Muppets sharing their own take on American history and a new song.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This is in contrast to a continuous mechanism, whereby the film is constantly in motion and the image is held steady by optical or electronic methods. The reason the intermittent mechanism \"works\" for the viewer is because of a phenomenon called persistence of vision. \n\nIntermittent mechanisms were first used in sewing machines, in order for the fabric to be fed through correctly - ensuring it is stationary as each stitch is made, while moving the required distance between stitches.\n\nThe intermittent mechanism must be employed in concert with a rotating shutter which blocks light transmittance during the motion of the film and allows light through while the film is held in place usually by one or more registration pins. The intermittent mechanism can be accomplished in many ways, but most often, it is done with sprocket wheels, claws, or pins coupled to the camera or projector drive mechanism. \n\nIn movie theater projectors, the intermittent movement is often produced by a Geneva drive (Maltese cross mechanism).\n\nHowever, in a movie camera, it is done through a process by which a shutter opens exposing the film negative to light for a split second (the standard for regular motion in North America is 1/48 of a second, which corresponds to 180 degrees, but shutters with 200 degrees were popular back when the then-available color negative film had an ASA of 50; today's color negative film is available with an ASA of 500), then the shutter closes blocking light from reaching the negative. Once the shutter is completely closed, a claw pulls down the next film frame of negative film by the sprocket holes into the film gate and the process begins again.

The three benzene rings can be drawn as the three outer rings, with the central ring formed by one face of each and the three carbon–carbon single bonds.\n\nBeing a fully benzenoid PAH means that triphenylene is much more resonance stable than its isomers chrysene, benz[\"a\"]anthracene, benzo[\"c\"]phenanthrene, and tetracene. This makes it much more difficult to hydrogenate to the saturated hydrocarbon.\n\nIn light of these characteristics, triphenylene may have uses in optics and electronics.

Consisting of colorless needle-like crystals, it emits bluish purple fluorescence by UV irradiation.\n\nIn terms of its crystallographic point group, the symmetry of triphenylene is classified as \"D\" in Schoenflies notation. Because of these characteristics, six-fold (in the 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, and 11 positions) alkyloxy- or alkylthiol-substituted triphenylenes can be used as a discotic mesogen in liquid crystalline materials.\n\n"}

In childhood, she imbibed anti-British prejudices, and her patriotic sympathies were so stirred in childhood by the story of the destruction of tea cargoes in Boston harbour, that she resolved never to drink tea, and kept the resolution all her life. She already possessed a beautiful voice of great compass and volume, and took a few singing lessons at the age of eleven from Signor Abella in New York. When she was sixteen her father was ruined by the reduction in 1857 of the import duties in the protective tariff, and died; she went to the state of Mississippi as a teacher, and after a time gave singing lessons.\n\nWhen the civil war broke out her position became very unpleasant, and with another northern girl she fled by night during the summer of 1862, and was guided north by friendly negroes. Afterwards she became a church singer and was engaged in Henry Ward Beecher's church at Brooklyn, where a special throne-like seat was erected for her. In 1868, she came to Europe for further training; she sang at Darlington in Handel's \"Messiah\" on 17 December, and elsewhere, taking some lessons under W. H. Cummings in London before proceeding to Germany.\n\nThere she studied under Pauline Viardot-Garcia, and finally under Manuel Garcia in London. In 1871, she returned to America and became a prominent concert singer. Her voice had settled into a true contralto of exceptional power and richness. She came back to England at the beginning of 1873 where she made her debut in the Covent Garden Promenade Concerts and became popular for singing ballads and Scotch songs.\n\nHer first engagement in London was at the promenade concert of 6 November 1873; the programmes were then distinctly popular, with a tendency towards vulgarity; she insisted, in spite of all expostulations, in singing the 'Slumber Song' from Bach's \"Christmas Oratorio\" and some classical Lieder. She obtained great popular success, and enthusiastic receptions on her appearance at the Crystal Palace, the Albert Hall, Exeter Hall, and St. James's Hall quickly followed. \n\nIn February 1874, she sang in Mendelssohn's \"Elijah\" on two consecutive nights at Exeter Hall and Royal Albert Hall. Her repertory was entirely oratorio music or German Lieder. Dissentient voices were not lacking; 'her style is wanting in sensibility and refinement. Excellence of voice is not all that is required in the art of vocalisation' (Athenæum, 14 March). Her popularity was undeniable, and she was engaged for the three choirs festival at Hereford. On Easter Sunday 1875, she was married at the Savoy Chapel to John MacKinlay, a Scottish American; they settled in Stanhope Place, London.\nEngagements for high-class concerts gradually ceased, but she still for some years sang in oratorio, and her taste remained faithful to the German school, including Wagner. In 1877, she found her vocation. Arthur Sullivan's 'The Lost Chord' exactly suited her, and attained unprecedented popularity. She became more and more restricted to simple sentimental ballads, especially those with semi-religious or moralising words, which she declaimed with perfect distinctness and intense fervour. She invested 'Caller Herrin'' with singular significance. In her later years she favoured Tennyson's 'Crossing the Bar' in Behrend's setting.\nShe had always leant to eccentricity, refusing to wear a low-necked dress, and getting permission to dispense with one at a command performance before Queen Victoria. She never wore a corset. After belonging to various sects, she at last became a believer in Christian science. In 1893, she made an Australian tour, during which her husband died at Adelaide. In 1895, she revisited America, but did not feel at home there, and soon returned to London.\nIn the winter of 1902-3 her farewell tour was announced. Her last appearance was at East Ham on 15 October 1903, and the last song which she sang was 'Crossing the Bar.' She died at her residence in Hampstead on 10 January 1904, and was cremated at Golder's Green.\n\nShe was survived by a son and a daughter, both popular vocalists at the time. \nAfter her death, her son, Malcolm Sterling Mackinlay (1876–1952) wrote her life in \"Antoinette Sterling and Other Celebrities\" (1906 Hutchinson). \nHer son's daughter was the romance novelist Leila S. Mackinlay, named in her honour.\n"}
{"id": "1958790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958790", "title": "Landfill gas", "text": "Landfill gas\n\nLandfill gas is a complex mix of different gases created by the action of microorganisms within a landfill. Landfill gas is approximately forty to sixty percent methane, with the remainder being mostly carbon dioxide. Trace amounts of other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) comprise the remainder (<1%). These trace gases include a large array of species, mainly simple hydrocarbons.\n\nLandfill gases have an influence on climate change. The major components are CO and methane, both of which are greenhouse gas. Methane in the atmosphere is a far more potent greenhouse gas, with each molecule having twenty five times the effect of a molecule of carbon dioxide. Methane itself however accounts for less composition of the atmosphere than does carbon dioxide. Landfills are the third largest source of methane in the US.\n\nLandfill gases are the result of three processes:\nThe first two depend strongly on the nature of the waste. The dominant process in most landfills is the third process whereby anaerobic bacteria decompose organic waste to produce biogas, which consists of methane and carbon dioxide together with traces of other compounds. Despite the heterogeneity of waste, the evolution of gases follows well defined kinetic pattern. Formation of methane and CO commences about six months after depositing the landfill material. The evolution of gas reaches a maximum at about 20 years, then declines over the course of decades.\n\nBecause gases produced by landfills are both valuable and sometimes hazardous, monitoring techniques have been developed. Flame ionization detectors can be used to measure methane levels as well as total VOC levels. Surface monitoring and sub-surface monitoring as well as monitoring of the ambient air is carried out. In the U.S., under the Clean Air Act of 1990, it is required that many large landfills install gas collection and control systems, which means that at the very least the facilities must collect and flare the gas.\n\nU.S. Federal regulations under Subtitle D of RCRA formed in October 1979 regulate the siting, design, construction, operation, monitoring, and closure of MSW landfills. Subtitle D now requires controls on the migration of methane in landfill gas. Monitoring requirements must be met at landfills during their operation, and for an additional 30 years after. The landfills affected by Subtitle D of RCRA are required to control gas by establishing a way to check for methane emissions periodically and therefore prevent off-site migration. Landfill owners and operators must make sure the concentration of methane gas does not exceed 25% of the LEL for methane in the facilities' structures and the LEL for methane at the facility boundary.\n\nA United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report indicates that as of 2016, counts of operational municipal solid waste landfills range between 1,900 and 2,000. In a nation-wide study done by the Environmental Research and Education Foundation in 2013, only 1,540 operational municipal solid waste landfills were counted throughout the United States. Decomposing waste in these landfills produce landfill gas, which is a mixture of about half methane and half carbon dioxide. Landfills are the third largest source of methane emissions in the United States, with municipal solid waste landfills representing 95 percent of this fraction.\n\nThe gases produced within a landfill can be collected and used in various ways. The landfill gas can be utilized directly on site by a boiler or any type of combustion system, providing heat. Electricity can also be generated on site through the use of microturbines, steam turbines, or fuel cells. The landfill gas can also be sold off site and sent into natural gas pipelines. This approach requires the gas to be processed into pipeline quality, e.g., by removing various contaminants and components. The efficiency of gas collection at landfills directly impacts the amount of energy that can be recovered - closed landfills (those no longer accepting waste) collect gas more efficiently than open landfills (those that are still accepting waste). A comparison of collection efficiency at closed and open landfills found about a 17 percentage point difference between the two.\n\nLandfill gas can also be used to evaporate leachate, another byproduct of the landfill process. This application displaces another fuel that was previously used for the same thing. \nIn the U.S., the number of landfill gas projects increased from 399 in 2005, to 594 in 2012 according to the Environmental Protection Agency. These projects are popular because they control energy costs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These projects collect the methane gas and treat it, so it can be used for electricity or upgraded to pipeline-grade gas. (Methane gas has twenty-one times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide). For example, in the U.S., Waste Management uses landfill gas as an energy source at 110 landfill gas-to-energy facilities. This energy production offsets almost two million tons of coal per year, creating energy equivalent to that needed by four hundred thousand homes. These projects also reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.\n\nThe EPA, which estimates that hundreds of landfills could support gas to energy projects, has also established the Landfill Methane Outreach Program. This program was developed to reduce methane emissions from landfills in a cost-effective manner by encouraging the development of environmentally and economically beneficial landfill gas-to-energy projects.\n\nCapture and use of landfill gas can be expensive. Some environmental groups claim that the projects do not produce \"renewable power\" because trash (their source) is not renewable. The Sierra Club opposes government subsidies for such projects. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) argues that government incentives should be directed more towards solar, wind, and energy-efficiency efforts.\n\nWhen landfill gas permeates through a soil cover, a fraction of the methane in the gas is oxidized microbially to CO.\n\nLandfill gas emissions can lead to environmental, hygiene and security problems in the landfill. Several accidents have occurred, for example at Loscoe, England in 1986, where migrating landfill gas accumulated and partially destroyed a property. An accident causing two deaths occurred from an explosion in a house adjacent to Skellingsted landfill in Denmark in 1991. Due to the risk presented by landfill gas, there is a clear need to monitor gas produced by landfills. In addition to the risk of fire and explosion, gas migration in the subsurface can result in contact of landfill gas with groundwater. This, in turn, can result in contamination of groundwater by organic compounds present in nearly all landfill gas.\n\nAlthough usually evolved only in trace amounts, landfills do release some aromatics and chlorocarbons.\n\nLandfill gas migration, due to pressure differentials and diffusion, can occur. This can create an explosion hazard if the gas reaches sufficiently high concentrations in adjacent buildings.\n\n\n"}

The club was founded in 1985 as a result of a merger under the name Le Mans Union Club 72. In 2010, Le Mans changed its name to Le Mans FC to coincide with the re-modeling of the club, which includes moving into a new stadium, MMArena, which opened in January 2011. The stadium is based in the interior of the famous circuit in the city.\n\nThe club were controversially relegated from 2019–20 Ligue 2 when the season was terminated early due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLe Mans Sports Club were founded in 1900, but it was not until 1908 that a football club existed within it. In 1910, Le Mans qualified for the Championnat de la France in 1910, but were heavily overturned by Saint-Servan. Gaining a huge reputation up to World War I, Le Mans SC plunged into obscurity by World War II before joining the war league in 1942.\n\nThe football section of Union Sportive du Mans was founded in 1903.\n\nThe current club was formed as a result of a merger between Union Sportive du Mans and Le Mans Sports Club, on 12 June 1985. Upon its foundation, former football player Bernard Deferrez was installed as manager. Le Mans UC spent the majority of its infancy in Ligue 2. In the 2003–04 season, the club achieved promotion to Ligue 1 for the first time, but were immediately relegated. Le Mans returned to the first division for the 2005–06 season and successfully remained in the league for the next four seasons. The club suffered relegated back to Ligue 2 in the 2009–10 season. Midway through the campaign, on 2 December 2009, Le Mans announced that it was changing its name from Le Mans Union Club 72 to Le Mans FC.\n\nLe Mans moved to the MMArena midway through the 2010–11 season, comfortably in the promotion spots for a return to Ligue 1, but a bad run sees them finish 4th, missing promotion on goal difference. The failure to achieve promotion is costly, as the club sees its payroll limited by the DNCG. Many players leave, and relegation is only narrowly avoided. The club survives by appeal an attempt by DNCG to relegate them to Championnat National. The following season they are relegated on the field, and a long summer of legal battles sees them liquidated and reforming in Maine (province) Division d'Honneur as an amateur club.\n\nPromotion to Championnat de France Amateur 2 was achieved at the first attempt, and promotion from that division was only narrowly missed in 2014–15 and 2015–16. At the third attempt, promotion to the new Championnat National 2 was obtained in 2016–17, when Le Mans finished as one of the best runners up in the competition. Le Mans was promoted for the second season in a row winning Group D and being promoted to the 2018–19 Championnat National, the club would achieve a third consecutive promotion after successfully overcoming Gazélec Ajaccio in the Ligue 2 relegation play-off final with a 3-2 aggregate score, swapping places with the Corsican club who, only three years before had been members of the top-flight themselves.\n\nThe club were in 19th place in Ligue 2 when the season was terminated early due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the club supporting an LFP proposal which would have seen Ligue 2 operate temporarily with 22 clubs, meaning they would stay in the division, the FFF ruled on 27 May 2020 that they were to be relegated to Championnat National.\n\n\"As of 31 January 2020\"\n\nBelow are the notable former players who have represented Le Mans and its predecessors in league and international competition since the club's foundation in 1985.

It was founded in 1986, as the third professional club from the city, after ASTS and TAF. They won the Intertoto Cup in 2001, beating Newcastle United on the away goals rule after the score was 4–4 on aggregate.\n\nThe first ever football club in Troyes was created in 1900, as Union Sportive Troyenne (UST). In 1931, it merged with the AS Savinienne, a club from the suburbs of Troyes, to form the Association Sportive Troyenne et Savinienne (ASTS). The newly formed club became professional in 1935, and joined Ligue 2.\nThe club reached Première Division in 1954/55, under the guidance of manager and former international player Roger Courtois (1952–1963), with players such as Abdelaziz Ben Tifour, Marcel Artelesa or Pierre Flamion. It constituted one of the more glorious times for the club, as they reached the Coupe de France final in 1956, against CS Sedan Ardennes, which they went on to lose 3–1. The same day, the youth team of the club won the Coupe Gambardella, the French Youth cup. That very same year, the club failed to keep its place in French top flight, and was back in Division 2. It finally succeed in reaching the Première Division again in 1960, but only lasted one season, and was relegated in 1961. The club had some financial difficulties, and had to leave professional football at the end of the 1962–1963 season, which they finished 17th out of 20. They continued for four more seasons at regional level, under the guidance of former ASTS player Jacques Diebold, before disappearing.\n\nShortly after without any major club in Troyes, a new one was created in 1967, under the name Troyes Omnisports, still at regional level. It renamed itself Troyes Aube Football (TAF) in 1970 as it took back professional status, and was admitted to play in the Third Division. They were promoted to the Second Division after just one year. For their first season in Second division, under the lead of Pierre Flamion, they finished second, but failed to win promotion, as there were three Second division groups that season. They finished first next year, in 1973, and lost in the Champions final between the Champions of the two new groups against RC Lens.\nThe club had its longest consecutive run in Ligue 1, as they stayed five consecutive seasons in the top flight, from 1973 to 1978. It was however a difficult spell, as it struggled each season against relegation. Pierre Flamion left in 1975, and was replaced by René Cédolin, former Stade Rennais manager. Its best position was 15th out of 20 in 1976–1977. Even though they had some very good players, such as striker Gérard Tonnel (1972–1975, 107 games, 69 goals in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2), right-back René Le Lamer (1973–1978), keeper Guy Formici (1970–1978) and Yugoslavian star, winger Ilija Petković (1973–1976). They were finally relegated in 1978, finishing 19th.\nThey suffered back to back relegations finishing 17th in the second division and dropped to the third division. This led to the club becoming bankrupt and merging with Patronage Laïque de Troyes, leaving Troyes without a professional Football Club yet again.\n\nAfter the death of the second professional club from Troyes, some people tried to rebuild a new club, which could be able to come back to professional status. At first, in 1979, just after the disappearing of the TAF, they merged the amateurs teams the TAF with the Patronage Laïque de Troyes, creating the PL Foot, once again under the guidance of Jacques Diebold. The club only managed to reach the Fourth division in 1984, but became relegated after just one season, finishing 17th.\nTo build a more lasting club, Maurice Cacciaguerra, Angel Masoni and others decided to create the Association Troyes Aube Champagne (ATAC), taking the place of the PL Foot in Division d'Honneur, French sixth division, at regional level. \n\nThe new club won the championship in its first season, and was promoted to Fourth division in 1987. After just three seasons, they finished first of the Fourth Division in 1990, and reached the Third Division. Despite being well listed during the next three seasons, the club failed to gain promotion to the Second division. Due to the reform of French football leagues in 1993, the club was transferred to the newly formed Nationale 2, the new fourth level of French football. New president Angel Masoni called Alain Perrin to take the lead of the team. He was to become the most successful manager ever in Troyes, and stayed nine years, from 1993 to 2002.\nIn his first year, he won the Nationale 2, and ATAC was promoted to the Nationale 1 in 1994. The following year, Troyes finished 10th, before finishing 2nd in 1995–1996, and was promoted to Ligue 2: for the first time since 1979, Troyes were playing professional football.\n\nTroyes first season was very difficult, as they finished 20th out of 22 teams, only keeping its place in Deuxième division due to the bankruptcy of FC Perpignan and FCO Charleville. The next two seasons were much more successful, they finished 5th in 1997–1998, and 3rd in 1998–1999, due to the presence of players more used to this level, such as Frédéric Adam, Richard Jeziersky, David Hamed, Samuel Boutal, fans favourite Slađan Đukić and local players, such as captain Mohammed Bradja. Troyes took the lead during the first part of the season. Even if the second part was more difficult, the team finished third, only on goal average, after a last win against AS Cannes. But most importantly Troyes was promoted to Ligue 1, 21 years after its last season at this level.\n\nIn Troyes' first season in Ligue 1 in 1999/2000, the team finished in 14th place, thereby avoiding relegation. At the end of the season, the name ATAC was changed to ESTAC due to the complaints of a French discount supermarket chain having the same name. The glory days came in the next two seasons, as they twice finished seventh, qualifying them for the first time in their history for the Intertoto Cup in 2001 and 2002. In 2001, with players Jérôme Rothen, Rafik Saïfi, Tony Heurtebis, Fabio Celestini and Nicolas Goussé in the side, they defeated Newcastle United in an epic Intertoto Cup second leg final, which finished 4–4 at St James' Park. \n\nAfter a first round qualification in UEFA Cup over Slovakian MFK Ruzomberok (6–1; 0–1), they lost to Leeds United 4-5 on aggregate despite having won the second leg 3–2, and failed to qualify to the third round. The following year, they beat Spanish side Villareal CF, drawing 0–0 in the first leg and winning the second leg 2–1. However, the result was voided as Troyes fielded a disqualified player, David Vairelles. UEFA disqualified ESTAC, and Villareal took their place instead. The sacking of new manager Jacky Bonnevay and the nomination of Faruk Hadzibegic in January did not save Troyes. They finished at the bottom of the Ligue 1, and were relegated to Ligue 2.\n\nThanks to the takeover of new President Thierry Gomez, Troyes avoided bankruptcy to finish 10th the following season. In 2004 Jean-Marc Furlan, who had spectacular results in Coupe de France with amateur side Libourne Saint-Seurin, was appointed manager. In his first season, the club secured promotion by finishing third, largely due to the great performances of two young strikers on loan, Sébastien Grax from AS Monaco and Bafétimbi Gomis from AS Saint-Etienne. The club played some attractive football, in the style of former manager Alain Perrin. The club maintained itself in Ligue 1 in 2005–2006, but failed the following season (2006–07), finishing in 18th position. Furlan left at the end of the season, and Denis Troch became the new manager. After failing to win promotion, with Troyes taking only 4 points in the last 11 games of the season and finishing in 6th place despite being in the top three during the majority of the season, Troch was sacked at the conclusion of the season. Ludovic Batelli was appointed next season, but had to struggle against relegation. He was sacked in April 2009 and caretaker manager, Claude Robin, previously Troyes' director of formation, did not manage to avoid relegation.\n\nWith the club finding itself once again in financial difficulties, Thierry Gomez stepped down as president and was replaced by Daniel Masoni, son of former president Angel Masoni. In July 2009 Daniel Masoni engaged Patrick Rémy to replace Robin as manager. Rémy succeeded in taking Troyes back to Ligue 2, finishing third in the Championnat National in 2010. However, after a disagreement with president Masoni, Remy quit in June 2010 and Jean-Marc Furlan returned to manage the club. The club stayed in Ligue 2 in the 2010–2011 season, finishing 16th.\nAfter a slow start at the beginning of the new season, results improved as the season went on. Things improved greatly and Troyes found themselves challenging for promotion. They achieved this in the 37th game of the season, with a win over AS Monaco, on 11 May 2012. Crucial wins over arch-rivals Sedan, with a goal in the last minute to right back youngster Djibril Sidibé, and then a few weeks later against Clermont, who was third at the time, allowed Troyes to climb into the top three. \n\nProducing some of the most exciting football of the league, with players such as Marcos or Mounir Obbadi, a strong defence led by Rincón, Julien Outrebon, Matthieu Saunier and Stephen Drouin with the left back Fabrice N'Sakala and right back Djibril Sidibé, both products of the Academy, as well as midfielders Julien Faussurier and captain Eloge Enza Yamissi actually did what nobody expected at the beginning of the season. They had a strong second half of the season, with only 4 defeats, 5 draws and 10 victories (with just one loss in the 10 last games of the season). Troyes found themselves back in Ligue 1 five years after their last stint, and just two season after playing in the third division.\n\nIn the 2015-16 Ligue 1 season, Troyes were relegated to Ligue 2 after finishing last on the table winning only three games all year and were humiliated in one match when they lost 9-0 at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain. On 29 May 2017, Troyes were promoted back to Ligue 1 at the first time of asking after defeating Lorient 2-1 on aggregate in the playoff/relegation match. On 20 May 2018, Troyes were relegated back to Ligue 2 after just one season in the top flight, finishing second from bottom.\n\nIn the 2018–19 Ligue 2 season, Troyes finished in third place on the table. Troyes would go on to lose the playoff semi final against RC Lens 2–1 after extra time.\n\n\"As of 28 February 2019.\" \n\n\"For a complete list of former Troyes AC players with a Wikipedia article, see .\"\n\n"}

Political support or political capital, such as nationalism or ethnic conflict also decide foreign intervention actions such as occupation, nation-building and national security policies.\n\nThe objectives of a policy for foreign intervention can be philosophical, religious or scientific based on the different ideological foundations supporting the policy.\n\nExample of objectives are national security, scientific systemic concern of systemic bias in international relations theory, policy of balancing as a goal for balance of power in international relations or balance of threat.\n\nInternational relations are developed through international cooperation and international organizations giving rise to military alliance, cooperation through a trade pact or development of a trade bloc. These can set common policies of foreign intervention through bilateralism or multilateralism, and international agreement on a treaty.\n\nThe development of international law is also done through international cooperation and organizations with implications for \"foreign intervention\" actions.\n\nThere are varying methods on foreign intervention from participants including government, military, international, corporate, religious and public efforts reflecting their respective objectives, interests and ideologies.\n\nForeign intervention methods that are physically passive and do not use violence are non-aggressive.\n\nNon-aggressive methods include sanctions like economic sanctions, embargo, boycott, trade sanctions, political sanctions, international sanctions.\n\nAdditionally, media or information methods, including information warfare, propaganda, advertising, political symbolism, media democracy, and freedom of information may be used to gain political capital and support for political reform.\n\nPublicly organized efforts such as the peace movement and nonviolence organizations are also part of this definition.

Political doctrines are often the expressed views for such belief systems, such as a foreign policy doctrine (usually of \"philosophical\" origin) or like the \"Doctrine for Just War\" (of \"religious\" origin). Military science through military doctrine and military strategy also include geopolitical strategy.\n\nInternational relations theory is the \"scientific\" study of such policies, methods and paradigms resulting in scientific modelling through the interdisciplinary fields of systems philosophy and systems science.\n\nSome central philosophical and systemic topics on foreign intervention and war studies include:\n\nThe non-aggression principle holds that aggression is inherently illegitimate, but does not preclude defence against aggression.\n\nMarxist international relations theory and later World-systems approach are essentially opposing any policies of domination or hegemony such as \"world domination\". The idea of complex interdependence argue that the decline of military force as a policy tool, the increase in economic and other forms of interdependence should increase the probability of cooperation among states.\n\nSome theories that promote less aggressive foreign intervention are:\n\nTheories openly supporting explicitly aggressive foreign intervention are:\n\nPolitical realism states that the overriding 'national interest' of each state is its national security and survival; as well as that to ensure this security, states must be on constant preparation for conflict through economic and military build-up. Ruhollah Khomeini believed in Muslim unity and social solidarity, as well as the export of Islamic revolution throughout the world: \"Establishing the Islamic state world-wide belong to the great goals of the revolution.\"\n\nExamples of Foreign policy doctrines include the Bush Doctrine, the Monroe Doctrine, the Stimson Doctrine, the Truman Doctrine, the Eisenhower Doctrine, the Nixon Doctrine, the Brezhnev Doctrine, and the Kirkpatrick Doctrine.\n\nNazi Germany Geopolitik and United States Realpolitik are also examples of practical policies. Foreign intervention may result in a declaration of war or state of emergency.\n\nEfforts in foreign intervention may include diplomacy to dispute resolution. The involved parties in a conflict may negotiate a peace treaty or other treaties. A state may operate as a protecting power on behalf of other states, offering foreign intervention capabilities. This is usually done by a neutral country.\n\nInternational conventions may be reached by an international consensus. Ideas of equal power relationship and pacifism are sometimes used in diplomacy. Towards the end of the Cold War there was a public rationale and reasoning for a peace dividend with economic benefits of a \"decrease in defence spending\".\n\nThe most frequently used multilateral alternative is a policy through the United Nations Security Council, often for peacekeeping initiatives. There is also an International Police.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) also participates, for example through combating terrorist financing. This is also the case for Interpol. Other organisations are the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and NATO.\n\nCanada's International Policy Statement is an example of a multilateral policy.\n\nThroughout the last century there has been several unilateral and covert efforts by the United States like Operation Gladio, School of the Americas and other CIA activities in the Americas.\n\nThe Bush Doctrine and United States realpolitik are seen as promoting unilateral foreign intervention. There are also programs like the extraordinary rendition by the United States in the asymmetric warfare nature of the War on Terrorism.\n\nDuring the war in North-West Pakistan there are further Effects-Based Operations in a low intensity conflict, selective assassinations and a manhunt (military) for Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe United States also defines a list of State Sponsors of Terrorism and an Axis of evil which are subject to various US foreign intervention policies like sanctions.\n\nDuring the 2008 South Ossetia war there were privately hired military veterans from Israel giving military education and training; as well as other official military aid such as military advisors from the United States and Israel to the Georgian military. Later Russia intervened in this conflict in order to protect the ethnic minority group in South Ossetia, and later expressed NATO expansionism concerns.\n\nThere are controversies to foreign interventionism policies with accusations of hegemony and world domination through expansionism or imperialism.\n\nSome social criticism is directed as anti-imperialism. Others warn that militarism and inflated military spending will result in a permanent war economy. Critics of appeasement say it can result in world war. Also, Finlandization is the process of turning into a neutral country which, although maintaining national sovereignty, in foreign politics resolves not to challenge a more powerful neighbour. Ethnic conflict can result in Balkanization.\n\nMilitary intervention can result in accusations of war crimes like ethnic cleansing or genocide. The International Court of Justice handles some cases of such abuse.\nThere is also public criticism on collateral damage in conflicts such as public infrastructure and civilian casualties. According to Choi and James (2014), Human-rights violations are the primary cause of U.S Military interventions.\n\nThere are allegations of state terrorism by the United States from its history of foreign interventions and policies like low intensity conflict or covert operations.\n\nThe United States intervened in Iraq in the 2003 invasion of Iraq citing concerns for national security and adhering to the evolving Bush Doctrine based on neoconservatism and the democratic peace theory.\nDisputes from ethnic conflict and the question of self-determination and independence can lead to insurgency or military occupation.\nRussia intervened in the 2008 South Ossetia war, but has also voiced support for any of its citizens in places like Ukraine and elsewhere. Multilateral interventions that include territorial governance by foreign institutions also include cases like East Timor and Kosovo, and have been proposed (but were rejected) for the Palestinian territories.\n\nThe United Nations and Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) are examples of international organizations which can be used to both promote or oppose foreign intervention. Scientific criticism point to multi-level governance as a better alternative for public choice theory and decision theory.\n\nPublic peace movements like the anti-war groups promote non-interventionism.\n\nNeoliberalism points to the complex interdependence of foreign relations on economy, but there is criticism of the world economy globalization from the anti-globalization movement. Promoters of global governance and democratic mundialization organize and participate in political activism.\n\nIn Japan, Abenomics is a form of intervention with respect to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's desire to restore the country's former glory in the midst of a globalized economy.\n\nCritics name concerns on media manipulation and censorship like political censorship or denialism. There are accusations that embedded journalism is military manipulation of the media. There are accusations of negationism in public education and education resources. Throughout history propaganda has been used for gaining political capital and political support, like Nazi propaganda, US hegemonic propaganda or communist propaganda. There are also criticisms of monuments and statues supporting various ideologies through political symbolism, such as Nazi architecture.\n\nThere is criticism of promotion of culture of fear and the appeal to fear like the tactic of creating \"fear, uncertainty and doubt\" such as the expressions \"the terrorists have won\" and \"for the children\" in an appeal to emotion.\n\nSee also: List of wars involving the United States, List of wars involving the United Kingdom, List of wars involving France\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Most healthcare providers are uncomfortable telling people that further cure-oriented or life-extending treatment is futile medical care, and patients and families are frequently angry with the provider or feel rejected by the provider when they are given accurate, but negative, information about the patient's prospects. In nearly all cases, \"something\" can be done for the patient, and families often reward and encourage a provider who proposes a string of useless and often directly harmful treatments; as a result, it is easier for providers to substitute worthless and expensive activity than to honestly admit that nothing will extend the patient's life.\n\nInterventionism is related to optimism bias. This is the belief that the patient will beat the odds, no matter how unlikely this might be. Optimism bias encourages patients to undertake treatments that have only tiny chances of success, in the erroneous and irrational belief that they will be part of the tiny minority that is successful, rather than part of the vast majority who are not.\n\nWith terminally ill patients, the attitude of interventionism prevents providers and patients from taking full advantage of palliative care options. The primary focus for palliative care is improving the patient's immediate, daily life through better management of medications, practical assistance, planning for possible complications, and other services. Patients who use palliative care services usually live longer, have fewer disruptive medical crises, incur fewer medical expenses, and have significantly higher quality of life.\n"}

The northern side lies next to bushland, which runs to Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, and the south-western side adjoins Garigal National Park. Native wildlife is common in the area, with bandicoots, blue tongue lizards, possums and many birds being seen. A rare quoll has been found in the suburb in recent years, and rock wallaby are commonly seen on the course at Elanora Country Club. Elanora Heights is home to some of the largest homes in Pittwater and is a popular tourist destination spot.\n\nElanora Heights is a mainly residential suburb, with a few small shops and two golf courses: Elanora Country Club and Monash.

{"id": "1958812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958812", "title": "Heinz Linge", "text": "Heinz Linge\n\nHeinz Linge (23 March 1913 – 9 March 1980) was an SS officer who served as a valet for German dictator Adolf Hitler. Linge was present in the \"Führerbunker\" on 30 April 1945, when Hitler committed suicide.\n\nLinge was born in Bremen, Germany. He was employed as a bricklayer prior to joining the SS in 1933. He served in the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH), Hitler's bodyguard. In 1934 when he was part of No. 1 Guard to Hitler's residence on the Obersalzberg near Berchtesgaden, Linge was selected to serve at the Reich Chancellery. By the end of the war he had obtained the rank of SS-\"Obersturmbannführer\" (lieutenant colonel).\n\nOn 24 January 1935, Linge was chosen to be a valet for Hitler. He was one of three valets at that time. In September 1939, Linge replaced Karl Wilhelm Krause as chief valet for Hitler. Linge worked as a valet in the Reich Chancellery in Berlin, at Hitler's residence near Berchtesgaden, and at Wolfsschanze in Rastenburg. He stated that his daily routine was to wake Hitler each day at 11.00am and provide morning newspapers and messages. Linge would then keep him stocked with writing materials and spectacles for his morning reading session in bed. Hitler would then dress himself to a stopwatch with Linge acting as a \"referee\". He would take a light breakfast of tea, biscuits and an apple and a vegetarian lunch at 2.30pm. Dinner with only a few guests present was at 8.00pm. As Hitler's valet, Linge was also a member of the \"Führerbegleitkommando\" which provided personal security protection for Hitler. By 1944, he was also head of Hitler's personal service staff. Besides accompanying Hitler on all his travels, he was responsible for the accommodations; all the servants, mess orderlies, cooks, caterers and maids were \"subordinate\" to Linge.\n\nLinge was one of many soldiers, servants, secretaries, and officers who moved into the Reich Chancellery and \"Führerbunker\" in Berlin in 1945. There he continued as Hitler's chief valet and protocol officer and was one of those who closely witnessed the last days of Hitler's life during the Battle of Berlin. He was also Hitler's personal military orderly. Linge delivered messages to Hitler and escorted people in to meet with Hitler. In addition, after Hitler's personal physician Theodor Morell left Berlin on 23 April, Linge and Dr. Werner Haase administered to Hitler the prepared medicine which had been left behind.\n\nTwo days before committing suicide on 30 April with Eva Braun, Hitler confided his suicide plan to Linge. He asked Linge to have their bodies wrapped in blankets and taken up to the garden to be cremated. Following his marriage to Eva Braun, Hitler spent the last night of his life lying awake and fully clothed on his bed.\n\nOn 30 April, Hitler had a last midday meal with his secretaries. After the meal, Linge spoke briefly with Eva Braun. He described her as looking pale and of having had little sleep. She thanked him for his service. Hitler then said farewell to each of his servants and subordinates. Thereafter, Hitler retired to his study at 3:15 p.m. There, Linge privately asked Hitler his orders. Hitler said that he was going to shoot himself and Linge knew what he had to do. \"You must never allow my corpse to fall into the hands of the Russians\", Hitler told Linge, \"they would make a spectacle in Moscow out of my body and put it in waxworks\". Further, he had given the order to break-out; Linge was to join one of the groups and try to get to the west. Linge asked for what they should now fight and Hitler replied, \"For the coming man\". Linge then saluted and left. In the 1974 video documentary \"The Two Deaths of Adolf Hitler\", part of \"The World at War\" collection, Linge, along with Hitler's secretary, Traudl Junge, narrates Hitler's very last minutes in the bunker. Linge explains that Hitler and his wife committed suicide in Hitler's private room in the bunker. He tells how he went into Hitler's private study after hearing a sudden bang and found that Hitler and Braun were dead. Hitler had shot himself in the right temple. Braun had taken what Linge concluded must have been cyanide poison. \n\nAfter the suicide of Hitler and Eva Braun, the two bodies were carried up the stairs to ground level and through the bunker's emergency exit to the garden behind the Reich Chancellery, where they were doused with petrol. After the first attempts to ignite the petrol did not work, Linge went back inside the bunker and returned with a thick roll of papers. Martin Bormann lit the papers and threw the torch onto the bodies. As the two corpses caught fire, a small group, including Bormann, Linge, Otto Günsche, Joseph Goebbels, Erich Kempka, Peter Högl, Ewald Lindloff, and Hans Reisser, raised their arms in salute as they stood just inside the bunker doorway.\n\nAt around 16:15, Linge ordered SS-\"Untersturmführer\" Heinz Krüger and SS-\"Oberscharführer\" Werner Schwiedel to roll up the rug in Hitler's study to burn it. The two men removed the blood-stained rug, carried it up the stairs and outside to the Chancellery garden. There the rug was placed on the ground and burned. On and off during the afternoon, the Soviets shelled the area in and around the Reich Chancellery. SS guards brought over additional cans of petrol to further burn the corpses. Linge later noted the fire did not completely destroy the remains, as the corpses were being burned in the open, where the distribution of heat varies. The burning of the corpses lasted from 16:00 to 18:30. The remains were covered up in a shallow bomb crater at around 18:30 by Lindloff and Reisser.\n\nLinge was one of the last to leave the \"Führerbunker\" in the early morning hours of 1 May 1945. He teamed up with SS-\"Obersturmbannführer\" Erich Kempka. Linge was later captured near See-Strasse. On 2 May, the badly burned remains of Hitler, Braun, and two dogs (thought to be Blondi and her offspring Wulf) were discovered in a shell crater by a unit of SMERSH. On 5 May, they secretly removed the remains. According to Ian Kershaw the corpses of Braun and Hitler were fully burned when the Red Army found them, and only a lower jaw with dental work could be identified as Hitler's remains.\n\nSeveral days later, after his identity was revealed, two Soviet officers escorted Linge by train to Moscow where he was thrown into the notorious Lubjanka Prison.\n\nLinge spent ten years in Soviet captivity and was released in 1955. During the imprisonment, Linge and Günsche were interrogated by Soviet NKVD (later superseded by the MVD, separate from the agency of the KGB, formed in 1954) officers about the circumstances of Hitler's death. A dossier was edited by Soviet NKVD officers and presented to Stalin on 30 December 1949. The report was published in book form in 2005 under the title: \"The Hitler Book: The Secret Dossier Prepared for Stalin from the Interrogations of Hitler's Personal Aides\". Linge died in Hamburg in West Germany in 1980. His memoir, \"With Hitler to the End\", was published by Frontline Books-Skyhorse Publishing, Inc. of London in July 2009 with an introduction by historian Roger Moorhouse, author of \"Killing Hitler\".\n\nLinge is portrayed by actor Thomas Limpinsel in Oliver Hirschbiegel's 2004 German film \"Downfall\". In Hans-Jürgen Syberberg's \"\" (1977), he is played by Hellmut Lange. In the 1971 Eastern Bloc co-production \"Liberation V: The Final Assault\", he was portrayed by East German actor Otto Busse.\n\n\n"}

It is a tale of illicit love among the English aristocracy and stars Colin Clive and Katharine Hepburn (in her second screen role). The screenplay by Zoë Akins is an adaptation of the 1932 British novel \"Christopher Strong\" by Gilbert Frankau.\n\nIn London, Monica (Helen Chandler) and her boyfriend Harry attend a scavenger hunt party given by Monica's aunt, Carrie. When nearly everyone wins, Carrie announces a new challenge: women must find a man who has been married over 5 years who is still faithful and men must find a woman over 20 who has never had a love affair. Though Harry has been married over 5 years and Monica is 21 neither fits the other requirement.\n\nMonica departs to find her father, Sir Christopher Strong (Colin Clive), a member of parliament, who she knows has always been faithful to her mother. Harry goes to follow her and has a motorbike crash where he is helped by Lady Cynthia Darrington (Katharine Hepburn), a pilot, who he discovers is over 20 and has never had a love affair. At the party Cynthia and Christopher are introduced and Cynthia and Monica become friends.\n\nDespite Christopher's wife, Lady Elaine (Billie Burke), being suspicious of the friendship between Christopher and Cynthia, Christopher puts her off by insisting that Cynthia is a good influence on Monica.\n\nAfter Monica comes home drunk with Harry one night, Elaine tells him if he is an honourable man he won't see her daughter again. Harry assents and breaks things off with Monica. Upset, Monica begs Christopher to take her to Paris to see Cynthia perform in an aerial show. From there, they invite Cynthia on to their vacation home in Cannes.\n\nAt Cannes Christopher realizes that he is in love with Cynthia. At a party, when his wife has gone home alone, he lets Monica go home with a strange man, Carlos, so that he and Cynthia can be alone. They confess they are in love with one another, but Cynthia decides to break off the affair before anything can begin. She and Christopher vow not see one another.\n\nMonths later, Harry has divorced his wife to marry Monica, but refuses to marry her after discovering that she has been with Carlos. Monica decides to kill herself, but before she can, she goes to tell Cynthia, who tells her that Harry will forgive her. At Monica's behest she also calls Christopher to tell him not to read the suicide note Monica has sent him. He does read it, and in a fit of gratitude goes to see Cynthia.\n\nTo break things off Cynthia decides to join a competition to see who can pilot a plane around the world the fastest, ending in New York. Christopher, who has been sent to New York City for work, meets her there and the two begin an affair. Christopher has her promise not to fly anymore as he thinks it is too dangerous.\n\nMonths later Christopher and Cynthia meet in a small out of the way location, where Cynthia admits that she misses flying. They are seen confessing their love to one another by Monica and Harry, now married, who used to frequent the location during the course of their affair and stopped by for sentimental reasons.\n\nMonica and Harry tell Elaine and Christopher that they are expecting a child, and both are delighted. At the same time Cynthia learns that she will be unable to return to flying because she is pregnant. Discussing the hypothetical with Christopher, Cynthia learns that if he knew she was pregnant he would leave his wife and marry her out of duty.\n\nCynthia decides not to tell Christopher about the pregnancy. She instead decides to break the world record for height achieved in air. Once the record has been broken, Cynthia takes off her oxygen mask causing her to lose consciousness and the plane to nosedive.\n\nOriginally under the working title of \"A Great Desire\", the film was intended as a vehicle for Ann Harding and Leslie Howard. Director Dorothy Arzner and playwright Zoë Akins based the character of Cynthia on British aviator Amy Johnson. In the novel, Cynthia is a racing driver. \"Christopher Strong\" represented the first opportunity for Hepburn to begin developing her screen image as an independent modern woman. This was the only time in her film career that Hepburn played the \"other woman\".\n\nOne of the most notable scenes in the film had Hepburn's character dressed for a costume party in a stunning, form-fitting glittering silver moth costume designed by Walter Plunkett. As part of the impressive production values, the musical score was by noted composer Max Steiner.\n\n\"Christopher Strong\" utilized newsreel footage of takeoffs for the around-the world Dole Air Race and the ticker tape parade celebrating Charles Lindbergh's transatlantic flight. Principal photography took place from December 21, 1932 to February 3, 1933.\n\n\"Christopher Strong\" earned a slim profit and positive film reviews. In his review for \"The New York Times\", film critic Mordaunt Hall described \"Christopher Strong\" as a star vehicle for Katharine Hepburn, \"... who attracted wide attention through her efficient performance in 'A Bill of Divorcement', is the leading light in a pictorial version of Gilbert Frankau's novel, 'Christopher Strong' ... In this her first stellar rôle, Miss Hepburn is far more fortunate than several other stage actresses have been in their initial Hollywood ventures, for aside from giving her excellent opportunities to display her talent, the story is engrossing, and, furthermore, she is supported by a highly capable cast ...\"\n\nIt was nominated for the American Film Institute's 2002 list AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions.\n\nAn image of Hepburn in \"Christopher Strong\" wearing her aviator's flight suit was used for the poster advertising the Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1975.\n\n"}

In the same year he was appointed Kapellmeister of the Kärnthnerthor theatre at Vienna, and two years later in 1825, he became Kapellmeister of the San Carlo theatre at Naples. It was here he gave piano lessons to the young prodigy Theodor Döhler.\n\nIn Naples his first opera, \"Giacinta ed Ernesto\", premiered in 1827, and another, written for his native city, \"I Portoghesi in Goa\", was given there in 1830; neither of these was a great success, and in 1834 he went to Paris, leaving it in 1835 at the suggestion of Maria Malibran for London, where he spent the remainder of his life. In 1836 he was given the conductorship of an operatic enterprise at the Lyceum Theatre, and brought out a short opera, \"Un anno ed un giorno\", previously given in Naples.\n\nIn 1838 he became conductor of the English opera at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane during the period of Michael William Balfe's great popularity; his own operas produced there were \"The Gipsy's Warning\" (1838), \"The Brides of Venice\" (1844), and \"The Crusaders\" (1846). In 1848 he conducted Felix Mendelssohn's \"Elijah\" at Exeter Hall, for the first appearance of Jenny Lind in oratorio, and in 1850 he was the accompanist and conductor on Lind's tour of America.\n\nOn his return in 1852 he became musical conductor under James Henry Mapleson's management at Her Majesty's Theatre (and afterwards at Drury Lane), and in the same year conductor of the Harmonic Union. Amongst his minor works is an \"Andantino for Concertina and Fortepiano\" written in 1858. Benedict wrote recitatives for the production of an Italian-language version of Weber's \"Oberon\" in 1860 (it was then the tradition in England to perform German operas in Italian). In the same year his cantata \"Undine\" was produced at the Norwich Festival, in which Clara Novello appeared in public for the last time.\n\nHis best-known opera, \"The Lily of Killarney\", written on the subject of Dion Boucicault's play \"The Colleen Bawn\" to a libretto by John Oxenford, was produced at Covent Garden in 1862. His operetta \"The Bride of Song\" was brought out there in 1864.\n\nBenedict wrote a march for the wedding of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales and Alexandra of Denmark in 1863. \"St Cecilia\", an oratorio, was performed at the Norwich Festival in 1868; \"St Peter\" at the Birmingham Festival of 1870; \"Graziella\", a cantata, was given at the Birmingham Festival of 1882, and in August 1883 was produced in operatic form at the Crystal Palace. Here also a symphony by him was given in 1873. In the autumn of 1875, Benedict corresponded with W. S. Gilbert about collaborating on a comic opera with him, but Gilbert had too many projects and the idea was dropped.\nBenedict conducted every Norwich Festival from 1845 to 1878 inclusive, and the Liverpool Philharmonic Society's concerts from late 1875 to 1880. He was the regular accompanist at the Monday Popular Concerts in London from their start, and with few exceptions acted as conductor of these concerts.\n\nHe contributed an interesting life of Weber to the series of biographies of \"Great Musicians\". In 1871 he was knighted, and in 1874 was made knight commander of the orders of Franz Joseph I of Austria and Frederick I of Württemberg.

Gawler's father was killed in battle in Mysore, India in December 1804. The Gawler family historically came from Devon. George Gawler was educated by a tutor, then at a school in Cold Bath, Islington. Two years were then spent at the Royal Military College, Great Marlow, where he was a diligent and clever student.\nIn October 1810, Gawler obtained a commission as an ensign in the 52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot and in January 1812 went to the Peninsular War. He was a member of a storming party at Badajoz, and was wounded and saved from death by a soldier who lost his own life. He was in Spain until 1814, taking part in the advance on Madrid. The regiment returned to England and Gawler, now a lieutenant, fought at the Battle of Waterloo. He remained in France with the army of occupation until 1818, and in 1820 married Maria Cox of Friar Gate, Derby who was the niece of Samuel Richardson. Gawler's new sister-in-law, Mary Ann, married William Leeke, a fellow officer from the 52nd. Gawler and his wife were sincerely religious and when the 52nd was sent to New Brunswick in 1823 they did much social and religious work. Gawler returned to England in 1826 and from 1830 to 1832 was engaged in recruiting. He reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel in 1834 and in 1837 received the Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order (KH), third class.\nIn 1838 Gawler was appointed Governor of South Australia in succession to Captain John Hindmarsh, who had been recalled, as well as being appointed to the role of Resident Commissioner, taking over from the first incumbent, James Hurtle Fisher. Gawler and his wife and children arrived on the \"Pestonjee Bomanjee\" on 12 October 1838, after a four-month journey via Tenerife and Rio de Janeiro. Gawler found the colony had almost no public finances, underpaid officials and 4000 immigrants living in makeshift accommodation. He was allowed a maximum of £12,000 expenditure a year, with an additional £5,000 credit for emergencies.\n\nHis first goal was to address delays over rural settlement and primary production. He persuaded Charles Sturt to come from New South Wales to work as surveyor-general, personally overseeing the surveys in the meantime, as Colonel William Light had resigned due to ailing health and the demands placed on him with insufficient staff. Gawler promptly increased and reorganised the fledgling police force, promoting its commander Henry Inman. Gawler appointed more colonial officials, took part in exploration, and improved the facilities at Port Adelaide during his tenure as governor. The first permanent Government House was built, which is now the East Wing of the present building.\n\nThe South Australian Company's greatest source of revenue, the sale of land, had largely dried up due to surveying delays in 1838. The rapid increase in population in 1839 and 1840 due to immigration greatly added to the unemployment problem. Droughts in other Australian colonies in 1840, before South Australia was self-sufficient in food, drove up the cost of living rapidly. Gawler increased public expenditure to stave off collapse, which resulted in bankruptcy and changes to the way the colony was run. Over £200,000 had been spent and the land fund in London had been exhausted. A £155,000 loan was approved by the British Parliament (later made a gift) and Captain George Grey was sent to replace Gawler, after Grey promised to \"maintain the strictest economy\". In his time in office Governor Grey helped make South Australia self-sufficient in terms of agriculture and restored public confidence, though the real salvation of the colony may have been the discovery of copper at Burra in 1845.\n\nAfter retirement as governor in 1841, Gawler devoted his time to religious and charitable works.\n\nIn 1845, Gawler wrote a memorandum, \"The Tranquillization of Syria and the East\", in which he suggested that Jews be allowed to establish Jewish agricultural settlements in Palestine as compensation for their suffering under Turkish rule. \"The Emancipation of the Jews\" followed in 1847, and in 1849 he toured Palestine with Moses Montefiore. In a further work, \"Syria and its Near Prospects\", (1853) he made four arguments for the proposition that Jewish settlement was already under way.\n\nIn 1850 Gawler retired from the army. In the same year, he wrote \"Present State of Moral Principle in the Supreme Government of the British Colonial Empire\", in which he petitioned the Queen seeking redress for the injustices done to him by successive secretaries of state. Accusing George Grey of dishonesty, he claimed that it had been through his efforts that South Australia was \"the only cheap and brilliantly successful new colony in modern history\".\nGawler spent his last years at Southsea, where he died of pneumonia on 7 May 1869. He was buried at Portsmouth.\n\nGawler's work was long misjudged, largely because his successor Grey, in his dispatches, made the worst of his predecessor's acts, without suggesting the difficulties under which he had worked. Gawler was a gallant and energetic officer who, when he found the settlers faced with disaster, saw at once what it was necessary to do, and saved the colony. Mills however, accepts the view that Gawler had been guilty of carelessness and extravagance and cannot be wholly acquitted of blame, though the extraordinary difficulties with which he was faced are acknowledged. Charles Sturt and other men at the time generally agreed that his administration had greatly benefited the settlement, and the select committee on South Australia reported that the critics of his expenditure were \"unable to point out any specific item by which it could have been considerably reduced without great public inconvenience\". Much of Gawler's expenditure was on works of both immediate and long-lasting benefit to the Colony and the State, such as the Great Eastern Road. Many modern historians put him among the founders of South Australia.\n\nThe town of Gawler was named after him, as well as the adjoining river.\n\nThe Gawler Ranges at the north end of Eyre Peninsula are also named after him by the explorer Edward John Eyre in 1839.\n\nGawler's reputation was somewhat tarnished by his involvement in the Maria massacre in 1852.\n\nDerby's Town and County Museum in the 1830s included Gawler in its list of principal benefactors. Gawler had contributed a collection of minerals and exotic stuffed birds which included an albatross from his time as governor. Also, Gawler's gardener in Australia, Joseph Whittaker, contributed hundreds of pressed flowers and plants to Derby Museum and to Kew Gardens.\n\nA portrait of him hangs in Parliament House, Adelaide, and another in the City Council Chamber, Adelaide.\n\nGawler's eldest surviving son, Henry (1827-1894), returned to South Australia in 1858. He was a solicitor in the South Australian Land Titles Office from 1858 to 1884.\n\nOne of his grandsons, Douglas Gawler, was a member of parliament in Western Australia.\n\n"}

{"id": "1958834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958834", "title": "Danilo Stojković", "text": "Danilo Stojković\n\nDanilo Stojković (; 11 August 1934 – 16 March 2002), commonly nicknamed Bata (Бата), was a Serbian theatre, television and film actor. Stojković's numerous comedic portrayals of the \"small man fighting the system\" made him popular with Serbian and ex-Yugoslav audiences, most of them coming in collaborations with either director Slobodan Šijan or scriptwriter Dušan Kovačević, or both.\n\nBelgrade-born and bred Stojković, a well-known theatre actor by the mid-1960s, started his film career with the 1964 feature \"Izdajnik\" (lit. \"The Traitor\"). A string of TV and minor film roles ensued, with the most important ones coming in guise of being a father figure to the main protagonist – \"Čuvar plaže u zimskom periodu\" (\"Beach Guard in Winter\", 1976), \"Pas koji je voleo vozove\" (\"The Dog Who Loved Trains\", 1977) being the most recognizable ones – as well as the part in critically well-received \"Majstor i Margarita\" (\"Il Maestro e Margherita\"), 1972.\n\nHe also fulfilled the fatherly role in an immensely popular TV show \"Grlom u jagode\". The show originally aired in 1975 and kept finding its audience through numerous reruns in the 1980s and the 1990s. Most notably, he almost stole the show as the minor antagonist in Goran Marković's urban classic \"Nacionalna klasa do 750 cm³\" (\"National Class Category Up to 750 ccm\"), 1979.\n\nStojković worked with the director Slobodan Šijan, who was in turn most successful when working with Dušan Kovačević scripts. Kovačević, a talented playwright with a special gift for biting satire, had a knack for writing characters which Stojković could perfectly translate to screen. The combination of those three creative talents yielded some of Yugoslavia's most memorable cinematic efforts to date.\n\nŠijan, who previously worked with Stojković on a several TV productions, made his big screen debut with \"Ko to tamo peva\" (\"Who's Singing Over There?\", 1980), a farcical comedy set at the beginning of World War II in then Yugoslavia. In a strong cast ensemble, Stojković distinguished himself with role of a Germanophile bus passenger on the way to Beograd in the eve of 6 April 1941 – the day Belgrade was bombed by the Axis Powers marking Yugoslavia's entry into the war. \n\n\"Ko to tamo peva\" was released to great critical and commercial success, and has won two awards at the Montreal World Film Festival in Canada. The success of \"Ko to tamo peva\" opened new doors for Stojković, who then established his film star status with a string of critically acclaimed roles. He appeared in Goran Paskaljević's dark comedy about rehab from alcoholism, \"Poseban tretman\" (\"Special Treatment\"), 1980.\n\nHe reunited with Šijan for another high-water mark of Serbian film, the black comedy \"Maratonci trče počasni krug\" (\"Marathon Family\"). The film, a humorous piece about a family whose undertaking business is being threatened by the local mobster was another smash success for Šijan and Stojković, and has cult status. He also voiced Stromboli in the Serbian-language version of \"Pinocchio\".\n\nAfter a couple minor roles, from which his turn as the school principal in comedy \"Idemo dalje\" (lit. \"Moving On\", 1982) deserved some mention, Stojković delivered a trio of performances which would ultimately cement his place in the Yugoslavian acting hall of fame. Oddly enough, all three of those roles would involve him portraying a character closely related to the communist ideals – or better said, satirizing a stereotype of \"party men\" or \"marxist revolutionaries\".\n\nFirst was his portrait of a homeless wannabe revolutionary Babi Pupuška, in Šijan's \"Kako sam sistematski uništen od idiota\" (\"How I Got Systematically Destroyed by an Idiot\", (1983), a story about a man who embarks on a soul-searching journey after hearing the, for him at least, shattering news of Che Guevara's demise. Building momentum from this film onward, Stojković fused his father figure persona he honed in the 1970s with the Marxist nut of Babi Pupuška, and delivered another bravura performance in Goran Paskaljević's elegiac \"Varljivo leto '68\" (\"The Elusive Summer of '68\", 1984). Stojković's character of a hardline Marxist father, who cannot bear to witness the events of the 1968 unfold before his very own eyes, struck a chord with audiences.\n\nAgain uniting his talents with those of Dušan Kovačević, Stojković delivered his ultimate film performance – that of the staunch Stalinist and a full-time paranoid in \"Balkanski špijun\" (\"Balkan Spy\", 1984), which was jointly directed by Božidar Nikolić and Kovačević himself. With Kovačević at his sharpest, Stojković made the role of ex-political prisoner Ilija Čvorović completely his own.\n\nHis role in \"Balkanski špijun\" was one of the last major theatrical roles for Stojković. After his major successes of the early 1980s, Stojković concentrated mainly on television and theatre, with an odd supporting role here and there. He was effective in both \"Vreme čuda\" (lit. \"Time of the Miracles\", 1989) and \"Sabirni centar\" (\"The Collective Center\"), and had a memorable cameo in \"Balkan Express 2\" (1989). His most famous theatrical role was that of Luka Laban, in another Kovačević play, \"Profesionalac\" (lit. \"The Professional\"). He played the role until a few days before his death. In an interview in 2007 his wife told that she drove him from the hospital to his last plays and returned him to the hospital bed after the play.\n\nIn the 1990s, Stojković cameoed in \"Crni bombarder\" (\"The Black Bomber\", 1992), and had minor roles in movies such as Emir Kusturica's \"Underground\" (1995) and Darko Bajić's \"Balkanska pravila\" (\"The Rules of Balkan\", 1997).\n\nIronically enough, one of his final theatrical roles was one of an orthodox priest – a character who Babi Pupuška and Ilija Čvorović would probably despise – in Lazar Ristovski's 1999 effort \"Belo odelo\" (\"The White Suit\"). After that, he appeared in an omnibus feature called \"Proputovanje\" (\"Traveling\", 1999) and starred in a TV adaptation of the August Strindberg's play \"The Father\" for Radio-televizija Srbije – RTS (\"Otac\", 2001). \n\nStojković died in Belgrade on 16 March 2002, after a lengthy bout with lung cancer.\n\nThroughout his lifetime, Stojković was the recipient of the Serbian Lifetime Achievement Award for both theatrical (\"Dobričin prsten\", 1990) and cinematic (\"Pavle Vujisić\", 1998) efforts. He remains as popular in death as he was in life, as his characters have entertained numerous generations of Serbo-Croatian speakers.\n"}

AUSA organises student events, publicises student issues, administers student facilities, and assists affiliated student clubs and societies. It also produces \"Craccum\" magazine and bFM radio station. \n\nThe constitution of the AUSA centres the organisation around student advocacy and the provision of welfare services. Today AUSA has 27,000 members out of 42,000 equivalent full-time students enrolled at the University of Auckland.\n\nAUSA has over 100 affiliated clubs, the student bar Shadows, University Book Shop, Student Job Search, market days and events such as Orientation, Summer Shakespeare, End of Daze, Capping week, Womensfest, Cultural Mosaic, Blues Awards and Ecofest.\n\nThe AUSA Executive consists of Officers and Portfolios.\n\n\n\nAUSA membership is free to all current students of the University of Auckland.\n\nAs required by legislation, the University Council conducted a student referendum in 1999 on whether membership in AUSA should be voluntary or compulsory. The majority of students supported voluntary membership and this was enacted. Referendums on the same issue were held in 2001 and 2003, and in each case, the majority of students voted for voluntary association. (The request for a referendum is in the form of a petition to the University Council, which any student may call, and thus must be conducted, provided no two referendums are less than two years apart.)\n\nDetractors of voluntary student membership (VSM) say that AUSA suffers drastically from it, and that VSM undermines AUSA's ability to advocate on behalf of students and provide welfare services. They also say that in controlling the flow of money, the University dictates the terms to some extent of its operations through various agreements. As early as the mid-nineties, a number of incidents increased AUSA's credibility and alienated a lot of members who were previously disinterested in student politics, and were an undeniable factor in the 1999 referendum. Contentious issues like allocation of funds was the focus of many debates at the Quad.\n\nProponents of VSM, on the other hand, claim VSM means freedom of choice for students. They cite the United Nations declaration of freedom of association. They also paint AUSA executives under compulsory unionism as being wasteful, and believe that under voluntary AUSA executives are forced to be more accountable to members. They claim that the level of intervention is very limited (for example, the conditions are only that AUSA must run orientation and the like).\n\n\"Craccum\" is the weekly magazine produced by the AUSA. The name originated from the scrambled acronym of \"Auckland University College Men's Common Room Circular\". The publication has frequently found itself in legal difficulties due to its deliberate attempts to be controversial. These attempts have included an issue containing methods to create a bomb, and an issue discussing ways to commit suicide.\n\nA publicity stunt in 2005 saw \"Craccum\" sell its cover - which was bought by \"Salient\", the student magazine of Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association, with the funds from Victoria University of Wellington's marketing fund. The joke turned out to be on them, as the theme of that issue of \"Craccum\" was corporate sellouts. \"Craccum\" made the point that commercialism would erode the students' voice.\n\n95bFM (or simply bFM) is a typical student radio station that plays alternative music. Like other student broadcasters, it supports local artists well before they become mainstream.\n\nOriginally started as Radio Bosom, a capping stunt, bFM has gone a long way. Today, with voluntary student union membership, bFM is pushed to make a profit for the Association, and exists more as a corporate entity than a student radio station.\n\n"}

In 2002, fish collectors working in western Thailand began to expand their search into Myanmar (Burma) area from the Three Pagodas Pass Thai-Myanmar border to look for new fish for the aquarium trade. This is one of several species discovered and explains the origin of the fish's common name: Burmese Border Loach. Its specific epithet honors Katsuma Kubota of an aquarium export company in Thailand who first purchased the catch and sent them out for identification.\n\nThe fish, a bottom feeder, is found in the Salween River system which is mostly in Myanmar. It was first discovered in Ataran River (known in Thailand as Kasat River), a tributary of Salween River. A population in Thailand was discovered in early 2006 in another tributary of Salween River, Suriya River in Thungyai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary. It grows as large as 15 cm in length, but most tend to be smaller at around 10 cm. It has gold, black, and grey colors arranged in a pattern that varies greatly depending on the age of the fish. Juvenile fish at about 2.5 cm are very similar to \"Botia histrionica\". It has yellow body with only black vertical bands. Typically around this size grey dots on the black bands together with a middle horizontal bar joining the bands begin to appear. At about 5 cm, the top and bottom part of the vertical bands start to merge, producing a pattern of big yellow ovals along the body. More grey dots continue to appear as fish grows.\n\nThis fish, like most other loach species, should be kept in groups when placed in an aquarium. Suitable water parameters are 25 - 30 °C, pH 6.5 to 6.9, dGH 0 to 8.0. Lots of hiding places should also be provided. Newly purchased, it is a good idea to treat them for internal parasites, a very common problem for wild-caught bottom feeder fishes.\n\n\"Botia kubotai\" is omnivorous and will accept most food types offered to freshwater fish including snails, small shrimp, sinking pellets, blood worms, and black worms.\n\n\n"}

Manuela received the Order of the Sun (\"\"Caballeresa del Sol\"\" or 'Dame of the Sun'), honoring her services in the revolution.\n\nSáenz married a wealthy English merchant in 1817 and became a socialite in Lima, Peru. This provided the setting for involvement in political and military affairs, and she became active in support of revolutionary efforts. Leaving her husband in 1822, she soon began an eight-year collaboration and intimate relationship with Simón Bolívar that lasted until his death in 1830. After she prevented an 1828 assassination attempt against him and facilitated his escape, Bolívar began to call her \"\"Libertadora del libertador\"\" (\"liberator of the liberator\"). Manuela's role within the revolution after her death generally was overlooked until the late twentieth century, presently she is recognized as a feminist symbol of the 19th century wars of independence.\n\nManuela was born in Quito, the illegitimate child of Maria Joaquina Aizpuru from Ecuador and the married Spanish nobleman Simón Sáenz Vergara (or Sáenz y Verega). Her mother was abandoned by her modest family as a result of the pregnancy and young \"Manuelita\" went to school at the Convent of Santa Catalina where she learned to read and write. She was forced to leave the convent at the age of seventeen, when she was discovered to have been seduced by Army Officer Fausto D'Elhuyar, the son of Fausto Elhuyar and nephew of Juan José Elhuyar, who were the co-discoverers of tungsten.\n\nFor several years, Manuela lived with her father, who in 1817 arranged for her marriage to a wealthy English merchant, James Thorne, who was twice her age. The couple moved to Lima, Peru, in 1819 where she lived as an aristocrat and held social gatherings in her home where guests included political leaders and military officers. These guests shared military secrets about the ongoing revolution with her, and, in 1819, when Simón Bolívar took part in the successful liberation of New Granada, Manuela Sáenz became an active member in the conspiracy against the viceroy of Perú, José de la Serna e Hinojosa during 1820.\n\nIn 1822, Sáenz left her husband and traveled to Quito, where she met Simón Bolívar. She exchanged love letters with him, and visited him while he moved from one country to another. Manuela supported the revolutionary cause by gathering information, distributing leaflets, and protesting for women's rights. As one of the most prominent female figures of the wars for independence, Manuela received the Order of the Sun (\"\"Caballeresa del Sol\"\" or 'Dame of the Sun'), honoring her services in the revolution. During the first months of 1825 and from February to September 1826, she lived with Bolívar near Lima, but as the war continued, Bolívar was forced to leave. Manuela later followed him to Bogotá. On September 25, 1828, mutinous officers attempted to assassinate Bolívar, but with Manuela's help he was able to escape, which made him later call her \"\"Libertadora del Libertador\"\".\n\nBolívar left Bogotá in 1830 and died in Santa Marta from tuberculosis while he was in transit, leaving the country to exile. He had made no provision for Manuela. Francisco de Paula Santander, who returned to power after Bolívar's death then exiled Manuela. She went to Jamaica for the early years of her exile.\n\nWhen she attempted to return to Ecuador in 1835, the Ecuadorian president, Vicente Rocafuerte, revoked her passport. She then took refuge in northern Peru, living in the small coastal town of Paita. For the next twenty-five years, a destitute outcast, Manuela sold tobacco and translated letters for North American whale hunters who wrote to their lovers in Latin America. While there, she met the American author Herman Melville, and the revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi.\n\nIn 1847, her husband was murdered in Pativilca and she was denied her 8,000 pesos inheritance. Disabled after the stairs in her home collapsed, Manuela died in Paita, on November 23, 1856, during a diphtheria epidemic. Her body was buried in a communal, mass grave and her belongings were burned. The items that did survive, personal letters and artifacts, contributed later to the legacy of both her and Simon Bolívar.\n\nOn his deathbed, Bolívar had asked his aide-de-camp, General Daniel F. O'Leary to burn the remaining, extensive archive of his writings, letters, and speeches. O'Leary disobeyed the order and his writings survived, providing historians with a vast wealth of information about Bolívar's liberal philosophy and thought, as well as details of his personal life, such as his longstanding love affair with Manuela Sáenz. Shortly before her own death in 1856, Sáenz augmented this collection by giving O'Leary her own letters from Bolívar.\n\nOn July 5, 2010, Manuela Sáenz was given a full state burial in Venezuela. Because she had been buried in a mass grave, no official remains of her existed for the state burial; instead, \"symbolic remains\", composed of some soil from the mass grave into which she was buried during the epidemic, were transported through Peru, Ecuador and Colombia to Venezuela. Those remains were laid in the National Pantheon of Venezuela where those of Bolívar are also memorialized.\n\nAfter the revolution, Manuela effectively faded from literature. Between 1860 and 1940 only three Ecuadorian writers wrote about her and her participation within the revolution, and these writings largely portrayed her as either exclusively the lover of Simón Bolívar or as incapable and wrongfully participating within the political sphere. These portrayals also assured her femininity as a mainstay of her characterization. However, the 1940s created a significant shift in how she was viewed and characterized. Literature like \"Papeles De Manuela Saenz\", 1945, by Vicente Lecuna, which was a compilation of documents regarding the life of Bolívar, effectively disproved popular stereotypes about Manuela. Ideas about her being sexually deviant, hyper feminine and incapable were replaced by more favorable portrayals as the 20th century progressed.\n\nThe later 20th century generated shifts in her portrayals that were consistent with ideological shifts within Latin America, like the increase of feminism of the 1980s and nationalism of the 1960s – 1970s. Portrayals within the fictional \"The General in His Labyrinth\" by Gabriel García Márquez and the nonfictional Alfonso Rumazo's \"Manuela Saenz La Libertadora del Libertador\" contributed to her effective humanization within popular culture and helped politicize her image. Alfonso Rumazo’s novel was especially poignant for its ideas of Pan-American Nationalism that were represented through Manuela's participation within the wars of independence. Manuela became increasingly popular with radical Latin American feminist groups subsequently, her image was commonly used as a rallying point for Indo-Latina causes of the 1980s. The popular image of Manuela riding horseback in men's clothing, popularized by her portrayal in \"The General in His Labyrinth\", was re-enacted by female demonstrators in Ecuador in 1998.\n\nOn May 25, 2007 the Ecuadorian government symbolically gave Saenz the rank of General.\n\nThe Museo Manuela Sáenz is a museum in Old Town, Quito, that contains personal effects from both Sáenz and Bolívar to \"[safeguard] the memories of Manuela Saenz, Quito's illustrious daughter\". Located at Junin 709 y Montufar, Centro Histórico, Quito. Entrance to the museum is free with the purchase of one of the books about Manuela's life. Personal effects within the museum include letters, stamps, and paintings.\n\n\n“Bolívar\", Netflix Original Series (2019) 60 episodes.\n\nCited sources\n"}

Elsa the Lioness is buried in this park and part of Joy's ashes were scattered on her gravesite.\n\nBetween the years 2000 and 2005, the Kenya Wildlife Service, helped by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), restored Meru National Park from near ruin to one of the most promising tourist destinations in Eastern Africa, solving the parks poaching problem. IFAW donated $1.25 million to this major restoration project, and with this money aided in improving the basic infrastructure and provided essential equipment and vehicles for law enforcement activities.\n\nSince 2005, the protected area is considered part of a Lion Conservation Unit.\n\nAside from the scenery and wildlife, tourist attractions include the once home of George and Joy Adamson, Adamson's Falls, the burial sites of Joy Adamson and Elsa the Lioness, views of Mount Kenya, and the Tana River.\n\n"}

Wars and internal disputes have separated the kingdom of Esviore and now, the area of South Esviore where the game takes place is no longer under the control of King Slaith. Instead, each separate city-state of South Esviore runs their own affairs, trading with one another but remaining mostly separate.\n\nThe situation with Regallzine is also tied with the fate of Avenberry, a legendary city of alchemists that existed many hundreds of years before the game's beginning. No one knows exactly what happened, but it is said that Avenberry fell because of the misuse of the alchemy that ran their lives. Many alchemists and treasure hunters have come to Avenberry to try to unlock its secrets since that time, and the city of Kavoc was built for that purpose. However, none have been able to get past the gate that guards the citadel, and Avenberry's secrets have so far been preserved.\n\nAlchemists today are few and far between, most basing their research on the studies of Iris, an alchemist who lived before the fall of Avenberry. They travel the world in search of new alchemaic artifacts for synthesis, ruins of the past, and Mana. The mana are a race of beings that allow alchemists to use their power. They augment the power of the elements which Alchemists extract from objects in the world and use them to create new and powerful magical items. Mana have feelings, emotions, and personalities just as people do, and many become good friends with their alchemist, although some people do forget about this fact.\n\nThe protagonist of the game, Klein Kiesling, is one of these wandering alchemists. His adventure begins when he stumbles across a monster in a forest, is rescued by a girl, and gets wound up in her fate and eventually, the fate of the world.\n\n\"Eternal Mana\" contains six playable characters. Three characters can be in a battle party, with the player free to switch the others in and out at any time.\n\nThe main driving force behind the alchemy of the game are the Mana Spirits. Some Mana have the power to transform into new, even more powerful Mana forms. Below is a list of each Mana, and their element:\n\nThe battle system in Atelier Iris is turn-based. Combat is tactical in that the party members can have their positions arranged in their half of the playing field before battle, and can be knocked back by some attacks. Each participant in the battle chooses an action from the ring of commands available. All characters can use actions such as Attack, Skill and Items but Klein, as the only alchemist of the party, can use Mana Items and Mana Synthesis (which duplicates the effects of Mana Items, at the expense of MP.) Once enemies are defeated the party gains experience, gold and possibly items. Every time a character levels up, he gains 3 points to be added to the skills of the player's choice. Characters equipped with Mana spirits gain bonus skill points.\n\nAs an alchemy-based game, \"Atelier Iris\" features several forms of item synthesis:\n\n\"Atelier Iris\" is notable for having several in-game actions that help in exploring the game's world, including unusual ones such as flying, changing into a rabbit, using a Mana as a footstool, or healing the whole party.

{"id": "1958862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958862", "title": "Vanguard (microkernel)", "text": "Vanguard (microkernel)\n\nVanguard is a discontinued experimental microkernel developed at Apple Computer's research group (ATG) in the early 1990s. Based on the V-System, Vanguard introduced standardized object identifiers and a unique \"message chaining\" system for improved performance. Vanguard was not used in any of Apple's commercial products, and development ended in 1993 when Ross Finlayson - the project's principal investigator - left Apple.\n\nVanguard was generally very similar to the V-System, but added support for true object oriented programming of the operating system. This meant that kernel and server interfaces were exported as objects, which could be \"inherited\" and extended in new code. This change has no real effect on the system itself, it is primarily a change in the source code that makes programming easier.\n\nFor instance, Vanguard had an I/O class which was supported by a number of different servers, networking and file servers for instance, which new applications could interact with by importing the I/O interface and calling methods. This also made writing new servers much easier, both because they had a standard to program to, as well as being able to share code more easily.\n\nA key concept to almost all microkernels is breaking down a single large kernel into a set of communicating \"servers\". Instead of having a single large program in control of the entire hardware side of the computer system, these sorts of duties are handed out to smaller programs that are given rights to control different parts of the machine. For instance, a particular server might be given control of the networking hardware, while another has the task of managing the hard drives. Another server would handle the file system, calling both of these lower-level servers. User applications ask for services by sending \"messages\" to these servers, using some form of inter-process communications (IPC), as opposed to asking the kernel to do this work via a \"syscall\" or \"trap\".\n\nUnder V the IPC system appears to be conceptually modeled on remote procedure calls (RPC) from the client application's perspective. The client application imported an interface definition file containing information about the calls supported by the kernel, or other applications, and then used this definition to package up requests. When called, the kernel would immediately take over, examine the results, and pass the information off to the right handler, potentially within the kernel itself. Any results were then handed back through the kernel to the client.\n\nIn general terms, the operation of the system as it appears to the client application is very similar to working with a normal monolithic kernel. Although the results passed back might come from a third party handler, this was essentially invisible to the client. Servers handling these requests operated in a similar fashion to the clients, opening connections with the kernel to pass data. However, servers generally spawned new threads as required to handle longer-lasting requests. When these were handled and the responses posted, the thread could be de-allocated and the servers could go into a \"receive mode\" awaiting further requests.\n\nIn contrast, most microkernel systems are based on a model of asynchronous communications, as opposed to synchronous procedure calls. The canonical microkernel system, Mach, modeled messages as I/O, which has several important side-effects. Primary among these is that the normal task schedulers under Unix-like systems will normally block a client that is waiting on an I/O request, so in this way the actions of pausing and restarting applications waiting on messages was already built into the underlying system. The downside to this approach is that the scheduler is fairly \"heavyweight\", and calling it was a serious performance bottleneck and led to extensive development efforts to improve its performance. Under the V-System model the message passing overhead is reduced because the process scheduler does not have to be consulted, there is no question as to who should next be run – it's the server being called. The downside to the V approach is that it requires more work on the server side if the response may take some time to process.\n\nOne major addition to the IPC system under Vanguard, as opposed to V, was the concept of \"message chains\", allowing a single message to be sent between several interacting servers in a single round-trip. In theory, chaining could improve the performance of common multi-step operations.\n\nConsider the case where a client application wishes to read a file. Normally this would require one message to the kernel to find the file server, then three additional messages to the file server itself - one to resolve the file name into an object id, another to open that id, then finally another to read the file. Using Vanguard's chaining, a single message could be constructed by the client that contained all of these requests. The message would be sent to the kernel, and then passed off to the file server who would handle all three requests before finally returning data.\n\nMuch of the performance problem normally associated with microkernel systems are due to the context switches as messages are passed back and forth between applications. In the example above running on a V system, there would have to be a total of eight context switches; two for each request as the client switched to and from the kernel. In Vanguard using a chain would reduce this to only three switches; one out of the client into the kernel, another from the kernel to the file server, and finally from the server back to the client. In some cases the overhead of a context switch is greater than the time it takes to actually run the request, so Vanguard's chaining mechanism could result in real-world performance improvements.\n\nV had also introduced a simple distributed \"name service\". The name service stored \"well known\" character names representing various objects in a distributed V system, for instance \"2nd floor laser printer\". Applications could ask the name server for objects by name, and would be handed back an identifier that would allow them to interact with that object. The name service was not itself a separate server, and was managed by code in the kernel itself. Contrast this with the full-blown \"name server\" under the Spring operating system, which not only knew about objects inside the system, but was also used by other servers on the system to translate their private names – file names and IP addresses for instance.\n\nUnder the V-System, objects in servers were referred to via an \"ad hoc\" private key of some sort, say a 32-bit integer. Clients would pass these keys into the servers in order to maintain a conversation about a specific task. For instance, an application might ask the kernel for the \"file system\" and be handed a 32-bit key representing a program id, and then use that key to send a message to the file system asking it to open the file \"my addresses\", which would result in a 64-bit key being handed back. The keys in this example are proprietary to the servers, there was no common key format being used across the system.\n\nThis sort of name resolving was so common under V that the authors decided to make these keys first-class citizens under Vanguard. Instead of using whatever object ID's the servers just happened to use, under Vanguard all servers were expected to understand and return a globally unique 128-bit key, the first 64-bits containing a server identifier, the second identifying an object in that server. The server id was maintained in the kernel, allowing it to hand off the message over the network if the server being referenced was on a remote machine. To the client this was invisible. It is not clear if the id's were handed out randomly to avoid \"guessing\" by ill-intentioned software.\n\n"}

Her acclaimed soprano and pure style made her one of the greatest vocalists, alike in opera, oratorio and on the concert stage, from 1833 onwards. In 1843 she married Count Gigliucci, and retired in 1861. Charles Lamb wrote a poem (\"To Clara N.\") in her praise.\n\nShe was born in Oxford Street, London, on 10 June 1818, the fourth daughter of Vincent Novello and Mary Sabilla Hehl. Mary Victoria Cowden Clarke was her eldest sister. Clara was taken in childhood to York, and was placed under Miss Hill, the leading singer, and John Robinson, organist of the Roman Catholic chapel there. Her talents were at once displayed; and on Easter Sunday, when Miss Hill was suddenly indisposed, Clara offered to sing all her solos from memory, and succeeded. In 1829, she became a pupil of the Institution royale de musique classique et religieuse in Paris. She always retained the strongest appreciation of her training there; Palestrina's music was much sung, and Clara ascribed her perfect sostenuto to having sung in his motets, and being obliged to hold the suspensions. \nThe academy declined after the revolution of 1830, and Clara, who had had unpleasant experiences of the fighting, returned to England. \n\nOn 22 October 1832, aged 14, she made her first public appearance, in a concert at Windsor, with full success; and in December she took the soprano part in Beethoven's \"Missa Solennis\". She was soon among the first singers of the day, being engaged at the whole series of Ancient Concerts, at the Philharmonic Concerts, and the Three Choirs Festival. She sang in a sestet, Grisi leading, at the Handel commemoration in June 1834; Lord Mount-Edgcumbe describes her as Her father's friend, Charles Lamb, though quite unmusical, wrote the lines 'To Clara N.' published in the \"Athenæum,\" 26 July 1834. \n\nShe was left without a rival on the retirement of Catherine Stephens, Countess of Essex, in 1835, and took the leading soprano part at all important English concerts. Handel's music was particularly adapted to her style. At the Manchester Festival in September 1836, she had much useful advice from the dying Maria Malibran. \n\nIn 1837, Felix Mendelssohn invited her to the Gewandhaus Concerts, Leipzig, where she appeared on 2 November 1837, and several times later. She was well received, and succeeded in making German audiences appreciate Handel's solos. Schumann declared that nothing for years past had given him so much pleasure as Miss Novello's voice, 'every note sharply defined as on the keyboard.' Mendelssohn wrote that Clara Novello and Mrs. Shaw (her successor next winter) 'are the best concert singers we have heard in Germany for a long time.' She sang also at Berlin, Dresden, Prague, Vienna, and Munich. Then visiting Rossini at Bologna, she was advised to study opera for a year; she took lessons of Micheroux at Milan. \nIn 1839, she once more made a concert tour, travelling down the Rhine to Düsseldorf, through North Germany to Berlin, and thence to St. Petersburg. Her first appearance on the stage was at Padua in Rossini's \"Semiramide,\" on 6 July 1841. Unqualified successes in Rome, Genoa, and other large Italian cities followed; Rossini sent specially for her to take the soprano part in his just completed \"Stabat Mater.\" Owing to the mismanagement of agents, she was announced to sing at two places – at Rome and Genoa – during the carnival of 1843; the Roman authorities refused a permit to leave the territory and detained her under arrest at Fermo. On her appealing as a British subject to Lord Aberdeen, then English foreign secretary, the matter was arranged by arbitration. Count Gigliucci, the governor of Fermo, fell in love with his prisoner; she agreed to marry him as soon as professional engagements permitted. At Novello's last appearance in Rome she was recalled twenty-nine times; there was some disturbance at Genoa. In March she returned to England, and appeared in English opera at Drury Lane; also in Handel's \"Acis and Galatea,\" and at the Sacred Harmonic Society and other concerts. On 22 November, she was married to Count Gigliucci at Paddington parish church, and retired with him to Italy.\nDuring the troubles of 1848 their property was confiscated, and the countess resolved to resume her public appearances. \nIn 1850, she sang in opera at Rome; then at Lisbon, and on 18 July 1851 re-appeared in London, singing in Handel's \"Messiah\" at Exeter Hall. Her embellishments brought some disapprobation, though her voice was pronounced to have gained in strength, and to have lost nothing of its beauty. She took the place of leading English concert soprano, appearing only once again in England in opera, in \"I Puritani\" at Drury Lane on 5 July 1853. At Milan, she sang in opera during the carnivals from 1854–6. \nIn England her singing was regarded as the embodiment of the best traditions of the Handelian style; like Mara and Catalani before, and Lemmens-Sherrington after, she was specially distinguished in her rendering of 'I know that my Redeemer liveth,' and she sang the opening phrase in one breath. On the opening of the Crystal Palace, on 10 June 1854, her singing, 'heard to remote comers of the building', seemed grander than ever before.\n\nShe was engaged as the soprano soloist for the premiere of the pastorale May Queen by William Sterndale Bennett, a work commissioned for the opening of the Leeds Music Festival in 1858 and conducted by the composer.\n\nProbably the finest revelation of her powers was at the Handel Festival there in June 1859. She then determined to retire. After singing in Handel's 'Messiah' at the Crystal Palace, she made her last appearance at a benefit concert at St. James's Hall on 21 November 1860, the final strain being the National Anthem.\n\nIn her retirement she lived with her husband at Rome and Fermo. He died on 29 March 1893; she died, aged 89, on 12 March 1908, at Rome, leaving a daughter, Valeria. \n\nThe Welsh singer Clara Novello Davies was named for Clara Novello, and her own son Ivor Novello carried on this family name.\n\n\n"}

Ellen is also taken with Richard and ends her engagement with Russell to be with Richard.\n\nEllen convinces Richard to marry her, and they do so quickly. Ellen soon shows her dark side by becoming manipulative and jealous. At their lake house, she causes a rift between Richard and the long time caretaker by insinuating that he hit on her.

Ellen pretends to try and help look for him as they both repeatedly dive in the water, but it is too late, and Danny drowns.\n\nRichard becomes more withdrawn from Ellen and begins sleeping in a guest bedroom at their house. Ellen panics as she loses her grip on Richard, and she goes in the guest room and wakes him up and they have sex. Ellen announces she is pregnant and they seem happy for a little while. Ellen tells Ruth she hates being pregnant and that Richard only cares about the baby, not her. Ellen sees her doctor and tells her she wants an abortion and she has not discussed it with Richard.

Richard, who has begun spending more time with Ruth, admits to her that he thinks Ellen losing the baby was for the best, and that he plans on leaving her because he does not love her anymore, and was only staying with her because of the baby. Ellen makes the connection that Richard is involved with Ruth when she sees the cover of his new book, with Ruth's art. Richard tells her they need some time apart and that he is going to New York for a few days. Beside herself, Ellen begins plotting revenge.\n\nEllen tells Ruth about the sleepless nights and nightmares she has been having and asks Ruth for her prescription barbiturate sleeping pills. Ruth goes to get them for her, and Ellen looks through her purse and finds a plane ticket to New York. Ellen opens all of the capsules and dumps the powder into a sweetener packet and then puts the capsules back together, filling them with talcum powder. At Ellen's birthday party, she asks Richard to talk to her privately in another room, and she alludes to knowing what is going on between him and Ruth. As they argue, he confronts her about Danny's death. She admits to letting him drown because Richard paid more attention to Danny, than to her. Richard hits her causing her to fall, and he storms out of the house. Ruth and Margaret come in to console her, and Ruth stirs the sweetener, that is really the sleeping pill powder placed there by Ellen, into iced tea that Ellen drinks.\n\nLater that same day, Ruth is packing for her trip, she hears Ellen calling out to her and asks her to call the hospital, telling her she took sleeping pills. Ruth believes she is faking it and goes and counts the sleeping pills she gave Ruth, seeing that only one is missing. Ellen ends up dying, and although initially classified as a suicide, Ruth is arrested and put on trial for murder. The district attorney is Ellen's ex-fiancé, Russell and he presents evidence that Ruth was jealous of Ellen and that Ellen sent him a letter mentioning Ruth trying to kill her.

It was launched on 20 July 1974, following the Cypriot coup d'état on 15 July 1974.\n\nThe coup had been ordered by the military Junta in Greece and staged by the Cypriot National Guard in conjunction with EOKA-B. It deposed the Cypriot president Archbishop Makarios III and installed Nikos Sampson. The aim of the coup was the union (\"enosis\") of Cyprus with Greece, and the Hellenic Republic of Cyprus to be declared.\n\nIn July 1974, Turkish forces invaded and captured 3% of the island before a ceasefire was declared. The Greek military junta collapsed and was replaced by a democratic government. In August 1974 another Turkish invasion resulted in the capture of approximately 37% of the island. The ceasefire line from August 1974 became the United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus and is commonly referred to as the Green Line.\n\nAround 150,000 people (amounting to more than one-quarter of the total population of Cyprus, and to one-third of its Greek Cypriot population) were expelled from the occupied northern part of the island, where Greek Cypriots constituted 80% of the population. A little over a year later in 1975, roughly 60,000 Turkish Cypriots, amounting to half the Turkish Cypriot population, were displaced from the south to the north. The Turkish invasion ended in the partition of Cyprus along the UN-monitored Green Line, which still divides Cyprus, and the formation of a \"de facto\" autonomous Turkish Cypriot administration in the north. In 1983 the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) declared independence, although Turkey is the only country that recognises it. The international community considers the TRNC's territory as Turkish-occupied territory of the Republic of Cyprus. The occupation is viewed as illegal under international law, amounting to illegal occupation of European Union territory since Cyprus became its member.\n\nAmong Turkish speakers the operation is also referred as \"Cyprus Peace Operation\" () or \"Operation Peace\" () or \"Cyprus Operation\" (), as they claim that Turkey's military action constituted a peacekeeping operation.\n\nIn 1571 the mostly Greek-populated island of Cyprus was conquered by the Ottoman Empire, following the Ottoman–Venetian War (1570–1573). After 300 years of Ottoman rule the island and its population was leased to Britain by the Cyprus Convention, an agreement reached during the Congress of Berlin in 1878 between the United Kingdom and the Ottoman Empire. Britain formally annexed Cyprus (together with Egypt and Sudan) on 5 November 1914 as a reaction to the Ottoman Empire's decision to join the First World War on the side of the Central Powers; subsequently the island became a British Crown colony, known as British Cyprus. Article 20 of the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 marked the end of the Turkish claim to the island. Article 21 of the treaty gave Turkish nationals ordinarily resident in Cyprus the choice of leaving the island within 2 years or to remain as British subjects.\n\nAt this time the population of Cyprus was composed of both Greeks and Turks, who identified themselves with their respective homeland. However, the elites of both communities shared the belief that they were socially more progressive (better educated and less conservative) and therefore distinct from the mainlanders. Greek and Turkish Cypriots lived quietly side by side for many years.\n\nBroadly, three main forces can be held responsible for transforming two ethnic communities into two national ones: education, British colonial practices, and insular religious teachings accompanying economic development. Formal education was perhaps the most important as it affected Cypriots during childhood and youth; education has been a main vehicle of transferring inter-communal hostility.\n\nBritish colonial policies also promoted ethnic polarisation. The British, many believe, applied the principle of \"divide and rule\", setting the two groups against each other to prevent combined action against colonial rule. For example, when Greek Cypriots rebelled in the 1950s, the colonial office expanded the size of the Auxiliary Police and in September 1955, established the Special Mobile Reserve which was made up exclusively of Turkish Cypriots, to crush EOKA. This and similar practices contributed to inter-communal animosity. \n\nAlthough economic development and increased education reduced the explicitly religious characteristics of the two communities, the growth of nationalism on the two mainlands increased the significance of other differences. Turkish nationalism was at the core of the revolutionary programme promoted by the father of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (1881–1938) and affected Turkish Cypriots who followed his principles. President of the Republic of Turkey from 1923 to 1938, Atatürk attempted to build a new nation on the ruins of the Ottoman Empire and elaborated the programme of \"six principles\" (the \"Six Arrows\") to do so. \n\nThese principles of secularism (laicism) and nationalism reduced Islam's role in the everyday life of individuals and emphasised Turkish identity as the main source of nationalism. Traditional education with a religious foundation was discarded and replaced with one that followed secular principles and, shorn of Arab and Persian influences, was purely Turkish. Turkish Cypriots quickly adopted the secular programme of Turkish nationalism. \n\nUnder Ottoman rule Turkish Cypriots had been classified as Muslims, a distinction based on religion. Being thoroughly secular, Atatürk's programme made their Turkish identity paramount, and may have further reinforced their division from their Greek Cypriot neighbours.\n\nIn the early Fifties a Greek nationalist group was formed called the \"Ethniki Organosis Kyprion Agoniston\" (EOKA, or \"National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters\"). Their objective was to drive the British out of the island first, and then to integrate the island with Greece. EOKA wished to remove all obstacles from their path to independence, or union with Greece.\n\nThe first secret talks for EOKA, as a nationalist organisation established to integrate the island with Greece, were started under the chairmanship of Archbishop Makarios III in Athens on 2 July 1952. In the aftermath of these meetings a \"Council of Revolution\" was established on 7 March 1953. In early 1954 secret weaponry shipments to Cyprus started with the knowledge of the Greek government. Lt. Georgios Grivas, formerly an officer in the Greek army, covertly disembarked on the island on 9 November 1954 and EOKA's campaign against the British forces began to grow.\n\nThe first Turk to be killed by EOKA on 21 June 1955 was a policeman. EOKA also killed Greek Cypriot leftists. After the September 1955 Istanbul Pogrom, EOKA started its activity against Turkish Cypriots.\n\nA year later EOKA revived its attempts to achieve the union of Cyprus with Greece. Turkish Cypriots were recruited into the police by the British forces to fight against Greek Cypriots, but EOKA initially did not want to open up a second front against Turkish Cypriots. However, in January 1957, EOKA forces began targeting and killing Turkish Cypriot police deliberately to provoke Turkish Cypriot riots in Nicosia, which diverted the British army's attention away from their positions in the mountains. In the riots, at least one Greek Cypriot was killed and this was presented by the Greek Cypriot leadership as an act of Turkish aggression. The Turkish Resistance Organisation (TMT, \"Türk Mukavemet Teşkilatı\") was formed initially as a local initiative to prevent the union with Greece, which was seen by the Turkish Cypriots as an existential threat due to the exodus of Cretan Turks from Crete once the union with Greece was achieved. It was later supported and organised directly by the Turkish government, and the TMT declared war on the Greek Cypriot rebels as well.\n\nOn 12 June 1958, eight Greek Cypriot men from Kondemenos village, who were arrested by the British police as part of an armed group suspected of preparing an attack against the Turkish Cypriot quarter of Skylloura, were killed by the TMT near the Turkish Cypriot populated village of Gönyeli, after being dropped off there by the British authorities. TMT also blew up the offices of the Turkish press office in Nicosia to falsely put the blame onto the Greek Cypriots. It also began a string of assassinations of prominent Turkish Cypriot supporters of independence. The following year, after the conclusion of the independence agreements on Cyprus, the Turkish Navy sent a ship to Cyprus fully loaded with arms for the TMT. The ship was stopped and the crew were caught red-handed in the infamous \"Deniz\" incident.\n\nBritish rule lasted until 1960 when the island was declared an independent state under the London-Zurich agreements. The agreement created a foundation for the Republic of Cyprus by the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities, although the republic was seen as a necessary compromise between the two reluctant communities.\n\nThe 1960 Constitution of the Cyprus Republic proved unworkable however, lasting only three years. Greek Cypriots wanted to end the separate Turkish Cypriot municipal councils permitted by the British in 1958, made subject to review under the 1960 agreements. For many Greek Cypriots these municipalities were the first stage on the way to the partition they feared. The Greek Cypriots wanted \"enosis\", integration with Greece, while Turkish Cypriots wanted \"taksim\", partition between Greece and Turkey.\n\nResentment also rose within the Greek Cypriot community because Turkish Cypriots had been given a larger share of governmental posts than the size of their population warranted. In accordance with the constitution 30% of civil service jobs were allocated to the Turkish community despite being only 18.3% of the population. Additionally, the position of vice president was reserved for the Turkish population, and both the president and vice president were given veto power over crucial issues.\n\nIn December 1963 the President of the Republic Makarios proposed thirteen constitutional amendments after the government was blocked by Turkish Cypriot legislators. Frustrated by these impasses and believing that the constitution prevented enosis, the Greek Cypriot leadership believed that the rights given to Turkish Cypriots under the 1960 constitution were too extensive and had designed the Akritas plan, which was aimed at reforming the constitution in favour of Greek Cypriots, persuading the international community about the correctness of the changes and violently subjugating Turkish Cypriots in a few days should they not accept the plan. The amendments would have involved the Turkish community giving up many of their protections as a minority, including adjusting ethnic quotas in the government and revoking the presidential and vice presidential veto power. These amendments were rejected by the Turkish side and the Turkish representation left the government, although there is some dispute over whether they left in protest or whether they were forced out by the National Guard. The 1960 constitution fell apart and communal violence erupted on 21 December 1963, when two Turkish Cypriots were killed at an incident involving the Greek Cypriot police. Turkey, the UK and Greece, the guarantors of the Zürich and London Agreements which had led to Cyprus' independence, wanted to send a NATO force to the island under the command of General Peter Young.\n\nBoth President Makarios and Dr. Küçük issued calls for peace, but these were ignored. Meanwhile, within a week of the violence flaring up, the Turkish army contingent had moved out of its barracks and seized the most strategic position on the island across the Nicosia to Kyrenia road, the historic jugular vein of the island. They retained control of that road until 1974, at which time it acted as a crucial link in Turkey's military invasion. From 1963 up to the point of the Turkish invasion of 20 July 1974, Greek Cypriots who wanted to use the road could only do so if accompanied by a UN convoy.\n\n700 Turkish residents of northern Nicosia, among them women and children, were taken hostage. The violence resulted in the death of 364 Turkish and 174 Greek Cypriots, destruction of 109 Turkish Cypriot or mixed villages and displacement of 25,000–30,000 Turkish Cypriots. The British \"Daily Telegraph\" later called it an \"anti Turkish pogrom\".\n\nThereafter Turkey once again put forward the idea of partition. The intensified fighting especially around areas under the control of Turkish Cypriot militias, as well as the failure of the constitution were used as justification for a possible Turkish invasion. Turkey was on the brink of invading when US president Johnson stated, in his famous letter of 5 June 1964, that the US was against a possible invasion and stated that he would not come to the aid of Turkey if an invasion of Cyprus led to conflict with the Soviet Union. One month later, within the framework of a plan prepared by the US Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, negotiations with Greece and Turkey began.\n\nThe crisis resulted in the end of the Turkish Cypriot involvement in the administration and their claiming that it had lost its legitimacy; the nature of this event is still controversial. In some areas, Greek Cypriots prevented Turkish Cypriots from travelling and entering government buildings, while some Turkish Cypriots willingly refused to withdraw due to the calls of the Turkish Cypriot administration. They started living in enclaves in different areas that were blockaded by the National Guard and were directly supported by Turkey. The republic's structure was changed unilaterally by Makarios and Nicosia was divided by the Green Line, with the deployment of UNFICYP troops. In response to this, their movement and access to basic supplies became more restricted by Greek forces.\n\nFighting broke out again in 1967, as the Turkish Cypriots pushed for more freedom of movement. Once again, the situation was not settled until Turkey threatened to invade on the basis that it would be protecting the Turkish population from ethnic cleansing by Greek Cypriot forces. To avoid that, a compromise was reached for Greece to be forced to remove some of its troops from the island; for Georgios Grivas, EOKA leader, to be forced to leave Cyprus and for the Cypriot government to lift some restrictions of movement and access to supplies of the Turkish populations.\n\nIn the spring of 1974, Greek Cypriot intelligence discovered that EOKA-B was planning a coup against President Makarios which was sponsored by the military junta of Athens.\n\nThe junta had come to power in a military coup in Athens in 1967. In the autumn of 1973 after the 17 November student uprising there had been a further coup in Athens in which the original Greek junta had been replaced by one still more obscurantist headed by the Chief of Military Police, Brigadier Ioannides, though the actual head was General Phaedon Gizikis. Ioannides believed that Makarios was no longer a true supporter of enosis, and suspected him of being a communist sympathiser. This led Ioannides to support the EOKA-B and National Guard as they tried to undermine Makarios.\n\nOn 2 July 1974, Makarios wrote an open letter to President Gizikis complaining bluntly that 'cadres of the Greek military regime support and direct the activities of the 'EOKA-B' terrorist organisation'. He also ordered that Greece remove some 600 Greek officers in the Cypriot National Guard from Cyprus. The Greek Government's immediate reply was to order the go-ahead of the coup. On 15 July 1974 sections of the Cypriot National Guard, led by its Greek officers, overthrew the government.\n\nMakarios narrowly escaped death in the attack. He fled the presidential palace from its back door and went to Paphos, where the British managed to retrieve him by Westland Whirlwind helicopter in the afternoon of 16 July and flew him from Akrotiri to Malta in a Royal Air Force Armstrong Whitworth Argosy transport aircraft and from there to London by de Havilland Comet the next morning.\n\nIn the meantime, Nikos Sampson was declared provisional president of the new government. Sampson was an ultra-nationalist, pro-\"Enosis\" combatant who was known to be fanatically anti-Turkish and had taken part in violence against Turkish civilians in earlier conflicts.\n\nThe Sampson regime took over radio stations and declared that Makarios had been killed; but Makarios, safe in London, was soon able to counteract these reports. In the coup itself, 91 people were killed. The Turkish-Cypriots were not affected by the coup against Makarios; one of the reasons was that Ioannides did not want to provoke a Turkish reaction.\n\nIn response to the coup, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger sent Joseph Sisco to try to mediate the conflict. Turkey issued a list of demands to Greece via a US negotiator. These demands included the immediate removal of Nikos Sampson, the withdrawal of 650 Greek officers from the Cypriot National Guard, the admission of Turkish troops to protect their population, equal rights for both populations, and access to the sea from the northern coast for Turkish Cypriots. Turkey, led by Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit, then appealed to the UK as a signatory of the Treaty of Guarantee to take action to return Cyprus to its neutral status. The UK declined this offer, and refused to let Turkey use its bases on Cyprus as part of the operation.\n\nTurkey invaded Cyprus on Saturday, 20 July 1974. Heavily armed troops landed shortly before dawn at Kyrenia (Girne) on the northern coast meeting resistance from Greek and Greek Cypriot forces. Ankara said that it was invoking its right under the Treaty of Guarantee to protect the Turkish Cypriots and guarantee the independence of Cyprus. \nBy the time the UN Security Council was able to obtain a ceasefire on 22 July the Turkish forces were in command of a narrow path between Kyrenia and Nicosia, 3% of the territory of Cyprus,\nwhich they succeeded in widening, violating the ceasefire demanded in Resolution 353.\n\nOn 20 July, the 10,000 inhabitants of the Turkish Cypriot enclave of Limassol surrendered to the Cypriot National Guard. Following this, according to Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot eyewitness accounts, the Turkish Cypriot quarter was burned, women raped and children shot. 1,300 Turkish Cypriots were confined in a prison camp afterwards. The enclave in Famagusta was subjected to shelling and the Turkish Cypriot town of Lefka was occupied by Greek Cypriot troops.\n\nAccording to the International Committee of the Red Cross, the prisoners of war taken at this stage and before the second invasion included 385 Greek Cypriots in Adana, 63 Greek Cypriots in the Saray Prison and 3,268 Turkish Cypriots in various camps in Cyprus.\n\nOn 23 July 1974 the Greek military junta collapsed mainly because of the events in Cyprus. Greek political leaders in exile started returning to the country. On 24 July 1974 Constantine Karamanlis returned from Paris and was sworn in as Prime Minister. He kept Greece from entering the war, an act that was highly criticised as an act of treason. Shortly after this Nikos Sampson renounced the presidency and Glafcos Clerides temporarily took the role of president.\n\nThe first round of peace talks took place in Geneva, Switzerland between 25 and 30 July 1974, James Callaghan, the British Foreign Secretary, having summoned a conference of the three guarantor powers. There they issued a declaration that the Turkish occupation zone should not be extended, that the Turkish enclaves should immediately be evacuated by the Greeks, and that a further conference should be held at Geneva with the two Cypriot communities present to restore peace and re-establish constitutional government. In advance of this they made two observations, one upholding the 1960 constitution, the other appearing to abandon it. They called for the Turkish Vice-President to resume his functions, but they also noted 'the existence in practice of two autonomous administrations, that of the Greek Cypriot community and that of the Turkish Cypriot community'.\n\nBy the time that the second Geneva conference met on 14 August 1974, international sympathy (which had been with the Turks in their first attack) was swinging back towards Greece now that she had restored democracy. At the second round of peace talks, Turkey demanded that the Cypriot government accept its plan for a federal state, and population transfer. When the Cypriot acting president Clerides asked for 36 to 48 hours in order to consult with Athens and with Greek Cypriot leaders, the Turkish Foreign Minister denied Clerides that opportunity on the grounds that Makarios and others would use it to play for more time.\n\nThe Turkish Foreign Minister Turan Güneş had said to the Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit, \"When I say 'Ayşe should go on vacation' (Turkish: \"\"Ayşe Tatile Çıksın\"\"), it will mean that our armed forces are ready to go into action. Even if the telephone line is tapped, that would rouse no suspicion.\" An hour and a half after the conference broke up, Turan Güneş called Ecevit and said the code phrase. On 14 August Turkey launched its \"Second Peace Operation\", which eventually resulted in the Turkish occupation of 37% of Cyprus. Britain's then foreign secretary (later prime minister) James Callaghan later disclosed that U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger \"vetoed\" at least one British military action to pre-empt the Turkish landing. Turkish occupation reached as far south as the Louroujina Salient.\n\nIn the process, many Greek Cypriots became refugees. The number of refugees is estimated to be between 140,000 and 160,000.\nThe ceasefire line from 1974 separates the two communities on the island, and is commonly referred to as the Green Line.\n\nAfter the conflict, Cypriot representatives and the United Nations consented to the transfer of the remainder of the 51,000 Turkish Cypriots that had not left their homes in the south to settle in the north, if they wished to do so.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council has challenged the legality of Turkey's action, because Article Four of the Treaty of Guarantee gives the right to guarantors to take action with the sole aim of re-establishing the state of affairs. The aftermath of Turkey's invasion, however, did not safeguard the Republic's sovereignty and territorial integrity, but had the opposite effect: the \"de facto\" partition of the Republic and the creation of a separate political entity in the north. On 13 February 1975, Turkey declared the occupied areas of the Republic of Cyprus to be a \"Federated Turkish State\", to the universal condemnation of the international community (see United Nations Security Council Resolution 367). The United Nations recognises the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus according to the terms of its independence in 1960. The conflict continues to affect Turkey's relations with Cyprus, Greece, and the European Union.\n\n\"Note\"\nTurkey was found guilty by the European Commission of Human Rights for displacement of persons, deprivation of liberty, ill treatment, deprivation of life and deprivation of possessions. The Turkish policy of violently forcing a third of the island's Greek population from their homes in the occupied North, preventing their return and settling Turks from the mainland there is considered an example of ethnic cleansing.\n\nIn 1976 and again in 1983, the European Commission of Human Rights found Turkey guilty of repeated violations of the European Convention of Human Rights. Turkey has been condemned for preventing the return of Greek Cypriot refugees to their properties. The European Commission of Human Rights reports of 1976 and 1983 state the following:\n\nEnclaved Greek Cypriots in the Karpass Peninsula in 1975 were subjected by the Turks to violations of their human rights so that by 2001 when the European Court of Human Rights found Turkey guilty of the violation of 14 articles of the European Convention of Human Rights in its judgement of Cyprus v. Turkey (application no. 25781/94), less than 600 still remained. In the same judgement, Turkey was found guilty of violating the rights of the Turkish Cypriots by authorising the trial of civilians by a military court.\n\nThe European commission of Human Rights with 12 votes against 1, accepted evidence from the Republic of Cyprus, concerning the rapes of various Greek-Cypriot women by Turkish soldiers and the torture of many Greek-Cypriot prisoners during the invasion of the island. The high rate of rape resulted in the temporary permission of abortion in Cyprus by the conservative Cypriot Orthodox Church. According to Paul Sant Cassia, rape was used systematically to \"soften\" resistance and clear civilian areas through fear. Many of the atrocities were seen as revenge for the atrocities against Turkish Cypriots in 1963–64 and the massacres during the first invasion. It has been suggested that many of the atrocities were revenge killings, committed by Turkish Cypriot fighters in military uniform who might have been mistaken for Turkish soldiers. In the Karpass Peninsula, a group of Turkish Cypriots, called a \"death squad\", reportedly chose young girls to rape and impregnated teenage girls. There were cases of rapes, which included gang rapes, of teenage girls by Turkish soldiers and Turkish Cypriot men in the peninsula, and one case involved the rape of an old Greek Cypriot man by a Turkish Cypriot. The man was reportedly identified by the victim and two other rapists were also arrested. Raped women were sometimes outcast from society.\n\nNumerous atrocities against the Turkish Cypriot community were committed during the invasion of the island. In the Maratha, Santalaris and Aloda massacre by EOKA B, 126 people were killed on 14 August 1974. The United Nations described the massacre as a crime against humanity, by saying \"constituting a further crime against humanity committed by the Greek and Greek Cypriot gunmen.\" In the Tochni (Taşkent) massacre, 85 Turkish inhabitants were massacred.\n\nThe \"Washington Post\" covered another news of atrocity in which it is written that: \"In a Greek raid on a small Turkish village near Limassol, 36 people out of a population of 200 were killed. The Greeks said that they had been given orders to kill the inhabitants of the Turkish villages before the Turkish forces arrived.\"\n\nIn Limassol, upon the fall of the Turkish Cypriot enclave to the Cypriot National Guard, the Turkish Cypriot quarter was burned, women raped and children shot according to Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot eyewitness accounts. The rapes reportedly included those of \"very young girls\", who were brought back home after being raped and \"thrown over the threshold.\" 1300 people were then led to a prison camp.\n\nThe issue of missing persons in Cyprus took a new turn in the summer of 2007 when the UN-sponsored Committee on Missing Persons (CMP) began returning remains of identified missing individuals to their families (see end of section).\n\nHowever, since 2004, the whole issue of missing persons in Cyprus took a new turn after the Committee on Missing Persons (CMP) designed and started to implement (as from August 2006) its project on the Exhumation, Identification and Return of Remains of Missing Persons. The whole project is being implemented by bi-communal teams of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriot scientists (archaeologists, anthropologists and geneticists) under the overall responsibility of the CMP. By the end of 2007, 57 individuals had been identified and their remains returned to their families.\n\nThe missing persons list of the Republic of Cyprus confirms that 83 Turkish Cypriots disappeared in Tochni on 14 August 1974. Also, as a result of the invasion, over 2000 Greek-Cypriot prisoners of war were taken to Turkey and detained in Turkish prisons. Some of them were not released and are still missing. In particular, the Committee on Missing Persons (CMP) in Cyprus, which operates under the auspices of the United Nations, is mandated to investigate approximately 1600 cases of Greek Cypriot and Greek missing persons.\n\nIn 1989, the government of Cyprus took an American art dealer to court for the return of four rare 6th-century Byzantine mosaics that survived an edict by the Byzantine Emperor, imposing the destruction of all images of sacred figures. Cyprus won the case, and the mosaics were eventually returned. In October 1997, Aydın Dikmen, who had sold the mosaics, was arrested in Germany in a police raid and found to be in possession of a stash consisting of mosaics, frescoes and icons dating back to the 6th, 12th and 15th centuries, worth over $50 million. The mosaics, depicting Saints Thaddeus and Thomas, are two more sections from the apse of the Kanakaria Church, while the frescoes, including the Last Judgement and the Tree of Jesse, were taken off the north and south walls of the Monastery of Antiphonitis, built between the 12th and 15th centuries. Frescoes found in possession of Dikmen included those from the 11th–12th century Church of Panagia Pergaminiotisa in Akanthou, which had been completely stripped of its ornate frescoes.\n\nAccording to a Greek Cypriot claim, since 1974, at least 55 churches have been converted into mosques and another 50 churches and monasteries have been converted into stables, stores, hostels, or museums, or have been demolished. According to the government spokesman of the \"de facto\" Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, this has been done to keep the buildings from falling into ruin.\n\nIn January 2011, the British singer Boy George returned an 18th-century icon of Christ to the Church of Cyprus that he had bought without knowing the origin. The icon, which had adorned his home for 26 years, had been looted from the church of St Charalampus from the village of New Chorio, near Kythrea, in 1974. The icon was noticed by church officials during a television interview of Boy George at his home. The church contacted the singer who agreed to return the icon at Saints Anargyroi Church, Highgate, north London.\n\nGreek Cypriots have claimed that the invasion and subsequent actions by Turkey have been diplomatic ploys, furthered by ultranationalist Turkish militants to justify expansionist Pan-Turkism. They have also criticised the perceived failure of Turkish intervention to achieve or justify its stated goals (protecting the sovereignty, integrity, and independence of the Republic of Cyprus), claiming that Turkey's intentions from the beginning were to create the state of Northern Cyprus.\n\nGreek Cypriots condemn the brutality of the Turkish invasion, including but not limited to the high levels of rape, child rape and torture. Greek Cypriots emphasise that in 1976 and 1983 Turkey was found guilty by the European Commission of Human Rights of repeated violations of the European Convention of Human Rights.\n\nGreek Cypriots have also claimed that the second wave of the Turkish invasion that occurred in August 1974, even after the Greek Junta had collapsed on 24 July 1974 and the democratic government of the Republic of Cyprus had been restored under Glafkos Clerides, did not constitute a justified intervention as had been the case with the first wave of the Turkish invasion that led to the Junta's collapse.\n\nThe stationing of 40,000 Turkish troops on Northern Cyprus after the invasion in violation of resolutions by the United Nations has also been criticised.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council Resolution 353, adopted unanimously on 20 July 1974, in response to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, the Council demanded the immediate withdrawal of all foreign military personnel present in the Republic of Cyprus in contravention of paragraph 1 of the United Nations Charter.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council Resolution 360 adopted on 16 August 1974 declared their respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus, and formally recorded its disapproval of the unilateral military actions taken against it by Turkey.\n\nTurkish Cypriot opinion quotes President Archbishop Makarios III, overthrown by the Greek Junta in the 1974 coup, who opposed immediate Enosis (union between Cyprus and Greece). Makarios described the coup which replaced him as \"an invasion of Cyprus by Greece\" in his speech to the UN security council and stated that there were \"no prospects\" of success in the talks aimed at resolving the situation between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, as long as the leaders of the coup, sponsored and supported by Greece, were in power.\n\nIn Resolution 573, the Council of Europe supported the legality of the first wave of the Turkish invasion that occurred in July 1974, as per Article 4 of the Guarantee Treaty of 1960, which allows Turkey, Greece, and the United Kingdom to unilaterally intervene militarily in failure of a multilateral response to crisis in Cyprus. The Court of Appeal in Athens further stated in 1979 that the first wave of the Turkish invasion was legal and that \"The real culprits... are the Greek officers who engineered and staged a coup and prepared the conditions for the invasion\".\n\nThe opinion that Turkey historically orchestrated a pretext to the invasion, prevalent within the Greek Cypriot community, is also held by some Turkish Cypriots and promoted by some Turkish Cypriot publications. This belief is corroborated by a statement made by the Turkish occupation representative, Rauf Denktash, in which he suggests the existence of ulterior political motives:\n\nGreek-Cypriots who were unhappy with the United States not stopping the Turkish invasion took part in protests and riots in front of the American embassy. Ambassador Rodger Davies, was assassinated during the protests by a sniper from the extremist EOKA-B group.\n\nIn 1983 the Turkish Cypriot assembly declared independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Immediately upon this declaration Britain convened a meeting of the United Nations Security Council to condemn the declaration as \"legally invalid\". United Nations Security Council Resolution 541 (1983) considered the \"attempt to create the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is invalid, and will contribute to a worsening of the situation in Cyprus\". It went on to state that it \"considers the declaration referred to above as legally invalid and calls for its withdrawal\".\n\nIn the following year UN resolution 550 (1984) condemned the \"exchange of Ambassadors\" between Turkey and the TRNC and went on to add that the Security Council \"considers attempts to settle any part of Varosha by people other than its inhabitants as inadmissible and calls for the transfer of this area to the administration of the United Nations\".\n\nNeither Turkey nor the TRNC have complied with the above resolutions and Varosha remains uninhabited. In 2017, Varosha's beach was opened to be exclusively used by Turks (Turkish-Cypriots and Turkish nationals).\n\nOn 22 July 2010, United Nations' International Court of Justice decided that \"International law contains no prohibition on declarations of independence\". In response to this non-legally-binding direction, German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said it \"has nothing to do with any other cases in the world\" including Cyprus, whereas some researchers stated the decision of ICJ provided the Turkish Cypriots an option to be used.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council decisions for the immediate unconditional withdrawal of all foreign troops from Cyprus soil and the safe return of the refugees to their homes have not been implemented by Turkey and the TRNC. Turkey and TRNC defend their position, stating that any such withdrawal would have led to a resumption of intercommunal fighting and killing.\n\nIn 1999, UNHCR halted its assistance activities for internally displaced persons in Cyprus.\n\nNegotiations to find a solution to the Cyprus problem have been taking place on and off since 1964. Between 1974 and 2002, the Turkish Cypriot side was seen by the international community as the side refusing a balanced solution. Since 2002, the situation has been reversed according to US and UK officials, and the Greek Cypriot side rejected a plan which would have called for the dissolution of the Republic of Cyprus without guarantees that the Turkish occupation forces would be removed. The latest Annan Plan to reunify the island which was endorsed by the United States, United Kingdom and Turkey was accepted by a referendum by Turkish Cypriots but overwhelmingly rejected in parallel referendum by Greek Cypriots, after the Greek Cypriot Leadership and Greek Orthodox Church urged the Greek population to vote \"no\".\n\nGreek Cypriots rejected the UN settlement plan in an April 2004 referendum. On 24 April 2004, the Greek Cypriots rejected by a three-to-one margin the plan proposed by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the settlement of the Cyprus dispute. The plan, which was approved by a two-to-one margin by the Turkish Cypriots in a separate but simultaneous referendum, would have created a United Cyprus Republic and ensured that the entire island would reap the benefits of Cyprus's entry into the European Union on 1 May. The plan would have created a United Cyprus Republic consisting of a Greek Cypriot constituent state and a Turkish Cypriot constituent state linked by a federal government. More than half of the Greek Cypriots who were displaced in 1974 and their descendants would have had their properties returned to them and would have lived in them under Greek Cypriot administration within a period of 3.5 to 42 months after the entry into force of the settlement. For those whose property could not be returned, they would have received monetary compensation.\nThe entire island entered the EU on 1 May 2004 still divided, although the EU acquis communautaire – the body of common rights and obligations – applies only to the areas under direct government control, and is suspended in the areas occupied by the Turkish military and administered by Turkish Cypriots. However, individual Turkish Cypriots able to document their eligibility for Republic of Cyprus citizenship legally enjoy the same rights accorded to other citizens of European Union states. The Greek Cypriot government in Nicosia continues to oppose EU efforts to establish direct trade and economic links to TRNC as a way of encouraging the Turkish Cypriot community to continue to support the resolution of the Cyprus dispute.\n\nAs a result of the Turkish invasion, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe stated that the demographic structure of the island has been continuously modified as a result of the deliberate policies of the Turks. Following the occupation of Northern Cyprus, civilian settlers from Turkey began arriving on the island. Despite the lack of consensus on the exact figures, all parties concerned admitted that Turkish nationals began arriving in the northern part of the island in 1975. It was suggested that over 120,000 settlers came to Cyprus from mainland Turkey.

He was the eldest son of Samuel Ogle (1659–1719), Member of Parliament for , and commissioner of the revenue for Ireland, by his second wife, Ursula, daughter of Sir Robert Markham, 2nd Baronet, and widow of Altham Annesley, 1st Baron Altham.\n\nSamuel Ogle became a captain of a cavalry regiment in the British Army. Appointed as Provincial Governor of Maryland by Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore on 7 December 1731, he was dispatched to Colonial America in 1732.\n\nUnder Ogle's leadership Maryland quickly became engaged in a border dispute with Pennsylvania. Several settlers were taken prisoners on both sides and Penn sent a committee to Governor Ogle to resolve the situation. Rioting broke out in the disputed territory (now known as Cresap's War) and Ogle appealed to the King George II for resolution.\n\nFaced with this situation, Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore arrived in Maryland and assumed charge of the colony in December 1732. Upon Calvert's arrival, Ogle retired from the governorship for the first time. He would do this twice more.

Along with Trinity School of John Whitgift and Old Palace School it is owned by the Whitgift Foundation, a charitable trust. The school was previously a grammar school and direct grant grammar school, but the school's headmaster is now a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference.\n\nWhitgift School was founded in 1596 by the Archbishop of Canterbury John Whitgift and opened in 1600 as part of the Whitgift Foundation which had the aim of building a hospital and school in Croydon for the \"poor, needy and impotent people\" from the parishes of Croydon and Lambeth. Originally located in North End, Croydon in 1931 it moved to its current site, Haling Park, which was once home to Lord Howard of Effingham, the Lord High Admiral of the Fleet sent against the Spanish Armada. The school was previously a grammar school and direct grant grammar school, but the school's headmaster is now a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference.\n\nOriginally a day school, boarding was introduced in 1992, and a boarding house was opened for the 2013–14 school year. Between 1871 and 1946 the school was known as Whitgift Grammar School, after which it relinquished its direct grant and became a fully independent school known as 'Whitgift School'.\n\nWhitgift is located in a parkland site. The ship (a model of HMS \"Ark Royal\", the flagship of Lord Howard of Effingham against the Spanish Armada) that features prominently on the top of the school hall is a reminder of the history of the site. Additions since the 400th anniversary of the school have been a maze in the founder's garden, an aviary, an enclosure for Prevost's squirrels, ponds and a sports complex.\n\nThe original buildings have been supplemented by many additions and improvements including a Music School and Concert Hall, an integrated facility for science, technology, art and design together with library and resource centres, a separate Lower School building, and a major new Sports and Conference Centre which was opened in February 2005. A new Art Department, Performing Arts Centre and a new Sixth Form Centre were completed in the middle of 2011.\n\nWhitgift has a wide variety of animals, including peacocks on the grounds since the 1930s, and flamingos. In 2005 Sir David Attenborough visited the school to open the ponds, the enclosure of which also houses various waterfowl, including Hawaiian geese, which the zoo successfully bred.\n\nMost boys are admitted to the school at the ages of 10 or 11. Smaller numbers of boys enter the school at 12, 13, 14 and 16. Entry is based on performance in entrance exams and interviews, and an assessment of a boy's ability to contribute to wider school life and to benefit from the co-curricular activities offered. Scholarships are awarded, offering a remission of up to 50% of the school fees. Aside from academic scholarships, they may be awarded for particular talent in music, art, design technology or sport, or as an all-rounder. A substantial number of bursaries are also awarded up to the value of the full fees.\n\nIn year 7, boys must choose three languages to study; one Romance (French/Spanish), one inflected (German/Latin) and one Oriental (Japanese/Mandarin). In year 9, boys can drop a language, but can also take up either Italian or Ancient Greek which is studied off-timetable. In the Fifth Form, boys undertake a broad curriculum in a mixture of GCSE and IGCSE subjects.\n\nSince 2005, Whitgift has offered the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme to the Sixth Form as an optional alternative to A-Levels, as well as BTEC qualifications in sport and business studies.\n\nWhitgift School offers co-curricular activities within the school. This is reflected in the sporting facilities as well as an array of musical activities.\n\nWhitgift has a combined cadet force. The school has partnerships with two local state schools St. Andrews C of E High School and Thomas More School, allowing their students to take part in CCF activities.\n\nThe school has a sporting tradition, and fields teams in a range of sports. Whitgift has a sports and conference centre which hosts competitions in a wide range of sports the Health & Fitness Centre, a 55 station gym and group exercise studio are open to students and their families. Whitgift has a number of former sporting professionals currently coaching at the school. These include the former Surrey cricketer David Ward, the former Chelsea and Arsenal defender Colin Pates, the former Surrey spin bowler Neil Kendrick, and the former Crystal Palace and Chelsea midfielder and manager at Selhurst Park Steve Kember. The school was also once a training ground to Crystal Palace The Women’s GB Handball team has trained on occasions at Whitgift School as has the England Korfball team.\n\nIn rugby, the school has twice won the National Daily Mail Cup at Under 15 level (1999, 2003) and three times at under 18 level (2010, 2011, 2019). In hockey Whitgift won the National Indoor Hockey Championships at Under 15 and Under 18 levels in 2011. The school also become national Under 18 golf champions for the first time in 2014 at Carnoustie. In 2011 The school had links to the academies of Charlton, Chelsea and Crystal Palace football clubs, to Surrey County Cricket Club, London Wasps rugby club and East Grinstead Hockey Club. The first recorded cricket match held on the school ground occurred in 1898 when the school played University College School. From 2003 to 2011 the school ground hosted 12 List-A matches for county club Surrey.\n\nFormer pupils of Whitgift are known as \"Old Whitgiftians\".\n\n\nThe Southern Railway V Class was known as the Schools Class because all 40 locomotives were named after public schools. \"Whitgift\", SR no. 916 and BR no. 30916, was built in 1934 and withdrawn in 1962. The Whitgift nameplate that was formerly mounted on the front driving wheel-splasher of the locomotive is now on display in the Raeburn Library in the school.

These contrast with varieties of \"air lime\", the other common types of lime mortar, which set through carbonation (re-absorbing carbon dioxide (CO) from the air).\n\nHydraulic lime provides a faster initial set and higher compressive strength than air lime and \"eminently hydraulic lime\" will set in more extreme conditions including under water.\n\nThe terms \"hydraulic lime\" and \"hydrated lime\" are quite similar and may be confused but are not necessarily the same material: hydrated lime is \"any\" lime which has been slaked whether it sets through hydration, carbonation, or both.\n\nCalcium reacts in the lime kiln with the clay minerals to produce silicates that enable some of the lime to set through hydration; any unreacted calcium is slaked to calcium hydroxide which sets through carbonation: These are sometimes called \"semi-hydraulic lime\" and include the classifications feebly and moderately hydraulic lime, NHL 2 and NHL 3.5.\n\nThere are two basic types of hydraulic limes:\n\nNatural hydraulic lime (NHL) is produced by heating (calcining) limestone that \"naturally\" contains clay and other impurities: no materials may be added to create the hydraulicity. In the United States NHL may be called \"hydrated hydraulic lime\" (HHL) per ASTM C-141 Standard Specification for Hydrated Hydraulic Lime for Structural Purposes.\n\nArtificial hydraulic lime (AHL) or artificial lime (AL) becomes hydraulic when hydraulic and/or pozzolan materials are added either before or after burning in a lime kiln. Artificial limes are more specifically identified as \"hydraulic lime\" (HL), as defined European Norm 459 (EN-459), \"Consists of lime and other materials such as Portland cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, limestone filler and other suitable materials.\"; \"formulated lime\" (FL) (EN-459) consists of \"...mainly of hydrated lime and or NHL with added hydraulic and/or pozzolanic material. It is identical to HL but its composition must be declared on the CE marking.\"; \"pozzolanic hydraulic lime\" (PHL) (ASTM C-1707)is \"very similar to HL or FL. Consists mainly of hydrated lime with one or more pozzolans with possible inclusion of inert filler. When Portland cement, even traces, is present (can be up to 20% of binder weight), it has to be labeled as 'PHLc'.\"\n\nHydraulic lime is a useful building material for the following reasons:\n\n\nHydraulic lime concretes have been in use since Roman times, either as mass foundation concretes or as lightweight concretes using tufa or pumice as aggregates and a wide range of pozzolans to achieve different strengths and speeds of set. This meant that lime could be used in a wide variety of applications including floors and even vaults or domes. An example is the Pantheon in Rome, which has survived for nearly two thousand years. The dome's diameter is equal to its height from the floor. It is constructed from six different lime mixes, which change the properties and lightness of the material.\n\nNatural hydraulic lime (NHL) is classified for different uses the first two of which are sometimes called semi-hydraulic lime because they initially set with water but continue to set in contact with carbon dioxide in the air.\n\nFeebly hydraulic lime (NHL 2) is used for internal work and external work in sheltered areas.\n\nFeebly hydraulic lime contains up to 10% clay/ clay mixed with other impurities. It might take one week or more to set after the addition of water. Setting is the process of permanently taking the shape into which lime has been moulded.\n\nModerately hydraulic lime (NHL 3.5) can be used for external work in most areas.\n\nModerately hydraulic lime contains clay in the range of 11% to 20%. This type of lime sets (assumes given shape) within a few days after the addition of water.\n\nEminently hydraulic lime (NHL 5) is used for external work in exposed areas, such as chimneys and for floor slabs/underpinning.\n\nEminently hydraulic lime contains clay in the range of 21% to 30%. Properties of eminently hydraulic lime are close to those of cement. Eminently hydraulic lime sets within one day after the addition of water.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1561 he became a fellow of his college and took holy orders.\n\nStill was appointed in 1570 to be Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity, and later held livings in Suffolk, where he was Archdeacon of Sudbury from 1576 to 1593, and Yorkshire. He was then Master successively of St John's College (1574) and of Trinity College (1577). Still Vice-Chancellor of his university in 1575/1576 and again in 1592/1593, he was raised to the bishopric of Bath and Wells in 1593. In 1604 he bought the manor of Hutton, Somerset, east of Wells and to the west of the Mendip Hills, with its residence, Hutton Court.\n\nJohn Still died on 26 February 1608, leaving a large fortune from lead mines discovered in the Mendips. There is a fine monument to him in the north transept of Wells Cathedral, erected by his son Nathaniel.\n\nJohn Still was married twice:\n\nWells Cathedral has a large canopied tomb with a recumbent effigy of the Bishop, situated against the east wall of the chapel between the north aisle and the Chapter House. It was repainted in the 19th century. It bears a Latin inscription:\n\n\"Memoriae sacrum Joanni Still Episcopo Bathoniensi et Wellensi, Sacras Theologia Doctori Acerrimo Christianae Veritatis propugnatori non minus vitas integritate quam veria doctrina claro qui cum Domino diu vigilasset in Christo spe certa resurgendi obdormivit die XXVI Februarii mdcvii Vixit annos LXIIII sedit episcopus XVI Nathaniel Still filius primogenitus optimo patri maerens pietatis ergo posuit\"\nAbove it are three escutcheons, left to right: \"Azure, a saltire per saltire and per cross counter changed argent and or\" (See of Wells); the same, impaling Still; Still, alone.\n\nThere exists also a stone memorial to Nathaniel Still (died 1626), son of Bishop Still. Nathaniel kneels at prayer to left in front of his own son, who predeceased him. Kneeling opposite is his wife Jane Whitmore in front of their daughters. Below is a text alluding to the Bishop, who \"first raised the name\" (of Still):\n\n\"In memory of Nathanill Still of this parrish Esq., who dyed the second day of February Anno Domini 1626. Not that he needeth monuments of stone for his well-gotten fame to rest uppon but this was reard to testifie that hee lives in theire loves ye yet surviving for unto vertu who first raised his name hee left the preservation of the same and to posterity remaine it shall when brass and marble monuments shall fall\"\n\n\"Gammer Gurton's Needle\" is the second earliest extant English comedy, properly so called. Still, whose reputation as a serious churchman cannot easily be reconciled with the buffoonery in \"A Ryght Pithy, Pleasaunt and merie Comedie: Intytuled Gammer Gurtons Nedle\", was first credited with its authorship by Isaac Reed in his 1782 edition of \"Biographia dramatica.\" The title-page of the piece, which was printed by Thomas Colwell in 1575, states that it was played not long ago at Christ's College, Cambridge, and was \"made by Mr S. Mr of Art.\" A play was acted at Christmas 1567, and Still was identified as being the only MA on the register at that time whose name began with S.\n\nThere are reasons to suppose, however, that the play had been in Colwell's hands some time before it was printed, and it may well be identical with the \"Dyccon of Bedlam\" for which he took out a licence in 1562–1563, \"Diccon the Bedlem\" being first in the dramatis personae of \"Gammer Gurton\". The accounts of Christ's College for 1559–1560 include the entry, \"Spent at Mr Stevenson's plaie, 5s.\"\n\nWilliam Stevenson was born at Hunwick, Durham, matriculated in 1546, took his MA degree in 1553, and became BD in 1560. He was a fellow of Christ's College in 1559–1561 and can perhaps to be identified with a William Stevenson who was a fellow in 1551–1554. If so, there is reason to believe that the composition of \"Gammer Gurton's Needle\" should be ascribed to the earlier period. Stevenson was made prebendary of Durham in 1560–1561 and died in 1575.\n\nContemporary Puritan writers in the Marprelate tracts allude to Dr John Bridges, Dean of Salisbury, author of \"A Defence of the Government of the Church of England\", as the reputed author of \"Gammer Gurton's Needle\", but he obviously could not be properly described as \"Mr. S\". Dr Bridges took his MA degree at Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1560. The wit and periodic coarseness of his acknowledged work makes it reasonable to suppose he may have been a coadjutor of the author.\n\nIn the light of the authorship discussion, \"Gammer Gurton's Needle\" is thought to date from about 1553. Though less overt in its use of Latin comedic conventions than its contemporary \"Ralph Roister Doister\", several scholars have noted the play's parodic treatment of Terentian comedy. The plot centres on the loss of a needle belonging to Gammer Gurton, eventually found when her servant, Hodge, is slapped on the buttocks by the trickster Diccon and discovers it in the seat of his breeches.\n\n\n"}

Her father, a furniture salesman, was often away on business.\n\nDavis began working for Walt Disney's Kansas City company, Laugh-O-Gram Studio, in 1923. She was hired to act in a film called \"Alice's Wonderland\", which combined live action with animation. When Laugh-O-Gram failed and Disney moved to Los Angeles, on the basis of \"Alice's Wonderland\" Winkler Pictures signed Disney for a series known as the \"Alice Comedies\", or \"Alice in Cartoonland.\" Disney convinced Davis' family to bring her from Missouri to Los Angeles to star in the series. During this time, Davis resided at the La Brea Apartments in Hollywood, California.\n\nIn 1925, Davis played the role of Resi in \"The Greater Glory\", a First National Pictures production. The film's director, Curt Rehfeld, remarked that Davis \"... has the technique of a finished artist, the unusual ability to follow direction and the disposition of an angel. Not once during the picture was it necessary for me to explain any angle twice and, with all of her mature understanding, the youthful charm still remains, making a rare and appreciated combination.\"\n\nWhile filming \"The Greater Glory\", Davis signed a contract with Harry Carey and the two actors worked together in \"The Man From Red Gulch\" (1925).\n\nIn December 1929, Davis was in the cast of \"The Blue Bird\" at the Pasadena Playhouse. The fairy play included Janet Horning, a child actress who was only two years old. The cast included 150 children.\n\nRecalling her work on the \"Alice Comedies\", Davis said, \"It was a great time – full of fun, adventure, and 'let's pretend.' I adored and idolized Walt, as any child would. He would direct me in a large manner with great sweeping gestures. One of my favorite pictures was \"Alice's Wild West Show\". I was always the kid with the curls, but I was really a tomboy, and that picture allowed me to act tough. I took great joy in that.\"\n\nOver the next 20 years, she went on to work at other Hollywood studios as a child actress and, later, as a supporting actress. She sang, danced, and acted in such films as \"Flying Down to Rio\" (1933), \"Young and Beautiful\" (1934), \"College Holiday\" (1936), \"Vivacious Lady\" (1938), \"Three on a Match\" (1932), \"Week-End in Havana\" (1941), \"Song of the Islands\" (1942) and \"The Harvey Girls\" (1946) among others. On several occasions, she used the screen name Mary Daily, and appeared in such films as \"Hands Across the Rockies\" (1941) with cowboy star Bill Elliott. During her Hollywood tenure, she also occasionally worked for her old boss, Walt Disney, did a vocal test for \"Snow White\", voiced some supporting characters in \"Pinocchio\" and served a short stint in the Disney Studio's Ink-and-Paint department.\n\nIn 1943, she married Navy aviator Robert McGhee, and the couple had two daughters. During their 59-year marriage, they resided in New Jersey, Connecticut, Southern California, and Idaho. Over a 25-year period, Virginia worked as a real estate agent mostly in the Irvine, California and Boise, Idaho areas.\n\nAfter a year of failing health, Virginia Davis-McGhee died of natural causes in her home in Corona, California on August 15, 2009, aged 90.\n\nIn 1998, Virginia received a Disney Legends award for Animation.\n\n"}

{"id": "1958962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958962", "title": "Huxley (video game)", "text": "Huxley (video game)\n\nHuxley () was a multiplayer first-person shooter computer game with persistent player characters published by Webzen Games Inc.. It was being developed for Microsoft Windows. An Xbox 360 port was planned, but it has been put on an indeterminate hold. \"Huxley\" initially was going to be cross platform, but according to statements made at the 2009 E3 Expo press conference that feature is currently excluded from development. The contract to operate the game in China was sold to The9 for $35 million USD on February 12, 2007, considered the largest export transaction to date for a Korean-developed game.\n\nA trailer for the game was released in 2007 as a special DVD used to demonstrate LG LCD TVs.\n\nIn June 2009 NHN USA released the first English Closed Beta Test via its free games portal ijji.com. The initial test had a small number of users and was carried out over a space of two weeks. Keys for the test were made available through ijji (Globally) and FilePlanet (USA and Canada).\n\nThe second Closed Beta Test was initiated in late-July 2009 and lasted until August 12. The second test allowed many more players to test the game. During the last two days of the test a high-volume stress test was carried out on to the servers where everyone with an ijji account was permitted to play the game during test hours.\n\nIn April 2010 Huxley was integrated with Hangame game portal and went into open beta on May 3.\n\nIn August 2010 an official message was posted on the North American Huxley forums at IJJI. Huxley for the North American region will now be self hosted by Webzen.\n\nOn December 30, 2010, the Korean service for \"Huxley\" was discontinued.\n\nIn the near future, Nuclearites bombarded the world. Destructive earthquakes, massive tsunami and dramatic climate changes wreak havoc around the globe, isolating continents and driving the human race into chaos. Those who survive the destruction dream of tranquillity, but an eruption among the human race and the appearance of horrible mutants drives the world into further disorder. Racism and oppression cause rebellious uprisings and war that divide the landscape between two powers: Sapiens and Alternative. At the heart of the war emerges a powerful energy source called the Lunarites. The Lunarites were created by Huxley, a scientist and possible saviour.\n\nBoth factions seek glory and victory, fighting mercilessly for the Lunarites and their very existence.\n\nThe story was thought to be based on the novel \"Brave New World\" by Aldous Huxley, hence the name, however Webzen has stated there are no tie-ins to the book's story saying it was just an inspiration.\n\nThe game's visual style is reminiscent of the \"StarCraft\" series of games, which are extremely popular in South Korea (where the developer is based).\n\nThe speed and style of \"Huxley\" is fast-paced and team oriented, combining gameplay from twitch shooters such as \"Unreal Tournament\" with the character advancement and large worlds seen in MMORPG's like \"World of Warcraft\". In a recent interview, \"Huxley's\" main producer Kijong Kang said that the cities in \"Huxley\" will be able to accommodate up to 5,000 (according to recent publications that number was increased to 10,000 since summer 2006) people, and the individual battles will support over a hundred players. However, due to major changes in the game's engine and budget, the number of battling players has been reduced to 64 players (32 against 32) at the most. This number may or may not increase once the game is released.\n\nThere are two main types of Player versus Player battles. These are called \"Skirmishes\" and \"Battlefields\". The skirmishes are small battles between two teams of 8 players on small to medium-sized maps. One player acts as the host player and can choose between a variety of settings and gametypes. The other players in the game then connect to the host and are separated into teams based on their character's faction. Battlefields are much larger scale battles with higher stakes and more players. In the \"Open Frontier Test\" of \"Huxley\", this mode supported 64 players, 32 of each faction. Battlefields generally take place on much larger maps, and have objectives that players need to capture, retrieve, gather, or defend. Because hosting 64 players on a player's PC would be incredibly difficult, the Battlefields are hosted by dedicated servers.\n\nIn the Player versus Environment portion of \"Huxley\", players can either play alone or group up with three others to kill AI-controlled monsters and complete quests. All fighting takes place in instance dungeons. There is also a town where players can meet up to talk, trade, shop, and form parties.\n\nIn the early part of the character advancement player system, players can shape their character in the style they like best. After that, players can then add depth to their characters. ‘Experiences’ and ‘Battle points’ are two elements of character advancement. ‘Experiences’ will affect the earlier part of character development and ‘Battle Points’ will affect the later part of a character’s development in a big way.\n\nIn the earlier part, by acquiring licenses, characters can have opportunities to use upgraded weapons and armor. In the later part of the game, players will concentrate on developing their characters to be more effective under any circumstance. One developer has stated, \"We are planning to make the earlier part of character development relatively fast and the later part of development a bit slower but more abundant. This is because we decided that too much difference between characters abilities that affect combat result is not good for an FPS game.\"\n\nWebzen has considered the fact that in most MMOGs the players at earlier levels have no chance of defeating those at the higher levels, and therefore they have adjusted the game to make skill more significant than long periods of playing the game and leveling up. Leveling up will give players advantages, such as more slots for upgrades and perhaps faster aiming, but a lower level player can still measure up to a higher one.\n\n\"Huxley\" includes vehicles for both player-vs-player and player-vs-environment gameplay, as well as general transportation. Gameplay footage has shown several visually interesting SciFi vehicles, including an APC, an aircraft resembling \"Unreal Tournament 2004\"'s Raptor, a large energy based tank, and a small assault buggy. Vehicles are used in both combat and transportation.\n\nDeveloper interviews have also stated that players can obtain motorcycles for personal transportation, and that they will mainly serve as status symbols for wealthy players and as a quicker mean of transportation through town.\n\n\"Huxley\" has nine different types of weapons. Each class specializes in three weapons, and also has the option of using four weapons of the other classes, although with less proficiency.\n\nThere are also several different modifications of each type of weapon. These usually have minor tradeoffs like doing more damage with a lower fire rate, or being more accurate with less damage.\n\nSome special weapon types start to appear for higher level classes. Notable ones of these are a splitting rocket launcher in which the rocket splits into two after a distance and an optical rifle which does a damage over time or slows the enemy. For the Enforcer they get special Flingers which have a longer distance of fire and will either stick to the wall or be able to be bounced off the wall. The Phantom gets Sniper rifles which have a chance to cause a devastating damage over time.\n\nAbilities, or skills, can be used in battle to give a player to a tactical advantage. As a player levels up, they are rewarded with new and more powerful skills. The type of skills available to the player differs based on their class. Skills are used by being \"equipped\" to armour. The number of skills that can be equipped depends on the players level and the rank of the armour. This system is very similar in concept to \"Call of Duty 4\"'s perk system.\n\nThere are two types of skills, active and passive. Passive skills are skills that act as buffs, or skills that activate automatically when a certain condition is met, examples of this include health regeneration, and the ability to drop a flash grenade when low on health. Active skills are activated manually by hitting the assigned key.\n\nIn June 2008, NHN USA announced that it had secured the rights to distribute \"Huxley\" via its ijji portal.\n\nIn August 2010, NHN USA announced that they will be transferring the publishing duties of \"Huxley: The Dystopia\" to developer Webzen.\n\nThe soundtrack for \"Huxley\" was composed by Kevin Riepl. The score was recorded by the 80-piece Hollywood Studio Symphony at Warner Bros in March 2007.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1958969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958969", "title": "Stealth ship", "text": "Stealth ship\n\nA stealth ship is a ship which employs stealth technology construction techniques in an effort to ensure that it is harder to detect by one or more of radar, visual, sonar, and infrared methods.\n\nThese techniques borrow from stealth aircraft technology, although some aspects such as wake and acoustic signature reduction (Acoustic quieting) are unique to stealth ships' design. Though radar cross-section (RCS) reduction is a fairly new concept many other forms of masking a ship have existed for centuries or even millennia.\n\nIn designing a ship with reduced radar signature, the main concerns are radar beams originating near or slightly above the horizon (as seen from the ship) coming from distant patrol aircraft, other ships or sea-skimming anti-ship missiles with active radar seekers. Therefore, the shape of the ship avoids vertical surfaces, which would perfectly reflect any such beams directly back to the emitter. Retro-reflective right angles are eliminated to avoid causing the \"cat's eye\" effect. A stealthy ship shape can be achieved by constructing the hull and superstructure with a series of slightly protruding and retruding surfaces. Furthermore, round shapes on the ship are eliminated or covered up, examples include smokestacks and gun turrets. Also, cavities that present a horizontal face are to be eliminated since they act like a trap and are very visible to radar. To get around these limitations many ships use features such as panels that cover reflective surfaces or use alternate designs of hardware. Also, every effort must be made to have the smallest gaps on the ship as possible. Common hull shapes include tumblehome hull designs which slope inward from the waterline, and SWATHhulls which allow for better stability when using a tumblehome hull. These RCS design principles were developed by several navies independently in the 1980s using work done on aircraft RCS reduction as the starting point.\n\nThe currently developed U.S. \"Zumwalt\"-class destroyer — or DD(X) — is the US version of a stealth ship. Despite being 40% larger than an \"Arleigh Burke\"-class destroyer the radar signature is more akin to a fishing boat, according to a spokesman for Naval Sea Systems Command; sound levels are compared to the s. The tumblehome hull reduces radar return and the composite material deckhouse also has a low radar return. Water sleeting along the sides, along with passive cool air induction in the mack reduces infrared signature. Overall, the destroyer's angular build makes it \"50 times harder to spot on radar than an ordinary destroyer.\n\nThe Swedish Navy's \"Visby class\" corvette is designed to elude visual detection, radar detection, acoustic detection, and infrared detection. The hull material is a sandwich construction comprising a PVC core with a carbon fibre and vinyl laminate. Avoidance of right angles in the design results in a smaller radar signature, reducing the ship's detection range.\n\nBritain's Type 45 anti-air warfare destroyer has similarities to the \"Visby\" class, but is much more conventional, employing traditional steel instead of carbon fiber. Like \"Visby\", its design reduces the use of right angles.\n\nTaiwan's' Tuo Chiang-class stealth corvette are a class of fast stealth multi-mission corvettes currently in service with the Republic of China (Taiwan) Navy. The ships is designed to have a low radar cross-section and evade radar detection making it difficult to detect the ship when operating closer to the coastline \n\n\"Sea Shadow\", which utilizes both tumblehome and SWATH features, was an early U.S. exploration of stealth ship technology.\n\nStealth technology represents more than just a low RCS; noise reduction plays a huge role in naval stealth because sound travels much better in water than air. Some of the techniques used include muffled exhaust systems, modified propeller shapes, and pump-jets. The shape of the hull can also have a great effect on the reduction of the noise from a ship. Another major element is signal emission control. Modern warships emit lots of electromagnetic radiation in the form of radar, radio, and even bleed-off from the ship's electrical systems. All of this can be used to track a ship and thus modern stealth ships often have a mode that switches as much of the electronic emissions off, the downside of course is that the ship then has to rely on passive sensors and can't easily send messages further than line of sight.\n\nAlso of great importance is thermal emissions. A heat signature can make a ship stand out like a candle in a dark ocean making it easier to spot and because it is possible to see infra-red emissions through features that would normally hide a ship such as fog, or a smoke screen, many detection platforms like patrol aircraft, UAV's, and satellites often have the ability to see multiple bands in the infrared spectrum including heat. This necessitates the control of these emissions. The most common way is to mix any hot gasses emitted by the main source of heat which is the engines exhaust with cold air to dilute the signature and make it harder to pick out the ship from the background warmth. Another method vents the exhaust into the water though this increases the ships acoustic signature. For the hull water can be actively distributed across the hull of the ship cooling the ship. Another less crucial but still relevant part of a stealth ship is visual camouflage. This area is probably the oldest form of stealth, with records going back almost as far as the writing of ancient mariners using visual tricks to make their ships harder to spot. Though still relevant this area has taken on lesser importance with the advent of long-range radar.\n\nJust like choices in shaping, the choice of materials affects the RCS of a ship. Composites such as fiberglass and carbon fiber are great blockers of radar and give smaller vessels an advantage in further RCS reductions. However, composites are fragile and often unsuited to larger ships or ships that expect to take fire, though new laminates can partially negate some of the weaknesses. This restricts larger ships to metals such as steel and aluminum alloys. To compensate a ship may include a coating of a radar absorbing material though this can be quite expensive and may not stand up to the corrosive effects of salt water.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is named after Rainer Ludwig Claisen, who first published his work on the reaction in 1887.\nAt least one of the reagents must be enolizable (have an α-proton and be able to undergo deprotonation to form the enolate anion). There are a number of different combinations of enolizable and nonenolizable carbonyl compounds that form a few different types of Claisen.\n\nThe base used must not interfere with the reaction by undergoing nucleophilic substitution or addition with a carbonyl carbon. For this reason, the conjugate sodium alkoxide base of the alcohol formed (e.g. sodium ethoxide if ethanol is formed) is often used, since the alkoxide is regenerated. In mixed Claisen condensations, a non-nucleophilic base such as lithium diisopropylamide, or LDA, may be used, since only one compound is enolizable. LDA is not commonly used in the classic Claisen or Dieckmann condensations due to enolization of the electrophilic ester.\n\nThe alkoxy portion of the ester must be a relatively good leaving group. Methyl and ethyl esters, which yields methoxide and ethoxide, respectively, are commonly used.\n\n\n\n\nIn the first step of the mechanism, an α-proton is removed by a strong base, resulting in the formation of an enolate anion, which is made relatively stable by the delocalization of electrons. Next, the carbonyl carbon of the (other) ester is nucleophilically attacked by the enolate anion. The alkoxy group is then eliminated (resulting in (re)generation of the alkoxide), and the alkoxide removes the newly formed doubly α-proton to form a new, highly resonance-stabilized enolate anion. Aqueous acid (e.g. sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid) is added in the final step to neutralize the enolate and any base still present. The newly formed β-keto ester or β-diketone is then isolated. Note that the reaction requires a stoichiometric amount of base as the removal of the doubly α-proton thermodynamically drives the otherwise endergonic reaction. That is, Claisen condensation does not work with substrates having only one α-hydrogen because of the driving force effect of deprotonation of the β-keto ester in the last step.\nThe Stobbe condensation is a modification specific for the diethyl ester of succinic acid requiring less strong bases. An example is its reaction with benzophenone: \n\nA reaction mechanism that explains the formation of both an ester group and a carboxylic acid group is centered on a lactone intermediate (5):\n\nThe Stobbe condensation was used in the first step of Reinhard Sarges' synthesis of tametraline and it can also be used in the synthesis of dimefadane.\n\n"}

Rachel Brook (now Rachel Coe) of Movietone was a member during the band's early incarnation; other musicians contributing to the group's recordings and live performances included Rocker (ex-the Flatmates), Matt Elliott (aka the Third Eye Foundation) and Sam Jones (of Crescent).\n\nDrawing on sources such as krautrock, folk and dream pop, the group referred to their DIY sound as \"rural psychedelia\" and were associated with bands of the contemporary post-rock and shoegazing scenes. The band was able to create a small but enthusiastic fanbase, and were notable for recording most of their output at home, avoiding recording studios.\n\nPearce had previously been a member of Ha Ha Ha, releasing the \"Up and Down\" EP in 1985. He then formed Rosemary's Children, issuing the 1986 single \"Southern Fields\" and 1987 album \"Kings and Princes\". While at art school in Farnham, he met other Bristol musicians and played through the early 1990s as a member of various groups including the Secret Garden, the Distance and Linda’s Strange Vacation. \n\nFlying Saucer Attack formed in 1992 as a loose collective centered on the core of Pearce and Brook, releasing their debut single, \"Soaring High\", in January 1993 on their own FSA label. Their second single, \"Wish\", followed that June. Both singles were issued as limited edition vinyl 7-inches in handmade packaging.\n\nThe group's first studio album (self-titled, but sometimes called \"Rural Psychedelia\" as those words appeared on the cover) was released in 1993, and included a noisy cover of Suede's contemporary single \"The Drowners\", which provoked press interest in the record. Like the earlier singles, the album was released on FSA's own label by Heartbeat Productions, and was deliberately only made available on vinyl. The album was released in the United States by VHF Records in early 1994, on CD and vinyl – the CD bore the legend \"compact discs are a major cause of the breakdown of society\" (other releases would carry messages such as \"keep vinyl alive\", \"home taping is reinventing music\" and \"less is more\").\n\nThe band then signed to Domino Recording Company. The first release for the new label was \"Distance\" (October 1994), which collected the early singles and some unreleased material. It was released in the US by VHF. A contemporaneous non-album single, \"Land Beyond the Sun\", was Flying Saucer Attack's first release on US label Drag City, who issued it on 25 September 1994, followed by a Domino release the following month.\n\nA second studio album, \"Further\", was released 17 April 1995 by Domino and Drag City. A cover of Wire's \"Outdoor Miner\" was released as a single that year. Another singles compilation followed, \"Chorus\" on 20 November 1995, including a sleeve note stating that \"this album marks the end of FSA phase one\". In 1995, Brook left the band to concentrate on Movietone.\n\nA version of the folk song \"Sally Free and Easy\" was initially only released as a single on CD on 5 November 1996; the sleeve note explained that the pressing plant had been unable to cut it to vinyl (a US plant later achieved the feat by using a monaural master, and it was issued on 12\" by Drag City). Full-length 1996 releases included \"In Search of Spaces\", an album consisting of early 1994 live tracks (mainly unstructured noise, released by Bruce Russell's Corpus Hermeticum imprint), and \"Distant Station\", an album with two long tracks constructed by fellow Domino act Tele:Funken from samples of the band. \n\nThe three-song \"Goodbye\" EP, released 21 January 1997 on VHF Records, was a mix of old and new material; the second track, recorded live in April 1995, featured New Zealand guitarist Roy Montgomery.\n\n\"New Lands\", Flying Saucer Attack's third studio album, was released in October 1997. The band described it as \"phase two\", but it did not depart from the usual mixture of aggressive feedback and noise, and gentle folk-influenced melody. After \"New Lands\" and a final vinyl-only 7\" single, \"Coming Home\", both issued in 1997, Pearce left Domino.\n\nThe \"phase 2\" version of Flying Saucer Attack accepted an invitation to participate in a tribute album to Moby Grape co-founder Skip Spence, who was dying of lung cancer. \"\", featuring their cover of \"Grey - Afro\", was released by Birdman Records on 6 July 1999.\n\nFlying Saucer Attack's fourth studio album, \"Mirror\", was released 17 January 2000 on FSA, effectively marking the end of the group for the next 15 years. Pearce subsequently collaborated with Jessica Bailiff under the name Clear Horizon; the duo released an eponymous album on Kranky in 2003.\n\nThe only new material released by the band during their sabbatical came in 2008, when Flying Saucer Attack participated in a two-disc Fire Records compilation setting all 36 poems from James Joyce's 1907 \"Chamber Music\" poetry collection to music by contemporary alternative acts.\n\nAfter a 15-year hiatus, Flying Saucer Attack released a new album, \"Instrumentals 2015\", on 17 July 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Though a \"penniless shepherd\" in the words of historian Philip Khoury, al-Murshid was afflicted by epilepsy, and in his trances he spoke of the apocalypse and the arrival of the Mahdi. As a result, he acquired a reputation as \"a prophet and miracle worker.\" About 1923, he proclaimed himself as a demi-god, when he used ventriloquy and luminous paint to trick the locals in the Alawite-inhabited Syrian Coastal Mountain Range.\n\nHis emerging power worried both local notable Alawite families and the French authorities, who arranged to have him and some of his followers sent to Raqqa in exile in the mid-1920s. Yet when al-Murshid returned, he managed to patch up his problems with local notables, not least through strategic marriages.\n\nAs he attempted to expand his power beyond the countryside, of Lattakia. With a following of some 40,000 people and extensive wealth built on land holding and tax collection duties, al-Murshid found himself in a position of great power. By the 1930s, he had united the three tribes of the Amamra, Dariusa, and Mheilbe under his control.\n\nIn 1937, he became a member of Parliament, and avoided the separatist approach advocated for by some among Syria's minority groups. Yet once it appeared that the French would not make good on their promise to grant Syria independence in 1936, al-Murshid began to call for separatism again. In 1943 he was elected again as a member of the central Syrian Parliament.\n\nIn 1944, under British instigation, al-Murshid was arrested in Beirut and kept in Damascus under house arrest for a few months.\n\nThe Syrian government tried to charge him with treason and other civil charges, but they could not prove any of the charges. Hence, the Judge received a direct order from the president, Shukri al-Quwatli, to convict Sulayman by any means, and he was executed on 16 December 1946 in Marjeh Square in Damascus.\n\nHis movement deified al-Murshid and, following his death, his sons Mujib and Saji. The followers of al-Murshid later became known as Al-Murshidyah () named after his second son Mujib Al-Murshid, who was killed by Abd Elhak Shihada (), a military police commander, (by direct order from Adib Shishakli) on 27 November 1952. Murshidians were persecuted by the Syrian authorities until President Hafez al-Assad came to power in 1970. Since then, Al-Murshidyah was practiced relatively freely like any other religion. After the 1984 confrontation between Hafez al-Assad and his younger brother Rifaat al-Assad, the Al-Murshid family was allowed to return to the Lattakia region. Murshidyya soldiers in Rifaat's Defense Companies (Saraaya al-Difa'a) had sided with the President in the confrontation.\n\nMurshidians only exist in Syria in which they mostly spread out in Latakia Governorate, Homs Governorate, Al-Ghab Plain and Damascus. Their numbers may vary from 300 to 500 thousand people. They celebrate a festival called \"Joy in God\" for three days, starting from 25 August of each year, this day commemorates the beginning of the new religion by Mujib al-Murshid. In these three days, people make private prayers, dress well and offer desserts as a way of celebration.\n\n"}
{"id": "1959014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1959014", "title": "The Greatest Game Ever Played", "text": "The Greatest Game Ever Played\n\nThe Greatest Game Ever Played is a 2005 American biographical sports film based on the early life of golf champion Francis Ouimet. The film was directed by Bill Paxton, and was his last film as a director. Shia LaBeouf plays the role of Ouimet. The film's screenplay was adapted by Mark Frost from his 2002 book, \"The Greatest Game Ever Played: Harry Vardon, Francis Ouimet, and the Birth of Modern Golf\". It was shot in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, with the Kanawaki Golf Club, in Kahnawake, Quebec, the site of the golf sequences.\n\nSet mainly in 1913, the film is about Francis Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf), the first amateur to win the U.S. Open. Amateur golf in that era was a sport only for the wealthy, and Ouimet came from an immigrant family that was part of the working class. Ouimet watches an exhibition by legendary British golf pro Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) as a 7-year-old boy, and becomes very interested in golf. He begins as a caddie at The Country Club, a posh enclave located across the street from his home in suburban Brookline, Massachusetts, while making friends with the other caddies. He works on his own golf game at every chance, and gradually accumulates his own set of clubs. Francis practices putting at night in his room. He wins the Massachusetts Schoolboy Championship.\n\nOne day, a Club member, Mr. Hastings (Justin Ashforth), asks Ouimet to play with him over The Country Club course, where caddies have almost no access of their own, and he shoots a fine round of 81 despite a 9 on one hole. His talent, composure, and good manners earn admirers and interest. With the help of Mr. Hastings and the Club Caddiemaster, Francis gets a chance to play in an upcoming tournament, the U.S. Amateur, the local qualifying for which is to be held at the very same Country Club course. However, his father Arthur (Elias Koteas) tells his son to quit golf and get a \"real job\". Ouimet needs $50 for the entry fee, and so agrees to get a real job and never play golf again if he could not qualify; his father lends him the money. On the 18th, Francis faces a three-foot putt that would secure him a spot in the championship, but he looks over and his father is watching. Ouimet is distracted, misses and falls one stroke short of qualifying for the championship proper.\n\nWith much jeer from the rich folk, Ouimet, now 20, fulfills his promise to his dad and works at a sporting goods shop, while continuing to live at home. After some time with his golf forgotten, Ouimet is still at the bottom of the working class. But one day, the president of the United States Golf Association enters the store and personally invites him to play in the upcoming U.S. Open. After some maneuvering and consideration from his employer, Ouimet secures entry. His father informs Ouimet that he must find his own place to live after the tournament and Ouimet agrees to this arrangement. However, his mother has been supportive of his golf from the start. She admonishes Ouimet's father for not recognizing Ouimet's talent and that he now has a chance to demonstrate it in an important tournament.\n\nOuimet competes in the 1913 U.S. Open that takes place at The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts, the familiar course located across the street from his home. The favorites are British champions Vardon and Ted Ray (Stephen Marcus), who are accompanied by the snobbish Lord Northcliffe (Peter Firth), and the reigning U.S. Open champion, John McDermott. Northcliffe looks to see that either Vardon or Ray wins the Open, to affirm British dominance over the Americans in golf, and also to prove that only gentlemen were able champions. Ouimet competes with his 10-year old friend, Eddie Lowery (Josh Flitter), who skips school to caddie for Ouimet. After the first two rounds, Vardon and Ray have a seemingly comfortable lead, with McDermott unable to keep up. After some initial struggles, Ouimet rallies back and ends up tying with Vardon and Ray at the end of the fourth round, meaning that the three of them would compete in an 18-hole playoff to determine the champion. The night before, Northcliffe mocks Ouimet's social status to Vardon, who came from humble beginnings himself, and Vardon finally tells Northcliffe that he is going to try to win only for his own pride, not Britain's and that if Ouimet wins, it will be because of his own skill, not his background.\n\nThe playoff round commences, with all three competitors keeping it close until the final holes, where Ray fades out, and Ouimet ahead of Vardon by a stroke going into the final hole. Vardon finishes with a par, giving Ouimet the chance to clinch the win with a par himself. Seeing him become nervous before the final putt, Eddie calms him down, and Ouimet is able to make the putt and win the U.S. Open. As the crowd carries him and Eddie on their shoulders, they start to hand him money. Ouimet refuses it all, only accepting one bill from his now proud father. In the clubhouse, Vardon privately congratulates Ouimet and suggests that they should play a friendly round together in the future. Ouimet and Eddie then walk home, carrying the U.S. Open trophy.\n\nThe movie shows a dramatic finish in the playoff, with Ouimet sinking a putt on the 18th hole to win the Championship by a single stroke. In reality, Ouimet finished birdie-par on 17 and 18 to Vardon's bogey-double bogey to end the playoff five strokes clear of Vardon and six ahead of Ray. The movie also shows the playoff as being in fair weather, and moves the rain to the third round. In the movie the historical 17th hole plays as a \"dog leg right\" when in fact at Brookline Country Club is played as a \"dog leg left\".\n\n\nThe film opened at #9 at the U.S. box office in its opening weekend grossing US$3,657,322.\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews, from golf fans and non fans of the sport alike. Roger Ebert gave it three of four stars, stating it gave the real history of the greatest golf match with a strong human element while showing the golf play in a \"gripping story\". He notes that he is \"not a golf fan but found (it) absorbing all the same... Paxton and his technicians have used every trick in the book to dramatize the flight and destination of the golf balls. We follow balls through the air, we watch them creep toward the green or stray into the rough, we get not only an eagle's-eye view but a club's-eye view and sometimes, I am convinced, a ball's-eye view.\" Larry King proclaimed it \"every bit as good as \"Seabiscuit\".\"\n\nOn the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, 63% of critics gave the film a positive \"fresh\" review. The website concludes, \"Despite all the underdog sports movie conventions, the likable cast and lush production values make \"The Greatest Game Ever Played\" a solid and uplifting tale.\"\n\nThe film has been released on DVD and UMD by Walt Disney Home Entertainment. Special features include two \"making of\" documentaries with cast and crew members, plus a rare 1963 interview with the real Francis Ouimet on WGBH, the Boston public television station, at Brookline, Massachusetts golf course where the 1913 U.S. Open took place. It was released on Blu-ray Disc in 2009, and again as a DVD/Blu-ray combo pack in 2011. It is now available to stream via Disney+ as of 2019.\n\n"}

It is on the border with Tecate, California, United States and is part of the San Diego–Tijuana metropolitan area. There is a small port of entry between the sister cities that serves as an alternative to the bustling ports of entry in Tijuana. As of 2015, the city of Tecate had a population of 72,860 inhabitants, while the metropolitan area has a population of 102,406 inhabitants. The city sits at an elevation of above sea level.\n\nTecate is best known outside of metropolitan San Diego–Tijuana for Tecate beer and being the home of author Daniel Reveles. Tecate beer is one of the most popular beers in Mexico.\n\nTecate was founded on October 12, 1892. It is in a valley and is surrounded by several hills and mountains, the most prominent and famous of them being Kuuchamaa (also spelled Kuchamaa and Cuchama) Mountain. Kuuchamaa Mountain, also known as Tecate Peak in the United States, is a sacred mountain for the Kumeyaay people (known in Mexico as Kumiai) people, and the Kumeyaay language is still spoken in the mountains near Tecate at Juntas de Nejí. Kuuchamaa is rich in greenery, wildflowers and birds. Tecatenses as well as tourists are often seen enjoying hikes and bike rides along its many trails.\n\nIn 1829, the Mexican governor of Alta California José María de Echeandía granted the valley of Tecate as the Rancho Tecate to Juan Bandini. In 1836 the mountain dwelling Kumeyaay with some aid from some former mission neophytes, raided and plundered the rancho. They besieged the ranch house but the men within managed to hold out until it was relieved by a force from San Diego. With his stock and horses stolen and the house burned, Bandini—like owners of other ranchos near San Diego—had to abandon the isolated rancho. Due to the continuing hostilities with the Kumeyaay, Bandini never returned, being compensated with Rancho Jurupa, in 1838.\n\nIn the late 19th century farmers and ranchers arrived in Tecate for the first time since Bandini's failed attempt to settle there. Soon after, they discovered its plentiful natural resources and decided to settle. Its abundant water and fertile soil made Tecate the perfect site for a productive farm market. Olives, grapes and grain became Tecate's staple crops. The industrial sector was developed simultaneously with the creation of coffee processing plants and breweries.\n\nWell known for its traditional infrastructure and looks, Tecate remains true to its origins with its main plaza in the center of the city and its city hall and historic church within walking distance.\n\nTecate's altitude of approximately above sea level and its proximity to the ocean contribute to the temperate climate. It rains enough in the area (almost per year) for a thick ground cover of shrubs and scattered trees to grow. The gradual transition from coastal to desert climate is on the eastern side of the peninsular mountains a few miles east. Although often boulder-strewn, much of the land to the east of the city is taken up with \"ejidos\", or cooperative farms.\n\nTecate is also the name of a small river that courses through the city, and of a hamlet on the Alta California (US side) of the border, affectionately known as \"Tecatito\" (population around 100; ZIP code 91980).\n\nTecate is hot and dry during the summer and cool and sometimes rainy during the winter. It is classified as a hot-summer mediterranean climate.\n\nTecate, which reported a population of 72,860 in the 2015 census, serves as the administrative centre for the Tecate Municipality.\n\nTecate is the site of the first brewery of Tecate Beer. Industrial companies from across the border have their manufacturing affiliates there (e.g., Rockwell Automation, Ingersoll-Rand, Milwaukee Electronics, Automation Controls Group and Oberg Industries).\n\nThe city is served by a couple of hospitals and several clinics, as well as a couple\ndozen doctors and dentists.\n\nTecate is on a spur of Mexican Federal Highway 2 that connects Tijuana with Mexicali via the central Sierra mountains. It is on the older, two-lane, east-west road which is toll-free.\n\nA train from Campo, California, called \"the Tecate Ticket\", travels to Tecate on a monthly basis (currently suspended due to a tunnel fire along the route). The train is run by the Pacific Southwest Railway Museum.\n\nThe city is the location of the Tecate Airport, at Maclovio Herrera, which no longer operates due to low traffic. Instead, Tecate residents are served by nearby Tijuana International Airport (TIJ), with flights to most major Mexican cities. TIJ is closer to Tecate than Mexicali International Airport and thus used more frequently by Tecate residents.\n\nIn May, the annual Tecate-to-Ensenada bicycle race takes place, with thousands of cyclists from both sides of the border participating. July is the time for a two-week celebration in Los Encinos Park, featuring dance groups, crafts, food concessions, and exhibits.\n\nThe pamplonada, or running of the bulls, was ordinarily held in August in the 1980s and early 1990s along one of the main streets, but it was canceled because of a series of accidents and violence.\n\nTecate has a stadium, Manuel Ceceña, which is home to the local baseball team, the Cerveceros (\"Brewers\").\n\nTecate is the site of the Autonomous University of Baja California, Tecate. The school houses a school of engineering.\nTecate has a competition every year for 5th grade students where they share their ideas to change their community in a positive way. The best one competes against the best ones of each city of the state. The winner competes against the other states, and the winner meets the President of Mexico.\n\n"}
{"id": "1959087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1959087", "title": "Power Nine", "text": "Power Nine\n\nIn \"\", Power Nine is a set of nine cards that were only printed early in the game's history, consisting of Black Lotus, Ancestral Recall, Time Walk, Mox Pearl, Mox Sapphire, Mox Jet, Mox Ruby, Mox Emerald, and Timetwister.\n\nThe Power Nine are considered to be among the most powerful cards in the game. All nine cards are of the rarest level of rarity and were printed only in the \"\", \"\", and \"\" sets in late 1993 to early 1994. Currently, all of the Power Nine cards are restricted in the tournament format and banned in , the only tournament formats where they would be legal otherwise, and all except for Timetwister are banned in the format.\n\nThe \"Black Lotus\" card can be played at zero cost, and grants three mana (the game's primary resource) when sacrificed (discarded from play). Thus, the card gives the player an enormous jump in the early stages of a \"Magic\" game. Former Pro player and Magic writer Zvi Mowshowitz has declared Black Lotus as the best card of its type of all time, claiming every deck in the history of the game is better with a Black Lotus in it. It has since been banned from all official tournament formats save for Vintage, but even there, it is limited to one copy per deck, compared to the normal allowance of four. The illustration on Black Lotus was painted by Christopher Rush, who was at the time a Wizards of the Coast employee. The Black Lotus illustration is a depiction of a black lotus flower over a foliage backdrop.\n\nThe reason this powerful card is a flower is attributed to Richard Garfield liking the idea of a lot of power being contained in a flower, a transient object in contrast to more permanent objects like rings or amulets that are often depicted as sources of power in other fantasy settings.\n\nBlack Lotus is usually considered to be the most valuable non-promotional \"Magic\" card ever printed. Its \"\" and \"\" versions in particular are considered to be extremely valuable, due to the more limited print runs and black borders of those sets. The \"Alpha\" version is the most sought-after, with an estimated 1100 ever printed, followed by the \"Beta\" version, with 3300 ever printed. A \"gem mint\" \"Alpha\" version of the Black Lotus was auctioned for more than $166,000 in an eBay auction in 2019.\n\nThe five original Mox cards are: \nThey are colloquially known as \"Moxen\". They are similar to the five Basic Lands (the cards that provide the primary resource to play most cards) in that they cost nothing to play and can add one mana of a specific color to their owner's resource pool. Unlike lands, however, more than one can be played per turn. Like Black Lotus, this can lead to extremely powerful plays much earlier than normal. All five Mox cards were illustrated by Dan Frazier. In each artwork, a different piece of jewelry is depicted. The word \"Mox\" is derived from \"Moxie\", slang for courage, or as Richard Garfield interpreted it energy. However, not all of the people involved with the creation of Magic may have known that fact: when Frazier asked art director Jesper Myrfors what a Mox was, he replied \"Oh, we don’t know!\"\n\nAncestral Recall allows the player to draw three cards at an extremely low cost. It originated as part of a set of five cards known as \"Boons\", one of each color, which gave three of something (e.g. mana, life, damage) for the cost of one mana. Ancestral Recall is the only rare Boon and the only one not to have been reprinted since the Unlimited set.\n\nFor a very low cost, Time Walk allows a player to take an extra turn. In a game that involves a constant build-up of resources over time, a full turn's additional development turned out to be far more powerful than Magic's early designers had imagined. Several cards that grant additional turns have been printed since Time Walk, but always at a much greater cost.\n\nIn Time Walk's early development version, it originally had the text \"Target player loses next turn.\" Richard Garfield tells an anecdote about a playtester telling him that he had a card in his deck that would guarantee he would win the game on the next turn. Garfield could not figure out which card this could be, until the playtester showed him a Time Walk, and pointed out the alternate meaning of the word \"loses\". The wording was changed prior to the release of the game.\n\nWhile the other Power Nine cards are simple in concept, Timetwister is more complex. It forces each player to shuffle their hand, graveyard, and library together and then draw a new hand of seven cards. Because it affects all players, it may not be apparent at first why Timetwister is a powerful card. Its power lies mostly in situations where the player playing it has fewer cards in his or her hand than the opponent, and has established a powerful board position—Timetwister does not affect cards already on the table. The player casting Timetwister can essentially catch up on cards in hand, and potentially get back powerful cards that were discarded, without giving up a dominant board position. Unlike the other cards in the Power Nine, Timetwister therefore requires a deck to be more carefully built in order to exploit its power.\n\nThe Power Nine were not available for the first twelve years of . They first appeared as a part of Cube Drafts, where players do not keep the cards for their collections after the conclusion of the event. In June 2014, Wizards of the Coast officially supported Vintage as a Magic Online sanctioned format, and Vintage Masters, a booster specifically providing essential parts of the Vintage format, including all Power Nine cards, was released for a limited period. The Power Nine cards appeared only in the premium foil slots of Vintage Masters boosters where they could be either foil or non-foil as a special rarity. On average it took 53 packs of Vintage Masters to open one piece of the Power Nine.\n\nThe implementation of the Power Nine cards online is functionally identical to the original cards, but the cards are displayed with updated rules text. The versions originally released online feature different artwork and are displayed with a modern card frame. With exception of the Black Lotus, the illustrations are those that were originally given to the winners of the Vintage Championships as alternate Power Nine artworks. The Black Lotus received a new artwork by Chris Rahn.\n\nIn December 2017 Vintage Masters drafts were reintroduced to Magic Online for a week (beginning 12 December and ending 19 December). In this case players could choose between two types of boosters, the classic Vintage Masters boosters and otherwise identical boosters that included Power Nine with the cards' original arts and borders.\n\nThe Blacker Lotus was a satirical card in the parody \"Unglued\" set which produced four mana, although it required the user to physically tear the card up after use. Jack-in-the-Mox from the same set works like a regular Mox but produces either a random color of mana, or destroys itself, depending on a die roll. Mox Lotus, from the later \"\" parody set, provides infinite mana of any color and immunity to mana-burn (now redundant due to rules changes), but costs fifteen mana to play.\n\nThroughout Magic the Gathering's history, \"revised\" versions of some of the Power Nine have been introduced, ones that have the effects that are the same as or similar to their inspirations, with reduced power levels. Of note are Gilded Lotus from \"Mirrodin\", which is a Black Lotus without the sacrifice clause, costed at 5 mana, and the Mox Amber from \"Dominaria\", which allows its player to gain one mana of any color, provided that the color is one represented by the legendary creatures and planeswalkers the player currently controls.\n\nThe Power Nine are among the very few widely recognized cards never to have received updated artwork from their original printing. As a way to rectify this, since 2003, the winner of the annual Vintage Championship has received a unique, oversized Power Nine card featuring brand-new art. These prize cards are considerably larger than actual cards, and therefore cannot be used in play. The five Mox cards feature artwork that represent the settings of the Magic expansions released in their corresponding years. Their artist, Volkan Baga, has also illustrated two other Mox cards—Mox Opal and the reissued Mox Diamond—in the same style. The following cards have been given to the winners:\n\n\n"}

It is a service of Temple University. The Temple University Board of Trustees holds the station's license. The broadcast tower used by the station is located in the Roxborough section of Philadelphia at ().\n\nWRTI began in 1948 as an AM carrier current station. It was founded by John Roberts, professor emeritus of communications at Temple and long-time anchorman at WFIL-TV (now WPVI-TV). He helped found the School of Communications and Theater at Temple. The call letters stood for \"Radio Training Institute.\" In 1952, the station received an FM transmitter, receiving a full license to cover the FM facility in 1953. After years of serving as a student laboratory, WRTI-AM signed-off for good in 1968. WRTI-FM switched from block programming to an all-jazz format in 1969 after Philadelphia's commercial classical music station, WFLN, changed formats.\n\nWRTI is a music-intensive public radio service, broadcasting classical music during the day, and jazz at night.\n\nThe station features hosts Gregg Whiteside, Kevin Gordon, Bob Perkins, Bob Craig, Maureen Malloy, Bliss Michelson, Joe Patti, I. Robin Booker, Courtney Blue, Ryan Gottlieb, Rich Gunning and Debra Lew Harder. Long-time Jazz host Jeff Duperon died on June 17, 2019. He was 66. \n\nWRTI also has special programs on Friday and Saturday evenings. Each Friday there's \"The Bridge,\" with host J. Michael Harrison. This program explores the merging platforms of popular music and jazz. Saturday night, \"Jukebox Jazz\" features jazz cover pieces of popular music and songs that made the Top-40 charts. \"El Viaje\" hosted by David Ortiz, airs Saturday night and focuses on Latin Jazz, Mambo and Salsa. \n\nWRTI also presents arts and culture programming. The multi-award-winning CrossOver, explores music as \"the international language.\" The show, which presents music and conversation with some of the world's greatest artists and personalities, focuses not only on classical and jazz, but also music in the periphery of those two art forms. Featured have been Michel Legrand, Rick Braun, Byron Janis, Billy Joel, Eric Whitacre, Marvin Hamlisch, Michael Feinstein, Louis Lortie, Herbie Hancock, Yolanda Kondonassis, Branford Marsalis and many more.\n\nThe award-winning Creatively Speaking arts segments feature contributors Jim Cotter, David Patrick Stearns and Susan Lewis among others. Mr. Cotter heads WRTI's Arts and Culture desk. The forerunner of these features was a 30-minute Saturday morning arts magazine show, also called Creatively Speaking, which was cancelled in early 2013. It was felt that splitting up the show in segments and spreading them throughout the broadcast day and week would better serve the audience.\n\nSome of WRTI's programming is centered on area arts organizations. Discoveries From the Fleisher Collection is hosted by Kile Smith, former curator of the Edwin A. Fleisher Collection of Orchestral Music at the Free Library of Philadelphia, the largest lending library of orchestral performance material in the world, and WRTI's Jack Moore.\n\nThe Wanamaker Organ Hour features recordings of performances on the organ by Mr. Conte and various guests.

He played as a defender and spent 15 seasons in England, gaining a total of 315 appearances in the Premier League.\n\nHermann was relegated from the Premier League five times, a record he holds jointly with Nathan Blake. He was relegated with every Premier League club he has played for: Crystal Palace (1997–98 season), Wimbledon (1999–2000), Ipswich Town (2001–02), Charlton Athletic (2006–07), and Portsmouth (2009–10).\n\nIn 1993, Hermann started playing for his local club ÍBV, where he took part in five seasons with the team. He only played 3 matches out of 18 in his first season as the club finished 8th out of 10, but played all the matches in the next two seasons with the club finishing 8th and then 3rd. He then played every match but one in his fourth season as the club finished 4th. He left before the completion of his last season, but the club ended up as champions of Iceland for the second time and for the first time in 18 years, with Hermann playing a big role in the turnaround of the club's fortunes.\n\nIn 1997, Hermann was scouted by Premier League newcomers Crystal Palace. He came into English football in August that year when Palace signed him up. He was one of the team's few stand-out players in a season where Palace were relegated. At Palace, Hermann scored league goals against Sheffield Wednesday and Chelsea, with the latter goal briefly giving Palace the lead at Stamford Bridge. He also scored once in the League Cup against Torquay United.\n\nIn September 1998, Hermann opted to move further down The Football League and followed recently departed Crystal Palace chairman Ron Noades to Brentford, where Noades was now chairman as well as the manager. He joined the London-based Third Division side for a then-club record incoming fee of £750,000.\n\nBrentford were champions of the Third Division and Hermann scored six goals, but in October 1999, he signed for Premier League side Wimbledon in a deal worth £2.5 million, which remained Brentford's record transfer fee received until September 2014. They were later relegated from the top flight that season. During his time at Wimbledon, he scored once against West Ham United.\n\nA£4.5 million move before the 2000–01 season saw him become newly promoted Ipswich Town's record signing. Ipswich finished fifth in the club's first season back in the Premier League, thus securing a UEFA Cup place. The following season, there was a complete reversal of fortunes, and they were relegated. Ipswich trimmed their squad to save on finances, but Hermann turned down a move to newly promoted West Bromwich Albion at the start of the 2002–03 season – reportedly due to West Bromwich offering him vastly reduced wages compared to what he was currently receiving, and also Hermann not wanting to face another relegation battle. At Ipswich he scored league goals against Manchester City and West Ham United and scored once in the UEFA Cup against Helsingborg.\n\nIn March 2003, Hermann moved on from Ipswich, joining Premier League side Charlton Athletic. He signed a three-and-a-half-year contract, with the club paying £800,000, plus a further £100,000 if they were not relegated in the 2003–04 season to Hermann. He was able to move to Charlton outside the Premier League's transfer window as Ipswich were in administration, although he would not be eligible to play for the club for the remainder of that season.\n\nHermann proved his worth for Charlton after making his debut in a 3–0 home defeat at the hands of Manchester City. He would miss only five matches in his debut season, and would be regular starter in subsequent years.\n\nOn 25 May 2007, Hermann exercised a clause in his contract with Charlton which allowed him to leave on a free transfer if they were relegated and signed a two-year deal with fellow Premier League club Portsmouth. On 29 September, Hermann scored his first goal for Portsmouth in a 7–4 Premier League win at home against Reading. He followed that up with another goal the following weekend against Fulham. On 20 April 2008, Hermann was sent off for a professional foul on Darius Vassell at the City of Manchester Stadium against Manchester City, but his season ended well by lifting the FA Cup after a 1–0 victory over Cardiff City at Wembley Stadium.\n\nHermann scored two goals in two matches for the second season running in 2009, when he netted with headers against both Liverpool and Manchester City. In December 2009, he scored the first goal in a 2–0 victory against Burnley. On 27 March 2010, Hermann snapped his achilles tendon in an away match against Tottenham Hotspur and was ruled out for the rest of the season. After the match, Spurs and former Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp commented, \"The game was soured by Hermann's injury. The lads said they heard it pop.\" Due to this injury, Hermann was unable to play in the 2010 FA Cup Final.\n\nAfter Portsmouth were relegated from the Premier League, it became unknown whether Hermann would stay at the club. However, on 8 October, he signed a new one-year contract. For most of the 2010–11 season, Hermann remained on the bench, as manager Steve Cotterill preferred loan signing Carl Dickinson, but in the latter part of the season, he became first-choice ahead of Dickinson and made his 500th league appearance against Barnsley on 19 February 2011. He signed a new one-year contract with Portsmouth on 8 July.\n\nOn 14 January 2012, after a long injury spell and limited playing time, it was announced that Hermann would sign for fellow Championship side Coventry City on a six-month contract. He was injured after only two appearances and could not play for the rest of the season.\n\nHermann was released by Coventry when his contract ran out at the end of the 2011–12 season. Coincidentally, both Coventry City and Portsmouth were relegated from the Championship that season.\n\nOn 4 September 2012 a rumour circulated that Hermann was to offer his services to Portsmouth and play for nothing. The following day, the rumour was confirmed by local newspaper \"The News\". In an online article, manager Michael Appleton stated \"Hermann will come in and train with us towards the end of the week and we will see where he is from a fitness point of view. He tells me he wants to play for nothing but we will assess him. I am certainly not ruling it out. We will see how his fitness is, like we would do with any triallist\". Hermann intended to play in an upcoming League One match against Crawley Town, but due to his appointment as manager of his hometown club ÍBV, he did not play.\n\nHermann made his debut for Iceland in a June 1996 friendly match against Cyprus, coming on as a substitute for Alexander Högnason. He since become a strongly established member of the team, collecting 89 caps and captaining the side in his later years.\n\nHermann reached an agreement with his hometown club ÍBV on 19 September 2012 to become their manager for the 2013 Úrvalsdeild season. He would later sign former English international goalkeeper and Portsmouth teammate David James for the 2013 season. He then spent three years at Fylkir, managing the men's team during the 2015 and 2016 seasons, and the women's team during the 2017 season. In January 2018 he teamed up once again with David James at Kerala Blasters in the Indian Super League as assistant manager, after James' appointment as manager.\n\nOn 22 October 2019 he was appointed assistant to Sol Campbell at Southend United of English League One.\n\nHermann was married to fellow Icelander Ragna Lóa Stefánsdóttir, herself a former football player. They have two daughters, Telma and Ída, in addition to Ragna Lóa's own children, Stefán and Elsa.\n\n(*) Community Shield\n\n(**) Icelandic Super Cup\n\nÍBV\n\nBrentford\n\nPortsmouth\n\nIndividual\n\n"}

Because of shifting sands and water levels, it is often connected to the mainland, and at other times is separated from it. It is home to the Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nDespite its remoteness, Monomoy was home to its own community as early as 1710. A tavern for sailors was opened up in the location of today's Hospital Pond, known then as Wreck Cove.\n\nDuring the early 19th century, a deep natural harbor at Monomoy's inner shore known as the Powder Hole attracted a sizeable fishing settlement. In its prime, Whitewash Village housed about 200 residents, a tavern inn called Monomoit House, and Public School #13, which boasted 16 students at one time. Cod and mackerel brought in to the Monomoy port were dried and packed for markets in Boston and New York City. Lobsters were also plentiful, providing both food and income for the villagers, who peddled them to mainlanders at about two cents apiece.\n\nThe village was abandoned after its harbor was washed away by a hurricane around 1860. It remained uninhabited until 1863 when it was reconstructed and reinhabited until 1876.\n\nA storm in the spring of 1958 carved a wide, shallow channel between Morris Island and Monomoy, separating it from the mainland. The Blizzard of 1978 further divided the island into North Monomoy and South Monomoy. A storm during the winter of 2006-2007 once again reconnected South Monomoy to the mainland, although North Monomoy remains an island. The island was designated a Federal Wildlife Refuge in 1970, serving as an important stop on the migratory routes of 285 species of birds. Since gaining federal protection in 1972, gray seals have become a common sight on Monomoy and nearby Chatham's South Beach island.\n\nMonomoy has no human residents, no electricity, and no paved roads. The only extant reminder of Monomoy's habitation is the Monomoy Point Light, which guided ships from 1828 to 1923. The wooden lightkeeper's quarters, the cast iron light tower, and the brick generator house are alone on the desolate point of the South Island.\n\nIt was taken over by the US government just before World War II. The island was home to the Monomoy Island Gunnery Range until 1944, when the Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge was established.\n\nSince 2013, there has been a surge of Atlantic great white shark sightings off the coast of the islands.

{"id": "1959106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1959106", "title": "The Seven Storey Mountain", "text": "The Seven Storey Mountain\n\nThe Seven Storey Mountain is the 1948 autobiography of Thomas Merton, an American Trappist monk and priest who was a noted author in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Merton finished the book in 1946 at the age of 31, five years after entering Gethsemani Abbey near Bardstown, Kentucky. The title refers to the mountain of purgatory from Dante's \"Purgatorio\".\n\n\"The Seven Storey Mountain\" was published in 1948 and was unexpectedly successful. The first printing was planned for 7,500 copies, but pre-publication sales exceeded 20,000. By May 1949, 100,000 copies were in print and, according to \"Time\" magazine, it was among the best-selling non-fiction books in the country for the year 1949. The original hardcover edition eventually sold over 600,000 copies, and paperback sales exceed three million by 1984. A British edition, edited by Evelyn Waugh, was titled Elected Silence. The book has remained continuously in print, and has been translated into more than 15 languages. The 50th-anniversary edition, published in 1998 by Harvest Books, included an introduction by Merton's editor, Robert Giroux, and a note by biographer and Thomas Merton Society founder William Shannon.\n\nApart from being on the \"National Review\" list of the 100 best non-fiction books of the century, it was also mentioned in \"100 Christian Books That Changed the Century\" (2000) by William J. Petersen.\n\nIn \"The Seven Storey Mountain\", Merton reflects on his early life and on the quest for faith in God that led to his conversion to Roman Catholicism at age 23. Upon his conversion, Merton left a promising literary career, resigned his position as a teacher of English literature at St. Bonaventure's College in Olean, New York, and entered the Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani in rural Kentucky. Describing his entry, Merton writes, \"Brother Matthew locked the gate behind me, and I was enclosed in the four walls of my new freedom.\" Later, Dom Frederic Dunne, the abbot at the abbey, who had received him as a novice, suggested that Merton write out his life story, which he reluctantly began, but once he did, it started \"pouring out\". Soon he was filling up his journals with the work that led to the book which \"Time\" magazine later described as having \"redefined the image of monasticism and made the concept of saintliness accessible to moderns\".\n\nIn Merton's journals, the first entry mentioning the project is dated March 1, 1946, but many scholars think he started writing it earlier than that, because the draft (more than 600 pages) reached his agent Naomi Burton Stone by October 21, 1946.\n\nIn late 1946, the partly approved text of \"The Seven Storey Mountain\" was sent to Naomi Burton, his agent at Curtis Brown literary agency, who then forwarded it to the renowned book editor Robert Giroux at Harcourt Brace publishers. Giroux read it overnight, and the next day phoned Naomi with an offer, who accepted it on the monastery's behalf. With Merton having taken a vow of poverty, all the royalties were to go to the Abbey community. Soon a trouble arose, though, when an elderly censor from another abbey objected to Merton's colloquial prose style, which he found inappropriate for a monk. Merton appealed (in French) to the Abbot General in France, who concluded that an author's style was a personal matter, and subsequently the local censor also reversed his opinion, paving the way for the book's publication.\n\nEdward Rice, a friend of Merton, suggests a different story behind the censorship issues. Rice believes the censor's comments did have an effect on the book. The censors were not primarily concerned with Merton's prose style, but rather the content of his thoughts in the autobiography. It was \"too frank\" for the public to handle. What was published was a \"castrated\" version of the original manuscript. At the time Rice published his opinion, he was unable to provide any proof; however, since then early drafts of the autobiography have surfaced and prove that parts of the manuscript were either deleted or changed. In the introduction to the 50th-anniversary edition of the autobiography, Giroux acknowledges these changes and provides the original first paragraph of Merton's autobiography. Originally, it began \"When a man is conceived, when a human nature comes into being as an individual, concrete, subsisting thing, a life, a person, then God's image is minted into the world. A free, vital, self-moving entity, a spirit informing flesh, a complex of energies ready to be set into fruitful motion begins to flame with love, without which no spirit can exist...\" The published autobiography begins with \"On the last day of January 1915, under the sign of the Water Bearer, in a year of a great war, and down in the shadow of some French Mountains on the borders of Spain, I came into the world.\"\n\nIn the middle of 1948, advance proofs were sent to Evelyn Waugh, Clare Boothe Luce, Graham Greene and Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, who responded with compliments and quotations which were used on the book jacket and in some advertisements. The first printing run was increased from 5,000 to 12,500. Thus the book was out in October 1948, and by December it had sold 31,028 copies and was declared a bestseller by \"Time\" magazine. \"The New York Times\", however, initially refused to put it on the weekly Best Sellers list, on the grounds that it was \"a religious book\". In response, Harcourt Brace placed a large advertisement in \"The New York Times\" calling attention to the newspaper's decision. The following week, \"The Seven Storey Mountain\" appeared on the bestsellers list, where it remained for almost a year.\n\nIn \"The Seven Storey Mountain\", Merton seems to be struggling to answer a spiritual call; the worldly influences of his earlier years have been compared with the story of Augustine of Hippo's conversion as described in his \"Confessions\". Many of Merton's early reviewers made explicit comparisons. For example, Fulton J. Sheen called it \"a twentieth-century form of \"The Confessions of St. Augustine\"\".\n\n\"The Seven Storey Mountain\" is said to have resonated within a society longing for renewed personal meaning and direction in the aftermath of a long and bloody war (World War II), at a time when global annihilation was increasingly imaginable due to the development of atomic bombs and even more powerful thermonuclear weapons. The book has served as a powerful recruitment tool for the priestly life in general, and for the monastic orders in particular. In the 1950s, Gethsemani Abbey and the other Trappist monasteries experienced a surge in young men presenting themselves for the cenobitic life. It is a well-known bit of Catholic lore that, after the book's publication, many priests entered monasteries or seminaries with a copy in their suitcase.\n\nOne printing bears this accolade on the cover, from Graham Greene: \"It is a rare pleasure to read an autobiography with a pattern and meaning valid for us all. \"The Seven Storey Mountain\" is a book one reads with a pencil so as to make it one's own.\" Evelyn Waugh also greatly (although not uncritically) admired the book and its author. He admired the book so much, he edited the autobiography for a British audience and published it as \"Elected Silence\".\n\n\"The Seven Storey Mountain\" has been credited as being the first major Catholic book to achieve widespread popularity in America, breaking the liberal Protestant monopoly on middlebrow spirituality and helping to spread the notion of the \"Judeo-Christian tradition\". \n\nLater in life, Merton's perspectives on his work in \"The Seven Storey Mountain\" had changed. In \"The Sign of Jonas\", published in 1953, Merton says that \"\"The Seven Storey Mountain\" is the work of a man I have never even heard of.\" Merton also penned an introduction to a 1966 Japanese edition of \"The Seven Storey Mountain\", saying \"Perhaps if I were to attempt this book today, it would be written differently. Who knows? But it was written when I was still quite young, and that is the way it remains. The story no longer belongs to me...\"\n\nMerton died in 1968 of accidental electrocution while attending an international monasticism conference in Bangkok, Thailand. Various writers have noted the irony of his life's tragic conclusion, given that \"The Seven Storey Mountain\" closes by admonishing the reader to \"learn to know the Christ of the burnt men\" (see, e.g., \"The Man in the Sycamore Tree\", 1979). \"The Seven Storey Mountain\" propelled Merton into a life of paradoxes: a man who left an urban intellectual career for a labor-oriented rural existence, only to be led back into the realm of international opinion and debate; a man who spurned the literary world for the anonymity of cenobitic life in a Trappist monastery, only to become a world-famous author; and a man who professed his devotion to remain fixed in the confines of a monastic cell, only to fulfill an urge to travel throughout Asia.\n\n\"The Seven Storey Mountain\" has been extensively praised in lists of the best books of the 20th century. The Intercollegiate Studies Institute has it on their list of the 50 best books of the century and it was at Number 75 on the \"National Review\"s list of the 100 best non-fiction books of the century.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his roles in the sitcom \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\" from 1952 to 1957 and the sitcom \"Hazel\" from 1961 to 1965, the former of which earned him a Primetime Emmy Award nomination.\n\nDeFore was one of seven children born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to Joseph Ervin, a railroad engineer who worked at the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and was also a local politician, and Albina Sylvia DeFore (née Nezerka). Albina, who occasionally directed plays at their local church, was the daughter of Czech immigrants from the former . Her father Jan Nežerka (1846-1928) was born in Písková Lhota (baptized Catholic in Kostelní Lhota) and her mother Marie Najbrtová (1852-1930) was born in (baptized Evangelical in Hořátev).\n\nAfter graduating from Washington High School in Cedar Rapids, DeFore attended the University of Iowa. He initially studied law while also playing basketball, track, and baseball before becoming interested in acting. Since acting was not a major study at the university, he left and enrolled at the Pasadena Community Playhouse, where he won a scholarship and stayed for three years.\n\nDuring this time, he and four fellow students wrote a play called \"Where Do We Go From Here?\" It was presented in a little theater in Hollywood with DeFore in the cast. As a young man, DeFore toured the country in stock companies for several years before making his Broadway debut in \"Where Do We Go From Here?\" in 1938, when Oscar Hammerstein II offered to take it to Broadway, and DeFore and five of the original cast members went along. The show ran for four weeks, and DeFore was soon recognized as a member of legitimate theater. He remained in New York and won a key role in \"The Male Animal\", which ran for almost eight months on Broadway and eight months on the road.\n\nIn Hollywood, DeFore's first screen appearance was in a bit part in 1936's \"Reunion\". By the early 1940s, he was appearing regularly in films such as: \"The Male Animal\" (1942), \"A Guy Named Joe\" (1943), \"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\" (1944), \"You Came Along\" (1945), \"Without Reservations\" (1946), \"It Happened on Fifth Avenue\" (1947), \"Romance on the High Seas\" (1948), \"My Friend Irma\" (1949) and \"Jumping Jacks\" (1952). In 1946, exhibitors voted him the fourth-most promising \"star of tomorrow\".\n\nDeFore also worked in radio, performing on such programs as \"Suspense,\" \"Old Gold Comedy Theater,\" and \"Lux Radio Theatre\", but he is best known for his work in television. Beginning in 1952, DeFore had a recurring role as the Nelsons' friendly neighbor, \"Thorny\", on the ABC sitcom \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\", earning a nomination in 1955 for a Best Supporting Actor in a Regular Series Primetime Emmy Award. In time though, the role of Thorny was superseded by Lyle Talbot as Joe Randolph, and Mary Jane Croft as his wife Clara.\n\nFrom 1954 to 1955, he served as president of the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences. He was instrumental in arranging for the Emmy Awards to be broadcast on national television for the first time on March 7, 1955. He also served on the board of the Screen Actors Guild.\n\nFrom 1961 to 1965, DeFore was a co-star of the television series \"Hazel\" as \"Mr. B.\" (George Baxter), employer of the spirited, domineering housekeeper Hazel Burke, played by Shirley Booth and based on the cartoon character appearing in \"The Saturday Evening Post\". DeFore was not the original actor to portray George Baxter. In the pilot episode, the role was played by character actor Edward Andrews. DeFore took over the role when the series was green-lighted. The series ran on prime time until 1966 when it was canceled by NBC. DeFore and his co-star Whitney Blake were written out of the series when CBS picked up the series for its final season.\n\nIn 1970 DeFore appeared as Mayor Evans on the TV western \"The Men From Shiloh\" in the episode titled \"Colonial Mackenzie Versus The West.\" In that role he played a murderer, which was a major shift from the comedy roles he was better known for on sitcoms like \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\" and \"Hazel\". Men From Shiloh was a rebranded name for \"The Virginian\". \nFor his contribution to the television industry, Don DeFore has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 6804 Hollywood Blvd.\n\nIn 1965, DeFore and his daughter Penny wrote \"With All My Love\", a book detailing Penny's experiences working in a Korean orphanage. DeFore later released his memoirs, \"Hollywood DeFore and After\".\n\nDeFore married singer Marion Holmes (January 21, 1918 - November 17, 2011) on February 14, 1942. Judy Garland served as Holmes' matron of honor. Holmes performed with the Henry Busse Orchestra from 1935 to 1939, and later with Art Kassel and his \"Castles in the Air\" from 1939 until their marriage. They had five children: Penny, David, Dawn, Ron, and Autumn. They remained married until DeFore's death in 1993.\n\nDeFore and his family were longtime residents of the Mandeville Canyon section of Brentwood and attended the Village Church of Westwood Lutheran. DeFore served as Brentwood's honorary Mayor and also served as a member of the advisory committee for the California Department of Rehabilitation. DeFore was also a 33rd degree Freemason.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1962, DeFore and his family operated the Silver Banjo Barbecue, a restaurant located in Frontierland of Disneyland Park in Anaheim, California. In July 1969, DeFore served as the American delegate at the Moscow International Film Festival.\n\nA long-time Republican, DeFore was a delegate at the 1980 Republican National Convention. His friend, former actor and 40th President of the United States Ronald Reagan, appointed him to the Presidential Advisory Council to the Peace Corps.\n\nOn December 22, 1993, DeFore died of cardiac arrest at Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California. He is interred at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.\n\n"}

{"id": "1959129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1959129", "title": "Composite Superman", "text": "Composite Superman\n\nThe Composite Superman is a DC Comics supervillain, an enemy of Superman and Batman. The character first appeared in \"World's Finest Comics\" #142 (June 1964) and was created by Edmond Hamilton and Curt Swan.\n\nJoseph Meach was a diver who had fallen on hard times. In an attempt to draw publicity to himself, Meach set up a water tank on a sidewalk in Metropolis and dove off a building. Unbeknownst to Meach, the tank was leaking and Meach would have died if not for the intervention of Superman. Upon learning of Meach's misfortunes, Superman obtained a job for him at the Superman Museum where Meach was employed as a janitor. Meach's bitterness did not subside and being surrounded by mementos of Superman's career directed his anger towards Superman. One night as Meach was sweeping in front of a series of statuettes depicting the Legion of Super-Heroes, a bolt of lightning struck the display. The statuettes (which were actually miniature lifeless duplicates of the Legionnaires) unleashed an energy blast that struck Meach, endowing him with the combined powers of the Legion members. Determined to defeat Superman, Batman, and Robin, Meach used his shape-shifting power to turn his skin green and form a costume that was half of Superman's costume and half of Batman's costume. Calling himself the Composite Superman, Meach left a message in both heroes' bases to meet him on a mountain. There, he told the heroes that if he was not allowed to join their team, he would expose their secret identities, which he learned via telepathy. The Composite Superman then created situations for Superman or Batman to handle, but which he intentionally sabotaged to humiliate the heroes, then sorted them out himself. Superman and Batman's attempt to expose him by using robot duplicates failed due to Composite Superman's ability to read their minds. Just before Meach could reveal the heroes' secret identities, the powers he gained from the statues faded away. Meach tried to write down the secret of his powers in the Superman Museum, but his memory faded before he could finish (though he managed to write down about the lightning striking the statues, but nothing more).\n\nA few years later an alien villain named Xan came to Earth to avenge his dead father, a criminal who had been imprisoned by Superman and Batman. Xan restored Joseph Meach's powers by recreating the original accident. Meach's memories returned and he used the powers of Sun Boy and Lightning Lad to destroy the statues of Superman and Batman leading to investigation by the Duo. This time, the duo were able to deduce their enemy's identity as they checked the museum employees who were not around when the Composite Superman was sighted. The Composite Superman captured Superman and Batman by impersonating a chained Robin. The Composite Superman tried to kill the team by using his powers to simultaneously turn half of their bodies to anti-matter; Meach's powers wore off before he could accomplish this. Xan appeared and fired a lethal energy blast at the heroes with his Magna-Gun. A remorseful Meach intercepted the blast, dying instantly. A statue was made to honor Joseph Meach saying that he \"lived a villain, but died a hero.\"\n\nXan escaped from prison and traveled back in time to recreate the event that endowed Joseph Meach with his powers, but with himself obtaining the powers. Xan assumed the identity of the Composite Superman and displayed greater control over his powers and understanding over his weaknesses such as timing his needed restorations of energy to maintain his power. Xan discarded the Composite Superman identity and created an original costume with the new name Amalgamax. Superman traveled to the 30th century to ask the Legion of Super-Heroes for assistance. Superman, Batman, and the Legion defeated Amalgamax by making him believe that the disease that killed his father had developed in him and that his excessive power was causing the disease to develop rapidly.\n\nComposite Superman's origin was reimagined as an early attempt of Professor Ivo's to duplicate the Justice League's powers by creating clones of the Justice League. It was only ever referred to as \"Composite\". Believing it to be a failure, Professor Ivo buried his creature in a field. The clones later revived themselves, merged into one being, and stole Superman and Batman outfits from a store sewing half of each together. Acting as both Superman/Batman and their alter egos of Clark Kent/Bruce Wayne, the Composite creature kidnapped Lois Lane and Tim Drake in an attempt to live the lives of both of its counterparts. He was later attacking Metallo when Batman and Superman arrived, but the duo could not defeat him and he escaped. They tracked him down and told him if he wanted to be both of them then go ahead. They told him of many crimes taking place and he could not decide whom to help first. Composite became unstable and ripped himself apart before they could help him.\n\nFollowing the \"Zero Hour\" reboot of Legion history, Composite Superman was removed from continuity. \"Legion of Super-Heroes\" Vol 4, #68 introduced a new \"Composite Man\", a Durlan who had the ability to duplicate any Legionnaire's powers and appearance. Rather than the clean, split-down-the-middle appearance of Composite Superman, Composite Man had a shifting mixture of costume elements from all the Legion members. Both he and his sister had been given these abilities by the Durlan government to be weapons, and resented this. However, while she chose to make her own destiny, he joined the Dark Circle to gain revenge on Durla.\n\nOn the planet Durla, there was a long cultural struggle between secular and religious movements. Before the formation of the United Planets, the Secularists of Durla created a program to produce living weapons through mutation. The goal was to acquire soldiers capable of not only mimicking the appearance but also the function of any species.\n\nWhen they lost their grip on power, the Secularists found their program deemed sinful by the theocratic government and the test subjects were imprisoned in crystals. During regular maintenance to keep the living weapons contained, one of the crystals is damaged and an unnamed Durlan mutant breaks free, killing the entire priest class of Durla. The living weapon goes in search of Durlan priest and Legionnaire Reep Daggle. When battling the Legion of Super-Heroes the living weapon not only imitates the Legionnaires' abilities, but also parts of their respective appearances. Composite Man meets his end when Saturn Girl uses her telepathy to shut down his mind, leaving him in a catatonic state.\n\nIn terms of abilities and raw power, the Joseph Meach version of Composite Superman was one of the most powerful enemies Superman and Batman ever faced. He had all of Superman's powers, as well as those of Supergirl and the similarly-powered Mon-El and Ultra Boy. The Composite Superman also possessed numerous special powers, derived from various Legion members:\n\n\nProfessor Ivo's version of the character was shown to possess the powers of Superman, Batman, Atom, Elongated Man, Firestorm and Red Tornado.\n\nIn \"Impulse\" #56, Crayd'l, a nanotech computer belonging to Bart Allen's archenemy Inertia, accesses Young Justice's files and uses information on Robin and Superboy to become a \"Composite Superboy\", with the half-and-half, green-skinned appearance of the original. Crayd'l intended to access information on the other members of Young Justice, but Impulse tricked him into downloading a music CD instead, turning him into Superboy's favourite rap artist.\n\nIn \"Superman/Batman\" #6, Hiro Okamura creates a spaceship in the form of a mecha version of the Composite Superman. In a more recent arc in \"Superman/Batman\", a new Composite Superman Batman was created when Mister Mxyzptlk merged the Supermen and Batmen of several alternate realities together. Startled to be joined together, Batman mentally exclaimed to Superman, \"Clark, your mind races, I never knew\"; Superman replies, \"And yours Bruce, is so dark\". This ends at the battle's conclusion, and all the Batmen and Supermen who did not \"need to be here\" were sent away, leaving only the normal DCU Superman and Batman.\n\nIn \"\" (2000), Mister Mxyzptlk join Superman and Batman in a black and white \"comic strip\".\n\nComposite Superman made a cameo in \"Justice League Unlimited\" in an episode called \"The Greatest Story Never Told\". Unlike the comic, this \"Composite Superman\" is the product of a battle with the dark lord Mordru. It's actually a fusion of Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman with the appearance of Composite Superman, but with Wonder Woman's voice, resulting from some twisted spell used in the intense magical conflict. The spell was undone by the time Mordru was defeated.\n\nIn the animated film \"\", the Japanese Toyman built a Mecha/ship to destroy the incoming kryptonite meteor. The ship's design (as in the comic) bears a striking resemblance to Composite Superman.\n\nComposite Superman appears as a playable character in \"\", voiced by Travis Willingham.\n\nDC Direct released a Composite Superman action figure in 2005, and a second one (based on the \"Superman/Batman vengeance 5\" version) in 2008.\n\n\n\n"}

The town is known for the picturesque Tudor-style Hluboká Castle, that is open to the public. The Townshend International School has been based in the town since 1992.\n\nSettled since the Bronze Age, the area was the site of medieval \"Froburg\" Castle, built high above the Vltava river. Once a possession of the Přemyslid king Ottokar II of Bohemia, it later passed to the Vítkovci dynasty.

{"id": "1959173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1959173", "title": "Hosta", "text": "Hosta\n\nHosta (, syn. \"Funkia\") is a genus of plants commonly known as hostas, plantain lilies and occasionally by the Japanese name giboshi. Hostas are widely cultivated as shade-tolerant foliage plants. The genus is currently placed in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Agavoideae, and is native to northeast Asia (China, Japan, Korea, and the Russian Far East). Like many \"lilioid monocots\", the genus was once classified in the Liliaceae. The genus was named by Austrian botanist Leopold Trattinnick in 1812, in honor of the Austrian botanist Nicholas Thomas Host. In 1817, the generic name \"Funkia\" was used by German botanist Kurt Sprengel in honor of Heinrich Funk, a collector of ferns and alpines; this was later used as a common name and can be found in some older literature.\n\nHostas are herbaceous perennial plants, growing from rhizomes or stolons, with broad lanceolate or ovate leaves varying widely in size by species from 1–18 in (3–45 cm) long and 0.75–12 in (2–30 cm) broad. The smallest varieties are called miniatures. Variation among the numerous cultivars is even greater, with clumps ranging from less than four in (10 cm) across and three in (8 cm) high to more than six ft (200 cm) across and four ft (130 cm) high. Leaf color in wild species is typically green, although some species (e.g., \"H. sieboldiana\") are known for a glaucous waxy leaf coating that gives a blue appearance to the leaf. Some species have a glaucous white coating covering the underside of the leaves. Natural mutations of native species are known with yellow-green (\"gold\") colored leaves or with leaf variegation (either white/cream or yellowish edges or centers). Variegated plants very often give rise to sports that are the result of the reshuffling of cell layers during bud formation, producing foliage with mixed pigment sections. In seedlings variegation is generally maternally derived by chloroplast transfer and is not a genetically inheritable trait.\n\nThe flowers of hosta are produced on upright scapes that are woody and remain on the plant throughout winter, they are generally taller than the leaf mound, and end in terminal racemes. The individual flowers are usually pendulous, 0.75–2 in (2–5 cm) long, with six tepals, white, lavender, or violet in color and usually scentless. The only strongly fragrant species is \"Hosta plantaginea\", which has white flowers up to four in (10 cm) long; it is also unusual in that the flowers open in the evening and close by morning. This species blooms in late summer and is sometimes known as \"August Lily\".\n\nTaxonomists differ on the number of \"Hosta\" species; there may be as many as 45. Accordingly, the list of species given here may be taken loosely. The genus may be broadly divided into three subgenera. Interspecific hybridization occurs since all the species have the same chromosome number (2n = 2x = 60); except \"H. ventricosa\" which is a natural tetraploid that sets seed through apomixis. Many cultivated hostas formerly described as species have been reduced to cultivars; these often have their names conserved, and retain Latinized names which resemble species names (e.g., \"Hosta\" 'Fortunei').\n\nAccepted species as of October 2014:\n\n\nHostas are widely cultivated, being particularly useful in the garden as shade-tolerant plants whose striking foliage provides a focal point. The plants are long-lived perennials that are winter hardy in USDA Zones 3 to 8 and recommended for heat zones 8 to 1. Though \"Hosta plantaginea\" originates in China, most of the species that provide the modern plants were introduced from Japan to Europe by Philipp Franz von Siebold in the mid-19th century originating from shady locations with more moisture than they are generally cultivated. Newer species have been discovered on the Korean peninsula as well. Hybridization within and among species and cultivars has produced numerous cultivars, with over 6,100 registered and named varieties, and perhaps as many more that are not yet registered with the American Hosta Society. Cultivars with golden- or white-variegated leaves are especially prized. Popular cultivars include 'Francee' (green leaves with white edges), 'Gold Standard' (yellow leaves with green edges, discovered by Pauline Banyai) 'Undulata' (green leaves with white centers), 'June' (blue-green leaves with creamy centers), and 'Sum and Substance' (a huge plant with chartreuse-yellow leaves). Newer, fragrant cultivars such as 'Guacamole' are also popular.\n\nThe American Hosta Society and the British \"Hosta\" and \"Hemerocallis\" Society support Hosta Display Gardens, often within botanical gardens. Hostas are frequently exhibited at major shows such as the Chelsea Flower Show.\n\nThe following is a list of cultivars that have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\nWhile usually grown for ornamental purposes in the United States, all species of hosta are edible, and are commonly grown as vegetables in some Asian cultures.\n\nHowever, hostas are toxic to dogs, cats, and horses due to the saponins contained in the plant. Symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea.\n\nHosta leaves and stems are eaten by deer, rabbits, slugs and snails, and the roots and rhizomes are eaten by voles, all of these can cause extensive damage to collections in gardens. Some varieties seem more resistant to slug damage, which is more prevalent later in the growing season, than others. Insect pests include Vine weevils and cutworms.\n\nFoliar nematodes, which leave streaks of dead tissue between veins, have become an increasing problem where pesticide use has decreased.\n\nA potexvirus called 'Hosta Virus X' was first identified in Minnesota, USA in 1996. Plants that are infected are destroyed to prevent its spread as the disease can be transmitted from plant to plant by contaminated sap. Symptoms include dark green \"ink bleed\" marks in the veins of yellow-colored leaves, and/or tissue collapse between veins. It can take years for symptoms to show, so symptomless plants in infected batches should also be considered infected.\n\n"}
{"id": "1959174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1959174", "title": "Age of Reptiles (comics)", "text": "Age of Reptiles (comics)\n\nAge of Reptiles is a series of comics published by Dark Horse Comics, created by Ricardo Delgado, a film and comic book artist who has worked on such films as \"The Incredibles\", \"Men in Black\" and \"Apollo 13\".\n\nThe series originally consisted of two comics, which are set in the Mesozoic era: \"Tribal Warfare\", from 1993, and \"The Hunt\", from 1997. Both are very violent stories about the daily lives of carnivorous dinosaurs. A third series, \"The Journey\", began November 2009, with a fourth, \"Ancient Egyptians\", debuting June 2015. \"Tribal Warfare\", \"The Hunt\", and \"The Journey\" have been collected in \"Age of Reptiles Omnibus, Volume 1\".\n\n\"The Hunt\" has received Eisner awards for Talent Deserving of Wider Recognition and Best Limited Series.\n\nA pack of \"Deinonychus\" get revenge on Blue Back, a \"Tyrannosaurus\" who stole their well-earned meal, by stealing all of his family's eggs but one.\n\nA group of four Deinonychus successfully stalk and kill a small sauropod out on the savannah. However, they are soon chased off their kill by the Tyrannosaur Blue Back, who kills one of the Deinonychus in the process. The pack retreats back to their lair and family group, as does Blue Back. One of Blue Back’s young tries to hunt an early mammal but is unable to catch it. \n\nThat night the nest is raided by a pair of Deinonychus, who successfully carry off(and presumably eat) or break the eggs. Blue Back pursues them, but they manage to escape by leaping across a gorge. The chapter ends with Blue Back roaring his grief to the sky. \n\nThe second chapter begins with another Tyrannosaur hunting down and killing a hadrosaur. It then cuts to the trio of Deinonychus going out on another hunting patrol. At the side of a river one of the Deinonychus spots a primitive fish(similar to a mudskipper) wriggling its way along the bank to try and get back into the water. The hungry predator prepares to make a meal out of the fish, only to be ambushed and devoured itself by a massive crocodile that had been lurking nearby. The remaining two Deinonychus continue on, avoiding a hunting Tyrannnosaur in the process. The Tyrannosaur prepares to attack a herd of Triceratops, but loses the element of surprise and in face of a prepared enemy withdraws. \n\nThe two Deinonychus return to their lair only to find that Blue Back has tracked them back to it and slaughtered four of their number; he escapes the same way they had, by leaping across a gorge, and leaves the Deinonychus in the same position he had been. \n\nChapter Three sees a group of Deinonychus attack an Ankyosaur; however, the herbivore drives them off by bashing one of their number with its tail club. The Tyrannosaurs, seeing that there is only one intact egg left, become determined not to fall victim to egg thieves again. The three Deinonychus, meanwhile, stumble upon a nest full of turtle eggs high in the cliffs above a sea and feast upon them. As they try to leave, however, they are ambushed by the Tyrannosaurs; one of the Deinonychus is knocked over the cliff into the sea, where it is devoured by a large Ichthyosaur. The other two are likewise knocked over the cliff as well, but onto dry land; one of them is killed in the fall, but the other one survives. \n\nThe Tyrannosaurs begin to teach the juvenile how to hunt, stalking a stegosaur. However, a Deinonychus lures the juvenile away from the safety of its parent and into an ambush, where it is attacked by a large pack of Deinonychus. The adult tyrannosaur, realizing the danger too late, tries to track the juvenile down, only to find it dead, the leg of a dead Deinonychus still clamped firmly in its jaws. \n\nChapter Four sees a pack of Deinonychus stalking an old and dying sauropod; when it collapses, and dies, they move into to try and begin feasting, only to be confronted by a large group of other predators, including a Carnotaurus and an Oviraptor. The Deinonychus pack is split, as one of the raptors wants to fight the other group while the other insists on retreat. This leads to a battle for leadership. The surviving raptors return to their lair in the middle of a rainstorm, only to find the Tyrannosaurs waiting; the larger predators attack, and a massive battle ensues. The fighting causes the cliffside the raptor’s lair is perched on to collapse, sending all of the animals plunging into the gorge. A single Tyrannosaur manages to survive the fall and returns back to its own lair, only to find that the early mammal the juvenile Tyrannosaur had tried to hunt earlier had eaten the last remaining egg...with the story ending there. \n\nThe story can best be described as a sort of \"gang-war\" between the two species, and while many of the animals depicted in Delgado's story did not exist at the same time period or place, their inclusion was added for familiarity and dramatic effect.\n\nAfter a mother \"Allosaurus\" is killed by a pack of \"Ceratosaurus\", they begin to chase her son. Eventually, the son grows up and takes his revenge.\n\nThe story begins with a young Allosaurus catching a lizard. The Allosaurus and his mother have a den located underneath an overhanging rock outcropping. However, they are soon attacked by a pack of Ceratosaurus; the young Allosaurus flees as its mother takes on, but is ultimately overwhelmed and killed by, the rival carnivores. Months go by, and the young Allosaurus is older, now a juvenile, but is still being hunted by the Ceratosaurus pack. The Allosaurus is chased all the way back to the scene of its mother’s death, where he lures the Ceratosaurus pack under the outcropping. The outcropping collapses, seeming to bury all five of the pursuing predators under the rubble. However, they turn out only to be delayed by the rockslide. \n\nThe pack of Ceratosaurus goes looking for food come across the remains of a dead sauropod. As they begin to feed the young Allosaurus, which had eaten his way inside the carcass and taken shelter there, flees the scene. Exhausted after fleeing, the Allosaurus lays down to rest near a grouping of boulders and rocks, seemingly on the verge of death. A group of Compsognathus, looking for a free meal, approach; one of them goes so far as to bite the Allosaurus’ tongue. This does not go well for the small scavenger, as the Allosaurus promptly devours it, as well as a second Compsognathus, before heading up into the rocks to find a better place to rest. The Allosaurus awakes to find himself surrounded by the Ceratosaurus pack, which had tracked it down; however, an earthquake causes the entire rock formation to collapse. The Allosaurus recovers from the fall first, and tries to escape the cavern he fell into; however, he soon discovers the exit is the edge of another cliff. The Ceratosaurus pack, however, has caught up and promptly attacks again, knocking all of them over the edge and into a river leading to a waterfall.\n\nChapter Two sees the Allosaurus washed over the edge of the waterfall into a large lake and lush green forest far different from the arid, desert landscape it had come from. Noticing a large number of herbivores, the Allosaurus emerges from the water and decides to rest and recover before trying to score a kill. However, the Ceratosaurus pack has also been washed over the waterfall and survived their ordeal. \n\nMeanwhile, the local pterosaurs squabble over the corpse of a dead Iguanadon and interact with other creatures; their power of flight means they can go from the desert to the lake and back with a great deal of ease. \n\nThe Ceratosaurus pack stalks and attacks a Stegosaurus; after a tough fight they manage to kill the herbivore, and the chapter ends with something watching them from the bushes.\n\nChapter Three sees the Allosaurus watching a herd of sauropods; however, a sudden rainstorm causes him to decide to retreat to his new lair, a small cave. The main storyline of this chapter occurs in the skies overhead. After a long chase, a green pterosaur is attacked and killed by a group of three black pterosaurs; it seems the two groups are rivals for prey or territory. A lightning strike causes a fire in the cliff face den of the green pterosaurs; one of them, in a panic, winds up falling off the cliff to its death. \n\nChapter Four begins with a massive tidal wave caused by heavy rain sweeping over the waterfall and swamping the lake; the black pterosaurs den is destroyed by this wave, with only one of them managing to escape before the wave hits. Down in the forest the Allosaurus and a small group of sauropods he was stalking try to escape the flood but are swept away. The sauropods the Allosaurus was hunting survive the waters, but dozens more drown; the Ceratosaurus pack gorges itself on the carcasses. The pack separates, and the Allosaurus sees his opportunity. Diving underwater, it manages to use the corpses of the sauropods as cover to ambush, kill and devour one of the Ceratosaurs. \n\nChapter Five begins with two of the sauropods which survived the flood making their way along the beach, passing several dead marine reptiles being fed on by pterosaurs as they do. Suddenly, they are attacked by three Ceratosaurs...but the Allosaurus is watching from the shadows. To the shock of the smaller carnivores, he suddenly intervenes, attacking the pack members. A fierce battle ensues, with one of the Ceratosaurs recognizing the Allosaurus they are fighting as the young Allosaurus which escaped them so long ago.\n\nThe Allosaurus manages to kill one of the Ceratosaurs pack by disemboweling it, and the fight turns into a game of cat and mouse. A second Ceratosaurus rushes at the Allosaurus, which manages to use his tail to knock it down and then rips out its throat. The third Ceratosaurus withdraws from the fight, causing the Allosaurus to give chase. Venturing into another cave system, the Allosaurs briefly confronts a group of Plesiosaurs in the cave’s underground river before he is ambushed by another Ceratosaurus. After a short fight, the Allosaurus dispatches his attacker and hurls the corpse into the water for the Plesiosaurs to feast on.\n\nPressing onwards, the Allosaurus discovers the final Ceratosaurus...and a nest full of baby Ceratosaurs. Rather than repeat the same actions that defined his own life, the Allosaurus decides to leave them alone and departs. The comic ends with the Allosaurus trudging off into the night. \nThe second book is more of a tale of revenge, but features a similar \"species vs. species\" rivalry. In real life Ceratosaurus was ultimately outcompeted by the larger, more advanced Allosaurus, so the storyline seems fairly realistic. It is noticeably less violent than the first book, featuring a comparatively small amount of gore.\n\n\"The Journey\" was published in 2009–10. It tells the sprawling migration of a herd of dinosaurs.\n\nThe story begins with a sweeping depiction of the North American Cretaceous forest. A massive herd composed of a large number of different species—sauropods, ankylosaurs, hadrosaurs, ceratopsians, ornithomimids and more—are preparing to embark on the annual migration journey. Their trail is stalked by predators, with an early example being a trio of raptors who descend upon the corpse of an old, sick hadrosaur which was unable to embark on the journey. As they head into a forest, a baby Triceratops spies a piece of fruit. Its parent calls out a warning, almost too late, as a tyrannosaur burst from the woods and attacks it. The baby races back towards the heard, narrowly avoiding the jaws of the tyrannosaur, as the parent rushes to the rescue, crashing into the carnivore. The baby makes it to the safety of the herd, which closes ranks in the face of the marauding predator. Rather than trying to find a gap in the herd, or risk an attack on a healthy adult Triceratops, the tyrannosaur decides to withdraw and wait for a better opportunity. \n\nThe baby Triceratops happily greets its parent, which gives the dinosaur equivalent of scolding it for wandering off and putting itself in so much danger, and the herd continues on its way. Meanwhile, hidden behind the tree line, the tyrannosaur stalks the herd, waiting for its chance. As it turns out, the tyrannosaur has two offspring of its own it needs to feed, and the three of them settle in to watch the herd go by. \n\nThe herd continues onwards, reaching a dry, dusty plain and squabbling amongst themselves. The tyrannosaur, still following them, catches a mouse to feed to its young off in the distance. \n\nChapter Two sees the herd enter a large canyon, only to find the oasis there almost completely dried up, with the only animals nearby being a large group of crocodiles. The crocodiles are starving and in no mood to share their water, and launch attacks on dinosaurs which try to come and drink. After several failed attempts they managed to bring down a sauropod. \n\nMeanwhile, the path has turned into a steep decline out of the canyon, and several herd members lose their footing and tumble to their deaths on the rocks below. The tyrannosaur and its young happily scavenge the carcasses. Meanwhile, an immense pack of raptors swarms down from the cliffs above to attack the herd. The raptors work like piranhas, swarming their prey and ripping them apart. They manage to bring down a sauropod, several hadrosaurs and triceratops, a number of smaller herbivores, and an ankylosaur, as the panicked herd flees, knowing their only chance is to get out of the area as soon as possible. While some raptors are killed in their attacks, there are well over a hundred of them on the attack, and they don’t even notice the losses. The herd moves on as the raptors gorge themselves. \n\nThe tyrannosaur and its young manage to scavenge part of the raptors’ kill that night; the raptors are simply too well fed to put up a fight as long as the tyrannosaur promptly leaves, which it does.\n\nChapter Three sees the herd enter a dense forest; a number of baby Triceratops and Ankylosaurs disorientate and sicken themselves by eating mushrooms, causing another minor confrontation between the parents of the young animals. The tyrannosaur ambushes and kills a hadrosaur which wandered off from the main herd. The herd then prepares to cross a river teeming with crocodiles, which, similarly to the raptors, swarm their targets, killing a number of the crossing herbivores. Having crossed the river, the herd continues onwards; the tyrannosaur manages to ward off the crocodiles and crosses with its young in tow as well. \n\nChapter Four sees a second wave of predators close in, as mosasaurs and plesiosaurs follow the herd as it makes its way along a beach near the ocean. A baby sauropod which had been trapped in the river onto the corpse of a hadrosaur is washed along towards the beach by the tide; as a group of mosasaurs attacks the corpse, it is forced to make a break for the shore. One mosasaur spots it and tries to move in for the kill; by sheer luck, the baby sauropod makes it onto land just as the two baby tyrannosaurs are passing nearby. The mosasaur lunges out of the surf, but the parent tyrannosaur comes rushing to the rescue, fearing for the safety of its young; a massive battle ensues. After a tough fight, both predators ultimately decide to withdraw, with the mosasaur slinking back to the deep and the tyrannosaurs sharing a moment. \n\nFinally, the herd enters another canyon and reaches its destination, a forest with a long and winding river. The various herbivores which survived the perilous journey begin feeding and settling into their new homes, while off in the distance the tyrannosaur and its young do the same. The comic ends with the sun setting over the valley.\n\n\"The Body,\" an eight-page short story, was published in \"Dark Horse Presents\" #4 in Sept. 2011. It concerns what happens to a dinosaur's body after it dies.\nAnimals in the comic:\n\nThe story begins with a pack of three Acrocanthosaurus hunting down and killing a Tenontosaurus. The large carnivores feast heavily on the carcass, briefly getting in a dispute, before moving off to find more prey. The carcass is then scavenged by a pack of Deinonychus, who engage in a fight with a group of pterosaurs over the remains. The Deinonychus ultimately withdraw and allow the pterosaurs to eat their fill. The carcass, now pretty much picked clean, lies out in the open before finally being buried by the elements to wait to be excavated millions of years later.\n\n\"Baby Turtles,\" an eight-page short story, was published in \"Dark Horse Presents\" #3 in Oct. 2014. It features the journey of baby turtles to the seas of Cretaceous North America.\n\nThe story begins with a large group of Archelon turtles hatching in a nesting ground and beginning a trek towards the sea. An overhead shot shows that there are hundreds of these small turtles...which unfortunately attracts huge numbers of predators. Pterosaurs, mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, sharks, Xiphactinus fish and all sorts of other predators lie in wait, attacking the column of baby Archelon as they make their way down the coastline and into the water. While many fall prey to the dangers lying in wait for them, sheer numbers means that many more successfully make it past the dangers. \n\nThe story ends with a long line of baby Archelon, having successfully run the gauntlet of predators, making their way out into the open ocean.\n\n\"Ancient Egyptians\" is set in prehistoric Africa. It features \"Spinosaurus\" as the protagonist, and the first installment came out on June 3, 2015. It was concluded in September 2015.\nThe story begins with a depiction of a small river and oasis in the scorching North African heat of the Cretaceous period. A Spinosaurus with numerous scars along its facial features makes into way into the oasis’ forest, briefly encountering a pair of Deltadromeus which beat a hasty retreat in the face of the hulking predator. The Spinosaurus isn’t interested in them though; its destination is the local river. Plunging under water, with nothing but the sail on its back showing, the Spinosaurus makes its way through the swamp, passing turtles, crocodiles and pterosaurs as it does so. Briefly emerging from the water, Spinosaurus attacks and devours a small crocodile before continuing ever deeper into the swamp. Resting at the river’s edge, the Spinosaurus is startled when a panicked Carcharodontosaurus plunged into the river, pursued by an enraged herd of Paralitians; the sauropods quickly trample the hapless carnivore to death, while two other Carcharodontosaurus beat a hasty retreat. \n\nThe sauropods move into the river and very nearly step on Spinosaurus, which erupts from the water and faces off with the herd. The herd leader tries to kick at Spinosaurus, only for the sail-backed dinosaur to slash the sauropod’s foot with its claws, injuring it. The herbivores are disgruntled by their leader’s injury, but they know Spinosaurus is not interested in them and withdraw from the river, leaving it alone. \n\nAfter settling back in to rest for a while, Spinosaurus emerges from the water once more, heading towards a small clearing amongst the trees where it settles down with another Spinosaurus. That night, a pack of Rugops scavenge the carcass of the dead Carcharodontosaurus; after briefly poking its head up to investigate, Spinosaurus goes back to sleep.\n\nThe next morning, Spinosaurus awakes at dawn to find crocodiles have continued feasting on the dead Carcharodontosaurus; with a yawn, it slips into the river once more. Spinosaurus catches a ray for breakfast and continues on its way as a number of smaller aquatic animals— everything from small plesiosaurs to sharks and sawfish—go about their business in its shadow. Spinosaurus then catches a large fish, fighting off an attack by a crocodile in the process. \n\nAfter another brief encounter with the Paralitian herd, Spinosaurus makes its way into another part of the swamp.\n\nThe second chapter starts with the Paralitian herd browsing on vegetation, unaware they are being stalked by a small pack of Carcharodontosaurus. The predators are eyeing the Paralitian babies playing on the edge of the herd. The predators move closer and closer and finally strike. Their hit and run attack is a massive success—they race in, snap up the young Paralitian, and flee— and there’s nothing the sauropods can do about it. \n\nSpinosaurus, meanwhile, pokes his head up out of the water in time to see the pack race on by— but he is soon distracted by the sight of another Spinosaurus. Offering her a fish he caught as a gift, the two Spinosaurs mate. \n\nThe Carcharodontosaurus pack, meanwhile, gorges itself on young Paralitian, chasing off pterosaurs who try and scavenge a meal. One of the young Paralitians is left alive to allow a baby Carcharodontosaurus to practice hunting skills; its first attack is unsuccessful, but ultimately it manages to score its first kill. \n\nSpinosaurus returns with the female Spinosaurus only to find she already has offspring from a previous mate. In a scene typical of many male predatory animals, Spinosaurus wipes most of them out— although at least one escapes— in order to ensure that it is his offspring that are cared for and have a better chance to survive. \n\nChapter Three begins with one of the Carcharodontosaurus pack bringing the remains of a dead baby Paralitian back to the clearing, only to find the rest of the pack gone; it finds out why soon enough, as the sauropod herd rumbles out of the trees, surrounds the carnivore, and brutally stomps it to death. \n\nSpinosaurus scavenges the meal to bring back to the female Spinosaurus, but she has not forgiven him for his rampage. Meanwhile, the Rugops pack approaches the herd of Paralitian as night falls; chased off by the herd leader, they swim across the river and stumble upon the Carcharodontosaurus pack feasting on crocodiles. The baby Carcharodontosaurus moves off away from the pack and the Rugops, seeing an easy kill, begin to stalk it. Soon enough they corner the baby Carcharodontosaurus; luckily for it, the adults come rushing to the rescue and chase off the Rugops pack. The Rugops head deeper into the forest, stumbling across an area where a lighting strike killed one of their number; linking up with another group of Rugops, they soon find a new place to sleep. \n\nA large group of the ever-present small scavenging reptiles attack Spinosaurus at him and the female Spinosaurus’s nest; Spinosaurus fights them off, impressing the female Spinosaurus and winning back her trust. The chapter ends with the Paralitian herd passing by Spinosaurus’ nest and the herd leader and Spinosaurus staring each other down.\n\nChapter Four begins with Spinosaurus cruising through the swamp, catching a ray in the process. However, as he emerges from the water he is confronted by the Paralitian herd...a confrontation which the Carcharodontosaurus pack watches eagerly. The Paralitian herd leader tries to stomp Spinosaurus, but he is able to outmaneuver it and raked its belly deeply with his claws. The wound causes the herd leader to collapse in agony, much to the shock and delight of the Carcharodontosaurus pack. Already licking their chops in anticipation, they waste no time in launching their own attack on the herd leader. A\nSeveral Rugops and Deltadromeus also join the attack as Spinosaurus attempts to remove himself from the confrontation. The herd leader manages to stagger on, even with more than a dozen predators ripping into it, before collapsing and going down for the last time. The various predators and scavengers begin happily feasting on the corpse. \n\nSpinosaurus returns to his nest, where it is revealed the female Spinosaurus has laid a clutch of eggs. Knowing that he would be a threat if he remains, after sharing one last goodbye look with the female Spinosaurus, he trudges off, back out of the oasis and once more into the desert. A brief scene reveals that the baby Spinosaurus which was fast enough to escape his rampage is still alive, and it watches him as he keeps moving away. The comic ends with Spinosaurus steadily moving away from the oasis and, quite literally, walking off into the sunset. \nAnimals in the Comic \n\n\nAge of Reptiles TPB\nAge of Reptiles The Hunt\nAge of Reptiles Omnibus\n"}

It had 407 luxuriously furnished rooms, 140 baths, and featured an immense and opulent lobby which was claimed to be the largest in the nation. These elements combined to make what was considered for a time to be the most luxurious hotel west of Chicago. The West was designed by LeRoy Buffington and built on land that was once owned by the first resident of Minneapolis, John H. Stevens. Buffington created the West in the Queen Anne style that was quite popular in the last decades of the 19th century. \n\nThe Queen Anne style featured an elaborate architectural look that included gable roofs, projecting bay windows, towers, and dormer windows. The West combined most of these concepts into a grand, larger than life look that seems graceless to some modern observers but was a popular building style at the time, a style that was introduced in 1876 at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. \n\nThe West hotel was situated on the southwest corner of the intersection of Hennepin Avenue and Fifth Street (the site currently occupied, in part, by the Shubert Theatre, moved there in 1999), in the center of a burgeoning entertainment district that started coming together in the 1880s and was a temporary home to such well-known public figures as Mark Twain and Winston Churchill. It also catered to delegates of the 1892 Republican National Convention (held at the Exposition Building across the Mississippi River). It was Minneapolis's largest and most luxurious hotel for many years after its construction. \n\nIn 1906 a large fire burned through the hotel killing 10 people.

According to local legend in Utrecht, she led a large group of women on May 2, 1577 to the castle of Vredenburg and gave the signal to begin demolishing the castle.\n\nThe castle of Vredenburg had been built by emperor Charles V after annexing Utrecht in 1528, and was manned by a Spanish garrison. On November 8, 1576 the Pacification of Ghent was signed and the Eighty Years' War began. The Dutch rebels besieged the Vredenburg fortress and, following negotiations, the garrison abandoned the castle in February 1577.\n\nThe citizens of Utrecht demanded that the abandoned castle be demolished, but the city government would not allow it, so on May 2 the Utrechters, led by Trijn van Leemput, took matters into their own hands. The events that followed were recorded by contemporaries Arnold Buchelius (1565–1641) and Joh. van Beverwyck (1594–1647). Later historians have cast doubt on the historical accuracy of the tale. Most likely it is part legend and partly based on fact.\n\nTrijn van Leemput is said to have gathered a large group of women and marched on the castle, carrying a makeshift banner made out of a blue apron tied to a broom. At the castle, she signalled for the demolishment to begin by removing some bricks from the castle walls. The other Utrechters followed suit, and began breaking down the walls using axes, hammers and pick-axes.\n\nShe is also said to have fought two Spanish soldiers, who were lodged at her house, at an earlier occasion. After catching them stealing, she threw one down the stairs and threatened the other with a knife.\n\nArchival research has shown that Trijn van Leemput really existed and was born around 1530, probably near Vreeswijk. She and her husband, brewer and miller Jan Jacob van Leemput, moved into a large house on the Oudegracht canal in Utrecht in 1555. The family was one of the city's most prominent families. Trijn's husband was a guild leader and member of the city government, and was one of the four deputies who negotiated with William the Silent on the conditions for Utrecht's entry into the Pacification of Ghent, the Dutch coalition against Spain. Trijn van Leemput died in Utrecht.\n\nAs early as the 17th century, Trijn van Leemput was depicted in various paintings. A statue of her, pick-axe in hand, was erected on , near her home, in 1955.\n\n"}

{"id": "1959210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1959210", "title": "Vincent Bourne", "text": "Vincent Bourne\n\nVincent Bourne, familiarly known as Vinny Bourne (1695, Westminster2 December 1747), was an English classical scholar and Neo-Latin poet.\n\nEven near contemporaries could find little biographical information about Vincent Bourne. His father's name was Andrew and he was born in 1695. In 1710 he was admitted to Westminster School and was elected to a scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 27 May 1714, proceeding to B.A. in 1717 and becoming a fellow of his college in 1720. In 1721, the year he commenced his M.A., he edited a collection of \"Carmina Comitialia\" which contains, among the \"Miscellanea\" at the end, some verses of his own, including his tripos poem on Androcles.\n\nOn leaving Cambridge he became a master at Westminster School, and continued to hold this appointment until his death. He was a man of peaceful temperament, content to pass his life in indolent repose. As a teacher he wanted energy, and he was a very lax disciplinarian. The poet William Cowper, who was one of his pupils and particularly fond of Bourne, commented that he was so inattentive to his pupils, and so indifferent whether they brought him good or bad exercises, that \"he seemed determined, as he was the best, so to be the last, Latin poet of the Westminster line.\" In another letter Cowper wrote, \"I lost more than I got by him; for he made me as idle as himself.\"\nIn 1734 he published his \"Poemata, Latine partim reddita, partim scripta\", with a dedication to the Duke of Newcastle, and in November of the same year he was appointed housekeeper and deputy sergeant-at-arms to the House of Commons. Later the Duke of Newcastle offered him valuable ecclesiastical preferment, which he declined from conscientious motives. In a letter to his wife, written shortly before his death, he summed up his feelings: \"I own and declare that the importance of so great a charge, joined with a mistrust of my own sufficiency, made me fearful of undertaking it: if I have not in that capacity assisted in the salvation of souls, I have not been the means of losing any; if I have not brought reputation to the function by any merit of mine, I have the comfort of this reflection — I have given no scandal to it by my meanness and unworthiness.\"\n\nBourne died on 2 December 1747 and was buried at Fulham. His will mentions two children: a daughter named Lucia after her mother and his son Thomas, who was a lieutenant in the marines and about to sail for India. It also mentions a house in Westminster and farm in Bungay. In later years, Mrs Bourne became a Sister at the Royal Hospital and Collegiate Church of Saint Katharine. She was followed there by her daughter, who died unmarried in 1807.\n\nThere were nine editions of Bourne's Latin poems in all, of which the posthumous 1772 quarto was criticised for containing several that demonstrably did not belong to him. Later editions were sometimes accompanied by the translations of others, notably the nineteen written by Cowper. The final 1840 edition of his \"Poematia\" contains a memoir and a survey of his writing by John Mitford. Thereafter he was little noticed until the recent revival of interest in Latin poetry.\n\nWilliam Cowper's too partial assessment of Bourne's poetry, in a letter to the Reverend John Newton dated 10 May 1781, frequently prefaced the various editions of his work. \"I love the memory of Vinny Bourne. I think him a better Latin poet than Tibullus, Propertius, Ausonius, or any of the writers in his way except Ovid, and not at all inferior to him.\" Charles Lamb was also an admirer and translated eight more of his poems. In an enthusiastic letter to William Wordsworth, written in 1815, he summed up Bourne's poetical approach as \"sucking from every flower, making a flower of everything! His diction all Latin, and his thoughts all English!\" \nThe charm of Bourne's poems lies not so much in the elegance of his Latinity as in the breadth and humour of his subject matter. He had quick sympathy for his fellow-men, and loving tenderness towards all animals. His epitaphs are models of simplicity and grace. A later critic commented on his epigrammatic style that \"his natural taste brought to that form an almost lyrical delicacy of touch which makes his vignettes of contemporary life a new genre … In Bourne it is the exact and sympathetic observation of the particular contemporary scene which charms us. His work shows the final and complete emancipation of the eighteenth-century Latin poet from the theory of imitating the classics which had dominated the Renaissance.\"\n\nSome of his subjects tested his linguistic ingenuity to the full, having to encompass a man smoking a pipe, a magic lantern show, a pair of spectacles, a coach too full of people, or a crowd milling about street ballad singers. His playfulness is particularly apparent in treating animal subjects such as a jackdaw inhabiting a steeple, a snail, or sparrows feeding in a Cambridge college, all poems translated by Cowper. Another, \"Canis et Echo\", features a dog barking at the moon reflected in the Thames, and then at the echo of its own voice. The theme is further imitated by repetition within the text: \n\nNevertheless, despite the elegance and adaptability of Bourne's style, the essayist A. C. Benson comments that \"an exhaustive account of his Latinity would be a long enumeration of minute mistakes arising from the imperfect acquaintance of the scholars of the day with the principles of correct Latinity\", Bourne's final 19th century editor having enumerated these at some length. But, Benson concludes, his former popularity as a poet rested on the fact that he was \"a man with a warm heart and a capacious eye, finding any trait of human character, any grouping of the grotesque or tender furniture of life, interesting and memorable...Absent-minded he may have been, but observant he was to a peculiar degree, and that not of broad poetical effects, but of the minute detail and circumstance of every-day life.\"\n\nIn addition, Bourne translated into Latin poems by some of the principal Augustan poets of his time, including Nicholas Rowe, John Gay, Matthew Prior, John Arbuthnot and Joseph Addison, whose \"Three Divine Hymns\" fitted his religious frame of mind. In particular also he translated narratives such as David Mallet's \"William and Margaret\" and Thomas Tickell's ballad of \"Lucy and Colin\". As these writers adapted the Augustan spirit to themes of the time, so Bourne endeavoured also to update the Latin language to encompass similar themes.\n"}

He is also the co-host of \"The Starting Lineup\", which airs weekdays from 7 a.m. 10 a.m. ET on SiriusXM NBA Radio.\n\nRaised in Enumclaw, Washington, Scalabrine attended the University of Southern California after transferring from Highline College. As a member of the USC Trojans men's basketball team, Scalabrine was the top scorer and a leader in field goals and rebounds. He also played at the center position in college.\n\nThe New Jersey Nets selected him in the second round of the 2001 NBA draft. The Nets made consecutive NBA Finals his first two years, and Scalabrine played four seasons with the team. In 2005, he signed with the Boston Celtics and won a championship with the team in 2008. The Celtics also appeared in the 2010 NBA Finals. Scalabrine signed with the Chicago Bulls the following season, and played with them until 2012. Throughout his NBA career, Scalabrine served as a backup power forward.\n\nIn 2013, Mark Jackson announced that Scalabrine would join his Golden State Warriors coaching staff. In 2014, Scalabrine took a job as an analyst for Celtics games on local Boston broadcasts.\n\nBorn in Long Beach, California, Scalabrine was one of four children in his family and graduated from Enumclaw High School at Enumclaw, Washington in 1996. He is of Italian ancestry. He enrolled at Highline College in 1996, played his first year with its basketball team the Thunderbirds, and redshirted his second year. As a freshman at Highline, Scalabrine averaged 16.3 points, 9.6 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 1.2 steals per game. Scalabrine recorded seventeen double-doubles, and led the team in rebounds, blocks, and free throw percentage (75%). The Thunderbirds went 31-1 in the 1996–97 season and won the state junior college championship. Scalabrine was a Northern Division All-Star in 1997 as well as part of the All-Northwest Athletic Association of Community Colleges Championship Tournament Team.\n\nIn 1998, he transferred to the University of Southern California (USC). In his first year with the USC Trojans men's basketball team, he was the only player to start all 28 games. He led the Trojans in scoring (14.6 points), rebounding (6.4), and field goals (53.1%). In scoring, blocked shots, and field goals, he was also the only Pac-10 conference player among the top 10 players in those areas. His best game performance was against American University on December 21, 1998: 26 points, seven rebounds, and two blocks. On February 13, 1999, he scored 22 points including an important three-pointer in overtime; the unranked USC won an upset victory over number-six Stanford 86-82 in overtime. He was the 1999 Pac-10 Newcomer of the Year and earned an All-Pac-10 honorable mention.\n\nDuring his second season with USC, Scalabrine was named to the All-Pac-10 first team and the National Association of Basketball Coaches All-District 15 first team. He also earned a \"Sporting News\" All-American honorable mention. Again, he finished as USC's top scorer (17.8 ppg) and field goal shooter (53.1%) and was also the second-best Pac-10 scorer. He also made 40.3% of attempted three-pointers. Against the Oregon Ducks, Scalabrine scored 29 points and made 10 rebounds.\n\nUSC advanced to the NCAA tournament in 2001, Scalabrine's senior season. In the Elite Eight round, USC lost to Duke 79-69; Scalabrine scored 13 points. Scalabrine graduated with a degree in history.\n\nBecause he injured his fifth metatarsal bone during workouts in late September 2001, Scalabrine missed the first ten days of New Jersey Nets training camp. During the second quarter of the final 2001–02 preseason game, which took place against the Detroit Pistons on October 26, 2001, Scalabrine again injured his right foot. He made his NBA debut on January 31, 2002, when the Nets played against the Milwaukee Bucks. As a rookie, Scalabrine averaged 2.1 points, 1.8 rebounds, and 0.8 assists per game. He played in six playoff games his debut season and averaged 0.3 points and 0.5 rebounds. The Nets were the Eastern Conference Champions of the 2001–02 season and lost the 2002 NBA Finals to the Los Angeles Lakers in four games. In a triple-overtime victory over the Detroit Pistons in Game 5 of the 2004 Eastern Conference Semifinal series, Scalabrine scored a career high 17 points. He surpassed that high with 29 points on January 26, 2005 against the Golden State Warriors. On April 15, 2005, he played a career high 45 minutes.\n\nDuring his time with the Nets, Scalabrine gained the nickname \"Veal\", a play on words based on the dish veal scaloppini.\n\nOn August 2, 2005, Scalabrine signed a five-year contract with the Boston Celtics. A month earlier, he and the team agreed on terms that the contract be worth $15 million over the five years.\n\nScalabrine started in nine of 48 games during the 2007–08 season, and played on average 10.7 minutes. He averaged 1.8 points and 1.6 rebounds per game. On April 16, 2008, in the final game of the regular season, Scalabrine tied a season-high with six rebounds and played 29 minutes. He did not make an appearance in the NBA playoffs. In the 2008 Finals, the Celtics defeated the Lakers in six games.\n\nOn September 21, 2010, Scalabrine agreed to a non-guaranteed contract with the Chicago Bulls. The Bulls visited the Boston Celtics on November 5, 2010, and in double overtime the Bulls won 110-105. Scalabrine played only three minutes that game. He played 18 games with the Bulls and averaged 1.1 points and 0.4 rebounds per game.\n\nOn September 22, 2011, during the 2011 NBA lockout, Scalabrine signed with the Italian team Benetton Treviso. He left the team in December 2011 to pursue opportunities in the NBA after the lockout had ended.\n\nOn December 12, 2011, Scalabrine re-signed with the Bulls. During the 2011-12 season, Scalabrine played in 28 games. In September 2012, he was offered a position as an assistant coach for the Bulls under Tom Thibiodeau, but instead opted to become a broadcaster for the Boston Celtics.\n\nIn September 2012, Scalabrine announced that he had turned down an opportunity to become an assistant coach with the Bulls so that he could join Comcast SportsNet New England as a commentator. Scalabrine described the job as \"a trial run\", and said there was a \"small possibility\" he would resume his playing career overseas in 2013.\n\nIn July 2013, Golden State Warriors coach Mark Jackson announced via Twitter that Scalabrine was joining his coaching staff. During the season, Jackson reassigned Scalabrine to the Warriors' D-League affiliate after a difference of opinion on the team's direction.\n\nIn 2014, Scalabrine wrote an essay to Boston to announce his \"homecoming\" to become a Comcast SportsNet announcer. His essay spoofed a famous \"Sports Illustrated\" story about LeBron James's return to Cleveland.\n\nIn 2017, Brian joined the Ball Hogs of the BIG3 basketball league.\n\nScalabrine married Kristen Couch in 2003; their wedding ceremony was held in Hawaii. They have two children. He is also a member of the sports philanthropy organization Athletes for Hope.\n\nDespite his limited playing time, Scalabrine became a popular player. Bulls fans referred to him as \"The White Mamba\", a play on Kobe Bryant's nickname of \"The Black Mamba\".\n\n"}

The first ran from 1951 to 1961, the second from 1970 to 1972 and the third was part of The New 52 and ran from September 2011 to August 2014.\n\nThe original \"All-Star Western\" began with #58 (May 1951), having taken over the number of its predecessor title, \"All Star Comics\" — a superhero omnibus that years before had introduced the enduring team the Justice Society of America. With the postwar decline in the popularity of superheroes, publisher DC Comics changed the series format and title. \"All-Star Western\" ran 62 bimonthly issues through #119 (July 1961). The cover logo did not include a hyphen until issue #108 (Sept. 1959), when it was much reduced in size and placed above the much larger logo for what was then the title feature, \"Johnny Thunder\". Johnny Thunder remained on the cover until the final issue, #119, occasionally sharing it with Madame .44, \"the masked outlaw queen.\"\n\nThe first issue contained the features \"The Trigger Twins\", created by writer Robert Kanigher and penciler Carmine Infantino and running through #116; \"Don Caballero\", drawn by Gil Kane, and \"Roving Ranger\", penciled by Alex Toth, the writer-creator uncredited; and \"Strong Bow\", created by writer David Wood and artist Frank Giacoia. Other features that appeared through the years included \"Super-Chief\", by writer Gardner Fox and artist Infantino; and, beginning with #67 (Nov. 1952), \"Johnny Thunder\", featuring the masked, vigilante persona of a schoolteacher in an Old West Mormon settlement. The character had been created by writer Kanigher and artist Toth in DC's \"All-American Comics\" in 1948.\n\nThe series was revived in the following decade, and ran 11 bimonthly issues (Sept. 1970 – May 1972) before changing its title and, slightly its format to become \"Weird Western Tales\". \"All-Star Western\" vol. 2, #1 starred Pow-Wow Smith, scripted by John Broome, with art by Carmine Infantino. The next four starred the characters Outlaw and El Diablo. With issue #5, the character Outlaw was dropped, with the cover logo \"Outlaw\" now referring to the replacement-feature star, Billy the Kid. The Western \"all-stars\" now included such historical characters as Wild Bill Hickok, Buffalo Bill and Davy Crockett, in a mix of new stories and reprints, as well as DC stalwarts Pow-Wow Smith, El Diablo and Bat Lash.\n\nIssue #10 (February–March 1972) introduced the enduring and popular character Jonah Hex, created by writer John Albano and artist Tony DeZuniga. Hex continued as the star of the comic when it changed its name to \"Weird Western Tales\" with issue #12 (July 1972), and he continued into issue #38 (Feb. 1977) of the 59-issue series.\n\nThe series was revived as part of the line-wide The New 52 relaunch in September 2011, written by Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti with art by Moritat. The series followed the adventures of Jonah Hex and Amadeus Arkham in an Old West-version of Gotham City, with back-up tales featuring other Western characters such as:\nAfter issue #21 the backup features stopped.

{"id": "1959215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1959215", "title": "Organosulfur compounds", "text": "Organosulfur compounds\n\nOrganosulfur compounds are organic compounds that contain sulfur. They are often associated with foul odors, but many of the sweetest compounds known are organosulfur derivatives, e.g., saccharin. Nature abounds with organosulfur compounds—sulfur is essential for life. Of the 20 common amino acids, two (cysteine and methionine) are organosulfur compounds, and the antibiotics penicillin and sulfa drugs both contain sulfur. While sulfur-containing antibiotics save many lives, sulfur mustard is a deadly chemical warfare agent. Fossil fuels, coal, petroleum, and natural gas, which are derived from ancient organisms, necessarily contain organosulfur compounds, the removal of which is a major focus of oil refineries.\n\nSulfur shares the chalcogen group with oxygen, selenium, and tellurium, and it is expected that organosulfur compounds have similarities with carbon–oxygen, carbon–selenium, and carbon–tellurium compounds.\n\nA classical chemical test for the detection of sulfur compounds is the Carius halogen method.\n\nOrganosulfur compounds can be classified according to the sulfur-containing functional groups, which are listed (approximately) in decreasing order of their occurrence.\n\nSulfides, formerly known as thioethers, are characterized by C−S−C bonds Relative to C−C bonds, C−S bond are both longer, because S is larger than carbon, and about 10% weaker. Representative bond lengths in sulfur compounds are 183 pm for the S−C single bond in methanethiol and 173 pm in thiophene. The C−S bond dissociation energy for thiomethane is 89 kcal/mol (370 kJ/mol) compared to methane's 100 kcal/mol (420 kJ/mol) and when hydrogen is replaced by a methyl group the energy decreases to 73 kcal/mol (305 kJ/mol). The single carbon to oxygen bond is shorter than that of the C−C bond. The bond dissociation energies for dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl ether are respectively 73 and 77 kcal/mol (305 and 322 kJ/mol).\n\nSulfides are typically prepared by alkylation of thiols. They can also be prepared via the Pummerer rearrangement. In one named reaction called the Ferrario reaction phenyl ether is converted to \"phenoxathiin\" by action of elemental sulfur and aluminium chloride.\n\nThioacetals and thioketals feature C−S−C−S−C bond sequence. They represent a subclass of sulfides. The thioacetals are useful in \"umpolung\" of carbonyl groups. Thioacetals and thioketals can also be used to protect a carbonyl group in organic syntheses.\n\nThe above classes of sulfur compounds also exist in saturated and unsaturated heterocyclic structures, often in combination with other heteroatoms, as illustrated by thiiranes, thiirenes, thietanes, thietes, dithietanes, thiolanes, thianes, dithianes, thiepanes, thiepines, thiazoles, isothiazoles, and thiophenes, among others. The latter three compounds represent a special class of sulfur-containing heterocycles that are aromatic. The resonance stabilization of thiophene is 29 kcal/mol (121 kJ/mol) compared to 20 kcal/mol (84 kJ/mol) for the oxygen analogue furan. The reason for this difference is the higher electronegativity for oxygen drawing away electrons to itself at the expense of the aromatic ring current. Yet as an aromatic substituent the thio group is less electron-releasing than the alkoxy group. Dibenzothiophenes (see drawing), tricyclic heterocycles consisting of two benzene rings fused to a central thiophene ring, occurs widely in heavier fractions of petroleum.\n\nThiol group contain the functionality R−SH. Thiols are structurally similar to the alcohol group, but these functionalities are very different in their chemical properties. Thiols are more nucleophilic, more acidic, and more readily oxidized. This acidity can differ by 5 p\"K\" units.\n\nThe difference in electronegativity between sulfur (2.58) and hydrogen (2.20) is small and therefore hydrogen bonding in thiols is not prominent. Aliphatic thiols form monolayers on gold, which are topical in nanotechnology.\n\nCertain aromatic thiols can be accessed through a Herz reaction.\n\nDisulfides R−S−S−R with a covalent sulfur to sulfur bond are important for crosslinking: in biochemistry for the folding and stability of some proteins and in polymer chemistry for the crosslinking of rubber.\n\nLonger sulfur chains are also known, such as in the natural product varacin which contains an unusual pentathiepin ring (5-sulfur chain cyclised onto a benzene ring).\n\nThioesters have general structure R−C(O)−S−R. They are related to regular esters (R−C(O)−O−R) but are more susceptible to hydrolysis and related reactions. Thioesters are prominent in biochemistry, especially in fatty acid synthesis.\n\nA sulfoxide, R−S(O)−R, is the \"S\"-oxide of a sulfide (\"sulfide oxide\"), a sulfone, R−S(O)−R, is the \"S\",\"S\"-dioxide of a sulfide, a thiosulfinate, R−S(O)−S−R, is the \"S\"-oxide of a disulfide, and a thiosulfonate, R−S(O)−S−R, is the \"S\",\"S\"-dioxide of a disulfide. All of these compounds are well known with extensive chemistry, e.g., dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl sulfone, and allicin (see drawing).\n\nSulfimides (also called a sulfilimines) are sulfur–nitrogen compounds of structure RS=NR′, the nitrogen analog of sulfoxides. They are of interest in part due to their pharmacological properties. When two different R groups are attached to sulfur, sulfimides are chiral. Sulfimides form stable α-carbanions.\n\nSulfoximides (also called sulfoximines) are tetracoordinate sulfur–nitrogen compounds, isoelectronic with sulfones, in which one oxygen atom of the sulfone is replaced by a substituted nitrogen atom, e.g., RS(O)=NR′. When two different R groups are attached to sulfur, sulfoximides are chiral. Much of the interest in this class of compounds is derived from the discovery that methionine sulfoximide (methionine sulfoximine) is an inhibitor of glutamine synthetase.\n\nSulfonediimines (also called sulfodiimines, sulfodiimides or sulfonediimides) are tetracoordinate sulfur–nitrogen compounds, isoelectronic with sulfones, in which both oxygen atoms of the sulfone are replaced by a substituted nitrogen atom, e.g., RS(=NR′). They are of interest because of their biological activity and as building blocks for heterocycle synthesis.\n\n\"S\"-Nitrosothiols, also known as thionitrites, are compounds containing a nitroso group attached to the sulfur atom of a thiol, e.g. R−S−N=O. They have received considerable attention in biochemistry because they serve as donors of the nitrosonium ion, NO, and nitric oxide, NO, which may serve as signaling molecules in living systems, especially related to vasodilation.\n\nA wide range of organosulfur compounds are known which contain one or more halogen atom (\"X\" in the chemical formulas that follow) bonded to a single sulfur atom, e.g.: sulfenyl halides, RSX; sulfinyl halides, RS(O)X; sulfonyl halides, RSOX; alkyl and arylsulfur trichlorides, RSCl and trifluorides, RSF; and alkyl and arylsulfur pentafluorides, RSF. Less well known are dialkylsulfur tetrahalides, mainly represented by the tetrafluorides, e.g., RSF.\n\nCompounds with double bonds between carbon and sulfur are relatively uncommon, but include the important compounds carbon disulfide, carbonyl sulfide, and thiophosgene. Thioketones (RC(=S)R′) are uncommon with alkyl substituents, but one example is thiobenzophenone. Thioaldehydes are rarer still, reflecting their lack of steric protection (\"thioformaldehyde\" exists as a cyclic trimer). Thioamides, with the formula RC(=S)N(R)R are more common. They are typically prepared by the reaction of amides with Lawesson's reagent. Isothiocyanates, with formula R−N=C=S, are found naturally. Vegetable foods with characteristic flavors due to isothiocyanates include wasabi, horseradish, mustard, radish, Brussels sprouts, watercress, nasturtiums, and capers.\n\nThe \"S\"-oxides of thiocarbonyl compounds are known as thiocarbonyl \"S\"-oxides or sulfines, RC=S=O, and thiocarbonyl \"S\",\"S\"-dioxides or sulfenes, RC=SO. These compounds are well known with extensive chemistry, e.g., see \"syn\"-propanethial-\"S\"-oxide and sulfene.\n\nTriple bonds between sulfur and carbon in sulfaalkynes are rare and can be found in carbon monosulfide (CS) and have been suggested for the compounds FCCSF and FSCSF. The compound HCSOH is also represented as having a formal triple bond.\n\nThiocarboxylic acids (RC(O)SH) and dithiocarboxylic acids (RC(S)SH) are well known. They are structurally similar to carboxylic acids but more acidic. Thioamides are analogous to amides.\n\nSulfonic acids have functionality R−S(=O)−OH. They are strong acids that are typically soluble in organic solvents. Sulfonic acids like trifluoromethanesulfonic acid is a frequently used reagent in organic chemistry. Sulfinic acids have functionality R−S(O)−H while sulfenic acids have functionality R−S−OH. In the series sulfonic—sulfinic—sulfenic acids, both the acid strength and stability diminish in that order. Sulfonamides, sulfinamides and sulfenamides, with formulas R−SONR′, R−S(O)NR′, and R−SNR′, respectively, each have a rich chemistry. For example, sulfa drugs are sulfonamides derived from aromatic sulfonation. Chiral sulfinamides are used in asymmetric synthesis, while sulfenamides are used extensively in the vulcanization process to assist cross-linking. Thiocyanates, R−S−CN, are related to sulfenyl halides and esters in terms of reactivity.\n\nA sulfonium ion is a positively charged ion featuring three organic substituents attached to sulfur, with the formula [RS]. Together with their negatively charged counterpart, the anion, the compounds are called sulfonium salts. An oxosulfonium ion is a positively charged ion featuring three organic substituents and an oxygen attached to sulfur, with the formula [RS=O]. Together with their negatively charged counterpart, the anion, the compounds are called oxosulfonium salts. Related species include alkoxysulfonium and chlorosulfonium ions, [RSOR] and [RSCl], respectively.\n\nDeprotonation of sulfonium and oxosulfonium salts affords ylides, of structure RS−C−R′ and RS(O)−C−R′. While sulfonium ylides, for instance in the Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky reaction used to synthesize oxiranes, are sometimes drawn with a C=S double bond, e.g., RS=CR′, the ylidic carbon–sulfur bond is highly polarized and is better described as being ionic. Sulfonium ylides are key intermediates in the synthetically useful Stevens rearrangement. Thiocarbonyl ylides (RR′C=S−C−RR′) can form by ring-opening of thiiranes, photocyclization of aryl vinyl sulfides, as well as by other processes.\n\nSulfuranes are relatively specialized functional group that are tetravalent, hypervalent sulfur compounds, with the formula SR and likewise persulfuranes are hexavalent SR. All-carbon hexavalent complexes have been known for the heavier representatives of the chalcogen group, for instance the compound hexamethylpertellurane (Te(Me)) was discovered in 1990 by reaction of tetramethyltellurium with xenon difluoride to TeF(CH) followed by reaction with dimethylzinc. The sulfur analogue hexamethylpersulfurane (S(CH)) has been predicted to be stable but has not been synthesized yet.\n\nThe first ever all-carbon persulfurane actually synthesized in a laboratory has two methyl and two biphenyl ligands:\n\nIt is prepared from the corresponding sulfurane 1 with xenon difluoride / boron trifluoride in acetonitrile to the sulfuranyl dication 2 followed by reaction with methyllithium in tetrahydrofuran to (a stable) persulfurane 3 as the cis isomer. X-ray diffraction shows C−S bond lengths ranging between 189 and 193 pm (longer than the standard bond length) with the central sulfur atom in a distorted octahedral molecular geometry.\n\nComputer simulation suggests that these bonds are very polar with the negative charges residing on carbon.\n\nNot all organosulfur compounds are foul-smelling pollutants. Penicillin and cephalosporin are life-saving antibiotics, derived from fungi. Gliotoxin is a sulfur-containing mycotoxin produced by several species of fungi under investigation as an antiviral agent. Compounds like allicin and ajoene are responsible for the odor of garlic, and lenthionine contributes to the flavor of shiitake mushrooms. Volatile organosulfur compounds also contribute subtle flavor characteristics to wine, nuts, cheddar cheese, chocolate, coffee, and tropical fruit flavors. Many of these natural products also have important medicinal properties such as preventing platelet aggregation or fighting cancer.\n\nMost organic sulfur compounds in the environment are naturally occurring, as a consequence of the fact that sulfur is essential for life and two amino acids (cysteine and methionine) contain this element.\n\nSome organosulfur compounds in the environment, are generated as minor by-products of industrial processes such as the manufacture of plastics and tires.\n\nSelected smell-producing processes are organosulfur compounds produced by the coking of coal designed to drive out sulfurous compounds and other volatile impurities in order to produce 'clean carbon' (coke), which is primarily used for steel production.\n\nOdours occur as well in chemical processing of coal or crude oil into precursor chemicals (feedstocks) for downstream industrial uses (e.g. plastics or pharmaceutical production) and the ubiquitous needs of petroleum distillation for gasolines, diesel, and other grades of fuel oils production.\n\nOrganosulfur compounds might be understood as aromatic contaminants that need to be removed from natural gas before commercial uses, from exhaust stacks and exhaust vents before discharge. In this latter context, organosulfur compounds may be said to account for the pollutants in sulfurous acid rain, or equivalently, said to be pollutants within most common fossil fuels, especially coal.\n\nThe most common organosulfur compound present in all petroleum fractions is thiophene (CHS), a cyclic and aromatic liquid. In addition, the heavy fractions of oil contain benzothiophene (CHS, thianaphtene) and dibenzothiophene. Most of the last compounds are solids and smell like naphthalene. Many methylated, dimethyl, diethyl benzothiophene derivatives are present in diesel and fuel oils which make fuel oils very difficult to clean.\n\nAll these heterocyclic sulfides account for 200–500 ppm of natural fuel, the heavily substituted dibenzothiophenes remain after HDS and account for 10–20 ppm. These molecules are also found in coals and they must be eliminated before consumption.\n\nReduced molybdenum together with nickel is currently used to eliminate thiophenes from petroleum (HDS) due to its great affinity towards sulfur.\nIn addition tungsten together with nickel and cobalt is used for hydrodesulfurization (HDS) in large refineries. The adsorption mechanism of thiophene to transition metals is proposed to occur through the π system, where the organosulfur compound lies almost parallel to the metal surface.\nMany researchers focus their efforts in optimizing the oxidation state of the transition metals for HDS, like Cu(I) and Ag(II) which together with Pd(0) have proven to be more specific for π bonding with thiophenes of all kinds.\n\nHumans and other animals have an exquisitely sensitive sense of smell toward the odor of low-valent organosulfur compounds such as thiols, sulfides, and disulfides. Malodorous volatile thiols are protein-degradation products found in putrid food, so sensitive identification of these compounds is crucial to avoiding intoxication. Low-valent volatile sulfur compounds are also found in areas where oxygen levels in the air are low, posing a risk of suffocation. It has been found that copper is required for the highly sensitive detection of certain volatile thiols and related organosulfur compounds by olfactory receptors in mice. Whether humans, too, require copper for sensitive detection of thiols is not yet known.\n"}

Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore, gave Spark to Ogle by during Ogle's trip to England in 1740; the Prince of Wales presented the gift to Ogle. Later, Benjamin Tasker, Jr., brought Selima to Belair, where she became a prominent producer.\n\nIn 1898 the property was sold to the wealthy New York City banker James T. Woodward. who built large new stables in 1907. On his death his will bequeathed the property to his nephew, William Woodward, Sr., who built Belair Stud and Stable into the preeminent United States racing and breeding operation during the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.\n\nDuring World War I, American horsemen were able to purchase well-bred foals from French breeders who could not afford to feed them during the extremely difficult war years. Some were bought directly by breeders while many were purchased by brokers who immediately resold them in America at the various Thoroughbred auctions. As such, William Woodward, Sr. was able to build his broodmare band on French imports.\n\nUnder William Woodward, Sr., the farm produced some of the greatest thoroughbred racehorses in the United States. He was part of a syndicate of breeders who purchased Sir Gallahad III in France and brought him to America. Some of Woodward's most famous horses were Gallant Fox and Omaha, the only father-and-son horses ever to win the U.S. Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing.\n\nIn 1752, Selima won the biggest prize of the era, 2,500 pistoles at Gloucester, Virginia, which marked \"the beginning of the remarkable racing contests between the rival colonies of Maryland and Virginia.\"\n\nFrom 1923 to 1953, Belair Stud horses won 631 races, were second 568 times, and were third 540 times. Included in their victories were numerous important stakes races, and five of their horses were voted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. Under trainer Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons, the stable won the following prestigious U.S. Triple Crown races:\n\n"}

The term \"Czenglish\" is first recorded in 1989, with the slightly earlier variant \"Czechlish\" recorded from 1982.\n\nExamples include confusing verbatim translations (such as \"basic school\" for \"\", which should be \"primary school\" or \"elementary school\"), incorrect word order in a sentence and use of inappropriate prepositions and conjunctions because of the influence of their Czech equivalents.\n\nAnother typical aspect is the absence of definite articles (due to the lack of articles in the Czech language) and the use of \"some\" in place of an indefinite article. In Czenglish and other Central European accents is often pronounced as , or ; as , and as an alveolar trill as in some Scottish accents, rather than the more standard approximant. Voiced consonants at the end of words like \"big\" are pronounced unvoiced (); \"ng\" is understood as a /ng/ sequence and therefore follows the final devoicing rule (e.g. to sing merges with to sink ).\n\nMost elements of Czenglish only cause little confusion and are eventually understood by a native speaker. Some, however, may lead to embarrassing situations, since to a native English speaker they seem to be correct English sentences, although the Czech speaker meant to say something different. Such misunderstanding may be recognized only by considering the appropriateness of each of the possible meanings in the given context.

It allows a person the use of property for a fixed term, and the right to buy that property for the agreed residual value when the term expires.\n\nClosed-end leases are so called because they run for a fixed term, and the lessor and lessee agree in the lease contract what the residual value of the property being leased will be. In most cases (particularly in retail motor vehicle leases), the lessee has an option to purchase the property for the agreed residual value at the end of the lease term. Closed-end leases are not used for property which increases in value.\n\nIn most cases, when a closed-end lease is entered, the lessor does not already own the property being leased. Rather, the lessor agrees to purchase the property for a certain amount (the \"capitalized cost\") from a third party, such as a car dealer. The lessee will often be required to offer money up front as an offset against the capitalized cost (this is called the \"capitalized cost reduction\" although it is sometimes erroneously referred to as a \"down payment\"). The difference between the (adjusted) capitalized cost and the residual value is the depreciation component of the lease cost. In addition to depreciation, the lessee must also pay the lessor's cost of financing the purchase of the vehicle, which is referred to as \"rent\"; the rent also includes the lessor's profit.\n\nThe total lease cost can either be paid in a single lump sum, or amortized over the term of the lease with periodic (usually monthly) payments.\n\nClosed-end leases generally provide that the lessee is responsible for insuring the property, for maintaining it in accordance with the lessor's requirements, and for paying any taxes or license fees which may be assessed on the lessor as owner of record. Motor vehicle leases generally include a provision for determining the amount of \"excess wear and tear\" (or \"wear and use\") at the end of the lease term, for which the lessee is responsible upon returning the vehicle.\n\nClosed-end leases have become very popular for automobile buyers in North America since the mid-1980s. Shield laws in most states allow lessors to avoid legal responsibility for the actions of their lessees, which has made it practical for automakers to offer leases direct to consumers without fear of \"deep pockets\" liability for injuries resulting from an accident. In those states which assess a use tax on vehicles, lessees need only pay tax on the amount of their lease payment, not on the entire value of their vehicle at the time of purchase. Finally, and most significantly, because lessees pay only for depreciation and financing, and not the entire retail cost of the vehicle, payments can be significantly lower than in loan-based financing. This allows consumers to significantly shorten their purchase cycle, increasing new-vehicle sales, which gives the automakers reason to emphasize leasing programs in their marketing.\n\nClosed-end leases are not always the best choice for consumers. The finance companies which offer consumer car leases frequently require lessees to hold more costly insurance policies than would otherwise be necessary. Automakers often view leasing as a sales tool, and artificially inflate the lease-end residual value; this can make exercising the purchase option at the end of a lease more expensive than simply financing the vehicle over the longer term in the first instance. Finally, because of the increased financial risks undertaken by the lessor, higher credit quality is generally required to enter into a lease than to purchase a vehicle.\n\n"}

He was an organiser with the National Young Conservatives from 1965 to 1968. He is the Chairman of Wellingborough based BCC Marketing Services Ltd, the company he founded from 1988 to 2001, when it was liquidated by the company that had bought it in late 2001.\n\nBinley was the Parliamentary Agent for the Wyre Forest Conservative Association during the 1997 general election campaign. He was elected to Northamptonshire County Council in 1997, where he was a Cabinet Member. He was selected to contest the Labour-held the Parliamentary marginal seat of Northampton South, and defeated the sitting Labour MP Tony Clarke at the 2005 general election by over 4,000 votes. Binley made his maiden speech on 25 May 2005.\n\nHe was also a Northamptonshire County Councillor for Hackleton division but did not restand for the county council at elections held in 2009.\n\nBinley was re-elected in the 2010 general election, with an increased majority of 6,004.\n\nIn March 2012, Binley was reported as being one of the Conservative MPs to have spoken critically of Party Co-Chairman Sayeeda Warsi at a meeting of the 1922 Committee, following Lady Warsi's handling of Roger Helmer MEP's defection to UKIP and later called on her to resign saying she was guilty of \"self-destructive lunacy\".\nHe is also a critic of David Cameron calling on him to \"smell the coffee\" after the Conservatives faced a terrible defeat in the 2012 local elections and even criticised Number 10 more widely and their attitude towards Conservative backbenchers. He also criticised David Cameron's decision to hire Andy Coulson.\n\nBinley and his wife Jacquie have lived in the constituency for over 20 years, and have two grown sons. In 2006, he became the victim of identity theft, when someone tried to divert his bank statements and unsuccessfully attempted to steal £9,000 from him whilst he was in India. The perpetrator wrote to Binley boasting of his exploits.\n\nHe received a six-month driving ban in May 2007 having totted up 12 points on his licence when caught doing 37 mph in a 30 mph zone in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire. With nine points already, he was given three more and a ban by Towcester magistrates.\n\nIn January 2013, Binley revealed he was suffering from \"low-grade lymphoma affecting white blood cells\" and would undergo chemotherapy. In July 2013 Binley stated he would not stand again at the next general election in 2015.\n\nOn 17 June 2009 it was revealed that Binley had claimed over £50,000 in expenses, renting a flat from his own company, BCC Marketing. Two months after beginning to rent the flat, expenses rules were changed to clarify that MPs could no longer rent properties from businesses in which they had an interest. Binley appealed to the Speaker of the House Michael Martin, whilst still claiming for the flat. Binley lost his appeal after two and a half years, during which time he still claimed for the flat in question.

A member of the Democratic Party, he has served as the 37th Secretary of State of Illinois since 1999. He is the longest-serving and the first African American to hold this position. Previously, he served as the Cook County Recorder of Deeds from 1993 to 1999 and in the Illinois House of Representatives from 1975 to 1993.\n\nOn August 17, 2015, White announced that he would not seek reelection to a sixth term in 2018. Two years later in August, White reversed this decision and subsequently announced his candidacy for a sixth term. White has since announced that he will not seek reelection in 2022 for what would be a seventh term that would begin just six months short of his 89th birthday.\n\nIn 1959, White founded the Jesse White Tumbling Team to serve as a positive alternative for children residing in the Chicago area. Since its inception, more than 10,700 young men and women have performed with the team.\n\nWhite served as a paratrooper in the United States Army’s 101st Airborne Division and as a member of the Illinois National Guard. He played minor league professional baseball with the Chicago Cubs organization, which was followed by a 33-year career with the Chicago Public Schools system as a teacher and administrator.\n\nFirst elected to Secretary of State of Illinois in 1998, White was re-elected in 2002 by winning all 102 counties and garnering more than 2.3 million votes, the largest vote total by any candidate for Illinois statewide office in a quarter of a century. In 2006, White was re-elected to a third term, having received 63 percent of the vote statewide. White was elected to a fourth term in 2010, the leading vote-getter in the entire state.\n\nWhite has been an advocate on traffic safety issues. In 2007, he initiated teen driver safety legislation giving Illinois one of the top-ranked graduated driver licensing (GDL) programs in the country. In the first full year of the new law, teen fatal crashes in Illinois dropped by over 40 percent.\n\nWhite has also worked to crack down on DUI. He partnered with Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) on key DUI legislation. \n\nWhite continues to be an advocate for organ and tissue donation. He initiated legislation creating the First Person Consent Organ/Tissue Donor Registry, which makes a person's decision to donate legally binding. Since 2006, more than 5 million people have signed up for the registry.\n\nIn 1999, White inherited an office under a cloud of corruption from George H. Ryan. White immediately pledged to restore integrity and eliminate all forms of institutionalized corruption and wrongdoing. Some key efforts included: establishing a code of conduct for employees; setting strict fundraising policies that prohibit employee contributions; hiring Jim Burns, former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, as Inspector General and strengthened the Inspector General's office; and initiated legislation to make the position of Inspector General permanent with broad powers to root out corruption.\n\nThe Secretary of State's office administers library grants throughout the state. In 2010, White re-directed federal funds from the Illinois State Library so that local libraries throughout Illinois could maintain a revenue flow from the state despite the state's fiscal crisis.\n\nIn January 2009, White gained national attention for his decision to not certify Roland Burris's nomination to the United States Senate following corruption charges against former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. White steadfastly refused to co-sign a certificate of appointment for any appointee named by the governor, Blagojevich, who was arrested in part for trying to sell this very same senate seat. Burris then filed a lawsuit against White with the Illinois Supreme Court to compel him to certify the appointment as part of his routine administrative duties.\n\nOn January 9, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that White did not have to sign his name to any appointment made by Governor Rod Blagojevich. The Court further ruled that White had fulfilled his legal obligations regarding the appointment of Burris to the U.S. Senate by registering the appointment in accordance with state law. The document registered did not include White's signature or the State Seal. On January 12, the U.S. Senate officially seated Burris as Illinois’ junior senator.\n\nIn 1999 White was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame as a Friend of the Community.

Examples of his work are also included in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Brooklyn Art Museum, the Fort Worth Art Museum, Texas, the Smith College Museum of Art and the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\nBorn in Middlesbrough, Tillyer studied painting at the Middlesbrough College of Art from 1956 to 1959 before moving to London in the 1960s to study at the Slade School of Art, with painting as his main subject and printmaking as his subsidiary. There, he encountered William Coldstream and Anthony Gross, among others.\n\nIn 1959, Tillyer had two of his paintings – \"Painting\" and \"Sea, Clouds and Beach\" (both 1958) – accepted for the 'Young Contemporaries' exhibition, the tenth in a series of annual shows arranged to make public the best work done by students in England's art schools. The paintings were selected that year by Victor Pasmore, Terry Frost, Andrew Forge, Ceri Richards and William Turnbull.\n\nFollowing his time at the Slade, Tillyer took up a French Government Scholarship to study gravure under Stanley William Hayter, at Atelier 17 in Paris.

There he found a dense population of students, and a properly equipped print workshop. The pressure, though, was such that he spent much of his time in his room, making prints without a press. In 1963 he returned to England, and lived first in Notting Hill, in something close to abject poverty, and then in Middlesbrough.\n\nBy the later 1960s Tillyer was experimenting with constructed works with a conceptual basis, working on ideas of the grid and of the implied performative nature of hardware such as hinges and handles, he made works including Fifteen Drawer Pulls, 1966.\n\nTillyer began experimenting with printmaking in 1958, while a student at the Slade, and it was as a printmaker that he made his first reputation. He won international acclaim at the Second International Print Biennale in Kraków in 1968, and, the following year, found the support of Bernard Jacobson, who has been his dealer ever since. They met after Tillyer paid a visit to Jacobson, one of the leading print dealers and publishers in the country, in his office on Mount Street, Mayfair armed with a selection of his newest prints. Jacobson was enthusiastic and selected two for immediate publication, \"Mrs Lumsden's\" and \"The Large Birdhouse\".\n\nThe late 1960s saw a sudden explosion in the making and marketing of prints in Britain and generally in the Western world. International print exhibitions became regular events, some of them awarding major prizes. There was a new interest in prints as an art form, one that attracted a growing class of art-interested people not wealthy enough to collect unique paintings and sculpture. Finely edited and packaged suites and portfolios of prints, especially those produced by young and rising artists, were seen as attractive investments.\n\nTillyer's first major exhibition was held at Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol in 1970 and consisted of 33 etchings, three of which were immediately purchased by the British Council for its enterprising collection. With these prints, Tillyer used a variety of techniques, from etching to five tone screenprinting, to create lattices which through their gradation of tone depict what Pat Gilmour described as \"a cool and unpeopled world...in which to reflect the surrounding flux of nature.\"\nEncouraged by Tillyer's showing at the Arnolfini Gallery, Jacobson published a further four etchings, the \"Dry Lake\" suite. In 1971, 26 of his etchings were shown in the new Print Gallery within the Arts Council's Serpentine Gallery in London. Henceforth, with Jacobson marketing them, Tillyer's prints were seen and appreciated more widely. Other artists responded to them with enthusiasm, notably David Hockney, Sam Francis, Roy Lichtenstein, Ed Ruscha and Andy Warhol. From 1972 onwards, Tillyer's work has been shown regularly in group and solo exhibitions around the world.\n\nDuring 1975–76, while participating in an artist's a residency at Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, Tillyer began to use an idiosyncratic tall format for prints produced by diverse processes. He claimed at the time that the format echoed the tall window of his campus studio, and was confirmed for him by Chinese scroll paintings he saw in the university's gallery. Jacobson had asked him to contribute an image to a portfolio of new prints to be published in 1976 in celebration of the bicentenary of John Constable's birth; the other artists contributing included David Hockney, Robyn Denny and Richard Smith. Tillyer used this unfamiliar, anti-landscape format for an etching done in honour of Constable, \"For John Constable: The Cape, New England\"; it enabled him to keep his distance from the artist he was paying respect to. He used a large proportion of aquatint, apparently brushed on like watercolour. Evening light catches on clouds that fill the vertical slice of sky; at the bottom can be seen the sails of the Hampstead windmill that appears in certain Constable pictures. Its presence determines the scale of the whole, and presents a contrast between that one man-made detail, at the foot of the tall print, and the soft, delicate, but somewhat threatening swathes of lilac that almost fill the rest.\n\nThe \"Providence Prints\" (1976) is a suite of seven woodcuts and linocuts, using the same format but wholly different in technique, expression and subject. Exceptionally, Tillyer here allowed himself a variety of genres within a suite: landscape (waterfall), still like (the cylindrical vase with flowers), the human figure (two images of a nude posed indoors against a screen and a mirror). To each of the seven prints the Tillyer lattice makes major contributions, including in the figure images, where three or four lattices, cut with differing strengths and at varying scales, present floor, screen, background and the figures themselves. These may be echoes of Matisse's early figures, more obviously in the instance of the reclining figure, redolent as it is of the \"Blue Nude\" of 1907. The other, a standing figure, reflected in a mirror, her elbows raised as her hands meet behind her head, is likewise reminiscent of leftmost figure in Matisse's \"Le Bonheur de Vivre\" of 1905–06, a stock pose adapted from nineteenth-century academic painting.\n\nThe mid-1970s were a busy exhibiting period for Tillyer, but those years also show him reconstructing his professional image. Without playing down his prominence as a printmaker, he was eager to bring painting to the fore as his principal medium and vehicle of artistic expression. There followed a drastic reworking of the methods he had been using, and the images resulting from them, with Tillyer combining the canvas with a steel mesh ground, a bold decision without art historical precedent. In \"Blue Vase and Arrangement\" (1977–78), wire mesh occupies the centre and supplies the frame. The middle is occupied by the vase, which in turn is surrounded by colourful strokes and blotches: the nominal \"arrangement\" of flowers. These red, orange and green palimpsests burst forth from a dark, canvas ground, the jouissance of the flowers' colour being matched by the artist's self-consciously incongruous and witty identification of steel mesh with a ceramic vase.\n\nThere followed a second group of mesh paintings, which do away with the canvas altogether, made in 1979–80. Tillyer calls them the Mesh Works. Among the larger ones is \"Study for the House at Fontenay-aux-Roses by Way of the Admiral's House\" (1980), which was painted on an orthogonally positioned mesh of squares, collaged with bits of board front and back. There is thick paint on the mesh and thick paint on the boards, and these too come in primarily vertical and horizontal units. The white vertical form in the centre is not, this time, a vase, but a glimpse of a house amid foliage; to the left is a tall mottled green horizontal brushstroke, a poplar tree. The upper register, laden with bits of chipped wood panel assumes the form of a clear blue sky, and generally the scene is bathed in sunshine. A baroque gilt frame is hinted at on the right.\n\nTillyer would seem in this \"study\" to have tested how much and how little information would serve to convey his theme. He has expressed his interest in \"the tension between the artificial and the real\". Tillyer makes images—often, though not exclusively—with subjects derived from the natural world, which, through varying degrees of transformation, are turned into something essentially different: pictorially and materially. He tests, and ultimately expands, the limits of how far he is able to distance the artificial depiction from its real-world referent, without losing the reference itself, the point of this enterprise being to investigate and to demonstrate ever more fully the axiomatic contrivance and conceit implicit in the creation of all art.\n\nIn 1987, the Bernard Jacobson Gallery showed a selection of Tillyer's 'English Landscape Watercolours'. The title-page of the catalogue states: \"From April 1985 until March 1987, William Tillyer travelled throughout the British Isles and produces over 200 watercolours.\" Twenty-seven of these were exhibited and finely reproduced in the catalogue. Peter Fuller's thoughtful introduction raises a number of points. It outlines Tillyer's position vis-à-vis tradition and innovation: \"Tillyer's paintings depend, for their aesthetic effects, upon his responses to the world of nature; and yet, at the same time, his pictures do not offer a reproduction of the appearances of that world. Indeed, they seem to be deeply involved with that kind of questioning of the nature of the medium itself, so typical of late modernist concerns; Tillyer's painting in oil shows a characteristically self-critical doubt about the validity of illusion and representation, and a restless preoccupation with the nature of the picture plane, the support and the framing edge. Tillyer often seeks out 'radical' solutions, assaulting the surface, tearing, reconstituting, collaging.\" Fuller goes on to outline the history of English watercolour painting, associating Tillyer's use of the medium especially with the examples of Alexander Cozens and Thomas Girtin. He also stresses how Turner and others enlarged the effects achieved in it by \"roughing and scraping the surface of the paper\" and other such means, while Ruskin recommended the admixture of white to make watercolour opaque. Girtin, before Ruskin weighed in, had \"sought to 'purify' the practice of watercolour\" and made positive use of the whiteness of his chosen paper, together with delicate and also denser washes of colour. Fuller found this technique in Tillyer. He concludes: \"that in watercolours, and perhaps only in watercolours, the great cry of the Romantic aesthetic (i.e. 'Truth to Nature') and that of emergent Modernism (i.e. 'Truth to Materials') were, in effect, one and the same. For, when used in a way which preserved the particular qualities of the medium (even at the price of loss of immediate resemblance to the appearance of things) watercolour painting seemed to come closest to embodying the fragility, and elusive spontaneity, of our perceptions of nature itself.\" This, he adds, is what \"Tillyer seems to have understood so fully.\" Thus Tillyer appeared to be extending the researches of Ivon Hitchens and of Patrick Heron, Peter Lanyon and others associated with St Ives, fusing their response to nature, inherited from Romanticism, with the modern call for independent, often abstract image-making, guided by the doctrine of 'Truth to Materials'. In this, Fuller argues, we should recognise \"a quest for spiritual values\"; indeed this is a function of the continuing vitality of English landscape painting. Here Fuller makes good use of a quotation from Ruskin: \"The English tradition of landscape, culminating in Turner, is nothing other than a healthy effort to fill the void which the destruction of Gothic architecture has left.\" To this tradition belong, according to Fuller, \"Tillyer's best watercolours\" even as they declare their modernity: his response to nature is linked to \"the search for 'spiritual values'.\" Thus Tillyer is saved from what Fuller sees as late modern art's \"greatest weakness\": ending in \"aesthetic failure\" in pursuit of \"an abstract 'art of the real'.\" Tillyer's watercolours are beautiful in themselves. His gentle washes of colour tell us that our finest aesthetic feelings are intimately related to out experience of nature. Not to be aware of that which leads us \"to injustice and to exploit the natural world (and, indeed, each other).\" Tillyer's watercolours invite us to share with him a tentative and tremulous sensation of \"physical\" and \"spiritual\" oneness with the natural world.\n\nIn 1987 Tillyer bought some farm buildings in an isolated spot in North Yorkshire and put much effort into developing them as a home and workplace. It was here that he painted the \"Westwood\" series, a group of large-scale acrylic and oil paintings on canvas. There is an epic gravity about the works. The artist painted them using a broom head to deposit large arcs and commas of paint, keen to explore and exploit \"the physicality of the medium.\" These paintings overwhelm the viewer with their sheer visual presence, their muscular use of paint and the power of their formal and colour contrasts. Yet at the same time, according to Lynton, Tillyer seems to be stating something which \"comes perilously close to the thoughts of that famous piece of versifying: 'Poems are made by fools like me / But only god can make a tree.' Or: beware, this is only art; admire it, but know what you are admiring; do not use my paintings as a pretext for adoring nature.\" The implication here seems to be that while Tillyer could, had he wished, have created paintings which cajoled the viewer to bask in the pleasures that convincing landscape images provide, he elected not to, instead utilising a marked economy of means to suggest form, using, for example, only a single brushstroke to articulate a cloud, or the canopy of a tree, as in \"Untitled\" (1989). The \"Westwood\" paintings, sparse, yet Herculean in their vigour, insist on being blatantly synthetic; they declare their own artifice emphatically. Colours seem to lie on the very threshold of the picture plane, recession is implied very rarely, and patches of unpainted canvas abound. These are not landscapes, they cannot even accurately be termed depictions of them. This is Tillyer's version of the Verfremdungseffekt, Brecht's way of \"making strange\" lest his audiences should settle down into passive receptivity.\n\nMany forms and gesture recur. However, what Tillyer calls \"gestures\", a word redolent of the ostensibly intuitive actions of abstract expressionist painting, are in fact wholly deliberate. They need to be: their placing is exact and they can be huge. Their colour identifies their real-world referent, for example: (blue) sky, (white) cloud, (green) tree, (red) plant, (brown) earth and so on. Wide brushes are used to pick up more than one colour or tone. Thus in the same form might be found green, mingled with yellow or brown. In \"Green Landscape with Tree and Cloud\" (1989), a broad blue arc is partly covered by a black curve, and this in turn is overlaid with a shorter stroke in brilliant white, the topmost lateral edge of which is yellow, indicating a Tillyer cloud. In many places colours nestle within other colours, to suggest form, in this way.\n\nThe \"Living in Arcadia\" paintings were made in Yorkshire in 1990–91. In them, writes David Cohen, Tillyer \"juxtaposes the organic and the geometric, the gestural and the rational, the empirical (felt, observed) and the ideal (thought, imposed).\" These dualities are certainly there, and patent once we look for them. But the way he explores them makes it dangerous to attribute standard qualities to them: nothing is ever quite what it seems. Certainly they are \"organic\" and \"geometric\": these adjectives are clear enough. \"Gestural\", however, implies that the forms are not planned and thought-out, which axiomatically they are. Tillyer deploys pictorial rhetoric masterfully, using forms that look spontaneous and emotive with the same deliberation as geometric forms. Tillyer observes nature, but he also observes mankind's work. The world of design is as much within his remit as the world of nature, and \"design\" here includes aspects of modern and old-master art that could well be labelled \"ideal\". His process is constructive as well as deconstructive. In paintings such as \"Square Form\" (1990), we see him assembling forms and marks in a considered way. The work's form betrays the artist's process, which involves clear thought before and during its creation. The canvas is square and white. In its lower left corner is a black square, its sides uneven, a blue parallelogram apparently rising from either behind or above it, the bottom edge of which seems to fade away. All the other forms are gestural, and yet their clear, crisp outlines would appear to belie the artist's ostensibly spontaneous mark-making. Organic yet geometric; gestural yet rational.\n\nTillyer's presentation of elements which speak of nature together with elements that speak of human manufacture and human logic has been in his art from the first: two sorts of reality, linked because nature too adheres to logical processes and by the fact that we live in an environment made up of both. His habit of interrupting our reception of his images was born out of his desire to stop us mistaking art's artificial procedures and results as reality—that is to say, as a persuasive representation of something real. Here we get to the point of the series. The title, \"Living in Arcadia\" refers to two pictures by the classical French Baroque painter Nicolas Poussin. Their original titles are uncertain now. They are often labeled \"Et in Arcadia ego\" (1627/1637–38), in itself an ambiguous phrase, that is perhaps best translated: \"I too lived in Arcadia\". In both versions, shepherds examine a sarcophagus. The implication is that they have just discovered the stone monument and, having read its portentous epitaph, are pictured in the process of comprehending its significance. Even in Arcadia, that idyllic pastoral land associated with perfect well-being, death rules. Poussin's humans and the sarcophagus make for an unambiguous contrast: they and their natural environment live, while \"it\" speaks of death. Tillyer's series engages broadly with the same idea. His coloured forms may refer to nature, but he shows us quite clearly that they are merely acrylic (and therefore artificial) pigments, applied to panel – not natural and not alive – while the nominal \"square form\" is perhaps his equivalent to Poussin's man-made tomb.\n\nWhen Tillyer's \"Fearful Symmetries\" series was shown at the Bernard Jacobson Gallery in 1993, the catalogue reprinted an article Martin Gaylord had written a few weeks earlier. Gayford visited Tillyer in Yorkshire, and discussed with him his ideas about nature and landscape and his thoughts concerning watercolour painting, his own and his most important predecessors', Alexander and John Robert Cozens, Turner, Cotman etc. The first months of 1993 saw a large exhibition of 'The Great Age of British Watercolours' at the Royal Academy, and it made good sense to get Tillyer's response to this on the way to focusing on his own use of the medium. Tillyer declared his interest in the founders of this 'great age', and distanced himself from the elaborately worked watercolours of the mid-Victorians, done, as he said, to compete with oil paintings but essentially unable to. \"Each medium has its own nature. It's what you're saying with the medium that's important.\" He emphasised the originality, the modernity, of the past painters he admired, and also his personal aversion to making topographical portraits of selected landscapes. But he also stressed the affinity of watercolours to the British landscape, and vice versa: \"Around here moisture appears actually to rise out of the ground, out of the earth. It almost feels as if the sky is being formed from the earth – a rising of moisture into the void of the sky. Watercolour is almost the very nature of landscape in itself, its own properties. Landscape is simply weather – air and water... To my mind, the pure use of watercolour involved starting from white paper, and then gradually working back – so that any light and air you want in the piece is the first mark you make.\" About the new series of paintings Gayford said very little. It was primarily Tillyer's watercolours he had gone to discuss, in the context both of 'the great age' and of Tillyer's thoughts about nature and about the Romantic/classical duality signalled so firmly in the \"Westwood\" and \"Living in Arcadia\" paintings. The new paintings were being prepared for their trip to London. Gayford mentioned the contrast each of them offered, the \"rather jarring opposition\" between the natural forms, usually on the right, and the geometrical forms, usually on the left, now made as cuts into the canvas-on-board front plane. He rightly emphasised both that contrast, which seemed to him like \"a contest, even a battle\", and the resolution of the two elements on the conceptual level, since nature's forms too are structured mathematically. He also explained Tillyer's use of the series title, \"Fearful Symmetries\". The words echo William Blake's, in his poem \"The Tyger\", but Tillyer says he took them from the title of a piece of music by the American composer John Adams. In many respects the new series continues methods and images initiated in the \"Living in Arcadia\" series. However, the new series, produced in 1992–93 is more concentrated, in that all the paintings have the same format and dimensions (36 x 42 inches), and are all set into the characteristic Tillyer timber frame, painted in various blue-greys. \"Ayton\" (1993), for example, is painted on uninterrupted canvas, sans wire mesh and sans planar recession, in thinned acrylic over white and could almost be a watercolour, a suitably delicate response to light and air.\n\nIn the autumn of 1994 Tillyer showed his next series, the \"Kachina\" paintings, at André Emmerich's gallery in New York. The catalogue appends a Tillyer text, 'some Brief Notes'; the introduction is by Martin Gayford. In it, Tillyer writes about the Italian Renaissance as, for all its positive achievements, a deleterious episode in the long history of art: \"The \"Kachina\" paintings... may also be seen as a visual essay on the relation of illusion to reality... of the Renaissance ideal of spatial illusionism to the Byzantine concept of the object. The failure in the 15th century to couple the new Renaissance concepts of perspective and illusionistic space with those of Byzantium made for a lost opportunity. It is only in the 20th century that this failure has begun to be redressed.\" For the art historian this raises all sorts of difficulties, but the underling truth in what Tillyer outlines was known to the great innovators of Modern art, to Gauguin and Cézanne especially, as is shown by their efforts to abandon not only academic illusionism but also the illusionism of tone and colour still purveyed by Impressionism, in favour of a new flatness and formal, as opposed to naturalistic, rightness; also known to Matisse, Kandinsky, Malevich etc., who gave priority to the demands of the pictorial object and of their media. The Cubism of Picasso and Braque was, among other things, a dialectical treatment of the opposition to which Tillyer refers. And surely by at the very latest 1950, roughly the time when Matisse made his great paper cut-out compositions, and Pollock his finest drip works, the Albertian tradition of the tabula quadrata as a window on to reality had been set aside, countered by something equally powerful. Tilyer, however, takes this rejection further still. It is one thing for Pollock to substitute for perspective and tonal modelling the material reality of paint and colour and the brushstroke as visual fact. It is quite another to change the language of painting altogether, fracturing its traditional logic by introducing other, conventionally incongruous media, as in Tillyer's substitution of the canvas for a wire lattice in his earlier Mesh works.\n\nThe \"Kachina\" paintings likewise make reference to unconventional media: the kachina dolls made by the Native America Hopi tribe. The kachina doll, writes Tillyer in the catalogue, is \"icon-like,\" and provided him \"with a vehicle to explore the dialogue between nature seen romantically and the geometry of man-made forms\" to which the series (and much of his earlier work) makes reference. Kachna dolls are at once figurative and geometrical; in them \"gesture counters geometry.\" The forms of the paintings are themselves taken from the dolls, most obviously the blue ratchet-edged insectile biomorph that in \"Blue Ogre\" (1994) appears to devour the green and yellow comma-like gestures around which it curves. Though almost every painting in the series is vertical and many of them present dominant forms – \"gestures\" – of this sort, the artist has remarked: \"They are all landscapes. All the paintings are kachinas, but most could just as well be given the title \"Landscape with Ruins\".\" This refers to Tillyer's use of the type of landscape inherited from, primarily, Poussin. In the \"Westwood\" and \"Living in Arcadia\" paintings, we saw him knotting and fusing his pictorial signs for nature into quite concise clusters, operating as emblems more than as glimpses of landscape. Now he uses parts and aspects of the dolls in addition to Poussin's geometric and stereometric forms in his internal debate on the nature of art. This becomes more assertive than before, more up-front, less implicit. It is partly that the images themselves are so insistent. Big forms, on the surface as paint, run swiftly from top to bottom, sometimes organic and gestural, or else hard and geometric, flat and voluminous, relief and planar. They attempt to deal with the artist's strongly felt ideas about landscape and the nature of painting: of the eternal struggle between artifice and reality implicit in the creation, consumption and ontology of all art.\n\nThe verticality of most of the \"Kachina\" paintings, together with their compositions, which are usually firmly centred, gives them an almost figurative presence: something stands there, emerging from the tenebrous canvas ground beneath. But there are exceptions. \"Heart of the Sky: Orange Heaven\" (1994) is the only horizontal canvas in the series. It presents a dark Tillyer landscape, sliced open in the middle in the shape of a slightly asymmetrical diabolo (a sharply waisted cylinder). The back plane is black, so deep as to be almost luminous, and set against it we see most of what we take to be a bright red rectangle. The black and the red are so positive that they seem to shine out from this carved recess, overwhelming the landscape to which they play background.\n\nThe 21st century saw Tillyer return to making constructed works and painting on mesh much as he did in the 1960s and 70s. In the early 2000s he began work on the Hardware Variations a series of works which included door handles and unusual materials such as glass and fabric. He followed this up with the Farrago constructs in 2004, large scale sculptural constructions of wood, paint and straps and ratchets. \nIn 2010 a major monograph on his watercolours was published by 21 Publishing covering almost 40 years of his practise. In the extensive text American art critic and poet John Yau writes: \"However beautiful they are, and many of them are extremely beautiful, almost painfully so, Tillyer's watercolours never lead us away in favour of an Edenic vision.\"\n\nIn 2013 Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art in Middlesbrough MIMA held the first major retrospective exhibition of Tillyer's work since 1996.\n\nIn late 2017, Bernard Jacobson announced in the Art Newspaper that he would be filling most of his 2018 exhibition schedule with shows dedicated to Tillyer, launching \"five separate exhibitions incorporating new and historic works by the Middlesbrough-born artist.\" Jacobson, who has been Tillyer's dealer since 1969, stated: \"He was an unknown then, and I’ve stayed loyal to him since. I consider him the heir to Constable through Cézanne and Matisse. He is an intensely private man who is completely outside the system, and I’m keen to set the record straight.\"\n\nIn 2018 Tillyer made his largest work to date, The Golden Striker, a free hanging 9 metre work of 5 panels of acrylic mesh in which the paint seems to be woven through the image, Tillyer describes these paintings as Tapestry paintings.\n\n"}
{"id": "1959240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1959240", "title": "Daniel Steibelt", "text": "Daniel Steibelt\n\nDaniel Gottlieb Steibelt (October 22, 1765) was a German pianist and composer. His main works were composed in Paris and in London, and he died in Saint Petersburg, Russia.\n\nDaniel Steibelt was born in Berlin, and studied music with Johann Kirnberger before being forced by his father to join the Prussian Army. Deserting, he began a nomadic career as a pianist before settling in 1790 in Paris, where he attained great popularity as a virtuoso by means of a piano sonata called \"La Coquette\", which he composed for Marie Antoinette. Also in Paris, his dramatic opera entitled \"Romeo et Juliette\", which was later highly regarded by Hector Berlioz, was produced at the Théâtre Feydeau in 1793. This is held by many to be his most original and artistically successful composition.\n\nSteibelt began to share his time between Paris and London, where his piano-playing attracted great attention. In 1797 he played in a concert of J. P. Salamon. In 1798 he produced his Concerto No. 3 in E containing a \"Storm Rondo\" characterized by extensive tremolos, which became very popular. In the following year Steibelt started on a professional tour in Germany; and, after playing with some success in Hamburg, Berlin, Dresden, and Prague, he arrived at the end of March 1800 at Vienna, where he is reported to have challenged Beethoven to a trial of skill at the house of Count Moritz von Fries. The oft-quoted account by Ferdinand Ries was written 37 years later; Ries did not attend it and became only later a student and friend of Beethoven. Ries describes how Beethoven carried the day by improvising at length on a theme taken from the cello part of a new Steibelt piece, placed upside down on the music rack. Reportedly, Steibelt stormed out of the room, never to set foot in Vienna again. Ries' account, however, contains two factual errors.\n\nFollowing this supposed public humiliation Steibelt would have quit his tour. (The date of his departure from Vienna is not known, while Beethoven did leave Vienna at the end of April or beginning of May: he played in Buda, Hungary, on 7 May.) Steibelt went again to Paris, where he organised the first performance of Joseph Haydn's oratorio \"The Creation\", which took place on 24 December 1800 at the Opera House. On his way to it, the First Consul Bonaparte narrowly escaped a bomb attack. Steibelt had just published one of his most accomplished sonatas, which he had dedicated to Bonaparte's wife, Josephine. After a second stay in England from March 1802 to March 1805, Steibelt returned to the continent, gave concerts in Brussels (April 1805), and was back in Paris in Summer. He celebrated Napoleon's triumph at Austerlitz with a \"Musical Interlude\" named \"La Fête de Mars\", whose première was attended by Napoleon in person (4 February 1806).\n\nIn 1808 he was invited by Tsar Alexander I to Saint Petersburg, succeeding François-Adrien Boieldieu as director of the French Opera in 1811. He remained there for the rest of his life. In 1812, he composed \"The Conflagration of Moscow\", a grand fantasy for piano dedicated to the Russian nation. Steibelt generally ceased performing in 1814, but returned to the platform for his Concerto No. 8, which was premiered on March 16, 1820, in Saint Petersburg, and is notable for its choral finale. This was four years before Beethoven's unconventional Symphony No. 9, and was the only piano concerto ever written (excluding Beethoven's Choral Fantasy) with a part for a chorus until Henri Herz's 6th concerto, Op. 192 (1858) and Ferruccio Busoni's Piano Concerto (1904). Steibelt died in Saint Petersburg on September 20, 1823, following a prolonged illness.\n\nBesides his dramatic music, Steibelt left behind him an enormous number of compositions, mostly for the piano. His playing was said to be brilliant, though lacking the higher qualities which characterized that of such contemporaries as Cramer and Muzio Clementi. Despite this, his playing and compositional skills enabled him to build a career across Europe. Grove describes him as \"extraordinarily vain, arrogant, discourteous, recklessly extravagant and even dishonest.\" Such harsh moral judgements are justified by some of the facts of Steibelt's life as they have come down to us. These and similar attacks on his character must be viewed with caution if a correct image of Steibelt's personality is to be reconstructed.\n\nAt his best Steibelt was an imaginative composer with strong individuality. His operas \"Cendrillon\" (1810) and \"Romeo et Juliette\" (1793), all his piano concerti, his chamber music, a selection of his numerous sonatas (e.g. Op. 45 in E-flat and Op. 64 in G) and some piano pieces (caprices and preludes, studies Op. 78) are of a sufficient musical worth to be performed and enjoyed today.\n\n1) Stage\n\n2) Orchestral\n\n3) Chamber\n\n4) Methode de Pianoforte (1805)\n\n5) Songs\n\n\n\n"}

His greatest achievement came in 1972, when he won the French Open and he remains the oldest first-time Grand Slam champion of the Open era at 34 years of age.\n\nAndrés came from a family which loved tennis, and his father Esteban supported his efforts to play the game. Esteban had been a good tennis player and he became Andres' coach. They practiced at Real Club de Tenis Barcelona. At an early age Andres started to become a really good tennis player, winning some important tournaments in his region. At age sixteen, he won the U-18 Championship of Spain. In 1954, he won the Championship of Spain in the doubles category playing with Juan Manuel Couder. At the same time, he stopped studying to focus on his tennis career.\n\nHe was not only a successful tennis player in Spain, but also represented his country throughout Europe. He played in the Galea's Cup, the European Championship U21, and won it in 1956 and 1957. He was the runner-up in 1958. After that, he decided to go to Australia to play with the man who was considered the best tennis coach in the world, Harry Hopman. He improved his tennis level and soon, he had two important victories in the championships in Perth and in Sydney.\n\nGimeno went back to Spain in 1960 where he then had his best year as an amateur, winning the titles in Barcelona, Caracas, Monte Carlo, and at Queen's Club. In Barcelona, he became the first Spanish player to win the Torneo Conde de Godó, beating the Italian player Giuseppe Merlo. That same year he reached the doubles final of the French Open too, losing to an Australian duo. After that year, he joined the professional group World Championship Tennis, where Jack Kramer offered him $50,000 for three years, and more money for each victory. The group consisted of some of the best tennis players in history such as Rod Laver, Pancho Gonzalez, Ken Rosewall. Gimeno won the World Championship in 1966, beating Rod Laver in five sets and the same tournament in doubles. He also won the Netherlands Open, the Madison Square Garden's Championship in 1969, the Dakar and Hamburg in 1971.\n\nHis best Grand Slam results as a singles player came in 1968 when the Open era started and the professional could participate in Grand Slams. His first good result was the final in Australian Open in 1969, where he lost to Rod Laver in three sets.\n\nGimeno's best year was in 1972, when he was a finalist in Brussels and in Paris, and he won in Los Angeles, in Eastbourne, in Gstaad, and the French Open. The Catalan won his first and only Grand Slam in 1972. He holds the record for the oldest male player to win the French Open (at the age of 34). In the final, he beat the French player Patrick Proisy in four sets. In addition, he reached the semifinals at Wimbledon in 1970. In 1973, he reached the final of the Dutch Open in Hilversum, where Tom Okker beat him in five sets.\n\nGimeno was an active Davis Cup player, recording an 18–5 singles record and 5–5 doubles record. His debut was in the match that Spain played against Egypt with one of the most important players in Spain, Manuel Santana. He could not play the competition while he was a part of the professional group, but he participated as coach in 1966. In 1973, he injured his meniscus and decided to quit playing tennis. He became the tennis coach in the RFET, Tennis’ Spanish Federation and then in the Suisse Federation.\n\nAfter his professional career, he decided to join the tennis circuit for retired players called Legends Championship. He also founded a tennis club in 1974 called \"Club de Tenis Andres Gimeno\" in Castelldefels, Barcelona.\n\nHe was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2009, becoming the fourth Spanish tennis player in it, after Arantxa Sánchez Vicario, Manuel Alonso and Manuel Santana.\n\nGimeno married Cristina Corolla in 1962 and together they had three children: Alejo Gimeno, Andres Gimeno Jr. and Cristina Gimeno. In 2011, Gimeno lost all his money, and some of the best Spanish tennis players such as Rafael Nadal, Tommy Robredo, Feliciano López and David Ferrer played an exhibition tennis tournament in Palau Blaugrana to raise funds for him.\n\nGimeno died following a long illness, on 9 October 2019, at the age of 82.\n\n\nSource: ATP\n\nSource:\n\n"}

The licensing authority, however, was not quite ready so that in 1988, three plays with gay themes were banned from being performed. These were Eleanor Wong's \"Jackson on a Jaunt\", Chay Yew's \"As If He Hears\" and Russell Heng's \"Lest The Demons Get To Me\". The first two plays were subsequently staged in 1989/1990 after negotiations with the authority. The third was staged in 1992 after Singapore's culture policy was liberalised by its new Prime Minister, Goh Chok Tong.\n\nThe following are some of the local theatre productions which have featured cross-dressing or LGBT themes:\n\n\"M Butterfly\" is an internationally acclaimed theatre piece by Chinese-American playwright David Hwang about a transvestite male opera star’s deceptive seduction of an unsuspecting French male diplomat in China. It was staged during the 1990 Singapore Arts Festival in the wake of the proscription of three gay-themed plays just two years earlier, probably to symbolise newly appointed Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's vision of a \"kinder and gentler Singapore\". It also marked the first instance of total nudity in Singapore theatre. The impact was heightened by the local media which, habitually sensitised to the political climate, highlighted members of the political élite seated in the front row taking in the spectacle with cultured nonchalance.\n\nThe matriarch in most of Gunung Sayang Association's Peranakan plays is played by a man, akin to theatre in Shakespearean times. Nyonya women were not encouraged to perform in front of an audience.\n\nThe most popular male cross-dressing matriarch to have performed in these plays was GT Lye, whose baju panjangs were made by Aljunied Brothers at Arab Street.\n\nKenny Chan is a comedic performer from Melaka who has also played the matriarch role and is known for what some consider rather crude stand-up comedy acts. Chan was most recently seen as Romeo in the TV12 series, \"The Ways of the Matriarch\".\n\nExamples of Peranakan plays which featured a male cross-dressing matriarch include:\n\n\n\n\"Invitation to Treat\" was a month-long trilogy of plays performed at the Jubilee Hall, Raffles Hotel in April 2003. They were penned by acclaimed playwright and academic lawyer Eleanor Wong and produced by W!LD RICE, a professional theatre company founded by well-regarded Artistic Director Ivan Heng.\n\nThe three plays of \"Invitation To Treat\" spanned 20 years in the life of their protagonist, Ellen Toh, following her journey towards self-discovery and self-actualisation. She was a smart, ambitious and hardworking lesbian lawyer who married her best friend in a 'marriage of convenience' that presented her with the best of both worlds– a socially respectable position, and a husband who accepted her sexual orientation.\n\nThe plays swept the audience along a unique and enjoyable journey, an Odyssey of insights which recounted the story of one member of an invisible minority who struggled with her sexuality and, over time, grew increasingly confident and self-aware, with more than a little help from her friends. Heng hoped that the LGBT community would relate to the plays which included 'insider' jokes and references that could only be fully appreciated by the gay community, with scripts that were not dumbed down to accommodate a straight audience. Owing to its lesbian theme, the producers experienced great difficulty in securing a corporate sponsor.\n\n\"Mergers & Accusations\" and \"Wills & Secession\" ran as a double bill from 2 to 6 April 2003.\n\nThe play \"Private Parts\" was premiered at the 1992 Singapore Arts Festival, generating a buzz that lasted well past its two sell-out seasons, both during the festival and its immediate rerun, when it played to an estimated audience of 20,000.\n\nMany felt that \"Private Parts\" was popular playwright Michael Chiang’s best play to date; definitely, it was his most politicised. The man who defined Singapore comedy with runaway hits like \"Army Daze, Beauty World\" and \"Mixed Signals\", surprised many with this pointed yet poignant piece of writing.\n\nPushing the envelope the way no other local production had ever done, \"Private Parts\" was a play many agree was ahead of its time. One gets involved with a talk-show host who soon finds out the true meaning of reality TV. One gets a glimpse of the brutality of media competition: how far would one go for higher ratings? Plus, for a nation of gawkers weaned on the night-time beauties of Bugis Street back in the 60s, here was an up-close peek into that mysterious world of drag queens. What more could one want from theatre in the rigid, pre-RA days of Singapore?\n\nHype aside, \"Private Parts\" made news because it was able to engross even the most conservative of audiences with its bittersweet (and unexpectedly moving) story about 3 transsexuals trying to find their place in life. Way before Hollywood was fêted for daring to do the same by putting Terence Stamp, Guy Pearce and Hugo Weaving in heels and makeup for \"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\" (1994). Not to mention Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo donning even bigger bouffants and bosoms in \"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything\" (1995).\n\nThe story: Briefly, a Star Search winner fronts a current-affairs talk show to improve ratings. His life turns upside down when he ends up in a sex-change clinic with 3 transsexuals. After befriending them, he tries to get them on his show.\n\nPrivate Parts proved to be such an audience favourite that it was revived in 1995 for another run, this time including a Mandarin version (which starred Edmund Chen and the late comedian Hua Liang) as well.\n\nAnd 12 years on, Michael Chiang’s much-acclaimed play returned to the Singapore stage for a limited season. The new, updated production had its run at the Esplanade Theatre from 28 July to 1 August 2004.\n\nA unique one-woman show on 17 and 18 June 2005 by Parinya Charoenphol, also familiarly known in Thai as Nong Thoom. The famous former Muay Thai (kickboxing) champion who stunned the world with her gender change invited the audience into her colourful world where strength meets beauty, fight meets dance and heart meets mind.\n\nA one-woman monologue written by poet Cyril Wong and performed by Elizabeth de Roza on 23 June 2005 at The Substation Dance Studio.\n\nIt world-premiered on 3 June 2005 at the Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall. Written as a special dedication to Toy Factory's 15th anniversary and directed by award-winning director Goh Boon Teck, it recounted a period 5,000 years ago when five ill-fated beauties were impeached for their tramped existence. Spirits unveiled five untold stories of Sai Jing Hua from the Qing dynasty, an infamous prostitute, Bao Si from the Zhou dynasty, the concubine who never smiled, Lu Hou from the Han dynasty, the revengeful empress, Ya Zuan Ji from the Tang dynasty, a poetic priestess and Ke Shi Ming from the Ming dynasty, the Great Madam, all of whom were despised and condemned by Chinese historians.\n\nGoh collaborated with playwright Xu Sheng Liang (China) and music composer Saidah Rastam (Malaysia) to reinterpret Chinese opera and its heritage in a different ensemble. Together, they breathed contemporary life into traditional Chinese opera whilst retaining its beauty.\n\nIt was crafted as a musical, infusing 5 different forms of Chinese opera, namely Yue, Jing, Li Yuan, Huang Mei and Yu, with contemporary funk. No traditional opera musical instruments or props were employed in this unconventional fusion. Instead, there were 4 actors, 5 martial artistes, 7 musicians, 1 saxophonist and 5 genres of opera in this creative mix.\n\nSpirits advanced Chinese opera a step forward, creating a new theatre platform for the younger generation. Multimedia effects and high-tech neon swords replaced traditional props. An outrageous wardrobe dazzled and a fascinating mobile stage transported the audience to another world.\n\nThe constantly challenged notion of masculinity in Asia has unfortunately led to the near extinction of opera female impersonators. Toy Factory proudly featured 5 of these professional 'Nan Hua Dan' from Singapore and China, which made the musical drama all the more gripping.\n\nA project by Richard Chua, after \"Lover's Words\", about heterosexuals in a homosexual society. It was an extension of Chua's belief that life should be led honestly and truthfully. In his quest to further meditate on love between people (in this case, among three boys in their 20s), Chua embarked on this project to push his collaborators to work in a space where they had nowhere to go, but to clean. Cleaning was an essential task that would bring these boys to the next phase of eternity.\n\nThe story was about love - love that seemed to be defined differently by different people, with different perspectives, resulting in different outcomes. Each boy had a love story to tell.\n\n\nThe following theatre companies have been active in staging plays which examine LGBT issues:\n\n"}
{"id": "1959263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1959263", "title": "Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act", "text": "Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act\n\nThe Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act or FACTA, ) is a United States federal law, passed by the United States Congress on November 22, 2003, and signed by President George W. Bush on December 4, 2003, as an amendment to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The act allows consumers to request and obtain a free credit report once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide consumer credit reporting companies (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion). In cooperation with the Federal Trade Commission, the three major credit reporting agencies set up the web site AnnualCreditReport.com to provide free access to annual credit reports.\n\nThe act also contains provisions to help reduce identity theft, such as the ability for individuals to place alerts on their credit histories if identity theft is suspected, or if deploying overseas in the military, thereby making fraudulent applications for credit more difficult. Further, it requires secure disposal of consumer information.\n\nThe FACT Act contains seven major titles: Identity Theft Prevention and Credit History Restoration, Improvements in Use of and Consumer Access to Credit Information, Enhancing the Accuracy of Consumer Report Information, Limiting the Use and Sharing of Medical Information in the Financial System, Financial Literacy and Education Improvement, Protecting Employee Misconduct Investigations, and Relation to State Laws.\n\nThis title of the act contains provisions that deal mainly with the prevention of identity theft. In particular, it establishes new regulations concerning 'fraud alerts' and 'active duty alerts', establishes new limitations on the printing of customers' credit card numbers on receipts, and prescribes that new regulations be established by certain government agencies regarding the detection of identity theft by financial institutions and creditors.\n\nThe title requires that consumer reporting agencies, upon the request of a consumer who believes he is or about to be a victim of fraud or any other related crime, must place a fraud alert on that consumer's file for at least 90 days, and notify all other consumer reporting agencies of the fraud alert.\n\nConsumers may request an extended fraud alert, in which case requires the reporting agency to disclose this fraud alert in any credit score that it issues for the consumer during a seven-year period. An extended alert also requires the reporting agency to exclude the consumer from any list distributed to third parties for the purpose of extending credit or offering insurance to that consumer.\n\nThe title also provides for any active duty member to request an active duty alert, which requires the reporting agency to disclose such alert with any credit report issued within 12 months of the request and to exclude the active duty member from any list distributed to third parties for the purpose of extending credit or offering insurance for two years from the request.\n\nThe act also prohibits businesses from printing more than five digits of any customer's card number or card expiration date on any receipt provided to the cardholder at the point of sale or transaction. This provision is enforced with statutory damages ranging from $100 to $1000 per violation, and when claims are aggregated in a class action (brought by all the customers of a retailer that failed to truncate credit card numbers) the amount of damages can be massive. The provision excludes receipts that are handwritten or imprinted, where the only method of recording the credit card number is by such means. The act did not become effective for three years after its enactment for any cash register manufactured before January 1, 2005 and did not become effective for one year after its enactment for any cash register manufactured after January 1, 2005.\n\nThe act established the Red Flags Rule, which required the federal banking agencies, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Federal Trade Commission to jointly create regulations regarding identity theft prevention applicable to financial institutions and creditors. The Red Flags Rule also addresses how card issuers must respond to changes of address. Regulations that were established as a result include:\n\n\nAnother key item was the requirement that mortgage lenders provide consumers with a Credit Disclosure Notice that included their credit scores, range of scores, credit bureaus, scoring models, and factors affecting their scores. This form is typically available from credit reporting agencies, and many will send this directly to the consumer on the lenders' behalf.\n\nFinancial institutions faced a mandatory deadline of November 1, 2008, to comply with the Red Flags Rule, section 114 and 315 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions (FACT) Act. However, due to widespread confusion over coverage under the act, specifically whether the term \"creditor\" applies to particular businesses, members of Congress repeatedly requested that FTC postpone the deadline for compliance with Section 315 until after December 31, 2010.\n\nAccording to a Business Alert issued by the Federal Trade Commission in June 2008, the Red Flags Rule applies to a very broad list of businesses including \"financial institutions\" and \"creditors\" with \"covered accounts\". A \"creditor\" is defined to include \"lenders such as banks, finance companies, automobile dealers, mortgage brokers, utility companies and telecommunications companies\". However, this is not an all-inclusive list.\n\nThe regulations apply to all businesses that have \"covered accounts\". A \"covered account\" includes any account for which there is a foreseeable risk of identity theft. For example, credit cards, monthly billed accounts like utility bills or cell phone bills, social security numbers, drivers license numbers, medical insurance accounts, and many others. This significantly expands the definition to include all companies, regardless of size, that maintain, or otherwise possess, consumer information for a business purpose. Because of the broad definitions in these regulations, few businesses will be able to escape these requirements.\n\nProvisions in this title require that the Federal Trade Commission, in consultation with the Federal banking agencies and the National Credit Union Agency, \"prepare a model summary of the rights of consumers ... with respect to the procedures for \nremedying the effects of fraud or identity theft...\". Beginning sixty days after the summary of these rights were established, all reporting agencies are required to provide a copy of this summary to any consumer that contacts an agency and states that he believes he has been a victim of fraud or identity theft.\n\nThe Act also allows requires any reporting agency to block the reporting of any information in a consumer's file that the consumer identifies as information that originated from an alleged identity theft. Such agency must block the information within four days of receiving proof, a copy of an identity theft report, the identification of the information by the consumer, and a statement from the consumer that the information is not a result of any transaction he participated in.\n\nAgencies are not required to block any information (and may rescind any existing blocks) in the case that the block was found to be made in error or based on erroneous information as provided by the consumer, or that the consumer \"obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions.\n\nThis section requires that all consumer reporting agencies develop a means of communicating to each other consumer complaints regarding fraud or identity theft, or requests for fraud alerts or blocks. Furthermore, the section requires that each consumer reporting agency release a report each year to the Federal Trade Commission of fraud alert requests and complaints involving fraud or identity theft received by the reporting agency. Finally, the section requires the Federal Trade Commission to set up a means by which consumers can contact the reporting agencies and creditors with a complaint involving identity theft or fraud.\n\nAfter its enactment, some consumer advocacy groups criticized the FACT Act claiming that it preempts some stricter and already-existing state regulations, and provides exceptions that are 'far too generous' to new regulations regarding disclosure of personal information by banks as found in the act. Furthermore, an article in The Washington Post criticized the difficulty in retrieving the credit reports in some of the states that were first eligible under the act.\n\nVermont, Colorado, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and California had all established laws by 1994 requiring credit bureaus to provide a free credit report on demand. However, according to U.S. Pirg, \"[w]ith the FACT Act, the financial industry won its primary goal: permanent preemption of stronger state credit and privacy laws.\" Specifically, state laws are preempted in certain areas, such as the content of a consumer report, the responsibilities of \"furnishers\", responses of consumer reporting agencies to disputes over inaccurate information (although there is an exception for statutes in place before 1996), and duties of those who take an adverse action based on a report.\n\nAn article dated March 13, 2005 and published in the Washington Post stated that while \"[r]esidents of six East Coast states—Maryland, Georgia, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Vermont—are already eligible for free reports from all three agencies as a result of state laws\", the phone numbers provided to request these reports connected to automated systems that the article described as \"maddening in their complexity and unforgiving if your circumstances vary from the system's programming.\" Furthermore, the article criticised automated systems for forcing consumers to \"navigate a thicket of recorded information -- including sales pitches for their products, such as a credit 'score' (an evaluation of your creditworthiness) or a 'monitoring' service to help guard against identity theft\". Since 2012, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has published a list of consumer reporting agencies (CRAs). It enables consumers to see which CRAs might be important to them and gives them the contact information of each CRA in the list, so consumers can more easily order their personal consumer reports. Many of the CRAs in the list provide personal reports to consumers for free. The 2016 edition of the list is available on the CFPB's website here.\n\nAs the Red Flag rule widely defines creditors, many businesses (such as utilities) are now required to collect personal information (such as SSN and driver's license numbers) that they do not need and have no use for. This policy is precisely contrary to the FTC's advice to consumers that they should disclose their social security number to companies only when absolutely necessary. This aspect of the Red Flag rule has the unintended consequences of increasing the number of businesses that hold consumers' Social Security numbers, thereby putting consumers at greater risk for identity theft through data theft.\n\n"}

Von Hippel was a pioneer in the study of dielectrics, ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials, and semiconductors and was a codeveloper of radar during World War II.\n\nVon Hippel was born in Rostock, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, on November 19, 1898. He graduated in physics from the University of Göttingen, where he was taught by many eminent figures of mathematics and physics of the time, including David Hilbert, Richard Courant, Peter Debye, Robert Pohl, Max Born, Gustav Hertz, and Nobel Prize winner James Franck (who was his thesis supervisor). Von Hippel received his Ph.D. in physics in 1924, and in 1930 married Franck's daughter, Dagmar.\n\nIn 1933, with the ascension of Nazis to power in Germany, von Hippel decided to move to another country, mainly because his wife was Jewish, but due also to his political stance against the new regime. In 1934 he was able to secure a position with the University at Istanbul, Turkey, then spent a year in Denmark, working at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen. In 1936, accepting an invitation by Karl Compton, von Hippel moved again, this time to the U.S., and became an assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During this time, he studied the properties and behavior of high voltage gas discharges, using positive and negative Lichtenberg figures recorded on photographic film. In 1940 he founded the Laboratory for Insulation Research, which soon became one of the most important research and education centers in this area in the world.\n\nTogether with MIT's Radiation Lab, von Hippel and his collaborators helped to develop radar technology during the war. He was awarded the President's Certificate of Merit in 1948 by U.S. President Harry Truman. He became famous also for his discovery of ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of barium titanate (BaTiO).\n\nDuring the war the results on dielectrics obtained by the Laboratory for Insulation Research were classified information. After the war these results were prepared for publication. In 1954 von Hippel published \"Dielectrics and Waves\" and assembled \"Dielectric Materials and Applications\" with 22 collaborators. The Laboratory for Insulation Research also published several technical reports.\n\nArthur introduced his ideas of designing materials with properties prescribed for the purpose at hand, or molecular engineering, in 1956 in an article that discussed impurities and dislocations in materials, and the use of imperfections. He edited the volume \"Molecular Science and Molecular Engineering\" (1959).\n\nThe premier award of the Materials Research Society is named in his honor.\n\nHe died at 105 years of age, in 2003. His son, Frank N. von Hippel was a theoretical physicist and professor of Public Policy at Princeton University. Another son, Eric von Hippel, is a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management who has done pioneering research on user innovation. His uncle, Eugen von Hippel, described the ophthalmic hemangiomata that are part of von Hippel-Lindau disease, which bears his name.\n\nvon Hippel is briefly mentioned in Ayşe Kulin's historical novel \"Without a Country\" as one of the German scientists who took an academic position in Turkey while fleeing Nazi Germany.\n\n"}

The 59-lap race was the seventh round of the 2005 Formula One season, the 49th running of the European Grand Prix, and the 15th European Grand Prix as a standalone event (i.e. not an honorific title awarded to an existing event). It was the second of a series of six races held within eight weeks.\n\nThe race was won by championship leader Fernando Alonso for the Renault team, but is most famous for McLaren driver Kimi Räikkönen almost winning the race but crashing at the start of the final lap from the lead because of a suspension failure caused by a flat-spotted front tyre. Winner Alonso started in sixth position whilst Nick Heidfeld took the first and only pole position of his career for the Williams team. He eventually finished second in front of the Ferrari of Rubens Barrichello, who completed the podium in third position.\n\nThe race saw the return of the BAR-Honda team, who had been suspended for two races following the San Marino Grand Prix, due to a fuel tank irregularity. However, due to the 2005 engine regulations, they had to use engines from the San Marino race, which had been untouched for five weeks. Red Bull Racing decided that Vitantonio Liuzzi would retain his race seat for one round, before Christian Klien would take over for the Canadian Grand Prix and onwards.\n\nThe race marked yet another change in the qualifying system, with the aggregate system being discarded for a single session on Saturday, with cars in full race set-up (including fuel), and running in reverse order to the classification from the previous Grand Prix. This disadvantaged the BAR team significantly, as they were required to be the first two cars on the track. German Williams driver Nick Heidfeld took his only career pole position in front of his home fans, ahead of McLaren's Kimi Räikkönen and Heidfeld's teammate Mark Webber.\n\nWith an ambient temperature of and a track temperature of , the cars lined up for the start of the race. However, as the lights turned on to signal the start, Renault's Giancarlo Fisichella signalled that his car had stalled, and the start had to be aborted. As the field set off for another formation lap, Fisichella's car was pushed into the pitlane, and the race distance was reduced by 1 lap to 59. At the start, both Williams' got away from the line slowly, with Heidfeld beaten into the first corner by Räikkönen, and Webber overtaken by both Jarno Trulli and Juan Pablo Montoya before the first turn. Desperate to keep Trulli behind, Webber braked very late for the corner, and locked his front-right brake. Montoya turned in towards the apex of the corner, but made contact with Webber, who was forced to retire with suspension damage. Montoya's car was undamaged, but he lost several places as a result of being forced off line, and finished the first lap in 13th place. Several other cars were forced to take evasive action, with both Ferraris losing a large amount of time, and Ralf Schumacher breaking his front wing as he ran into the back of another car. During the first lap, Takuma Sato also damaged his front wing, and along with Schumacher, was forced to pit at the end of the lap, leaving both cars at the back of the field. Red Bull Racing's David Coulthard managed to avoid the confusion, and was in 4th place at the end of the first lap after starting 12th. Both Jordan drivers made good starts also, sitting in 10th and 11th. Räikkönen pushed away to a 1.9 second lead by the end of lap 1.\nAs the Jordans and Minardis were forced back down the field by faster cars, Toyota's Jarno Trulli was handed a drive-through penalty because his mechanics were still on the grid within 15 seconds of the race start. He dropped down from 3rd to 9th upon taking the penalty. On lap 6, Rubens Barrichello had an excellent battle with Jenson Button, taking 8th position after attempting to pass through 3 corners. Button lost a small amount of time as a result of the pass, which was enough for Montoya to close up behind and subsequently take 9th place. Barrichello, on a charge, overtook Vitantonio Liuzzi for 7th place on lap 8, but showed he was on light fuel, being the first driver to take their scheduled stop, which dropped him down to 12th position. On the very next lap, Heidfeld took his first stop, showing that his pole position was helped by having less fuel than several of the front-runners. The rest of the field began their pit stop sequences around lap 18, allowing Montoya to leapfrog Liuzzi for 8th place, while Barrichello put in some quick laps to move into an outright 4th position. David Coulthard, who led the race for 1 lap as the pit stop sequence unfolded, was given a drive-through penalty for exceeding the pitlane speed limit. With all the stops complete, Räikkönen retained a 2-second lead over Heidfeld, followed by Alonso, Barrichello, Coulthard, Felipe Massa, Michael Schumacher and Montoya.\n\nOn lap 30, Räikkönen appeared to lose concentration, going wide through the Ford chicane, allowing Heidfeld into the lead for one lap before the German had to pit. As he ran off road, Räikkönen damaged his bargeboard. The mistake allowed Alonso to gain 4 seconds. Heidfeld rejoined in 3rd after his second pit stop, and Barrichello, also on a 3-stop strategy, retained 4th. A few laps later whilst lapping Jacques Villeneuve, who ignored blue flags, Räikkönen locked his front-right tyre and ran wide, causing a \"flat spot\" and losing a small amount of time to Alonso. Due to the 2005 regulations, Räikkönen was unable to change the tyre and continue in the race, causing severe problems later in the race. Ralf Schumacher became only the second retirement of the race, losing his car at the Ford chicane, and spinning into the gravel trap. On lap 36, Räikkönen held a 15.2 second lead back to Alonso, who had an 8-second gap back to Heidfeld, followed by Barrichello, Coulthard, Massa, Michael Schumacher and Montoya.\n\nRäikkönen was able to continue posting competitive lap times and retain his lead over Alonso, but had to take his second pit stop on lap 43, handing Alonso the lead and a chance to decrease the gap. Alonso set the fastest lap of the race on lap 44, but then lost around 7 seconds after running off the road at the Dunlop hairpin. All of the front-runners pitted and held their positions, while Fisichella was able to move ahead of Montoya after some good laps. Meanwhile, Massa, in 6th position, ran off the road and lost a large amount of time, also damaging his tyres. With 8 laps remaining, Räikkönen held a 7.4 second lead over Alonso, and had victory in sight, but the tyre damage was causing major vibrations throughout the car and suspension, causing him trouble under braking and through corners. Alonso, with a clearly faster car at that stage, was able to close the gap quickly, and with 2 laps left, he had reduced it to just 2.7 seconds. Räikkönen's tyre began showing signs of imminent failure, and the vibrations in the car became increasingly severe. The McLaren team decided not to change the tyre, instead opting to go for the victory.\n\nAs Räikkönen started the final lap of the race, he was 1.5 seconds ahead of Alonso, and there was a chance for Alonso to perhaps catch the Finnish driver. However, under braking for turn 1, Räikkönen's suspension broke under the increasing pressure, sending him spinning narrowly past Jenson Button and into the gravel trap, ending his race. Alonso was able to take the last lap easily, winning the race ahead of Heidfeld and Barrichello. It was Alonso's fourth win for the season, increasing his championship lead to 32 points ahead of Räikkönen and Trulli. The failure on the final lap had denied Räikkönen his third successive victory. Heidfeld's third podium for the year meant he moved into fourth place in the championship standings. David Coulthard picked up a valuable fourth place for Red Bull, followed by Michael Schumacher, Fisichella, Montoya and Trulli. Felipe Massa finished 14th after his front wing failed with four laps remaining, damaging his left-front tyre, forcing him to pit to change both. Trulli and Coulthard were not the only ones to receive penalties, as Tiago Monteiro and Christijan Albers were issued drive-through penalties for ignoring blue flags.\n\n"}

The distinction is made more frequently by modern practitioners than is present in historical sources, but in a select few examples the terms for sportive grappling or \"geselliges ringen\" and earnest unarmed combat or \"kampfringen\" (where \"kampf\" is the Early Modern German term for \"war\" or \"battle\") were used to describe specific techniques which were only suitable for one scenario or the other.\n\nThere are no known sources describing medieval rulesets for Ringen competition. However, many living folk wrestling styles in Europe are fought until a throw is completed. The lack of detailed ground wrestling in the medieval wrestling treatises supports the theory that in both competition and combat the throw was more important than extended ground wrestling.\n\nWhile sportive grappling had fixed rules that prohibited dangerous techniques, usually starting in grappling hold and ending with a throw or submission, \"kampfringen\" can be considered a system of unarmed self-defense including punches, joint-locks, elbow strikes, chokeholds, headbutts and (to a limited extent) kicks.\n\nThe German tradition of \"ringen\" was eclipsed during the 17th century as the modern Baroque understanding of nobility precluded the participation of the higher classes in wrestling matches. Wrestling continued to be practiced among the lower classes, giving rise to the various traditional styles of folk wrestling.\n\nOne of the primary men to have shaped Ringen at the dawning of the Renaissance appears to have been Austrian master Ott Jud.\nOtt was a master of the early 15th century. He is credited in multiple medieval combat treatises with a series of wrestling techniques, including joint breaks, arm locks and throws. No treatise from Ott's own hand has survived, but his system is taught by several fencing masters of the later 15th century, including Hans Talhoffer (1443), Peter von Danzig and Jud Lew.\nPaulus Kal counts him among the \"society of Liechtenauer\", saying that he was wrestling teacher to the \"lords of Austria\" (possibly under Frederick III).\nAccording to both Talhoffer and Lew, Ott was a baptized Jew.\n\nOther treatises that contain material both on \"ringen\" and on swordsmanship include those of Fiore dei Liberi (c. 1410), Fabian von Auerswald (1462), Pietro Monte (c. 1480), and Hans Wurm (c. 1500).\n\nWrestling fell out of fashion among the upper classes with the beginning Baroque period. A late treatise on \"ringen\" is that by Johann Georg Passchen, published in 1659. Maybe the last book which deals with Ringen as a deadly martial art, is possibly \"Leib-beschirmende und Feinden Trotz-bietende Fecht-Kunst\" from Johann Andreas Schmidt, which was published in Weigel, Nürnberg in 1713.\n\nMany manuals combine fencing and wrestling into a specialized branch of kampfringen called \"ringen am schwert\" (\"grappling at the sword\"), designed to be used during armed combat.\nThis included closing techniques, disarms, weapon-seizures, pommel-strikes, and weapon-aided joint-locks.\n\nGrappling techniques are particularly central to the discipline of armoured fighting (\"Harnischfechten\").\n\nSeveral manuscripts detail grappling techniques for mounted combat or \"rossfechten\".\n\n\n"}

Gaudio also became the first Argentine man since Guillermo Vilas to win a grand slam, in 1979. Fellow Argentine Guillermo Coria, widely regarded as the favourite and best clay court player in the world coming into the tournament, was seeded 3rd for the event, whereas Gaudio was unseeded (ranked 44th) and with only two titles to his name, both of which he had won over two years before. After winning the first two sets convincingly, Coria began suffering from leg cramps. Gaudio won the next two sets; however, Coria came back and was up two breaks of serve in the final set. Coria had two match points at 6–5 before Gaudio prevailed 0–6, 3–6, 6–4, 6–1, 8–6. Gaudio also became the first man to win a Grand Slam tournament final after being bagelled in the first set. The tournament was noted for the excellent performance of the Argentine players – in addition to the two finalists, there were a semifinalist (David Nalbandian) and a quarterfinalist (Juan Ignacio Chela). It was also highlighted by a first round match between Fabrice Santoro and Arnaud Clément, lasting 6 hours and 33 minutes and ending in Clement's defeat 6–4, 6–3, 6–7, 3–6, 16–14, setting a new record for the longest singles match in the open era, which would stand until Wimbledon 2010.

He is the first Jewish mayor in the city's history, to date and the most recent white Mayor of Atlanta.\n\nSamuel A. Massell Jr. was born to Samuel A. Massell (1892-1961) and the former Florence Rubin (1901-1977) in 1927. He was known as \"Buddy\" during his childhood and high school years. He graduated from Druid Hills High School at age 16 and enrolled at the University of Georgia in Athens, where he was a member of the Phi Kappa Literary Society. He later transferred to Emory University before being drafted into the United States Army Air Force in 1946. Later, he returned to the University of Georgia and took night classes and earned his Bachelor's degree in commercial science from Atlanta Division of the University of Georgia in 1951. He married the former Doris Middlebrooks (1925-2015) of Hogansville, Georgia, in 1952.\n\nA lifelong Atlanta resident, Massell has had successful careers in real estate brokerage, elected office, tourism, and association management.\n\nFor twenty years, Massell was a realtor, having become vice president of the Allan-Grayson Realty Company, then one of the largest commercial brokerage firms in Atlanta. During that time, he was elected a charter member of the \"Million Dollar Club\" of the Atlanta Real Estate Board.\nHe was further honored on three occasions by the Georgia Association of Real Estate Boards for the \"Outstanding Transaction of the Year.\"\n\nWhile in real estate, Massell also became active in a wide range of civic work, which eventually led to the political arena. He served twenty-two years in elected offices, first as a city councilman in the town of Mountain Park, where he owned a lakehouse. He then went to serving on the Atlanta City Executive Committee and then ran to serve eight years as President of Atlanta's Board of Aldermen (now the City Council). He ran for Mayor of Atlanta in 1969 and won the race in a runoff. Mayor Massell was also the president of the 15,000-member National League of Cities.

{"id": "1959300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1959300", "title": "Nantahala River", "text": "Nantahala River\n\nThe Nantahala River () is a river in western North Carolina in the United States, within the Nantahala National Forest, and near the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Two-lane U.S. Highway 19/74, once part of the Trail of Tears, runs along the river, picnic areas dotting the route.\n\nThe River rises near the border of Georgia and North Carolina, close to the Southern Nantahala Wilderness and the Appalachian Trail. It empties into the Little Tennessee River at Fontana Lake.\n\nThe word \"Nantahala\" is Cherokee and means \"Land of the Noonday Sun\". The river runs through a narrow and steep gorge where in some areas the sun reaches the ground only when it is directly overhead during the middle of the day.\n\nThis river is popular with whitewater rafters, canoeists, and kayakers. Commercial rafting began in 1972 when the Nantahala Outdoor Center opened, leading to thousands of paddlers annually running the river. Today there are ten different outfitters operating on the Nantahala river. Each outfitter has a permit issued by the Forest Service which allows them to commercially raft the river. The Nantahala is one of the most popular rivers in the southeastern United States for paddlers of all skill levels.\n\nThe Nantahala is also a popular destination for fly fishing. Trout Unlimited has named the river one of the 100 Best Trout Streams in America, and it is widely regarded as one of the premier destinations for trout fishing in the Eastern United States. The river is frequently used for competitions, clinics, and practices held by the US Men's and US Youth National Fly Fishing teams. Most recently, the Nantahala played host to the 2015 US Youth National Fly Fishing Championship and the 2015 Men's Southeast Regional, with sessions held on the Upper and Lower sections, as well as the Raven's Fork on the nearby Cherokee Indian Reservation.\n\nThe part that can be rafted is long and has Class II and III rapids. It extends from the Nantahala Powerhouse to the town of Wesser. Twelve commercial outfitters are permitted by the USDA Forest Service to run guided trips. Two launch sites provide access. The main access is just downstream of the Nantahala Powerhouse and upstream of \"Patton's Run\". The other is at the Ferebee Memorial Picnic Area near where US 74 crosses the river. There are two take-out points, one above and one below \"Upper Nantahala Falls.\" Notable rapids include \"Patton's Run,\" \"Quarry,\" \"Whirlpool,\" \"Surfers,\" \"Bulls Run,\" and \"Upper Nantahala Falls.\" Just beyond the main take-out point in Wesser lies Lower Nantahala Falls, or Wesser Falls, which drops off at about a 45 degree angle with many sharp rocks. Immediately after this point the Nantahala flows into Fontana Lake.\n\nThe flow rate of this section of the Nantahala is dependent on releases from Nantahala Lake, which is controlled by Duke Energy. The Nantahala dam is a diversion dam; the water that normally flows through the river is diverted through a penstock before flowing through the Nantahala Powerhouse and back into the original river channel far downstream. The river is \"on\" when Duke Energy is generating electricity and releasing water. From late spring to early fall Duke Energy follows a regular release schedule to help support commercial rafting.\n\nThe opening of the main penstock is near the bottom of the Nantahala dam, and is underground for most of its length. Because of this the discharged water is always at or near the average groundwater temperature, which in this region is in the mid 50s (F).\n\nThis section of river is popular as a fly fishing destination. Although it is regularly stocked under North Carolina's Hatchery Supported regulations, it is home to one of North Carolina's healthiest populations of wild, stream-born Rainbow Trout. The river also has a self sustaining population of Brown Trout, many of which grow large. The current North Carolina state record Brown Trout, weighing , was caught from the Lower Nantahala in 1998, and specimens of or greater are fairly common.\n\nThe upper section of the river extends from the Nantahala Dam to the Nantahala Powerhouse. The uppermost section just below Whiteoak Falls is known as the Nantahala Cascades and is an extremely steep and challenging whitewater route. Upon reaching the bridge, the river becomes the Upper Nantahala and flattens out to become a solid Class III-IV run. The regular Nantahala River flow is diverted through a penstock so the only water normally flowing through this section comes from tributaries like Dick's Creek. However, during periods of very wet weather, or the rare long-term outage at the powerhouse, the river flows full. This section of the channel is narrow and features several Class III+ to V rapids including \"The Horns of God\", \"Big Kahuna\", and \"Chinese Feet.\"\n\nIn the Winter months, the Upper Nantahala is maintained as a delayed-harvest trout fishery from the mouth of Whiteoak Creek downstream to the Nantahala Powerhouse. The state of North Carolina stocks approximately 10,000 Brown, Rainbow, and Brook Trout annually in the upper river on top of an already existing population of stream-born Rainbow and Brown Trout.\n\n"}

This station can also be seen on Vidéotron channel 4 and in high definition on digital channel 604.\n\nUntil 2011, the station's transmitter facilities previously also hosted the transmitter for CBVE-TV (channel 5), the now-defunct local rebroadcaster of CBMT-DT/Montreal, when that station relocated to CBVT-DT's former analog channel (VHF channel 11), which broadcasts from Mount Bélair.\n\nCFCM was Quebec's first private television station, going on the air for the first time on July 17, 1954. CFCM started out as a private bilingual CBC/Radio-Canada affiliate. The station's original owner was Télévision de Québec, a consortium of theatre chain Famous Players and Quebec City's two private AM radio stations, CHRC and CKCV.\n\nAt its launch, CFCM immediately linked up with both the CBC and Radio-Canada microwave networks. The station started broadcasting an all-French service on March 17, 1957, when Télévision de Québec launched CKMI-TV. When Radio-Canada opened CBVT on September 7, 1964, CFCM joined the loose association of independent stations formed by Montreal's CFTM-TV and Chicoutimi's CJPM-TV a year earlier. This was the forerunner of TVA, which was formally organized on September 12, 1971.\n\nTélévision de Québec was nearly forced to sell its stations in 1969 because of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission's new rules requiring television stations to be 80 percent Canadian-owned. The largest shareholder, Famous Players, was a subsidiary of American film studio Paramount Pictures (Paramount and parent company Viacom eventually sold Famous Players to rival Cineplex Entertainment in 2005). Eventually, Famous Players reduced its shares to 20% by 1971, allowing Télévision de Québec to keep CKMI and CFCM The company renamed itself Télé-Capitale in 1974.\n\nFor a time in the 1980s, the station's logo was a \"4\" resembling the logo of independent Spanish language station WAPA-TV in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\nCFCM, along with five other stations, CKMI-TV, CHLT-TV, CHEM-TV and CFER-TV, were all purchased by Pathonic Communications in 1979. CFCM became the flagship station of Pathonic's new TVA-affiliated system.\n\nPathonic merged with Télé-Metropole, owner of CFTM, in 1990. Since then, CFCM has been a semi-satellite of CFTM, except for newscasts.\n\nCurrently, CFCM produces its own edition of the 6 p.m. bulletin, \"TVA Nouvelles\", anchored by Pierre Jobin. It is the only TVA station to entirely produce its own evening newscast.\n\nIn August 2011, CFCM-DT signed on the air.\n\nWith the use of PSIP, digital television receivers will list CFCM-DT's virtual channel as 4.1.\n\n"}

For example, files are accessed by a unique file name, but the actual data is stored in physical sectors scattered around a disk in either the local computer or in a network. In a location transparency system, the actual location where the file is stored doesn't matter to the user. A distributed system will need to employ a networked scheme for naming resources.\n\nThe main benefit of location transparency is that it no longer matters where the resource is located. Depending on how the network is set, the user may be able to obtain files that reside on another computer connected to the particular network. This means that the location of a resource doesn't matter to either the software developers or the end-users. This creates the illusion that the entire system is located in a single computer, which greatly simplifies software development.\n\nAn additional benefit is the flexibility it provides. Systems resources can be moved to a different computer at any time without disrupting any software systems running on them. By simply updating the location that goes with the named resource, every program using that resource will be able to find it. Location transparency effectively makes the location easy to use for users, since the data can be accessed by almost everyone who can connect to the Internet, who knows the right file names for usage, and who has proper security credentials to access it.\n\n"}

This station can also be seen on Vidéotron channel 4 and in high definition on digital channel 604.\n\nThe station went on the air for the first time on August 12, 1956. It was owned by \"La Tribune\", the city's major newspaper, along with CHLT radio. Like most television stations in Quebec, it was a dual affiliate of both CBC and Radio-Canada. It usually went on the air sooner than other Quebec stations, forcing it to fill the schedule with local shows. \"La Tribune\" was eventually acquired by Power Corporation of Canada, which sold CHLT to Telemedia in 1968.\n\nWhen CKSH-TV went on the air on September 19, 1974, it took all Radio-Canada programming away from CHLT. Sherbrooke's anglophone population was too small for CHLT to be viable as a privately owned CBC Television affiliate. As a result, it joined TVA that same day after CBMT in Montreal opened a translator in Sherbrooke. Five years later, Pathonic Communications acquired CHLT and four other stations from Telemedia. \n\nPathonic's stations often aired a schedule different from that offered on TVA flagship station CFTM-TV in Montreal. As a result, since CHLT's over-the-air signal reaches Montreal, it was carried on CF Cable and Vidéotron in that city. However, CFTM's owner, Télé-Metropole, bought full control of TVA in 1990. Since then, CHLT has been basically a semi-satellite of CFTM, except for newscasts and commercials.

Educated as an artist, Stillman subsequently converted to the profession of journalism, working primarily as a war correspondent in Crete and the Balkans, where he served as his own photographer. For a time, he also served as United States consul in Rome, and afterward in Crete during the Cretan insurrections. He helped to train the young Arthur Evans as a war correspondent in the Balkans, and remained a lifelong friend and confidant of Evans. Later in life, he seriously considered taking over the excavation at Knossos from Minos Kalokairinos, who had been stopped from further excavation by the Cretan Assembly; he was, however, prevented from pursuing that goal further by a failure to obtain a firman, or permission to excavate. Stillman wrote several books, one of which, his \"Autobiography of a Journalist\", suggests that he viewed himself primarily as a writer.\n\nStillman was born in Schenectady, New York in 1828. His parents were Seventh Day Baptists, and his early religious training influenced him throughout his life. He was sent to school in New York by his mother, who made great sacrifices so that he might get an education, and he graduated from Union College of Schenectady in 1848. Deciding at that time to pursue a career in art, he was one of the first students of the eminent Hudson River School painter Frederic Edwin Church, then fresh from his own studies with Thomas Cole and setting out on a career that would see him become the most famous (and financially successful) artist in America. Stillman had a contentious relationship with Church but picked up skills in the art of oil on canvas that would serve him well in the small but accomplished group of paintings by his hand that have survived, including, most famously, \"The Philosopher's Camp\" (Concord, MA Public Library). In 1850, Stillman traveled to England, where he made the acquaintance of John Ruskin, whose \"Modern Painters\" he had devoured; was introduced to Turner, for whose works he had unbounded admiration; and fell so profoundly under the influence of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais that on his return home in the same year he became known as the \"American Pre-Raphaelite.\" While Stillman had modest success as a painter and photographer, with far more productivity and innovation in the latter medium, his most lasting contribution to the arts in America was the founding of the periodical The Crayon directly under the influence of Ruskin. This publication had wide influence in his lifetime and since.\n\nIn 1852 Lajos Kossuth sent him on a fool's errand to Hungary to dig up crown jewels, which had been buried secretly during the insurrection of 1848–1849. While he was awaiting a projected rising in Milan, Stillman studied art under Yvon in Paris, and then, as the rising did not take place, he returned to the United States and devoted himself to landscape painting on Upper Saranac Lake in the Adirondacks and in New York City, where he started the \"Crayon\". It numbered Lowell, Aldrich and Charles Eliot Norton among its contributors, and when it failed for want of funds, Stillman removed to Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nThere he passed several years, but a fit of restlessness started him off once more to England. He renewed his friendship with Ruskin, and went with him to Switzerland to paint and draw in the Alps, where he worked so assiduously that his eyesight was affected. He then lived in Paris and was in Normandy in 1861 when the American Civil War broke out. He made more than one attempt to serve in the Northern ranks, but his health was too weak; in the same year he was appointed United States consul in Rome.\n\nIn 1865 a dispute with his government led to his resignation, but immediately afterwards he was appointed to Crete, where, as an avowed champion of the Christians in the island and of Cretan independence, he was regarded with hostility both by the Muslim population and by the Turkish authorities during the subsequent Cretan uprising. In September 1868 he resigned and went to Athens, where his first wife (a daughter of David Mack of Cambridge), worn out by the excitement of life in Crete, committed suicide.\n\nHe was an editor of \"Scribner's Magazine\" for a short time and then went to London, where he lived with Dante Gabriel Rossetti. In 1871 he married artist Marie Spartali, a daughter of the Greek consul-general Michael Spartali, although without his permission. When the insurrection of 1875 broke out in Herzegovina he went there as a correspondent of \"The Times\", and his letters from the Balkans aroused so much interest that the British government was induced to lend its countenance to Montenegrin aspirations.\n\nIn 1877–1883 he served as the correspondent of \"The Times\" at Athens; in 1886–1898 at Rome. During this time he was assisted in his photographic work by the nascent archaeologist and photographer, John Henry Haynes. He was a severe critic of Italian statesmen, and embroiled himself at various times with various politicians, from Crispi downwards.\n\nAfter his retirement he lived in Surrey, England where he died on July 6, 1901 at Frimley Green.\n\nHe wrote \"The Cretan Insurrection of 1866–1868\" (1874), \"\"The Amateur's Photographic Guide Book\"\" (1874) \"On the Track of Ulysses\" (1888), \"Billy and Hans\" (1897), \"\"The Old Rome and the New\"\" (1898), \"The Union of Italy, 1815–1895\" (1898), and \"Francesco Crispi\" (1899).\n\nRecent critics such as Andrew Szegedy-Maszak (in \"Antiquity and Photography\", Getty Museum, 2005) have argued that Stillman's photography, especially an album of views of the Athenian Acropolis, displayed an artistic sensibility and a genius of a higher order than the rest of his work. The first series was photographed in 1869 and privately published in 1870; Stillman rephotographed the Acropolis in 1882 and subsequently reordered the combined series in a second album. Stillman's photographs, in their daring perspectives, in their creative synthesis (inspired by Ruskinian ideas) of aesthetic feeling and a scientific/scholarly perspective on architectural form, and in their incorporation of the Greek landscape and the modern Greek context of ancient ruins, show a startlingly modern sensibility for their time, a way of seeing utterly different from the commercial photography of contemporary Greeks and foreigners, whose representations tended to cater to the set expectations of the foreign philhellenic and touristic market.\n\n\n"}

Macdonell\n\nArchibald Gordon Macdonell (3 November 1895 – 16 January 1941) was a Scottish writer, journalist and broadcaster, whose most famous work is the gently satirical novel \"England, Their England\" (1933).\n\nBorn in Poona, India, A. G. Macdonell's family were Scottish. His father was a physician, and he was educated at Winchester where he excelled academically and at sports, representing the school at association football and golf. During World War I, he served for two years as a lieutenant of the Royal Field Artillery before being invalided out of the army, possibly because of shell shock. (Lieutenant Cameron, the protagonist of \"England, Their England\" is sent home for that reason.) The war had a profound effect on him, as it did with so many of his generation. Afterwards he spent two years in eastern Europe, firstly on the reconstruction of Poland, and then on famine relief in Russia. In 1922 he joined the League of Nations where he spent five years. Politically, he was a supporter of the Liberal Party. During 1923 and 1924 he unsuccessfully contested Lincoln as the Liberal candidate.\n\nMacdonell made his living as a journalist in London, principally writing stage reviews for the \"London Mercury\". In 1933, he became famous with the publication of \"England, Their England\". The book gained considerable critical and popular acclaim, and won the James Tait Black Award that year.\n\nToday, Macdonell is remembered mostly for this one book. It is regarded as one of the classics of English humour and is much loved by readers for its evocation of England between the wars. It is particularly cherished by devotees of cricket for its famous description of the village cricket match. \n\nAlthough the rest of his books have been largely forgotten, several of them earned accolades during his lifetime. Among these are the novels \"How Like An Angel\" (1934) and \"The Autobiography of a Cad\" (1938). (The latter was reissued in the UK in 2001 in Prion Humour Classics.) Macdonell also wrote six mystery novels under the name 'Neil Gordon', one of them in collaboration with Milward Kennedy. He also wrote under the pseudonym 'John Cameron'.\n\nMacdonell was also a connoisseur of military history, and wrote a historical study called \"Napoleon and his Marshals\" (1934).\n\nMacdonell wrote a number of plays for the theatre. These were mostly comedies, with titles like \"What Next, Baby? Or Shall I Go To Tanganyika\", and were performed on the London stage. He also engaged in amateur theatrics himself, at least in the early part of his career. A review of an amateur production in Thursley, printed in \"The Times\" in January 1930, notes that he played his role with \"immense gusto\" which was \"vastly to the taste of the audience\". Macdonell also wrote \"The crew of the Anaconda\" in 1940, a \"Boys Own\" ripping yarn type tale.\n\nMacdonell was a regular contributor to \"The Observer\", and also a well-known broadcaster for the BBC Empire Service. He was a keen sportsman and a first-rate golfer, representing the Old Wykehamists on a number of occasions. \n\nHe died suddenly in Oxford in 1941 at the age of 45. In his obituary, \"The Times\" called him \"one of the leaders of the younger school of satirical novelists\". He is buried at Wolvercote Cemetery in Oxford.\n\nMacdonell was married twice. His first marriage lasted from 1926 to 1937, and gave him his only child Jenny. In July 1937, his wife Mona sued for divorce. According to the suit, Macdonell had committed adultery in a hotel in London the previous January. His second wife was a Viennese woman whose family was associated with the banking firm of Warburg-Schiff and who had fled to England just before the Anschluss.\n\nAs Neil Gordon\n\n"}

The wind would then blow away the lighter chaff allowing the edible grains to fall to the threshing floor, a large flat surface. The unneeded chaff would then be burned. As with the axe already placed against the tree in the preceding verse, the winnowing fork is already in hand, emphasizing the nearness of judgement.\n\nWinnowing forks, generally made of wood, were common at the time, and several dating from this period have been found. Modern scholars mostly agree that the term \"winnowing fork\" is the most accurate but older versions have fan, shovel, broom, and other translations. In the Eastern Orthodox church the word was most often interpreted as \"broom\" and a common icon shows Christ holding a broom.\n\nIn this verse John the Baptist is still assumed to be addressing the Pharisees and Sadducees. The eschatological imagery is quite clear. The wheat represents those who are truly repentant, the chaff those like the Pharisees and Sadducees who are not. The messiah will clear the world, and those that are worthy would be brought into his \"barn\" while those that were unworthy will burn in unquenchable fire. France notes that unquenchable is in no way a synonym for eternal and that no doctrine of eternal damnation for the wicked should be read into this passage.\n\nSome early manuscripts containing the text of this verse are:\n\n"}

G. Macdonell. It is particularly famed for its portrayal of village cricket.\n\nOne of a genre at the time, the novel examines the changing nature of English society during the interwar period. The style and subject matter recall the works of Evelyn Waugh and P. G. Wodehouse, Macdonell's contemporaries, as well as earlier writers such as Jerome K. Jerome. It is also known for its description of traditional village cricket. The novel is purported to be a roman à clef. The novel won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction in 1933. The title alludes to the refrain \"England, My England\" of the poem \"Pro Rege Nostro\" by William Ernest Henley.\n\nSet in 1920s England, the book takes the form of a travel memoir by a young Scotsman who has been invalided away from the Western Front, \"Donald Cameron\", whose father's will forces him to reside in England. There he writes for a series of London newspapers, before being commissioned by a Welshman to write a book about the English from the view of a foreigner. Taking to the country and provincial cities, Donald spends his time doing research for a book on the English by consorting with journalists and minor poets, attending a country house weekend, serving as private secretary to a Member of Parliament, attending the League of Nations, and playing village cricket. The village cricket match is the most celebrated episode in the novel, and a reason cited for its enduring appeal. An important character is Mr Hodge, a caricature of Sir John Squire (poet and editor of the \"London Mercury\"), while the cricket team described in the book’s most famous chapter is a representation of Sir John’s Cricket Club – the Invalids – which survives today. The book ends in the ancient city of Winchester, where Macdonell went to school.\n\n"}

It broadcasts an analogue signal on VHF channel 5 from a transmitter near Rue de la Montagne in Carleton-sur-Mer.\n\nOwned by Télé Inter-Rives, its studios are located on Boulevard Perron/Route 132 in Carleton-sur-Mer. This station can also be seen on Rogers Cable channel 4 and digital channel 610.\n\nThe original owner of CHAU was Dr. Charles Houde of La Télévision de la Baie des Chaleurs, who put the station on the air for the first time on October 17, 1959. Initially, like all other Quebec private TV stations, CHAU was a dual CBC/SRC affiliate airing both English and French shows. For CHAU, the ratio of English to French programs was 7:13. The station entered Radio-Canada's microwave network on March 24, 1960, and became an all-French station in 1968 when Montreal's CBMT opened a rebroadcaster in Carleton. In 1978, it became one of the last Canadian stations to air local programming in colour. \n\nIn 1979, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) gave CHAU a mandate to extend TVA service to northern New Brunswick and the Gaspé as part of an effort to improve French-language television service in those areas. Accordingly, around 1980, CHAU began carrying TVA programming in off-hours. It became an exclusive TVA affiliate on December 18, 1983, when Radio-Canada opened a rebroadcaster of CBGAT in the Carleton area.\n\nIn 2000, CHAU-TV was one of four television stations purchased from the Power Corporation of Canada by Corus Entertainment, and the only one located outside Ontario. It was soon resold.\n\nCHAU picks up the TVA signal from its sister station in Rivière-du-Loup, CIMT-DT, with both stations' logos used in network promos.\n\nCHAU-DT holds the distinction of owning the largest rebroadcaster network of any privately owned station in Quebec. Its rebroadcaster network blankets the Gaspé, and it also operates three rebroadcasters in New Brunswick. The station's main signal also covers most of northern New Brunswick—its city grade signal covers Campbellton, while its grade B signal reaches Bathurst. It also operates a bureau in Bathurst. CIMT also operates a rebroadcaster in Edmundston, and between them the two stations provide TVA service to the entire province.\n\nCHAU-DT was approved by the CRTC for and had plans for converting its transmitters to digital by the August 31, 2011, digital transition deadline, though none of its transmitters are subject to this deadline; neither the Gaspésie region nor the Campbellton area are designated as a mandatory market for digital television conversion. CHAU-DT converted all of its transmitters to digital in November 2011.\n\nOn June 6, 2018, Télé Inter-Rives filed an application with the CRTC to add a transmitter in the Magdalen Islands, expanding its already-large coverage area. If approved, this transmitter would receive the call sign CHAU-DT-12, broadcasting on VHF channel 12 at 100 watts from a tower in Cap-aux-Meules. The station had also expressed its interest in offering news coverage for viewers on the islands and work with independent media producers for further local content that would air on CHAU-DT and its repeater network, including the proposed CHAU-DT-12. The new repeater will broadcast on a channel previously used by local Radio-Canada repeater CBIMT - it and CBMT repeater CBMYT channel 7 closed down July 31, 2012, when budget cuts forced the closure of the CBC and Radio-Canada's remaining analogue transmitters. The closedown of the CBC / Radio-Canada repeater network had left the Magdalen Islands without any aerial television service, due to its location far from the mainland.\n\nCHAU-DT-5 was approved by the CRTC on April 8, 2013 to relocate its broadcasting frequency from channel 13 to channel 11; the station's owners cited interference from CBC Television station CBCT-DT in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, which also broadcasts on channel 13, as the reason.\n\n"}
{"id": "1959409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1959409", "title": "Antonio Stoppani", "text": "Antonio Stoppani\n\nAntonio Stoppani (24 August 18241 January 1891) was an Italian Catholic priest, patriot, geologist and palaeontologist. He studied the geology of the Italian region and wrote a popular treatise, \"Il Bel Paese\" (Italian for \"the beautiful country\"), on geology and natural history. He was among the first to propose a geological epoch dominated by human activities that altered the shape of the land.\n\nBorn in Lecco, Stoppani studied theology and became a priest in the order of the Rosminians. He was ordained in 1848, a year of turmoil with the Siege of Milan. During this siege, the Five Days of Milan, he became a hero for his role in the use of hot air balloons to send messages out of the besieged city. Along with Vincenzo Guglielmini, he ensured that the balloons could move over the walls of the city from the Seminario Maggiore di Porta Orientale and carry messages to rally the Italians against the Austrian Empire. He later became professor of geology in the Royal Technical Institute of Milan, and was distinguished for his research on the Triassic and Liassic formations of northern Italy.\n\nStoppani was important as a popularizer of science. His most popular work, \"Il Bel Paese, conversazioni sulle bellezze naturali la geologia e la geologia e la geografia fisica d'Italia\" (1876) (\"The Beautiful country, conversation on the natural beauty of geology and the physical geography of Italy\"), after which Bel Paese cheese was named by Egidio Galbani (the wrapper for the cheese included a portrait of Stoppani). It presents, by means of 32 didactic, scientific conversations supposedly in front of a fireplace, ideas and concepts from the natural sciences, in language accessible to the average 19th-century reader. It was so popular that it went into 120 editions by 1920 and was a textbook in schools. It deals especially with geological curiosities and the beauty of the Italian landscape. He commented on Italians who \"know almost nothing about the natural beauty of our country; yet take delight when someone calls it a garden\" and that the English fall in love with just one thing and devote their energies, emotions, and life to arrive dead or alive at the summit of mountains. His introduction to natural history declared that \"\"man should never disappear from nature, nor should nature disappear from man\"\". Stoppani, like many other clergyman naturalists of the period, was a supporter of the \"concordismo\", a school of thought that sought to find concordance between the teachings of the bible and evidence from geology. He promoted the idea that Catholics needed to learn science and that the bible was to be interpreted rather than taken literally. He was also an important figure in \"Catholic Alpinism\", a movement that sought to use mountains to tell God's glory. Stoppani was however a critic of the ideas of evolution that Darwin's publication had brought into Europe.\n\nStoppani's works on paleontology and geology include:\nIn this last work the author discussed the glaciation of the Italian Alps and the history of Italy during the Pleistocene age.\nStoppani described several species of fossil molluscs while other fossil species have been named in his honour, including \"Fedaiella stoppanii\" Marini 1896 (a snail), \"Placochelyanus stoppanii\" Oswald 1930, \"Lymnaea stoppanianus\" Coppi, 1876 and \"Gyraulus (Gyraulus) stoppanii\" (Sacco, 1886). Most of his collections are in the \"Museo di Storia Naturale, Milano\", the building of which he was responsible for constructing as director from 1882 to 1891. Stoppani Glacier in Tierra del Fuego is named after him.\n\nStoppani was the great-uncle of Maria Montessori, famous for her work on education; he was the uncle of Maria's mother Renilde. The Italian painter Giovanni Battista Todeschini (1857–1938) was his nephew. An oil painting of Stoppani made by Todeschini is held in the Public Museum at Lecco.\n\nIn 1873 Stoppani acknowledged the increasing power and impact of humanity on the Earth's systems and referred to the \"anthropozoic era\" an idea that was possibly based on George Perkins Marsh who lived in Italy and whose work, \"Man and Nature\", was translated into Italian in 1872. In a later edition of \"Man and Nature\" published as \"The Earth as Modified by Human Action\" in 1874, Marsh noted:\n\nThe idea of a new geological epoch, the anthropocene, was proposed in 2000 by Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer. While some have pointed to the ideas of Marsh, Stoppani, Teilhard de Chardin and Vladimir Vernadsky (\"noösphere\") as precursors, others have pointed out a distinction in the geological epoch proposed by Crutzen. Whereas the effects of man proposed in the past were small and gradual, the effects are sharply marked in Cruzen's anthropocene.\n\n"}

It is designed to facilitate transportation between small General Aviation airports using small aircraft as an alternative to traditional airline travel.\n\nThe terrorist attacks of September the 11th caused the Transportation Security Administration to dramatically increase security measures. These increases also increased the time passengers had to spend at the airport before making it onto a flight. After the tourism industry rebounded from the recession caused by the attacks, the increase in traffic further increased the strain on the system.\n\nNASA and the FAA saw in General Aviation the cure to the aviation industries problems. With more than 3,400 small airports in the U.S. alone, a large amount of traffic could be diverted from mass transit airline travel, to private, small aircraft General Aviation.\n\nWith new technologies proposed by NASA and new logistics, systems and infrastructure developed by the FAA, the idea was born.\n\nThe concept of the Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) was first envisioned in the late 1980s in a workshop by the AIAA, NASA, FAA, and industry titled, \"The Role of Technology in Revitalizing the U.S. General Aviation Industry.\" The SATS concept was first articulated by that name in the 1997 presentation by NASA at the Oshkosh Airventure Convention, \"Life After Airliners.\" The SATS concept emerged from the work of the Advanced General Aviation Transport Experiments (AGATE) Alliance. The AGATE Alliance was a public-private partnership (1994-2001), established by NASA, between government and industry to revitalize the technology deployment capacity for the U.S. General Aviation industry. Based on the technology design guidelines, system standards, and certification standards developed by AGATE, a new generation of personal transportation aircraft were developed by industry from around the world. These new aircraft appear to be economically and operationally viable for use in on-demand transportation fleet operations. The first of the fleet operators began services in 2005, with increasing numbers of companies starting operations in 2006 and 2007.\n\nA poor safety record for small aircraft operating from general aviation airports, restricted airspace capacity, and weather complications were seen as the greatest barriers to the expanded use of small aircraft and community airports for public transportation. The SATS Project (2001-2006), conducted by NASA and partners in the National Consortium for Aviation Mobility (NCAM) proved the viability of technical capabilities in the following four areas:\n\n\n\n"}

It has been active since 2001, with a number of notable artists performing. It was first held in 2001, but the name was used as early as 1995. Uppsala Reggae Festival attracts attendees of all ages from all over the world. In connection with the 2001 festival, Uppsala was given the epithet \"The Reggae Mecca of Scandinavia\" by the Swedish National TV4, on the grounds that the festival then was the only festival in Scandinavia specifically dedicated to reggae. The third Uppsala Reggae Festival was awarded that year's cultural award by Swedish National Radio Broadcasting, and the fourth festival featured the largest reggae lineup ever to play in Scandinavia. Starting in 2002, the festival was held in August each year in Uppsala, 70 km north of Stockholm until it relocated in 2012. In 2004, the festival settled down at its current venue, KAP, which is central and in the heart of the city. Both in 2004 and 2005, the festival had about 10,000 attendees. Moreover, in 2007, the festival had the most visitors recorded to date with approximately 24,000 patrons attending the festival.\n\nIn 2012, the festival moved to Gävle where it was held in 2012 and 2013.

Its owners soon realized that they didn't have the revenue to challenge Radio-Canada affiliate CKRS-TV (now CKTV-DT) on their own. To obtain better programming, CJPM started sharing programs with the largest privately owned francophone station in Canada, CFTM-TV in Montreal. Along with Quebec City's CFCM-TV (which joined the group in 1964 after disaffiliating from Radio-Canada), this collective of independent stations was the forerunner of TVA, though the network wasn't formally created until September 12, 1971 with CJPM as one of its three charter affiliates, the others being CFTM and CFCM.\n\nCJPM's original owners sold the station to Télé-Métropole, owner of CFTM, in 1982.

By producing country songs that employed many styles and sounds found in pop music, the country music industry sought to gain new listeners without alienating its traditional country audience. Country pop music blends genres like rock, pop, and country, continuing similar efforts that began in the late 1950s, known originally as Nashville sound and later on as Countrypolitan. By the mid-1970s, many country artists were transitioning to the pop-country sound, which led to some records' charting high on mainstream top 40 as well as the country \"Billboard\" charts.\n\nThe joining of country and pop began in the 1950s when studio executives Chet Atkins and Owen Bradley wanted to create a new kind of music for the young adult crowd after \"rockabilly stole away much of country music's youth audience\". According to Bill Ivey, this innovative genre originated in Nashville, Tennessee and thus became known as the Nashville Sound. He believes that the \"Nashville Sound often produced records that sounded more pop than country\", after the removal of the fiddle and banjo. Patsy Cline, Jim Reeves, and Eddy Arnold were among the most popular artists during this time. This was intended to have country singers gain more success in pop music and sell more records. The first male artists to come out of this new genre were Jim Reeves and Eddy Arnold. Both Reeves and Arnold had major influence on their RCA labelmate Elvis Presley, apparent not only in secular songs, but even more so in country gospel songs. The first female country singer to emerge from this new genre was Patsy Cline in the early 1960s. The example she created was followed by other female country artists, such as Lynn Anderson, Crystal Gayle, and Shania Twain, who gained prominence in later years. Even though Cline also gained widespread acceptance from country and pop audiences alike, the Nashville Sound was not well received by country purists, and faced competition, first from the Bakersfield Sound and later the outlaw movement on that front; on the pop side, the format was overshadowed by the British Invasion, which was taking place during the same time that Cline and Reeves, two of the biggest names associated with the Nashville sound, died in separate airplane crashes.\n\nThe Nashville sound eventually evolved into countrypolitan during the late 1960s and 1970s and had varying levels of success, with several artists recording in the style, many of whom were otherwise country purists or outlaws: Ray Price (\"For the Good Times\"), Charley Pride (\"Kiss an Angel Good Morning\"), Charlie Rich (three such hits), Jessi Colter (\"I'm Not Lisa\"), Crystal Gayle (\"Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue\"), Kris Kristofferson, and Lynn Anderson all charted pop-influenced country hits during the 1970s.\n\nCountry pop found its first widespread acceptance during the 1970s. It started when pop music singers, like Glen Campbell, John Denver, Olivia Newton-John, and Anne Murray, began having hits on the country charts. Songs like Campbell's \"Rhinestone Cowboy\" were among the biggest crossover hits in country music history. These pop-oriented singers thought that they could gain higher record sales and a larger audience if they crossed over into the country world. One of the artists who did this was Olivia Newton-John, who emerged from Australia in the mid-1970s, hoping to make it big in the United States. When her single \"Let Me Be There\" became a big pop-country crossover hit in 1974, it became quite controversial, especially after Newton-John won a Grammy award for \"Best Female Country Vocal Performance\" for the song, and also won the Country Music Association's most coveted award for females, \"Female Vocalist of the Year\" (beating out established Nashville artists Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynn, and Tanya Tucker, as well as Canadian transplant Anne Murray). Newton-John began moving away from country in the late 1970s after starring in \"Grease\" and focused mostly on pop music from then onward.\n\nA group of artists, troubled by this trend, formed the Association of Country Entertainers (ACE) in 1974. The debate raged into 1975, and reached its apex at that year's Country Music Association Awards when reigning Entertainer of the Year Charlie Rich (who himself had a series of crossover hits) presented the award to his successor, John Denver. As he read Denver's name, Rich set fire to the envelope with a cigarette lighter. The action was taken in some quarters as a protest against the increasing pop style in country music; Rich himself cited medication as reason for his behavior. The ACE would only last two years; its two biggest backers, firm traditionalists George Jones and Tammy Wynette, faced a bitter divorce, and Jean Shepard, the other major backer of the ACE, closed down the organization when she could not find others that shared her enthusiasm for the association's purpose.\n\nIn 1977, Kenny Rogers, former frontman of the rock band The First Edition, burst onto the country charts with \"Lucille\" and would go on to become the most successful of the country pop performers, topping charts all over the world and taking the genre to the zenith internationally, selling more than 130 million records. After \"Lucille\", Rogers had a string of songs that did well on both the country and pop charts around the world, including \"Daytime Friends\", \"The Gambler\", and \"Coward of the County\", all of which were produced by Larry Butler. Rogers would go on to push the boundaries of pop influence in country music, having records produced by the likes of The Bee Gees, Lionel Richie, David Foster, and George Martin, all of which did well in both the pop and country markets. In 1979 Barbara Mandrell had her highest crossover hit with her number 1 song \"(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right\" It charted number 31 on the \"Billboard\" Top 40. Several of her other hits charted well on the adult contemporary charts and the Bubbling under 100 charts. Mandrell also did countrypolitan style music on her \"Barbara Mandrell & the Mandrell Sisters\" show. She had R & B artists, pop artists, and country artists featured every week. It was the last successful musical variety show on TV. (Running from 1980 to 1982 – Mandrell had to quit the show because of health reasons.) She is also known for her \"Blue-Eyed Soul\" sound. She was given the nickname The Princess of Steel, for her ability at the steel guitar. She was one of country music's most successful crossover artists during the 1970s and 1980s. Like many of her contemporaries at the time, she sang crossover country material, that either was well-liked or highly criticized. Her biggest hits include \"Sleeping Single In a Double Bed\", \"(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right\", \"Years\", and \"Crackers\". Some traditional country artists accused Mandrell of being too glitzy, too \"Hollywood\" with her pop-influenced sound.\n\nDolly Parton, who had already achieved considerable success as a mainstream country artist, wanted to expand her audience and go in new directions, so she decided to make a change in 1977, crossing over into the pop music world with No. 1 country and No. 3 pop hit that year, \"Here You Come Again\". She followed it up with a number of additional crossover pop hits, including \"Two Doors Down\" and \"Heartbreaker\" (both 1978), \"Baby I'm Burning\" (1979), \"Starting Over Again\" (1980), and \"9 to 5\", which topped both the country and pop singles charts in early 1981. (Despite her being one of the most successful practitioners of country pop crossover during the late 1970s and 1980s, Parton, because of her upbringing and mountain roots, is regarded by most critics as one of country's most authentic performers.)\n\nCountry pop reached an early peak immediately following the movie \"Urban Cowboy\" in the early 1980s. \"Urban Cowboy\" was the third music-themed hit film to star John Travolta, each from a different genre; much like \"Saturday Night Fever\" did for disco and \"'Grease\" did for oldies, \"Urban Cowboy\" likewise popularized pop-country, helping to boost the career of Mickey Gilley in particular (whose real-life bar and music were featured in the film), along with other songs that appeared on the film's soundtrack.\n\nSome older artists from the 1960s and 1970s converted their sound to country pop or 'countrypolitan', such as Parton, Willie Nelson, and Dottie West. West, who had been around since the 1960s, completely changed her image into a more sexy and risky profile in the early 1980s, following a series of hit duets with Kenny Rogers. (Rogers also had a duet hit with Parton, the Bee Gees-penned \"Islands in the Stream\", which topped the country and pop singles charts in late 1983. The Bee Gees themselves have one credited country hit to their name, 1978's \"Rest Your Love on Me,\" which was made an even bigger hit by Conway Twitty in 1980.) After the success with Rogers, West wanted to remain on top, so in order to keep up with current country music, she continued to record more pop-sounding material. Because of this, West achieved her biggest success as a country singer during this time, acquiring her first No. 1 hit as a solo artist thanks to her music in 1980 titled \"A Lesson in Leaving\".\n\nAlabama, Eddie Rabbitt, Juice Newton, and Ronnie Milsap also began experiencing crossover success during the early 1980s. Four of Alabama's most successful songs of the early 1980s—\"Feels So Right\", \"Love in the First Degree\", Take Me Down\", and \"The Closer You Get\" (the last two of which were covers of songs by then-pop band Exile)—all reached the Top 40 of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, while four of Ronnie Milsap's No. 1 songs between 1980 and 1982 reached the Hot 100s Top 20, the most successful of which was the No. 5 hit \"(There's) No Gettin' Over Me\". Rabbitt had three top-5 pop songs in 1980–1981, and \"I Love a Rainy Night\" reached No. 1 on both the Hot 100 and \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles chart. Country star Juice Newton also achieved country-pop success with several crossover hits in the early '80s, including \"Queen of Hearts\", \"The Sweetest Thing (I've Ever Known)\", and Grammy-winner \"Break It To Me Gently,\" also penning \"Sweet Sweet Smile,\" the only country hit for easy-listening act The Carpenters. Former pop acts, such as Exile, Merrill Osmond (both solo and with his fellow Osmond Brothers; sister Marie Osmond also had a career renaissance in this period), Bill Medley (formerly of The Righteous Brothers), Tom Jones, Michael Johnson, Billy Joe Royal, B. J. Thomas, Nicolette Larson, Paul Davis and Dan Seals (\"England Dan\" of England Dan and John Ford Coley) began targeting their music at the country market in the early 1980s with a country-pop sound. Engelbert Humperdinck, who had recorded several Nashville country ballads in his earlier career but had never charted any of them on the country charts, recorded his first and only country top-40 hit when his easy listening hit \"After the Lovin'\" crossed over to reach the bottom of the country top 40.\n\nAlthough a number of country pop artists continued to have hits, most notably Alabama, Parton, Mandrell, Rabbitt, and Milsap, the mid-1980s saw a major sea change within the country music industry and the revival of traditional country sounds, as the boost in country's crossover popularity had collapsed; by 1984, country record sales had fallen to the point they were before \"Urban Cowboy\" was released. For most of the late 1980s through 1990, traditional-sounding country acts that were not as conducive to pop crossover dominated the country charts.\n\nCountry pop enjoyed a resurgence in the 1990s, primarily because of the beginning proliferation of country music to the FM radio dial, which in turn was aided by the increase of FCC licenses for suburban and rural FM stations in the late 1980s and an increase in talk radio on the AM dial, as well as a decision by \"Billboard\" to no longer count record sales toward the country singles chart, giving country radio full power to determine a chart ranking by their collective airplay. The commercial boom in the industry during this time was also attributable to the rise of talented artists who coincided with the implementation of new marketing strategies that were meant to attract a larger fan base; this further pushed the genre into a pop musical style with an emerging new image. Garth Brooks rose to fame during the 1990s with a string of several extremely successful albums and songs. Shania Twain would rival this success with her three albums \"The Woman in Me\", \"Come On Over\", and \"Up!\". In the last few years, country singer LeAnn Rimes has proved her ability to sing country pop songs such as the record-setting \"How Do I Live\", which spent 69 weeks on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, the second longest single in the record history. This achievement came in spite of the fact that a nearly identical version of the same song by Trisha Yearwood was released at the same time and was also a hit. Rimes also had a hit with the pop songs \"Can't Fight the Moonlight\" and \"I Need You\", the latter of which required a remix to be suitable for country radio.\n\nIncorporating elements of pop into country music became extremely popular by the late '90s, thus producing many crossover hits and artists, especially on the adult contemporary charts. Country love songs also became more popular with songs like \"To Make You Feel My Love\", \"Cowboy Take Me Away\", \"I Love You\", \"Breathe\", \"It's Your Love\", \"Just to See You Smile\", \"This Kiss\", \"The Way You Love Me\", \"You're Still the One\", \"From This Moment On\", \"You've Got a Way\", \"Valentine\", etc.\n\nIn the 1990s, many country artists experienced huge crossover success. In addition to Brooks, Twain, McBride and Rimes, Billy Ray Cyrus, Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Dixie Chicks, Jo Dee Messina, Martina McBride, Lonestar, Mary-Chapin Carpenter and Wynonna Judd all had songs cross over to Top 40 and/or Adult Contemporary radio, sometimes with remixes eliminating steel guitars and other \"country\" elements to be more suitable for pop radio. Brooks, Reba McEntire, and other artists also maintained high profiles on the album charts despite having less radio crossover success.\n\nThe early 2000s also saw continued success of these artists. Lee Ann Womack scored a big hit with \"I Hope You Dance\". The Dixie Chicks had continued success with a less mainstream country-pop sound when they released their bluegrass-influenced album \"Home\" in 2002. However, by the mid-2000s there were fewer country acts having crossover success. \n\nWith her exposure on TV's \"American Idol\", Carrie Underwood became a crossover success in 2006 and 2007 though, with her hit single \"Before He Cheats\", which was notable for becoming a success on mainstream pop radio \"without\" a more \"pop-friendly\" remix. Underwood has had additional, but more spotty, success on pop radio since. In 2009, British pop singer Lily Allen had a large international hit on the pop charts with the bluegrass inspired \"Not Fair\". Allen later returned to country music with the country pop song \"As Long As I Got You\" from her third studio album \"Sheezus\". Lady Antebellum and Rascal Flatts have also had crossover success in the late 2000s and early 2010s.\nTaylor Swift rose to fame in the late 2000s, buoyed by the success of her country pop singles \"Teardrops On My Guitar\" and \"Our Song\", with the latter making Swift the youngest person in history to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs chart. Her chart-topping second studio album \"Fearless\" was released in 2008; it spawned international hit singles \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong With Me\", becoming two of the best selling singles of all time. In 2009, Swift became the first country artist in history to win a MTV Video Music Award. Later in 2010, Swift won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and Best Country Album for \"Fearless\", becoming the youngest artist to win the top prize at that time. \"Fearless\" went on to become Diamond certified by Recording Industry Association of America for moving over 10 million units in the US. Her subsequent albums \"Speak Now\" (2010) and \"Red\" (2012) topped multiple charts globally, including the Top Country Albums and \"Billboard\" 200; both of those album sold 1 million copies in their debut week sales, opening 1.0 million for \"Speak Now\" and 1.2 million for \"Red\". On \"Red\", Swift incorporated elements of electronic and dance such as dubstep and worked with pop producers Max Martin and Shellback on several tracks, including the pop hits \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", \"I Knew You Were Trouble\", and \"22\", which were more favored by pop radio over country radio. Swift collaborated with rapper B.o.B on his country rap single \"Both of Us\", and dueted with Tim McGraw on his 2013 single \"Highway Don't Care\" featuring Keith Urban. Swift labeled herself as a pop artist since 2014's \"1989\". The subsequent \"Reputation\" (2017) and \"Lover\" (2019) were pop albums, though \"Lover\" drew on country influences in songs like \"Lover\" and \"Soon You'll Get Better\"; the latter being a collaboration with Dixie Chicks. Swift has also written songs for other country pop acts, such as Little Big Town's \"Better Man\" and Sugarland's \"Babe\". Achieving both national and international prominence through her tour gross, sales records and critical acclaim, Swift has been credited for bringing recognition of country music \"within the broad expanse of music worldwide\"; Country Music Association acknowledged that her talent and presence \"will have a long-term positive impact on the appreciation of country music for generations to come\".\n\nUncle Kracker also achieved success when his number 3 adult contemporary hit \"Smile\" also became a number 6 country hit. Jason Aldean and Kelly Clarkson hit number 3 on adult contemporary, 9 on adult pop and 1 on country charts with the song \"Don't You Wanna Stay\". Other recent records to hit on both the pop and country charts have included Miley Cyrus' \"The Climb\", Lady Antebellum's \"Just A Kiss\", The Band Perry's \"If I Die Young\", Kelly Clarkson's \"Mr. Know It All\", Hunter Hayes' \"Wanted\", and Florida Georgia Line's \"Cruise\". Sam Hunt has also earned significant crossover appeal. His 2014 debut album \"Montevallo\" reached No. 1 on Top Country Albums and number 3 on the \"Billboard\" 200. His 2017 single \"Body Like a Back Road\" reached No. 1 on Hot Country Songs, number 6 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and number 11 on Adult Top 40.\n\nIn 2018, many country artists achieved international pop hit singles in collaborations with mainstream pop artists. This included Chris Stapleton who collaborated with Justin Timberlake on Hot 100 top ten single \"Say Something\"; Urban-pop star Bebe Rexha whose duet with the country duo Florida Georgia Line \"Meant to Be\" reached No. 2 both in Australia and in the U.S.; and German DJ Zedd whose dance hit \"The Middle\" feature main vocals from Maren Morris.\n\nOf particular note, in 2012, \"Billboard\" restored recording sales to the chart formula but also added airplay from non-country stations, giving an inherent advantage to country pop crossover songs, at the same time maintaining the 1990 formula solely to measure country radio airplay. After the change, crossover songs have increasingly set the record for the longest run atop the country chart for longer and longer stretches; \"Meant to Be\" currently holds the record, 50 weeks and counting as of November 2018, more than double the pre-2012 record (Leroy Van Dyke's \"Walk On By\" was atop the chart for 19 weeks in 1963, during the 1958-1990 period of a unified sales, jukebox and airplay chart; three songs topped the various separate country charts for 21 weeks each between 1948 and 1955).\n\nDespite receiving little airplay for her singles sent to country radio, Kacey Musgraves won the Grammy award for Album of the Year in 2019, for her fourth studio album \"Golden Hour\". Musgraves’ success was unprecedented in the sense that she earned fans from both the pop and country genres without the benefit of airplay on country radio, instead promoting her music through online media platforms such as YouTube and Apple Music.\n\nIn October 2019, country duo Dan + Shay released a joint single with pop singer-songwriter Justin Bieber, \"10,000 Hours\", which went to number one on both the Billboard Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts.\n\n"}

Esperanto II was one of several languages investigated by the International Auxiliary Language Association, the linguistic research body that eventually standardized and presented Interlingua de IALA.\n\nSeveral of the grammatical inflections were changed. The accusative is in \"-u,\" which replaces the final vowel of nouns, pronouns, and correlatives \"(ju\" for \"ĝin, tu\" for \"tion),\" and for the plural \"-n\" is added to both nouns and pronouns \"(lin\" \"they\", \"lina\" \"their\"). Neither suffix affects adjectives, which do not agree with their noun. The correlative series \"tiu, ĉiu\" becomes \"ta, cha\" when modifying a noun. The indefinite suffix \"-aŭ\" is replaced with adverbial \"-e,\" and the inchoative \"-iĝ-\" becomes \"-ev-.\"\n\nMany small grammatical words are also replaced, such as \"ey\" for \"kaj\" \"and\", \"be\" for \"ĉe\" \"at\", and \"ki\" for \"ol\" \"than\". The work of the preposition \"de\" \"of, by, from\" is divided up into several more specific prepositions.\n\nAdditionally, the project introduced international cognates when such cognates were readily recognized; for example, \"skolo\" was used for \"school\" in place of standard Esperanto's \"lernejo\" (a derivation of \"lerni\", \"to learn\"); Esperanto has \"skolo\" only in the sense of \"a school of thought\", which is also the meaning that the word has in the example passage below. Antonymic roots such as \"tarde\" for \"malfrue\" \"late\" and \"poke\" for \"malmulte\" \"few\" are used today in Esperanto poetry, though they resemble Ido and Esperanto may have acquired them from that language.\n\nThe orthography and phonology were changed to eliminate diacritics and a few of the more marginal sounds: becomes , and conflate to , becomes , becomes , becomes , becomes , and become , becomes .\n\nChanges from standard Esperanto that involve more than orthography are highlighted in this sample passage and explained below.\n\n\n\n\nIn the order in which they occur in the passage above, these are:\n\n\"-u : -on\" (as \"Kongresu : Kongreson, fondu : fondon). be : ĉe. te : je\" (date). \"farevis : fariĝis. ey : kaj. kaes : kies, de kiu. ki : ol. anke : ankaŭ. ta : tiu. kay : kiu? pliente ki\" : more than. \"-n : -j\" (as \"yaron : jaroj, membrun : membrojn). kaw : kiun? projekto : projekto\" (change in pronunciation). \"di\" : (accepted) by. \"pos : post. cha : ĉiu. dey\" : from. \"tala : tia. li-n-a : ili-a (lin\" for \"ili\" is \"li\" plus plural \"-n). lo : ? ankore : ankoraŭ. ju : ĝin. tu : tion. tiente: ? niam : neniam.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1959449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1959449", "title": "Stephen Storace", "text": "Stephen Storace\n\nStephen John Seymour Storace (4 April 1762 – 19 March 1796) was an English composer. His sister was the famous opera singer Nancy Storace. He was born in London in the Parish of St Marylebone to an English mother and Italian father. Relatively little is known through direct records of his life, and most details are known second-hand through the memoirs of his contemporaries Michael Kelly, the actor John Bannister, and the oboist William Thomas Parke.\n\nHis father, Stefano Storace (b. Torre Annunziata, ca. 1725; d. London, ca. 1781), an Italian contrabassist and composer, taught him the violin so well that at ten years old he played successfully the most difficult music of the day. The composer's youth was spent entirely in the company of musicians, since his father (also a composer and arranger) was the Musical Director of Marylebone Gardens. Mistrusting the quality of musical education available in England, Stefano Storace sent his son to Italy to study, at the Conservatorio di Sant' Onofrio, Naples. Stephen neglected his musical studies in Italy, and went on painting expeditions with Thomas Jones. His interest in art may not have been entirely extinguished, however – unlike the works of any of his English contemporaries, the printed vocal scores of all his operas feature elaborate engravings of what are presumed to be the stage-designs, and it is suggested that these drawings were Stephen's own work. No other artist, at least, seems to have claimed credit for them. Towards the end of their studies, Stephen and Nancy first made the acquaintance of Michael Kelly, whom they encountered by chance in Livorno. Kelly was with English-speaking friends, and ventured an opinion (in English) as to whether the young person with Stephen was a boy or a girl. \"The person is a she-animal\" retorted an offended Nancy in English as the first remark in what would be a lifelong friendship with both the Storaces.\n\nStephen Storace returned to England sometime between the years of 1780 and 1782, most likely to settle his father's affairs after his death in Naples, which probably happened around 1780–1781. Nancy, accompanied by her mother, Elizabeth, went to Vienna in January 1783. Nancy entered into an arranged marriage (most likely arranged by her mother) to the English violinist and composer John Fisher in March 1784. The marriage only lasted a few months. It is unclear how Stephen obtained his first commission to compose an Italian opera for the Viennese stage, but the commission was most likely obtained by Nancy sometime in the fall of 1784, with Stephen arriving in Vienna sometime in late December of that same year.\n\nStephen produced his first opera, \"Gli sposi malcontenti\", at Vienna, on 1 June 1785. The premiere, however, was marred by the failure of his sister's voice. She was singing the \"prima buffa\" role and collapsed on-stage in mid-aria, causing the performance to be abandoned. Nancy was pregnant and gave birth to a baby girl a few weeks later. The child was given to a foundling home by Elizabeth Storace, who claimed that it belonged to Nancy's estranged husband, John Fisher, who had been banished by the Emperor some months earlier for beating Nancy. Elizabeth Storace claimed that they did not care if the child lived or died; the child died in the foundling home a month after she was born. Nancy's return to the stage four months later was marked by the performance of \"Per la ricuperata salute di Ofelia\", composed specially for the occasion by a trio of composers – Mozart, Salieri, and the unknown \"Cornetti\" (which may have been a pen-name for Stephen, Salieri, or even perhaps Emperor Joseph II). This rare example of a Mozart-Salieri collaboration was discovered only in 2016. \n\nThe Storaces knew Mozart in Vienna. Nancy sang Susanna at the premiere of Mozart's \"Le nozze di Figaro\", and Kelly sang Don Curzio. The \"English circle\" in Vienna also included the composer Thomas Attwood. \n\nStephen produced a second opera in Vienna, \"Gli equivoci\", founded on Shakespeare's \"The Comedy of Errors\".\n\nThere is no clear explanation why the Storaces abandoned Vienna at the height of their success there. The reasons are suggested to be more personal than professional. Certainly the Emperor spoke of her with great admiration, even using her abilities as an arbitrary unit of currency – \"I'd not give you a Storace for it!\". Quite possibly Nancy was under pressure from Elizabeth, who was not at all happy in Vienna, and wished to return to England with both of her children in tow. Nancy left Vienna in February 1787, along with her \"entourage\" of Michael Kelly, her brother, and Thomas Attwood. Buoyed-up by their success on the Viennese stage, the coach-party which left for London could not have imagined they would find themselves rejected and unwanted in London, where their names were quite forgotten after such a long absence. Stephen was remembered – if at all – as an infant prodigy violinist at Vauxhall Gardens, and found it very hard to secure paying work without the cherubic charm of youth behind him, and moreover as an unknown composer.\n\nBoth Nancy and Stephen imagined they might find work at the King's Theatre, which was – at that time – the home of the Royal Italian Opera, a troupe which enjoyed a Royal monopoly on the presentation of Italian opera, and in fact of any musical works which were through-composed without dialogue. Kelly succeeded in getting a few roles there (on the basis of his wider professional experience, knowing roles the King's Theatre already had in repertoire, and his legendary charm), but both Storaces found themselves excluded by the group of native Italian musicians already well-established there. Stephen too worked at the King's Theatre as music director for some operas, including his own \"La Cameriera Astuta\", before moving in 1789 to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, which at this time was under the management of Richard Brinsley Sheridan. Sheridan's personal interest in the theatre had largely dried-up by this point in his career, and he was more interested in politics – his theatrical interests were primarily financial, and he had established a successful format of lavish musical spectaculars, more remarkable for their visual than musical content. To evade the Royal monopoly on opera at the King's Theatre, Sheridan presented a mixture of Singspiel-type works specially written in English in the ballad-opera style, with \"English'd\" versions of popular operas playing in continental Europe in which he saw some commercial opportunity. Stephen Storace's first job at Drury Lane was to make an \"English\" version of Dittersdorf's German Singspiel \"Doktor und Apotheker\", which appeared in English as \"Doctor & Apothecary\" in 1787 in Storace's version. The work of making \"English\" versions was not just a question of translation – all complicated musical numbers (especially trios, quartets etc.) had to be \"cut\" to make them performable by English casts who were primarily pantomime comedians without any great musical talent. This also meant transposition of some numbers, making a fresh English text, cutting whole numbers and replacing them with dialogue, and sometimes inserting new comic songs and \"patter-songs\" which the public greatly enjoyed.\n\nStephen quickly established his credentials with Sheridan as a young man who could quickly and competently produce good results. He also had an impresario's skill for judging what would make good box-office and bring in good receipts, and he took to adding famous numbers from the Vienna stage to \"spice-up\" works which needed it. Seeing that the repertoire of the King's Theatre was still largely made-up of opera seria works about ancient gods or monarchs of antiquity, Storace spotted a niche in the market for the new \"romantic\" style of ghost-stories, gothic horror, and romance, and his first purpose-written work for Drury Lane employed all these elements. \"The Haunted Tower\" (1789) was a box-office sensation, selling out for 50 nights in succession. No little part of the success was the performance of Michael Kelly in the male lead role. Up to this time, high notes in the male parts in the theatre had been crooned falsetto by performers who were more actors than singers. Kelly's aria to the ghost of the Haunted Tower – \"Spirit of My Sainted Sire!\" included a top B which he took in full voice in the Italian style, and proved such a success that at most performances it was encored in full. This aria outlived the rest of Storace's output by decades, and was still being reprinted in parlour songbook anthologies for the amateur tenor a century later.\n\nHowever, \"The Haunted Tower\" still included \"borrowings\" from other composers on whose reputations tickets might be sold, and Sheridan remained adamant – despite the success of the piece – that he did not want Storace composing fresh work as a regular occurrence. Storace was put to work producing an \"English\" version of Gretry's \"Richard, Coeur du Lion\", with the unfortunate difficulty that John Bannister – the famous tragedian – was cast in the main role, and was tone-deaf. No amount of re-writing could get around the problem that Richard was supposed to sing his famous ballad so that Blondin would hear it outside the castle walls. As so often in Storace's life, he was saved by his friends. Michael Kelly was now established as the audience's favourite star after Bannister, and was given a Benefit Night in 1790 – by tradition, he could choose whatever piece he believed would bring in the best receipts at the box-office. At this period a \"programme\" at Drury Lane would always be a double-bill – a main work, and a one-act \"afterpiece\" which was usually a comedy. Kelly broke with tradition and risked his income by announcing – to Sheridan's disapproval – that instead of a popular favourite, he would premiere a new afterpiece by Storace, called \"No song, no supper\". \"No Song\" outsold even \"The Haunted Tower\", and proved the best-selling show at Drury Lane for the following decade. Nancy had appeared as a Guest Artist in \"The Haunted Tower\" – the success of \"No Song\" obliged Sheridan to take her \"onto the books\", and at last she secured a full-time engagement in Britain.\n\nIt seems likely that Storace had been working on an \"English\" version of Vicente Martín y Soler's (known as Martini) comedy \"Una cosa rara\" – an opera which had already been cited by Mozart in the final scene of \"Don Giovanni\". However, presumably at around the date of the \"No Song\" triumph, Storace abruptly discarded all of Martini's music in Acts II and III, and had librettist James Cobb produce an entirely new libretto, creating another \"romantic\" hit situated in the midst of the Ottoman-Austrian war of a few years earlier, \"The Siege of Belgrade\" (1791). From this point on Storace abandoned the ballad-opera style completely, and wrote the entire piece in the Mozartian \"Singspiel\" style. \"The Siege\" is remarkable for the extended ensemble numbers such as the Act I Trio for the Seraskier, Lilla and Ghita, \"Your passions thus deceiving\" – divided into allegro-andante-allegro sections. Alive to what the public cheered most, Storace included a bravura coloratura aria for Mrs Crouch as the imprisoned Austrian hostage, Princess Catherine, \"My plaint in no-one pity moves\"; a warlike Act III aria for Kelly as the \"noble Turk\"; and an extraordinary \"Queen of the Night\"-style dramatic-coloratura Act III aria for Nancy, \"Domestic Peace\", with a string of double-octave fast upward scales to top c<nowiki>\"</nowiki> over French-horn fanfares that brought the house down. The printed vocal score not only includes one of the famous \"scenery\" engravings, but cast a glove down to the King's Theatre – avoiding all euphemism the work is clearly described as \"an Opera, in three acts\".\n\nThe year 1792 saw Storace produce the boldest of his operatic projects, \"Dido, Queen of Carthage\", with a libretto by Prince Hoare after Metastasio's \"Didone abbandonata\". This was the only all-sung opera Storace produced in English – all his other works had spoken dialogue between the musical numbers. His sister regarded it as Stephen's finest work. However, for whatever reason, the piece proved unpopular with the public, and was withdrawn after a short run. The music was not thought worth printing commercially, with the result that not a note of this opera now survives, nor were any solo numbers from it printed separately.\n\n\"The Pirates\", also produced in 1792, was partly adapted from \"Gli Equivoci\", and is remarkable as affording one of the earliest instances of the introduction of a grand finale into an English opera. These works were followed by some less successful productions; but \"The Cherokee\" (1794) and \"The Three and the Deuce\" (1795) were very favourably received. \"The Cherokee\" did not, unlike \"The Siege of Belgrade\", attempt to add any \"exotic\" music for the Cherokee – their \"War March\" is disappointingly four-square and tonal, but the \"War Whoop\" is an exciting number. The work also introduced the public to the boy-treble star, \"Master Walsh\", whose coloratura talents must have been remarkable as his numbers are no less complex than Crouch's or Nancy Storace's. He was to figure regularly in Storace's works thereafter.\n\nStorace collaborated with Sheridan in bringing William Godwin's controversial novel \"Caleb Williams\" to the stage. In the light of the French Revolution, the work – about a faithful servant whose life is ruined by a vicious master – had gained considerable notoriety, and was produced under the title \"The Iron Chest\", first performed on 12 March 1796.\n\nStorace's final work was \"Mahmoud, Prince of Persia\", but he never saw the premiere.\n\nHe caught cold at rehearsals for \"The Iron Chest\", and died on 15 or 16 March 1796. He is buried in Marylebone Parish Church with a monument by the celebrated sculptor Thomas Banks.\n\nNancy Storace organised that the unfinished work was completed (Kelly claims to have had a hand in doing so, but it is more likely that he paid other hands to do it, since he freely admitted he could not read the bass clef. Most likely the work was finished and orchestrated by the Orchestra Leader, John Shaw, who was Kelly's collaborator on all his later projects). The work was given as a Benefit Performance for Storace's widow. \"Mahmoud\" survives, but it is clear that the completed version was very makeshift.\n\nStorace is also known to have been involved in preparing musical spectaculars for isolated events. It is intriguing to speculate what performances like \"The English Fleet in 1391\" may have resembled, but no details survive. He also wrote pieces \"to order\" for favourite performers at the Drury Lane Theatre, such as the musical comedian Richard \"Dicky\" Suett, for whom he wrote the musical farce \"My Grandmother\". Unfortunately we can only imagine the visual effect of numbers such as \"Dicky's Walk\", which must have accompanied some on-stage buffoonery of a greatly amusing nature.\n\nAlthough Storace's English operas were popular in their time, their failure to endure in performance is in part due to the financial caution of his employer, Sheridan. A legendarily shrewd man with money, Sheridan refused to allow any copies of the Storace's works to be circulated, for fear of pirate versions being performed from which no royalties would be paid. In fact history shows that Sheridan's best attempts failed, and pirated versions of Storace's works were playing in New York by the end of the century. However, it is assumed that the carefully guarded scores and parts perished in the Drury Lane Theatre Fire. His two Viennese operas have been preserved, but only one of his English operas survives complete in score and parts – \"No Song, No Supper\" (published in \"Musica Britannica\" editions, edited by Roger Fiske). The other works survive only in piano and voice vocal scores issued by Storace's publishers, Longman & Broderip. (A number of these scores were reprinted by Kalmus Edition in the 1970s in the USA, but all have been deleted and no details are available from Kalmus). The surviving vocal scores have clearly been prepared by an expert hand, and are extensively \"cued\" with the orchestral parts in smaller notes – it seems possible that Storace himself, or one of his closer assistants, must have prepared these vocal scores. There are, to date, no commercially available recordings of any of Storace's operas. Storace is not known to have written any exclusively instrumental music, other than the overtures for his operas.\n\nThe character of Storace's music is preeminently English; but his early intercourse with Mozart gave him an immense advantage over his contemporaries in his management of the orchestra, while for the excellence of his writing for the voice he was no doubt indebted to the vocalisation of his sister Ann (Nancy) Storace.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1959451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1959451", "title": "Arbutus unedo", "text": "Arbutus unedo\n\nArbutus unedo, the strawberry tree, is an evergreen shrub or small tree in the family Ericaceae, native to the Mediterranean region and western Europe north to western France and Ireland. Due to its presence in southwest and northwest Ireland, it is known as either \"Irish strawberry tree\", or cain or cane apple (from the Irish name for the tree, \"caithne\"), or sometimes Killarney strawberry tree.\n\nDespite the name \"strawberry tree\", it is not closely related to the common strawberry plant (\"Fragaria\" × \"ananassa\"). \n\n\"Arbutus unedo\" was one of the many species described by Carl Linnaeus in Volume One of his landmark 1753 work \"Species Plantarum\", giving it the name it still bears today.\n\nA study published in 2001 which analyzed ribosomal DNA from \"Arbutus\" and related genera found \"Arbutus\" to be paraphyletic, and \"A. unedo\" to be closely related to the other Mediterranean Basin species such as \"A. andrachne\" and \"A. canariensis\" and not to the western North American members of the genus.\n\n\"Arbutus unedo\" and \"A. andrachne\" hybridise naturally where their ranges overlap; the hybrid has been named \"Arbutus × andrachnoides\" (syn. \"A. × hybrida\", or \"A. andrachne × unedo\"), inheriting traits of both parent species, though fruits are not usually borne freely, and as a hybrid is unlikely to breed true from seed.\nIt is sold in California as Arbutus x Marina named for a district in San Francisco where it was hybridized.\n\n\"Arbutus unedo\" grows to tall, rarely up to , with a trunk diameter of up to . It grows in hardiness zones 7–10.\n\nThe leaves are dark green and glossy, long and broad, with a serrated margin.\n\nThe hermaphrodite flowers are white (rarely pale pink), bell-shaped, diameter, produced panicles of 10–30 together in autumn. They are pollinated by bees, and have a mild sweet scent.\n\nThe fruit is a red berry, diameter, with a rough surface. It matures in about 12 months, in autumn, at the same time as the next flowering. It is edible; the fruit is sweet when reddish. Seeds are often dispersed by frugivorous birds.\n\nThe name unedo is attributed to Pliny the Elder, who allegedly claimed that \"\"unum tantum edo\"\", meaning \"I eat only one\". It is not known whether he meant that the fruit was so good he could eat only one, or whether he meant that the fruit was uninteresting so he ate only one.\n\n\"Arbutus unedo\" is widespread in the Mediterranean region: in Portugal, Spain and southeastern France; southward in Algeria, Morocco, Libya, and Tunisia, and eastward in Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Greece, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria and Israel. It is also found in western France, Albania, Bulgaria and southwestern Ireland.\n\nIts disjunct distribution, with an isolated relict population in southwestern and northwestern Ireland, notably in Killarney and around Lough Gill in County Sligo, which is its most northerly stand in the world, is a remnant of former broader distribution during the milder climate of the Atlantic period, the warmest and moistest Blytt-Sernander period, when the climate was generally warmer than today. The red-flowered variant, named \"A. unedo rubra\" by William Aiton in 1785, was discovered growing wild in Ireland in 1835.\n\n\"Arbutus unedo\" is quite an easy plant to cultivate, and is adaptable to many climates. Once established it is fairly drought resistant, frost resistant, shade tolerant and salt tolerant.\n\nLower production of fruit mass has however been reported in case of summer droughts, and frosts in flowering time was seen to decrease the numbers of fruits.\n\n\"Arbutus unedo\" is naturally adapted to dry summer climates, and has become a very popular ornamental plant in California and the rest of the west coast of North America. It can grow easily in USDA hardiness zone 7 or warmer.\n\nIt also grows well in the cool, wet summers of western Ireland and England, and temperate regions of Europe and Asia. Pests include scales and thrips, and diseases include anthracnose, \"Phytophthora\", root rot, and rust.\n\nUnlike most of the Ericaceae, \"A. unedo\" grows well in basic (limy) pH soils, even though it does better in more acidic soils.\n\nThe fruit production is not very high and is highly variable on the weather, and that may be part of the reason this plant is not much cultivated. The average yield in a two years study is around 46 kg per hectare, and 180 grams per cubic metre of crown. However, very little work has so far been done in terms of genotype selection.\n\n\"Arbutus unedo\" has been seen to form a mycorrhizal relationship. Inoculation with \"Pisolithus tinctorius\" has shown to greatly improve the plants root mass, size, tolerance to drought and nutritional status.\n\nIn cultivation in the UK, the form \"A. unedo\" f. \"rubra\"\nand the cultivar ‘Atlantic’ \nhave gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit\n\nPropagation can be done via seed, layering, or cutting.\n\nThe seed should undergo a one month cold stratification period, then soaked for 5 to 6 days in warm water to improve germination success. Seedlings are prone to damp, and should be cared in the first year.\n\nGermination rate is low, rarely over 20%.\n\nLayering can take up to two years, but has a good success rate, while cutting is done with a long mature wood, preferably with a heel in November to December. The success rate however is not very high.\n\n\"Arbutus unedo\"'s fruits have a high content of sugars (40%), and antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin C, beta-carotene, niacin, tocopherols, and organic acids that are precursors to omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (nearly 9%). They are edible fresh, but that is an uncommon consumption, especially because the mature fruit tends to bruise very easily, making transportation difficult.\n\nThey are used mostly for jam, marmalades, yogurt and alcoholic beverages, such as the Portuguese \"medronho\", a type of strong brandy. Many regions of Albania prepare the traditional drink rakia from the fruits of the plant (mare or kocimare in Albanian), hence comes the name of the drink \"raki kocimareje\". In order to reduce the high content of methanol in the drink, the spirit is distilled twice.\n\nThe flowers are pollinated by bees, and the resulting honey is bitter tasting but still considered a delicacy.\n\n\"Arbutus unedo\"'s leaves have been employed in traditional and folk medicine in the form of a decoction having the following properties: astringent, diuretic, urinary anti-septic, antiseptic, intoxicant, rheumatism, tonic, and more recently, in the therapy of hypertension and diabetes.\n\nThe leaves are reported to have a high concentration of flavonol antioxidants, especially quercitin, best extracted with a decoction, and together with the fruits are a source of antioxidants.\n\nThe leaves also have anti-inflammatory properties\n\nIn landscape design, ecosystem restoration or permaculture based designs, \"A. unedo\" can have many purposes. While the ornamental one is the most common, this can be a valuable plant also for restoring degraded ecosystems and preventing desertification. Being a pioneer plant and growing well also in poor soils, can be used in a wide array of situations.\n\n\nIts Mediterranean habitat, elegant details of leaf and habit and dramatic show of fruit with flowers made \"Arbutus unedo\" notable in Classical Antiquity, when it was called Andrachne, and for which Theophrastos (4th c. BCE) wrote about it, as well as the ancient army medical herbalist Pedanios Dioscorides [De Materia Medica, Book II-150]; in addition, Pliny thought it should not be planted where bees are kept, for the bitterness it imparts to honey.\n\nThe first signs of its importation into northern European gardens was to 16th-century England from Ireland. In 1586 a correspondent in Ireland sent plants to the Elizabethan courtiers Lord Leicester and Sir Francis Walsingham. An earlier description by Rev. William Turner (\"The Names of Herbes\", 1548) was probably based on hearsay. The Irish association of \"Arbutus\" in English gardens is reflected in the inventory taken in 1649 of Henrietta Maria's Wimbledon: \"one very fayre tree, called the Irish arbutis standing in the midle parte of the sayd kitchin garden, very lovely to look upon\" By the 18th century \"Arbutus unedo\" was well known enough in English gardens for Batty Langley to make the bold and impractical suggestion that it might be used for hedges, though it \"will not admit of being clipped as other evergreens are.\"\n\nIn the United States, Thomas Jefferson lists the plant in his Monticello gardens in 1778.\n\nThe form \"A. unedo\" f. \"rubra\" and the hybrid \"A.\" × \"andrachnoides\", have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\nThe tree is mentioned by Roman poet Ovid, in Book I: 89–112 \"The Golden Age\" of his \"Metamorphoses\": \"Contented with food that grew without cultivation, they collected mountain strawberries and the fruit of the strawberry tree, wild cherries, blackberries clinging to the tough brambles, and acorns fallen from Jupiter’s spreading oak-tree.\"\n\nThe name of the Italian promontory Mount Conero, situated directly south of the port of Ancona on the Adriatic Sea, derives from the Greek name κόμαρος (komaròs) indicating the strawberry tree which is common on the slopes of the mountain. Mount Conero, the only coastal high point on the Adriatic sea between Trieste and the Gargano massif in the region of Apulia, assists navigators to sail across the Adriatic sea since ancient times.\n\n\"The Garden of Earthly Delights\", a painting by Hieronymus Bosch, was originally listed by José de Sigüenza, in the inventory of the Spanish Crown as \"La Pintura del Madroño\" – \"The Painting of the Strawberry Tree\".\n\nThe tree makes up part of the Coat of arms of Madrid (\"El oso y el madroño\", The Bear and the Strawberry Tree) of the city of Madrid, Spain. In the center of the city (Puerta del Sol) there is a statue of a bear eating the fruit of the \"Madroño\" tree. The image appears on city crests, taxi cabs, man-hole covers, and other city infrastructure. The fruit of the \"Madroño\" tree ferments on the tree if left to ripen, so some of the bears become drunk from eating the fruits. \n\nThe strawberry tree began to be considered one the national symbols of Italy in the 19th century, during the Italian unification, because with its autumn colors is reminiscent of the flag of Italy (green for its leaves, white for its flowers and red for its berries). \n\nFor this reason the poet Giovanni Pascoli dedicated a poem to the strawberry tree. He refers to the Aeneid passage in which Pallas, killed by Turnus, was posed on branches of a strawberry tree. He saw in the colours of that plant a prefiguration of the flag of Italy and considered Pallas the first \"national cause martyr\". Pascoli's ode says:\n\n\n\n"}

He played high school basketball for Prentiss High School in Mississippi before skipping college to enter the 2004 NBA draft, where he was drafted 15th overall by the Boston Celtics. He has previously played for the Celtics, Minnesota Timberwolves, Utah Jazz, Charlotte Hornets and Indiana Pacers.\n\nBorn in Monticello, Mississippi, Jefferson attended Prentiss High School in the small nearby town of Prentiss from 2000 to 2004. After starting for his varsity team as a freshman at Prentiss, he became one of the elite players in the country as a junior, drawing the attention of both college coaches around the country, and the scouts of the NBA. In his senior year for the Bulldogs, he averaged an astounding 42.6 points, 18 rebounds and seven blocks per game as his Bulldogs team went on to lose in the Mississippi state class 3A semi-finals to Byhalia High School 88–73, in which Jefferson finished with 56 points.\n\nConsidered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Jefferson was listed as the No. 1 center and the No. 4 player in the nation in 2004. He had originally committed to Arkansas, but opted instead to make the jump to the NBA straight out of high school.\n\nJefferson was drafted with the 15th overall pick by the Boston Celtics in the 2004 NBA draft, becoming the first high school player to be drafted by the Celtics (Kendrick Perkins was drafted by the Grizzlies, then traded to Boston on draft day in the 2003 NBA draft). He played primarily as a power forward and averaged 6.7 points and 4.4 rebounds in 14.8 minutes per game during his rookie season.\n\nJefferson's 2005–06 season was widely considered a disappointment, mostly due to a series of ankle injuries and a torn meniscus in his right knee which limited him to playing in 59 games. He averaged 7.9 points and 5.1 rebounds in 18.0 minutes per game during his sophomore season.\n\nIn the off-season prior to the 2006–07 season, Jefferson hired a personal chef and lost about 30 pounds. After experiencing lingering pain after participating in the Las Vegas Summer League, a CAT scan revealed bone spurs. On August 2, 2006, he underwent ankle surgery to remove the bone spurs. On November 8, 2006, prior to the fourth game of the season, Jefferson had appendectomy surgery at New England Baptist Hospital and subsequently missed seven games as he returned to the lineup on November 22, 2006.\n\nWhile already playing increased minutes (9.3 points and 7.0 rebounds in 22.0 minutes per game over nine games as a reserve), Jefferson's role expanded due to an injury to starting center Kendrick Perkins. With backup centers Michael Olowokandi and Theo Ratliff already on the injured list, Celtics' coach Doc Rivers started Jefferson at center on December 6, 2006 against the Memphis Grizzlies. Over the next seven games, Jefferson averaged 16.3 points and 11.1 rebounds in 33.7 minutes per game. In what some considered a breakout performance against the New Jersey Nets on December 9, 2006, he scored a career-high 29 points and grabbed 14 rebounds, which tied a career high (set on May 5, 2005 in a playoff game against the Indiana Pacers). It was the second time he had scored more than 20 points in a game. The previous occasion was on December 10, 2005 against the Dallas Mavericks where he scored 21 points. His third and fourth 20-point game came six and seven days after the second, on December 15 and December 16, when he scored 28 against the Denver Nuggets and 22 against the Charlotte Bobcats. These efforts punctuated a five-game win streak by the Boston Celtics.\n\nOn March 3, 2007, Jefferson scored a career-high 32 points to go along with 18 rebounds against the New Jersey Nets, against whom he had previously set his career high in points against earlier in the season. On March 5, Jefferson was named the NBA's Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the week starting February 26 through March 4.\n\nOn July 31, 2007, Jefferson was traded, along with Gerald Green, Ryan Gomes, Theo Ratliff, Sebastian Telfair and draft picks, to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Kevin Garnett. After landing in Minnesota, Jefferson quickly signed a large contract extension before the season. At $65 million over five years, it was satisfactory but he could have gotten a max deal. Instead he chose not to pursue one, due to \"having not really proved\" himself.\n\nIn his first season with the Timberwolves, Jefferson was the team's scoring leader. Playing in all 82 games, he ranked 20th in the NBA in points per game (11th in total points), averaging 21.0 points per game while shooting .500 from the field. Jefferson also defined himself as one of the premier big men in the NBA by being only one of four players to average 20 points and 10 rebounds (the others being Dwight Howard, Carlos Boozer and Antawn Jamison). Jefferson ranked 5th in the NBA in rebounding, averaging 11.1 (4th in total rebounds) and 2nd in offensive rebounds per game (3.8), only behind Tyson Chandler (4.1). Jefferson is ranked 12th in the NBA efficiency and is 3rd in the NBA in double-doubles.\n\nIn January 2008, Jefferson won Western Conference Player of the Week honors after averaging 33.3 points and 15.3 rebounds and leading the Timberwolves to a 3–1 record from January 21 to 27.\n\nJefferson scored a career-high 40 points against the New Jersey Nets on January 27, 2008 and repeated such a performance against the Charlotte Bobcats on April 8, 2008.\n\nJefferson was having a career best year, averaging 23.1 points, 11.0 rebounds and 1.7 blocks per game in the first 50 games of the season, until suffering a serious right knee injury after landing awkwardly on one leg in a game at New Orleans. Jefferson claimed that he felt a pop in his knee and the injury resulted in a complete tear to the ACL which required reconstructive surgery that ended his season. At the time the Wolves were 17–33 and showing signs of improvement, but with Jefferson out, they went 7–25 over their remaining games, and were a lottery team once again.\n\nOn January 13, 2010, Jefferson set a single-game franchise record with 26 rebounds in a triple overtime loss to the Houston Rockets. The record was later surpassed by Kevin Love in November 2010.\n\nComing off knee surgery, Jefferson had a solid season in 2009–10 as he played 76 games while averaging 17.1 points, 9.3 rebounds and a career-high 1.8 assists in 32.4 minutes per game.\n\nOn July 13, 2010, Jefferson was traded to the Utah Jazz for two future first round picks and center Kosta Koufos. With the chance to play alongside All-Star point guard Deron Williams, Jefferson couldn't be happier, but his first season in Utah brought numerous ups and downs. The in-season departures of Williams and coach Jerry Sloan were a shock to the system, but Jefferson didn't back away from the challenges. Instead, he saw the need for a new leader and stepped up to become part of the foundation for a young team to build on.\n\nIn what was an injury-riddled season for the Jazz, Jefferson started in all 82 games during the regular season and regained some of his explosiveness in 2011, showing he was fully recovered from the devastating knee injury he suffered in 2009. His return to form contributed 37 double-doubles during the season and 794 total rebounds – the second highest total of his career. He finished the 2010–11 season with averages of 18.6 points and 9.7 rebounds per game.\n\nIn the lockout shortened 2011–12 season, Jefferson furthered his improvement, transitioning into his role as team leader while continuing to put up the impressive numbers that have become common for him. He showed energy and tenacity all season as well as an improved defensive game, and heading into the All-Star break, many were calling for him to be selected to his first All-Star team, including Brian T. Smith of \"The Salt Lake Tribune\" who noted, \"If the Jazz keep winning during January and Jefferson keeps producing, the eight-year veteran could finally be in the running for an All-Star spot.\"\n\nDespite not receiving an All-Star selection, Jefferson ended the season tied for seventh in the league with 31 double doubles and led his team back to the playoffs. Behind Jefferson's strong season, the young Jazz finished 36-30 and secured the eighth seed in the West where they faced the San Antonio Spurs in the first round. While Jefferson did his best to contain Spurs' superstar Tim Duncan, Utah simply couldn't measure up against San Antonio. The Spurs swept the Jazz in four games and would eventually go on to reach the conference finals.\n\nThroughout the 2012–13 season, Jefferson was the driving force for the Jazz, leading the team again in scoring and rebounding and finishing in the top ten in the league in double doubles yet again with 37 compiled throughout the course of the season. He posted a career-high 40 points late in the season against the Minnesota Timberwolves and was poised to be the catalyst for the Jazz to make a return trip to the playoffs. Unfortunately, the Jazz narrowly missed out on returning to the playoffs, falling just two games shy of the No. 8 seed with a 43–39 record. Despite the season ending early, Jefferson again established himself as a force down low and figured to be one of the most valued free agents heading into the offseason.\n\nOn July 10, 2013, Jefferson signed a three-year, $40.5 million contract with the Charlotte Bobcats. However, despite the big contract with a new team, Jefferson's arrival was delayed by a right ankle sprain that caused him to miss the entire preseason and nine of the team's first 12 games. Though he was slowed by the ankle injury, upon his return, Jefferson showed glimpses of promise while working himself back into rhythm as by the time January rolled around, he was finally healthy and ready to dominate. On January 31, 2014, Jefferson tied a career high with 40 points in a win against the Los Angeles Lakers. He continued his high level of play en route to winning the Eastern Conference Player of the Month for his performance in March 2014. He averaged 24.7 points and 10.6 rebounds while shooting 55% from the floor during the month of March, and went on to win the Eastern Conference Player of the Month for April 2014 as well.\nOn April 20, 2014, Jefferson suffered a plantar fasciitis injury during Game 1 of the Bobcats' first round playoff series against the Miami Heat and later missed Game 4 because of the injury. On June 4, 2014, Jefferson was named to the 2014 All-NBA third team.\n\nAfter kicking back into form in 2013–14 with his best averages since 2008–09, Jefferson continued to thrive with the young, newly named Charlotte Hornets in 2014–15. On November 7, 2014, Jefferson scored a season-high 34 points in the Hornets' 122–119 double overtime win over the Atlanta Hawks to move to a record of 3–3. Despite the great win and a promising start to the season, the Hornets went on to lose the next 12 out of 13 games, with a 10-game losing streak expanding from November 15 to December 3. The team finally broke the streak on December 5 against the New York Knicks, as Jefferson recorded 16 points and 13 rebounds in the 103–102 win.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of the Hornets' 104–86 win over the Utah Jazz on December 20, Jefferson had nearly registered his third straight game with at least 20 points and 10 rebounds but left the game with six minutes remaining with a mild groin strain and did not return. In 27 minutes of action, he recorded 19 points and 10 rebounds. Despite the injury scare, Jefferson played the following game against the Denver Nuggets on December 22, recording 22 points and 7 rebounds to help the Hornets win their third straight game. His recurring groin injury flared up again on December 29 against the Milwaukee Bucks as he left the game during the fourth quarter and did not return after managing just 6 points and 8 rebounds. The Hornets went on to lose the game in overtime. He was subsequently ruled out for four weeks the following day after he was diagnosed with a strained adductor muscle in his left groin. After missing nine games with the injury, Jefferson returned on January 19, recording 8 points and 5 rebounds in a Hornets win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. Coming off the bench, it marked the first time since December 4, 2006 – a span of 544 games – that Jefferson didn't start in a game in which he played. He came off the bench for a further three games before reclaiming his starting spot on January 28 against San Antonio and subsequently recorded 17 points and 16 rebounds in a loss to the Spurs.\n\nOn March 11, in a loss to the Sacramento Kings, Jefferson left the game late in the third quarter due to a strained right calf after managing 9 points and 6 rebounds in 24 minutes of action. He returned after sitting out one game to score 10 points in a blowout loss to the Utah Jazz. On March 22, he recorded his 20th double-double of the season with 18 points and a team-high 11 rebounds in a 109–98 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nOn June 15, 2015, Jefferson exercised his player option with the Hornets for the 2015–16 season.\n\nJefferson averaged just 12.8 points and 7.3 rebounds over the Hornets' first four games of the 2015–16 season, with the team winning just one of those four games. He found his rhythm on November 5 against the Dallas Mavericks, recording 31 points and 9 rebounds to help lead the Hornets to a 108–94 win. On November 20, he recorded his third double-double of the season with 26 points, 10 rebounds and a season-high 5 blocks in a 113–88 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. On November 29, he exited the Hornets' game against the Milwaukee Bucks with a left calf strain with 5:09 remaining in the first quarter, and did not return.\n\nOn December 9, 2015, Jefferson was suspended without pay for five games for violating the terms of the NBA/NBPA Anti-Drug Program. He missed 11 games between December 2 and December 23 due to injury and suspension, returning to action on December 26 against the Memphis Grizzlies, coming off the bench for the first time since January 24, 2015. He finished with two points on 1-of-8 shooting and four rebounds in 17 minutes, and fouled out with 8:10 remaining in the fourth quarter. He managed just two games following his suspension before a tear in the lateral meniscus of his right knee was discovered on December 30. The injury subsequently ruled him out for six weeks. Jefferson returned to action on February 19 after missing 22 games. He scored six points and grabbed five rebounds in 23 minutes off the bench in a 98–95 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. In the team's regular season finale on April 13, Jefferson scored 26 points off the bench in a 117–103 win over the Orlando Magic, helping the Hornets finish as the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference with a 48–34 record.\n\nIn Game 2 of the Hornets' first round playoff series match-up with the Miami Heat, Jefferson scored 16 second-quarter points to finish with 25 on 12-of-17 shooting off the bench in a 115–103 loss. The Hornets went on to lose the series in seven games.\n\nOn July 9, 2016, Jefferson signed a three-year, $30 million contract with the Indiana Pacers. He made his debut for the Pacers in their season opener on October 26, 2016, recording seven points and six rebounds off the bench in a 130–121 overtime win over the Dallas Mavericks. After averaging just 5.7 points per game over the first seven games of the 2016–17 season, Jefferson scored a season-high 18 points on November 9 against the Philadelphia 76ers. On January 18, 2017, he set a new season high with 20 points against the Sacramento Kings. Two days later against the Los Angeles Lakers, Jefferson had his second straight 20-point game. Jefferson missed the final eight games of the regular season with a sprained left ankle.\n\nOn November 8, 2017, Jefferson had a 19-point effort against the Detroit Pistons. On March 15, 2018, he scored a season-high 20 points to go with a season-high 12 rebounds in a 106–99 loss to the Toronto Raptors.\n\nOn July 2, 2018, Jefferson was waived by the Pacers.\n\nIn July 2018, Jefferson signed with the Xinjiang Flying Tigers of the Chinese Basketball Association. He left the team in November 2018. In 10 games, he averaged 15.1 points, 7.5 rebounds and 1.1 assists per game.\n\nOn March 23, 2019, Jefferson announced his retirement from the NBA. Earlier that month, he signed to play in the BIG3.\n\n"}

{"id": "1959464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1959464", "title": "Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room", "text": "Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room\n\nEnron: The Smartest Guys in the Room is a 2005 American documentary film based on the best-selling 2003 book of the same name by \"Fortune\" reporters Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind, a study of one of the largest business scandals in American history. McLean and Elkind are credited as writers of the film alongside the director, Alex Gibney.\n\nThe film examines the 2001 collapse of the Enron Corporation, which resulted in criminal trials for several of the company's top executives during the ensuing Enron scandal; it also shows the involvement of the Enron traders in the California electricity crisis. The film features interviews with McLean and Elkind, as well as former Enron executives and employees, stock analysts, reporters and the former Governor of California Gray Davis.\n\nThe film won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary Feature and Best Documentary Screenplay from the Writers Guild of America. It was also nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 78th Academy Awards in 2006.\n\nThe film begins with a profile of Kenneth Lay, who founded Enron in 1985. Two years after its founding, the company becomes embroiled in scandal after two traders begin betting on the oil markets, resulting in suspiciously consistent profits. One of the traders, Louis Borget, is also discovered to be diverting company money to offshore accounts. After auditors uncover their schemes, Lay encourages them to \"keep making us millions\". However, the traders are fired after it is revealed that they gambled away Enron's reserves; the company is narrowly saved from bankruptcy by the timely intervention of executive Mike Muckleroy, who managed to bluff the market long enough to recover Borget's trading losses and prevent a margin call. After these facts are brought to light, Lay denies having any knowledge of wrongdoing.\n\nLay hires Jeffrey Skilling, a visionary who joins Enron on the condition that they use mark-to-market accounting, allowing the company to record potential profits on certain projects immediately after contracts were signed, regardless of the actual profits that the deal would generate. This gives Enron the ability to subjectively give the appearance of being a profitable company even if it wasn't. With the vision of transforming Enron from an energy supplier to an energy trader, Skilling imposes his interpretation of Darwinian worldview on Enron by establishing a review committee that grades employees and annually fires the bottom fifteen percent, a process nicknamed within the company as \"rank and yank\". This creates a highly competitive and brutal working environment. Skilling hires lieutenants who enforce his directives inside Enron, known as the \"guys with spikes.\" They include J. Clifford Baxter, an intelligent but manic-depressive executive; and Lou Pai, the CEO of Enron Energy Services, who is notorious for using shareholder money to feed his obsessive habit of visiting strip clubs. Pai abruptly resigns from EES with $250 million, soon after selling his stock. Despite the amount of money Pai has made, the divisions he formerly ran lost $1 billion, a fact covered up by Enron. Pai uses his money to buy a large ranch in Colorado, becoming the second-largest landowner in the state.\n\nWith its success in the bull market brought on by the dot-com bubble, Enron seeks to beguile stock market analysts by meeting their projections. Executives push up their stock prices and then cash in their multimillion-dollar options, a process known as \"pump and dump\". Enron also mounts a PR campaign to portray itself a profitable, prosperous and innovative company, even though its worldwide operations are performing poorly. Elsewhere, Enron begins ambitious initiatives such as attempts to use broadband technology to deliver movies on demand, and \"trade weather\" like a commodity; both initiatives fail. However, using mark-to-market accounting, Enron records non-existent profits for these ventures. CFO Andrew Fastow creates a network of shell companies designed solely to do business with Enron, for the ostensible dual purposes of sending Enron money and hiding its increasing debt. Fastow also takes advantage of the greed of Wall Street investment banks, pressuring them into investing in these shell entities. However, Fastow has a vested financial stake in these ventures, using them to defraud Enron of tens of millions of dollars in business deals that Fastow effectively conducts with himself. All of this done with the permission of Enron's accounting firm Arthur Andersen and the corporate board. Most of these deals were leveraged with Enron stock, meaning that a significant decline in Enron's stock price could cause Fastow's network of shell companies to fall apart. During this time, Enron's executives encourage the company's employees to invest their savings and retirement funds into Enron stock while they are selling off their shares for millions.\n\nEnron's successes continue as it became one of the few Internet-related companies to survive the burst of the dot-com bubble in 2000 relatively unscathed, and is named as the \"most admired\" corporation by \"Fortune\" magazine for the sixth year running. However, Jim Chanos, an Enron investor, and Bethany McLean, a \"Fortune\" reporter, question irregularities about the company's financial statements and stock value. Skilling responds by calling McLean \"unethical\", and accusing \"Fortune\" of publishing her reporting to counteract a positive \"BusinessWeek\" piece on Enron. Three Enron executives meet with McLean and her \"Fortune\" editor to explain the company's finances. However, public perception of Enron is changed dramatically due to its role in the California energy crisis: Enron traders exploited the shaky foundation of the state's newly deregulated energy market by shutting down power plants and exporting power out of the state to create artificial shortages that would drive up the cost of electricity to Enron's benefit; Enron would make $2 billion off of the crisis. The film plays tape recorded conversations between Enron traders who seemed to derive enjoyment from their exploitation of the crisis and then cites the Milgram experiment as a means of explaining their behavior. It also explores the strong political connections Ken Lay and Enron had, particularly to the administrations of 41st President George H. W. Bush and his son, Texas governor and later 43rd President George W. Bush, and suggests that Enron's actions during the California energy crisis could have been intended as a means of sabotaging California governor Gray Davis, who was being speculated as a strong potential challenger to Bush in the 2004 Presidential election. Indeed, the crisis would indirectly lead to Davis being recalled in 2003, which ended his political career. Skilling, who by then had succeeded Lay as Enron's CEO, blames California's energy laws for the crisis and denies that Enron is acting inappropriately, infamously stating on a 2001 episode of \"Frontline\", \"We are the good guys; we are on the side of angels.\" While the Bush administration refuses to intervene, which the film suggests could have been a result of Enron's influence, the opposition-controlled Senate ends the crisis by imposing price controls. Bush's connections to Ken Lay come under scrutiny by the press, which intensifies after Enron's collapse.\n\nMeanwhile, throughout 2001 much more scrutiny is brought upon Enron's balance sheet and this agitates CEO Skilling, who was on the verge of a nervous breakdown as the company and its fraud start to unravel. He engages in odd and irrational behavior - such as calling an investor an \"asshole\" during a conference call when asked why Enron isn't as transparent about its finances as its competitors - which culminates in his abrupt resignation as CEO in August 2001 in which Ken Lay retakes the position. Skilling's odd behavior serves as a red flag to investors who begin to question how financially healthy the company really is and start selling their shares; Enron's stock price begins to rapidly decline. Immediately after Skilling's departure, whistleblower Sherron Watkins, who had just recently discovered the fraud in Enron's books, alerts Lay and tells him that the company is headed to certain collapse unless he acts immediately. Like in 1987, Lay largely ignores Watkins' warnings and assures employees and the public that Skilling left for personal reasons and that the company was financially solid. At the same time, the board fires CFO Fastow after discovering that he had embezzled more than $30 million from the company through his shell companies. With Fastow gone, Enron's accountants issue a series of restatements that erase a majority of the company's profits from 1997 through 2000, adds nearly $1 billion of debt to the company's balance sheet, and removes over $1 billion of shareholder equity as a means of writing down the losses from Fastow's shell companies. Despite Lay's continued assurances that Enron is in good shape and will pull through, the company's stock price tanks as its investors and customers lose all confidence and Enron is forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2001.\n\nAs a result of Enron's bankruptcy, many of its employees lose their pensions and life savings, while investors lose over $11 billion in shareholder value. Congressional hearings are held into the scandal, where Ken Lay and Andrew Fastow plead the fifth. Fastow eventually pleads guilty in a deal that he will testify against his former coworkers in exchange for a reduced sentence, while Lay and Skilling plea innocent and spend tens of millions of dollars on defense attorneys.\n\nUpon release, \"Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room\" was met with strongly positive reviews. The film has a \"Certified Fresh\" rating of 97% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 117 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The site's consensus states: \"A concise, entertaining documentary about the spectacular failure of Enron.\" On Metacritic, it has a \"Universal Acclaim\" rating of 82%, based on 37 reviews.\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert, writing in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", gave the documentary three-and-a-half out of four stars, commenting that, \"This is not a political documentary. It is a crime story. No matter what your politics, \"Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room\" will make you mad\". Ebert's co-host on the television program \"Ebert & Roeper\", \"Chicago Tribune\" critic Richard Roeper, said that the documentary was \"a brilliantly executed, brutally entertaining dissection of what one observer called the greatest corporate fraud in American history.\" A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" called the film a \"sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining.\" Owen Gleiberman wrote: \"A nimble investigative workout that leaves you with the exhilarated sensation of understanding the defining financial scandal of the virtual era.\"\n\nThe film won Best Documentary Screenplay from the Writers Guild of America and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 78th Academy Awards in 2006, but lost to \"March of the Penguins\".\n\n\n"}

His books include \"War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning\" (2002), a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction; \"Empire of Illusion: The End of Literacy and the Triumph of Spectacle\" (2009); \"Death of the Liberal Class\" (2010); \"Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt\" (2012), written with cartoonist Joe Sacco, which was a \"New York Times\" best-seller; \"Wages of Rebellion: The Moral Imperative of Revolt\" (2015); and his most recent \"America: The Farewell Tour\" (2018).\n\nHedges was a columnist for the progressive news and commentary website Truthdig. He hosts the program \"On Contact\" for the RT (formerly Russia Today) television network. Hedges spent nearly two decades as a foreign correspondent in Central America, West Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and the Balkans. He has reported from more than fifty countries, and has worked for \"The Christian Science Monitor\", NPR, \"Dallas Morning News\", and \"The New York Times\", where he was a foreign correspondent for fifteen years (1990–2005).\n\nIn 2001, Hedges contributed to \"The New York Times\" staff entry that received the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting for the paper's coverage of global terrorism. He also received the Amnesty International Global Award for Human Rights Journalism in 2002. He has taught at Columbia University, New York University, the University of Toronto and Princeton University, where he is a visiting lecturer in African American studies.\n\nHedges has taught college credit courses for several years in New Jersey prisons. He teaches a course through Princeton University in which the class is composed of half prisoners and half Princeton undergraduates. He has described himself as a socialist and more specifically as a Christian anarchist, identifying with Catholic activist Dorothy Day in particular.\n\nChristopher Lynn Hedges was born in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, the son of Thelma Louise (\"née\" Prince) and the Rev. Thomas Havard Hedges, a Presbyterian minister. He grew up in rural Schoharie County, New York, southwest of Albany. He graduated in 1975 from the Loomis Chaffee School, a private boarding school in Windsor, Connecticut. He founded an underground newspaper at the school that was banned by the administration and resulted in his being put on probation.\n\nHedges received his Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Colgate University in 1979. He received a Master of Divinity degree from Harvard University's Divinity School (where he studied under James Luther Adams) in 1983. He studied Latin and Classical Greek at Harvard and speaks Arabic, French, and Spanish in addition to English.\n\nHedges worked for 15 years as a foreign correspondent for \"The New York Times\". He was based in the Middle East for five years, serving for four of those years as the Middle East bureau chief. He covered the war in the former Yugoslavia as the Balkan bureau chief based in Sarajevo. He later covered Al Qaeda in Europe and the Middle East from Paris.\n\nThree of Hedges' articles were based upon the stories of Iraqi defectors, who had been furnished to Hedges by the Information Collection Program of the U.S.-funded Iraqi National Congress. The program promoted stories to major media outlets in order to orchestrate U.S. intervention in Iraq in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Most significant of his reports in this period was a November 8, 2001, front-page story about two former Iraqi military commanders who claimed to have trained foreign mujahedeen how to hijack planes without using guns. Hedges quoted a man whom he believed to be an Iraqi general: \"These Islamic radicals ... came from a variety of countries, including Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Algeria, Egypt, and Morocco. We were training these people to attack installations important to the United States\". The two defectors also asserted there was a secret compound in Salman Pak facility where a German scientist was producing biological weapons.\n\nAccording to Jack Fairweather in \"Mother Jones\": \"The impact of the article ... was immediate: Op-eds ran in major papers, and the story was taken to a wider audience through cable-TV talk shows. When Condoleezza Rice, then President George W. Bush's national security adviser, was asked about the report at a press briefing, she said, 'I think it surprises no one that Saddam Hussein is engaged in all kinds of activities that are destabilizing. As late as 2006, according to Fairweather in the same article, conservative magazines including \"The Weekly Standard\" and \"National Review\" continued to use this article to justify the invasion of Iraq.\n\nIt later was revealed that the story which Hedges reported was \"an elaborate scam\". The defector whom Hedges quoted, who had identified himself as Lt. General Jamal al-Ghurairy, was a former sergeant. The real Ghurairy had never left Iraq. Hedges said that he had taken on reporting this account at the request of Lowell Bergman of \"Frontline\", who wanted the defectors for his show but could not go to Beirut for the interview. The trip had been organized by Ahmed Chalabi, whom Hedges considered to be unreliable. Hedges said he had done the piece as a favor to Bergman, explaining, \"There has to be a level of trust between reporters. We cover each other's sources when it's a good story because otherwise everyone would get hold of it.\" Hedges had relied on the U.S. embassy in Turkey for further confirmation of the man's identity.\n\nHedges wrote two more articles that year that were informed by Chalabi-coached defectors. The second one, claiming that Iraq still held 80 Kuwaitis captured in the 1991 Gulf War in a secret underground prison, was also found to be baseless.\n\nHedges was an early critic of the Iraq War. In May 2003, he delivered a commencement address at Rockford College in Rockford, Illinois, saying: \"We are embarking on an occupation that, if history is any guide, will be as damaging to our souls as it will be to our prestige and power and security.\" His speech was received with boos and his microphone was shut off three minutes after he began speaking.\n\"The New York Times,\" his employer, criticized his statements and issued him a formal reprimand for \"public remarks that could undermine public trust in the paper's impartiality\". Shortly after the incident, Hedges left \"The New York Times\" to become a senior fellow at The Nation Institute, and a columnist at Truthdig, in addition to writing books and teaching inmates at a New Jersey correctional institution.\n\nHedges has worked for a decade teaching in prisons in New Jersey, and he has become a fierce critic of mass incarceration in the United States.\n\nIn the 2008 United States presidential campaign, Hedges was a speech writer for candidate Ralph Nader.\n\nIn March 2008, Hedges published a book titled \"I Don't Believe in Atheists\", in which he expresses his belief that new atheism presents a danger that is similar to religious extremism.\n\nIn his December 29, 2008, column for Truthdig, Hedges stated that \"[t]he inability to articulate a viable socialism has been our gravest mistake. It will ensure, if this does not soon change, a ruthless totalitarian capitalism\". He elaborated upon this in a 2013 interview with The Real News, claiming that, \"the left has been destroyed, especially the radical left, quite consciously in the whole name of anti-communism\", and:\nIn a March 2009 column, Hedges warned that human over-population and mass species extinction are serious problems, and that any measures to save the ecosystem will be futile unless we cut population growth, and noted that, \"As long as the Earth is viewed as the personal property of the human race, a belief embraced by everyone from born-again Christians to Marxists to free-market economists, we are destined to soon inhabit a biological wasteland.\"\n\nOn December 8, 2009, Hedges identified as a \"radical Keynesian\" during his lecture at The New School, entitled \"Empire of Illusion\".\n\nOn December 16, 2010, he was arrested outside the White House along with Daniel Ellsberg and more than 100 activists who were protesting the war in Afghanistan.\n\nHedges appeared as a guest on an October 2011 episode of the CBC News Network's \"Lang and O'Leary Exchange\" to discuss his support for the Occupy Wall Street protests; co-host Kevin O'Leary criticized him, saying that he sounded \"like a left-wing nutbar\". Hedges said \"it will be the last time\" he appears on the show, and compared the CBC to Fox News. CBC's ombudsman found O'Leary's heated remarks to be a violation of the public broadcaster's journalistic standards.\n\nOn November 3, 2011, Hedges was arrested with others in New York as part of the Occupy Wall Street demonstration, during which the activists staged a \"people's hearing\" on the activities of the investment bank Goldman Sachs and blocked the entrance to their corporate headquarters. Hedges has appeared on the syndicated \"Democracy Now!\" television program; on \"Breaking the Set\" on RT (formerly known as Russia Today), and on CBC's \"George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight\".\n\nIn October 2012, Hedges publicly supported Jill Stein, the candidate of the Green Party of the United States, in the 2012 United States presidential election. On April 7, 2013, Hedges delivered the keynote address at the Green Party of New Jersey state convention.<ref name=\"Green Party to livestream Chris Hedges keynote at NJ GP annual meeting, Sun. 4/9\"></ref>\n\nIn June 2013, Hedges and numerous celebrities appeared in a video showing support for Chelsea Manning.\n\nOn September 20, 2014, a day before the People's Climate March, Hedges joined Bernie Sanders, Naomi Klein, Bill McKibben, and Kshama Sawant on a panel moderated by WNYC's Brian Lehrer to discuss the issue of climate change. Hedges and Klein also participated in the 'Flood Wall Street' protests that occurred shortly thereafter.\n\nOn November 11, 2014, Hedges published an article explaining why he and his family have become vegan. He explained that this is \"the most important and direct change we can immediately make to save the planet and its species\".\n\nIn a December 15, 2014, article, Hedges compared the actions of ISIS today to the way Israel's founding fathers acted in the late 1940s.\n\nHe contended at the Left Forum in 2015 that with the \"denouement of capitalism and the disintegration of globalism\", Karl Marx has been \"vindicated as capitalism's most prescient and important critic\". He said that Marx \"foresaw that capitalism had built within it the seeds of its own destruction. He knew that reigning ideologies—think neoliberalism—were created to serve the interests of the elites and in particular the economic elites.\"\n\nOn April 15, 2016, Hedges was arrested, along with 100 other protesters, during a sit-in outside the U.S. Capitol during Democracy Spring to protest the capture of the political system by corporations.\n\nCommenting on the 2016 election during an interview on The Real News, Hedges asserted that the modern American Left's embrace of neoliberalism resulted in a dysfunctional democracy and has given rise to a Trump presidency, which he characterizes as \"proto-fascist\". Hedges argues that logical result of neoliberalism is neofascism. At a March 2017 speech delivered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Hedges insisted that resistance to the Trump Administration must be broadly socialist and anti-capitalist in nature:\nThis resistance must also be accompanied by an alternative vision of a socialist, anti-capitalist society. Because the enemy in the end is not Trump or Bannon—it is corporate power. And if we do not stop corporate power, we will never dismantle fascism's seduction of the white working class and unemployed.\"\n\nOn May 27, 2020, Hedges announced that he would run as a Green Party candidate in New Jersey's 12th congressional district for the 2020 elections. However, he was informed the following day that he cannot run for a federal office because of FCC regulations.\n\nIn 2012, after the Obama Administration signed the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, Hedges sued members of the U.S. government, asserting that section 2021 of the law unconstitutionally allowed presidential authority for indefinite detention without \"habeas corpus\". He was later joined in the suit, \"Hedges v. Obama\", by activists including Noam Chomsky and Daniel Ellsberg. In May 2012 Judge Katherine B. Forrest of the Southern District of New York ruled that the counter-terrorism provision of the NDAA is unconstitutional. The Obama administration appealed the decision and it was overturned. Hedges petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case, but the Supreme Court denied certiorari in April 2014.\n\nOn October 5, 2014, Hedges was ordained a minister within the Presbyterian Church. He was installed as Associate Pastor and Minister of Social Witness and Prison Ministry at the Second Presbyterian Church Elizabeth in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He noted having been rejected for ordination 30 years earlier, saying that \"going to El Salvador as a reporter was not something the Presbyterian Church at the time recognized as a valid ministry, and a committee rejected my 'call.\n\nHedges is married to the Canadian actress Eunice Wong. The couple have two children. Hedges also has two children from a previous marriage. He currently lives in Princeton, New Jersey.\n\n\n\n"}

Leading members included Mikael Wiehe and Björn Afzelius.\n\nThe Hoola Bandoola Band is also mentioned in Lynne Truss' book \"Going Loco\", published in 1999.\n\nHoola Bandoola Band, along with Nationalteatern, was the biggest band of the Swedish progg movement. Whereas Nationalteatern put socially realistic lyrics to rock melodies, Hoola Bandoola had more politically charged lyrics and diverged further from traditional rock. \n\nThe name is most likely inspired by the fictional language spoken by ants in the Donald Duck cartoon \"Tea for Two Hundred\".\n\nThe band was formed in 1970. In 1971 they had their first radio hit and were immediately contacted by two record companies, one commercial and the alternative MNW. In the political climate of the 1970s, the choice of a company was crucial, and by choosing an alternative company, Hoola Bandoola came to be the most well known band on the alternative side in Sweden. \n\nTheir debut in 1971, \"Garanterat individuell\" (\"Guaranteed Individual\"), was hailed as the start of a new era for Swedish pop and was voted album of the year. This first album was not very political, but on the second album \"Vem kan man lita på?\" (\"Whom can one trust\"?), released the next year, the socialist message was much more pronounced. It included hits such as \"Keops pyramid\".\n\nWith \"På Väg\" (\"On the Way\"), recorded with a balalaika orchestra, Hoola Bandoola became one of the best-selling groups in Sweden. In 1975 they released a fourth album \"Fri information\" (\"Free Information\"), where the socialist message was more outspoken than ever before. With this album, Afzelius wrote half of the songs (Wiehe wrote most songs in previous albums). \n\nIn 1975, the alternative movement gathered in opposition to a tennis match played between Sweden and Chile, which at the time was under the military dictatorship of Pinochet. For that event, Hoola Bandoola released \"Stoppa matchen\" (\"Stop the Match\") as a single. This was their last studio recording. In 1976, the band broke up and Wiehe and Afzelius started very successful careers as singer/songwriters, both together and by themselves. \n\nAfter 20 years' absence, Hoola Bandoola reunited in 1996, playing warmup for Bob Dylan and going on their own nationwide tour playing over 50 shows with a total of over 200,000 people attending the tour. Recordings from this tour were released in 1999 after the death of Björn Afzelius on the album \"För dom som kommer sen\" (\"For Those Who Come Later\"). Each year on the anniversary of Afzelius' death, an award is given out to a person who has \"done work in the spirit of Björn Afzelius\".\n\nIn August 2011 the band played at the \"Malmö festival\", promoting their new double CD.\n\n"}

The bark on young trees is smooth, grey, and with resin blisters, becoming orange-red, rough and fissured on old trees. The leaves are needle-like, 2–3.5 cm long, glaucous blue-green above and below with strong stomatal bands, and an acute tip. They are arranged spirally on the shoot, but twisted slightly s-shaped to be upcurved above the shoot.\n\nThe cones are erect, 9–21 cm long, yellow-green (occasionally purple), ripening brown and disintegrating to release the winged seeds in fall.\n\nThere are two, perhaps three varieties:\n\nRed fir is very closely related to noble fir (\"Abies procera\"), which replaces it further north in the Cascade Range.

The formula for calculating 30-day yield is specified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The formula translates the bond fund's current portfolio income into a standardized yield for reporting and comparison purposes. A bond fund's 30-day yield may appear in the fund's \"Statement of Additional Information (SAI)\" in its prospectus.\n\nBecause the 30-day yield is a standardized mandatory calculation for all United States bond funds, it serves as a common ground comparison of yield performance. Its weakness lies in the fact that funds tend to trade actively and do not hold bonds until maturity. In addition, funds do not mature. For this reason, analysts often consider a distribution yield to be a better measure of a fund's income-generating potential.\n\nUnited States money market funds report a 7 Day SEC Yield. The rate expresses how much the fund would yield if it paid income at the same level as it did in the prior 7 days for a whole year. It is calculated by taking the sum of the income paid out over the period divided by 7, and multiplying that quantity by 36500 (365 days x 100).\n\nThe SEC yield calculation for a bond fund is essentially an annualized version of the interest and dividends per share earned over the last month, divided by the share price. It is not the same as the yield to maturity for the bonds in the portfolio, as it does not take into account the amortization of the premiums or discounts at which the bonds are trading.

It was one of the opening battles of the Invasion of Poland and World War II in general. It was fought between the forces of the Polish Modlin Army under General Krukowicz-Przedrzymirski and the German 3rd Army under General Georg von Küchler.\n\nAs a result of the Treaty of Versailles, the new German-Polish border was located only some 120 km north of Warsaw, the Polish capital city. In 1939 the Polish Modlin Army, led by Brigadier General Emil Krukowicz-Przedrzymirski, was thought of as the main defensive force guarding Polish borders from the north. It was located along the border with East Prussia and was to stop the enemy forces advancing towards Warsaw, the Modlin Fortress. Shortly before the war, a decision was made to strengthen the Polish defences by construction of a line of field fortifications and concrete bunkers to the north of Mława, in the centre of the army's positions.\n\nThe main line of defence of the army was located along the line of Narew and Vistula rivers. There were a number of 19th-century fortifications in the area, but the plains to the north of it were almost defenseless. To ease the delaying actions in case of a war with Germany, the Polish General Staff decided that the Modlin Army should be transported to the border with East Prussia and should defend the line for as long as possible. Afterwards, the units under command of General Przedrzymirski-Krukowicz were to withdraw to the south and defend the line of Narew and Vistula rivers, together with the forces of Narew Independent Operational Group.\n\nAfter the Polish secret mobilization had started in March 1939, the 20th Infantry Division was assigned to the Modlin Army and transported to the area of Mława. In addition, the army commander was assigned a number of trainloads of concrete and other construction materials and several combat engineering battalions. It was decided that a line of fortifications should be constructed in the area held by that division. On 19 June that year the project was ready and was finally approved by Marshal of Poland Edward Rydz-Śmigły on 3 July.\n\nThe line of trenches and concrete bunkers, shielded by anti-tank trenches and obstacles, was to be constructed along a low glacial hill overlooking the valley of the Mławka river, to the north of the town. The river itself could be blocked by a dam to enhance the defensive capability of the area. In the center, the swampy terrain of the Niemyje Marshes was located, which was virtually impassable to enemy armored vehicles. This swamp divided the area into two separate flanks. The western section was to be reinforced with 68 concrete bunkers while the eastern, much shorter, with 25.\n\nIn peacetime the 20th Division was located in Baranowicze. In case of a war with the USSR, it was planned as the first-line unit to defend a line of German World War I fortifications built there in 1915. Because of that, most of its soldiers had experience in defending fortified positions.\n\nThe construction of bunkers in the western section of the front, near the town of Mława, was started on 14 July. It was carried out mostly by the soldiers themselves, under the command of the head of the 20th engineering battalion, Maj. Juliusz Levittoux. The construction of the eastern flank bunkers near the village of Rzęgnowo started on 12 August. Soon the soldiers were joined by a number of civilian volunteers, helping to dig the trenches. However, the positions were not finished until the outbreak of World War II and many of the bunkers were not completed.\n\nAt noon on 1 September 1939 the Polish line of defence manned by the 20th Infantry Division was attacked by the 1st Army Corps under General Walter Petzel. Although the attacking forces were equipped with tanks and supported by warplanes, the initial assault was repelled by Polish-made 37mm \"Armata ppanc. wz. 36\" anti-tank guns. Georg von Küchler, the commander of German Third Army, ordered his units to attack the Polish forces several times in a row, but all attacks were broken and in the late evening the Germans were forced to withdraw to their initial positions.\n\nThe following afternoon the German units started heavy artillery bombardment of the Rzegnów position on the right flank of the Polish forces. After two hours of constant artillery fire, the assault was started and, in the result of close combat, the Polish defenders started to waver. The counterattack of the Polish 79th Infantry Regiment was unsuccessful and the commander of the Polish Modlin Army ordered the 20th Division to extend further eastwards and prepare the defence of its right flank between the villages of Dębsk and Nosarzewo. At the same time the 8th Infantry Division, until then held in reserve near Ciechanów, was ordered to prepare a counterattack.\n\nThe 8th Division arrived in the area in the early hours of 3 September. As the Mazovian Cavalry Brigade operating further eastwards was also endangered by German armoured troops, the army commander ordered the division to split its forces and attack in two directions: towards Grudusk east of Mława and towards Przasnysz. However, conflicting orders and German saboteurs operating in the rear disrupted both attacks and led to chaos in the Polish ranks. In the evening the division was mostly destroyed and only the 21st Infantry Regiment of Colonel (later General) Stanisław Sosabowski managed to withdraw from the fights towards the Modlin Fortress. Despite this, the German attacks towards both flanks of the 20th Infantry Division were unsuccessful.\n\nOn 3 September the German engineers finally managed to cut through Polish antitank barriers. The Germans used the local civilians as human shields, which allowed them to finally capture several bunkers on the left flank of the Polish forces, but were unable to push forwards. On the right flank, in the Rzegnów section of the front to the east of the swamps, the attacks were more successful and in the late evening elements of German Wodrig Corps finally broke through the lines of the 79th Infantry Regiment to the rear of the Poles. This widened the front gap in the area of Grudusk.\n\nGeneral Emil Krukowicz-Przedrzymirski, facing the risk of his forces being outflanked and surrounded, ordered the 20th division and the remnants of the 8th to withdraw towards Warsaw and Modlin, finally abandoning the fortified positions.\n\nThe withdrawal was started in the early morning of 4 September. Although the German mechanized units suffered heavy losses and were unable to maintain pursuit, the area to the south of Mława was very lightly forested and the Polish forces were constantly bombarded and strafed by the German Luftwaffe, suffering heavy losses both in troops and equipment.\n\nAlthough the position was abandoned, the German forces suffered substantial losses and it was not until 13 September that they finally managed to reach the Modlin Fortress, located less than 100 kilometres to the south.\n\n"}

Construction started in 1856 at the suggestion of Queen Victoria but its design caused some controversy, chiefly from Florence Nightingale. Often visited by Queen Victoria, the hospital was extensively used during the First World War. It became the 28th US General Hospital during the invasion of mainland Europe in the Second World War. The main building – the world's longest building when it was completed – was entirely demolished in 1966, except for the chapel and former YMCA building which still survive. The extensive outbuildings, which once occupied a vast acreage of land to the rear of the main building, finally succumbed in 1978. The site of the hospital can be seen and explored in Royal Victoria Country Park.\n\nThe hospital was situated within the larger area of land bounded by the River Itchen and River Hamble, particularly around Sholing that had become known locally as Spike Island. That term was subsequently used by wounded soldiers and prisoners of war to describe the location of the hospital.\n\nDuring the Crimean War (1854–1856), news of dreadful conditions in military hospitals in the Crimea caused political concern in England, and contributed to the fall of the government in 1855 due to \"Mismanagement of the War\". Encouraged by Queen Victoria and aided by the friendship between Florence Nightingale and the new Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston, the fresh political climate allowed a large military hospital to be planned and constructed.\n\nNetley on the shore of Southampton Water was first suggested as a site for the new hospital by Sir Andrew Smith, and was settled on after the rejection of co-location with the Naval Hospital at Haslar. The board in charge of the project was appointed by Lord Panmure and chaired by Colonel T. O'Brien, the Deputy Quartermaster General, and was to keep closely in touch with Smith to ensure that the views of medical officers on the design were respected. of land was purchased from Thomas Chamberlayne's Netley Grange Estate on 3 January 1856. Later that year, developing plans meant that further land was required, which was compulsorily purchased from Chamberlayne. Queen Victoria laid the foundation stone on 19 May 1856, concealing underneath a copy of the plans, the first Victoria Cross, a Crimea Medal and coins of the realm. The inscription read:\n\nThis stone was laid on the 19th day of May in the year of our Lord 1856, by Her Most Gracious Majesty Victoria, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland as the foundation stone of the Victoria Military Hospital intended for the reception of the sick and invalid soldiers of her Army\nSome confusion was caused by the publication in \"The Builder\" of unrevised plans for the hospital. Moreover, the influential Florence Nightingale, still busy in the Crimea, was not involved in the initial design. On her return she was able to highlight flaws in the design and politicise them. In January 1857, Prime Minister Lord Palmerston wrote:\nIt seems to me that at Netley all consideration of what would best tend to the comfort and recovery of the patients has been sacrificed to the vanity of the architect, whose sole object has been to make a building which should cut a dash when looked at from Southampton River. Pray stop all work.\nBut construction was well under way, and it was too late to change the design significantly. Subsequent reports and enquiries concluded that the design and its location were indeed flawed, though, under the influence of Dr John Sutherland, Nightingale eventually expressed approval for the plans.\n\nThe hospital eventually opened for patients on 11 March 1863. It was a quarter of a mile (435 m) long, had 138 wards and approximately 1,000 beds, and was Britain's largest military hospital. It cost £350,000 to build, and was late and over budget. Supporting infrastructure was also built, including a reservoir at Hound Grove and a gasworks A cast iron pier was extended into Southampton Water in 1865, restricted to in length and not reaching deep water. A railway line connected Netley to Southampton Docks on 5 March 1866. At the suggestion of Queen Victoria, the line was extended into the grounds of the hospital on 18 April 1900. In 1903, an electricity generating station was built.\n\nIn 1864 a Portland stone memorial was erected, dedicated to the members of the Army Medical Department who died in the Crimean War.\n\nThe building was enormous, grand, and visually attractive, but was neither convenient nor practical. Corridors were on the sea-facing front of the building, leaving the wards facing the inner courtyard with little light and air. Ventilation in general was poor, with unpleasant smells lingering around the vast building. In 1867, journalist Matthew Wallingford paid a visit to the hospital to write a report for the local parish newsletter:\n\nIt was a ghastly display of deception to say the least. To the naked eye it is a triumph of modern architecture, but should you inherit the misfortune to be sectioned there, one would not think of the place as so. It is not so much as the greatest military hospital in the world as much as it is a rather impractical waste of government finance.\n\nEarly patients arriving from campaigns taking place all over the world during the expansion of the British Empire had an uncomfortable journey to the hospital, either having to be transferred to a shallow-draft boat if landing at the pier, or transported from Netley station to the hospital if arriving by rail.\n\nThe hospital was particularly busy during the Second Boer War (1899–1902) which, when the project was further encouraged by Queen Victoria, provided the impetus for extending the railway line. The extension terminated at a station behind the hospital but was awkward to operate, having gradients which were steep for the locomotives of the time. Some trains needed a locomotive at each end to travel that ¾ of a mile.\n\nThe railway and pier were also used for Queen Victoria's frequent visits to the hospital; she often arrived at the pier having been conveyed in the Royal Yacht from her residence on the Isle of Wight, Osborne House. She awarded three Victoria Crosses to patients at the hospital.\n\nFrom its construction until 1902, Netley Hospital served as the home of the Army Medical School, training civilian doctors for service with the army. In \"A Study in Scarlet\", Dr. Watson recounts his earlier life before meeting Sherlock Holmes; it is established that Watson received his medical degree from the University of London in 1878, and had gone on to train at Netley Hospital as a surgeon in the Army. As many patients were suffering from tropical diseases, the hospital was also used for medical research. The first thing that confronted anyone entering the imposing central tower block was a large museum of natural history and anatomical specimens, reflecting the interests of many of the doctors.\n\nDuring the First World War, a large Red Cross hutted hospital was built at the rear of the site, which expanded Netley Hospital to accommodate around 2,500 beds. Many of the staff were Red Cross volunteers, as most of the regular staff were overseas. Some 50,000 patients were treated at Netley during the war.\n\nSimilar usage was seen during the Second World War, when around 68,000 casualties were treated. In June 1940, French soldiers from Dunkirk were treated here. In 1944, US Forces took over the hospital prior to D-Day.\n\nAfter the war, the hospital continued to care for some casualties returning from overseas service. It also accommodated some Hungarian refugees in 1956, but due to its high cost of maintenance, it gradually fell into disuse, and the main site closed in 1958.\n\nIn 1963, a large fire damaged much of the building, and it was demolished in 1966, with only the chapel retained. Shortly before its demolition, Jonathan Miller filmed his 1966 version of \"Alice in Wonderland\" in the hospital. A ceremony uncovered Queen Victoria's time capsule beneath the foundation stone on 7 December 1966.\n\nAt the rear of the site, D Block (Victoria House) and E Block (Albert House) formed the psychiatric hospital. D Block was opened in 1870 as the army's first purpose-built military asylum. These buildings were also used from the 1950s to 1978 to treat Army (and from 1960, Navy) personnel who suffered from sexually transmitted diseases, drug and alcohol problems, and later the Joint Armed Services Psychiatric Unit. The unit moved to the Queen Elizabeth Military Hospital, Woolwich in mid-1978.\n\nThe site is now open to the public as the Royal Victoria Country Park. Of the main building, only the hospital chapel remains; it was scheduled for demolition but was saved at the last moment as a monument to the hospital. The chapel was designated as Grade II* listed in 1974.\n\nSome buildings at the rear of the site, including the former asylum, are used as the Hampshire Constabulary Police Training Headquarters. The Officers' Mess survives and is also a listed building.\n\n\n\n"}

His musical career started at the age of 16 when he appeared on the Paul Whiteman television show in 1952.\nGracie performed at weddings, local restaurants, and parties, and on local radio and television. He also won regional talent contests. Charlie graduated from South Philadelphia High School in 1952.\n\nThe owner of Cadillac Records, Graham Prince, heard one of Gracie's early radio performances, contacted the young musician and signed him to a recording contract. This association yielded the single \"Boogie Woogie Blues\" backed with \"I'm Gonna Sit Right Down And Write Myself A Letter\". The record led to Charlie's first appearance on Bob Horn's \"American Bandstand\" television program, four years before Dick Clark became the host. After cutting two more singles for Cadillac, including one called \"Rockin' 'n' Rollin'\" in 1952, Charlie moved on to 20th Century Records, where he put out another four sides. The discs he made embraced a wide variety of styles: jump blues, gospel, and country boogie with the influences of Big Joe Turner, B.B. King, Louis Jordan, Roy Acuff, and Hank Williams.\n\nBy 1956, Philadelphia had given birth to the new Cameo record label. Its founders, in search of a strong talent, signed Gracie later that year. With a $600 budget, this new union went into the recording studio to record \"Butterfly\" backed with \"Ninety Nine Ways\". It became a hit record, reaching #1 in jukebox plays in the \"Billboard\" chart. Gracie received a gold disc for the two million plus sales. His only other Top 40 hit was with a song entitled \"Fabulous\" the same year, which reached number 16. This track also reached number 6 in the UK. Two other substantial sellers followed: \"Wandering Eyes\", his third Billboard Top 100 hit, which peaked at number 71 (another number 6 in the UK), and \"Cool Baby\" (also a top 30 hit in Britain). The financial success of these hits bankrolled the Cameo label, which became a dominant force in the music industry for several years.\n\nGracie's personal appearances grew until he performed and headlined some of the biggest venues of that time: Alan Freed's rock and roll shows at the Brooklyn Paramount, \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", \"American Bandstand\" and the 500 Club in Atlantic City, New Jersey. He appeared in the 1957 film \"Jamboree\" and toured with Chuck Berry, the Everly Brothers, Bo Diddley and his close friend Eddie Cochran.\n\nGracie became only the second American rock and roller to bring this new art form to the British concert stage. His two extensive tours in 1957 and 1958 were topped off by headlining the Palladium and the Hippodrome in London. In the audiences, among Gracie's fans, were future rock musicians Graham Nash, and members of the Beatles. These performers and many other well-known acts have credited Gracie as an influence. George Harrison referred to Gracie's guitar technique as 'brilliant' in a March 1996 interview with \"Billboard\"; Paul McCartney invited Gracie to the premiere party of his 1999 release which paid tribute to the early pioneers of rock music.\n\nAccording to the documentary film \"Wages of Spin\", Gracie sued Cameo Records for unpaid royalties and in retaliation was blacklisted from the radio and \"American Bandstand\". Per the film, \"Bandstand\" host Dick Clark had a relationship with the record company and was paid $14,000 for services related to Gracie's song \"Butterfly\".\n\nAfter Cameo, Gracie moved on to other record labels such as Coral, Roulette, Felsted, and Diamond, performing more of the R&B he preferred. Even as success slowed, he continued to perform in clubs, theaters, and resorts, from the 1960s through the 1990s. He still enjoys a loyal following in the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, and the Netherlands.\n\nDuring the late 1990s, he was introduced to Quentin Jones, a guitarist, studio owner and label head. Jones had a strong background in roots music, having played in a rockabilly band produced by the Stray Cats bassist Lee Rocker. He also played lead guitar on Robert Gordon's 1996 self-titled CD. Gracie and Jones met at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. They decided to record an album together with Jones acting as producer. He brought in bandmate Dave Ferrara to play drums. Jones played bass guitar, combining with Gracie's guitar and vocals. Gracie invited Jones and Ferrara to back him when Van Morrison commissioned Gracie to open his 2000 West Coast tour.\n\nContributing their musical talents on his latest CD were Tommy Conwell, whose guitar playing is featured on \"Still 19\", Ralph Miller on piano, Daryl Jenkins on saxophone, and Pete Barnhart on percussion. Graham Nash contributed vocals to the song \"A little Too Soon To Tell\".\n\nGracie's pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and is inducted into the South Philadelphia High School Alumni Cultural Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2007, a documentary film about Gracie, \"Fabulous\", was aired on PBS stations.\n\nIn 2011, ABKCO released the CD \"For The Love of Charlie\" produced by Al Kooper and co produced by Quentin Jones, with guest artists Graham Nash, Peter Noone, Jimmy Vivino, Craig Ross, and Dennis Diken, with Gracie singing some of his own songs and some covers.\n\nOn Gracie's 75th Birthday, he recorded \"Baby Doll\" with the hill & hifi. Released in the fall of 2011, it was his first single in over 50 years to receive UK airplay on the BBC. In the US, the record entered the Top 100 on Mediabase's Top 40 Chart, from the strength of Airplay at Sirius XM. Richie Scarlet is featured on lead guitar and played with Gracie at the Bitter End, in NYC, on March 30, 2012 after a Live Radio broadcast at WFUV. WXPK & WXPN played \"Baby Doll,\" as well, in regular rotation. The World Café featured Charlie Gracie, at their Philadelphia Venue, during the same time period, in support of the record.\n\nGracie was inducted into the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia Hall of Fame on November 16, 2012, at the Hilton City Avenue, Philadelphia.\n\nIn 2019, Gracie toured the UK with Marty Wilde along with Mike Berry, Nancy Ann Lee and the Wildcats.\n\nGracie is a devoted family man, married 60 plus years to his first and only wife, Joan. They have two children, a son and a daughter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1959551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1959551", "title": "Occipital neuralgia", "text": "Occipital neuralgia\n\nOccipital neuralgia is a medical condition characterized by chronic pain in the upper neck, back of the head and behind the eyes. These areas correspond to the locations of the lesser and greater occipital nerves. Wrapped around the greater occipital nerve is the occipital artery, which can contribute to the neuralgia. The condition is also sometimes characterized by diminished sensation in the affected area.\n\nThe main symptom of occipital neuralgia is chronic headache. The pain is commonly localized in the back and around or over the top of the head, sometimes up to the eyebrow or behind the eye. Because chronic headaches are a common symptom of numerous conditions, occipital neuralgia is often misdiagnosed at first, most commonly as tension headaches or migraines, leading to unsuccessful treatment attempts. Another symptom is sensitivity to light, especially when headaches occur.\n\nOccipital neuralgia is characterized by severe pain that begins in the upper neck and back of the head. This pain is typically one-sided, although it can be on both sides if both occipital nerves have been affected. Additionally, the pain may radiate forward toward the eye as it follows the path of the occipital nerve(s). Individuals may notice blurred vision as the pain radiates near or behind the eye. The pain is commonly described as sharp, shooting, zapping, an electric shock, or stabbing. The bouts of pain are rarely consistent, but can occur frequently depending on the damage to the nerves. The amount of time the pain lasts typically varies each time the symptom appears; it may last a few seconds or be almost continuous. Occipital neuralgia can last for hours or for several days.\n\nOther symptoms of occipital neuralgia may include: \n\n\nOccipital neuralgia is caused by damage to the occipital nerves, which can arise from trauma (usually concussive or cervical), physical stress on the nerve, repetitive neck contraction, flexion or extension, and/or as a result of medical complications (such as osteochondroma, a benign bone tumour). A rare cause is a cerebrospinal fluid leak. Another is radio frequency nerve ablation. Rarely, occipital neuralgia may be a symptom of metastasis of certain cancers to the spine. Among other cranial neuropathies, occipital neuralgia is also known to occur in patients with multiple sclerosis. Hodgkins and other cancer survivors who have had radiation treatment to the neck also can develop this, sometimes many years later. \n\nThere are several areas that have the potential to cause injury from compression:\n\n\nThe diagnosis is established clinically through characteristic symptoms (mostly short attacks of an intense sharp, piercing or electrifying pain with propagation along the occipital nerve from the lateral neck and under/behind the ear towards the side of the head and the eye, with often longer lasting background pain) and sometimes supporting clinical features.\n\nThere are a wide range of non-invasive treatments, including manipulation, physical therapy, rest, heat, anti-inflammatory medication, antidepressants, anti-convulsants, opioid and non-opioid analgesics, ketamine infusion therapy, and migraine prophylaxis medication. Alternatives include local nerve block, peripheral nerve stimulation, steroids, rhizotomy, phenol injections, and occipital cryoneurolysis.\nLess commonly, surgical neurolysis or microdecompression are used to treat the condition when conservative measures fail.\n\nFrei R.
