The dengaku celebrated for rice planting was performed by villagers either at the New Year or during the planting season in early summer. It was only in the 14th century that these dances were brought to the cities and incorporated into Noh theater, notably by the playwright and actor Kan'ami. The instrument of dengaku is the sasara, a wooden percussive instrument clapper, though there are other instruments that can be used.\nIn the \"Eiga Monogatari\" there is a detailed description of the rice-planting dengaku. After being brought to the aristocrats, dengaku flourished till the end of the Heian period and became the main performing art of the Kamakura and part of the Muromachi period.\n\nBy the end of the Muromachi, dengaku was eclipsed by sarugaku. Today it barely survives as a folk performing art.\n\nDengaku was closely linked with the native Japanese religion of Shinto. Ritualistic elements of this was incorporated with Sarugaku to form Noh theatre.\n\nThe following is some different perspectives on dengaku that are paraphrased and summarized from three different peer-reviewed articles. All ideas and quotes in three sections below belong to the authors of the articles or to whomever they themselves quoted in their article.\n\nIn the late eleventh century, \"Kyoto\" experienced \"dengaku\" performances that attracted all classes of people, either as observers or as participants.  Some of these events ended peacefully with others in violence.  But all were characterized by parades of people dressed in colorful costumes while dancing and playing loud music.\n\n\"Dengaku\" started as the music and dancing that performed in conjunction with field labor called \"ta-asobi\".  This form of rural entertainment evolved during the \"Heian\" period in response to diverse social, economic, political, and cultural movements.  Two types of \"dengaku\" had developed by the latter half of the period.  The first was the entertainment that accompanied field labor, but with new elements: the increasingly dominant entertaining aspect and the growing interest shown by local nobles. The nobility desired to “dominate rural areas, to increase crops, and thereby to boost tax income from the countryside”.  The second originated in the \"Kyoto\"-area temples and shrines which started adding \"dengaku\" to their sacred rites and services on account of the entertainment's growing popularity and its ability to attract large audiences.\n\nWith the tenth-century urban growth of \"Kyoto\", \"dengaku\" slowly dissociated itself from both the agricultural and religious context.  From the end of the eleventh century and for two hundred years, \"dengaku\" was the most popular form of entertainment.  Its earliest mention appears in \"Nihon Kiryaku\" where a performance is recorded taking place at the \"Matsuo\" festival in \"Yamazaki\" in 998.  In 1023, the \"kampaku\" \"Fujiwara no Michinaga\" sought to entertain his daughter \"Shōshi\", who was the mother of Emperor \"Go-Ichijō\".  He ordered that rice-planting should be carried out so that the activity could be viewed from the pavilion of the palace where she was staying.  On that day, she looked down on the farmers as they worked the field and witnessed a \"dengaku\" performance.  This was a new element in that nobles were viewing the performances and enjoying the experience.  Throughout the eleventh century, nobility interest was evident in \"dengaku\" as a way of dominating rural culture or as pure entertainment.\n\nA new style developed and has been called \"fūryū\" \"dengaku\".  \"Fūryū\" is a generic term for the processions that developed during the second half of the \"Heian\" period when catastrophes repeatedly struck the city and its environs. Processions were organized to placate the deities, demons, and ghosts thought responsible: characterized by the colorful costumes worn by the performers and the loud music.\n\n\"Dengaku\" was adopted by some of the most powerful shrines in \"Kyoto\" and came to be regularly performed at the \"goryō-e\" (one of the capital's main festivals and meant to appease agitated spirits). The original \"dengaku\" of the rice fields continued to flourish in rural society and in fact still survives in many agricultural areas.\n\nThe fusion of the two types into a new form of entertainment originated with the developing relationship between the urban and rural societies of the time.  The \"goryō-e\" festival at the \"Gion\" Shrine played a major role in bringing about this fusion. The festival was a major gathering of \"Kyoto\" citizens and peasants from surrounding villages. These assemblies, motivated by fear and superstition, easily took on a political or social perspective in times of dissatisfaction, and became a rallying point for support of future political developments. As a result, \"dengaku\" obtained a significance far beyond its original ritual, religious, and artistic merits.\n\nThe end of the eleventh century was witness to the end of the \"kampaku\" (regency) system of government and the beginning of the \"insei\" form. The \"insei\" system pretty well started in 1086 with the Emperor \"Shirakawa\" taking local control following his abdication. The new type of government took advantage of the public interest in \"dengaku\" shown by the growing participation of the masses in religious, political, and cultural affairs.  With the Great Dengaku movement, the \"insei\" government strove to prove its independence of the \"kampaku\" system.  \"Dengaku\" was an effective means to obtain that goal.\n\nFolklorism is “folklore on display, mainly for purposes of tourism or cultural preservation”.  The presentation of Japan’s folk performing arts occur frequently \"out-of-context\" at a number of events for folk-culture and tourism where context is “taken to mean local Shinto or Buddhist festivals and ceremonials”.  These performing arts have been divided into categories by scholars that incorporate these contexts: those known as \"dengaku\" are typically part of the late-winter or early-spring festivals to guarantee a successful agricultural cycle.\n\nThornbury indicates that the study of folk performing arts began in the late 1920s and is “an important area of inquiry both in folklore research and in research on the performing arts in general”.  She noted that often the studies that came out of these two fields of research had little to do with each other or the realities of the folk performing arts as they currently exist.  One exception was the work of \"Yamaji Kōzō\" which identified seven patterns to describe how performances could be rooted in communities.  The seven patterns identify a historic basis for understanding the relationship between folk performing arts and associated regions: showing the significance of the folk performing arts in the cultural history of Japan.  \"Yamaji\" directly mentions \"dengaku\" in the second and third patterns.\n\n\"Yamaji\"'s second pattern, covering the late twelfth to late sixteenth centuries, when provincial manors were established by the nobles and by powerful religious complexes that introduced festivals like those held in Kyoto to honor their deities.  Some performers were sent from the capital but most developed locally.  \"Yamaji\" refers to this period’s processions with their displays of performing arts such as “\"dengaku odori\" (\"dengaku\" dances)”.  The \"Kasuga Wakamiya Onmatsuri\", which began in 1136, is one of the best documented of Japan's folk performing arts events and is an example of this pattern.\n\nDating from the same time period as the second pattern, the third focuses on those performing arts that were incorporated into the ceremonials of Buddhist temples established by local clans.  \"Ennen\" is the blanket term for such performing arts such as \"dengaku odori\".  Performers with professional experience in these particular performing arts were hired to teach the priests and youths-in-training at the temples.  A current example of this pattern is \"Motsuji Ennen\" (Iwate Prefecture).\n\nWhile \"Yamaji\"'s analysis cannot account for every form of folk performing art, the evidence for a large portion is insufficient for certainty but it does dismiss the notion that folk performing arts are originally local creations. This is not to say that every folk performing art was born in a cultural capital: \"ta-asobi\" is one exception that is frequently mentioned.\n\n\"Shuten Dōji\" or Drunken Demon is “one of the most famous and popular \"oni\" legends in medieval Japanese literature”.  According to the legend, \"Shuten Dōji\" (overlord of the \"oni\") and his followers were “abducting and devouring young Kyoto maidens” and warriors were sent by the imperial court to destroy them. The warriors, helped by attending deities, carried out this mission: rescuing the survivors and restoring peace to the land.  Carnivalesque literature “inverts power structures, demystifying and lampooning that which a particular culture holds serious or sacred”.  At one point in the legend, a group of \"oni\" disguised as a \"dengaku\" (field music) troupe emerge to entertain the warriors.  A fierce stare wards them off.\n\nThe general meaning of \"dengaku\" “refers to all rituals related to agriculture and thus to fertility and regeneration”.  It could be simply described as a form of dance in which some people play musical instruments while dancing in various combinations.  In the \"Ōeyama ekotoba\" scroll, two warriors visit a shrine to pray for protection and are entertained by \"dengaku\".  In the scene at villain’s palace, the \"oni\" also perform \"dengaku\". The locations of the performances are similar. The angles of the buildings are the same.  The postures and costumes are identical.  The \"oni\"’s \"dengaku\" lampoons the earlier and more wholesome dance at the shrine: the shrine performance is for the warriors’ prayers to succeed in their mission whereas the \"oni\" \"dengaku\" seeks to trick the warriors so to facilitate killing them.\n\n\"Dengaku\" is described as being welcomed by all classes for its fund-raising capacity. A monk organized a \"dengaku\" competition to raise funds for the building of a bridge.  Those in attendance for the performance ranged from members of the imperial court down to commoners. All in attendance were fascinated by the \"dengaku\" until the collapse of the reviewing stand claimed the lives of people of all backgrounds.  This contrast between a fertility ritual and the deaths of innocent people is important to this carnivalesque event: it represents both destruction and renewal.\n\nThe growth of the performing arts was considered by part of Japanese society to be a bad omen: “the sudden appearance of \"oni\" as a dengaku troupe in the story can be seen as a harbinger of \"Shuten Dōji\"’s doom”.  It could be said that this carnivalesque ritual leads to the demise of \"Shuten Dōji\".  The defeat of \"Shuten Dōji\" brings a time of peace in Japan with renewed imperial authority and additional recognition of the warrior class.  From a carnivalesque point of view, the dance is both a dance of death and rebirth.\n\nThe “\"Nachi\" Fire Festival\" which is said to be one of Japan’s three largest fire festivals.  It is a part of the \"Kumano Nachi-taisha\" Shrine’s annual festival and is officially called “\"Ogi Matsuri\"” or Fan Festival.  This festival, held annually on July 14, is dedicated to the god in the precincts of \"Nachi-taisha\" Shrine.\n\nThe company ACT.JT performed on the terrace of Casa de Vacas (in Madrid, Spain) this dance with the participation of ten Spanish volunteers in a cultural exchange.  This event was performed within the framework of the Spain-Japan Dual Year events.\n\n"}

{"id": "2315586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2315586", "title": "Kusemai", "text": "Kusemai\n\nKusemai (曲舞, くせまい)　is a dance-like art form originating from medieval Japan (roughly, the Kamakura and Muromachi Periods). It was particularly popular during Japan’s Nanboku Period (CE1336-1392) up through the end of the rest of the Muromachi Period (CE 1336-1573). Kusemai is sometimes simply characterized as a Japanese form of song and dance with a strong irregular beat - emphasis is placed on the beat at the expense of the melody. \n\nKusemai is sometimes referred to in classical and medieval Japanese simply as \"mai\" (舞), or “dance.” While the modern Japanese kanji spelling of kusemai is 曲舞, written variants of the \"kanji\" are found in written records as 久世 舞 (kuse-mai) and 九世 舞 (kuse-mai). The “dance,” or pre-arranged physical movements of kusemai, are widely held to be the root of \"kōwakamai\"’s dance-element.\n\nThe type of music that accompanies the kusemai performance particularly flourished around Kyoto and Nara, in the 14th and 15th centuries. The name can be roughly translated as \"peculiar/unconventional dance.\" Although dance was originally involved with the performance, it was of minor importance, and probably involved the performer simply stamping the beat.\n\nKusemai’s origins are unknown but it appears to have started in the late 15th to early 16th centuries. A Muromachi Period illustration titled \"Shichijuuichi-ban shokunin utaawase\" (七十一番職人歌合) depicts a kusemai performer in contrast to another \"shirabyōshi\" (白拍子) performer. Since the garments and musical accompaniment of both kusemai and shirabyōshi, which came about at the end of the Heian Period, are so similar some scholars believe that shirabyōshi is the root of kusemai.\n\nA kusemai performance consists of a story/narrative tale and rhythmic musical accompaniment. The performer recites the narrative lines while dancing to the music [performed by separate musicians]. The dancer was either a man or a young boy (\"chigo\", 稚児).\n\nThe young boy-dancer costume consisted of \"suikan\" (水干, Heian period-style garments), \"ōguchi\" (大口, a long, loose fitted, pleated skirt), and tall style \"eboshi\" cap. Adult male dancers wore warrior-class garments called \"hitatare\" (直垂) in place of suikan. Dancers also held a folding fan which served as a basic performance prop.\n\nThere are also performances called \"onna no kusemai\" (女曲舞) or \"jokyokumai\" (女曲舞) in which women wear the male performer’s clothes and perform kusemai.\n\nThe kusemai “Yamauba” and “Hyakuman” are said to be the oldest performances of kusemai, having been transmitted from time immemorial to the present. Also, kōwakamai, which is sometimes considered a style of kusemai, is known to have been created sometime in the Muromachi Period and has been passed down to the present day.\n\nEncyclopædia Britannica 2005 \"Ultimate Reference Suite\" DVD, article- \"Kan'ami\"\n\n\"The Structure of Kusemai\" [Qu] [wu] P.

Severus' victory finally established him as the sole emperor of the Roman Empire.\n\nThis battle is said to be the largest, most hard-fought, and bloodiest of all clashes between Roman forces. \nThe historian Cassius Dio places the number involved as 300,000, or 150,000 on either side of the battle. This figure has been disputed, as this is approximately three-quarters of the total number of soldiers present throughout the Roman Empire at that time. However, it is widely accepted that the total number of soldiers and support personnel involved exceeded 100,000, and could well have come close to half the 300,000 figure Dio gives.\n\nAfter the murder of Emperor Pertinax (193), a struggle began for the succession to the throne, the so-called Year of the Five Emperors. The new self-proclaimed Emperor in Rome, Didius Julianus, had to face the commander of the Pannonian legions, Septimius Severus. Before moving on Rome, Severus made an alliance with the powerful commander of the legions in Britannia, Clodius Albinus, recognizing him as Caesar. After eliminating Didius (193) and then defeating the governor of Syria, Pescennius Niger (194), Severus launched a successful campaign in the East in 195. Severus then tried to legitimize his power, connecting himself with Marcus Aurelius, and raising his own son to the rank of Caesar. This last act broke Severus' alliance with Albinus, who was declared a public enemy by the Senate.\n\nIn 196, after being hailed as emperor by his troops, Clodius Albinus took 40,000 men in three legions from Britannia to Gaul. After gathering up additional forces, he set up headquarters at Lugdunum. He was joined there by Lucius Novius Rufus, the governor of Hispania Tarraconensis, and by the Legio VII \"Gemina\" under his command. But Severus had the powerful Danubian and German legions on his side. To try to minimise this advantage and possibly win their support, Albinus struck first against the German forces under Virius Lupus. He defeated them, but not decisively enough to challenge their allegiance to Severus. Albinus then considered invading Italy, but Severus had prepared for this by reinforcing the garrisons of the Alpine passes. Not wishing to risk the losses or the delay that forcing the passes would cause, Albinus was deterred.\n\nIn the winter of 196–197, Severus gathered his forces along the Danube and marched into Gaul, where, much to his surprise, he found that Albinus' forces were about the same strength as his own. The two armies first clashed at \"Tinurtium\" (Tournus), where Severus had the better day but was unable to obtain the decisive victory he needed.\n\nAlbinus' army fell back to Lugdunum; Severus followed, and on 19 February 197, the massive and ultimately decisive battle finally commenced. The exact details are as vague as the exact numbers involved. However, we do know both sides were roughly evenly matched and it was therefore a bloody and drawn-out affair lasting over two days (it was rare for battles of this time to last longer than a few hours). The tide shifted many times during the course of the battle, with the outcome hanging in the balance. It seems Severus had the edge in cavalry, which swung the battle in his favour for the final time. Exhausted and bloodied, Albinus' army was crushed.\n\nThe exact cause of Albinus' death is unclear. He fled into Lugdunum where he either, in the Roman tradition, \"ran upon his sword\" after finding all escape routes cut, or he was finished off by an assassin's blade. Severus had Albinus' body stripped and beheaded. He rode over the headless corpse with his horse in front of his victorious troops. The head he sent back to Rome as a warning along with the heads of Albinus' family. In Lugdunum itself, Septimius remodeled the Imperial cult sanctuary to celebrate his dominance and humiliate Albinus' provincial supporters. According to Duncan Fishwick, the reformed Imperial rites at Lugdunum resembled those due a master from his slaves. At some point after this battle, the unified Roman province of Britain was broken up into Upper and Lower halves ( & \"\"). Roman forces in Britannia were also severely weakened, which would lead to incursions, uprisings, and a withdrawal of Rome from the Antonine Wall south to Hadrian's Wall. It was while quelling one of these uprisings that Severus himself would die near Eboracum on 4 February 211, only weeks short of the 14th anniversary of his victory at Lugdunum.\n\n"}

Despite being nominated as Holy Roman Emperor after Ferdinand's death in 1657, he stood aside in favour of his nephew Leopold I.\n\nHis main interest was in art, and he patronised artists including David Teniers the Younger, Frans Snyders, Peter Snayers, Daniel Seghers, Peter Franchoys, Frans Wouters, Jan van den Hoecke and Pieter Thijs. His collection of 17th century Venetian and Dutch paintings are now held by the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.\n\nBorn at Wiener Neustadt on 5 January, 1614, he was the sixth of seven children born to Emperor Ferdinand II (1578-1637) and his first wife, Maria Anna of Bavaria (1574–1616). His elder brother became Emperor Ferdinand III (1608–1657). \n\nAs a younger son, Leopold was educated for the church, although he was never formally a member of the clergy. To provide him an income, he held various Prince-Bishoprics within the Holy Roman Empire, despite not being a member of the clergy. They included Halberstadt (1628–1648), Passau (1625–1662), Breslau (1656–1662), Olmütz (1637–1662) and Strasbourg (1626–1662). \n\nHe was also appointed to the Bishopric of Halberstadt in 1627, Magdeburg in 1629 and Bremen in 1635. All three were in the Protestant north, where the infrastructure of the Catholic church had long since disappeared; he never exercised power and all three were secularised in 1648.\n\nDuring his lifetime, the Habsburg rulers of Spain and the Holy Roman Empire faced the 1568 to 1648 Dutch Revolt, the 1618 to 1648 Thirty Years War and other conflicts, including the Franco-Spanish War (1635–1659). Despite his reluctance, Ferdinand made him Imperial commander in 1639, largely due to lack of reliable subordinates; he resigned following a disastrous defeat at Second Breitenfeld in 1642, a battle fought against the advice of his generals. \n\nHe was re-appointed after another Imperial defeat at the 1645 Battle of Jankau, then Governor of the Spanish Netherlands in 1647. In that role, he helped negotiate an end to the war in the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia; the Franco-Spanish war continued, obliging him to remain in Brussels until 1656. \n\nWhile in Brussels, he employed David Teniers the Younger as keeper of his collection, spending immense sums on works by Frans Snyders, Peter Snayers, Daniel Seghers, Peter Franchoys, Frans Wouters, Jan van den Hoecke, Pieter Thijs, Jan van de Venne and others. He also acquired a number of Italian masters, purchased from the sale of collections owned by Bartolomeo della Nave and Charles I.

On his return to Vienna in 1656, his collection relocated to the Hofburg Palace, where Jan Anton van der Baren, a Flemish priest and artist, served as director. The collection was bequeathed to his nephew Leopold I, and is now part of the collections of the \"Kunsthistorisches Museum\" in Vienna. \n\nHe played an active role in court politics and was close to his stepmother, Eleonora of Mantua (1598-1655), who shared his interest in Italian art and was a prominent supporter of the Catholic Counter-Reformation. Although suggested as a candidate to replace Ferdinand as Holy Roman Emperor in 1657, he ensured his nephew Leopold I was elected when he reached 18 in July 1658. \n\n\n"}

It has staged the Amateur Athletics Association Championships, and was the venue of the 1998 Disability World Athletics Championships. It hosted one England Monarchs game in 1998 with an attendance of 8,000. It frequently hosts the English Schools' Athletics Championships, alternating every few years with Gateshead. 2019 will be the last year the ESAA Championships will be held there due to its demolition and rebuild for the commonwealth games. It hosts the annual British Grand Prix and will be the main athletics venue of the 2022 Commonwealth Games.\n\nThe construction of the stadium began in 1975 and it opened in 1976. It is the home of Birchfield Harriers, one of the best known athletics clubs in the United Kingdom, replacing their former home at Alexander Sports Ground.\n\nIt has an eight-lane synthetic surface track with a ten lane straight. There are 7,000 covered seats in 3 separate stands called Main, Knowles (after Dick Knowles) and Nelson (after Doris Nelson Neal OBE) and a 5,000 seater main stand in the rear straight.\n\nThe stadium has held many music events, including a one-day festival called Party in the Park run by BRMB (now Free Radio Birmingham) radio that featured acts like Nelly Furtado, Westlife, Natasha Bedingfield, Blue, Sugababes, Girls Aloud and The Calling. The event was later moved to Cannon Hill Park where it was in a more central part of the city and so made it easier for people from south Birmingham to attend. This event, however, was later cancelled although it returned in 2010.\n\nOn 22 March 2016 transgender fell-runner Lauren Jeska attacked UK Athletics official Ralph Knibbs at the stadium, stabbing him multiple times. Jeska had feared her records and ability to compete in women's events would be investigated due to the unfair advantage she had from being born male. She later plead guilty to attempted murder and was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment.\n\nIn 2011 Alexander Stadium underwent a £12.5 million expansion and refurbishment, including the building of a 5,000 seater stand opposite the current main stand. This took the capacity to 12,700. The new stand has also become home to the offices of UK Athletics.\n\nThe stand was completed in June 2011, in time to host the Diamond League British Grand Prix in July 2011.\n\nIn June 2017, during the preparation of the Birmingham bid for the 2022 Commonwealth Games, the Birmingham bid committee proposed to renovate the Alexander Stadium and use it for hosting the athletics and ceremonies of the Games. But in August 2017, former UK Athletics (UKA) Chief Ed Warner proposed London Stadium in London to host the athletic events while Birmingham and West Midlands to host the rest of the sporting events of the Games. The London Stadium hosted the athletics and the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics as well as the 2017 World Athletic Championships and Para Athletics Championships. Ed Warner claimed that enough funds could be saved by using the London Stadium rather than renovating the Alexander Stadium in Birmingham.\n\nOn 11 April 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May announced that £70 million (approx. USD $90 million) of investment will be earmarked to transform the Alexander Stadium into a world-class athletics venue for the 2022 Commonwealth Games.\n\nIn February 2019, Councillor Paul Tilsley claimed that the refurbished Alexander Stadium would become a white elephant after the Games as no long-term tenant for the stadium was identified. He was also concerned about the funding arrangement of the Games and claimed that spending funds in organizing the Games could put the council into very heavy debt.\n\nIn October 2018, British engineering and designing firm Arup was chosen by the Birmingham City Council to redesign the stadium. British construction firm Mace was chosen to manage the stadium renovation project.\n\nOn 21 June 2019, the Birmingham City Council released the images and plans for renovating the Alexander Stadium and claimed that it would create a legacy asset for the Perry Barr area. The council claimed that the stadium could become the permanent home for the UKA and host major athletics events such as the Diamond League meeting which is currently held at the London Stadium. But former UKA chief Ed Warner claimed that moving the main athletic events from London to Birmingham would be unattractive for the UKA both financially and in terms of the sport's profile. A UKA spokesperson also told the Press Association Sport that the UKA had no plans to take athletics events out of London Stadium.\n\nOn 30 January 2020, the Birmingham City Council's planning committee approved the renovation plans of the Alexander Stadium which would cost £72 million.\n\nIn March 2020, the Birmingham City Council chose the Northern Irish firm McLaughlin & Harvey to redevelop the stadium.\n\n"}

A working title considered for the album was \"Fruit Fallen From God's Garden\".\n\nIt spawned three UK singles; \"Great Fire\", \"Wonderland\" and \"Love on a Farmboy's Wages\" (reached No. 50 on the UK singles chart). This was the final album that drummer Terry Chambers appeared on with XTC, as he quit the group during the recording sessions, frustrated with the band's decision to becoming a solely studio-based act. He was replaced by Peter Phipps. Andy Partridge later said \"Until early 1982, our work was like black-and-white TV. \"Mummer\" was the first in full colour -- bright sky blue.\"\n\nThe album was delayed many months by Virgin Records. It was originally supposed to be released by Epic Records on 26 May 1983 in the U.S.A.

Yankovic gathered most of the information he needed to write the song from Internet spoilers. Although Lucasfilm declined a request for an advance screening, Yankovic eventually attended a costly pre-screening for charity. He had done such an accurate job with the story line that after the pre-screening, he ended up making only very minor alterations.\n\nMcLean approved of the song and, according to Yankovic, also has said that his children played it so much that \"he'd start thinking about Jedis and \"Star Wars\", and it would mess him up\" in concert. According to Yankovic's official website, Lucasfilm's official response to the song was, \"You should've seen the smile on (George Lucas') face.\" This is the second \"Star Wars\" song Weird Al has created, with the first being 1985's \"Yoda\", a parody of \"Lola\" by The Kinks.\n\nThe video begins in the desert on the planet Tatooine. Yankovic, dressed like Obi-Wan Kenobi, the protagonist of \"Episode I\", walks until he comes across Darth Sidious playing the piano. Yankovic uses the Force to get a resonator guitar, and in the second verse he reappears performing in a Mos Eisley cantina leading a band also dressed as Jedi. In the last verse, he returns to the desert; and in the last chorus, numerous \"Obi-Wan\" clones sing as a group.\n\nIn 2011, the entire video was released as a bonus feature in a \"Star Wars\" spoofs compilation for the 2011 Blu-ray box set release of the saga.\n\nThe song was played frequently on Radio Disney and later released on \"Radio Disney Jams Volume 2\". Radio Disney took issue with his line \"Did you see him hitting on the queen?\" and removed it (so that the song skipped slightly). Yankovic, who usually does not like to change lyrics to suit the needs of others, provided Radio Disney with an updated version, having changed the words to \"Did you see him talking to the queen?\" He said that the alternate lyrics were preferable to the bad edit.\n\n"}

It is the native language of the Moriori, the indigenous people of New Zealand's Chatham Islands (\"Rēkohu\" in Moriori), an archipelago located east of the South Island.\n\nThe Chatham Island's first European contact was with William R. Broughton of Great Britain who landed on 29 November 1791 and claimed the islands. He renamed his ship, HMS \"Chatham\". Broughton's crewmen intermarried with the women of Moriori.\n\nThe genocide of the Moriori people by Maori invaders occurred during the autumn of 1835. The invasions of the Chatham Islands left the Moriori people and their culture to die off. Those who survived were in some cases kept as slaves, and Moriori were not permitted to marry other Moriori or have children within their race. This caused their people and their language to be endangered. There were only 101 Moriori people left out of 2000 who had survived in 1863.\n\nThe invasion from Taranaki had a heavy impact on Moriori population, culture and language, with only 101 Moriori remaining in 1862, and few speaking the language by the 1870s. However, Samuel Deighton, Resident Magistrate on the Chathams from 1873 to 1891, compiled a short vocabulary of Moriori words, with their equivalents in Māori and English. The vocabulary was published as an appendix of Michael King's \"Moriori: A People Rediscovered\".\n\nThe language was reconstructed for Barry Barclay's 2000 film documentary \"The Feathers of Peace\", in a recreation of Moriori contact with Pākehā and Māori.\n\nIn 2001, as part of a cultural revival movement, Moriori people began attempts to revive the language, and compiled a database of Moriori words. There is a POLLEX (Polynesian Lexicon Project Online) database of Moriori words as well.\n\nThe 2006 New Zealand census showed 945 people choosing to include \"Moriori\" amongst their tribal affiliations, compared to 35 people in the 1901 census.\n\nThe word \"a\" in Moriori corresponds to \"e\" in Māori, \"ka\" for \"ki, eriki\" for \"ariki\" (lord, chief), \"reimata\" for \"roimata\" (tear), \"wihine\" for \"wahine\" (woman), and more. Sometimes a vowel is dropped before a consonant such as na (ena), ha (aha) and after a consonant like rangat (rangata), nawen (nawene), hok (hoki), or (oro), and mot (motu), thus leaving a closed syllable. A vowel is also sometimes dropped after a vowel in the case the preceding vowel is lengthened and sometimes before a vowel, where the remaining vowel is lengthened.\n\n"}

To restrict the too general middle term here, 'wet fuel' should be added as the condition of fire.\n\nIt can also be viewed as a disguise or vehicle for true reality, both defining something and limiting it.

It is an interchange between two main lines; the Cross Country Route and the Trent Valley section of the West Coast Main Line (WCML). It has four platforms: Two low-level platforms (1 and 2) on the WCML, and two high level platforms (3 and 4) served by the Cross Country Route. Historically there were chords connecting the two lines, but there is no longer any rail connection between them.\n\nThe original station was opened on 12 August 1839 by the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway on its original route from Derby to Hampton-in-Arden meeting the London and Birmingham Railway for London.\n\nOn 26 June 1847 the London and North Western Railway opened its Trent Valley Line passing beneath the original line with a new joint station designed by John William Livock.\n\nThe joint station did not acquire the \"High Level\" and \"Low Level\" names until 1924. Since it was expected that only local trains would call, the platforms were on loops, with the running lines left clear for expresses. At that time there was a north to west curve linking the, by then, Midland with the LNWR line. Since it was the crossing of two major lines – one Bristol to Newcastle, the other Euston to Aberdeen – it was important for the Royal Mail transferring upwards of 2,000 bags every night.\n\nA north to east curve was also built very early on by the Trent Valley Railway and the Birmingham & Derby Junction railway, and track was laid on it, but it is not known whether it was ever used. It was certainly lifted by the turn of the century. The track left the Trent Valley line and climbed on an embankment until it crossed the River Anker via a bridge, then entered a cutting until reaching the Midland line. The bridge, known locally as the Spider Bridge, was demolished sometime during the late 1960s by the Royal Engineers, and the cutting was filled in shortly afterwards, so there is little to see nowadays except for the vegetation-covered embankment leading to the bridge.\n\nPrior to the introduction of diesel engines, Tamworth Railway Station was particularly well known to 'train spotting' enthusiasts as the closest station to Birmingham at which the larger and faster steam engines could be seen on the London to the North West Coast Line. The south-east corner, where the lines crossed, was at that time a vacant field, and used to be filled with spotters who would bring refreshments and spend the whole day there. A housing estate now occupies that spot.\n\nThere was a large water tower and pumping station at the east end of the low level, pumping water from the River Anker below.\n\nThe original station was demolished in 1961 and a new station was designed by the architects for the London Midland Region of British Railways, Maurice Wheeler, E.G. Girdlestone and J.B. Sanders. The rebuilt station opened in 1962 and at the same time the Trent Valley Line was electrified, requiring the High level line and platforms to be raised by two feet.\n\n\nThere are four platforms:\n\nThe main buildings are adjacent to platform 1 and incorporate a ticket office (manned seven days per week – 06:10 to 20:00 Mondays to Saturdays and 09:45 – 16:15 Sundays), customer service enquiry counter, photo booth, toilets, post box and a coffee shop. Two self-service ticket machines are sited on the station frontage for use when the ticket office is closed. Platform 2 only has a waiting shelter, whilst both high level platforms have waiting rooms. Train running information is provided via automatic announcements, CIS displays and timetable poster boards.\n\nBoth low-level platforms are directly linked with both high-level platforms by staircases (4 in total). All platforms are fully accessible for disabled passengers, as the two levels are also linked by lifts (3 in total). There is, however, no direct lift between platforms 2 and 3; step-free access between these platforms is only via platforms 4 and 1.\n\nWest Midlands Trains operating under the \"London Northwestern\" branding, operates a regular Monday to Sunday semi-fast hourly service between London and Crewe via Stafford which calls at Tamworth.

He is from a Jewish family; his maternal grandparents were deported to Auschwitz. He studied cinema at the as well as at the University of Paris VIII. He was rejected on two occasions by the French film school IDHEC (Institut des hautes études cinématographiques), now known as La fémis. He later attended the film school at New York University from 1983 to 1985. During the 1980s, he started to shoot short films such as \"In transit\" or \"Ce qui me meut\". He subsequently worked as a scriptwriter and he became a director for feature films. He has also directed a nature documentary for French television.\n\nIn 1992, Klapisch shot his first feature film, \"Riens du tout\". A year later, a TV channel asked him to make a film about high school life, set in 1975, \"Le péril jeune\". The film had a very small budget and featured Romain Duris and Vincent Elbaz, who would become two of his favourite actors. Due to its success when broadcast on TV, the film was released in the theaters two years later. During the 1990s, Klapisch made three short films to encourage the use of condoms in combatting AIDS: \"La chambre\", \"Le Poisson Rouge\" and \"Le Ramoneur des Lilas\".\n\nIn 1996, Klapisch gained greater international recognition after he directed two divergent films, \"Chacun cherche son chat (When the Cat's Away)\", and an adaptation of the French theatre comedy \"Un air de famille\". Agnès Jaoui and Jean-Pierre Bacri, the two scriptwriters and main actors, asked him to adapt the play into a film. The film received César Awards for the script and for the female and male supporting roles, Catherine Frot and Jean-Pierre Daroussin. His next film, \"Peut-être (Maybe)\", from 1999, featured Jean-Paul Belmondo, Duris and Elbaz.\n\nKlapisch's next film, \"Ni pour, ni contre (bien au contraire)\", had its production delayed for 4 months. During this period, he devised a new, low-budget product, which became \"L'Auberge Espagnole\" (\"The Spanish Apartment\"). Shot in Spain, this film became his greatest box-office success, and he planned three parts to what became known as his \"Spanish Apartment Trilogy\". In 2005, he filmed a sequel to \"L'Auberge Espagnole\", \"Les Poupées Russes (Russian Dolls)\", with many of the same actors from \"L'Auberge Espagnole\". His film \"Paris\" was released in February 2008, and \"Ma part du gâteau\" in 2011. In 2012, Klapisch filmed \"Casse-tête chinois\" (\"Chinese Puzzle\"). This sequel to \"Les Poupées Russes\" was released in 2013.\n\n"}

It was founded as an independent airline in 1979. Air New Zealand took a 50% shareholding in 1988 and 100% ownership in 1995. Air Nelson operated services on provincial routes under the Air New Zealand Link brand.\n\nThe airline operated one type of aircraft, the 50-seat Bombardier Q300, which provided an intensive regional air service that cannot be sustained with regional jet types of this size. Until 2008, it operated the 33-seat Saab 340, which took over provincial Fokker F27 services by Air New Zealand in 1990.\n\nAir Nelson Q300s wore the Air New Zealand livery and operated from Kerikeri in the far north of the North Island to Invercargill in the far south of the South Island. The airline had 517 employees (at March 2015).\n\nOn 31 March 2019, it was announced that Air New Zealand was considering merging both Air Nelson and fellow Link subsidiary Mount Cook Airline into the mainline fleet.\n\nAir Nelson was established and started operations in 1979. It was founded by Robert Inglis and Nicki Smith, who later sold it to Air New Zealand.\n\nIt initially operated as a small commuter airline in the top half of the South Island, linking Nelson and Wellington with up to half-hourly services. It also provided isolated towns such as Takaka and Motueka with a convenient safe service to the outside world. At this time aircraft included Piper PA-31 Navajo, Fairchild Metro, and Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante.\n\nIn 1986, Air New Zealand announced it would start to scale back its Fokker F27 Friendship operations and smaller regional centres were the first affected. Air Nelson services immediately replaced the F27 on those routes. Air Nelson grew their network at the same time and started operating non-stop service to Auckland, complementing F27 services.\n\nAir New Zealand purchased a 50% stake in Air Nelson (and a 50% stake in Eagle Airways) in 1988 to secure the airline's support when deregulation saw the arrival of Ansett New Zealand.\n\nAir New Zealand suspended all F27 services in August 1990 and Air Nelson responded by introducing the Saab 340. Initially the Saab 340 wore Air Nelson colours, before all Air Nelson's fleet were repainted in Air New Zealand's 'Link' livery. The Saab fleet soon grew to one of the largest in the world at that time and Air Nelson divested itself of its smaller aircraft, operating only the Saab. This was in line with Air New Zealand's policy of rationalising the overall cost of fleet maintenance. Eagle Airways soon operated a fleet of Beechcraft 1900Ds, while Mount Cook Airlines operated the ATR 72-500.\n\nAir New Zealand took 100% ownership of Air Nelson in 1995.\n\nDuring October 2004 the airline announced that it was replacing its fleet of seventeen Saab 340As with seventeen Bombardier Dash 8 Q300 aircraft, with options for another ten Dash 8 Q300 and thirteen Dash 8 Q400 aircraft, although the latter aircraft options have since been dropped. The last Saab 340A aircraft had been withdrawn from service by the end of 2007. The company had 23 Dash 8 Q300 aircraft. Air Nelson was the largest singular operator of the Q300 outside Canada. Although Air Nelson looked towards ATR for the smaller ATR 42, Bombardier offered a better discount for a bulk purchase.\n\nThe increase in fleet size allowed Air New Zealand to start pioneering longer provincial routes that were considered sustainable with 50-seat aircraft, such as Wellington to Invercargill, New Plymouth and Tauranga to Christchurch. Air New Zealand has also used the Q300 to ramp up a more intensive high-frequency regional service allowing more departure choices. A new Paraparaumu to Auckland route was started in 2011. A second route from the Kapiti Coast was opened in 2013, Paraparaumu to Christchurch, but it could not be sustained and the short-lived service ceased in 2015.\n\nThe Hokitika–Christchurch route joined the Air Nelson network as a result of the Pike River coal mine disaster in November 2010 when Air New Zealand added capacity to the Westland town. This became permanent in February 2011 when subsidiary operator Air National was grounded by the NZCAA due to irregularities with operating practises. The larger aircraft proved popular on peak services to the West Coast airport, which also serves the town of Greymouth.\n\nIn November 2014, Air Nelson started to take over services from fellow subsidiary Eagle Airways after parent company Air New Zealand had announced the close-down of the airline by August 2016. Routes including Auckland–Taupo, Auckland–Whanganui, Hamilton – Palmerston North, Wellington–Gisborne, Wellington–Timaru, Wellington – Palmerston North and Christchurch–Blenheim joined the Air Nelson network as a result of Eagle Airways' closure.\nAir New Zealand immediately reviewed and closed down the Auckland–Hamilton, Auckland–Whanganui and Christchurch–Blenheim routes. Some routes were picked up by second-tier operators.\n\nIn 2018 Air New Zealand announced that the Auckland–Paraparaumu route was to close due to aircraft scheduling issues. After intense lobbying by local authorities, Air Chathams took over the route with a Saab 340 airliner in September 2018, with Air New Zealand leaving behind ground servicing equipment for the airline to use.\n\n the Q300 fleet is considered old in Air New Zealand's fleet-age policy.\nBombardier has sold its turboprop Q400 production facilities to Viking Aviation, choosing to focus on its Regional Jet family and Airbus Industries 220 twinjets. This has left Air Nelson with the only option of purchasing the ATR 42 or low-houred secondhand Q300 types. \nThe Q300 airliners operate a very intensive service on busy regional routes and supplement Mount Cook Airline's ATR fleet to larger city centres.\n\nThe transfer of heavy maintenance for Mount Cook Airline's ATR 72 fleet from Christchurch to Air Nelson's new facilities at Nelson Airport in 2013 has been seen as a prelude to further fleet rationalisation with the option of purchasing the ATR 42 as an option for Q300 replacement.\n\nOn 19 November 2019, the merger of Air Nelson took place, with their fleet moving to the Air New Zealand air operators certificate and the airline ceasing to operate, these aircraft are now also operating under the Air New Zealand callsigns (NZxxxx), furthermore removing the old RLK ICAO code.\n\nAir Nelson served the following routes at its closure:\n\n\nAir Nelson used to serve the towns of Kapiti Coast, Motueka, Oamaru, Takaka, Westport and Whanganui.\n\nThe Air Nelson fleet consisted of the following aircraft (as of August 2019):\nAircraft formerly in the fleet were:\n\n"}
{"id": "2315782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2315782", "title": "Mario Praz", "text": "Mario Praz\n\nMario Praz KBE (; September 6, 1896, Rome – March 23, 1982, Rome) was an Italian-born critic of art and literature, and a scholar of English literature. His best-known book, \"The Romantic Agony\" (1933), was a comprehensive survey of the decadent, erotic and morbid themes that characterized European authors of the late 18th and 19th centuries. See \"Femme fatale\" for a reference of one of his chapters. The book was written and published first in Italian as \"\" in 1930, and the most recent edition was published in Firenze: Sansoni, 1996.\n\nPraz was the son of Luciano Praz (died 1900), a bank clerk, and his wife, the former Giulia Testa di Marsciano (died 1931), daughter of Count Alcibiade Testa di Marsciano. His stepfather was Carlo Targioni (died 1954), a doctor, whom his mother married in 1912.\n\nHe studied at the University of Bologna (1914–15), received a law degree from the University of Rome (1918), and received a doctorate in literature from the University of Florence (1920).\n\nPraz married, on 17 March 1934 (separated 1942, divorced 1947), Vivyan Leonora Eyles (1909–1984), an English-literature lecturer at the University of Liverpool whom Praz met during his time there as a special lecturer in Italian studies. She was a daughter of the English novelist and feminist writer Margaret Leonora Eyles (1889–1960), who addressed to her in 1941 an autobiographical work entitled \"For My Enemy Daughter\". She married in 1948, as her second husband, art historian Wolfgang Fritz Volbach. Praz and Eyles had one child, a daughter, Lucia Praz (born 1938).\n\nPraz's only other known romantic attachment was to an Anglo-Italian woman named Perla Cacciguerra, whom he met in 1953 and called \"Diamante\" in the book \"The House of Life\".\n\nMario Praz' residence in Palazzo Primoli in Rome has been turned into the Museo Mario Praz.\n\nMario Praz was a well-respected Italian-born art critic and scholar of the English language. He taught Italian Studies at the Victoria University of Manchester between 1932 and 1934. He then went on to teach English Literature at the University of Rome from 1934, until he retired in 1966. In 1962, Praz was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II and became a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire KBE. Though Mario Praz is perhaps best known for his writings in the English literary field, he has made strong contributions to the concepts, writings and perception of both interior design and interior decoration. The concepts that were presented in his \"\"The Romantic Agony\"\" have been shaped into his design and art criticism. This writing style has been successfully administered in Praz’s two most noteworthy design books, \"\"The House of Life\"\" and \"\"An Illustrated history in Interior Design\"\". These works highlight his theories of the interiority of a space, and reveal his concepts to how a person inhabits the interior and how they shape it to make it their own. His ground-breaking work \"\"Studies in seventeenth-century imagery\"\", first published in 1939 and reissued many times since, is one of the first attempts to produce a systematic catalogue and analysis of the early modern allegorical genres of the emblem and the personal device.\n\nMario Praz has had a profound impact not only on writings about interior design and decoration but also on the history, and the development, of design. The work, \"An Illustrated History of Interior Decoration from Pompeii to Art Nouveau\" has allowed the creation of a photographic album to be made, \"Praz’s rediscovery of this minor but fascinating art . . . was a revelation, and the historic no less than aesthetic importance of the subject is now recognised by a group of informed collectors\". His work \"provides a selection of visual representations of domesticity from ancient Greece through to the Art Nouveau, and a commentary upon them.\" The images show the interior decor and design of Greek, Roman, Medieval, Renaissance and Victorian Homes in Europe between the period of 1770 and 1860. The sketches, paintings, and watercolour representations capture the spatial qualities and features of the interiority and decoration of the overall space. The images record accuracy to the shape of the room, from the carpet, to the furniture, pictures, fabrics, wall colour, the hang of curtains and the placement of light. Mario Praz’s work has documented all these interior characteristics that would have shaped the space for the inhabiters in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This work has had a strong contribution to the impact of not only researching the interiority of a space, but provided a new groundwork into recording a history of an interior.\n\nFurther, Praz has made an influential impact on the way interior design has been studied and documented since the mid twentieth century. He helped foster the change in the growth of historical design studies and research. His work, \"An Illustrated History of Interior Decoration\", \"merges a traditional art-historical approach with philosophical musings about the role of interior assemblage\". Praz was one of the first critics to look into the links between the contexts of art history, and link it to the interior workings of a space. He was one of the first designers to note that furnishings were a representation of the individual. This is shown in this writing as he states \"furnishings are tangible artefacts of social history\". The concept about the need of furnishing is addressed in the initial states of this publication. Praz sees the house and its interiority as \"a continuum, which is always in need of furnishing\". Through the grounding of this concept \"Praz takes the idea of the inhabiting subject, and the interior and its decoration, as pre-given concepts for the construction of this history, not ones that have emerged out of particular historical conditions\", thus meaning that the furniture, the home and the interior all act as a \"representational evocation\" of the individual that resides in the home, reflecting the \"character or the personality of the occupant\". Ultimately, Praz challenges the concept of interior design and decoration, highlighting how the individual completely influences how the layout and decoration of their house will be presented. The concept that the interior is a personal reflection of the individual is personally manifested in his spatial autobiography \"The House of Life\". The concepts and documentation style that was presented in \"An Illustrated History of Interior Decoration\" have been continued and challenged through later design writings by other critics and historians.\n\n\"The House of Life\" is the easiest way to understand the concept of the interior representing the individual. Praz’s work allows audiences to delve into the personal interior scope of Mario Praz’s apartment by providing a \"room by room description, of (the) flat in Rome in which (Praz) lived for thirty years\". The thorough recount of the interiority of this space \"shows the apartment (in a manner of a television program), providing autobiographical accounts of associations with furnishings\". This autobiographical recount chronicles architecture and orchestrates the interior, giving the reader a full account of his home and \"offering us the chance to follow the true routes of privacy, and to recreate the Professor’s universe, reduced to the dimensions of the human eye.\" His writing provides an insight into firstly how he accesses the space in which he lives, and how he inhabits that space. \"The House of Life\" basically mimics the writing style of \"An Illustrated History\". This detailed recount and writing style has been mimicked in future design writing, in order to document every aspect of the interiority of a space.\n\nThe concept of horror vacui in art is associated with Praz who used the term to refer to cluttered visual interior design.\"\n\nThe initial findings that are presented through \"An Illustrated History of Interior Decoration\" have made influential impacts on the writings in George Savage’s \"A concise history of Interior Design\". The concepts of linking the interior to social history are basically echoed in Savage’s work. This early influence of Praz’s writing in the mid 60’s continued throughout the remainder of the twentieth century. \nThe concepts that were addressed in Praz’s work \"An Illustrated History of Interior Decoration\" highlight the context of the interior designer, as a profession, in twenty-first century societies. The work of the interior designer needs to be able to mimic individual needs and wants, so the person can correctly be represented in the interiority of their home. This concept was initially introduced and highlighted by Praz, and this statement allows an insight into how the workings of the interior are conducted.\n\nThe varying opinions on Praz’s design work can be seen in the writings of Cyril Connolly and Edmund Wilson. While Wilson praises Praz’s work as a \"masterpiece,\" Connolly calls \"The House of Life\" \"one of the most boring books I have ever read…it's unbelievably exhausting…it has a bravura of boredom, an audacity of ennui that makes one hardly believe one's eyes.\"\n\nIn his preface of ”Voce dietro la scena. Un'antologia personale”, Mario Praz shows his peculiar irony and understatement in reporting cases of misquotations and misinterpretations of his studies or his personality abroad. He reports the following facts: \nIn the \"Life and Letters of Sir Edmund Gosse\", Gosse writes in a letter dated 17 November 1923: \"Mario Praz is an interesting young professor, a great Swinburnian.\" In the \"Italian Pageant\", Derek Patmore states: \"Dr. Mario Praz, so long a staunch friend of England.\" Charles Du Bos writes in his diary in 1923: \"I dined with Abraham and Mario Praz. He is a great friend of Vernon Lee.\" Marie-Anne Comnène, the widow of Benjamin Crémieux, writes in Hommes et Mondes of December 1949: \"There were authoritative critics: Marco Pron, Franci, Rossi, count Morra and Mademoiselle Bellonci, great animators of the Pen Club.\" Marco Pron is actually Mario Praz, misspelled. Charles Jackson says in \"The Outer Edges\": \"Mario Praz and Bertold Brecht make the best reading in the world for a sexual criminal.\" Around 1950, Kadar Jennö translated \"Neoclassic Taste\" into Hungarian; he asserts that comrade Praz is a harsh enemy of capitalism.<br>\nBesides these fun facts, though, Mario Praz has been highly admired in Italy and abroad. Edmund Wilson, in \"The Genie of the Via Giulia\", wrote that Praz \"will come to be known to posterity - so far as a foreigner can judge - as one of the best Italian writers of his time\".\n\n\n"}

Population: 109,155 (2010 Census).\n\nAchinsk is one of the oldest known inhabited places in the area. Paleontological study has shown that people lived here as early as 28,000–20,000 BCE. Some of these ancient caves are located east of the city.\n\nThe modern city, however, was founded on July 25, 1641 as an \"ostrog\" on the Bely Iyus River. After the fire of 1683, it was moved to the Chulym River (a tributary of the Ob); hence, the official foundation date of the city is considered to be July 25, 1683. The name of the location derives from the Turkic tribal group Achi or Achigi. The first fort in 1683 was built with the high stockade square shaped walls. In the corners were placed watch towers. Initially the garrison had fifteen Cossacks patrolling it. In 1710, a new wooden fort on the right bank of the Achinki River was created, at its confluence with the Chulym.\n\nIn 1782, it was granted status of an uyezd town. In the late 19th century, the town became linked on the Trans-Siberian Railway.\nSince 1990, Achinsk has been included in the official list of cities in Russia with historical and cultural value of nationwide significance.\n\nOn August 2019 a massive explosion in a military base () occurred some 20km south of the town, next to the village of Kamenka.\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, Achinsk serves as the administrative center of Achinsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is, together with one urban-type settlement (Mazulsky), incorporated separately as the krai city of Achinsk—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the krai city of Achinsk is incorporated as Achinsk Urban Okrug.\n\nAchinsk grew rapidly in the 20th century: from a population of 32,000 in 1939, to 85,000 in 1969, to 121,572 in the 1989 Census. The population declined slightly in the early 21st century: 118,744 (2002 Census) and 109,155 (2010 Census).\n\nThe economy of Achinsk is based around heavy industry and contains a refinery and also produces construction materials, including wood, asphalt, cement. Mechanical, wax, brick and electrical plants are also present. It is also involved with the food industry and contains dairy factories and a meat processing plant as well as footwear and furniture factories.\n\nThe largest enterprise of the city, the Achinsk Alumina Plant, belongs to the \"Rusal\" group. In addition, the city operates a cement plant which produces about two million tons of cement per year.\n\nThe city operates buses, trams, and taxis, and is served by the Achinsk Airport.\n\nAs of 2006, Achinsk has eleven health facilities and over twenty schools. Notable landmarks include the Achinsk Drama Theater, Achinsk National History Museum, Achinsk Museum and Exhibition Center, and the Kazan Cathedral.\n\nAchinsk has a chilly continental climate (Köppen \"Dfb\") or a slightly warmer subarctic climate (borderline \"Dfc\"), just like its neighbouring cities in southern Krasnoyarsk Krai. Winter is moderately cold, just like Siberia, however some ludicrous temperatures of almost minus sixty has been recorded in January 1931. Summer is mildly hot, maybe a little chilly.\n"}

The genus is named after a French surgeon Dr. Marin Diereville, who introduced the plant to Europe around 1700.\n\nThe bush honeysuckles are low in height (1–2 m), of small to medium diameter (1–2 m), and develop into colonies by means of spreading underground rhizomes. Their leaves are simple, opposite and either oval or lanceolate in shape with a toothed edge. The fall color varies between yellow, orange and red. Small tubular flowers, typically pale yellow, are produced in June and July.\n\n\nOther species formerly included in \"Diervilla\" are now treated in the genus \"Weigela\". The bush honeysuckles are commonly confused with the common wild honeysuckle (\"Lonicera tatarica\"), or the Japanese honeysuckle (\"Lonicera japonica\"), both members of the closely related genus \"Lonicera\".\n\nThe British \"Diervilla\" national collection is held at Sheffield Botanical Gardens; along with the national collection of the closely related genus \"Weigela\".\n\n\"Diervilla\" species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including common emerald and the engrailed.\n\n\n"}

It was owned and operated by Bob Stupak, and was also signed as Bob Stupak's Vegas World.\n\nStupak initially opened a small casino, Bob Stupak's World Famous Million-Dollar Historic Gambling Museum and Casino, on the property in 1974, but it was destroyed in a fire later that year. Stupak later opened Vegas World in July 1979, on the same property. Vegas World opened with 90 hotel rooms and a casino. The hotel ultimately featured 932 rooms and the casino was eventually expanded to .\n\nIn 1984, stuntman Dan Koko set two world records for separate stunts in which he jumped from the rooftop of Vegas World's 25-story hotel tower. Vegas World featured the world's first quarter-million and million-dollar slot-machine jackpots, as well as the world's largest mural, the world's largest Big Six wheel, and reputedly the world's largest exterior sign. Vegas World closed on February 1, 1995, to be remodeled and integrated into Stupak's new project, the Stratosphere. Vegas World's two hotel towers were renovated for use as the Stratosphere's hotel.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Bob Stupak purchased of land at 2000 South Las Vegas Boulevard, located north of the Sahara Hotel and Casino and the Las Vegas Strip, in a seedy part of the city. The land was occupied by the Todkill/Bill Hayden Lincoln Mercury Dealership, and was purchased by Stupak at a cost of $218,000, with money he raised himself and from his father's friends.\n\nOn March 31, 1974, he opened a small casino called Bob Stupak's World Famous Million-Dollar Historic Gambling Museum and Casino. Stupak said, \"The name was about 10 feet longer than the casino.\" The casino featured 15 slot machines, including a quarter slot that offered a $250,000 jackpot and a nickel slot that advertised a $50,000 payout. The casino also featured various memorabilia, including antique slot machines, a gambling chip collection, and photographs of former gambling figures such as Bugsy Siegel. The casino's floors and walls were papered with $1 bills that were covered by plastic. The casino also featured a $100,000 bill.\n\nShortly before 8:00 p.m. on May 21, 1974, a fire broke out at the casino. Nine fire units responded; 35 firefighters battled the fire for several hours, during which a section of South Las Vegas Boulevard had to be closed. The fire was visible for several miles throughout the Las Vegas Valley. The casino was destroyed, although firefighters successfully saved most of the money attached to the casino's walls. The fire was believed to have been caused by an air conditioner. Stupak's insurance company, the San Francisco-based Fireman's Fund American Insurance Company, suspected Stupak of arson and filed a suit against him in June 1975, alleging that he burned down his casino to collect insurance money of $300,000. The insurance company eventually settled the claim.\n\nAfter the fire, Stupak managed to persuade Valley Bank to lend him more than $1 million to complete what would be known as Vegas World. Groundbreaking was scheduled to begin on June 22, 1978, on the same property occupied by Stupak's previous casino. Stupak opened the space-themed Vegas World on July 13, 1979, with 90 hotel rooms in an eight-story tower, and a casino. Construction cost $7 million. Vegas World debuted with the slogan, \"The Sky's the Limit\". At first, Vegas World suffered, only making $7 million in revenue its first year. However, at its peak, Vegas World made $100 million a year in gambling revenues.\n\nStupak began expanding Vegas World in 1983, which included the addition of a 25-story hotel tower, for a total of 400 rooms. The hotel's second and thirteenth floors were not labeled as such; Stupak explained, \"When a shooter hits a two at the dice tables, it's 'snake-eyes,' a loser. No twos, no lose.\" The casino was ultimately increased to . The casino featured the world's first quarter-million and million-dollar slot machine jackpots, as well as the \"world's largest Big Six wheel\", which measured 50 to 60 feet in diameter and required an electric motor to spin. The casino also featured \"crapless craps\", and a blackjack variation known as double exposure 21 that was introduced in 1979. Double exposure 21 became a popular game at many other Las Vegas casinos following its introduction at Vegas World. As of 1980, Vegas World was the only casino in the world to offer triple odds craps. The casino was also considered innovative for offering no-limit wagering and gambling coupons. Vegas World also offered automobiles as jackpot prizes, a concept that was later used in other casinos. Vegas World also featured what was reputedly the largest exterior sign in the world.\n\nOn May 19, 1984, a stuntman named Dan Koko set the world \"fire fall\" record when he jumped off the hotel's roof as part of a stunt, plummeting 250 feet while wearing a flame-resistant suit that had been set on fire. Koko performed another stunt on August 30, 1984, in which he climbed atop a small platform, 326 feet above the ground and positioned on a 90-foot scaffolding, located on the roof of the 25-story hotel tower. Koko subsequently jumped and successfully landed on a 22-foot-high, 2,000-pound air bag that was custom-made for the occasion at a cost of $45,000. Koko became the new holder of the world \"high fall\" record, previously set by Dar Robinson. Inside Vegas World following the stunt, Koko received $1 million in cash from Stupak, as part of a deal they made. It was the highest price ever paid for a free fall stunt. Stupak accepted the deal for the publicity.\n\nDuring the late 1980s, Stupak advertised Vegas World vacation packages through national magazines and mail. In October 1990, the Nevada Gaming Commission filed a complaint against Stupak, alleging that he fraudulently promised customers vacation packages for Vegas World that consisted of free trips, gifts and complimentary gaming tokens. In February 1991, Stupak settled the complaint and was fined $125,000 by the Nevada Gaming Commission.\n\nStupak continued to run newspaper advertisements for \"free Las Vegas vacations\" at Vegas World. Later that year, the Nevada Consumer Affairs Division met with the Gaming Commission to discuss the legality of the advertisements, following the complaint from earlier that year. The Gaming Commission launched an investigation to determine if Stupak broke his earlier settlement deal; Stupak said the advertisements were legal. In those advertisements, Stupak requested a $396 check from customers in exchange for a three-day, two-night stay at Vegas World. Customers would also receive $400 in cash, and other benefits.\n\nIn 1989, Stupak was planning a new 1,012-foot neon sign tower for Vegas World. The idea evolved to include an elevator leading up to an observation deck at the top. Stupak said he wanted the tower to become a local landmark, similar to the Eiffel Tower, the Empire State Building, and the Space Needle. Stupak's tower was approved by the Las Vegas City Council in 1990, at which point Vegas World had become the largest personally owned casino resort in the world. A new wing was added to the 25-story hotel tower in 1990.\n\nAround 6:00 p.m. on May 30, 1991, high winds knocked over Vegas World's large exterior sign, leaving it partially hanging over South Las Vegas Boulevard. Vegas World also suffered a power outage from the high winds, although backup generators provided enough power for some of the casino to remain operational. The sign was restored early the next morning, but loose wires sparked onto the roof and caused a fire. Vegas World was evacuated with the exception of the bottom four floors. Two dozen firefighters responded to the fire. Evacuated guests were allowed to return to their rooms after approximately a half-hour. A crew from Young Electric Sign Company removed the wrecked sign later that morning.\n\nIn September 1991, Stupak was planning for the addition of a 30-story hotel tower on property adjacent to Vegas World. The property was occupied by a building that Stupak had leased to Paul Wolfsohn, who had been operating the Imperial Carpet store inside for 26 years. Wolfsohn challenged Stupak's plans. Stupak stated that the lease allowed for the eviction of Wolfsohn's carpet store within 60 days, despite Wolfsohn's claim that his store could not be evicted because his lease did not expire until May 1993. The Las Vegas City Council was expected to consider Stupak's expansion plans the following month, after the Las Vegas Planning Commission recommended against it due to inadequate parking spaces.\n\nConstruction of Stupak's $32 million Stratosphere observation tower began in February 1992, on property adjacent to Vegas World. On August 29, 1993, around midnight, hundreds of customers evacuated Vegas World when a fire broke out at the half-finished Stratosphere tower. Power went out shortly afterwards. According to employees, a hysterical woman ran through the casino screaming, \"Bob Stupak did this for the insurance money!\" Upon learning of the fire, Marty Allen (of the Allen & Rossi comedy show at Vegas World) and his wife arrived to keep evacuated customers entertained. Evacuated guests were allowed to return a few hours later, around 4:00 a.m.\n\nIn November 1993, Grand Casinos announced plans to purchase 33 percent of the Stratosphere and Vegas World by acquiring shares in Stupak's Stratosphere Corporation. In September 1994, Stupak rehired 36 hotel maids who had been fired for wearing union buttons on their clothing during an ongoing dispute between Stupak and a local union.\n\nVegas World closed on February 1, 1995, for remodeling in order to be integrated into the Stratosphere resort. A majority of Vegas World's final customers consisted of people redeeming their vacation packages. Vegas World's two hotel towers, consisting of 932 rooms, were renovated to become part of the Stratosphere, which opened in April 1996.\n\nVegas World featured an extensive collection of space-themed memorabilia such as rocket sculptures, as well as a replica of the Apollo Lunar Module and a life-sized astronaut that both hung from the ceiling. The hotel featured a spaceport-themed check-in lobby, while other parts of the hotel featured mirrored walls and ceilings in a black interior that was accompanied by stars and plastic columns filled with bubbling, colored liquid. The hotel also featured what was claimed to be genuine moon rocks (approximately the size of rice grains), which Stupak somehow obtained from the Nicaraguan government. Vegas World was also known for having $1 million in cash on display in the casino.\n\nDuring the 1980s, artists Robert Barnett Newman (an original member of The Motels) and Paul Whitehead created various space-themed murals on Vegas World's two hotel towers, measuring 25 and 10 stories high. At the time, it set a record in \"The Guinness Book of Records\" for the world's largest mural. One of the murals featured an astronaut gambling in space. After its closure, much of Vegas World's space memorabilia wound up in a collection of various items owned by Lonnie Hammargren, a local collector and former Lieutenant Governor of Nevada, who was also an aspiring astronaut.\n\nAnthony Curtis of the \"Las Vegas Advisor\" opined that Vegas World was \"one of the most bizarre casinos in the city's history\", and wrote that its buffet, The Moon Rock, was \"infamous for being among the worst in town.\" Author Jeff Burbank wrote that Vegas World was one of Las Vegas' \"strangest and most outlandish hotel-casinos ever\", calling it \"a reflection\" of Stupak and stating that its casino interior was \"the weirdest in town\" because of its outer space theme.\n\nDuring the mid-1980s and into the 1990s, Vegas World featured a show starring a Frank Sinatra impersonator, titled Reflections of Sinatra. Vegas World's Galaxy Theatre, with seating for 1,330 people, opened on May 27, 1988. In October 1988, the comedy duo of Allen & Rossi filmed a television special inside the Galaxy Theater to mark their 25th anniversary as a team. In 1989, Allen & Rossi signed a \"lifetime deal\" to perform at Vegas World.\n\nZsa Zsa Gabor was the headliner at Vegas World's Galaxy Showroom for a six-day period from December 1990 to January 1991. It had been two decades since Gabor had performed in Las Vegas. Allen and Rossi's comedy show at Vegas World ended in 1993. During the 1990s, Vegas World's showroom featured an Elvis Presley impersonation show, titled Memories of Elvis and starring E.P. King.\n\nIn 1980, Vegas World was featured in a segment on CBS' \"60 Minutes\" program. Vegas World was briefly featured in the 1984 film, \"Las Vegas Caper\", as well as the 1985 film, \"Fever Pitch\". Vegas World was used prominently for NBC's television series, \"Crime Story\", with many of the show's interior scenes being shot there. By 1988, Vegas World had been featured again on \"60 Minutes\", and had also appeared on \"The Merv Griffin Show\" and \"Ripley's Believe It or Not!\". In August 1989, scenes were shot inside Vegas World for \"Queen of Diamonds\", directed by experimental film maker Nina Menkes.\n"}

Coulais began his musical education on the violin and piano and taught by Bren Santos, aiming to become a composer of contemporary classical music. However, a series of acquaintances gradually re-oriented him towards film music. Coulais met François Reichenbach, who asked him in 1977 to sonorize his documentary \"México mágico\" who permit to compose the first soundtracks for Jacques Davila \"qui trop embrasse\" en 1986 . Until the end of the 1990s, he remained low-profile, composing mainly for television. His name can often be found from TV films by Gérard Marx and Laurent Heynemann. He also composed the soundtracks for Christine Pascal's 1992 film \"Le petit prince a dit\", and Agnès Merlet's \"Le fils du requin\" in 1993.\n\nIn 1994, he met the television producer Josée Dayan, who let him write a theme for the TV series \"La rivière esperance\", aired on the France 2 network in autumn 1995. He worked with Dayan again with other major productions such as \"Le Comte de Monte-Cristo\", \"Balzac\", and \"Les nuiteux\".\n\nThe largest turning point of his career came in 1996, when he worked with directors Claude Nuridsany and Marie Pérennou of the documentary \"Microcosmos\". This single film, which gave a great significance to the music in it, was a great success and made Coulais one of the most wanted composers of French film music. In 1997, he won the \"César\" award for the best musical score in a film, as well as a \"Victoire de la Musique\". His reputation was confirmed by the soundtracks to \"Himalaya\" (1999) and \"Les rivières pourpres\" (2000), and after that Bruno Coulais's name was to be found on most new French blockbusters, such as \"Belphégor\" and \"Vidocq\".\n\nAfter producing the soundtrack to \"Winged Migration\" in 2001, Coulais announced that he wanted to significantly reduce his contributions to film music, and instead concentrate on other projects, such as the creation of an opera for children, and collaborations with Akhenaton, Akhenaton's group IAM and the Corsican group A Filetta, with whom he had worked since he had made the soundtrack for Jacques Weber's film \"Don Juan\" in 1998.\n\nIn 2002, his name was found on the ending credits of the animation \"L'enfant qui voulait être un ours\", and in 2004, on Frédéric Schoendoerffer's \"Agents secrets\". The same year, he wrote the soundtrack to the film \"Les choristes\" by Christophe Barratier, which subsequently became an international hit. The music for this film received as great praise as the film itself, and it won Coulais his third \"César\" award. Since then, Coulais's collaborations in cinema seem to be limited to works by directors with whom he already shares some history, in particular Jacques Perrin, Frédéric Schoendoerffer, and James Huth.\n\nIn 2009, he won at the 37th Annie Awards, in the \"Music in a Feature Production\" category for \"Coraline\".\n\nIn 2009 he also collaborated with Irish band Kíla to produce the soundtrack for the beautifully and uniquely animated feature film, \"The Secret of Kells\", which tells the story of a parentless boy, Brendan, and his involvement with The Book of Kells.

It shared its northern border with the Kingdom of Gumma, its eastern border with the Kingdom of Gomma, and was separated from the Kingdom of Kaffa to the south by the Gojeb River. With its capital at Chala (Cira), the Gera kingdom's territory corresponds approximately with the modern woreda of Gera.\n\nThe Kingdom of Gera was located in a basin surrounded with gently undulating hills, although extensive swampland existed in the northern hills. The population of this kingdom was estimated in 1880 to have been between 15,000 and 16,000. The planting and harvesting of corn followed a different calendar in Gera from the other Gibe kingdoms; where the others planted in February and harvested in July, in Gera it was planted in April and harvested in August. Mohammed Hassen adds that Gera \"was, and still is, the rich land of honey\" and notes that Gera honey had a reputation as the finest honey in Ethiopia. Hassen lists eight kinds of honey cultivated in Gera, the best being the \"Ebichaa\" (\"dark\") honey, from which was made a mead known as \"dadhi\", the drink of royalty and dignitaries in the Gibe region. \"It is not surprising, therefore,\" Hassen concludes, \"that the flavorsome and prestigious \"Ebichaa\" was a royal monopoly.\"\n\nGera is also the location of Mount Ijersa, which the Oromo regard as sacred. They believe that God will take his seat there at the time of the Last Judgement.\n\nRulers of the kingdom held the royal title of \"Donacho\".\n\nAccording to Beckingham and Huntingford, there is evidence that the monarchy of Gera existed before the Great Oromo migration in the 16th century. However, according to Mohammed Hassen Gera was the last of the Gibe kingdoms to come into existence, and was founded by Gunji, \"a successful war leader who made himself king\" around 1835, but died shortly afterwards. This dynasty came to an end with the murder of Tulu Ganje by king Oncho of Gumma. A new one was founded by Abba Baso, who proved to be an unpopular ruler. He was later overthrown by his brother Abba Rago and exiled to Jimma.\n\nAccording to Trimingham, the kingdom enjoyed its greatest prosperity under king Abba Magal, who had been converted to Islam, although a number of his subjects still professed Christianity. It unclear which Gibe king was responsible for this conversion: Trimingham attributes this achievement to Abba Jubir of Gumma; Mohammed Hassen gives the initial credit to Abba Bagibo of Limmu-Ennarea, who offered to support Abba Magal in his fight for the throne if he allowed Muslim missionaries into his kingdom, and only later did Abba Jubir convert him. On King Abba Magal's death, his wife Genne Fa acted as regent for their son, both of whom became prisoners in Jimma when Gera was conquered by \"Dejazmach\" Besha Abua in 1887.\n\n"}

WJLB's transmitter is located in Highland Park near the intersection of Hamilton Avenue and Midland Street, and transmits its signal from an antenna 489 feet in height with an Effective radiated power of 50,000 watts.\n\nThe station traces its origins to a testing station which began operations on May 7, 1941, with 1,000 watts of power at 44.9 megahertz frequency. On May 24, it officially began broadcasting as W49D, Michigan's second FM radio station. It was owned by John Lord Booth, who was born in Detroit on June 13, 1907, and died in Grosse Pointe Farms on November 11, 1994, at the age of 87.\n\nOn September 12, 1945, W49D was assigned a full-powered frequency at 96.5 MHz and renamed WLOU. In June 1948, the station moved up to the 97.9 frequency as WMZK, which was a play on the word \"music\", with a format of automated beautiful music. In later years, WMZK alternated between beautiful music and foreign-language programming for various ethnic groups. In 1979, the station carried the pro softball games of the Detroit Caesars.\n\nIn 1980, the WJLB callsign migrated to the FM dial at 97.9, alongside with an Urban Contemporary format from the 1400 kHz AM frequency. WJLB-AM, which went on the air as WMBC in 1926 and adopted the WJLB callsign in 1939, had been providing programming geared toward Detroit's black community for nearly four decades.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, the stereo FM station was transformed as a hybrid Top 40 (CHR)/Urban Contemporary (also called \"CHUrban\", which would be the forerunner to the current Rhythmic CHR format) known as \"WJLB fm 98, Detroit's Strongest Songs!\"; the format would eventually gravitate to a full-blown urban. WJLB-AM continued to program to the African-American community in Detroit for nearly a quarter-century afterward as WQBH, and is now WDTK, owned by Salem Communications with a conservative news/talk format. Within a few years, WJLB-FM performed well in the Detroit Arbitron ratings, despite picking up competition from several competitors, including WHYT, which was mostly dance and Top 40, but in 1992, would flip to \"96.3 Jamz\" and aired a rhythmic contemporary format, and then in 1996 at the 105.9 frequency, the former jazz-formatted WJZZ, which became WCHB-FM \"The Beat\", and later WDTJ \"105.9 Jamz\" (now urban AC-formatted WDMK \"105.9 Kiss-FM\"). FM98 was famous for its specialty Friday mix shows with \"Electrifying Mojo\" and the \"Sunday Night Segue,\" hosted by John \"Johnny Smooth\" Edwards, featuring classic \"Quiet Storm\" tracks, as well for the highly successful morning shows that made WJLB the strongest station in Detroit from John Mason and his legendary \"\"Mason And Company\"\" morning show all the way to MC Serch of 3rd Bass and his morning show.\n\nIn April 1994, Booth American Company merged with Broadcast Alchemy to become Secret Communications. In August, Chancellor Media acquired the station from Secret Communications. In 1997, Chancellor Media and Evergreen, which already owned WKQI \"Q95.5\" and WQRS, later merged to form AMFM, Inc. In November 1999, AMFM, Inc. was purchased by Clear Channel Communications. WJLB and sister station WMXD have been under the Clear Channel banner ever since. Over the last several years, WJLB has shifted to a more younger emphasizing playlist with more Hip Hop and less Old school and House music which the station was built on in the 1990s through 2005.\n\nAs of October 2017, the station rebranded as \"97.9 WJLB\", utilizing a logo template mainly utilized by iHeart's number of \"Real\"-branded urban stations. Until October 2017, the station was formerly known by its branding \"FM98\".\n\nWJLB's HD2 side channel features a rhythmic oldies (including classic disco, dance and soul) format known as \"Funkytown,\" which changed from a Classic Hip-Hop format in the fall of 2013.\n\n"}

It was the follow-up to their debut, \"3D EP\", released three months earlier. \"White Music\" reached No. 38 in the UK Albums Chart and spawned the single \"Statue of Liberty\", which was banned by the BBC for the lyric \"In my fantasy I sail beneath your skirt\". In April 1978, the group rerecorded \"This Is Pop\" as their third single.\n\nThe track \"Radios in Motion\" has become one of the band's better-known songs. In a 2009 interview, Andy Partridge stated, \"We couldn't think of any better way to start off our first album than with the ‘kick the door in’, breezy opener we used in our live set... the lyrics are very silly, picked for their sonic effect rather than meaning. The first refuge of an inexperienced songwriter, forgive me, but they do have a youthful scattergun energy.\" The song is considered representative of the band's \"agitated amphetamine rock\" style of their earlier works, though others would call it \"relatively tame mod-pop\". The song mentions Milwaukee in the lyrics because Partridge's aunt lived in that city.\n\n\"Village Voice\" critic Robert Christgau wrote in his review of the album: \"Although it took a year and a half for this debut album by the premier English art-pop band to get released in the States, two Andy Partridge songs on side one aim directly at the American market—'Radios in Motion,' which mentions Milwaukee, surely isn't about the BBC, and the avowed purpose of 'Statute of Liberty' is to get a look up her skirts. The third, 'This Is Pop,' is why he missed—radio programmers resent anyone telling them their business, especially subversives who favor herky-jerk rhythms, jerky-herk harmonies, Lene Lovich radar noises, and depressing subject matter. Colin Moulding's songs, on the other hand, are aimed at bored Yes fans, which is why he missed—the lad doesn't know that Yes fans like being bored.\"\n\nThe band performed \"Radios in Motion\", \"I'll Set Myself on Fire\", \"Statue of Liberty\" on BBC Two's \"The Old Grey Whistle Test\" on 14 February 1978.\n\nXTC\nTechnical\n"}

It began construction on November 3, 1911, by the French architect Daniel Beylard; and inaugurated March 1, 1917. It is of French Renaissance style with modern touches. It was decorated by the Italian architect Lucio Cappellaro, and its Great Hall is one of the most beautiful and elegant in Central America.\n\nPanama's National Theater was opened in 1903. That is the oldest theater in Central America.\n\nA competition was held to choose a design for the theatre. The prizes for the first two places were 8,000 and 4,000 Francs each. The entries were reviewed by a commission composed of the engineers José E. Alcaine, Luis Fleury, and Aurelio Fuentes. The 12 plans submitted were from the following countries: 5 from France, 2 from the United States, 1 from the Principality of Monaco, 1 from Italy, and 3 from El Salvador. The winning project was \"Melpemone\" by the French Architect Daniel Beylard. The construction contract was awarded to the Salvadoran firm Ferracutti y Cía. José María Peralta Lagos was the head engineer during construction.\n\nAfter 59 years of constant activity, in 1976, a process of remodeling was begun under the direction of the Salvadoran architect, Ricardo Jiménez Castillo. Funds were provided by the Salvadoran government. Castillo hired a select group of contributors: Roberto Salomón, to establish the requirements of the contemporary stage; Simón Magaña, for the decoration; Carlos Cañas, for the elaboration of murals; and Margarita Álvarez de Martínez, for the masterful copper artwork that would adorn the doors to the theatre boxes. Afterwards artisans of Ilobasco joined the team and students of the then \"Bachillerato en Artes\" led by the master artisan Carlos Cañas.\n\nMultiple architectural styles were enriched in the fusion of the construction of the National Theatre including: Versailles Style, Rococo, Romanticism, and Art Nouveau, with regional touches. Some of the furniture was elaborated in the shop of the theatre, the rest of the furniture, rugs, carpets, armchairs, and lecterns, were imported from the United States. The drop curtains of the stage and the lights of the boxes and halls, were brought from Austria.\n\nIn 1977, the master artisan Carlos Cañas painted the cupola of the great hall with the fresco entitled \"El mestizaje cultural\", \"The Cultural Convergence\", that occupies an area of 230 m2 approximately. Thanks to this work, the ambiance reminds you of the great hall of Palais Garnier, decorated with Chagall artwork. The reinauguration of the National Theatre took place November 5, 1978 with the presentation of the National Award of Culture, which was given to the great Antonio Salazar, and Dr. Julio Fausto Hernández. The following year, on February 16, 1979 it was declared a National Monument by the Legislative Assembly. Since then, it has maintained in constant activity with theatre, music, dance, recitals, conferences, and acts of great importance in the political and cultural life of El Salvador. In 1992, the government of Japan presented a modern sound and light system to the theatre.\n"}

Appel (c. 1875–1940) and Carl Appel (c. 1873–1935), Lila Lee was born Augusta Wilhelmena Fredericka Appel on July 25, 1905 in Union Hill, New Jersey (now part of Union City), into a middle-class family of German immigrants who relocated to New York City. She had an older sister, Pauline (1900–1985), who had been born in Hamburg, Germany.\n\nSearching for a hobby for their gregarious young daughter, the Appels enrolled Lila in Gus Edwards' kiddie review shows where she was given the nickname of \"Cuddles\"; a name that she would be known by for the rest of her acting career. Her stagework became so popular with the public that her parents had her educated with private tutors. Edwards would become Lee's long-term manager.\n\nLillian Edwards, wife of Gus Edwards, was Lee's guardian. When Lee was 15 years old, she went to court seeking an injunction to prevent Mrs. Edwards \"from collecting any money for Lila's services.\" Mrs. Edwards countered that she had spent 10 years helping to shape Lee's career and had invested money in her.\n\nLee performed in vaudeville for eight years.\n\nIn 1918, she was chosen for a film contract by Hollywood film mogul Jesse Lasky for Famous Players-Lasky Corporation, which later became Paramount Pictures. Her first feature \"The Cruise of the Make-Believes\" garnered the seventeen-year-old starlet much public acclaim and Lasky quickly sent Lee on an arduous publicity campaign. Critics lauded Lila for her wholesome persona and sympathetic character parts. Lee quickly rose to the ranks of leading lady and often starred opposite such matinee heavies as Conrad Nagel, Gloria Swanson, Wallace Reid, Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle, and Rudolph Valentino. Lee bore more than a slight resemblance to Ann Little, a former Paramount star and frequent Reid co-star who was leaving the film business and at this stage in her career an even stronger resemblance to Marguerite Clark.\n\nIn 1922 Lee was cast as \"Carmen\" in the enormously popular film \"Blood and Sand\", opposite matinee idol Rudolph Valentino and silent screen vamp Nita Naldi; Lee subsequently won the first WAMPAS Baby Stars award that year. Lee continued to be a highly popular leading lady throughout the 1920s and made scores of critically praised and widely watched films.\n\nAs the \"Roaring Twenties\" drew to a close, Lee's popularity began to wane and Lee positioned herself for the transition to talkies. She is one of the few leading ladies of the silent screen whose popularity did not nosedive with the coming of sound. She went back to working with the major studios and appeared, most notably, in \"The Unholy Three\", in 1930, opposite Lon Chaney Sr. in his only talkie. However, a series of bad career choices and bouts of recurring tuberculosis and alcoholism hindered further projects and Lee was relegated to taking parts in mostly grade B-movies.\n\nLee was married and divorced three times. Her first husband was actor James Kirkwood, Sr., whom she married on July 26, 1923. The marriage ended in August 1931 on grounds of her desertion. Lee and Kirkwood had a son in 1924, James Kirkwood, Jr., whose custody was granted to his father; he became a highly regarded playwright and screenwriter whose works include \"A Chorus Line\" and \"P.S. Your Cat Is Dead\". Her second husband was broker Jack R. Peine and her third husband was broker John E. Murphy. According to author Sean Egan in the James Kirkwood biography \"Ponies & Rainbows\" (2011), Murphy's will left Lee at the financial mercy of his second wife, who consequently became the manipulative character Aunt Claire in \"P.S. Your Cat Is Dead\", written by Lee's son, James Kirkwood, Jr.\n\nIn the 1930s she was diagnosed with tuberculosis and moved to Saranac Lake, New York for treatment at the Will Rogers Memorial Hospital. Lee made several uneventful appearances in stage plays in the 1940s, and starred in early television soap operas in the 1950s.\n\nIn 1973 Lee died of a stroke at Saranac Lake.\n\nFor her contribution as an actress in motion pictures, she was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1716 Vine Street. It was dedicated on February 8, 1960.\n\n"}

Some of her best-known work was in the plays of Athol Fugard.\n\nShe was born Yvonne Heilbuth in Cape Town, South Africa, the daughter of Adolphus Walter Heilbluth, a railway foreman, and Clara Ethel (\"née\" Sanderson). She was educated at St. Mary's Convent, Hope St., Cape Town.\n\nBryceland worked as a newspaper librarian for the \"Cape Argus\" before her professional theatrical début in \"Stage Door\" in 1947, becoming an actress with the Cape Performing Arts Board in 1964. Prior to her professional career, she had performed as an amateur at the Barn Theatre in Constantia which had been founded by David Bloomberg who later became the mayor of Cape Town. Having had no formal training prior to becoming a professional actress, Bryceland took private lessons with acting teacher Rita Maas (RADA, LAMDA), who with her husband, Morris Phillips, a ballroom dancer, founded the Maas-Phillips School of Dance, Speech and Drama, in Cape Town in the 1950s.\n\nYvonne's first husband was an immigrant from England named Danny Bryceland, a real-estate salesman. The relationship became abusive and, although a devout Roman Catholic, after urgent consultations with her priest, they were divorced in 1960. They had three children – daughters Colleen, Melanie, and Mavourneen, the latter also having a brief but well-received career as an actress.\n\nIn 1969, Bryceland performed in the première of Athol Fugard's play \"Boesman and Lena\" and repeated the role in the 1974 film version.\n\nDescribed as the first lady of South African theatre, Bryceland was a committed artist who, in 1972, defied racial segregation by co-founding, with her second husband, Brian Astbury, South Africa's first non-racial theatre, the Space Theatre in Cape Town.\n\nShe joined the Royal National Theatre in 1978, making her acclaimed début in \"The Woman\" by Edward Bond. She remained with the National Theatre for eight years. She received the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in 1985 for her performance in \"The Road to Mecca\".\n\nFugard attempted to have \"The Road to Mecca\" produced in New York in 1985 but Actors Equity refused to grant Bryceland permission to perform on Broadway on the grounds that she was not an \"international star\" and therefore not entitled to preference over an American actress. She performed the role in a 1987 production at the Spoleto Festival, which is not subject to Equity contracts, receiving a rave review from the \"Chicago Tribune\":\nFor sheer emotional range, Bryceland's performance is phenomenal. Barefoot at times, wrapped in a worn cardigan whose sleeves seem to want to cover her hands, the actress journeys from failing old age to heights of insight. She suggests a person reborn into a faith of her own invention. It is a difficult part in a play that is far from easy, but Bryceland gives it a sustained glow.\n\nAs a result of the dispute with Equity, Fugard refused to allow the play to be produced by any other company in the United States. In July 1987, Equity relented and gave permission for Bryceland to perform. In 1988, Bryceland appeared in a New York production at the Promenade Theater, off-Broadway, with Fugard as the clergyman and Amy Irving as Miss Helen's friend Elsa, receiving an Obie Award for her performance, as well as a Theatre World Award. In 1989, Bryceland reprised her role alongside Fugard at the Eisenhower Theater at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., Kathy Bates playing the part of Elsa, a role she also played in the film version.\n\nIn 1987, Bryceland participated in an educational programme at Cornell University developed by the Education Department of the National Theatre of Great Britain for actors in training.\n\n\n\n\nYvonne Bryceland died of complications from cancer in 1992 at age 66 in London, United Kingdom.\n\nHer name has sometimes been misspelled as Yvonne Brayceland.\n\n"}

It was the location of the former Oromo and Sidama kingdoms of Gera, Gomma, Garo, Gumma, Jimma, and Limmu-Ennarea.\n\nTo the north of the Gibe region lay the Macha tribe of the Oromo.\n\nUntil the mid 16th century, this region was part of the Sidama kingdoms of Ennarea, Hadiya, Janjero and Kaffa, tributary states to the Ethiopian Solomonic dynasty. The area was separated however, when the Oromo migrated into the area, destroying Hadiya, isolating Janjero, and reduced the area of Enerea and Kaffa. In the Gibe region, the Oromo came under the cultural influence of the kingdom of Kaffa, from whom they borrowed the concept of hereditary kingship (called Moti in all of the kingdoms except Limmu-Enerea, where for historical reasons the king was known as the \"Supera\"), and the practice of delimiting the boundaries or frontier of their states with a system of physical barriers.\n\nThese barriers consisted of palisades or dead hedges, which could extend for miles, separated from the barriers of the neighboring kingdom by a neutral strip (called \"moga\"), which was left uncultivated and inhabited only by brigands and outlaws. Access into each kingdom was limited to guarded gates known as \"kella\", where tolls were levied\n\nThese kingdoms had an economy based on exports of gold, civet musk, coffee, and slaves. G.W.B. Huntingford explains that slaves were taken in raids on the Macha tribe to the north, and in raids on the Sidamo kingdoms of Kaffa and Janjero; he also cites evidence to show that 7,000 people a year were sold each year, some to people inside Ethiopia, and some outside that country.\n\nThe Gibe region, with the rest of southwestern Ethiopia, was almost entirely annexed between 1886 and 1900 in a series of conquests by the generals of Emperor Menelik II. The kingdom of Jimma, through skillful diplomacy, managed to delay this fate until the death of its king Abba Jifar II in 1932.\n"}

About 98 percent of the company's net sales are derived from the sale of auto-dimming mirrors to every major automaker in the world.\n\nGentex was founded in 1974 by Fred Bauer as a manufacturer of fire protection products. The company created the first dual-sensor photoelectric smoke detector, considered to be less prone to false alarms, while still quickly detecting smoldering fires. In the early 1990s, Gentex introduced a smoke detector equipped with a strobe light designed to alert the deaf and hard of hearing individuals.

Set in the early 1980s, the play follows a group of history pupils preparing for the Oxford and Cambridge entrance examinations under the guidance of three teachers (Hector, Irwin, and Lintott) with contrasting styles.\n\nHector, an eccentric teacher, delights in knowledge for its own sake but his ambitious headmaster wants the school to move up the academic league table and hires Irwin, a supply teacher, to introduce a rather more cynical and ruthless style of teaching. Hector is discovered sexually fondling a boy and later Irwin's latent homosexual inclinations emerge.\n\nThe character of Hector was based on the schoolmaster and author Frank McEachran (1900–1975).\n\n\nIrwin is said to be modelled after Niall Ferguson.\n\nThe play includes several non-speaking roles:\n\nThe play opened at the Lyttelton Theatre (part of the National Theatre) in London on 18 May 2004, directed by Nicholas Hytner.

He has also worked under the aliases Chill, AKH, Sentenza, and Spectre. He became famous as a member of the group IAM, and has since made a number of records, both with IAM and as a solo artist.\n\nAkhenaton has worked as a producer, producing songs for several French rappers and groups such as Passi, Stomy Bugsy, Fonky Family, Freeman (a fellow member of IAM who has since made his break as a solo artist), La Brigade, Le 3ème Œil, etc. He is the creator of the record label Côté Obscur, the publishing house La Cosca, and the vinyl record label 361.\n\nAkhenaton was born Philippe Fragione in Marseille in 1968, and spent his youth in Plan-de-Cuques, a small village on the outskirts of the city. His family is of Italian origins. His paternal grandmother, Immacolata Scotti, was of Campanian descent, his great-grandfather Francesco Fragione, emigrated from Sperlonga and on his maternal side a great-great-grandfather, Pierre Malano, emigrated from Porte, a great-great-great-grandfather Barthelemy Gionotti, emigrated from Camporgiano and another great-grandmother Maria Lanzarotti, emigrated from Bedonia. In 1981, he discovered hip hop music and started traveling frequently to New York City where he received the nickname \"Chill Phil.\" At about the same time, back in Marseille, he met Éric Mazel, a DJ who would later be known as \"Khéops\". Mazel and Fragione started working together to advance the cause of French hip hop. \n\nIn 1988, Fragione debuted as a hip hop theorist, publishing the essay \"La deuxième génération du hip-hop\" (The second generation of hip-hop) in the fanzine \"Vé\". The same year, he appeared on the B-side of the US rapper MC Choice's single \"Let's Make Some Noise\". Having returned to Marseille, he met Geoffroy Mussard (Shurik'n) and Malek Brahimi (Freeman). Fragione became known as Akhenaton, and together with Khéops and Shurik'n formed the group \"B.Boys Stance\", renamed IAM in 1989. The group was later joined by Freeman, Imhotep and Kephren.\n\nFour of the six members of IAM chose ancient Egyptian names as stage names. Akhenaton converted to Islam from Catholicism. Musicologists argue that Akhenaton and the other members of IAM index the modern Arab world through the use of their names. Instead of overtly pointing out North African countries and the turmoil that has surrounded the contemporary Arab community, the Egyptian names allow the audience to covertly draw parallels between IAM and North Africa.\n\nInstead of focusing on violence and rebellion like many other French rappers, Akhenaton and IAM remain true to their hometown, Marseille. In Marseille rap has reportedly remained relatively peaceful. Akhenaton posits that rappers in Marseille are more socially conscious because they feel a strong sense of community.\n\nAfter IAM's first three albums' success, Akhenaton released his first solo album, \"Métèque et mat\", in 1995. The album sold 300,000 copies, and it was followed by \"Sol Invictus\" in 2001. He began to delve into his other projects, such as producing Passi's album \"Les tentations\" (1997) and the 2001 film \"Comme un aimant\". He continued working with IAM, releasing the album \"Revoir un printemps\" in 2003 and \"Saison 5\" in 2007. \n\n"}
{"id": "2315980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2315980", "title": "International Thespian Society", "text": "International Thespian Society\n\nThe International Thespian Society (ITS) is an honor society for high school and middle school theatre students. It is a division of the Educational Theatre Association. Thespian troupes serve students in grades 9-12; Junior Thespian troupes serve students in grades 6 through 8. A few famous ITS alumni include Tom Hanks, Val Kilmer, James Marsters, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Stephen Schwartz. Festivals are held annually at the state and national levels. Each June the organization holds the International Thespian Festival. For 25 years it was held at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. As of 2019 it is being held at Indiana University-Bloomington where the first ITF was held in 1941. Membership currently stands at approximately 139,000 student members across 5,000 schools. The one millionth Thespian was inducted in 1976 and the two millionth Thespian was inducted in 2009. As of 2019, there have been over 2.4 million Thespians inducted.\n\nThe International Thespian Society was founded in 1929 in Fairmont, West Virginia. Originally named National Thespians, the society was founded by Dr. Paul Opp, Earnest Bavely and Harry T. Leeper. National Thespians was an honorary organization for high school theater students who earned membership through participation in their schools' theatre programs. The organization consisted of troupes, each linked to a school. The first troupe was formed by Dr. Earl Blank at Natrona County High School in Casper, Wyoming.\n\nAt the end of the 1928-1929 school year there were 71 troupes across 26 states. In October, 1929, the first issue of The High School Thespian, \"official organ of National Thespians\" was published. The National Thespian headquarters was moved to Cincinnati during the year 1935. That same year, the society was renamed The National Thespian Dramatic Honor Society. The society held its first National High School Drama Conference and Play Production Festival in 1941 at Indiana University, which later became a bi-annual event. The \"High School Thespian\" became \"Dramatics\" in 1944.\n\nIn October 1945, The National Thespian Dramatic Honor Society was again renamed the National Thespian Society. As the Thespian Society reached its 25th anniversary in 1954, 1,432 Thespian troupes existed across forty-eight states and the then-territories of Alaska, Hawaii, and the Canal Zone, as well as Canada and Japan. In 1969 the organization's name was changed to the title it still holds today: The International Thespian Society. June 1982 marked a name change for the National High School Drama Conference and Play Production Festival, turning it into the Thespian Festival, as it is still called today. The Thespian Festival also began an annual schedule for the first time.\n\nThe Society offered its first set of summertime retreats for high school theatre directors in 1986, an activity that would eventually grow into a professional association called the Theatre Education Association. In 1989 the ITS board established the Educational Theatre Association (EdTA), meant to oversee both the Thespian Society and the Theatre Education Association, and launched \"Teaching Theatre,\" a quarterly journal for theatre educators. The Theatre Education Association was eventually absorbed completely into the EdTA and thus its title is no longer used.\n\n1990 marks the birth of the Junior Thespians branch of ITS, extending the reach of the society to middle school theatre students. The EdTA helped to write the theatre section of the National Standards for Arts Education, the first set of guidelines for the arts education field, in 1994. By 2012, International Thespian Society had formed a strong bond with the charity organization Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS and raised more than $1 million for their benefit. 2015 marked the EdTA's launch of JumpStart Theatre, which brings sustainable musical theatre programs to underserved middle schools where there currently are none, and the creation of an ITS branch in China.\n\nChapters are created in order to support the mission of the International Thespian Society. They are led by a chapter director who is supported and assisted by a chapter board. As of 2019, there are active chapters in the following 50 states, and 13 countries:\n\nMaine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Nevada, California, Hawaii, the Western Pacific Islands, British Columbia, Ontario, and China.\n\nThe International Thespian Society allows for the induction of high school and middle school students attending ITS affiliated schools, based on the quality and quantity of work in all realms of theatre. Points can be earned from participation in productions (either on stage or backstage), Thespian Festivals, seeing other theatre's productions, and holding an officer position in a Thespian troupe.\n\nInduction ceremonies vary from troupe to troupe, but most are run by the troupe's officers and director. They include, at the very least, a brief summation of the Society's history, followed by a listing of the names and achievements of each new inductee, and then a reciting of the Society's pledge by all new and existing members. The pledge is as follows: \"\"I promise to uphold the aims and ideals of the International Thespian Society. I am a student of theatre and excellence is my ideal. I promise to perform my part as well as I can; to accept praise and criticism with grace; to cooperate with my fellow thespians and work for the good of the troupe; and to share my love of theatre.\"\"After induction, members can continue to earn points in order to move up through the International Thespian Society ranking system.\n\nAt the high school level there are various offices possible, including, but not limited to, President, Vice President, Treasurer, Secretary, and Historian. There are also state and international student leaders elected annually by their respective student bodies. The International Thespian Officers are student members elected to represent the student membership. They suggest policy and service changes to the Educational Theatre Association Board, and take an active role in training, chapter conferences, and the annual International Thespian Festival. There are also State Thespian Officers, elected to manage such events as State Thespian Festivals and local Junior Thespian Festivals.\n\n"}
{"id": "2315985", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2315985", "title": "SimplexGrinnell", "text": "SimplexGrinnell\n\nSimplexGrinnell, a subsidiary of Tyco International, is an American company specializing in active fire protection systems, communication systems and testing, inspection and maintenance services. The company headquarters is in Boca Raton, Florida; corporate sales and marketing offices are in Westminster, Massachusetts, and the company has about 160 district offices throughout North America. It is currently the largest fire protection company in the world.\n\nGrinnell Fire Protection was purchased by Tyco in 1976. Tyco bought Simplex Time Recorder Company on January 5, 2001, for US$1.15 billion and merged it with Grinnell Fire Protection, forming SimplexGrinnell. On September 6, 2016, Johnson Controls and Tyco completed a merger. In May 2017, Johnson Controls announced that the brand identity of SimplexGrinnell will be transitioned to Johnson Controls. SimplexGrinnell's fire sprinkler services will become Grinnell Fire Protection Solutions, a separate brand under Johnson Controls. Johnson Controls will continue to sell Simplex fire and security products under the Simplex brand name.\n\nFrederick Grinnell, an 1855 graduate of Rensselaer Institute (now Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), worked in railroad engineering until he retired as chief mechanical engineer and general manager of the Jersey City Locomotive Works. Soon after his retirement, he purchased a controlling interest in the Providence Steam and Gas Pipe Company.\n\nGrinnell already knew Henry S. Parmalee, who patented the first automatic fire sprinkler head in 1874. Providence Steam & Gas partnered with Parmalee and manufactured the Parmalee sprinkler; Grinnell also designed and erected the piping installations into which the Parmalee sprinkler heads were fitted. Grinnell improved Parmalee's first practical automatic sprinkler and patented his own Grinnell sprinkler in 1882. Continual improvements resulted in the glass disc sprinkler in 1890. With slight modifications, this sprinkler head is still used in modern fire sprinkler systems; sprinklers are even called \"le Grinnells\" in France. In 1892, Grinnell organized the General Fire Extinguisher Company, which was renamed the Grinnell Fire Protection Company after his death in 1919. The main manufacturing facility was in North Carolina at the Grinnell Company-General Fire Extinguisher Company Complex.\n\nMeanwhile, Edward G. Watkins founded the Simplex Time Recorder Company in 1894. Watkins invented and patented one of the first practical time clocks, along with the synchronized clock systems seen in schools up until recent times. The company, located in Gardner, Massachusetts, purchased the IBM Time Equipment Division in 1958. This purchase included IBM's fire protection division. Originally, Simplex's fire alarm line simply consisted of relabeled IBM devices and control panels (including the 4217 and possibly the 4201 series), but they began to introduce redesigned IBM products starting in the early 1960s, including the 4245, 4246, and 4247 series control panels. In the mid-1960s, Simplex attempted to introduce low-voltage DC systems with the 4210 and 4212; these panels were not a success. Most of Simplex's audible notification appliances prior to the 1990s were relabeled Benjamin Electric, Federal Signal, Faraday, and Autocall devices, such as the 2901-9806 (Federal Signal 450) 2901-9833 (Faraday 6020), and the 4050 (Faraday 5410). Simplex's time division began to lose market share, but their newly founded fire alarm division significantly prospered. In 1970, Simplex introduced the 4208-series conventional control panels. The 4050-80 light plate series with added AC powered 4050 (Faraday 5410) horn or DC powered 4051 (Faraday 5640) horn were introduced as the signals for the 4208. Around this time, Simplex also introduced the iconic \"T-bar\" style pull station, which is still manufactured today. In 1975, Simplex introduced the 4207, a system similar in design to the 4208, but with updated features such as card-based modularity, DC battery trickle charging, compatibility with custom COP and read-back systems for pre-multiplex building control, and voice evacuation for large buildings.\n\nIn 1979, Simplex introduced the LifeAlarm 2100, the industry's first networked multiplex building control system that was capable of handling fire alarm, security, HVAC, synchronized time, and watchman's tour. It centered on a large CPU console with built-in CRT display and keyboard that controlled the system's remote transponders (smaller self-sufficient panels connected to the DC Communications loop that distributed the system's I/O). In 1981, the 2100 was replaced with the popular and less-expensive 2120-series. Unlike the 2100, the 2120's main CPU came in the form of a traditional wall-mount panel that was field-programmable, but several more options for remotely controlling the system through external CRT consoles and status command centers were now made available. The main panel featured a vacuum fluorescent display screen, DOS-based EEPROM programming, built-in printer, and a voice evacuation option. The 2120 was finally discontinued in 1992. These systems were possibly the first fire alarm systems with a screen display. Though flexible and robust, these systems were often criticized for being difficult to operate and troubleshoot. These two computer-based systems were accompanied by the conventional 2001-series. First released in 1978, the 2001 was a highly customizable system that used plug-in modules. Some were common to every system (basic controls), while many other options were available, including signal coding cards, waterflow monitor cards, and many others. These cards were also compatible with Simplex's multiplex systems. In 1980, Simplex introduced the Simplex 2903 series. This includes the 2903 light plates and the 2904 series remote lights, along with xenon strobe versions. They also introduced their 2901-9833 and 2901-9806 horns in 1977. In 1988, the 2001 was discontinued in favor of the 4001 and 4002 series (which came out in 1985 and 1986, respectively), and the 1000-point 4100 addressable system which was introduced that year, along with the 4903 series light/strobe plates, which ultimately replaced the 2903/2904 series. Around 1992, the 2120 was replaced with the 4120-series networked panel, and the 508-point 4020 addressable system was introduced at the same time, with the new 2099/4099 series T-Bar pull stations. In 1993, Simplex began manufacturing their 4903 mechanical horn strobe series, along with the 4904 strobes and 4901 horns. In 1994, Simplex introduced the 4004 and 4005 conventional panels, along with the 4009 NAC extender. In 1998, the 4903 electronic horn strobe was released, and in 2001, Simplex introduced the TrueAlert-series, cited as being the industry's first addressable notification appliances which can be tested individually with a magnet without activating the entire system. The 4100U, a consolidated upgrade of Simplex's three largest addressable systems, followed in 2001, and was again updated in 2010 with the current 4100ES. \n\nToday, SimplexGrinnell markets a full product line of conventional and addressable fire alarm and emergency notification systems, including:\n\nSimplex fire alarm systems are compatible with TrueAlert and TrueAlert ES-series notification appliances, TrueAlarm smoke detectors, 4009-series IDNet NAC extenders, the 4003EC voice/alarm communications panel, and a variety of accessories.\n\n\n\nSimplexGrinnell also markets burglar alarms, PA systems, and nurse call systems. They also provide testing, inspection, and maintenance services for fire alarm, sprinkler, suppression, security, and communication equipment. To a much lesser degree, the company also sells and services pull stations, time clocks, and master time systems And Mass Notification Systems.\n\n\n\n"}

The United Kingdom version contained no singles, but the American and Canadian versions included the single \"Are You Receiving Me?\" (released 27 October 1978). A promotional video was also made for the song.\n\nBy August 1978, XTC were prepared to record their follow-up to \"White Music\". The band had contacted Brian Eno to produce after they learned that he was a fan, but he declined, telling them that they were good enough to produce themselves. Virgin rejected Eno's advice, and the group instead returned to Abbey Road with producer John Leckie. One of the album's tracks, \"Battery Brides (Andy Paints Brian)\", was written in tribute to Eno.\n\nKeyboardist Barry Andrews appeared at the sessions with several original songs, but frontman Andy Partridge did not feel they were right for the band. He began taking bassist Colin Moulding and drummer Terry Chambers out for drinks without inviting Partridge, allegedly in an attempt to take over the group. After most of Andrews' songs were dropped from the final track list, the keyboardist told journalists that he foresaw the band \"explod[ing] pretty soon\". \n\nAn earlier version of \"Are You Receiving Me?\" was recorded during the \"Go 2\" sessions and was later released on the 2005 boxed set \"Coat of Many Cupboards\". Other outtakes from \"Go 2\" include \"Sargasso Bar\", \"Us Being Us\", \"Instant Tunes\", \"Looking for Footprints\", \"Things Fall to Bits\" and \"Strange Tales, Strange Tails\".\n\nThe album's title was chosen in reference to the board game Go in order to continue the black-and-white colour scheme from \"White Music\". The \"2\" was added by Andrews. Its cover was designed and executed by Hipgnosis. It consists of an essay about how album covers are used to attract buyers of the album. On the first British pressings of the LP version of the \"Go 2\" album the track listing on the vinyl disc label mimicked the type style of the cover art. The label is crammed full of text. In some non-English speaking countries, the group shot that was featured on the album's inner sleeve in the UK was used instead as the album cover. The French 13-track album, including the bonus track \"Are You Receiving Me?\", was one of the releases that featured this sleeve. Yugoslavia was another country that issued this version of the sleeve.\n\nThe essay would change depending on the medium (Vinyl or CD) and label (Virgin, Epic or Geffen) the album was released on. A separate essay was prepared for cassette editions in the UK.\n\n\"Go 2\" was released in October 1978 to positive reviews and a number 21 chart peak. Like \"White Music\", it was given praise in \"Sounds\", \"Melody Maker\", and the \"NME\". The initial 15,000 UK pressings of the album came with a bonus disc of five dub remixes entitled \"Go+\". In 1990, these tracks were included on the 1990 compilation \"\".\n\nXTC\n\nAdditional personnel\n"}

He is best known under his ring name Latin Lover, under which he is also credited in his acting career. Resendiz is best known for wrestling in the Mexican AAA promotion, but has also worked for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and currently works for the Perros del Mal and Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) promotions under the ring name Latino. Resendiz and his partner Mariana Vallejo Isrrade won the very first Bailando por un Sueño dance competition in 2005.\n\nVictor Manuel Resendiz Ruiz made his professional wrestling debut in 1992 at \"Arena Solidaridad\" in his home town of Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico, facing the team of Comando Ruso, Hijo del Solitario and Canadian Butcher. Resendiz debuted under the ring name \"Latin Lover\", a name he has used ever since. Originally Latin Lover was an \"enmascarado\", or masked character, but he lost the match in a \"Luchas de Apuesta\" (bet match) against the team of Sangre Chicana and El Sanguinario on August 1, 1992. Lover and Espacial were close to win against the rudos as they made Chicana submit, but El Sanguinario was able to defeat both of them to score an upset win. After the loss of the mask Latin Lover worked briefly for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) and on various shows on the Mexican independent circuit. In 1994 he signed a contract to join Asistencia Asesoría y Administración, later simply AAA and soon became a featured wrestler on the mid-card. Latin Lover was quickly teamed up with another charismatic young wrestler by the name of Heavy Metal and together they won the Mexican National Tag Team Championship from \"Los Destructores\" (Tony Arce and Volcano) on September 9, 1994. The team held the title for 82 days before losing it to Fuerza Guerrera and Juventud Guerrera on December 2, 1994. After failing to regain the titles Latin Lover began teaming with Panterita del Ring instead, defeating Los Guerreras for the tag team title on June 1, 1995. Lover and Panterita successfully defended the title against Los Guerreras and Blue Panther and Heavy Metal before losing the titles back to Los Guerreras on September 18, 1995. While Latin Lover had a limited repertoire when it came to wrestling, his good looks and dance moves made him a favorite with the fans, especially the women in the audience, keeping him high in the AAA rankings. On September 9, 1996 Latin Lover won the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship by defeating Pimpinela Escarlata. On February 15, 1997 Latin Lover defeated Pierroth, Jr. to become a double champion as he won the AAA Campeón de Campeones Championship. On February 21, 1997 Latin Lover defeated Máscara Sagráda, Jr., Jerry Estrada and Killer to earn a spot in the finals of the 1997 Rey de Reyes tournament. Lover went on to defeat Heavy Metal, Héctor Garza and Octagón to win the tournament and become the 1997 \"Rey de Reyes\" (Spanish for \"King of Kings\") On May 12, 1997 Cibernético defeated him to win the Campeon de Campeones title. Three days later Latin Lover also lost the Mexican Light Heavyweight title after 252 days with the title. In late 1999 Latin Lover would win both the Mexican National Heavyweight Championship and regain the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship, becoming a double champion once again. He only held the Light Heavyweight title for 105 days before losing it to Sangre Chicana on February 1, 2000. Due to nagging knee injuries Latin Lover's schedule in 2000 and 2001 slowed down to only select appearances. On May 5, 2002 – 929 days after winning the title Latin Lover finally lost the Mexican National Heavyweight Championship to Héctor Garza. On March 21, 2003, he received a match against NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett but lost to him in Mexico City. The match came about as a result of a working relationship between AAA and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) and Latin Lover was chosen to represent AAA on the card.\n\nIn 2005 Resendiz, officially billed as Latin Lover on the show, competed in and won the inaugural Bailando por un Sueño dance tournament with his partner Mariana Vallejo Isrrade. The win led to Latin Lover becoming a household name in Mexico, leading to more acting parts both on television and on stage. Resendiz appeared in the \"telenovela\" \"Velo de Novia\" (\"The Bridal Veil\") and on stage and TV as part of the \"Sólo para Mujeres\" (\"For Women Only\") dance/stripping group. During a stage performance Resendiz performed a dive off the stage and injured his knee, tearing the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his knee. On January 26, 2006 Resendiz announced that he had to retire from wrestling due to this injury and that he was scheduled for what would be the eighth knee surgery since his debut in 1992. In 2010 Latin Lover was selected to represent Mexico as one of the Juries on Second Dance World Championship. Resendiz appeared in the telenovela \"Qué bonito amor\" and \"La tempestad\".\n\nIn late 2008 Latin Lover returned to wrestling, initially teasing that he would join the CMLL based group \"Los Perros del Mal\", but in the end returned to AAA. At the Rey de Reyes (2009) tournament on March 15, 2009 he defeated Abismo Negro, Black Abyss and Dark Ozz to qualify for the final. In the final he was the last wrestler eliminated by the 2009 \"Rey de Reyes\" Electroshock. Following the \"Rey de Reyes\" tournament Latin Lover began teaming with Marco Corleone, a wrestler with a similar \"Ladies man\" character. The team challenged AAA World Tag Team Champions \"La Hermandad Extrema\" (Spanish for \"The Extreme Brotherhood\"; Nicho el Milinario and Joe Lider) in one of the featured events at Triplemania XVII, only to lose due to miscommunication between Latin Lover and Corleone. On March 18, 2010, AAA announced in a press conference that they would no longer be booking Latin Lover, due to monetary issues and him no-showing the 2010 \"Rey de Reyes\" event where he was scheduled to be part of the main event. On April 11 Perros del Mal announced that Latin Lover would be joining the promotion and debuting the following month. On June 4, 2010, Latin Lover returned to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre, brawling with Héctor Garza. After not appearing again for CMLL for months, Latin Lover returned to the promotion on November 26, 2010, confronting \"Los Invasores\", a \"rudo\" group led by Garza. He was then attacked by the group, before being saved by Shocker. Upon returning to the promotion, Resendiz adopted the new ring name of Latino.\n\nIn early April, 2010 ex-AAA wrestlers Histeria and El Alebrije sought legal action against AAA over the issues of name and ring character ownership as well as unfair termination by AAA. The two claim that they have wrestled for 13 years to create the characters and thus own them. The parties met in Mexico City’s Board of Conciliation and Arbitration to see if a settlement can be reached or if the matter will be taken to court. The parties met for a second arbitration meeting in late April, 2010. This time the plaintiff group was joined by Latin Lover who, like Alebrije, Histeria and the others, claimed that he should be allowed to use the ring name on the independent circuit since he's worked as Latin Lover for 18 years and thus should be allowed to continue using it. After the meeting it was stated that all parties involved were cooperating over the matter.\n\n"}

After a certain degree of blood loss has occurred, the animal will become unconscious, and after a greater blood loss death will ensue. From the moment of cutting until the loss of consciousness, the animal can experience pain, stress and fear. Without stunning, the time between cutting through the major blood vessels and insensibility, as deduced from behavioural and brain response, is up to 20 seconds in sheep, up to 25 seconds in pigs, up to 2 minutes in cattle, up to 2.5 or more minutes in poultry, and sometimes 15 minutes or more in fish.\n\nA primitive form of stunning was used in premodern times in the case of cattle, which were poleaxed prior to being bled out. However, prior to slaughter pistols and electric stunners, pigs, sheep and other animals (including cattle) were simply struck while fully conscious.\n\nThe belief that this was unnecessarily cruel and painful to the animal being slaughtered eventually led to the compulsory adoption of stunning methods in many countries. One of the first campaigners on the matter was the eminent physician, Benjamin Ward Richardson, who spent many years of his later working life developing more ‘humane’ methods of slaughter. As early as 1853, he designed a lethal chamber that would gas animals to death supposedly painlessly, and he founded the Model Abattoir Society in 1882 to investigate and campaign for other methods of slaughter. He even experimented with the use of electric current at the Royal Polytechnic Institution.\nThe development of stunning technologies occurred largely in the first half of the twentieth century. In 1911, the Council of Justice to Animals (later the Humane Slaughter Association) was created to improve the slaughter of livestock and address the killing of unwanted pets. In the early 1920s, the HSA introduced and demonstrated a mechanical stunner, which led to the adoption of stunning by many local authorities.\"\n\nThe HSA played a key role in the passage of the Slaughter of Animals Act 1933. This made the mechanical stunning of cows and electrical stunning of pigs compulsory, with the exception of Jewish and Muslim meat. Modern methods, such as the captive bolt pistol and electric tongs were required and the Act's wording specifically outlawed the poleaxe. The period was marked by the development of various innovations in slaughterhouse technologies, not all of them particularly long-lasting.\n\nIn modern slaughterhouses a variety of stunning methods are used on livestock. Methods include:\n\nElectrical stunning is done by sending an electric current through the brain and/or heart of the animal before slaughter. Current passing through the brain induces an immediate but non-fatal general convulsion that produces unconsciousness. Current passing through the heart produces an immediate cardiac arrest that also leads shortly to unconsciousness and death. It is a controversial subject however. With chickens for example, over stunning leads to bone fractures and/or electrocution which prevents bleeding of the animal. This negatively affects the quality of the meat, and therefore under stunning is an attractive practice for slaughterhouses.\n\nIn the Netherlands, for example, the law states that poultry must be stunned for 4 seconds minimum with an average current of 100mA, which leads to systematic under stunning.\n\nThe CrustaStun is a device designed to administer a lethal electric shock to shellfish (such as lobsters, crabs, and crayfish) before cooking. This avoids boiling a live shellfish which may be able to experience pain in a way similar to vertebrates. The device works by applying a 110 volt, 2–5 amp electrical charge to the animal. It is reported the CrustaStun renders the shellfish unconscious in 0.3 seconds and kills the animal in 5 to 10 seconds, compared to 3 minutes to kill a lobster by boiling or 4.5 minutes for a crab.\n\nWith gas stunning animals are exposed to a mixture of breathing gases (argon and nitrogen for example) that produce unconsciousness or death through hypoxia or asphyxia. The process is not instantaneous.\n\nWith percussive stunning, a device which hits the animal on the head, with or without penetration, is employed. Such devices, such as the captive bolt pistol, can be either pneumatic, or powder-actuated. Percussive stunning produces immediate unconsciousness through brain trauma.\n\nStunning is regulated by the provisions of the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act (7 U.S.C. 1901), which the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is mandated to uphold under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 603 (b)). No similar provision exists in the Poultry Products Inspection Act of 1957 (21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.).\n\nAfter confirmation of the first U.S. BSE case, FSIS issued regulations (69 FR 1887, January 12, 2004) prohibiting the use of the most widely used stunning device (air-injection captive bolt stun gun) because the compressed air device (in contrast to the blank cartridge-driven or non-penetrating captive bolt) has been shown to force pieces of brain and other central nervous system (CNS) tissue into the bloodstream. Cattle blood is processed primarily for use as a protein supplement in animal feeds and milk replacer for calves, and could transmit BSE if it contained specified risk materials (SRMs include brain and CNS tissue).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2316030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316030", "title": "Kingdom of Gomma", "text": "Kingdom of Gomma\n\nThe Kingdom of Gomma was one of the kingdoms in the Gibe region of Ethiopia that emerged in the 18th century. It was based in Agaro.\n\nGomma shared its northern border with Limmu-Ennarea, its western border with Gumma, its southern border with Gera, and its eastern border with Jimma. Its capital was Agaro.\n\nThis former kingdom was mostly located in an undulating valley, with a population estimated in 1880 of about 15,000-16,000; its extent is roughly the same as the modern woreda of Gomma. Beckingham and Huntingford considered Gomma, along with Gumma, was the least economically developed of the Gibe kingdoms; however Mohammed Hassen writes that \"the people of Gomma devoted themselves to farming, earning a reputation for a high degree of civilization.\n\nAlso located in the kingdom of Gomma were two hills, Sinka and Bemba (the last was also called Kella Egdu Biya, or \"Gate of the Watching of the Land\"), which were sacred to the pagan Oromo. They were inhabited by prophets who lived with large snakes; descendants of these snakes are offered beer and goats' blood by Oromos to allieve their illnesses.\n\nMohammed Hassen notes that \"the written information on the early history of Gomma is limited, and confused.\" Beckingham and Huntingford trace the foundation of Gomma to a miracle-worker who was named Nur Husain or Wariko, said to have come from Mogadishu. Although they speculate that this semi-legendary figure might have been confused with the better-known Sheikh Husein, whose tomb is located near the Shebelle River, they note that Antonio Cecchi reports that Wariko's tomb is located on the banks of the Didessa River, and was an object of veneration.\n\nHassen explains the tradition around Nur Husain as reflecting the fact that \"Gomma was the first state in the Gibe region where Islam became the religion of the whole people.\" Trimingham states that Gomma was the first of the Gibe kingdoms to convert to Islam, quoting Major G.W. Harris as writing that by 1841 \"in Goma the Moslem faith is universal.\"\n\nHassen states that the first King of Gomma was Abba Boke, although Beckingham and Huntingford state his son, Abba Manno, had this honor. Abba Boke had gained control over all of Gomma, between Yacci and Dogaye, except for a region named Qattu. Abba Manno was later able to annex Qattu during his reign (c. 1820 - 1840), and promoted Islam by patronizing Muslim religious teachers, as well as enhancing the activities of the Qadiriya order.\n\nIn 1886, Gomma was conquered by Besha Abue on behalf of Emperor Menelik II.\n\n"}

{"id": "2316032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316032", "title": "Combat information center", "text": "Combat information center\n\nA combat information center (CIC) or action information centre (AIC) is a room in a warship or AWACS aircraft that functions as a tactical center and provides processed information for command and control of the near battlespace or area of operations. Within other military commands, rooms serving similar functions are known as command centers. \n\nRegardless of the vessel or command locus, each CIC organizes and processes information into a form more convenient and usable by the commander in authority. Each CIC funnels communications and data received over multiple channels, which is then organized, evaluated, weighted and arranged to provide ordered timely information flow to the battle command staff under the control of the CIC officer and his deputies.\n\nCICs are widely depicted in film and television treatments, frequently with large maps, numerous computer consoles and radar and sonar repeater displays or consoles, as well as the almost ubiquitous grease-pencil annotated polar plot on an edge-lighted transparent plotting board. At the time the CIC concept was born, the projected map-like polar display (PPI scopes) with the ship at the center was making its way into radar displays displacing the A-scope which was simply a time-delayed blip showing a range on an oscilloscope Cathode ray tube.\n\nSuch polar plots are used routinely in navigation and military action management to display time-stamped range and bearing information to the CIC decision makers. A single 'mark' (\"range and bearing\" datum) bears little actionable decision-making information by itself. A succession of such data tells much more, including whether the contact is closing or opening in range, an idea of its speed and direction (these are calculable, even from bearings-only data, given sufficient observations and knowledge of tactics), the relation to other contacts and their ranges and behaviors. Harvesting such data sets from the polar plots and computers (Common to sonar, radar and lidar) allows the CIC crew to plot the data correctly on a chart or map at the correct range and bearing, and to calculate the course and speed of the contact accurately, giving the set a vast expansion to include future positions, given unchanged relative courses and relative speeds. \nA CIC in a naval context brings together and manages information on the warship's status and its surroundings, and supplies this to the commanding officer, who would generally be present on the nearby bridge or where plots can be viewed and, if one is aboard, a flag officer who might have their own separate flag bridge and fleet CIC. CICs or operations centers in other command contexts have the same function: information ordering, gathering, and presentation to the decision makers whether it is to a prime minister, general, or local police chief. The types and controls over the collection of information, the communications systems may vary, but the task or mission of providing clarification of the situation and options to the commander remain the same whether the CIC is located on a submarine, surface ship, or airplane.\n\nSome control, assistance, and coordination functions may be delegated to the CIC staff or directly to the CIC officer, such as overseeing the mode and prioritization of sensor resources such as radar monitoring, targeting, or sonar activities; communications to external sources and assets.\n\nOn US aircraft carriers this area is called the combat direction center (CDC). The United States developed their Command Information Center concept circa the winter of 1942–1943 and implemented it in a surge of refitting and retraining during 1943 after post-battle action analyses of battles in 1942 from the battle of the Coral Sea through the losses at Ironbottom Sound during the protracted Solomon Islands campaign.\n\nIn British usage this area may be known as an aircraft direction room; together with the operations room they form an \"operations headquarters\". The British aircraft direction room evolved from the fighter direction office, a primitive means of controlling an aircraft carrier's aircraft through radio and radar. In September, 1942, HMS \"Victorious\" underwent a refit that included installation of an aircraft direction room.\n\nThe idea of such a centralised control room can be found in science fiction as early as \"The Struggle for Empire\" (1900). Early versions were used in the Second World War; according to Rear Admiral Cal Laning, the idea for a command information center was taken “specifically, consciously, and directly” from the spaceship \"Directrix\" in the Lensman novels of E. E. Smith, Ph.D., and influenced by the works of his friend and collaborator Robert Heinlein, a retired American naval officer. After the numerous losses during the various naval battles off Guadalcanal during the war of attrition that was part and parcel of the Solomon Islands campaign and the Battle of Guadalcanal, the United States Navy employed operational analysis, determined many of their losses were due to procedure and disorganization, and implemented the Combat Information Centers, building on what was initially called \"radar plot\" according to an essay \"CIC Yesterday and Today\" by the Naval Historical Center. That same article points out that in 1942 radar, radar procedure, battle experiences, needs, and the operations room all grew up together as needs developed and experience was gained and training spread, all in fits and starts, beginning with the earliest radar uses in the Pacific battles starting with the Coral Sea, when radar gave rise to the first tentative attempt to vector an Air CAP to approaching Japanese flights, maturing some before the Battle of Midway, where post-battle analysis of Coral Sea's results had given more confidence in the ability and to the process and the desire was bolstered by new procedures giving their measure of added confidence. \n\nThe Naval History & Heritage Command essay notes that growing the responsibility of the nascent CIC organization necessarily upset the old order of doing, who was reporting to whom, and most of all, of communications protocols where now CICs within a task group were, when possible, joined in permanent communication links to even the lowliest destroyer escort or fleet auxiliary, adding the eyes and reports of their lookouts to those of similar watch-standers about the fleet as a whole. In short the CICs continually grew for a time, superseding old organizational structure and supplanting them with a new system filtering and shaping information to a newly empowered command group. The tasks and facilities put at the service of the CICs also grew within a ship. While in 1943 a destroyer CIC might just have been configured for anti-ship and anti-submarine warfare tasks, by the Battle of the Philippine Sea when set out as radar pickets had to undertake forward air controller (FAC) functions and somehow jam in air search radar and anti-air action control functions.\n\nFrom that beginning, were added the corporate experiences of the continuing series of naval air and naval surface actions around and about the Battle of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands campaign. By late 1943 when the first new construction carriers of the \"Essex\"-class fleet carriers and the \"Independence\"-class light carriers with many associated fleet vessels had reinforced the refitted USS \"Enterprise\" (CV-6) and the USS \"Saratoga\" (CV-3), the U.S. Navy was prepared to take the offensive and began evolving CIC procedures and operational doctrine for a fleet of carriers. \n\nThere has been an evolution of electronics (computer) equipment and user interfaces used in such installations over time. Modern CIC equipment is built up from many connected embedded systems.\n\n\n\n"}

Over 11 million guests visited the park in its opening year, making it the world's fastest amusement park to have achieved the 10 million milestone at the time. Since then, Universal Studios Japan has had approximately 8 million visitors every year. Most visitors are Japanese tourists and tourists from other Asian countries such as South Korea and China. It is also very popular among Western tourists and expatriates. In 2005, Goldman Sachs became the largest shareholder in Universal Studios Japan.\n\nVarious events were held in the year 2011 to celebrate the park's tenth anniversary, by which time a total of 88 million guests had cumulatively attended the park. There were 700,000 annual passport holders in June 2012 and in the 2012 fiscal year, 9.75 million guests visited the park. During the 2013 fiscal year, Universal Studios Japan received 10.5 million guests. Various factors contributed to this growth in 2013, including the opening of the backwards roller coaster \"Hollywood Dream – The Ride – Backdrop\" in March, and the \"New Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man - The Ride 4K3D\" in July, which installed new 4KHD technology, which proved to be popular among the younger generation of visitors.

{"id": "2316045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316045", "title": "Omphalos (book)", "text": "Omphalos (book)\n\nOmphalos: An Attempt to Untie the Geological Knot is a book by Philip Gosse, written in 1857 (two years before Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\"), in which he argues that the fossil record is not evidence of evolution, but rather that it is an act of creation inevitably made so that the world would appear to be older than it is. The reasoning parallels the reasoning that Gosse chose to explain why Adam (who would have had no mother) had a navel: Though Adam would have had no need of a navel, God gave him one anyway to give him the appearance of having a human ancestry. Thus, the name of the book, \"Omphalos\", which means 'navel' in Greek.\n\nDarwin is mentioned several times within the book, but always with considerable respect. Gosse had attended meetings at the Royal Society where evolutionary theory was tested by Darwin before the publication of \"Origin\"—and had even made similar observations himself about variation of species in his own studies into marine biology—and considered Darwin's reasoning scientifically sound.\n\nThe book was precised by his son Edmund Gosse:\n\nThe book was widely rejected at the time, sold few copies, and had almost no supporters. Though the publisher was able to use in advertising an extract from the Natural History Review: \"We have no hesitation in pronouncing this book to be the most important and best-written that has yet appeared on the very interesting question with which it deals. We believe the logic of the book to be unanswerable, its laws fully deduced\", the rest of the sentence in the review reads \"and the whole, considered as a play of metaphysical subtlety, absolutely complete; and yet we venture to predict that its conclusions will not be accepted as probable by one in ten thousand readers.\" The reviewer concluded that \"Omphalos\" contained \"idle speculations, fit only to please a philosopher in his hours of relaxation, but hardly worthy of the serious attention of any man, whether scientific or not\". The geologist Joseph Beete Jukes was more scathing in a later issue: \"To a man of a really serious and religious turn of mind, this treatment is far more repulsive than that even of the author of Vestiges of Creation. and the Lamarckian School\".\n\nThe Rev. Charles Kingsley, author of \"The Water-Babies\" and a friend of Gosse, was asked to review Gosse's book. Refusing, he wrote to Gosse:\n\nFor a long time, apart from the discussion in his biography of his father, the only widely read though oblique references to the book were to be found in \"Father and Son\", the psychological portrait of Philip Gosse by his son Edmund Gosse published in 1907. He wrote:\n\nMartin Gardner, in his 1952 book \"Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science\", observed: \"Not the least of its remarkable virtues is that although it won not a single convert, it presented a theory so logically perfect, and so in accord with geological facts that no amount of scientific evidence will ever be able to refute it ... Not a single truth of geology need be abandoned, yet\nthe harmony with Genesis is complete\"\n\nThis internal consistency was also discussed by the American biologist Stephen Jay Gould in a 1987 article entitled \"Adam's Navel\", which has since been republished as a mini book. He comments:\n\nIt had earlier been referred to in a short work by Jorge Luis Borges.\n\nRoizen has suggested that \"perhaps the rejection of Omphalos is a measure of how much—even before the publication of Darwin's earthshaking book—the theological system of assumptions had already waned.\" In the 1820s and 30s the scriptural geologists had fought a battle against the rise of uniformitarianism and indeed Gosse suggests in his preface that Granville Penn had captured the essence of his argument 30 years previously.\n\nThe theory presented in the book is now called the omphalos hypothesis: that the world and everything in it could have been created at any time, even mere moments ago, with even our own memories being false indications of its age. This is a largely philosophical position, not a scientific one.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2316047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316047", "title": "Norwegian Current", "text": "Norwegian Current\n\nThe Norwegian Current (also known as the Norwegian Coastal Current) is a water current that flows northeasterly along the Atlantic coast of Norway at depths of between 50 and 100 metres through the Barents Sea Opening into the Barents Sea. It contrasts with the North Atlantic Current because it is colder and contains less salt, having most of its tributary water coming from the slightly brackish North and Baltic seas, as well as the Norwegian fjords and rivers. It is, however, considerably warmer and saltier than the Arctic Ocean, which is freshened by the ice in and around it. Winter temperatures in the Norwegian current are typically between 2 and 5 °C whereas the temperature of the Atlantic water exceeds 6 °C.\n\nNorwegian coastal waters are dominated by two main water masses, the Norwegian Coastal Current and the North Atlantic Drift Water (Atlantic Water). As the Norwegian Coastal Current moves northward, North Atlantic Drift Water is mixed in, raising the salinity (see Salinity below).\n\nThe current is both wind-driven, “piling up” of water along the Norwegian coast by southwesterly winds (creating elevation and thus pressure differences), and also driven by its salinity distribution which in turn creates density gradients .\n\nIt is composed primarily of outflow from the Baltic Sea (50% of freshwater input), flowing through the Skagerrak strait into the North Sea (10% freshwater input) circulation, joining with a fraction of the North Atlantic Drift (an extension of the Gulf Stream). The North Sea forms the third largest input of brackish-fresh water preceded by the inputs of fjords and rivers of Norway (40% of freshwater input). The Skagerrak area receives about 2100 m/s of freshwater inflow, 75% of which is Baltic outflow, 15% is North Sea outflow and 10% is runoff from Norway and Sweden It is sometimes considered to be a continuation of the Baltic Current and is a major source of freshwater for the Barents Sea and Arctic Sea. It is formed by the branch of Atlantic current that flows into the North Sea and circulates through the North Sea basin along the Norwegian Trench picking up fresh and brackish water. It is a surface current and flows along the top 50–100 m of the sea surface.\n\nAs the Norwegian Coastal Current moves northward, North Atlantic Drift Water is mixed in, raising the salinity (see Salinity below).\n\nThe Norwegian Coastal Current is a wedge-shaped current that has varying salinity and temperature characteristics, and thus densities. The volume of freshwater inputs is greatest in the summer months and smaller during the winter months, contributing to the variability in salinity. On average, it has a salinity of about 34.5 psu (ppt); the near coastal waters have a slightly lower salinity (32-31 psu), the current’s boundary to the North Atlantic Drift is marked by a slightly higher salinity, 35 ppt.\n\nThe average winter temperature of the Norwegian Coastal Current is about 3.5 °C and ranges from 2 to 5 °C, while in summer the temperature of the current is warmer as the tributary sources (Baltic sea, Norwegian fjords, rivers) are warmed up.\n\nAlthough there is much variability in the current’s velocities, ranging from as little as 20 cm/s to 100 cm/s at its maximum it is characterized by a velocity of 30 cm/s.\n\nA mechanism of exchange of energy between the atmosphere and the surface waters of the Atlantic Ocean, Norwegian Coastal Current, is very important to the climate of Norway.\n\nIn the winter time, there is a release of heat from the ocean to the overlying air masses. These air masses generally flow in the direction of north-east, thereby warming the adjacent land masses (Norway); especially the coastal regions.\n\nIn the summer, the effect is actually reversed. Warm air masses (heated by the Sun on long days) above the Atlantic Ocean will transfer heat to the underlying cooler ocean. This results in cooler air masses reaching the Scandinavian Peninsula, thereby cooling it down in the summer months, especially the coastal regions.\n\nHence, the Atlantic Ocean and the nearby coastal waters have a moderating effect on the extremes of temperature in Norway, making (especially the coastal regions) warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer. The same effect is very pronounced at Iceland.\n\nTo a slight extent, the Norwegian Coastal Current is conveying warmer water into the Barents Sea, decreasing the amount of ice that will form there. In this perspective, the effect of the North Atlantic Drift is much larger.\n\nThe current brings nutrient rich water along the coast of Norway, and with it rich fisheries of cod, herring, and capelin. Wind driven upwelling along the Strait of Skagerrak brings abundant nutrients to the surface which are then carried along the coastline. Norway has one of the biggest fishing industries in the world, harvesting an average of 3 million metric tons of fish each year. The Norwegian coast is also an important spawning ground for many of the commercial fishes.\n\nThe 1990s were an exceptional decade for interannual climate variations in Norway. \n\nThe temperatures were, on average, warmer, producing wet, warm winters and hot summers in Norway. This has led to increased precipitation extremes, and changes in fish stocks.\n\nIncreased atmospheric temperatures due to global climate change cause strong south westerly winds to pile water up along the Norwegian coast. The pressure difference creates storm surges that have increased coastal flooding in recent years.\n\nTemperatures have also been rising in the deep layers of Norwegian coastal waters. \n\nIncreasing temperatures cause a decrease in sea ice that is supplying the Norwegian Sea with greater amounts of freshwater and lowering the salinities overall. \n\nThis decrease in salinity could cause changes in the rate at which (Arctic) bottom water form (through the process of sea ice formation and the sinking of the highly saline by-product excluded when sea ice forms). If the rate of the formation of (Arctic) bottom water is slowed, then the entire inward flow of the North Atlantic Drift to the Arctic Ocean may be slowed down. \n\nAdditionally, increased warming of the North Atlantic Drift is a much larger contributor to the inhibition of formation of sea ice in the Arctic, than the contribution from the Norwegian Coastal Current. Hence, the impact of the Norwegian Coastal Current on climate change is relatively small.\n\n\n"}

It is sung by Ringo Starr, the only Beatle to appear on the track. The music was provided by an orchestra arranged and conducted by George Martin. It is the last song on their 1968 double album \"The Beatles\" (also known as the \"White Album\").\n\nJohn Lennon wrote the song as a lullaby for his five-year-old son Julian. \n\nThe original version of \"Good Night\" featured George Harrison and John Lennon playing the melody on guitars with them and Paul McCartney singing the harmony and Ringo taking the lead vocal. Take 10 with a guitar part from take 5 was released on the 2018 50th Anniversary Box Set of \"The Beatles\". A fragment of a rehearsal and take 22 of the song, along with an overdub of the orchestra from the close of the released version is heard on the 1996 Beatles compilation album, \"Anthology 3\".\nGeorge Martin's arrangement is lush, and intentionally so. Lennon is said to have wanted the song to sound \"real cheesy\", like a Gordon Jenkins-esque Old Hollywood production number. The orchestra consisted of 12 violins, three violas, three cellos, one harp, three flutes, one clarinet, one horn, one vibraphone, and one string bass, played by 26 musicians. The Mike Sammes Singers also took part in the recording, providing backing vocals.\n\nStarr became the third member of the group (after Paul McCartney and George Harrison) to record a song credited to the group without the other members performing (Lennon was the fourth with \"Julia\"). The song ends with Starr whispering the words: \"Good night... Good night, everybody... Everybody, everywhere... Good night.\"\n\nThe song makes three appearances on the Beatles' soundtrack to the Cirque du Soleil production of \"Love\". It is used as a transition between \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" and \"Octopus's Garden\". It can be heard a minor third lower than originally recorded. After the orchestral intro to the third verse of \"Good Night\", the same orchestral accompaniment is played over a sample of Starr freely, slowly singing the opening words to \"Octopus's Garden\". Later, at the end of the show, after the strains of \"All You Need Is Love\" have faded out, the orchestral coda of \"Good Night\", in its original key, G major (as well as the last bits of dialogue in the Beatles' fan club-exclusive Christmas album) brings the album to a close.\n\nCoinciding with the 50th anniversary of its release, Jacob Stolworthy of \"The Independent\" listed \"Good Night\" at number 28 in his ranking of the White Album's 30 tracks. He called the track, \"a mediocre song sung by Ringo.\" He continued \"Despite a vibrant orchestral arrangement from George Martin, \"Good Night\"like all lullabiesmight put you to sleep.\"\n\nThe song has been covered by several artists, including the Carpenters, Kenny Loggins (feat. Alison Krauss), Linda Ronstadt, and the Manhattan Transfer. Barbra Streisand recorded it in 1969 for her album \"What About Today?\".\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1888 by Lucy Wheelock as Miss Wheelock's Kindergarten Training School, it offered undergraduate and graduate programs that focused on the Arts & Sciences, Education and Child Life, and Social Work and Family Studies to improve the lives of children and families. The college's academic programs merged with Boston University School of Education on June 1, 2018 and were incorporated as Boston University Wheelock College of Education & Human Development. The physical campus of Wheelock College is now named the Boston University Fenway Campus, which includes a dining hall, student housing, and the Wheelock Family Theatre.\n\nWheelock was a member of the Colleges of the Fenway and the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts (AICUM) and accredited by:\n\nThe Wheelock Wildcats competed in the NCAA Division III in the New England Collegiate Conference. The college offered five varsity men's teams and six varsity women's teams, as well as intramural teams through the Colleges of the Fenway. In addition to athletics, Wheelock College offered many clubs and organizations that allow students to become involved on campus and in the community.\n\n\n\nThe principal undergraduate academic units of Wheelock College were the Professional majors and the Arts and Sciences majors.\nWheelock offered one master's degree program online:\n\nWheelock offered bachelor's and master's programs abroad.\n\nEntering first-year students were automatically eligible for admission into the Honors Program if they had a high school GPA of 3.5 or higher \"and\" an SAT score (combined Critical Reading and Math Sections) of at least 1100. All accepted students who meet these requirements received an invitation to join the program. Honors students must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.30 to remain in the Honors Program. Wheelock had a chapter of Pi Gamma Mu, the international honor society.\n\n\n\n\nThe President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll recognized institutions of higher education that supported exemplary community service programs and raise the visibility of effective practices in campus community partnerships. In 2014, Wheelock was recognized with distinction for their strides in the General Community Service category. The College chose to highlight three aspects of its curricula in the application: its partnership with the Mattahunt Community Center in Mattapan, MA; the Presidential International Service Learning Program; and the Ubuntu Arts Project, which was implemented annually by the Juvenile Justice and Youth Advocacy seniors. Launched in 2006, the Community Service Honor Roll highlighted the role colleges and universities have played in solving community challenges and as a result, in encouraging more students to pursue a lifelong path of civic engagement that achieves meaningful and measurable outcomes in the communities they serve. Honorees for the award were chosen based on a series of selection factors, including scope and innovation of service projects, percentage of student participation in service activities, incentives for service and the extent to which the school offers academic service-learning courses. This was the fourth consecutive year the Corporation for National and Community Service recognized Wheelock for achievements in community service with a place on the Honor Roll.\n\nThe Wheelock Wildcats participate in eleven NCAA Division III sports, competing in the New England Collegiate Conference.\n\nWomen's athletic teams:\n\nMen's athletic teams:\n\nIn addition to the varsity teams, there were intramural competitions between the Colleges of the Fenway.\n\n\n"}

The main characters are Vince Clark, a depressed, sardonic recluse played by Sean Lock, and Errol Spears, Vince's optimistic whipping boy, played by Benedict Wong.\n\nBoth radio shows (Sean Lock's 15 Minutes of Misery and Sean Lock: 15 Storeys High) were recorded in front of a studio audience.\nThe theme tune used on both radio series is the 1960s song \"England Swings\" by Roger Miller.\n\nThe show's original incarnation was a radio series entitled \"Sean Lock's 15 Minutes of Misery\". It was broadcast weekly on BBC Radio 4 in the \"Late Night on 4\" comedy slot at 11.00pm. It ran for six episodes between 30 December 1998 and 3 February 1999. The show was written by Sean Lock and produced by Dan Freedman, and starred Lock, Kevin Eldon and Hattie Hayridge.\n\nLock's second series was entitled \"Sean Lock: 15 Storeys High\", and it was also broadcast on Radio 4's \"Late Night on 4\" comedy slot and written by Sean Lock and Martin Trenaman and produced by Chris Neill. These series each consisted of five half-hour episodes. Series one aired from 24 November 1999 to 22 December 1999, and starred Lock, along with Felix Dexter, Jenny Eclair, Tim Mitchell, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Chris Pavlo and Peter Serafinowicz. Series two aired from 24 November 2000 to 22 December 2000, and included roles from Dan Freedman, Alex Lowe, Dan Mersh, Paul Putner, Rob Rouse and Chris Neill.\nThe 15 Storeys High radio series used a different method to present the events going on in other flats in the tower block. It dispensed with the idea of Sean listening in on others using \"Bugger King\", replacing it with a voiceover simply announcing the flat number of the subsequent scene. The show introduced Sean's flatmate Errol (played by Serafinowicz in series 1, episodes 2–5).\n\n\n\nIn 2002, 15 Storeys High was made into a television show which ran for two series, each series consisting of six half-hour episodes. In the television series, Lock's character was named Vince (he was simply Sean Lock in the radio series). Vince's flatmate Errol Spears was played by Benedict Wong. The TV shows were not recorded with a live audience.\n\nThe series was written by Lock, Trenaman and Mark Lamarr (credited under his real name, Mark Jones), and directed by Mark Nunneley. In the second TV series Lamarr is also credited as a writer. Digital comedy channel Gold began showing repeats of the first series during September 2014 as part of their \"After Dark\" comedy line-up schedules.\n\nThe flat in which Vince lives was actually filmed in a studio with large pictures of the adjacent tower blocks as a backdrop. All other flats in both series are real, and are located in the Brandon Estate, Kennington, London. The British science fiction drama \"Doctor Who\" has also used this location.\nThe location of the swimming pool, in which Vince works as a lifeguard, is Ladywell Leisure Centre in Lewisham, South East London in the first series. . In the second series, the swimming pool used is in the basement of the Shell Centre next to Waterloo station. The Elephant and Castle Shopping centre is also used as a location in several episodes, notably the Sundial restaurant and the Bowling alley.\n\nSeries one was initially broadcast on BBC Choice (the forerunner to BBC Three) from 7 November 2002 to 12 December 2002. Series two was broadcast from 12 February 2004 to 18 March 2004.\n\nThe show starred Sean Lock and Benedict Wong.

{"id": "2316065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316065", "title": "Drums and Wires", "text": "Drums and Wires\n\nDrums and Wires is the third studio album by the English rock band XTC, released 17 August 1979 on Virgin Records. It is a more pop-oriented affair than the band's previous, \"Go 2\" (1978), and was named for its emphasis on guitars (\"wires\") and expansive-sounding drums. The album was their first issued in the United States and their first recorded with guitarist Dave Gregory, who had replaced keyboardist Barry Andrews earlier in 1979. It features a mix of pop, art rock, new wave and punk styles with much rhythmic interplay between XTC's two guitarists.\n\nBassist Colin Moulding's dissatisfaction with XTC's \"quirky\" reputation inspired the group to take a more accessible approach, starting with the non-album single \"Life Begins at the Hop\". \"Drums and Wires\" was recorded in four weeks at the newly-built Town House studio in London with producer Steve Lillywhite and engineer Hugh Padgham, who were beginning to develop their signature gated reverb production technique, as demonstrated on the album opener and lead single \"Making Plans for Nigel\". Lyrically, the album focuses on the trappings or titillations of the modern world, with several songs about submitting to external forces. Frontman and guitarist Andy Partridge designed the cover artwork, which depicts the band logo forming the outline of a face.\n\n\"Drums and Wires\" reached number 34 on the UK Albums Chart and number 176 on the US \"Billboard\" 200. \"Making Plans for Nigel\" reached number 17 on the UK Singles Chart and marked the band's commercial breakthrough. In 1980, Partridge recorded \"Take Away / The Lure of Salvage\", an LP consisting mostly of dub remixes of \"Drums and Wires\" tracks. In later years, \"Drums and Wires\" became the best-known of XTC's discography. In 2004, it was ranked number 38 on \"Pitchfork\"s list of \"The Top Albums of the 1970s\", and in 2019, it was ranked number 31 in a similar list by \"Paste\".\n\nIn October 1978, XTC released their second studio album \"Go 2\", a more experimental venture than their debut \"White Music\". It was met with positive reviews and a number 21 chart peak. Keyboardist Barry Andrews left the band in December during their first American tour. Shortly prior, Andrews told journalists that he foresaw the band \"explod[ing] pretty soon\". Frontman and principal songwriter Andy Partridge commented: \"He enjoyed undermining what little authority I had in the band. We were bickering quite a lot. But when he left I thought, Oh shit, that's the sound of the band gone, this space-cream over everything. And I did enjoy his brain power, the verbal and mental fencing.\" XTC proceeded to run through a \"silly half-hearted\" process of auditioning another keyboardist. Although Thomas Dolby was rumoured as a replacement, Partridge said that Dolby was never actually considered, but did write many letters asking to join the band.\n\nRather than hiring a replacement keyboardist, Dave Gregory of the Swindon covers band Dean Gabber and His Gaberdines was invited to join as a second guitarist. Partridge remembered holding a \"pretend audition\" where Gregory was asked to play the band's \"This Is Pop\", only for Gregory to inquire whether they wanted the album version or the single version: \"We thought, 'Bloody oh, a real musician.' But he was in the band before he even knew.\" Gregory was anxious of whether the fans would accept him as a member, characterising himself as \"the archetypal pub-rocker in jeans and long hair. But the fans weren't bothered. Nobody was fashionable in XTC, ever.\" He grew more comfortable with the group after playing a few shows, he said, \"and things got better and better\".\n\nImpressed by the work of Steve Lillywhite, XTC contacted him to produce their third album with a drum sound that would \"knock your head off\". In the 1998 XTC biography \"Song Stories\", Partridge states that the band hired Lillywhite based on his work for Siouxsie and the Banshees' \"The Scream\" (1978). Partridge explained in a 1999 interview: \"Lillywhite mainly contributed to the drums' sound, very Siouxsie, more voodoo\". In 2019, he retracted his claim, saying that the Lillywhite record the band were impressed by was actually Ultravox's 1977 debut. With Virgin staff engineer Hugh Padgham, they embarked to the newly built Townhouse Studios, \"with its now world-famous stone room\", as described by Gregory, who recalled that Padgham had \"yet to develop his trade-mark 'gated ambience' sound\". Gregory stated that, ultimately, \"most of the ideas were Andy's but we were all contributing and Lillywhite was there as some sort of mediator more than anything. He's credited with producing it but really I think it was about 50/50. Most of the ideas were there in the first place before we got into the studio.\" Nick Lowe was also considered to produce \"Drums and Wires\". He was contacted but declined the offer, citing scheduling conflicts.\n\nCoinciding with Gregory's arrival, in April 1979, the band recorded \"Life Begins at the Hop\", written by bassist Colin Moulding, and their first record with Lillywhite producing. After the band went on tour for the single, sessions for \"Drums and Wires\" resumed from 25 June to July. By this time, Moulding \"wanted to ditch [our] quirky nonsense and do more straight-ahead pop.\" He said that when Andrews was in the band, Partridge had \"no kind of foil\" to work with, as he \"used to like the real kind of angular, spiky, upward-thrusting guitar ... if one is angular, the other has to kind of straighten him out, you know? It was just going too far the other way, I felt. So when Dave came in, and was a much straighter player, it seemed to make more sense, I think.\" Partridge opined that, before then, Moulding's songs \"came out as weird imitations of what I was doing, 'cause he thought that was the thing to do. ... On \"Go 2\" he was sort of getting his own style, and by \"Drums and Wires\" he really started to take off as a songwriter.\" Gregory remembered that XTC's songs \"inspired a different approach to listening and playing from that which I'd grown up with. I simply couldn't continue grinding out old blues clichés and power chords, so I began to think more in terms of the songs as the masters and the instruments as the servants.\" The album was recorded in three weeks and mixed in two.\n\n\"Drums and Wires\" was named for its emphasis on the sounds of guitars and expansive drums. The title was inspired by an illustration from \"The Beano\" depicting the comic dog Gnasher playing drums and \"BOOM DADA BOOM\" written above him. Partrige considered using the illustration for the cover, \"but it was a silly idea and 'Drums and Wires' seemed to suit the sound of the record. All drums and guitar strings.\" Lyrically, the album focuses on the trappings or titillations of the modern world, with several songs about submitting to external forces. Partridge's songs also centre on the impact of technology on human emotions.\n\nMusically, the album was described by \"Paste\" critic Lizzie Manno as featuring \"a bold, drum-centric\", \"polychromatic\", and \"coltish\" pop style, with \"a skittish punk energy and fierce grooves\". She went on to say its \"off-kilter fusion of art rock and New Wave swells with Andy Partridge and Colin Moulding’s mercurial pop yelps and pointed guitars\", and that the addition of Gregory to the band lent the music \"space for their transfixing guitar interplay\". In the words of Chris Dahlen from \"Pitchfork\", the band pursued \"pure pop disguised as jittery post-punk, all played with teeth-chattering intensity\", while \"Milenio\" writer Ernesto Herrera called the album a representative record of new wave. Editors at \"Trouser Press\" opined that it was a \"spiky art-pop gem\". Writing for \"Ultimate Classic Rock\" in 2019, critic Michael Galluci said the album is \"45 or so minutes of art-rock\" and argued that, \"even today, \"Drums and Wires\" sounds like an unconventional work among the period's angular, arty and evolving New Wave.\"\n\n8 of the album's 12 songs were written by Partridge, with the remaining 4 by Moulding. \"Making Plans for Nigel\" is told from the point of view of parents who are certain that their son Nigel is \"happy in his work\", affirming that his future in British Steel \"is as good as sealed\", and that he \"likes to speak and loves to be spoken to.\" The distinctive drum pattern was an attempt to invert drum tones and accents in the style of Devo's 1977 rendition of the Rolling Stones' \"Satisfaction\". Partridge remembered his discontent with the time devoted to the song's recording, remarking that \"[w]e spent a week doing Nigel and three weeks doing the rest of the album.\" \"Helicopter\" was inspired by Partridge's childhood memory of a 1960s magazine advertisement for Lego toys.\n\n\"When You're Near Me I Have Difficulty\" is about Vanessa Kearley, a girl that Partridge was infatuated with during his school years. It was briefly considered as a single, along with \"Real by Reel\". \"Ten Feet Tall\" was XTC's first acoustic song, inspired by Nick Lowe's \"Cruel to Be Kind\". Gregory thought it sounded so unlike the band that he suggested Moulding release it as a solo single.\n\n\"Real by Reel\" is about Partridge's anxieties toward government surveillance. \"That Is the Way\" is about Moulding's concerns toward how parents relate to their children. Its recording marked the first time XTC hired a session musician, flugelhorn player Dick Cuthell. \"Scissor Man\" is Partridge's attempt at an adult morality tale, based on \"The Story of the Thumb-Sucker\" from the German children's book \"Struwwelpeter\", and features a dub-influenced coda.\n\n”Outside World”, a frenetic number built on manic riffing from Gregory and Partridge, and a muscular bass-line by Moulding was considered as a possible single early on during the recording process. In addition to it being a live favorite, it has been described by Partridge as “the last gasp of punky XTC.\"\n\n\"Complicated Game\", according to Partridge, is \"one of those 'you get born and it doesn't matter and then you die' songs.\" He said that \"at that time in my life, I was starting to feel a sense of futility. I think it had to do with being in the band, and being stuck on the touring trail, and seemingly not having any control in my career.\" The \"Tom\" and \"Joe\" in its lyric refer to Tom Robinson and Joe Strummer, names which Partridge found by opening a random page of the \"NME\". Moulding held an electric razor against the microphone to provide the track's continuous buzzing sound. The song ends the LP with a crescendo of guitar sounds. Partridge overdubbed the flange-affected guitar solo without hearing the backing track using two Marshall amplifiers at maximum volume. As with the vocals, it was performed in one take.\n\nPartridge designed the album's cover artwork. As he remembers:\n\nIncluded was an insert featuring lyrics to all the songs on as well as the songs on XTC's previous albums, \"Go 2\" and \"White Music\". Partridge said this was done due to fans requesting the lyrics of XTC's songs. Early copies also included a bonus single: Partridge's \"Chain of Command\" backed with Moulding's \"Limelight\". \"Chain of Command\" is about \"wars\" among microbes in the human body. It was left off the album due to the band's dissatisfaction with the song. \"Limelight\", as interpreted by Partridge, is about their perception of how the band was viewed in their hometown of Swindon. \n\n\"Life Begins at the Hop\" was not included on the album due to industry convention in the 1960s and the 1970s, although the track appeared on some international variants, either as an addition or substitution. Other tracks were produced but left off the album: Partridge's \"Homo Safari\", \"Pulsing, Pulsing\" and \"Bushman President\". \"Homo Safari\" is an instrumental piece produced during the \"Life Begins at the Hop\" session. The \"homo\" simply refers to the Latin word for man, not a reference to homosexuality. \"Pulsing, Pulsing\" was recorded with an electric guitar that was not plugged in. \"Bushman President\" is another instrumental, and the second volume in Partridge's Homo Safari series. It was recorded entirely with a Korg monophonic synthesizer. Later, it was used as an introduction tape for the group's live performances.\n\n\"Life Begins at the Hop\" was released on 4 May 1979 and became the first charting single for the band, rising to number 54 on the UK Singles Chart. They played a 23-date English tour, playing to half- or quarter-full concert halls. In July, music videos directed by Russell Mulcahy were filmed for \"Making Plans for Nigel\" and \"Life Begins at the Hop\". From 25 July to 17 August, they embarked on another tour of Australia, which was more successful. Immediately following the tour, the band arrived in Japan and played four dates in Osaka. Partridge recalled the band encountering much fan hysteria in Japan: \"We could hardly go anywhere without being screamed at. You'd walk into a hotel lobby and there'd be a crowd of girls sitting around waiting for you.\"\n\n\"Drums and Wires\" was released on 17 August, with lead single \"Making Plans for Nigel\" following on 5 September. From 11 September to 5 October, XTC embarked on another underwhelming British tour. Gregory remembered: \"in Wolverhampton [there were] about 200 people in a place that holds about 1,500. It was really depressing.\" The single later rose to number 17 and helped propel the album to number 37 in the UK. It was also their first album to chart in the US, at number 176. Afterward, the single was playlisted at the BBC, which helped the band secure two appearances on \"Top of the Pops\". When touring resumed on 23 November, every date was sold out. Elsewhere, A union of 100,000 steel workers went on strike and contacted Moulding for a statement on their issues, but he offered no comment. British Steel also gathered four Sheffield employees named Nigel to discuss job satisfaction for the trade publication \"Steel News\". Performances of \"Real by Real\" and \"Ten Feet Tall\" recorded for BBC Radio were later released for \"\" (1994).\n\nThe LP sold particularly well in Canada, Europe and Australia. In Canada, the record hit number 2 and went gold, selling over 50,000 copies. The band still felt that they were not \"fashionable\" in England. In their homeland, sales were at a minimal improvement from their previous records. Virgin requested Lillywhite to remix \"Real by Real\", \"When You're Near Me I Have Difficulty\", \"Helicopter\" and \"Outside World\" as potential follow-up singles, but the new mixes were rejected by the group. Instead, the band recorded \"Wait Till Your Boat Goes Down\", a reggae-influenced Partridge song with production by Phil Wainman of Bay City Rollers fame. It was their lowest-selling single to date. They also rerecorded \"Ten Feet Tall\" to have electric guitar in its arrangement. It was released as their first US single to coincide with their first tour there, which lasted from 14 January to 14 March. Most of the gigs were small club dates, with three East Coast dates supporting the Police, and were not particularly significant. Exceptions included a house record-breaking six consecutive sold-out shows at the Whisky a Go Go in West Hollywood, California. In Canada, XTC played to theatres and universities before larger crowds.\n\n\"Drums and Wires\" received favourable reviews, and according to biographer Chris Twomey, was \"widely acknowledged in the music business\". \"NME\" Paul Morley decreed that XTC were \"doing all sorts of they've never done before and never hinted they would. ... They have moved many steps forward to making a rock classic.\" In \"Billboard\", the album was deemed \"an interesting package from a label that's beginning to make headway in the U.S. It's fresh rock 'n' roll in a new wave vein with a dash of '60s English melody. Of particular note is the inventive mix as instruments sparkle in both left and right channels.\" \"The Village Voice\" critic Robert Christgau wrote: \"My reservations about this tuneful but willfully eccentric pop are ideological. ... Partridge and Colin Moulding are moving toward a great art-pop mean that will set standards for the genre. Catchy, funny, interesting—and it rocks.\"\n\n\"Rolling Stone\"s Jon Pareles called the album XTC's \"least-dissonant\" and identified the band's \"current obsession\" as \"Philip Glass Steve Reich-style static harmony, and their favorite complicated game is to stalemate pop progressions with immobile arrangements.\" He criticised the group's \"Beatles fixation\", bemoaning when the band appears \"to cop from outside sources\", such as the melody of the Beatles' \"Please Please Me\" in \"When You're Near Me I Have Difficulty\". \"Playboy\" published a single-sentence review: \"Devo clones that sound more like the old Maxwell House percolator than like a rock band.\"\n\nOn 8 October 1979 the band performed four songs from the album for BBC Radio 1's John Peel show. \n\nAllMusic reviewer Chris Woodstra reflected that the album signalled \"a turning point ... with a more subdued set of songs that reflect an increasing songwriting proficiency. The aimless energy of the first two albums is focused into a cohesive statement with a distinctive voice that retains their clever humor, quirky wordplay, and decidedly British flavor. ... driven by the powerful rhythms and angular, mainly minimalistic arrangements.\" Greg Kot of the \"Chicago Tribune\" cited the album as \"among the more accomplished records of its time-edgy, brisk and sarcastic, with pop gems such as 'Making Plans for Nigel' and 'Life Begins at the Hop.'\" \"Ultimate Classic Rock\"s Michael Galluci said it was XTC's \"first great album\" and the first in a \"string of musically ambitious records\".\n\nIn 2004, \"Drums and Wires\" was ranked number 38 on Pitchfork's list of the 100 best albums of the 1970s. Contributor Chris Dahlen wrote: \"Dozens of other contemporary bands were more extreme in every way—angrier, more danceable, more adventurous or primitive or whatever—but this triple-jointed sock hop out-charms them all.\" In 2016, \"Making Plans for Nigel\" was ranked number 143 on the website's list of the 200 best songs of the 1970s. In 2019, \"Drums and Wires\" was ranked number 31 in a similar list by \"Paste\".\n\n\"Drums and Wires\" became the best-known album of XTC's discography. Partridge and Moulding reflected on the period as the point in which XTC's \"career really started\". Gregory did not think he would remain with the band. He remembered: \"I don't think I took my role in XTC seriously right up to \"English Settlement\". \"Drums and Wires\" was just great fun to me. ... The next thing we knew we were getting four-star reviews in all the papers. How did that happen?\" Lillywhite and Padgham returned for the band's follow-up album \"Black Sea\" (1980). Only Padgham was recruited for the record after, \"English Settlement\" (1982), as Partridge felt \"it was Hugh who was getting all the great sounds\".\n\nIn Moulding's recollection, \"Up until that point, we were viewed as a poor man’s Talking Heads or something. People called us 'quirky.' But when we came out with \"Drums and Wires\" it was like a different band, really. Mainly, that was probably my fault.\" He was surprised when the label begun choosing his songs, instead of Partridge's, as singles. Partridge felt that he was losing the band's leadership and attempted to exert more authority in the group, calling himself \"a very benevolent dictator.\"\n\nIn early 1980, Partridge recorded the side LP \"Take Away\" / \"The Lure of Salvage\"; a one-off record consisting of dub remixes of XTC songs that appeared without much notice, except in Japan, where it was hailed as a work of \"electronic genius\" and outsold all other XTC albums. The majority of its tracks sampled material from \"Drums and Wires\". In 1982, music journalist Mark Fisher created the XTC fanzine \"Limelight\", named after the B-side single. \"Complicated Game\" served as the title of a 2016 book by Partridge and journalist Todd Bernhardt, which contains discussions between the two on various XTC songs.\n\n\n\"Drums and Wires\" was reissued on CD and Blu-ray in October 2014, boasting a new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mix of the album from remixer Steven Wilson, as well as new liner notes from Partridge, Moulding and Gregory, alternate mixes and nearly 40 demo and rehearsal tracks. Partridge said of the new mix: \"It's so good it's upped my opinion of the album.\"\n\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes, except where noted.\n\nXTC\n\nAdditional personnel\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n"}
{"id": "2316066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316066", "title": "Blankety Blanks (Australian game show)", "text": "Blankety Blanks (Australian game show)\n\nBlankety Blanks is an Australian game show based on the American game show \"Match Game\". It was hosted by Graham Kennedy on Network Ten from 1977–1978.\n\nPanelists were Ugly Dave Gray, Jon English, Noeline Brown, Carol Raye, Stuart Wagstaff, Kate Fitzpatrick, Noel Ferrier, Dawn Lake, Barry Creyton, Mark Holden, John Paul Young, Peggy Toppano, Peta Toppano, Belinda Giblin, Abigail, Nick Tate, Tommy Hanlon Junior, Wendy Blacklock and Delvene Delaney.\n\n\"Blankety Blanks\" had a two-season run from 1977 to 1978. It was screened at a rate of five, thirty-minute episodes each week, stripped across an early evening timeslot. In Sydney and Melbourne, it was broadcast in the 7pm timeslot across both seasons. It was a ratings success, beating the flagship current affairs programs \"Willesee At Seven\" on the Seven Network and \"A Current Affair\" on the Nine Network, and on occasions achieving ratings in the low 40s. It was only after this ratings success that Network Ten revealed Kennedy was paid an unprecedented $1 million per season.\n\nIn 1978, Kennedy won a TV Week Gold Logie Award for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television. When Kennedy had a bout with pneumonia, announcer Don Blake was forced to host the show for an episode.\n\nTwo contestants, including a returning champion, competed. The contestants were always a man and a woman – at no point during the series did two people of the same gender compete. The object was to match the answers of the six celebrity panelists to fill-in-the-blank statements.\n\nThe main game was played in two rounds. The challenger was given a choice of two statements labeled either \"A\" or \"B.\" Kennedy then read the statement. Many of the show's questions were designed as \"double entendres\", such as \"Joan and Paul went to bed and Joan asked Paul to (BLANK) her\".\n\nThe celebrity panelists wrote their answers on cards, after which the contestant gave their answer. Kennedy then asked each celebrity in turn, beginning in the upper left hand corner, to reveal their response. The contestant earned one point for a matching answer (or reasonably similar as determined by the adjudicator – producer Tony Connelly who was dubbed by Kennedy \"Tony the moustache twirler\").\n\nAfter completion of the round, Kennedy read the question on the other card for the returning champion and play was identical.\n\nThe challenger again began Round 2, with two new questions, unless he/she matched everyone in the first round. Only panelists that a contestant didn't previously match played this round. If the players tied with the same score at the end of the round the scores were reset to 0–0. Play continued until there was a clear winner.\n\nThe winner of the game went on to play the \"Super Match\". The contestant had to match a word in a fill-in-the-blank phrase with the most popular response given in an audience survey. The contestant could consult three panelists for suggestions. The most popular answer in the survey was worth $100, the second-most popular $50, and the third most popular $25. The contestant won the amount of the answer they matched with.\n\nIf a contestant failed to match any of the three answers, the bonus round ended. If successful the contestant had the opportunity to win 10 times that amount in the \"Head-To-Head Match\". In this part of the game, they must match another fill-in-the-blank response with a celebrity panelist of his or her choice. If successful, he/she won the money accumulated in both parts of the round. Either way, the winning contestant could keep playing until defeated by another challenger.\n\nMany questions were quotations of a fictional character named Cyril, and would begin \"Cyril said...\" with the quotation recited by Kennedy in a stereotypical gay male voice (Cyril was Kennedy's middle name). Another recurring character in the questions was Dumb Dora – a joke borrowed from \"Match Game\". A recurring comedy skit between Kennedy and Gray involved discussion about a man named \"Dick\", leading to \"Did Dick?\", \"Dick did!\" exchanges between Kennedy and Ugly Dave Gray.\n\nKennedy's risque brand of humour often nudged the boundaries of contemporary Australian broadcasting standards. Peter Hough was the crew member behind the show's sets pulling the lever that uncovered the correct answers on the board. In one running gag he was dubbed \"Peter the Phantom Puller\" by Kennedy. To reveal each answer in turn, Kennedy would call out \"Peter could you have a pull\", \"Pull it Peter!\", etc.\n\nIn one episode Kennedy came on with a prepared list of \"rude\" words which were deemed acceptable to be spoken on-air. Throughout the episode, he would suddenly launch into a chant of \"wee poo bum, wee poo bum!\"\n\nThe series was a Reg Grundy production based on the long-running American game show \"Match Game\", which had been created by Mark Goodson and Bill Todman. Indeed, the \"Blankety Blanks\" set looked almost identical to its American counterpart. The series also used a similarly stylised logo.\n\nOne of the conditions Kennedy requested when he started \"Blankety Blanks\" was the right to choose the members of the panel. If they worked well they would be retained, but if they didn't, they wouldn't be asked back.\n\nThe first episode aired on TEN-10 Sydney on Monday, 24 January 1977 at 7:30pm, where it was telecast Monday to Friday. After six weeks of broadcasting at 7:30pm the show was moved into the 7pm slot, where it remained through to the end of its first season on Friday 2 December 1977. After summer break, the show returned to TEN-10 on Monday 9 January 1978 and remained at 7pm Monday to Friday for its entire second season.\n\nIn October 1978 the series came up for renewal, and Ten was keen to renew the series. Kennedy consulted key panelist Ugly Dave Gray about the potential renewal. Gray felt he had used every joke he had done in his life and exhausted the comic potential of the formula and expressed a desire to not continue with the series. Kennedy observed that the ratings were down from earlier figures; although earlier figures were unusually high (ratings in the 40s), recent figures in the 30s range were still extremely high. In any event, Kennedy informed Ten that he would not be continuing with the series, and the show ended its run on TEN-10 Sydney on Friday 3 November 1978.\n\nThe series has been repeated many times since its run ended. It was shown by the Ten Network many times though the 1980s. In the 2000s it has been screened in Foxtel's TV1. Beginning in January 2009, The Comedy Channel began screening back-to-back episodes on Friday nights.\n\nA DVD set of 30 episodes was released in late 2005.\n\nOther Australian games using the same format appeared in later decades. A 1985-1986 version hosted by Daryl Somers on the Nine Network had moderate success. This was followed by a second revival in 1996–97, again appearing on the same network as before. This time, it was hosted by Shane Bourne and regular panelists included Marty Fields, Rhonda Burchmore, Tim Smith, Nicky Buckley, Ian \"Molly\" Meldrum, Jane Turner and Sam Newman. This had slightly more success, lasting two seasons. Both of these versions followed the same format as the Kennedy version, but with a top prize of $5,000 (Audience Match amounts were $500–$250–$100, equaling those from the 1973–1982 American versions of \"Match Game\"). In the second round of the 1990s revival, both players and the panel wrote their answers to the same statement and the player who played second in the first round chose whether to play with the top or bottom row and each match scored 2 points.\n\nIn the United Kingdom a version based on the format, called \"Blankety Blank\" in which it was later re-titled as \"Lily Savage's Blankety Blank\", was very popular, running from 1979–1990 and from 1997-1999 on BBC1 along with a brief revival on ITV from 2001–2002. The hosts were Terry Wogan from 1979 until 1983, followed by Les Dawson from 1984 until 1990 and Lily Savage (played by Paul O'Grady) from 1997 until 1999 and again from 2001 until 2002. After being off the air for more than fourteen years, in 2016, a revival of the series was made as a one-time Christmas special on ITV, hosted by David Walliams along with: Joe Lycett, Anne Robinson (of \"The Weakest Link\" fame), Paul and Barry Chuckle (a.k.a. The Chuckle Brothers), Lesley Joseph, Louis Walsh and Brooke Vincent as the six panelists.\n\n\n"}

Shuniah, named after the Ojibwa word \"\"zhooniyaa\"\" for \"money\" or \"silver\" (see the French \"argent\"), was settled largely due to silver mining potential identified in the mid-19th century.\n\nThe township is part of Thunder Bay's Census Metropolitan Area, and consists of the communities of Amethyst Harbour, Ancliff, Bowker, Ishkibibble, Loon, Mackenzie, Navilus, Pass Lake, Pearl, Silver Harbour and Wild Goose.\n\nServing today primarily as a rural bedroom community to Thunder Bay, Shuniah is also a popular cottaging locale with 40 kilometres of Lake Superior's northern shoreline.

{"id": "2316077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316077", "title": "Red Line (Sound Transit)", "text": "Red Line (Sound Transit)\n\nThe Red Line, formerly Central Link, is a light rail line in Seattle, Washington, United States, and part of Sound Transit's Link light rail system. It serves 16 stations in the cities of Seattle, SeaTac, and Tukwila, traveling between and stations. The line connects the University District, Downtown Seattle, the Rainier Valley, and Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. The Red Line carried over 24 million total passengers in 2018, with an average of 72,000 daily passengers on weekdays. It runs for 20 hours per day on weekdays and Saturdays, with headways of up to six minutes during peak hours, and reduced 18-hour service on Sundays and holidays.\n\nTrains are composed of two or more cars that each can carry 194 passengers, including 74 in seats, along with wheelchairs and bicycles. Fares are calculated based on distance traveled and are paid through the regional ORCA card, paper tickets, or a mobile app. Sound Transit uses proof-of-payment to verify passenger fares, employing fare inspectors and transit police to conduct random inspections. All stations have ticket vending machines, public art, bicycle parking, and bus connections, while several also have park-and-ride lots.\n\nVoters approved Central Link in a 1996 ballot measure and construction began in 2003, after the project was reorganized under a new budget and truncated route in response to higher than expected costs. The light rail line, which followed decades of failed transit plans for the Seattle region, opened on July 18, 2009, terminating at in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel and near Sea–Tac Airport. It was extended south to in December 2009, north to the University of Washington in March 2016, and south to Angle Lake in September 2016. The line is scheduled to be extended north to in 2021, when it will be redesignated as Line 1 (colored green).\n\nFurther extensions to Lynnwood and Federal Way are planned to open in 2024. East Link will open in 2023, connecting Seattle to the Eastside suburbs and forming a multi-line network via its connection with the Red Line. Further expansion under Sound Transit 3 will divide the current corridor between two lines, the Red Line from Snohomish County to West Seattle, and the Green Line from Ballard to Tacoma.\n\nPublic transit service within Seattle began in 1884, with the introduction of the city's first horse-drawn streetcar line. The system had been replaced with a network of electric streetcars and cable cars by the end of the decade, which spurred the development of new streetcar suburbs across modern-day Seattle. Interurban railways to Everett, Tacoma, and the Rainier Valley were established after the turn of the century, giving the region an intercity passenger rail system to feed the streetcar lines. The interurban system failed to compete with the increasing popularity of automobile travel, capped by the completion of U.S. Route 99 in the late 1920s, and was shut down. By 1941, the streetcars had also been acquired by the municipal government and replaced with a trolleybus network.\n\nVarious proposals for a rapid transit system in Seattle, to replace the streetcar—and later bus—networks, were presented in the 20th century and rejected by city officials or voters due to their cost or other factors. In 1911, urban planner Virgil Bogue proposed a system of subway tunnels and elevated railways as the centerpiece to a comprehensive plan for the city, which was rejected by voters. The Seattle Center Monorail, originally built for the 1962 World's Fair, has been the subject of several unsuccessful expansion proposals backed by Governor Albert Rosellini in the 1960s and Seattle voters in the early 2000s. The Forward Thrust Committee of the late 1960s proposed a rapid transit system, to connect Downtown Seattle to Ballard, the University District, Lake City, Capitol Hill, Bellevue, and Renton. The federal government offered to fund two-thirds of the rail system's capital costs, approximately $770 million (equivalent to $ in dollars), if $385 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) in local property taxes were approved by voters. The rapid transit initiative was placed on the ballot in February 1968, but failed to receive the necessary supermajority to pass. A second attempt in May 1970, with $440 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) in local funding and $870 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) in federal funding, failed amid a local economic downturn caused by layoffs at Boeing. The federal funding earmarked towards the rapid transit system was granted to Atlanta, Georgia, forming the initial funding for the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority's rail system.\n\nFollowing the failed Forward Thrust initiatives, Metro Transit was created in 1972 to oversee a countywide bus network, and plan for a future rail system. In the early 1980s, Metro Transit and the Puget Sound Council of Governments (PSCOG) explored light rail and busway concepts to serve the region, ultimately choosing to build a downtown transit tunnel that would be convertible from buses to light rail at a later date. The PSCOG formally endorsed a light rail plan in 1986, recommending a system be built by 2020, and include a line between Seattle and Sea-Tac Airport, with routing alternatives that served the Rainier Valley. A 1988 advisory measure on light rail planning was passed in King County, encouraging Metro Transit to accelerate the plan's timeline to open by 2000. In 1990, the state legislature endorsed the creation of a regional transit board composed of politicians from King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties, with the goal of implementing the regional transit plan. Several members of the Seattle City Council endorsed the rail plan on the condition that it pass through the Rainier Valley, by then an economically disadvantaged and majority-minority neighborhood.\n\nThe Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority, later renamed Sound Transit, was created in 1993 to write and present a regional transit plan for voter approval. The agency proposed a light rail network as the centerpiece of a $6.7 billion transit ballot measure, with a surface line through the Rainier Valley and tunnels between Downtown Seattle, Capitol Hill, and the University District. The ballot measure failed to pass on March 14, 1995, and the light rail line was shortened to , between the University District and Sea-Tac Airport. Voters approved the $3.9 billion package on November 5, 1996, along with increases to sales taxes and motor vehicle excise taxes across the regional transit district. Sound Transit considered several routing options during a series of public hearings and studies early into the project's environmental impact study, which adopted the name \"Central Link\". In 1999, Sound Transit selected the alignment for the light rail project, consisting of a line between the University District and Sea-Tac Airport, with surface segments passing through Tukwila, the Rainier Valley, and SoDo, and tunnels under Beacon Hill, First Hill, Capitol Hill, and Portage Bay.\n\nThe Central Link project was originally planned to open in 2006 and projected to cost $1.9 billion (equivalent to $ in dollars), but the estimates were found to be unrealistic by auditors in November 2000. New executives, hired by Sound Transit to replace previous program directors, presented a revised plan with an opening date pushed back three years to 2009, costing $3.8 billion (equivalent to $ in dollars). Planning of the Portage Bay tunnel between Capitol Hill and the University District was suspended due to higher than expected contractor bids, attributed to difficult soil conditions. Sound Transit adopted the revised budget and schedule in January 2001, including provisions to re-study routing options between Downtown Seattle and the University District, along with a $500 million federal grant agreement to fund the construction of an \"initial segment\" for the project. The initial segment identified and approved by Sound Transit later that year shortened the line to , between Downtown Seattle and a southern Tukwila station near Sea-Tac Airport. The remaining routes to the airport and University District were sent back to the planning stage, and re-organized into separate light rail projects.\n\nIn November 2001, Sound Transit approved construction of the shortened Central Link light rail project, calling for a summer 2002 groundbreaking. Property acquisition in the Rainier Valley began in March 2002, but two legal battles delayed the start of construction. In November 2002, the King County Superior Court ruled in favor of Sound Transit in a lawsuit filed by light rail opponents, alleging that it lacked the authority to shorten a voter-approved line. The approval of Tim Eyman's Initiative 776 threatened to repeal motor vehicle excise taxes needed to fund Sound Transit's budget, but was declared unconstitutional in February 2003. Another routing change requested by the City of Tukwila, placing light rail tracks along freeways in lieu of International Boulevard, was approved by Sound Transit and the Federal Transit Administration in 2002, moving the project closer to construction.\n\nSound Transit received its $500 million federal grant agreement in October 2003, and a groundbreaking ceremony was held in SoDo on November 8, 2003. Construction contracts for various segments were awarded in 2004 and 2005, coming six percent under Sound Transit's estimates, and work began along all parts of the system. The first rails were installed on August 18, 2005, in the SoDo area; a month later, the downtown transit tunnel closed for a two-year renovation to accommodate light rail service. Excavation of the Beacon Hill tunnel and station began in 2005, and two tunnel boring machines were launched in early 2006 to bore the twin tunnels between SoDo and the Rainier Valley.\n\nThe SODO and Stadium stations were completed in May 2006, and light rail testing in the SoDo area began the following March. Testing was extended to the re-opened downtown transit tunnel in September 2007, initially limited to weekends without bus service, and further to the Rainier Valley after the completion of the Beacon Hill tunnel in 2008. The elevated guideway in Tukwila, including crossings over major freeways and the Duwamish River, was completed in 2007 after the installation of 2,457 precast concrete segments and balanced cantilever bridges. During construction in the Rainier Valley, Sound Transit and the City of Seattle offered $50 million in mitigation funds and development opportunities to affected businesses. Construction of light rail along Martin Luther King Jr. Way South also resulted in utility lines being moved underground, improved sidewalks, street crossings, and landscaping.\n\nCentral Link was opened on July 18, 2009, with a community celebration that attracted more than 92,000 riders over the first weekend of free service. Trains began operating on the segment between and stations, along with a bus shuttle to serve Sea-Tac Airport from Tukwila. The extension to SeaTac/Airport station opened on December 19, 2009, replacing the shuttle and other bus services to the airport. Sound Transit added lubrication equipment and rubber mats to segments in Tukwila and the Rainier Valley in 2010 to reduce noise levels that had reached up to 83 decibels, surpassing federal safety standards and triggering noise complaints from nearby residents. A contract dispute with the Rainier Valley construction contractor was settled in 2011, bringing the project's total price to $117 million below the $2.44 billion budget. The opening of light rail service to the Rainier Valley spurred new transit-oriented development, which had initially stalled during the Great Recession but recovered in the mid-2010s.\n\nCentral Link train service was increased to a frequency of six minutes during peak hours, from 7.5 minutes, in 2015 to prepare for the opening of the University Link extension. The line was extended north to University of Washington station, via Capitol Hill station, on March 19, 2016, via a $1.8 billion, tunnel. The extension opened six months ahead of its scheduled date, and the opening celebrations drew 67,000 people during the first day of service. Sound Transit deployed additional three-car light rail trains to cope with higher ridership after the extension opened. The line was extended south from Sea-Tac Airport to Angle Lake station on September 24, 2016, including the opening of a 1,120-stall park and ride.\n\nThe escalators at Capitol Hill and University of Washington stations experienced several major failures and shutdowns in the two years since the University Link extension was opened. These failures were attributed to the installation of standard commercial escalators instead of stronger escalators designed for transit stations and are planned to be replaced by 2022 with new escalators and alternate stairways. The Tukwila section of the line was shut down over one weekend in October 2018 for major repairs after cracks were discovered in the rails on the bridge crossing Interstate 5. In September 2019, Central Link was renamed to the \"Red Line\" as part of a systemwide rebranding by Sound Transit to prepare for the arrival of East Link (the Blue Line). Two months later, the agency announced that it would consider a new name after complaints due to the similarity of the \"Red Line\" with redlining, which historically affected residents of the Rainier Valley. A new designation, Line 1 (colored green), is planned to be used beginning in 2021.\n\nIn January 2020, Sound Transit began a ten-week construction project called \"Connect 2020\" that required trains to single-track in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel. The closure of tracks for work on the East Link Extension where it meets the existing tracks at International District/Chinatown necessitated the construction of a temporary center platform at Pioneer Square for use by through-riding passengers. Sound Transit deployed four-car trains running every 13–15 minutes and implemented restrictions on carrying bicyclists on trains through downtown. The project was completed in late March after a week-long delay in testing, but the frequency restrictions remained due to the coronavirus pandemic and local shutdowns.\n\nThe Red Line's northern terminus is University of Washington station, located near Husky Stadium and the campus of the University of Washington in northeastern Seattle. The line heads south in the University Link tunnel, crossing under the Montlake Cut of the Lake Washington Ship Canal and State Route 520 before taking a turn to the southwest. The tunnel climbs Capitol Hill and passes under Interlaken Park and Volunteer Park before turning due south to enter Capitol Hill station on the east side of Broadway. The tunnel makes a gradual turn to the west, dipping as far south as East Union Street, and crosses under Interstate 5 at Pine Street. It merges into the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel within the Pine Street Stub Tunnel, where it formerly merged with buses from Convention Place station.\n\nThe downtown transit tunnel, formerly shared between light rail trains and buses, travels west under Pine Street through Westlake station and south on 3rd Avenue through University Street and Pioneer Square stations in Downtown Seattle. The tunnel ends at International District/Chinatown station, adjacent to King Street Station (served by Amtrak and Sounder commuter rail), and the Red Line travels south through SoDo along the east side of the SODO Busway. The SoDo section has two stations, Stadium and SODO, and includes several gated crossings. From SODO station, the track ascends to an elevated guideway traveling east along South Forest Street, passing the line's railyard and maintenance facility. The elevated trackway passes over Airport Way and comes to rest on an embankment under Interstate 5, entering the Beacon Hill tunnel.\n\nThe Beacon Hill tunnel travels approximately under Beacon Hill, serving a station at Beacon Avenue South. Trains exit the tunnel on the east side of the hill, turning southeast and approaching the elevated Mount Baker station at the intersection of Rainier Avenue South and Martin Luther King Jr. Way South. Light rail trains descend from Mount Baker station onto the median of Martin Luther King Jr. Way South, running at-grade with signal priority at 28 street crossings. The Red Line passes through the Rainier Valley and serves three at-grade stations, , , and , before leaving Seattle.\n\nThe line enters Tukwila and crosses west over Interstate 5 and a mainline railroad at Boeing Access Road, near Boeing Field, before making a southward turn over East Marginal Way South. The Red Line continues south over the Duwamish River, traveling non-stop through Tukwila on a elevated guideway. The guideway runs along the west sides of State Route 599 and Interstate 5 towards Southcenter Mall, where it turns west along State Route 518. The line passes through Tukwila International Boulevard station, home to a 600-stall park and ride facility, and turns south into the median of the Airport Expressway towards SeaTac. Light rail trains continue along the east side of Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, stopping at SeaTac/Airport station near the airport's terminals, before reaching Angle Lake station, where it terminates.\n\nThe Red Line, while officially a \"light rail\" line, has also been described as a \"light metro\" hybrid by transit experts due to its grade separated sections and use of larger trainsets than typical American light rail systems. Approximately of the line is at-grade, including segments along freeways that are separated from intersecting roads.\n\nThe Red Line's stations are spaced approximately apart in most areas and are built with platforms to accommodate four-car train sets. Some stations are grade separated, with underground or elevated platforms connected to surface entrances by stairs, escalators, and elevators, while others were built at street level. The line's sixteen stations include bus connections, ticket vending machines, real-time arrivals information signs, public art, and bicycle parking. Stations are also designed with clear sight lines on platforms, emergency phones and lights, and are monitored with surveillance cameras.\n\n, there are only two stations with park and ride facilities (Angle Lake and Tukwila International Boulevard); for other stations, Sound Transit and local governments are encouraging alternative means of transportation to and from stations, including bus riding, walking, or bicycling. Since 2019, a set of five stations in the Rainier Valley and Tukwila have had on-demand ride-hail shuttle service that accepts Metro fares and is operated by private contractor Via with subsidies from the city government.\n\nThe Red Line's light rail trains run 20 hours per day from Monday to Saturday, from 5:00 am to 1:00 am, and 18 hours on Sundays and federal holidays, from 6:00 am to midnight. Trains operate most frequently during weekday peak periods, running every six minutes from 6:00 am to 9:30 am and from 3:00 pm to 6:30 pm. Trains run every 10 minutes during midday and evening hours on weekdays and all day on weekends. Train frequency is reduced to every 15 minutes during the early morning and late night hours of all days.\n\nEnd-to-end travel from University of Washington to Angle Lake stations takes 48 minutes, while trips between SeaTac/Airport station and Downtown Seattle take 38 minutes. The SeaTac–Westlake corridor was formerly served by King County Metro bus route 194, which took 32 minutes to travel between the two areas, and used bus stops that were closer to the terminal. The bus route ran at less frequent intervals, was subject to traffic delays, and had shorter hours of operation.\n\nRed Line trains carried over 24.4 million total passengers in 2018, averaging 76,000 riders on weekdays. Ridership is measured by on-board infrared passenger counters that automatically record the number of people entering and leaving the train.\n\nRidership on the Red Line has risen significantly from the beginning of service in 2009, when it averaged 15,500 per weekday. In 2010, ridership fell below projected levels due to the ongoing economic downturn, with only 21,611 daily riders on the line. Ridership increased significantly in the following years, surpassing 25,000 daily riders in 2012, 30,000 in 2014, and 35,000 in 2015.\n\nThe opening of the University Link extension in March 2016 increased daily ridership by 66 percent in its first month of operation, and averaged 66,203 daily riders during the last quarter of the year. A single-day ridership record of 82,361 estimated boardings was set on April 8, 2016, credited to a Seattle Mariners home opener and the Emerald City Comic Con. The record was surpassed five months later on September 30, estimated at 101,000 riders, due in part to home games for the Washington Huskies football team and Seattle Mariners.\n\nThe Red Line uses a proof-of-payment system, requiring valid payment before boarding and lacking a turnstile barrier at stations. Fares can be purchased as paper tickets at ticket vending machines at stations, credit or passes loaded on an ORCA card, or through a mobile ticketing app. Fare inspectors and transit police officers check for valid fares while aboard trains or in the fare-paid zone of stations; warnings and a $124 citation are issued to passengers who do not present a valid ticket or a validated ORCA card.\n\nFares are calculated based on distance traveled, ranging from $2.25 to $3.25 for adults. ORCA card users are required to tap a reader before and after riding a train to calculate the fare. Reduced fares are available to elderly passengers, persons with disabilities, persons under the age of 18, and low-income passengers enrolled in ORCA Lift. Transfers from other modes, including buses, water taxis, and streetcars, are only accepted using ORCA cards.\n\nThe current Red Line fleet consists of 62 low-floor light rail vehicles manufactured in Japan by Kinkisharyo. The Kinkisharyo vehicles, built through a joint venture with Mitsui & Co., have 74 seats and can carry 194 seated and standing passengers at standard capacity; a maximum \"crush load\" of 252 passengers per car can be carried by Link trains for short distances. Individual railcars are long and wide, sporting dual cabs that allow cars to travel in either direction. The interior is 70 percent low-floor, while the remaining 30 percent is raised above the floor and accessed via stairs. Railcars include four doors on each side, fold-up seating areas for wheelchairs, and two bicycle hooks above luggage storage areas. Red Line trains are typically arranged into two-car and three-car sets, but station platforms are built to accommodate four-car trains. The trains have a top speed of , but typically operate at on surface sections and on elevated and tunneled sections. Link uses a form of positive train control to prevent trains from exceeding the set speed limit for a given area.\n\nTrains are supplied electricity through an overhead catenary that is energized at 1,500 volts direct current and converted to three-phase alternating current through on-board inverters. While other North American light rail systems use 750 V technology, Sound Transit chose to use 1,500 V to reduce the number of electrical substations, which are spaced approximately apart. Sound Transit placed its initial order of 31 light rail vehicles in 2003, and added four more vehicles in 2005 for the extension to SeaTac/Airport station. The cars were assembled in Everett, to comply with Buy America requirements, and delivered from 2006 to 2008. Another 27 vehicles were ordered for the University Link extension in 2009 and were delivered from 2010 to 2011. The Red Line fleet is stored and maintained at a operating base in SoDo, between SODO and Beacon Hill stations. It opened in 2007, at a cost of $74 million to construct, and has a capacity of 105 light rail vehicles, including nine bays inside the maintenance building that can hold 16 vehicles. Red Line trains are operated and maintained by King County Metro under contract with Sound Transit.\n\nIn September 2016, Sound Transit approved a $554 million order to Siemens Mobility for 122 S70 light rail vehicles that will serve planned extensions to Northgate, Lynnwood, the Eastside, and Federal Way. Another 30 vehicles were added to the order in April 2017, bringing the total to 152 vehicles. The first Siemens car arrived at Sound Transit's maintenance facility in June 2019, featuring the same seating capacity but a wider central walkway and other new features; it is planned to enter service in 2020. A satellite maintenance facility, with a capacity of 96 vehicles, is planned to be constructed in Bellevue by 2020 to accommodate part of the new fleet.\n\nSound Transit's expansion ballot measures, passed as Sound Transit 2 in 2008 and Sound Transit 3 in 2016, enabled the planning of future Link light rail extensions, scheduled to open in stages between 2021 and 2040. The Northgate Link extension is scheduled to open in 2021, extending service north to Northgate Transit Center, followed by the East Link Extension in 2023, creating a new line to Bellevue and Redmond. During construction related to East Link in early 2020, trains within the downtown transit tunnel are planned to be limited to single-track operations and divided into two lines at Pioneer Square station.\n\nThe Red Line will be extended south and north to the suburbs of Federal Way and Lynnwood, respectively, in 2024 as part of the Sound Transit 2 program. In 2030, a branch of the Red Line to West Seattle will begin service, temporarily operating between Alaska Junction and SODO station. The opening of an extension to Ballard in 2035, traveling via a new tunnel through Downtown Seattle, will split the corridor between two lines: the Red Line, operating from Lynnwood (and later Everett) to West Seattle; and the Green Line, operating from Ballard to Tacoma via the Rainier Valley and Sea-Tac Airport. Two infill stations along the current route of the Red Line are planned to open in 2031 at South Graham Street in the Rainier Valley and Boeing Access Road in northern Tukwila.\n\n"}

In place of the afterdeck a ship may be built with a poop deck, that is a deck that forms the roof of a cabin built in the rear, or \"aft\", part of the superstructure of a ship. A poop deck usually is higher up than an afterdeck. A ship may have its superstructure or aftercastle located in the stern and thus not have an afterdeck. The stern and afterdeck of a ship are usually more smooth and stable than the bow (front) of the ship in motion.\nA taffrail is the handrail around the open afterdeck or poop deck.

Her mother, Josephine, is from County Mayo in Ireland. She has a sister, Cara. She started ballet and tap classes at the age of four. She eventually quit both. She began Irish dance lessons at the age of six, which she quit promptly. \"I hated it,\" she says. \"They made me stand with my arms at my sides for two hours. So, I left. I was too young.\" She tried Irish dance again at age nine, this time with a different dance teacher, Donald Golden, whom she considers to be one of the most influential people in her life. About a year into Irish dance, she became very serious with it and quit the soccer and baseball teams. From a young age, she competed in regional, national and international championships.

This cold current mixes with the tropical Brazil Current in the Argentine Sea (see Brazil–Falkland Confluence), giving it its temperate climate. \n\nThe current is an equatorward flowing current that carries cold and relatively fresh subantarctic water. The Falkland Current is a branch of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. It transports between 60 and 90 Sverdrups of water with speeds ranging from a half a meter to a meter per second. Hydrographic data in this area is very scarce and thus various hydrographic variables have a great deal of error.

Cooked meat can be added to cheese sandwiches, such as the ham and cheese sandwich and the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich.\n\nCheese sandwiches can be grilled or fried so that the bread toasts and the cheese melts (a dish referred to as a \"grilled cheese\" sandwich, or simply grilled cheese). A grilled cheese is often heated by placing the buttered slices of bread, with the cheese between the slices, on a frying pan or griddle. Another variation of a grilled cheese sandwich is to melt and fry cheese on the outside of the bread as well as melting the cheese inside the two slices of bread. When this is done, it produces a crunchy fried cheese exterior to the sandwich. \n\nAnother form of cooked cheese sandwich is the \"cheese toastie\" or \"toastie,\" a dish particularly popular in the United Kingdom that is prepared by either baking or grilling a cheese sandwich in an oven, or toasting bag in an electric toaster, or using a pie iron in order to toast the bread and melt the cheese.

Based on a 1915 patent by firearms designer John Browning for a shotgun initially marketed as the Remington Model 17, it utilizes a novel combination ejection/loading port on the bottom of the gun which leaves the sides closed to the elements. Since shotshells load and eject from the bottom, operation of the gun is equally convenient for both right- and left-handed shooters. This makes the gun popular with left-handed shooters.\n\nFollowing the First World War, the Ithaca Gun Company sought to produce a pump-action shotgun to compete with the ubiquitous Winchester Model 1912. They used the Remington Model 17 as their model and made modifications—such as simplifying and cost-saving alterations of the firing pin and ejection mechanism, the work of Ithaca designer Harry Howland in 1931—while waiting for related patents to expire. After gearing for production of their new shotgun as the Ithaca Model 33 in 1933, Ithaca discovered a Pedersen patent that would not expire until 1937, and production had to be delayed. In 1937, it was released as the Ithaca 37.\n\nWith the depression dragging on and war looming on the horizon, it was possibly the worst time to introduce a sporting arm. Many sporting arms ceased production entirely during the same period. While Ithaca did produce some shotguns for military use during the war, they also produced M1911 pistols and M3 submachine guns.\n\nAfter World War II, Ithaca resumed production of the Model 37. Made in many different models, the Ithaca 37 has the longest production run for a pump-action shotgun in history, surpassing that of the Winchester Model 12, the original inspiration for Ithaca's entry into the market. Ithaca has suffered many setbacks in its history and changed hands numerous times. At one time, the Ithaca 37 was renamed the Model 87, although it was soon changed back in one of many ownership changes. Production paused in 2005 when Ithaca once again changed hands. Production has resumed in Upper Sandusky, Ohio.\n\nAccording to an article by the Ithaca Times dated June 11th, 2003, the one-millionth Model 37 was produced in 1968; and as of 2003, more than 2,000,000 Model 37s have been produced. The Ithaca 37 is the only pre–World War II shotgun still in production.\n\nThe Model 37 was used by the United States armed forces in World War II, the Korean War, and especially the Vietnam War, where it gained a great reputation for reliability in the jungles of Vietnam. \nThe largest single users outside the US Military were the New York City Police Department and the Los Angeles Police Department. The New York City Police Department used two versions of the Model 37: one with a 13\" barrel with forend hand-strap for its Emergency Service Unit and one with an 18\" barrel for its Highway Patrol and solo patrol officers of designated low-crime precincts through a short-lived program spanning from the late 1970s to early 1980s. The Model 37 was issued by the LAPD beginning in the 1940s and remained in service until the late 1990s. Other users include the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and various military, police, and security agencies and prisons around the world. The Ithaca 37 remains a popular choice among civilians for both sport and personal protection. The Model 37 Featherlight has commonly been seen in the hands of farmers and hunters in the midwestern United States.\n\nLoading the Ithaca 37 involves inserting shotshells of the proper gauge through the loading/ejection port in the bottom of the receiver and pushing them forward into the magazine until retained by the shell stop. The slide release is pressed and the slide retracted completely then pushed forward.\nPulling the trigger fires the gun and releases the slide for reloading. On most models up to 1975, a second sear was installed that would drop the hammer as soon the gun went into battery if the trigger was in a depressed condition. Thus, holding the trigger down allowed the gun to fire the instant a new round is cycled into the chamber without requiring the trigger to be released; this feature was called \"slam-fire.\" Otherwise, the Model 37 operates in much the same way as other pump-action shotguns.\n\n\nAn unlicensed, near identical copy known as the Bataan Modelo 71 is manufactured by the Argentinian firm Industrias Marcati.\n\n\n"}

The Brazil Current begins at about 10–15˚S where the South Equatorial Current (SEC) splits near Cabo de São Roque, Brazil. The current reaches a depth of 700 m and the estimated transport at 12˚S is 2.5 Sv.\n\nThe transport increases as the current goes further south with 4 Sv at 15˚S. On the offshore side of the current an anticyclonic recirculation gyre at about 30˚S causes an increase of the Brazil Current’s transport. The estimated southward transport at 27˚S, 31˚S, 34˚S, and 36˚S are 11 Sv, 17 Sv, 22 Sv, and 41 Sv. The total transport can be from 70 to 80 Sv by 36˚S with half of it being in the recirculation gyre. The Brazil Current is a part of the South Atlantic subtropical gyre. The southern side of the gyre consists of the eastward-flowing South Atlantic Current (SAC). The eastern boundary is the Benguela Current System (BCS). The north side consists of the SEC, which flows west and then splits with the north water becoming the North Brazil Current (NBC). The southern-flowing waters become the Brazil Current, which makes up the western boundary. It is a western boundary current like the Gulf Stream, and is its southern counterpart; however, it is considerably shallower and weaker. It flows south from the equator to the west wind drift. It joins the Falkland Current (Malvinas Current) at the Argentine Sea (see Brazil–Falkland Confluence), making it a temperate sea. The Brazil-Falkland Confluence is where the Brazil Current begins to separate from the coast at about 36˚S and is where the saltier subtropical water of the Brazil Current meets the fresher subantarctic water of the Falkland Current. The main transport of the current leaves the continental shelf at about 38˚S and the sea surface temperature at that latitude is estimated to be about 16–18˚C, although the latitude where the current separates from the coast has been thought to be farther north from July to September than from January to March. If the Falkland Current has low transport then the path of the Brazil Current is dominated by wind stress curl. However, if the Falkland Current transport is increased then the Brazil Current separates from the coast at the observed 38˚S latitude. The range of sea surface temperature and the salinity for the Brazil-Falkland Confluence is 7–18˚C and 33.6–36 psu. The Brazil Current region also contains six major water masses within the system: Upper Circumpolar Water (UCPW), Lower Circumpolar Water (LCPW), Central Water (CW), Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW).\n\n"}

Killed with her was a nun who had accompanied her - Varvara Yakovleva.\n\nThe bodies were recovered from the mine by the White Army in September 1918. The bodies were placed in coffins and despite the struggles between the Whites and the opposing Red Army, they were moved to the far east.

Highly favoured by Liu Shan, he was commonly blamed for misguiding the latter into surrendering to Shu's rival state, Cao Wei, in 263 during the Wei invasion of Shu.\n\nHuang Hao entered the Shu imperial palace sometime in the 220s as a eunuch attending to the Shu emperor Liu Shan, who favoured him because he was shrewd and full of flattering words. Whenever Huang Hao attempted to interfere in state affairs, Dong Yun, then the head of government, warned Liu Shan about the dangers of flattery and admonished Huang Hao for misleading the emperor. When Dong Yun was still alive, he kept Huang Hao in check and never allowed him to be promoted beyond the position of an Assistant of the Yellow Gate (黃門丞).\n\nFollowing Dong Yun's death in 246, Chen Zhi replaced him as the head of government and collaborated with Huang Hao to dominate the imperial court and state affairs. During this time, Liu Shan also criticised the late Dong Yun for treating him with contempt; he was believed to have said this under the influence of Huang Hao and Chen Zhi. When Chen Zhi died in 258, Huang Hao became the most influential figure in the Shu central government Chengdu. Liu Shan also promoted him to the positions of Central Regular Attendant (中常侍) and Commandant of Equippage (奉車都尉).\n\nHuang Hao abused his power by promoting officials who flattered him and demoting those who refused to fawn on him. When Luo Xian refused to associate with him, he had Luo Xian sent out of Chengdu to serve as the Administrator (太守) of Badong Commandery (巴東郡; around present-day Fengjie County, Chongqing). Yan Yu (閻宇), a close friend of Huang Hao, was appointed as Luo Xian's deputy to watch over him. Fan Jian, the Prefect of the Masters of Writing (尚書令), refused to have any dealings with Huang Hao. Huang Hao disliked Xi Zheng, an official who had been neighbours with him for about 30 years, so although he did not harm Xi Zheng, he never allowed Xi Zheng to get promoted. Liu Yong, a younger brother of Liu Shan, hated Huang Hao and was never on good terms with him. After Huang Hao came to power, he slandered and spoke ill of Liu Yong in front of Liu Shan, resulting in Liu Shan refusing to meet Liu Yong for more than 10 years.\n\nIn 262, the Shu general Jiang Wei wrote to Liu Shan to urge him to execute Huang Hao. However, Liu Shan refused, said that Huang Hao were merely a servant running errands for him, and told Jiang Wei to not take it too personally. Jiang Wei knew that Huang Hao had many supporters in the imperial court and became worried that he might have gotten himself into trouble when he asked Liu Shan to execute Huang Hao. Later, Liu Shan ordered Huang Hao to apologise to Jiang Wei. Jiang Wei found an excuse to leave Chengdu and move to a military garrison at Tazhong (沓中; northwest of present-day Zhugqu County, Gansu). In the meantime, Huang Hao came up an idea to remove Jiang Wei from his command and replace him with Yan Yu (閻宇), his close friend. When Jiang Wei heard about it, he remained in Tazhong and refused to return to Chengdu as he knew that he would be safe in Tazhong.\n\nIn 263, Jiang Wei received news that Zhong Hui, a general from Shu's rival state Wei, was mobilising troops into the Guanzhong region, seemingly in preparation for an invasion of Shu. He then wrote to Liu Shan, requesting permission to set up defences against the impending invasion. Huang Hao, who believed in sorcery, got a witch doctor to predict the future. He then told Liu Shan that the witch doctor predicted that the Wei forces would not attack Shu, so there was no need to follow Jiang Wei's plan. Later that year, the Wei general Deng Ai led his troops through a shortcut across mountainous terrain, bypassed the Shu defences, and showed up outside Chengdu. Liu Shan surrendered without putting up a fight, thus bringing an end to the Shu regime's existence. After Liu Shan's surrender, Deng Ai heard that Huang Hao was a treacherous person and wanted to execute him, but Huang Hao had already bribed Deng Ai's men to release him and escaped. His eventual fate is unknown.\n\nIn Chapter 119 of the 14th-century historical novel \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\", Huang Hao is publicly executed at the order of the Wei regent Sima Zhao when he followed Liu Shan to the Wei capital Luoyang.\n\n\n"}

His service under Niu Fu ended in 192 following Dong Zhuo's death and Niu Fu's assassination by his subordinate Huchi'er (胡赤兒).\n\nIn 195, Emperor Xian managed to escape from the generals Li Jue and Guo Si, who had been holding him hostage in Chang'an since 192, and return to the old imperial capital, Luoyang. Dong Cheng, Zhang Yang, Yang Feng, the White Wave Bandits and other loyalists came to protect the emperor from Li Jue and Guo Si, who attempted to capture him and bring him back to Chang'an.\n\nAfter Emperor Xian and the loyalists reached Luoyang, internal conflict broke out between Dong Cheng and Yang Feng, who had support from the White Wave Bandits. Dong Cheng then chose to ally with the warlord Cao Cao. When Cao Cao showed up in Luoyang with his forces, Dong Cheng reported Han Xian and Yang Feng's wrongdoings to Emperor Xian and forced them to leave. Cao Cao then received Emperor Xian and escorted him to his own base in Xu (許; in present-day Xuchang, Henan), which became the new imperial capital.\n\nAs Emperor Xian feared that Cao Cao would attempt to dominate him and the central government and use him as a \"trump card\" against rival warlords, in 199 he appointed Dong Cheng as General of Chariots and Cavalry (車騎將軍) to balance against Cao Cao's influence in the imperial court. The emperor also gave Dong Cheng permission to open his own office and have his own staff – in the same way as Cao Cao did. Dong Cheng's daughter also became a concubine of Emperor Xian.\n\nIn the year 200, Dong Cheng allegedly received a secret imperial edict from Emperor Xian ordering him to eliminate Cao Cao, so he contacted a few officials and plotted with them to assassinate Cao Cao. These officials included Zhong Ji (种輯), Wang Zifu (王子服), Wu Zilan (吳子蘭) and Liu Bei. However, Cao Cao caught wind of their plot and had them arrested. He then charged them with treason and had all of them (except Liu Bei, who had already fled) executed along with their families.

He married Princess Qinghe, one of Cao Cao's daughters, and held the title of a marquis.\n\nXiahou Mao was a close friend of Cao Pi, Cao Cao's heir and the first emperor of Cao Wei. After Cao Pi usurped the throne from Emperor Xian (the last emperor of the Han dynasty) in 220, he appointed Xiahou Mao as General Who Stabilises the West (安西將軍) and put him in charge of military affairs in the Guanzhong region, with his headquarters at Chang'an (present-day Xi'an, Shaanxi). According to the \"Weilue\", Xiahou Mao was known for being an incompetent military commander – such that Wei Yan, a general from Cao Wei's rival state Shu Han, once attempted to exploit Xiahou Mao's incompetence by sending an army across harsh terrain to launch a sneak attack on Chang'an. However, the plan did not go through because Zhuge Liang, the Chancellor of Shu, rejected Wei Yan's plan.\nIn 228, the second Wei emperor, Cao Rui, personally led reinforcements to Chang'an to defend against a series of invasions by Shu forces under Zhuge Liang's leadership.

The three of them slandered him in front of the emperor Cao Rui and caused him to be arrested and almost executed. However, Xiahou Mao was saved by Duan Mo (段默), an official who urged Cao Rui to further investigate the allegations. Cao Rui listened to him and eventually found Xiahou Mao to be innocent, so he released Xiahou Mao and restored him as a Master of Writing.\n\nSome time later in Cao Rui's reign, Xiahou Mao was appointed as General Who Guards the East (鎮東將軍). It is not known when he died.\n\nXiahou Mao's supposed impotence was dramatised in the 14th-century historical novel \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\". When he was assigned to defend the Wei-Shu border, he was not well respected by his colleagues, who assumed that Xiahou Mao would be unable to fulfil his role. Xiahou Mao reportedly responded to such criticism as follows: \n\nHis early encounter against Shu turned out badly, and he was forced to flee. After consulting with his generals, he planned a successful ambush against the Shu general Zhao Yun and duelled him for over 50 rounds. Unfortunately for Xiahou Mao, this victory was only temporary, as Shu generals Zhang Bao and Guan Xing both arrived with 10,000 troops to save Zhao Yun; Xiahou Mao's army was utterly routed by nightfall. Xiahou Mao escaped to Nan'an Commandery with just 100 horsemen. He managed to resist a siege for ten days until Zhuge Liang arrived and directed his efforts towards Tianshui Commandery. Cui Liang, a defeated Wei officer who was en route to Tianshui, offered Zhuge Liang to convince the governor of Nan'an, Yang Ling, to turn the city over. In fact, he had no such intention, instead telling Yang Ling what had taken place, and the two of them and Xiahou Mao attempted to lure the Shu army into the city and destroy them.\n\nZhuge Liang saw through the plot and turned it against them. Both Cui Liang and Yang Ling were slain by Zhang Bao and Guan Xing respectively, and Xiahou Mao was captured. He begged for his life and was released by Zhuge Liang on the condition that he convinces Jiang Wei to defect to Shu. In fact, Xiahou Mao was simply being played a fool, and was tricked into thinking that Jiang Wei had already defected. He went to Tianshui Commandery to meet Ma Zun (馬遵), the commandery's Administrator, and his false belief of Jiang Wei's defection was reinforced when a fake Jiang Wei led troops to attack Tianshui. He was driven off, and so was the real Jiang Wei when he came to Tianshui later. Due to the later defection of Jiang Wei and the betrayal of Liang Xu (梁緒) and Yin Shang (尹賞) (friends of Jiang Wei), Tianshui fell to Shu forces. Xiahou Mao fled with a few hundred loyalists and sought refuge with the Qiang tribes, and, staying true to his words, never returned.\n\n\n"}

(It might help to think of a perfect gas as a special case of a perfect fluid.) In cosmology, fluid solutions are often used as cosmological models.\n\nThe stress–energy tensor of a relativistic fluid can be written in the form\nHere\nThe heat flux vector and viscous shear tensor are \"transverse\" to the world lines, in the sense that\nThis means that they are effectively three-dimensional quantities, and since the viscous stress tensor is symmetric and traceless, they have respectively three and five linearly independent components. Together with the density and pressure, this makes a total of 10 linearly independent components, which is the number of linearly independent components in a four-dimensional symmetric rank two tensor.\n\nSeveral special cases of fluid solutions are noteworthy (here speed of light \"c\" = 1):\nThe last two are often used as cosmological models for (respectively) matter-dominated and radiation-dominated epochs. Notice that while in general it requires ten functions to specify a fluid, a perfect fluid requires only two, and dusts and radiation fluids each require only one function. It is much easier to find such solutions than it is to find a general fluid solution.\n\nAmong the perfect fluids other than dusts or radiation fluids, by far the most important special case is that of the static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions. These can always be matched to a Schwarzschild vacuum across a spherical surface, so they can be used as interior solutions in a stellar model. In such models, the sphere formula_14 where the fluid interior is matched to the vacuum exterior is the surface of the star, and the pressure must vanish in the limit as the radius approaches formula_15. However, the density can be nonzero in the limit from below, while of course it is zero in the limit from above. In recent years, several surprisingly simple schemes have been given for obtaining \"all\" these solutions.\n\nThe components of a tensor computed with respect to a frame field rather than the coordinate basis are often called \"physical components\", because these are the components which can (in principle) be measured by an observer.\n\nIn the special case of a \"perfect fluid\", an \"adapted frame\"\ncan always be found in which the Einstein tensor takes the simple form\nwhere formula_5 is the \"energy density\" and formula_6 is the \"pressure\" of the fluid. Here, the timelike unit vector field formula_20 is everywhere tangent to the world lines of observers who are comoving with the fluid elements, so the density and pressure just mentioned are those measured by comoving observers. These are the same quantities which appear in the general coordinate basis expression given in the preceding section; to see this, just put formula_21. From the form of the physical components, it is easy to see that the isotropy group of any perfect fluid is isomorphic to the three dimensional Lie group SO(3), the ordinary rotation group.\n\nThe fact that these results are exactly the same for curved spacetimes as for hydrodynamics in flat Minkowski spacetime is an expression of the equivalence principle.\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of the Einstein tensor in a perfect fluid must have the form\nwhere formula_23 are again the density and pressure of the fluid as measured by observers comoving with the fluid elements. (Notice that these quantities can \"vary\" within the fluid.) Writing this out and applying Gröbner basis methods to simplify the resulting algebraic relations, we find that the coefficients of the characteristic must satisfy the following two algebraically independent (and invariant) conditions:\nBut according to Newton's identities, the traces of the powers of the Einstein tensor are related to these coefficients as follows:\nso we can rewrite the above two quantities entirely in terms of the traces of the powers. These are obviously scalar invariants, and they must vanish identically in the case of a perfect fluid solution:\nNotice that this assumes nothing about any possible equation of state relating the pressure and density of the fluid; we assume only that we have one simple and one triple eigenvalue.\n\nIn the case of a dust solution (vanishing pressure), these conditions simplify considerably:\nor\nIn tensor gymnastics notation, this can be written using the Ricci scalar as:\n\nIn the case of a radiation fluid, the criteria become\nor\nIn using these criteria, one must be careful to ensure that the largest eigenvalue belongs to a \"timelike\" eigenvector, since there are Lorentzian manifolds, satisfying this eigenvalue criterion, in which the large eigenvalue belongs to a \"spacelike\" eigenvector, and these cannot represent radiation fluids.\n\nThe coefficients of the characteristic will often appear very complicated, and the traces are not much better; when looking for solutions it is almost always better to compute components of the Einstein tensor with respect to a suitably adapted frame and then to kill appropriate combinations of components directly. However, when no adapted frame is evident, these eigenvalue criteria can be sometimes be useful, especially when employed in conjunction with other considerations.\n\nThese criteria can often be useful for spot checking alleged perfect fluid solutions, in which case the coefficients of the characteristic are often much simpler than they would be for a simpler imperfect fluid.\n\nNoteworthy individual dust solutions are listed in the article on dust solutions. Noteworthy perfect fluid solutions which feature positive pressure include various radiation fluid models from cosmology, including\n\nIn addition to the family of static spherically symmetric perfect fluids, noteworthy rotating fluid solutions include\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2316263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316263", "title": "David Cross", "text": "David Cross\n\nDavid Cross (born April 4, 1964) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, director, and writer, known primarily for his stand-up performances, the HBO sketch comedy series \"Mr. Show\" (1995–1999), and his role as Tobias Fünke in the sitcom \"Arrested Development\" (2003–present). Cross created, wrote, executive produced, and starred in \"The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret\" (2010–2016), developed and had a prominent role in \"Freak Show\" (2006), appeared on \"Modern Family\" (2011–2012) and portrayed Ian Hawke in the first three live action/CGI \"Alvin and the Chipmunks films\" (2007–2011). Cross has also done voice work for the sitcom \"Oliver Beene\" (2003–2004), and has had lead voice-over roles in the \"Kung Fu Panda\" film franchise (2008–2016), \"Megamind\" (2010) and \"Next Gen\" (2018).\n\nIn 1993, he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series for his work on \"The Ben Stiller Show\". For \"Mr. Show\", he gained three Primetime Emmy Award nominations, and for \"Arrested Development\", Cross was nominated for a Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor – Television Series, and, along with his cast, for three Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series. For his stand-up specials, he was nominated for several Grammy Awards.\n\nCross was born in Roswell, Georgia, to a Jewish family. His parents are Barry and Susi, the former of whom emigrated from Leeds, England. Six months after his birth, Cross's family moved to Florida. After additional moves to New York and Connecticut, the family settled back in Roswell, Georgia, where Cross remained for nearly a decade. His family was poor and Barry left the family when Cross was 10 years old; the two have not spoken since he was 19, though they both primarily resided in New York City until Cross sold his home there in 2011. Cross and his family were evicted from their home while living in Georgia. He spent some time living in motels and at friends' homes while growing up. He has two sisters and once bailed his youngest sibling out of jail. \n\nAt age 17, Cross began performing stand-up comedy. The day after he graduated from Northside High School in Atlanta, Cross relocated to New York City. Lacking a plan, he drifted, working briefly for a lawn care company on Long Island. Later, he enrolled at Emerson College in Boston. He would drop out after only a semester, but during his time there, Cross joined This is Pathetic, a college sketch group, where he met John Ennis. In the summer of 1985, the two aspiring actors took a road trip to Los Angeles, although this did not significantly further their acting careers. In Boston, Cross began to perform stand-up more regularly. From the mid-1980s to the early 1990s, Boston had a booming comedy scene, although Cross did not fit the types of acts being booked most of the time. He recalls that it was \"a loud, dumb, pandering, racist, homophobic-type scene\".\n\nIn 1990, a new comedy scene began to emerge at the comedy club chain Catch a Rising Star. Alongside Janeane Garofalo, Louis C.K., and other comics, Cross appeared regularly several nights a week. Cross formed the sketch comedy group \"Cross Comedy\" with 12 other performers, and they put on a new show every week. They were known for playing tricks on the audience, such as introducing fake comics or planting fake hecklers. Cross became increasingly focused on his comedy work.\n\nCross later performed at the alternative comedy club Un-Cabaret in Los Angeles, where radio artist Joe Frank heard him, and hired him to appear in Frank's 1994 radio programs, \"A Hearing\" and \"The Last Run\" (in 1997 combined to become \"The OJ Chronicles\"), where Cross appears as OJ's valet. Cross also starred in the Joe Frank program \"Jam\", produced in 1999, and has more recently worked with Joe Frank on radio shows for KCRW's \"Unfictional\".\n\nCross's stand-up comedy blends political commentary and satire. In 1999, he performed a one-hour comedy special, \"The Pride Is Back\", on HBO. He has released three recordings: \"Shut Up You Fucking Baby!\", \"It's Not Funny\", and \"Bigger and Blackerer\". Cross's stand up material was featured in Comedy Central's animated series Shorties Watchin' Shorties. In 2004, \"Shut Up You Fucking Baby!\" was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. In 2003, he released his first tour film \"Let America Laugh\" and was named #85 on Comedy Central's list of the 100 greatest stand-ups of all time. He appears on Un-Cabaret compilation albums, including \"Freak Weather Feels Different\" and \"The Good, the Bad and the Drugly\".\n\nCross announced a 51-date nationwide stand-up tour from Jan. 26, 2016, in San Diego through April 24, 2016, in Oklahoma City. Titled \"Making America Great Again!\", it was his first tour in six years.\n\nCross began his professional television career as a writer on \"The Ben Stiller Show\". The series hired him toward the end of its run, and he occasionally made brief appearances in the sketches. He had a speaking role in \"The Legend of T.J. O'Pootertoot\", a sketch written almost entirely by Cross. It was during this period that he first met Bob Odenkirk, with whom he would later co-create the HBO sketch comedy series \"Mr. Show\" in 1995. Cross won an Emmy for his work on \"The Ben Stiller Show\" in 1993. In 1997 he played Newton, an employee of the NYC Morgue in \"Men in Black\", and reprised the character, now as an owner of a video rental store, in \"Men in Black II\" in 2002.\n\nCross later co-starred as Tobias Fünke in \"Arrested Development\", originally intended to be only a minor role. He also played smaller roles on programs such as \"Just Shoot Me!\", \"The Drew Carey Show\", \"NewsRadio\", \"Strangers with Candy\",\" Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job\", and \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\". From October 2005, Cross regularly appeared on Comedy Central's \"The Colbert Report\" as Stephen Colbert's nemesis Russ Lieber, a fictional liberal radio talk show host from Madison, Wisconsin. Cross developed an animated series for Comedy Central called \"Freak Show\", which co-starred H. Jon Benjamin and was cancelled due to low ratings. He has appeared several times on \"Wonder Showzen\".\n\nCross teamed up with \"Mr. Show\" director and producer Troy Miller and Odenkirk to produce a feature film \"Run Ronnie Run\", based on one of their \"Mr. Show\" characters. The film satirized the reality television craze, and featured cameos from many stars; however, Odenkirk got into conflict with the studio New Line Cinema, and they released it direct-to-video. In 1994 and again in 1999, Cross was a guest voice actor on Joe Frank's radio show, featured in the episodes \"The Last Run\", \"A Hearing\", \"The O.J. Chronicles\", and \"Jam\". In 2013, he returned, making an appearance in an episode of Frank's radio show, entitled \"A Conversation.\"\n\nIn 2004, Cross provided voices for a Marine in \"Halo 2\" and a store clerk named in \"\". He was also the voice of the \"Happy-Time Harry\" doll and Bert Banana in \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\" (although the part was credited as Sir Willups Brightslymoore). Cross has made guest appearances in \"Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!\". He directed the music video for The Black Keys' song \"10 A.M. Automatic\", a spoof of public-access television. \"Paste Magazine\" ranked it number 24 on their list of the 50 Best Music Videos of the Decade (2000–2009).\n\nCross appeared in The Strokes' music video for \"Juicebox\" as a bad local \"morning zoo\" radio DJ. He also appeared in The New Pornographers' video for \"Use It\", in Superchunk's video for \"Watery Hands\" (along with Janeane Garofalo), and in Yo La Tengo's video for \"Sugarcube\" (along with Bob Odenkirk and John Ennis). Cross contributes to \"Vice\" magazine, writing a column, \"My America\". In 2005, he contributed to the UNICEF benefit song \"Do They Know It's Hallowe'en?\" and appeared in one of PETA's \"I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur\" campaigns.\n\nIn the Beastie Boys' 2006 concert film \"Awesome; I Fuckin' Shot That!\", Cross portrays Nathaniel Hörnblowér in the fictional segment \"A Day in the Life of Nathaniel Hörnblowér\". In \"I'm Not There\", Cross portrays Allen Ginsberg. Both Bill Lawrence and Zach Braff of the TV series \"Scrubs\" were eager to have Cross make a cameo appearance on the series as Tobias Fünke, but due to the series' cancellation, the plan never came to fruition.\n\nCross provided commentary on the \"Vicarious\" music video DVD for Tool. He has previously performed comedy as an opening act for the band and its members appeared on \"Mr. Show\" several times. He portrayed Ian Hawke in \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\", \"\", and \"\" and voiced Crane in the \"Kung Fu Panda\" film franchise.\n\nCross starred in \"David's Situation\", a pilot for HBO. It filmed in May 2008 and included many \"Mr. Show\" alumni at the taping. On August 6, 2008, Bob Odenkirk announced on bobanddavid.com that \"David's Situation\" would not be produced.\nCross's black comedy series \"The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret\", in which he stars and co-writes with Shaun Pye, has run on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom and IFC in the United States since October 2010, for a total 18 episodes. On March 29, 2010, his first comedy special in six years, \"Bigger and Blackerer\", was streamed on Epix HD. A CD with \"slightly different content\" was released on May 25, 2010.\n\nIn 2009, Cross released his first book \"I Drink for a Reason\". The book features memoirs, satirical fictional memoirs, and material from Cross that originally appeared in other publications. In September 2009, Cross performed at his own comedy stage at the ATP New York 2009 music festival, for which he picked Eugene Mirman, H. Jon Benjamin, Jon Glaser, and Derrick Brown & The Navy Gravy to join him. In the same year, Cross and Benjamin created and wrote for \"Paid Programming\" on Adult Swim. \"Paid Programming\" was not picked up for a full series and Benjamin referred to it as an \"abject failure\".\n\nCross starred alongside Julia Stiles and America Ferrera in \"It's a Disaster\", which premiered at the 2012 Los Angeles Film Festival. Oscilloscope Laboratories acquired US distribution rights to the film, releasing it in select theaters beginning April 13, 2013.\n\nCross's directorial debut film \"Hits\" premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. Instead of selling the film rights to distributors, Cross instead opted to sell the movie over Bit Torrent through their \"bundles\" program, which BitTorrent launched to help \"legitimize\" the platform. According to \"The Verge\", it was the first feature film to be distributed in such a format. At the same time, Cross launched a Kickstarter campaign for the movie's general release which would then distribute the movie using a pay what you want methodology.\n\nIn April 2015, episodes were ordered for a new sketch comedy show starring Cross and Odenkirk called \"W/ Bob & David\". It premiered in November 2015 on Netflix. Cross and Odenkirk write, star in, and produce the show.\n\nOn the January 10, 2016, broadcast of the National Public Radio-syndicated quiz show \"Ask Me Another\", Cross appeared as a celebrity guest and performed well enough that at the audience's request the show's producers took the unusual step of allowing him to advance to the show's final, championship round; he then won that round and became that episode's overall champion, winning a prize package that included a pair of denim cutoff shorts that he himself had autographed.\n\nHe created the eight-episode black comedy series \"Bliss\", which was released by the BritBox streaming service in 2018. It stars Stephen Mangan as Andrew, a fraudulent travel writer, who is struggling to maintain long-term relationships with two partners, Kim (Heather Graham) and Denise (Jo Hartley), who are not aware of one another. The same year Cross provided the lead character's \"white voice\" in the science fiction comedy film \"Sorry to Bother You\",\n\nCross has said his comedic influences include Bill Hicks, Andy Kaufman, \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\", Lou Costello, Steven Wright, Richard Pryor, and Lenny Bruce.\n\nIn October 2005, Cross was sued by Nashville club manager Thomas Weber, who accused Cross of taping him without permission for \"Shut Up You Fucking Baby\" and \"Let America Laugh\" in violation of Weber's privacy rights. In April 2006, the case against Cross himself was dismissed and the case proceeded with Warner Music, Subpop Records, WEA Corporation, and the Alternative Distribution Alliance.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with \"Playboy\" magazine, Cross revealed that he had snorted a small amount of cocaine at the 2009 White House Correspondents' Dinner. Cross said, \"It wasn’t like I got high...It was just about being able to say that I did it, that I did cocaine in the same room as the president.\"\n\nOn August 18, 2018, Cross tweeted a photo of himself wearing sacred Latter Day Saint (Mormon) undergarments. The tweet was meant to promote his show at Kingsbury Hall in Salt Lake City, Utah. He faced criticism from LDS Church members who claim the photo was offensive to their religion and asked that the show be cancelled. Ruth V. Watkins, President of the University of Utah where Kingsbury Hall is located released the following statement: “The University of Utah condemns bigotry and religious intolerance in any form. The offensive use of sacred religious imagery in a tweet by David Cross promoting his performance at Kingsbury Hall was in opposition to the university’s values of respect and inclusivity. The use of the imagery was deeply offensive. At the same time, the First Amendment protects such speech, and the university cannot and will not censor content of those coming to campus. We acknowledge the free speech rights of individuals and entities who rent university facilities—even those with whom we disagree. By doing so, we protect the free speech rights of all.”\n\nIn April 2005, Cross criticized stand-up comedian Larry the Cable Guy in a \"Rolling Stone\" interview, saying, \"It's a lot of anti-gay, racist humor—which people like in America—all couched in 'I'm telling it like it is.' He's in the right place at the right time for that gee-shucks, proud-to-be-a-redneck, I'm-just-a-straight-shooter-multimillionaire-in-cutoff-flannel-selling-ring-tones act. That's where we are as a nation now. We're in a state of vague American values and anti-intellectual pride.\"\n\nIn response, Larry devoted a chapter in his book \"GIT-R-DONE\" to Cross and the \"PC left\", claiming that Cross had \"screwed with my fans, it was time for me to say something\". Larry claimed that \"Rolling Stone\" was baiting comedians to attack him, and they turned to Cross only after Lewis Black refused; as Larry and Black are good friends. Cross responded with \"An Open Letter to Larry the Cable Guy\" posted on his website. He continued to mock Larry in his stand-up, satirizing \"Blue Collar TV\" during a guest appearance on \"Wonder Showzen\". In December 2005, he ended his performance on Comedy Central's \"Last Laugh '05\" by mockingly yelling Larry's catchphrase, \"GIT-R-DONE!\", to the audience as he left the stage. He pokes fun at Larry's comedy in \"Freak Show\" with a character called \"Danny the Plumber Guy\".\n\nCross has criticized \"Inside the Actors Studio\" host James Lipton on a \"Mr. Show\" sketch and in his stand-up performance \"The Pride Is Back\", calling him \"pretentious.\" Lipton, who thought that Cross's impression of him was not good-natured, would later appear alongside Cross in \"Arrested Development\", in the recurring role of Prison Warden Stefan Gentiles. During filming, Cross was impressed with Lipton's acting and comedic ability, and the two became good friends. On one commentary track for season four of \"Mr. Show\", Cross discussed the encounter, complimenting Lipton for his professionalism and performance, saying that he liked Lipton personally but still \"didn't care for\" \"Inside The Actors Studio\".\n\nResponding to critics of his decision to appear in the critically panned, but commercially successful, \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\", Cross noted that the film paid for a summer cottage, and more than \"all my other projects combined: book, TV show, the two pilots, \"Year One\", yeah.\" Although he has admitted to taking the role primarily for the money, he has said that he does not regret doing so or consider it to be \"selling out\" as he has nothing against entertainment designed for children to enjoy that does not send a bad message. Cross reprised his \"Chipmunks\" role in the film's two sequels, \"\" and \"\".\n\nCross has been critical of several pop music acts in his standup comedy, notably Creed and its lead singer, Scott Stapp. On his 2004 album \"It's Not Funny\", Cross referred to Creed as \"the third-worst band in history”, and maligned the group's pop sensibilities for being too ubiquitous, suggesting that Stapp hung around \"10th grade girls' locker rooms\" to find inspiration for his song lyrics. Cross then relates an anecdote about Stapp being a last-minute replacement for another celebrity at a taping of \"Celebrity Poker Showdown\" in 2003. Cross became concerned that a confrontation would take place since he had \"said the most awful shit about that guy [Stapp] on stage and in print.\" Cross said that as the taping was preparing to commence, he approached Stapp and extended his hand, introducing himself, and that Stapp shook his hand and sarcastically intoned, \"Thanks for the words”, to which Cross replied, \"Well, you know...\"\n\nIn August 2011, after four years of dating, Cross became engaged to Amber Tamblyn. They married in 2012. On February 21, 2017, Tamblyn announced that she and Cross had recently had a daughter.\n\nCross, who was raised Jewish, has described himself as atheist.\n\nHe describes his political philosophy as \"definitely more socialist Democrat than centrist politician\". In an interview in 2016, Cross praised Senator Bernie Sanders and said he admired Sanders \"way before he ran for President\".\n\nOn September 26, 2013, Kickstarter co-founder Yancey Strickler revealed that Cross was the first investor in the crowdfunding platform. Strickler included Cross among the \"friends and family\" who first financed Kickstarter in 2006.\n\n"}
{"id": "2316267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316267", "title": "Bernhard Crusell", "text": "Bernhard Crusell\n\nBernhard Henrik Crusell (15 October 1775 – 28 July 1838) was a Swedish-Finnish clarinetist, composer and translator, \"the most significant and internationally best-known Finnish-born classical composer and indeed, — the outstanding Finnish composer before Sibelius\".\n\nCrusell was born in Uusikaupunki (Swedish: Nystad), Finland, into a poor family of bookbinders. His grandfather, Bernhard Kruselius had learned the trade of bookbinding in Turku and Stockholm, then settled in Pori where he fathered nine children, including Crusell's father Jakob, who also became a bookbinder. In 1765, after Jakob completed his apprenticeship, he moved to Uusikaupunki and married Helena Ylander, but she died about one year later. In 1769 he married Margaretha Messman. The couple had four children, but Bernhard was the only one who lived to become an adult. Later in life Crusell described this period of his life, writing in the third person:\n\nIn his little town of birth there was only one person who had an active interest in music: a shop assistant who could be heard in the evenings playing the flute for his own amusement. One night, the four-year-old Berndt was sitting in the street, leaning against a wall, on top of the world with admiration for the sweet melodies. His parents, who had been looking for their son for a long time, scolded him severely, but this could not stop the boy from returning to his favourite spot the next evening. This time he got a beating for his disobedience, but as it was to no avail, they left him to his \"craze\", confident that he would come back home as soon as the flute went silent...\nWhen Crusell was eight, the family moved to Perttula, the rural village of Nurmijärvi about 23 miles north of Helsinki. His innate interest in music continued, and he learned to play a friend's clarinet by ear. He soon began to receive training from a member of the Nyland regimental band.\n\nIn 1788, when he was thirteen, another family friend, aware of the young man's natural ability, took him to see Major O. Wallenstjerna at Sveaborg (). Sveaborg was a Swedish fortress built on six islands just off the coast of Helsinki. The educated officers of the fort had significant influence on the culture and politics of the city. Wallenstjerna, impressed with Crusell's playing, recruited him as a volunteer member of the Sveaborg military band and gave him a place to live with his own family. Crusell received an education at Sveaborg and excelled in music and languages. In 1791 Wallenstjerna transferred to Stockholm and Crusell went with him. Although Crusell spent most of the rest of his life in Sweden, he always considered himself a Finn. In his final years in a letter to Runeberg he called himself a \"finsk landsman\" (a Finn). He also maintained his travel diaries in Finnish.\n\nIn Stockholm, Crusell continued his studies and established himself as a clarinet soloist. In 1792, at age sixteen, he received an appointment as the director of the regimental band, and in 1793 became principal clarinet with the \"Hovkapellet\" (Royal Court Orchestra), which was directed by his composition teacher, the German composer Abbé Vogler. In 1798 he received financial assistance which enabled him to live in Berlin for a few months and study with the well-known German clarinetist Franz Tausch (1762–1817). Tausch had founded the German school of clarinet playing which emphasized beauty of tone over technique. Crusell's progress was swift, and he performed at concerts in Berlin and Hamburg before returning to Sweden. The review of the Hamburg concert in the \"Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung\" was positive.\n\nCrusell lived in Sweden for the rest of his life, going back to Finland only once. After a trip to St. Petersburg, on his return trip to Sweden, he performed in Helsinki on 7 July 1801, with the pianist Fredrik Lithander as his accompanist, and in Turku on 30 July, in a concert organized by the orchestra of the Turku Society of Music.\n\nIn Stockholm Crusell had become acquainted with the French ambassador to Sweden. This friendship encouraged and enabled him to undertake a trip to Paris in 1803. There he performed and also studied clarinet with Jean-Xavier Lefèvre at the newly formed Conservatoire. On 2 June, with the encouragement of Lefèvre, he purchased a new mouthpiece made by Michel Amlingue (1741–1816) and on 14 September a six-key C clarinet made by Jean Jacques Baumann. Before about 1800 Crusell had been playing with the reed turned up, but later turned it down, the modern practice and a position more compatible with cantabile playing. Exactly when he did this is not well established, but he may have favored the reed-above position because of a lack of evenness in his teeth.\n\nAround this time the Théâtre-Italien de Paris offered Crusell a position as first clarinetist. Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden, anxious to keep Crusell in the royal orchestra, denied a petition for an extension of leave and as a positive inducement made him chief conductor of the bodyguard regiment bands. After Crusell returned to Stockholm he remained with the Royal Court Orchestra until 1833.\n\nIn June 1811 Crusell made another trip to see Tausch in Berlin, and the two men discussed clarinets. Later that month he visited a benefactor in Leipzig, and in July he purchased a new instrument from Heinrich Grenser in Dresden. His Grenser clarinet was an advanced design for the time, with eleven keys. (A picture of Crusell's Grenser clarinet can be found here.) Later, in 1822, he again went to Dresden and purchased additional clarinets from the Grenser shop's successor, Grenser & Wiesner, and from another maker by the name of Bormann. The Stockholm Music Museum possesses five clarinets made by Grenser & Wiesner in 1822 or later, four with eleven, and one with ten keys.\n\nDuring his career Crusell became increasingly well known as a clarinet soloist, not only in Sweden but also in Germany, and even in England. He played compositions by Beethoven, Jadin, Krommer, Lebrun, Mozart, and Peter Winter, among others. Of more than 50 known concert reviews (most of which appeared in the German \"Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung\"), not even one had any negative comment. Carl Abraham Mankell (1802–1868), music critic of \"Svenska Tidningen\" (Swedish News), admired Crusell's playing for the roundness of his tone and its evenness in quality throughout the range of the instrument. Crusell was also greatly admired for his pianissimo playing. \"It is indicative of his reputation that he was for many years the best-paid musician in the court orchestra.\"\n\nBetween 1791 and 1799 Crusell studied music theory and composition with Abbé Vogler and another German teacher, Daniel Böritz, when Böritz was resident in Stockholm. In 1803 while in Paris Crusell studied composition at the Conservatoire with Gossec and Berton. He composed pieces, including concertos and chamber works, not only for his own use, but also for other wind players in the court orchestra. In 1811 he travelled to Leipzig where he established a relationship with the music publisher Bureau de Musique, which became part of C. F. Peters in 1814.\n\nFrom 1818 to 1837 during the summers he conducted military bands in Linköping, providing them with arrangements of marches and overtures by Rossini, Spohr, and Weber and composing pieces for male choir. In 1822 he published three volumes of songs to texts by the Swedish poet Tegnér and others, and in 1826 another volume, \"Frithiofs saga\", with ten songs to texts by Tegnér. An opera, \"Lilla slavinnan\" (\"The Little Slave Girl\"), was first performed in Stockholm in 1824 and was repeated 34 times in the following 14 years.\n\nCrusell was a skillful linguist, translating the important Italian, French, and German operas for performances in Sweden. His translation of Mozart's \"Le nozze di Figaro\", first performed in 1821, resulted in his induction into the Geatish Society, an association of literary academics in Sweden. In 1837 he was awarded a Gold Medal by the Swedish Academy and was inducted into the Order of Vasa, for service to the state and society. The National Library of Sweden holds two manuscript autobiographies.\n\nSince 1982 a Crusell Week has been held each summer in Uusikaupunki, Finland (Bernhard Crusell's place of birth). The festival is dedicated to music for woodwind instruments. Crusell Week’s Artistic Director is Jussi Särkkä.\n\nDates of composition and first publication and other information are from Asiado, Dahlström, and WorldCat (OCLC), unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The unofficial leader of this commune was art-historian and poet Ivan Martin Jirous. He designated the status of the community as a parallel world independent on the mainstream regime. Although being imprisoned many times, he never gave up on leading role in the movement. Among the fans of this subculture was, for example, former Czech President Václav Havel.

She was a member of the \"Bretagne\" class, alongside her two sister ships, \"Bretagne\" and \"Provence\". \"Lorraine\" was laid down in August 1912 at the \"Chantiers de Penhoët\" shipyard, launched in September 1913, and commissioned into the fleet in March 1916, after the outbreak of World War I. She was armed with a main battery of ten guns and had a top speed of .\n\n\"Lorraine\" spent the bulk of her career in the French Mediterranean Squadron. During World War I, she was stationed at Corfu to prevent the Austro-Hungarian fleet from leaving the Adriatic Sea, but she saw no action. She was modernized significantly in the 1920s and 1930s, and in 1935 her amidships 340 mm gun turret was removed and aircraft facilities were installed in its place. After the outbreak of World War II, \"Lorraine\" carried a shipment of gold from the French treasury to Bermuda before returning to operate in the Mediterranean. At the French surrender in July 1940, \"Lorraine\" was moored in Alexandria, where she was disarmed by the Royal Navy. After joining the Free French Naval Forces in December 1942, \"Lorraine\" was refitted for active service. She provided gunfire support for the landings in Operation Dragoon in August–September 1944 and bombarded German positions around La Rochelle in April 1945. After the end of the war, \"Lorraine\" was used as a gunnery training ship and then a barracks ship until late 1953, when she was stricken and sold to shipbreakers.\n\n\"Lorraine\" was long overall and had a beam of and a full-load draft of . She displaced as designed and around at full load and had a crew of between 1124 and 1133 officers and enlisted men. She was powered by four Parsons steam turbines with twenty-four Guyot du Temple water-tube boilers. They were rated at and provided a top speed of . Coal storage amounted to , which provided a range of at .\n\n\"Lorraine\"s main battery consisted of ten 340mm/45 Modèle 1912 guns mounted in five twin gun turrets, numbered from front to rear. They were placed all on the centerline; two were in a superfiring pair forward, one amidships, and the last two in a superfiring arrangement aft. As completed, however, the amidships turret did not have its guns installed until January 1917. The secondary battery consisted of twenty-two Canon de 138 mm Modèle 1910 guns in casemates along the length of the hull. She also carried seven Hotchkiss guns, two on the conning tower and one on the roof of each turret. The ship was also armed with four submerged torpedo tubes.\n\nThe ship's main belt was thick and the main armored deck was thick. The main battery was protected by up to of armor on the turrets and the casemates for the secondary guns were thick. The conning tower had thick sides.\n\n\"Lorraine\" was ordered on 15 July 1912, as a replacement for the battleship \"Liberté\", which had been destroyed by a magazine explosion the previous year. She was laid down at the \"Chantiers de Penhoët\" shipyard in Saint-Nazaire on 1 August 1912 and launched on 30 September 1913. She was commissioned into the French Navy on 10 March 1916. After entering service in 1916, \"Lorraine\" and her sisters were assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Battle Squadron. The three ships remained in the unit for the remainder of the war. They spent the majority of their time at Corfu to prevent the Austro-Hungarian fleet from attempting to break out of the Adriatic. The fleet's presence was also intended to intimidate Greece, which had become increasingly hostile to the Triple Entente. Later in the war, men were drawn from their crews for anti-submarine warfare vessels. As the Austro-Hungarians largely remained in port for the duration of the war, \"Lorraine\" saw no action during the conflict. In 1917, she returned to Toulon for a periodic refit, but apart from that voyage, she saw no time at sea for the rest of the year.\n\nIn January 1919, she went to Cattaro, where she guarded the former Austro-Hungarian Navy. She assisted in repatriating Austrian naval personnel, and escorted former Austro-Hungarian warships to France and Italy; this duty lasted until March. The French Navy intended to send \"Lorraine\" and her sister \"Provence\" to the Black Sea to join operations against the Bolsheviks, but a major mutiny prevented the operation. The two ships went to Constantinople in October 1919, where they formed the core of the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron, which operated until July 1921. \"Lorraine\" underwent her first refit starting on 10 November 1921, which lasted until 4 December 1922. After emerging from refit, \"Lorraine\" was placed in reserve, due to fiscal limitations in the post-war French Navy. She returned to service the following year—1923—with the 1st Battleship Division of the Mediterranean Fleet.\n\n\"Lorraine\" was modernized a second time between 15 November 1924 and 4 August 1926. A third refit followed on 17 September 1929 and lasted until 6 June 1931. During these periods in dock, the range of the main battery was increased, the anti-aircraft battery was strengthened, and her boilers were replaced with newer, oil-fired models. Between 18 September 1934 and 20 September 1935, a fourth and final pre-war refit was carried out in Brest; \"Lorraine\"s amidships turret was removed, and an aircraft catapult along with a hangar for three aircraft were installed. The aircraft were initially Gourdou-Leseurre GL819 and Potez 452 seaplanes, though they were later replaced with Loire 130 flying boats. In 1936, \"Lorraine\" was transferred to the Atlantic Squadron, where she remained until the outbreak of World War II in September 1939.\n\nAfter the start of World War II, \"Lorraine\" served primarily in the western Mediterranean as the flagship of Force X, under Vice Admiral Godfroy. On 4 December, \"Lorraine\" operated out of Casablanca against German surface forces, along with the cruisers \"Algérie\", \"La Galissonnière\", and \"Marseillaise\", and several destroyers and submarines. During this period, she carried a shipment of gold bullion from the French treasury to Bermuda. On 1 January 1940, she was transferred to the 2nd Battleship Division of the 1st Squadron, and went into drydock for refit, which lasted until April.\n\nOn 27 April, \"Lorraine\" and her two sisters were transferred to Alexandria. On 10 June, Italy declared war on France; by that time, both \"Bretagne\" and \"Provence\" had moved back to the western Mediterranean. \"Lorraine\" was the only French capital ship in the eastern Mediterranean, though she was joined by four British battleships and an aircraft carrier. On the night of 20–21 June, \"Lorraine\" formed the center of an Anglo-French task force, with the cruisers , , and , for a bombardment of Italian positions at Bardia. The operation, which caused only minimal damage, was the last combined British and French naval operation before the French surrender.\n\nFollowing the French surrender, the French commander, Vice Admiral Godfroy, concluded an agreement with Admiral Andrew Cunningham to demilitarize and intern the French ships in Alexandria; this included \"Lorraine\", four cruisers, and three destroyers. In December 1942, the ship's crew decided to join the Allies in the Free French Naval Forces, and so \"Lorraine\" was placed back into service. On 3 July 1943, the ship left the Suez and sailed around Africa to Dakar, stopping in Cape Town on the way. After arriving on 12 October, she was used briefly as a training ship; on 2 December, \"Lorraine\" was sent to Oran for refitting. The work included removing the aircraft facilities and installing a large number of anti-aircraft guns, including eight guns, fourteen guns, and twenty-five guns. Radar equipment was also installed on the ship.\n\nThe overhaul readied \"Lorraine\" to participate in Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of southern France in August 1944. On 15 August, \"Lorraine\" joined the bombardment force, Task Force 86, that supported landings. She and the American battleship hammered German defenses in and around Toulon, including 340 mm coastal guns that had been removed from \"Provence\". The bombardment lasted until 21 August. Over the course of 1–13 September, \"Lorraine\", four cruisers, and two destroyers shelled German defenses throughout the French Riviera. Among the targets \"Lorraine\" attacked were fortresses at Sospel and Castillon, along with Axis positions around Carqueiranne and Saint-Tropez. \"Lorraine\" left the bombardment area on 17 September, but remained in the western Mediterranean until she was sent to Portsmouth for a brief refit toward the end of the year. She was then sent to Cherbourg in December.\n\nIn late March 1945, \"Lorraine\" left Cherbourg to participate in her final wartime operations, codenamed \"Vénérable\" and \"Vermeille\". In the operations, which took place in April, the French Navy focused on eliminating a pocket of German resistance in Gironde. On 14–20 April, \"Lorraine\" and several cruisers and destroyers bombarded the German \"Girond-Nord\" fortress in Royan in support of an attack by the French 10th Division and American 66th Division; the German defenders surrendered on the 20th. After completing the operation, \"Lorraine\" returned to Brest before being sent to Toulon. Starting in February 1947, she was used as a stationary gunnery training ship. Later, she was used as a barracks ship, until she was stricken from the naval register on 17 February 1953. She was sold on 18 December, to a French shipbreaking company, and towed to outside Toulon in January 1954 and broken up for scrap.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2316308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316308", "title": "USB hub", "text": "USB hub\n\nA USB hub is a device that expands a single Universal Serial Bus (USB) port into several so that there are more ports available to connect devices to a host system, similar to a power strip.\n\nUSB hubs are often built into equipment such as computer cases, keyboards, monitors, or printers. When such a device has many USB ports, they all usually stem from one or two internal USB ports rather than each port having independent USB circuitry.\n\nPhysically separate USB hubs come in a wide variety of form factors: from external boxes (looking similar to an Ethernet or network hub) connectable with a cable, to small designs that can be directly plugged into a USB port (see the \"compact design\" picture). In the middle case, there are \"short cable\" hubs which typically use an integral 6-inch cable to slightly distance a small hub away from physical port congestion and of course increase the number of available ports.\nLaptop/Notebook computers may be equipped with USB ports, but an external USB hub can consolidate several everyday devices (like a mouse and a printer) into a single hub to enable one-step attachment and removal of all the devices.\n\nSome USB hubs may support power delivery (PD) and charging if they're self-powered and certified, though they may start to be referred to as a simple docking station at this point.\n\nA USB network is built from USB hubs connected downstream to USB ports, which themselves may stem from USB hubs. USB hubs can extend a USB network to a maximum of 127 ports. The USB specification requires that bus-powered/passive hubs may not be connected in series to other bus-powered hubs.\n\nDepending on vendor and design, USB ports are often closely spaced. Consequently, plugging a device into one port may physically block an adjacent port, particularly when the plug is not part of a cable but is integral to a device such as a USB flash drive. A horizontal array of horizontal sockets may be easy to fabricate, but may cause only two out of four ports to be usable (depending on plug width).\n\nPort arrays in which the port orientation is perpendicular to the array orientation generally have fewer blockage problems. External \"Octopus\" or \"Squid\" hubs (with each socket at the end of a very short cable maybe 2 inches long), or \"star\" hubs (with each port facing in a different direction, as pictured) avoid this problem completely.\n\nUSB cables are limited to 3 metres (10 feet) for low-speed USB 1.1 devices. A hub can be used as an active USB repeater to extend cable length for up to 5 metre (16 feet) lengths at a time. Active cables (specialized connector-embedded one-port hubs) perform the same function, but since they are strictly bus-powered, externally powered (non-bus-powered) USB hubs would likely be required for some of the segments.\n\nA bus-powered hub (passive hub) is a hub that draws all its power from the host computer's USB interface. It does not need a separate power connection. However, many devices require more power than this method can provide and will not work in this type of hub. It may be desirable to use a bus-powered hub with self-powered external hard-disk units, as they may not go into sleep mode immediately upon computer shut-down or sleep mode when using a self-powered hub since they will continue to see a power source on the USB ports when using a self-powered hub.\n\nA USB's electric current is allocated in units of 100 mA up to a maximum total of 500 mA per port. Therefore, a compliant bus powered hub can have no more than four downstream ports and cannot offer more than four 100 mA units of current in total to downstream devices (since the hub needs one unit for itself). If a device requires more units of current than the port it is plugged into can supply, the operating system usually reports this to the user.\n\nIn contrast, a self-powered hub (active hub) is one that takes its power from an external power supply unit and can therefore provide full power (up to to every port. Many hubs can operate as either bus powered or self powered hubs.\n\nHowever, there are many non-compliant hubs on the market which announce themselves to the host as self-powered despite really being bus-powered. Equally there are plenty of non-compliant devices that use more than 100 mA without announcing this fact (or indeed sometimes without identifying themselves as USB devices at all). These hubs and devices do allow more flexibility in the use of power (in particular many devices use far less than 100 mA and many USB ports can supply more than 500 mA before going into overload shut-off), but they are likely to make power problems harder to diagnose.\n\nSome self-powered hubs do not supply enough power to drive a load on every port. For example, many seven port hubs have a 1A power supply, when in fact seven ports could draw a maximum of 7 x 0.5 = 3.5A, plus power for the hub itself. Designers assume the user will most likely connect many low power devices and only one or two requiring a full On the other hand, the packaging for some self-powered hubs states explicitly how many of the ports can drive a full load at once. For example, the packaging on a seven-port hub might claim to support a maximum of four full-load devices.\n\nDynamic-powered hubs are hubs which can work as bus-powered as well as self-powered hubs. They can automatically switch between modes depending on whether a separate power supply is available or not. While switching from bus-powered to self-powered operation does not necessarily require immediate renegotiations with the host, switching from self-powered to bus-powered operation may cause USB connections to be reset if connected devices previously requested more power than still available in bus-powered mode.\n\nTo allow high-speed (USB 2.0) devices to operate in their fastest mode, all hubs between the devices and the computer must be high-speed. High-speed devices should fall back to full-speed (USB 1.1) when plugged into a full-speed hub (or connected to an older full-speed computer port). While high-speed hubs can communicate at all device speeds, low- and full-speed traffic is combined and segregated from high-speed traffic through a transaction translator. Each transaction translator segregates lower speed traffic into its own pool, essentially creating a virtual full-speed bus. Some designs use a single transaction translator (STT), while other designs have multiple translators (MTT). Having multiple translators is a significant benefit when one connects multiple high-bandwidth full-speed devices.\n\nIt is an important consideration that in common language (and often product marketing), USB 2.0 is used as synonymous with high-speed. However, because the USB 2.0 specification, which introduced high-speed, incorporates the USB 1.1 specification such that a USB 2.0 device is not required to operate at high speed, any compliant full-speed or low-speed device may still be labelled as a USB 2.0 device. Thus, not all USB 2.0 hubs operate at high speed.\n\nUSB 3.0 is the third major version of the Universal Serial Bus (USB) standard for interfacing computers and electronic devices. Among other improvements, USB 3.0 adds the new transfer rate referred to as \"SuperSpeed USB\" (SS) that can transfer data at up to 5 Gbit/s (625 MB/s), which is about 10 times faster than the USB 2.0 standard. It is recommended that manufacturers distinguish USB 3.0 connectors from their USB 2.0 counterparts by using blue color for the Standard-A receptacles and plugs, and by the initials \"SS\".\n\nUSB 3.1, released in July 2013, is the successor standard that replaces the USB 3.0 standard. USB 3.1 preserves the existing \"SuperSpeed\" transfer rate, giving it the new label \"USB 3.1 Gen 1\", while defining a new \"SuperSpeed+\" transfer mode, called \"USB 3.1 Gen 2\" which can transfer data at up to 10 Gbit/s over the existing USB-type-A and USB-C connectors (1250 MB/s, twice the rate of USB 3.0).\n\nUSB 3.2, released in September 2017, replaces the USB 3.1 standard. It preserves existing USB 3.1 \"SuperSpeed\" and \"SuperSpeed+\" data modes and introduces two new \"SuperSpeed+\"transfer modes over the USB-C connector using two-lane operation, with data rates of 10 and 20 Gbit/s (1250 and 2500 MB/s).\n\nEach hub has exactly one upstream port and a number of downstream ports. The upstream port connects the hub (directly or through other hubs) to the host. Other hubs or devices can be attached to the downstream ports. During normal transmission, hubs are essentially transparent: data received from its upstream port is broadcast to all devices attached to its downstream ports (pictorially described in the USB 2.0 specification in Figure 11-2. Hub Signaling Connectivity); data received from a downstream port is generally forwarded to the upstream port only. This way, what is sent by the host is received by all hubs and devices, and what is sent by a device is received by the host but not by the other devices (an exception is resume signalling). Downstream routing has been changed in USB 3.0 with the addition of Point to Point routing: A route string sent in the packet header allows a USB 3.0 host to only send a downstream packet to a single destination port, decreasing congestion and power consumption.\n\nHubs are not transparent when dealing with changes in the status of downstream ports, such as insertion or removal of devices. In particular, if a downstream port of a hub changes status, this change is dealt with in an interaction between the host and this hub; the hubs between them act as transparent in this case.\n\nTo this aim, each hub has a single interrupt endpoint \"1 IN\" (endpoint address 1, hub-to-host direction) used to signal changes in the status of the downstream ports. When someone plugs in a device, the hub detects voltage on either D+ or D- and signals the insertion to the host via this interrupt endpoint. When the host polls this interrupt endpoint, it learns that the new device is present. It then instructs the hub (via the default control pipe) to reset the port where the new device was plugged in. This reset makes the new device assume address 0, and the host can then interact with it directly; this interaction will result in the host assigning a new (non-zero) address to the device.\n\nAny USB 2.0 hub that supports a higher standard than USB 1.1 (12 Mbit/s) will translate between the lower standard and the higher standard using what is called a transaction translator (TT). For example, if a USB 1.1 device is connected to a port on a USB 2.0 hub, then the TT would automatically recognize and translate the USB 1.1 signals to USB 2.0 on the uplink. However, the default design is that all lower-standard devices share the same transaction translator and thus create a bottleneck, a configuration known as the single transaction translator.\nConsequently, multi transaction translators (Multi-TT) were created, which provide more transaction translators such that bottlenecks are avoided. Note that USB 3.0 hubs do not currently perform transaction translation to super-speed for USB 2.0 devices.\n\nMost USB hubs use one or more integrated controllers (ICs), of which several designs are available from various manufacturers. Most support a four-port hub system, but hubs using 16-port hub controllers are also available in the industry. The USB bus allows seven cascading tiers of ports. The root hub is the first tier, and the last devices are on the seventh tier, which allows 5 tiers worth of hubs between them. The maximum number of user devices is reduced by the number of hubs. With 50 hubs attached, the maximum number is 127 − 50 = 77.\n\nAlso available are so-called \"sharing hubs\", which effectively are the reverse of a USB hub, allowing several PCs to access (usually) a single peripheral. They can either be manual, effectively a simple switch-box, or automatic, incorporating a mechanism that recognizes which PC wishes to use the peripheral and switches accordingly. They cannot grant both PCs access at once. Some models, however, have the ability to control multiple peripherals separately (e.g., two PCs and four peripherals, assigning access separately). Only the simpler switches tend to be automatic, and this feature generally places them at a higher price point too. Modern \"keyboard, video and mouse\" switches (KVM) can also often share USB devices between several computers.\n\n"}

The books were written by Stephen Cosgrove and illustrated by Robin James. The books are short stories with colorful illustrations that have a moral perspective.\n\nCosgrove wrote the books after searching for an easy to read book with a message to read to his then three-year-old daughter. After finding primarily large expensive books, Cosgrove teamed up with illustrator James to create low cost softcover books. After receiving an offer to publish the books only in hardcover, Cosgrove created his own publishing company - Serendipity Press. The first four books of the Serendipity Series were released in December of 1973. They are: \"Serendipity\", \"The Dream Tree\", \"Wheedle on the Needle\", and \"The Muffin Muncher\". Cosgrove merged Serendipity Press with the publishing company, Price/Stern/Sloan (now part of Penguin Random House) in 1978 so that Cosgrove could focus on writing. Cosgrove decided to re-edit his earlier books, which have been republished with the changes. To date, there are 70 books in the series, written from the kindergarten to grade three levels.\n\nThe animals in the Serendipity series include bears, cats, dogs, horses, squirrels, rabbits, and mythical creatures such as unicorns, dragons, sea monsters, and pegasus. Cosgrove also invented his own creatures such as the wheedle, hucklebug and kritter. The books present moral issues such as growing up, disabilities, abuse, fear, friendship, prejudice, gossip, and helping the environment.\n\nThe book series was adapted into a 26-episode anime series entitled \"Serendipity the Pink Dragon\" and 26-episode cartoon series \"Little Mouse on the Prairie\".\n\nAt least 25 of the books were translated into Spanish (based on the list in \"El Dragon Gloton\") and at least 6 in Italian (by Arnoldo Mondadori Editore).\n\n"}

They are supplied in paste, powder, gel or liquid form. Many dentifrices have been produced over the years, some focusing on marketing strategies to sell products, such as offering whitening capabilities. The most essential dentifrice recommended by dentists is toothpaste which is used in conjunction with a toothbrush to help remove food debris and dental plaque. Dentifrice is also the French word for toothpaste.\n\nToothpaste is a dentifrice used in conjunction with a toothbrush to help maintain oral hygiene. The essential components are an abrasive, binder, surfactant and humectant. Other ingredients are also used. The main purpose of the paste is to help remove debris and plaque with some marketed to serve accessory functions such as breath freshening and teeth whitening.\n\nTooth powder is an alternative to toothpaste. Modern versions may be sold with or without fluoride.\n\nTooth powder was historically used among the Romans to clean and whiten teeth, to fix them when loose, to strengthen the gums, and to assuage toothache. They made tooth powder from a variety of substances, such as the bones, hoofs, and horns of certain animals; crabs; oyster and murex shells; and egg-shells. These ingredients were reduced to a fine powder, sometimes after having been previously burnt. Some versions contained honey, ground myrrh, nitre, salt, and hartshorn, which would be added after the initial powdering process. Pliny the Elder reported the use of pounded pumice as a dentifrice. Arguably the best-known mention of tooth care among the Romans is found in a letter by Apuleius, who complains that using tooth powder is nothing to be ashamed of, especially compared to the \"utterly repulsive things they do in Spain.\" Apuleius quotes Catullus in saying that he would be using his own urine \"to brush his teeth and his red gums.\"\n\nBy 1924, diatomaceous earth was mined for tooth powder. In modern times, baking soda has been the most commonly used tooth powder, although this has now been mostly supplanted by commercial toothpastes.\n\nThe use of powdered substances such as charcoal, brick, and salt for cleaning teeth has been historically widespread in India, particularly in rural areas. Modern tooth powder has been positioned as a cost-effective substitute for toothpaste, as it can be applied with the index finger without requiring use of a toothbrush.\n\nMouthwashes come in a variety of compositions, many claiming to kill bacteria that make up plaque or to freshen breath. In their basic form, they are usually recommended for use after brushing but some manufacturers recommend pre-brush rinsing. Dental research has recommended that mouthwash should be used as an aid to brushing rather than a replacement, because the sticky resistant nature of plaque prevents it from being actively removed by chemicals alone, and physical detachment of the sticky proteins is required.\n\nTooth soap cleans gums as well as fissures and pits in teeth using soap. The soap helps remove oils, residue and other contaminants. It is available in hard, liquid and gel.\n\n"}

Her doctor calms her and tells her that he wants to share a story with her before she makes her decision. The doctor's name is Alberto Limonta and he begins recounting the story of the Del Junco family... Don Rafael Del Junco (Ignacio López Tarso) is the severe patriarch of a respected Veracruz family and demands absolute obedience from his two daughters María Elena and Matilde (real-life sisters Verónica and Beatriz Castro) and his wife Dona Constancia. María Elena manages to have an affair with a traveling salesman named Alfredo Martinez, played by Salvador Pineda. Martinez abandons her after knowing that she is pregnant with his child.\n\nDon Rafael, in all of his fury sends María Elena and her black nanny María Dolores (Socorro Avelar) into hiding to avoid any scandals to his family. The two women are kept prisoners by Bruno, the foreman (Julio César Inbert), who is instructed by Don Rafael to kill the baby as soon as it is born. María Dolores manages to arrange the disappearance of the baby boy and instead flees to Mexico City while the boy Albertico played by Verónica Castro's real-life son Cristian Castro. Albertico Limonta, who took the last name of Maria Dolores, knows nothing about the existence of María Elena.\n\nThe storyline has Alberto going back to Veracruz as he takes a job as a resident at the city hospital.

Its primary responsibilities are the protection of Iraq's coastline and offshore assets. Initially called the \"Iraqi Coastal Defense Force\", its official name was changed on 12 January 2005.\n\nAs of February 2011, the navy had approximately 5,000 sailors and marines which form an Operational headquarters, five afloat squadrons, and two marine battalions.\n\nHeaded by Rear Admiral Muhammad Jawad, the navy had plans to build six \"Al Uboor\"-class patrol boats in Baghdad, with the first of the boats to enter service in September 2005. This project however, was ultimately canceled. Additionally, two \"Assad\"-class corvettes built for Iraq in the 1980s by Italy were originally planned to be delivered sometime around 2006–2007. The ships however, were found to be in a worse state than originally believed, forcing the Iraqi navy to reconsider the deal and instead buy 4, newer, smaller modified-Diciotti class vessels. The 5 British corvettes and 1 Soviet patrol boat operated by the Saddam Hussein-era Iraqi Navy were destroyed in the 1991 Persian Gulf War and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, respectively.\n\nThe Iraqi Navy is designed for coastal water protection; preventing the smuggling of people, oil and weapons; and to protect the country's oil platforms. As a result, it mainly needs patrol boats. These may be backed up by fast attack craft. The patrol boats need to have the ability to launch rigid-inflatable boats (RIBs) for boarding ships and also possibly be able to accommodate a helicopter which would increase their patrol capability. The Iraqi Navy is building a second Marine battalion. In 2016 the Iraqi Navy awarded money to a ship maintenance company to sustain its current fleet of ships.\n\nThe Iraqi Navy was formed in 1937 as a small four-ship force headquartered in Basra. Between 1937 and 1958, it was primarily a riverine force.\n\nFollowing the 14 July Revolution of 1958, the Iraqi Navy began to expand. Operationally based in the port of Umm Qasr, the Arabic Gulf Academy for Sea Studies was established in Basra, which offered a bachelor's degree in war and engineering naval studies. By 1988, the Navy grew to a force of 5,000, but played a relatively small role during the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War. Much of the Navy was destroyed during Operation Pearl.\n\nBetween 1977 and 1987, the Iraqi Navy received eight s, armed with Styx anti-ship missiles, from the Soviet Union. It also purchased four s and six s from Italy, although these were never delivered because of international sanctions following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.\n\nThe Iraqi Navy was almost completely destroyed during the Gulf War of 1991. The force had 19 ships sunk and 6 vessels damaged. In total, more than 100 Iraqi ships were destroyed. The Navy was not rebuilt and played little part in the Iraq War (2003). One exception was two mine warfare vessels captured by US Navy and Coast Guard units during the assault on Al Faw; The tug \"Jumariya\", towing a well camouflaged minelaying barge, and the tug \"Al Raya\", which had been outfitted as a minelayer itself. Of the units that remained by late 2002, most were in a poor state of repair and the crews were in a poor state of readiness. Whatever units that remained after 1991 were used primarily for safeguarding Saddam's palaces on the Tigris river.\n\nIn January 2004, the Iraqi Coastal Defense Force (ICDF) officially began training its first 214 volunteers.\n\nOn 30 September 2004, the ICFD assumed the responsibility of protecting the Iraqi coastline, with actual patrol operations beginning the following day, on 1 October 2004.\n\nOn 11 November 2008, Rear Admiral Muhammad Jawad signed the historic non-legally binding Khawr Abd Allah Protocols or \"KAA Protocols\" at the Kuwait Naval Base. The protocols were the concept of the British Royal Navy in 2008 when in command of Combined Task Force 158 operating in the northern Gulf region and specifically within Iraqi territorial waters for the protection of the Iraqi oil terminals Al Basrah Oil Terminal and in support of Iraqi maritime boundaries. They are a non-legally binding military agreement aiding deconfliction between the maritime forces of Kuwait and Iraq in the Khawr Abd Allah waterway and are reflected in a former United Kingdom Hydrographic Office chart and which was re-titled the \"KAA Interoperability Admiralty Chart\".\n\nThe protocols were developed, written and mediated by a British Royal Marine barrister; Lieutenant Colonel David Hammond, RM; working alongside the heads and staffs of both the Kuwaiti Navy and Iraqi Navy and which saw the historic first meeting on board a British warship on 8 May 2008. The protocols were historically ratified and signed on 11 November 2008 at Kuwait Naval Base in the presence of Vice-Admiral William Gortney, USN; commander of the United States Naval Forces Central Command based in Bahrain and remain an enduring success story in the region highlighting co-operation and co-ordination between the two countries.\n\nOn 30 April 2010, Iraqi naval forces took over responsibility for the protection of the Khawr al-Amaya and Basra oil terminals, as well as the ports of Umm Qasr and al-Zubair.\n\nIraqi Naval Headquarters: Baghdad (Camp Victory).\n\nMay move to Umm Qasr.\n\nOperational Headquarters: Umm Qasr\n\nNaval Training Center: Umm Qasr\n\nMaritime Academy: Basrah\n\nDiving Squadron: Umm Qasr\n\nRHIBs\n\nPatrol Squadron: Umm Qasr\n\nPS701, PS702, PS703, PS704, PB301, PB302, PB303, and 5× U/I PBs.\n\nPatrol Squadron: planned\n\nPatrol Squadron: planned\n\nPatrol Squadron: planned\n\nSmall Boat Squadron: Umm Qasr\n\nSquadron equipped with American Defender Class boats.\n\nSupport & Auxiliary Squadron: Umm Qasr\n\n1st Marine Brigade Special Troops Battalion: Basrah Log City\n\nIn December 2010 was redesignated 1st and moving to Basrah Log City.

Four of the six ships were eventually purchased by the Royal Malaysian Navy in October 1995 as the Laksamana-class corvette, while the remaining two were mothballed at La Spezia.\nOn 19 May 2017, it was reported that the remaining two vessels would be delivered to the Iraq Navy after 26 years. They eventually left La Spezia on a semi-submersible carrier \"Eide Trader\" on 22 May and reached Iraq in June 2017.\n\nOn 15 February 2006 the Iraqi Navy signed a $101 million contract with the Italian Government to provide four Saettia MK4 class Offshore-Patrol Vessels.\n\nThis is a modified Diciotti class offshore patrol boat, as originally used by the Guardia Costiera. The vessels are to be built by Fincantieri at Riva Trigoso, with modifications including increased crew capacity of 38. The contract also comprises the provision of logistical support and crew training with each crew completing a 7-week training course. In cooperation with the Marina Militare (Italian Navy), each commissioning crew is provided with a week’s bridge simulator course at the Academy in Livorno.\n\nIn May 2009, the first vessel, Patrol Ship 701 named \"Fatah\" (Arabic for Opening), was handed over at the Muggiano, La Spezia shipyard. The crew had been training since January 2009, and would now be heading for Umm Qasr, a 20-day/5,000 nautical miles journey via the Mediterranean, Suez Canal and Red Sea. There, additional training will be completed, before the vessel takes over duties from the British Royal Marine patrols, who will then revert to a training role of new crew. The vessels will be used to patrol the exclusive economic zone, control maritime traffic, for search and rescue and fire fighting.\n\nIn September 2009, the Iraqi Navy awarded a $181 million contract to Swiftships Shipbuilders of Morgan City, Louisiana for the construction of nine Model 35PB1208 E-1455 coastal patrol vessels. The vessels are purchased under Foreign Military Sales.\nThe Iraqi Navy is expected by the end of the year to award a $109 million contract to build two 60-meter Off-Shore Support Vessels. The FMS program will contribute $82 million. The ships will provide logistical support for securing the oil platforms, to the Interceptor boats and more than 60 Fast Attack boats.\n\nThe five 27-meter Predator (NHS615) Class patrol boats: (P-101), (P-102), (P-103), (P-104), (P-105); were built by Wuhan Nanhua High-speed Ship Engineering Co., Ltd. and delivered in 2002, they were to be the new ICDF's first ships and were to be purchased under the oil-for-food program. Due to their military compatibilities they were not allowed to enter Iraq until 2003. The vessel has one(1) continuous freeboard main deck with camber and slight fore sheer, one deck house and wheelhouse. The hull below main deck is divided by transversal bulkheads into 4 spaces. The speed of the vessel under sea trial conditions is 32 knots. Crew: 14.\n\nSeptember 2006, an Iraqi marine company will deliver a new ship (Al Shams or the Sun) which was bought from Iraqi aquatic transportation company to be employed as guiding afloat station across the sea in order. In March 2010, the Iraqi Navy awarded a USD70 million contract through FMS to RiverHawk Fast Sea Frames, LLC, Tampa, Florida for two 60-metre offshore support vessels. The two vessels were delivered on 20 December 2012.\n\nThe Iraqi Navy will reportedly be purchasing ScanEagle UAVs in the near future for maritime reconnaissance support. Exact numbers and delivery dates are still unknown as of January 2012.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2316378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316378", "title": "Ford R series", "text": "Ford R series\n\nThe Ford R series was a range of single-decker bus and single-decker coach chassis, built by Ford UK that evolved from designs made by Thames Trader until the mid-1960s. A number of components were shared with the D-series lorry, including the engine which was mounted vertically at the front of the vehicle, ahead of the front axle so as to provide a passenger entrance opposite the driver. The original R192 and longer R226 models later became the R1014 and R1114 variants (nominally 10 and 11 metres long respectively with 140 bhp engines) which with constant revision and upgrading had become R1015 and R1115 by the mid-1980s. In an attempt to lower the floor height of the vehicle, the turbocharged diesel engine was tilted over to one side around 1978. Synchromesh transmission was fitted as standard but some later examples were equipped with Allison automatic gearboxes to ease the driver's workload in urban areas.\n\nIn the United Kingdom the design was popular during the 1970s, when considerable financial assistance was available to operators for fleet renewal, but following the election of the Conservative Government in 1979, the subsidy money began to dry up causing demand for full-size buses and coaches to decline and the last R series was built around 1986. Front-engined buses have generally fallen out of favour in Europe, as new accessibility requirements favour rear- or side-engined designs so a low front entrance can be provided. Few examples of the Ford R series remain in current passenger use, but many have gone on to second lives as mobile homes and stock car transporters.\n\nAnother significant user of the type was Jersey Motor Transport, who, during the 1970s and 1980s, purchased little else. The operational fleet consisted 100% of this bus model for several years during this period, and was chosen because of the manufacturer's willingness to supply chassis of non-standard width and length to suit local size limits. Many of these vehicles received bodywork by Duple whose narrow-width Dominant also found buyers on other chassis in the UK, but earlier examples were constructed by Willowbrook and later versions by Wadham Stringer. JMT also had a number of longer and wider examples, which had started life in the late 1960s with Trimdon Motor Services in the north-east of England: these Plaxton-bodied buses required special dispensation to operate on the island, being restricted to certain services where the roads could accommodate them. All were sold for further use after a few years. A similar model was used by the Inner London Education Authority as school buses.\n\n"}
{"id": "2316386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316386", "title": "Hmong Americans", "text": "Hmong Americans\n\nHmong Americans are Americans of Hmong descent. Most Hmong Americans are those that emigrated to the United States as refugees in the late 1970s, and their descendants. Some refugees fled Laos due to their cooperation (or perceived cooperation) with the United States' Central Intelligence Agency operatives in northern Laos during the Vietnam War. Over half of the Laotian Hmong population left the country, or attempted to leave, in 1975, at the culmination of the war. About 90% of those who made it to refugee camps in Thailand were ultimately resettled in the United States. The rest, about 8 to 10%, resettled in countries including Canada, France, the Netherlands, and Australia. According to the 2010 US Census, the population count for Hmong Americans was 260,000. Hmong Americans face disparities in healthcare, and socioeconomic challenges that lead to lower health literacy and median life expectancy, and per capita income. \n\nInitially only 1,000 Hmong people were evacuated to the US. In May 1976, another 11,000 Hmong were allowed to enter the United States. By 1978 some 30,000 Hmong had immigrated to the US and by 1998, there were 200,000 Hmong living in the US. This first wave was made up primarily of men directly associated with General Vang Pao's Secret Army, which had been aligned with US war efforts during the Vietnam War. Vang Pao's Secret Army, which was subsidized by the US Central Intelligence Agency, fought mostly along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, where his forces sought to disrupt North Vietnamese weapons supply efforts to the communist VietCong rebel forces in South Vietnam. Ethnic Laotian and Hmong veterans, and their families, led by Colonel Wangyee Vang formed the Lao Veterans of America in the aftermath of the war to help refugees in the camps in Thailand and to help former veterans and their families in the United States, especially with family reunification and resettlement issues.\n\nThe passage of the Refugee Act of 1980 represented the second-wave of Hmong immigration. The clans, from which the Hmong take their surnames, are: Chang (Tsaab) or Cha (Tsab), Chao (Tsom), Cheng (Tsheej), Chue (Tswb), Fang (Faaj) or Fa (Fag), Hang (Haam) or Ha (Ham), Her (Hawj), Khang (Khaab) or Kha (Khab), Kong (Koo) or Soung (Xoom), Kue (Kwm), Lee (Lis), Lor (Lauj), Moua (Muas), Pha (Phab), Thao (Thoj), Vang (Vaaj) or Va (Vaj), Vue or Vu (Vwj), Xiong (Xyooj) and Yang (Yaaj) or Ya (Yaj).\n\nFollowing the 1980 immigration wave, a heated global political debate developed over how to deal with the remaining Hmong refugees in Thailand. Many had been held in squalid Thailand-based refugee camps, and the United Nations and the Clinton administration sought to repatriate them to Laos.\n\nReports of human rights violations against the Hmong in Laos, including killings and imprisonments, led most Thailand-based Hmong to oppose returning there, even as the conditions worsened of the camps in Thailand, because of their lack of sufficient funding.\n\nOne of the more prominent examples of apparent Laotian abuse of the Hmong was the fate of Vue Mai, a former soldier. The US Embassy in Bangkok recruited him to return to Laos under the repatriation program, in their effort to reassure the Thai-based Hmong that their safety in Laos would be assured. But, Vue disappeared in Vientiane. The US Commission for Refugees later reported that he was arrested by Lao security forces and never seen again.\n\nEspecially following the Vue Mai incident, the Clinton and UN policy of returning the Hmong to Laos began to meet with strong political opposition by US conservatives and some human rights advocates. Michael Johns, a former White House aide to President George H. W. Bush and a Heritage Foundation foreign policy analyst, along with other influential conservatives, led a campaign to grant the Thai-based Hmong immediate US immigration rights. In an October 1995 \"National Review\" article, citing the Hmong's contributions to US war efforts during the Vietnam War, Johns described President Clinton's support for returning the Thai-based Hmong refugees to Laos as a \"betrayal\" and urged Congressional Republicans to step up opposition to the repatriation. Opposition to the repatriation grew in Congress and among Hmong families in the US Congressional Republicans responded by introducing and passing legislation to appropriate sufficient funds to resettle all remaining Hmong in Thailand in the United States. Clinton vowed to veto the legislation.\n\nIn addition to internal US opposition to the repatriation, the government of Laos expressed reservations about the repatriation, stating that the Hmong remaining in Thailand were a threat to its one-party communist government and the Marxist government in Vientiane, Laos. In a significant and unforeseen political victory for the Hmong and their US Republican advocates, tens of thousands of Thai-based Hmong refugees were ultimately granted US immigration rights. The majority were resettled in California, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. The defeat of the repatriation initiative resulted in the reunifications in the US of many long-separated Hmong families. In 2006, as a reflection of the growth of the minority in the state, the Wisconsin State Elections Board translated state voting documents into the Hmong language.\n\nThroughout the Vietnam War, and for two decades following it, the US government stated that there was no \"Secret War\" in Laos and that the US was not engaged in air or ground combat operations in Laos. In the late 1990s, however, several US conservatives, led by Johns and others, alleged that the Clinton administration was using the denial of this covert war to justify a repatriation of Thailand-based Hmong war veterans to Laos. It persuaded the US government to acknowledge the Secret War (conducted mostly under President Richard Nixon) and to honor the Hmong and American veterans from the war.\n\nOn May 15, 1997, in a total reversal of US policy, the federal government acknowledged that it had supported a prolonged air and ground campaign in Laos against the North Vietnamese Army and Vietcong. That day it dedicated the Laos Memorial on the grounds of Arlington National Cemetery in honor of the Hmong and other combat veterans from the Secret War. In 1999 there were about 250,000 Hmong people living in the United States, living in numerous medium and large cities.\n\nSome Hmong remained in refugee camps Thailand at the time of the September 11, 2001, attacks. This resulted in the tightening of US immigration laws, especially under the Patriot Act and the Real ID Act, and the immigration of Hmong refugees to the US has significantly slowed. Most Hmong refugees in Thailand had been engaged in documented armed conflict (although under US sponsorship) during and after the Vietnam War. The anti-terrorism legislation created barriers to such people being accepted as immigrants.\n\nStates with the largest Hmong population include: California (86,989; 0.2%), Minnesota (63,619; 1.2%), Wisconsin (47,127; 0.8%), and North Carolina (10,433; 0.1%), Michigan (5,924; 0.1%), Colorado (4,530; 0.1%), Georgia (3,623; 0.03%), Alaska (3,534; 0.5%), Oklahoma (3,369; 0.1%), and Oregon (2,920; 0.1%). The metropolitan areas of Fresno and Minneapolis-St. Paul have especially large Hmong communities. St. Paul, Minnesota has the largest Hmong population per capita in the United States (10.0%; 28,591 Hmong Americans), followed by Wausau in Wisconsin (3,569; 9.1% of its population).\n\nToday, according to the 2010 US Census, 260,073 people of Hmong descent reside in the United States up from 186,310 in 2000. The vast majority of the growth since 2000 was from natural increase, except for the admission of a final group of over 15,000 refugees in 2004 and 2005 from Wat Tham Krabok in Thailand. Of the 260,073 Hmong-Americans, 247,595 or 95.2% are Hmong alone, and the remaining 12,478 are mixed Hmong with some other ethnicity or race. The Hmong-American population is among the youngest of all groups in the United States, with the majority being under 30 years old, born after 1980, with most part-Hmong are under 10 years old.\n\nIn terms of metropolitan area, the largest Hmong-American community is in Minneapolis-Saint Paul-Bloomington, MN Metro Area (74,422); followed by Fresno, CA Metro Area (31,771); Sacramento, CA Metro Area (26,996); Milwaukee, WI Metro Area (11,904); and Merced, CA Metro Area (7,254).\n\nThere are smaller Hmong communities scattered across the country, including cities in California; Colorado (Denver, Colorado – 4,264); Michigan (Detroit, Michigan and Warren, Michigan – 4,190), Alaska (Anchorage, Alaska – 3,494); North Carolina (Hickory, North Carolina); Georgia (Auburn, Duluth, Lawrenceville, Monroe, Atlanta, and Winder); Wisconsin (Eau Claire, Appleton, Green Bay, La Crosse, and Stevens Point, Plover, and Sheboygan); Kansas (Kansas City – 1,754); Oklahoma (Tulsa – 2,483); Southwest Missouri; Northwest Arkansas (Benton County); Washington; Oregon (Portland), and throughout the United States.\n\nAs of the 2000 US Census, the largest Hmong population by metropolitan area resided in and around Minneapolis-St. Paul, with 40,707 people. The following areas were Greater Fresno with 22,456 people, Greater Sacramento (Sacramento-Yolo) with 16,261, Greater Milwaukee (Milwaukee-Racine) with 8,078, Greater Merced with 6,148, Greater Stockton (Stockton-Lodi) with 5,553, Appleton-Oshkosh-Neenah with 4,741, Greater Wausau with 4,453, Hickory-Morganton-Lenoir (North Carolina) with 4,207, and Greater Detroit (Detroit-Ann Arbor-Flint) with 3,926.\n\nCalifornia has the largest Hmong population in the United States by state. As of 2010, there are 95,120 Hmong Americans in California.\n\nIn 2002, the State of California counted about 35,000 students of Hmong descent in schools. According to Jay Schenirer, a member of the school board of the Sacramento City Unified School District, most of the students resided in the Central Valley, in an area ranging from Fresno to Marysville. Fresno County and Sacramento County combined have almost 12,000 Hmong students.\n\nAs of 2002, of the Hmong students who took the California English Language Development Test, which measures English fluency in students who are learning English, 15% of Hmong scores at the \"advanced\" or \"early advanced\" classifications, while 30% of Vietnamese English learning students and 21% of all of California's over 1.5 million English learning students scored at those levels. Suanna Gilman-Ponce, the multilingual education department head of Sacramento City Unified, said that the Hmong students have lower rates due to having parents who speak little English; therefore they enter American schools with few English skills. In addition, their culture was not literate, so Hmong history was not written down and history books did not discuss Hmong history.\n\nIn 2011, Susan B. Anthony Elementary School in Sacramento established a Hmong-language immersion program. It is the only Hmong immersion program in a California public school, and is one of two Hmong immersion school programs in the United States. In the Fresno Unified School District, over 10,000 signatures of support were collected for the naming of a new elementary school for General Vang Pao, a well known leader from the Secret Wars in Laos and the Hmong American diaspora.\n\nColorado is home to approximately 5,000 Hmong who first settled in the state in the late 1976 to early 1980s. Today, most of the Hmong live in the north metro Denver area including Arvada, Brighton, Broomfield, Federal Heights, Lafayatte, Northglenn, Thornton and Westminster.\n\nIn 1995, Golden, Colorado became the first city in the United States to designate a Lao-Hmong Recognition Day. Since then, other areas in the country followed suit, declaring July 22 “Lao-Hmong Recognition Day”. The establishment of this day recognizes the bravery, sacrifice, and loyalty to the United States exhibited by the Lao-Hmong. The Lao-Hmong Recognition Day was held in recognition and to honor of the Lao-Hmong Special Guerrilla Units (SGU) Veterans, \"America’s Secret Army and Most Loyal Allies.\" The SGUs were composed of indigenous Laotians, especially the Hmong, Lao, Mien, Lue, Khmu and Thaidam tribes, and were known for their patriotism, valiant service, personal sacrifice and loyal support of the United States Armed Forces in Laos during the Vietnam War.\n\n\"Historically, the Lao-Hmong people were one of our country’s most loyal allies. During the Vietnam War, they fought bravely alongside U.S. soldiers. Many emigrated to the U.S. and now proudly call this country their home. We are grateful for their service and sacrifice to our nation,\" said U.S. Rep. Ed Perlmutter (CO-07).\n\nThe Hmong Alliance and Missionary District headquarters is located in Thornton, CO. In 2018, the Hmong District celebrates its fortieth-year anniversary in St. Paul, MN with over 110 churches scattered throughout the United States with an inclusive membership of 30,000 plus people. The Hmong District is led by Rev. Dr. Lantzia Thao (Tswv Txos), who acts as the Hmong District Superintendent overseeing the entire movement and operations.\n\nKansas has a moderate Hmong population. Kansas City was one of the first cities to accept Hmong people after the war. Its Hmong population declined in the early 80s due to migration from Kansas to California, and the Northern Midwest. The population has since stabilized and has more than double every decade since 1990. According to the 2010 Census, 1,732 Hmong people lived in Kansas of which 1,600 lived in the Kansas Side of Kansas City and an estimated more than 400 families and 2,000 Hmong living in the Greater Kansas City Area in 2013. Lao Family was established in Kansas City in the 1980s but the Hmong separated from the organization to create the Hmong American Community, Inc. which today is still a functioning entity hosting Hmong New Year celebrations in Kansas City. Kansas City has a vast majority Green Hmong population and is greater than 80% converted to Christianity though more and more Hmong people move in every year that still practices the traditional religion. Kansas City is home to Hmong churches, multiple Hmong runs and owned manufacturing companies, nail salons, small business such as insurance and barber shops, vendors at the flea market, an organization such as Hmong Village Inc., Vang Organization, and Herr Organization just to name a few. \n\nAs of 2011, according to Judy Thao, the director of the United Hmong of Massachusetts, an organization based in Lowell, about 2,000 Hmong resided in the State of Massachusetts. Thao said that the largest community, with 60 to 70 families, is located in the Fitchburg/Leominster area. As of 2010, there are 412 people of Hmong descent living in Fitchburg (one percent of the city's population). Thao said that about 20 to 30 families each live in the second largest communities, in Springfield and Brockton.\n\nAs of 1999, fewer than 4,000 Hmong people lived in Detroit. As of 2005, Michigan had 5,400 Hmong people; reflecting an increase from 2,300 in the 1990s. As of 2005, most Hmong in Michigan lived in Metro Detroit in the cities of Detroit, Pontiac, and Warren. As of 2002 the concentrations of Hmong and Laotian people in the Wayne–Macomb–Oakland tri-county area were in northeast Detroit, southern Warren, and central Pontiac. That year, Kurt Metzger and Jason Booza, authors of \"Asians in the United States, Michigan and Metropolitan Detroit,\" wrote that \"The 3,943 Hmong living in tri-county area is one of the most concentrated of the Asian groups.\" As of 2007, almost 8,000 Hmong lived in Michigan, most in northeastern Detroit. As of 2007, Hmong were increasingly moving to Pontiac and Warren.\n\nThe Greater Lansing Area is home to the second largest Hmong American population in Michigan. After 1970, Hmong Americans began to settle in Lansing, Michigan's capital city. Hmong Americans in the Greater Lansing Area, often, have strong ties to churches. Churches like St. Michael's, Our Savior Lutheran Church, and All Saints Episcopal Church sponsored Hmong Americans coming to Lansing, providing them resources to make the transition to America a smoother experience. Lansing hosts a statewide Hmong New Year Festival.\n\nAs of 1999, Minnesota has the second largest US Hmong population by state. As of 2001, the largest Hmong population in the United States by the city is located in St. Paul.\n\n\"Pom Siab Hmoob\" (Gazing into the Heart of the Hmong) Theatre, which is reportedly the world's first Hmong theater group, was formed in 1990. It is based in the Twin Cities. It is now known as the Center for Hmong Arts and Talent (CHAT).\n\nThe film \"Gran Torino\" by Clint Eastwood, though set and filmed in Detroit, Michigan, stars five Minnesotan Hmong (Hmongesotan) Americans, and the original story was based on a neighborhood in St. Paul. It was the first mainstream US film to feature Hmong Americans.\n\nIn 2010, North Carolina had a population of 10,864 Hmong and has one of the highest rates of employment compared to other states in the US. 50% of the Hmong population work in the manufacturing industry. \n\nA group of Hmong refugees settled in Philadelphia after the end of the 1970s Laotian Civil War. They were attacked in discriminatory acts, and the city's Commission on Human Relations held hearings on the incidents. Anne Fadiman, author of \"The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down\", said that lower-class residents resented the Hmong receiving a $100,000 federal grant for employment assistance when they were also out of work; they believed that American citizens should be getting assistance. Between 1982 and 1984, three quarters of the Hmong people who had settled in Philadelphia left for other cities in the United States to join relatives who were already there.\n\nIn 1976, Hmong members of the U.S. Secret Army Special Guerrilla Unit, recruited by the CIA during the Vietnam War, were resettled in Rhode Island as refugees. In 1983 their population was estimated at 1,700–2,000. 2010 census results put the number of Rhode Island Hmong at 1,015. The Hmong United Association of Rhode Island puts on a Hmong New Year's festival annually. About sixty families are members of the Providence Hmong Church of the Christian and Missionary Alliance; they are known locally for their egg roll fundraiser, held in the spring.\n\nAs of 2010, Wisconsin has over 49,000 Hmong people—the largest Asian ethnic group in the state.\n\nIn December 1999, according to the Hmong National Development Inc., Chicago had about 500 Hmong people. There is a sizable Hmong population in Westminster, Colorado (0.8% of the city's population as of 2010).\n\nThe 2000 US Census reveals that 60% of all Hmong above 24 years of age have a highest educational attainment of high school or equivalent, as many of these immigrants came to America as adults or young adults. About 7% of Hmong have a bachelor's degree or higher. According to a government data collected in 2013, 40% of Hmong Americans drop out of school. Among the Hmong population, 38% have not received a high school degree, and 14% have at least a bachelor's degree. Educational attainment among Hmong women is significantly lower than among Hmong men, with about one in five Hmong women having a high school diploma.\n\nThe lack of formal education among Hmong immigrants is due to the fact that many were once farmers in the hills of Laos or were refugees from war who fled into remote jungles, and had little or no access to schools.\n\nIn St. Paul about 2,000 Hmong people have their bachelor's degree, 150 have their master's degree, and 68 have received their doctoral degree, which is a very low percentage considering the population of Hmong Americans in St. Paul is less than 36,000.\n\nIn the topic of community issues and Hmong in education, factors to consider are family dynamic, parent engagement, accessibility to resources, and the various school climates. The lack of emotional support for Hmong LGBTQ+ youth in Minnesota and Wisconsin reveal mental and health concerns which affect their academic performance.\n\nHmong girls and boys had also encountered difficulties in achieving success in the field of education as they adapted the Hmong culture, which is considered as rural, to contemporary American society (Ngo & Lor, 2013). Cha suggested that the dropout rate of Hmong teenagers was the highest among those of Asian American groups (2013). In the first few years after immigration, Hmong girls almost had no chance to be educated in school. Later, as they got the opportunities to go to school, around 90% of Hmong girls chose to quit school because parents preferred obedient and compliant daughters-in-law when looking for partners for their sons (Ngo & Lor, 2013).\n\nOn the other hand, Hmong young men are burdened more due to the high expectations on sons in Hmong culture, which led to their challenges in school, such as bad relationships with teachers and lack of participation in class. The word used to describe the work those Hmong boys were involved in for family was “helping out” (Ngo & Lor, 2013, p. 155), referring to an accepted and natural habit including working outside, taking care of the siblings, completing daily household, being cultural brokers for parents and attending numerous traditional ceremonies. For example, Hmong boys were asked to write checks to pay for utility bills and to prepare food for their younger brothers. Also, they went to ceremonies not only to maintain the family relationship but also to keep the traditions from disappearing.\n\nAccording to Yang (2013), after three decades of struggle, Hmong Americans had achieved in economic, political and educational aspects. Starting from small business, the businesses of Hmong had become international, diverse and high-tech since 2000. For example, about 50 home health care agencies which were supported by federal or state medical assistance were run by Hmong in Minnesota. The Hmong were also more involved in political activities that 57 percent of the Hmong in Minnesota regarded themselves as Democrats, shown by a survey in 2008, and several Hmong people, including Madison P. Nguyen, former Hmong refugee women in Minnesota, had been elected political staffs in city offices.\n\nThe last data collected by the American government puts the percentage of Hmong Americans living below the poverty line at 37.8%, an increase from recent years. This figure is over twice that of all Americans living below the poverty line, which is 16%.\n\nIn a 2013, NPR discussion with a member of the Economic Policy Institute and co-author of the book The Myth of the Model Minority Rosalind Chou who is also a professor of sociology. One of them stated that \"When you break it down by specific ethnic groups, the Hmong, the Bangladeshi, they have poverty rates that rival the African-American poverty rate.\"\n\nAs of 2014, factfinder census reveals that when American per capita income is divided by ethnic groups, Hmong Americans are the third lowest earning group, with an average per capita income of only $12,923, a figure that rests far below the American average of $25,825.\n\nHmong Americans have an average median household income of $48,000 which is lower than the American average of $53,600.\n\nThere are many cultural, political, and social issues that are being debated among Hmong American communities. Topics include political participation, poverty, gang violence, race relations, and education. The Hmong community also retains many ties with the Hmong still in Indochina and remains active in regional politics.\n\nPolitics and culture vary with the location of Hmong-American communities. The Twin Cities, St. Paul and Minneapolis, are more progressive as the queer/LGBTQ+ culture and politics surrounding sexuality and gender are projected and recognized at the local, regional, state, and national level.\n\nIdentities go beyond the Hmong-American identity. Heterosexuality and heteronormativity is traditionally tied to the Hmong identity and its history. Studies show that homophobia in the Hmong communities prior to the immigration to the United States is near to nothing, Hmong traditional elders didn't recall homophobia because non-heterosexual identities were nearly non-existent. Among the diverse identities of Hmong Americans, non-traditional gender and sexual identities have gained cultural, political, and social significance.\n\nIn 2003, Shades of Yellow (SOY), an LGBTQ+ non-profit organization, was established in St. Paul, Minnesota, to support Hmong people who identify as LGBTQ+. In March 2017, SOY announced the closing of their doors as leadership and funding levels changed.\n\nIn December 2005, the Sacramento Hmong LGBTQIA group was founded and serves to provide socials such as movie nights, potlucks, and cultural shows. The Sacramento Hmong LGBTQIA group collaborates with local organizations, for example, the Asian Pacific Islander Queer Sacramento Coalition (APIQSC), to build allyship and stronger political and social relationships within the LGBTQ+ Hmong and general API communities.\n\nSexual health is critical to the LGBTQ+ Hmong community as it is for the general Southeast Asian (SEA) community throughout the country. Social media and Southeast Asian presence in it calls for a high risk of contracting STI's and HIV, as well other transmissible diseases and health concerns. Sexual education and awareness, as well as education regarding online sex culture, is heavily recommended for awareness and safety when considering sexual health.\n\nCompared to other Southeast Asian refugees in America, Hmong refugees have the highest rates of mental health disorders, with an overall mental illness incidence rate at around 33.5%. This mental health problem has been attributed to traumatic past experiences and problems adjusting to life in the United States.\n\nGender roles play an integral factor for the mental health of Hmong women. Gender construct of Hmong women, traditionally, socially and politically, have historically been oppressive and marginalizing. Even in traditional Hmong cloth (\"paj ntaub)\" and folklore (\"dab neej)\" Hmong gender roles are concretely sewn and told, and repeated. Misogyny and patriarchy in the Hmong community is present to this day which calls for Hmong women empowerment initiatives throughout the United States.\n\nIn religious and traditional Hmong families the subject of mental health is taboo because of Shamanism, with the belief that remedy to health is through communication and exchanges with spirits. Through spiritual ceremonies, overall health is remedied, not through health facilities or specialists, not through science. In addition, LGBTQ+ Hmong individuals struggle with mental health due to the lack of education and attention on mental health in Hmong communities, deals with depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and suicide.\n\nIn other aspects of health, like cancer, Hmong Americans have the highest cancer mortality rates compared to other Asian American groups. Low cancer screenings and lack of interventions to address stigma of utilizing public health services are among some reasons for this trend. Access to education can help with increasing health practices like receiving a Pap test for cervical cancer screening. A Patient Navigation Program implemented in San Francisco for Hmong Americans led to a 38% increase in Pap test participation, highlighting progress made in increasing participation via education. A cross-sectional study of 168 immigrant Hmong Americans found that half of them reported not understanding health information. Factors like acculturation and number of years in the US were positively correlated with health literacy rate, and lower health literacy rates were associated with poor health in the participants. Acculturation indicators such as language use and social connections, were positively correlated with higher BMI-for-age in Hmong American children 9-18 years old. \n\nA study of 417 Hmong American parents and caregivers showed that the top two contributing factors to perceived barriers to immunization were socioeconomic position and use of traditional Hmong healthcare. Traditional Hmong healthcare includes the use of a traditional Hmong healer shaman, who is used as a complement to Western medicine by Hmong patients. Health disparities faced by Hmong Americans are overlooked with combined data that do not disaggregate ethnic groups within the label, Asian American. \n\nHmong Americans have experienced violence after immigrating to the United States. Some specific instances of violence against Hmong Americans have been murders, which a few have occurred while they were engaging in the activity of hunting. Hmong Americans have hunted because it is a common traditional practice in countries such as Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand. These are common countries from which the Hmong ethnic group has immigrated, although they do not have a specific home country. Chong Moua Yang, a Hmong American hunter, was murdered in Bath Township, Michigan on November 16, 2018. His murder, however, still remains unsolved.\n\nIn a 2018 study of 231 college students' experience and knowledge surrounding domestic violence, Takahashi and Lee found that two thirds were aware of domestic violence in their community, and 32.8% of Hmong women experienced violence. These domestic issues would be solved within clan systems and divorce is oftentimes not welcomed in order to maintain the relationship.\n\nThe Hmong language is spoken by approximately 4 million with about 5% residing in the United States. There are two different dialects, Hmong Ntsuab and Hmong Dawb. In America, these are known as Green Hmong and White Hmong. Many of the vowel sounds are quite a bit different in these dialects compared to some of the Asian ones. In the United States, about 60% speak White Hmong and 40% speak Green Hmong. The Centers for Disease Control states \"Though some Hmong report difficulty understanding speakers of a dialect not their own, for the most part, White and Green Hmong speakers seem to understand one another.\" As of 2012, Hmong in California are developing a Hmong-English online translator, in collaboration with Microsoft. \n\nTo maintain Hmong culture, history, and language, many organizations were created to conserve Hmong culture including the Lao Veterans of America, Lao Veterans of America Institute, Lao Human Rights Council, Hmong Advancement, Inc., Hmong Advance, Inc., United League for Democracy in Laos, Inc., Lao Family, Hmong National Development (HND) association and the \"Hmong Today\" and \"Hmong Times\" newspapers. In the case of kinship among other relatives in the United States, the Hmong people tend to stay in groups where there are much other Hmong residing. This allows them to share their cultural values and practices together.\n\nWhite Hmong (Hmoob Dawb) and Green Hmong (Moob Leeg) are the two primary dialects spoken by Hmong Americans. The difference between the two dialects is analogous to the difference between American and British English; thus, both can understand each other easily. Green Hmong is named so because of the color used in Green Hmong women's traditional costume.\n\nIt is seen that the majority of the Hmong American population is either White or Green Hmong, but with language, there can be some language barriers. For example, providing quality interpreter services can be difficult. Complicating communication issues is the fact that until the late 1960s no written form of the Hmong language existed, and many of the Hmong people were unable to read or write their own language. This makes the use of written materials for Hmong patients fairly useless. This kind of complication in communicating was able to be seen in Anne Fadiman's book, \"The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down: A Hmong Child, Her American Doctors, and the Collision of Two Cultures\", where the Lees cannot read or write their own language and have trouble when their daughter Lia has to go to the hospital. Lack of literacy creates a barrier in being able to properly give Lia her medications.\n\nFrom funerals to soul calling, Hmong rituals and ceremonies have been an important part of the Hmong cultural and spiritual experience. Since arriving in the United States in the late 1970s, many Hmong families still practice their rituals, but the number of traditional funerals preferred had dwindled due to a large number of Hmong, mostly the younger generations, converting to Christianity, lacking finances, and other reasons. Living in the United States also with jobs and school, there is not that much time to take a week off, which is how long most of these funeral rituals take.\n\nThere are several differences between traditional funeral rituals in Laos, Thailand and in the United States. Usually in Laos and Thailand funerals occur immediately in the home after a person dies. The person is dressed and then held within the hours at the home (Lee, 2009). Funerals can last three to four days and require washing and dressing the deceased, and conducting animal sacrifices to properly prepare the soul to be reincarnated.\n\nChoua Lee, a candidate for the St. Paul School Board, said she went to Saturday's Local DFL Party convention to campaign a little, raise awareness about the city's Hmong community and probably try again next time. \n\n\"I never expected to be endorsed,\" she say. \n\nThe simple act of social responsibility and civic engagement as mention above by Choua Lee become the beginning and the turning point for Hmong American to participate in American Politics and set the evolution of Hmong American Politics until today.\n\nOn June 4, 2007, following a lengthy federal investigation labeled \"Operation Flawed Eagle,\" warrants were issued by a California-based US federal court for the arrest of General Vang Pao, eight other Hmong people, and one non-Hmong person for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government of Laos in violation of the federal Neutrality Acts and various US weapons laws.\n\nThe federal charges allege that members of the group inspected weapons, including AK-47s, smoke grenades, and Stinger missiles, with the intent of purchasing them and smuggling them into Thailand in June 2007 for use in Hmong guerrilla war efforts against the Laotian government. The one non-Hmong person of the nine arrested, Harrison Jack, a 1968 West Point graduate, and retired Army infantry office. The defendants faced possible life prison terms for violation. Vang Pao and other defendants were ultimately granted bail, following the posting of $1.5 million in the property. Following the arrests, many Vang Pao supporters had called on President George W. Bush and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to pardon the defendants. On September 18, 2009, the federal government dropped all charges against Vang Pao, announcing in a release that the federal government was permitted to consider \"the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted.” On January 10, 2011, charges against all of the remaining defendants were dropped as well.\n\nThe 2008 film \"Gran Torino\", directed by Clint Eastwood, was the first mainstream US film to feature Hmong Americans. Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, an elderly, racist Korean War veteran living in Detroit, Michigan who befriends a Hmong teenager named Thao, played by Bee Vang, who previously tries to steal his Gran Torino as an initiation into a local Hmong gang run by his own cousins.\n\nIn the episode Body & Soul of the TV series House, the team treats a Hmong child that is believed to be possessed by a dab, which the doctors, as well the child's mother attempt to disprove. Following an exorcism in order to free the dab from the child, his symptoms go away, which his mother and grandfather attribute to the exorcism, while the doctors believe it was the long shot treatment of Ibuprofen to treat his Patent ductus arteriosus that cured him.\n\nAt least two Hmong have been elected to high public office. In 2002, Mee Moua became the first Hmong American legislator when she was elected to fill the Minnesota State Senate seat vacated by Randy Kelly when he was elected mayor of St. Paul. She later became the Senate majority whip. Cy Thao is a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives.\n\nAt age 14, Joe Bee Xiong fought alongside American soldiers like his father had done. When their village fell to the Communists, Xiong and his family fled to a refugee camp in Thailand and eventually ended up in Wisconsin in 1980. In 1996, Xiong was elected to the Eau Claire, Wisconsin city council. Xiong was the first Hmong to be elected to a city council in Wisconsin. He ran for the state Assembly in 2004. Xiong was traveling with family in his native country, Laos, when he died, possibly of heart-related complications. Wisconsin Congressman Ron Kind worked with Xiong to investigate reports of human rights abuses against Hmong still in Laos and Southeast Asia and says Xiong was a great community leader and an inspiration to many. Another Hmong, Thomas T. Vue, presently serves on the Eau Claire city council. Furthermore, Chue Neng Xiong was elected to the Eau Claire, WI school board and sworn into service on April 22, 2013.\n\nCommunity leaders and organizations, including Dr. Wangyee Vang, Dr. Cherzong Vang, the Lao Veterans of America, the Lao Veterans of America Institute, the Center for Public Policy Analysis, the Lao Human Rights Council, and others, have sought to educate the public and policymakers about the important contribution of the Hmong people, and Lao Hmong veterans, during the Vietnam War in support of US national security interests. In 1997, the Lao Veterans of America dedicated a monument in Arlington National Cemetery, the Laos Memorial, to help honor the Hmong veterans and community for their service to the United States during the Vietnam War and its aftermath. Each year, in May, they continue to host annual ceremonies with members of the US Congress and other officials, to honor the service of the Hmong. Many Hmong elders and young people attend the ceremonies and events in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2316398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316398", "title": "3 (American band)", "text": "3 (American band)\n\n3, also known as Three, is an American progressive rock band formed in Woodstock, New York in the early 1990s.\n\nThe band was founded in 1994 as a three piece: Joey Eppard on guitar and lead vocals, Josh Eppard on drums and Chris Bittner on bass. They came to the attention of Universal Records after well-received performances at the Woodstock festival in 1994, eventually getting signed in 1998, but following an unstable relationship with the label through its series of corporate mergers, the band was left with little prospect of releasing their album. Eventually, the band decided to release it on Planet Noise Records, a small indie label, and thenceforth managed themselves independently, until their 2005 signing with Metal Blade, on whose label they re-released \"Wake Pig\" in late 2005. Their career has been marked by several line-up changes, most notably Josh Eppard's departure to join Coheed and Cambria; the two bands used to be regular touring partners. The band has toured nationally several times, and have appeared on radio stations throughout the United States. Joey Eppard also has an active solo career and released a solo album, \"Been to the Future\", in 2002.\n\nWhen questioned about the band's name in an interview with Rock Something, Joey Eppard stated that they considered changing the name of the band several times, but always decided to keep the name 3. According to the same interview, the name of the band originally stems from Joey Eppard's own \"fascination\" with the number: \"It is a reference to the construct of our reality as having predominantly 3 aspects. For example, we live in a 3 dimensional universe on the third planet from the sun, experiencing time as past, present and future in a form that consists of mind, body and spirit.\" \n\nIn separate tours in May and October 2007 the band toured with the British progressive rock group Porcupine Tree, on their \"Fear of a Blank Planet\" North American tour. 3 also went on the road with 1980s rock band Scorpions, and later finished up the second leg of the \"Fear of a Blank Planet\" tour with Porcupine Tree.\n\nThe music video for the song \"All That Remains\" was voted the No. 16 Video of 2007 on MTV2's Headbanger's Ball. It was directed, shot and animated by David Brodsky.\n\nThey were a part of the \"Progressive Nation '08\" tour with Dream Theater, Opeth, and Between the Buried and Me.\n\nTheir fifth studio album, \"Revisions\", a compilation of re-recordings of never before released songs as well as selections from their first 2 studio albums, was released on October 27, 2009. At the time it was planned to be their final release on Metal Blade Records. They have already started to play a couple of their new songs (\"One with the Sun\" and \"You are the Alien\") at their live shows dating back to tours from late 2008. The band was due to record and release their next studio album for Roadrunner Records, but were subsequently dropped before any production began.\n\nThey have since re-signed with Metal Blade Records and released their sixth studio album \"The Ghost You Gave to Me\" on October 11, 2011.\n\nThe band themselves describe their music as \"dark yet uplifting, spiritual without any connection to religion\". Their music is punctuated by dark, sometimes incomprehensible lyrics, often rather detached from the accompanying music. Joey Eppard is considered a highly competent guitarist with a unique, primarily self-taught flamenco/slap hybrid guitar technique.\n\nOver the course of 3's discography, the band has covered a wide variety of music genres. This spectrum of style includes the following songs as examples of each genre: hip hop (Don't Even), R&B (You Call Me Baby), rockabilly (Paint by Number), blues (Bedroom in Hell), reggae (Brother), funk (Get 2Gether), psychedelic (Signs of Life), metal (These Iron Bones), pop rock (Live Entertainment), acoustic rock (Careless Kim), punk (Sawed Off Shotgun), progressive (Monster), flamenco (Bramfatura), experimental progressive (Dregs), rock 'n roll (One Way Town), soft rock (Lay Down the Law), pop (Soul Reality), folk (The Game), experimental (Broadway Alien), progressive funk (Leaving on the Light), and progressive metal (Only Child). The genre-defying diversity of their music is what gives them the self-proclaimed title of a hybrid band, though the band is currently in a state consisting primarily of progressive metal on their newest album The Ghost You Gave To Me. However, though the album does focus heavily on progressive metal, there remain many influences from other genres within the music, including some country vibes in the musicality of \"The Barrier\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2316399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316399", "title": "Yoshihiro Takayama", "text": "Yoshihiro Takayama\n\nTakayama is well known for his ability to endure massive amounts of punishment, and is regarded as one of the toughest professional wrestlers of all time. Takayama first became widely known for his toughness after he began competing in mixed martial arts, when he took part in one of the most famous fights in Pride FC history at PRIDE 21 against Don Frye. He has suffered numerous career threatening injuries, including a stroke after a match against Kensuke Sasaki in 2004. Takayama's career ended with a spinal cord injury in May 2017, which left him paralyzed from the shoulders down.\n\nA former rugby player, kendoka and lifeguard, Takayama started his professional wrestling career for shoot-style promotion Union of Wrestling Forces International (UWFI). Put under the tutelage of top star Nobuhiko Takada, Takayama debuted against Hiromitsu Kanehara and became a usual competitor of the Junior League Tournaments. In 1995, with the interpromotional feuds with New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) and WAR, he allied himself with Yoji Anjo and Kenichi Yamamoto to form the semi-serious \"Golden Cups\" stable. They competed extensively against NJPW representatives, most notably against Masahiro Chono's Ookami Gundan unit. The trio was famous for their involvement in comedic and parodic skits, like assuming masks in NJPW as the \"200% Machines\" to mock \"Super Strong Machine\" Junji Hirata, and playing a pop band gimmick to the point of releasing a CD album in July 1996. In WAR, they feuded with Gedo, Jado and Hiromichi Fuyuki, having several important matches against them.\n\nAfter UWFI's subsequent collapse, he joined Kingdom, but after it also collapsed, he joined All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) as a free agent along with former UWFi comrade Masahito Kakihara. In the beginning, Takayama was put in a feud with Toshiaki Kawada (against whom he had lost once in an interpromotional match before the UWFI's collapse), but as he lost matches often, he was back in the undercard. He and Kakihara joined former UWFI foreigner Gary Albright in a new version of the \"Triangle of Power\" stable Albright had formed with Steve Williams before he briefly went back to the United States.\n\nIn 1999, upon Giant Baba's death, Mitsuharu Misawa made him and Kakihara full-time members of All Japan. Pushed as the No Fear team with Omori, Takayama found instant success, first winning the Asian tag team title from Hayabusa and Jinsei Shinzaki and then the Double Cup from Johnny Ace and Bart Gunn. However, they were eventually defeated by the combination of Misawa and Yoshinari Ogawa. In 2000, when Misawa announced plans for his new promotion, Pro Wrestling Noah, Takayama followed him.\n\nDuring the first few months of Noah's existence, Takayama competed in the first ever GHC Heavyweight Championship tournament, but lost to Mitsuharu Misawa in the final match. He found continued success in Noah, winning the new GHC Tag Team Championship with Takao Omori, too. It was around 2001 that, spurred by his old UWFI comrades' success in the PRIDE fighting circuit, Takayama decided to try his hand at mixed martial arts competition. He also competed in memorable Noah matches during 2002, winning the GHC Heavyweight Championship from Yoshinari Ogawa on September 7 before losing it to Mitsuharu Misawa later that month.\n\nIn 2001, Takayama declared free agency from Noah so he could pursue MMA, as well as matches in New Japan Pro Wrestling, where he began challenging the top stars, such as Yuji Nagata, Masahiro Chono, and Hiroyoshi Tenzan. In 2003 and 2004 he participated in New Japan's annual G1 Climax tournament. In mid-2004 he affiliated himself with former Pancrase wrestler Minoru Suzuki, and they won the IWGP Tag Team Championship, but he suffered a stroke later in the year following a brutal match with Kensuke Sasaki. During his time away from the ring, Takayama provided occasional colour commentary for Pro Wrestling Noah, famously saying, \"I hope this never ends\" during a chop exchange between Kenta Kobashi and Kensuke Sasaki on the July 18, 2005 \"Destiny\" show. In June 2006, Pro Wrestling Noah announced that Takayama would return at the July 16 Nippon Budokan show, and would team with Kenta Kobashi to take on Jun Akiyama and Mitsuharu Misawa. The match was later changed due to Kobashi needing surgery to remove a cancerous tumor, leading to Takayama teaming with Kensuke Sasaki against Akiyama and Misawa. However, when Kenta Kobashi returned, it would be in the same match, teaming with Yoshihiro Takayama to take on Jun Akiyama and Mitsuharu Misawa.\n\nTakayama then started teaming with old UWFI comrade Takuma Sano in a tournament for the GHC Tag Team Championship vacated by Kenta Kobashi and Tamon Honda due to Kobashi's kidney tumor (Takayama and Sano would reach the final where they would lose to Muhammad Yone and Takeshi Morishima). On December 27, he showed up at a Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX show, attacked former partner Takao Omori, and promised to return at the next show.\n\nTakayama defeated Great Muta on March 14, 2009 at Pro-Wrestling Love in Ryogoku Vol. 7 to win the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship. With this victory, Takayama became the second wrestler (the other being Kensuke Sasaki) to win the three major heavyweight titles in Japan: NOAH's GHC Heavyweight Championship, New Japan's IWGP Heavyweight Championship, and All Japan's Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship. Takayama held the Triple Crown for almost seven months, losing the title to Satoshi Kojima on September 26.\nOn January 4, 2010, at Wrestle Kingdom IV in Tokyo Dome, Shinsuke Nakamura defeated Takayama to retain his IWGP Heavyweight Championship. In 2010, Takayama and Sano competed in NOAH's \"Global Tag League\" tournament and emerged the victors, however they were subsequently unable to dethrone the GHC Tag Team Champions Takeshi Rikio and Muhammad Yone.\n\nFrom March 28 to May 2, 2010, Takayama competed in (and eventually won) Pro-Wrestling Noah's 1st ever Global League. He defeated Jun Akiyama in the final match of the tournament, finishing up with a total of 7 points. It was then announced that due to his victory, Takayama had earned a GHC Heavyweight Championship match versus Takashi Sugiura on July 10. On September 18, 2010, Takayama and Takuma Sano defeated Akitoshi Saito and Bison Smith to win the vacant GHC Tag Team Championship. On January 4, 2011, at New Japan's Wrestle Kingdom V in Tokyo Dome, Takayama and Sugiura defeated Hirooki Goto and Kazuchika Okada in a tag team match. Takayama and Sano would lose the GHC Tag Team Championship to New Japan's Giant Bernard and Karl Anderson on June 18, 2011, at Dominion 6.18 in a match contested also for the IWGP Tag Team Championship. In late 2011, Takayama began making appearances for New Japan Pro Wrestling as a member of Minoru Suzuki's Suzuki-gun, which built to a match on January 4, 2012, at Wrestle Kingdom VI in Tokyo Dome, where he was defeated by Togi Makabe in a singles match. On March 18, Takayama and his Suzuki-gun stablemate, Lance Archer, unsuccessfully challenged Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Satoshi Kojima for the IWGP Tag Team Championship.\n\nIn 2016, Takayama began working primarily for DDT Pro-Wrestling, and in April 2017 won both the KO-D Tag Team Championship with Danshoku Dino and the Right to Challenge Anytime, Anywhere contract for the KO-D Openweight Championship. He lost the contract to Yasu Urano on May 4, after suffering a spinal cord injury. Because of the injury, Takayama and Dino were stripped of the KO-D Tag Team Championship on May 9.\n\nTakayama was injured at a DDT show on May 4, 2017, when he landed on his head when attempting a sunset flip on Yasu Urano. The match was ended immediately and Takayama was rushed to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with a \"cervical spinal cord injury due to degenerative cervical spondylosis\". For the following months, Takayama remained bedridden and was being taken care of by his wife and son, while the public was left unaware of the extent of his injury. On August 6, it was reported that the injury had left Takayama paralyzed from the neck down, reportedly ending his pro wrestling career. Takayama's situation was made public on September 4, when it was announced that he could now breathe on his own, but was still paralyzed from the shoulders down and was not expected to recover. DDT and Takayama's close friend Minoru Suzuki announced the creation of a foundation named \"Takayamania\", set to help Takayama and his family with his medical costs. Promotions across Japan came together to set up donation boxes for the foundation at their events.\n\nTakayama had his anticipated debut in MMA at the event PRIDE 14 against fellow professional wrestler Kazuyuki Fujita. His performance would impress pundits by keeping the fight competitive despite the experience gap, as he escaped repeatedly from underneath the heavier Fujita and exchanged hard strikes in the muay thai clinch with him in the early minutes. Even though his stamina faltered later, which allowed Fujita to deliver multiple knee strikes to the head from a grounded position, Takayama survived to the second round, where he was finally put down by an arm triangle choke.\n\nAt PRIDE 18, he faced superheavweight kickboxing champion Semmy Schilt in a valiant effort, but he was knocked out in short by his large opponent. However, Takayama would confirm the critics right at PRIDE 21 as a last time replacement. Although the event initially featured a hoped rematch between Ultimate Fighting Championship veterans Mark Coleman and Don Frye, the former was forced to pull out due to a serious neck injury, driving Takayama to accept to fill in two weeks before the bout.\n\nFrye and Takayama faced off in what many PRIDE fans consider to be a classic. As soon as the fight started, both contenders assumed an identical, aggressive hockey punching-like strategy and turned the match into a brutal slugfest, each one holding the other's head with the left hand and unloading savage unblocked punches to the face with the right. Takayama actually got the upper hand some minutes into this routine, landing several knees to the body and a belly to belly suplex, but Frye got up and both continued striking as previously, eventually taking over. At the second round, after two minutes more of punching, the American finally overpowered Takayama and pounded him with hammerfists from the mount, leading the referee to stop the match.\n\nDespite its untechnical nature, the fight was critically acclaimed and become one of the most talked about MMA matches ever. It appeared at number one on Fox Sports Network's \"Best Damn 50 Beatdowns and was considered by critics \"one of the greatest fights of all-time\", \"one of the finest moments in MMA history,\" and \"the fiercest brawl in the history of the sport\". After Takayama's retirement by paralysis in 2018, Frye published a message for him referring the fight, stating: \"Takayama-san, God gave me the greatest opponent anybody could ever ask for, you. You made the greatest fight the world has ever seen. [...] You are the warrior we all look to be.\"\n\nAt Inoki Bom-Ba-Ye 2002, Takayama had his last MMA fight as part of Antonio Inoki's team, facing an opponent even heavier than Schilt, the 350-pound Bob Sapp. The fight was one-sided, with Sapp using his superior strength and size to mount Takayama and perform an armbar for the tap out.\n\nAside from professional wrestling, Takayama featured a sporadic music career. In summer 1996, as part of Golden Cups stable, Takayama participated in the group's official music debut with the CD album \"Golden Cups Present... Oh Taco,\" containing the three wrestlers's entrance themes along with some covers and original songs. In 2009, Takayama appeared with Riki Choshu in the music video of King RIKI's tenth anniversary version of \"Love Machine\", posing as HUSTLE wrestlers flanking RIKI.\n\nTakayama has acted in small parts in several films, beginning with \"Muscle Heat\" in 2002, and continuing with \"Cromartie High - The Movie\" and \"Nagurimono\" in 2005. He also appeared in 2004's \"The Calamari Wrestler\", playing himself in a cameo role. He also voiced the character Canis Major Sirious in the \"Saint Seiya\" OVA trilogy \"The Hades Chapter\". He is credited as \"Large Man\" in Martin Scorsese's 2016 film Silence.\n\n\n"}

He has worked for CBS, ABC, CNN and MSNBC. He has served as executive producer for some of the biggest names in television news journalism, including Walter Cronkite, Peter Jennings, Ted Koppel, Diane Sawyer, Katie Couric, and Christiane Amanpour.\n\nKaplan started his broadcast journalism career at CBS's WBBM-TV in Chicago. He worked for CBS until 1979, when he moved to ABC. Kaplan stayed at ABC until 1997, when he served as President of CNN/U.S. until 2000. He became Senior Vice-President of ABC News in 2003 and was named President of MSNBC in February 2004. In June 2006 Kaplan resigned as president of MSNBC. In 2007, he replaced Rome Hartman as the executive producer of the \"CBS Evening News with Katie Couric\". In 2011, he was named executive producer of \"This Week with Christiane Amanpour\"., and was put in charge of ABC News political coverage and 2012 election coverage and specials.

He graduated from the University of Illinois. He was a member of Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity at the University of Illinois.\n\nKaplan's broadcast journalism career began at CBS News, where he served as an associate producer of \"CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite\" (1974–79) and an associate producer of the \"CBS Morning News\" (1971–74). He was a writer, assignment desk editor and producer at WBBM-TV, the CBS-owned station in Chicago (1969–71). As an associate producer for \"CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite\", he produced news coverage of the American political campaigns and elections in 1974, 1976 and 1978. He was also a producer of the historic visit of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to Israel for his first meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.\n\nKaplan joined ABC News in 1979 as a senior producer for \"World News Tonight with Peter Jennings\". From 1979 to 1997, Kaplan held a variety of positions at ABC News and the ABC Television Network.\n\nPrior to joining \"Nightline\", Kaplan was executive producer of \"World News This Morning\" and \"Good Morning America\" news.\n\nKaplan was executive producer of \"ABC News Nightline\" from 1984 to 1989, where he guided the late-night news program through a period of innovation and exclusive interviews. While at \"Nightline\" in March 1985, Kaplan produced the historic week-long series of broadcasts originating from Johannesburg, South Africa. In 1988, Kaplan was executive producer of \"Nightline in the Holy Land\", a critically acclaimed week-long series examining Arab–Israeli conflicts. At that time he was also responsible for an unprecedented four-hour \"Nightline National Town Meeting\" on AIDS, the most comprehensive coverage of the epidemic ever shown on network television.\n\nAfter a stint during the 1980s as executive producer of ABC's \"Nightline\", Kaplan was promoted to executive producer of ABC's \"Primetime Live\".\n\nPrior to that Kaplan was the creator and executive producer of the ABC News magazine, \"Primetime Live\" from 1989 to 1994. The program became one of the leading news magazines on television, regularly finishing in the top ten of all programs in his final three years there. The trademark of \"Primetime Live\" became investigative journalism with award-winning broadcasts focusing on child care, racism in the United States, slavery in the Caribbean, unsanitary and dishonest food handling by the major grocery chain Food Lion and the abuse of patients seeking pap smears and mammograms. \"Primetime Live\" also distinguished itself in its on-the-scene live coverage of such landmark news events as the Gulf War, the historic opening of the Berlin Wall, the 1989 San Francisco earthquake and the 1992 Los Angeles riots. In 1990, he produced exclusive tour of the White House and the Kremlin for \"Primetime Live\", and later produced ABC's exclusive coverage of the final days of Mikhail Gorbachev’s presidency. At the same time he produced \"Primetime Live\", Kaplan was one of the producers and on-scene coordinators of the ABC News coverage of the Gulf War from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. In September 1991, he was the executive producer of the historic ABC News Town Meeting in which Soviet leaders Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin appeared together live from the Kremlin, to answer questions from Americans viewing in studios in cities across America. Prior to joining \"Primetime Live\", Kaplan created and was executive producer of \"Capital to Capital\", a series of programs which marked the first live exchanges between members of Congress and high-ranking officials at the Kremlin. He was also the executive producer of \"Viewpoint\", the ABC News forum for criticism and analysis of broadcast journalism and of \"The Koppel Report\".\n\nIn 1991 \"Primetime Live\" aired an exposé of the Food Lion supermarket chain where undercover reporters posed as employees, falsifying their resumes and staging events. The exposé depicted Food Lion as an unethical seller of outdated and contaminated foods. Food Lion sued, and a jury that saw the 45 hours of video from which Kaplan and ABC distilled a 10-minute hit piece awarded Food Lion $5.5 million in punitive damages for fraud committed by Capital Cities-ABC against the company. The award was later reduced by a judge to $316,000. The verdict was then overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia. According to the court, even though ABC was wrong to do what they had done, they felt that Food Lion was unable to show that they had been directly injured by ABC's actions.\n\nWhile executive producer of ABC's \"PrimeTime Live,\" Kaplan in 1992 advised then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton how to deal with the Gennifer Flowers affair issue, recommended that the Clintons appear on rival CBS program \"60 Minutes,\" and advised the Clintons on how to handle that interview.\n\nIn January 1994, Kaplan became executive producer of \"World News Tonight with Peter Jennings\" and was responsible for the direction and overall editorial content of the most watched evening news program in the nation. Under Kaplan's direction in 1994, \"World News Tonight\" broadcast live from the beaches of Normandy for the 50th anniversary of D-Day and in a series of special news broadcasts from the Middle East, produced the first live program from the Gaza Strip.\n\nHe served as executive producer of special projects for ABC. In this post, Kaplan created and produced special programming for all of the network's divisions, including news, entertainment and sports.\n\nAs President of CNN-US, Kaplan was responsible for all news and programming at the flagship network of the CNN News Group. He instituted a new class of instant news specials, revamped the network's programming line-up with a new program schedule and anchor teams, and increased the number of hours of hard news programming during the weekends.\n\nUnder Kaplan, CNN/U.S. galvanized its ability to provide worldwide viewership with the most extensive and up-to-the-minute live coverage and analysis of both breaking and on-going news events, as evidenced in the unprecedented 100 hours of live, global Millennium 2000 coverage, the award-winning Investigating the President series of CNN Special Reports, the 1998 off-year election coverage, John Glenn’s return to space, the \"Showdown with Iraq\" series of CNN Special Reports, the week-long series entitled Ground Zero on nuclear proliferation, and various timely news specials on topics including the NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia, the Littleton, Colorado school shootings, the effects of El Niño in 1997 and the network’s groundbreaking series of town hall meetings, including \"Investigating the President: Media Madness?\" He also played a major role in the planning and execution of CNN’s Campaign 2000 coverage, producing four multi-candidate primary debates, including the Bradley-Gore debate at Harlem’s Apollo Theater. Kaplan also produced all of CNN’s prime time coverage of both the 2000 Republican and Democratic National Conventions.\n\nIn 1998, Kaplan oversaw production of the first documentary for the new show \"NewsStand\". The documentary called \"Tailwind,\" narrated by journalist Peter Arnett, alleged that during the Vietnam War the United States had used sarin gas against women and children in Laos. This report was later discredited and CNN was vilified by the U.S. Department of Defense and many veteran's groups.\n\nKaplan repeatedly clashed with CNN anchor Lou Dobbs and was presumed responsible for his abrupt departure from the network in 1999.\n\nOn April 20, 1999, CNN was covering President Clinton's speech in Littleton, Colorado, following the Columbine High School massacre. Dobbs ordered the producer to cut away from the speech and return to broadcast \"Moneyline\". Dobbs was countermanded by Kaplan, who ordered CNN to return to the speech. Kaplan later said, \"Tell me what journalistic reason there was not to cover the president at Columbine soon after the shootings? Everyone else was doing it.\" Dobbs announced on the air that \"CNN President Rick Kaplan wants us to return to Littleton.\" A few days later, Dobbs announced that he was leaving the network to start a website devoted to astronautical news.\n\nAfter Kaplan moved to CNN, \"U.S. News & World Report\" found that Kaplan had ordered CNN reporters to \"limit the use of the word 'scandal' in reporting on President Clinton's campaign fundraising.\" Critics claim this as an example of bias, given Kaplan's longtime friendship with him.\n\nKaplan was senior vice president of ABC News in June 2003. In this position he oversaw the news division's hard news programs, which include \"World News Tonight\", \"Nightline\", \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos\", \"World News Tonight Saturday\" and \"Sunday\", \"World News Now\", \"World News This Morning\" as well as ABC News’ Political Unit. Kaplan led the team that developed ABC News’ much acclaimed 2004 Campaign Buses. Three extra large buses that were outfitted with three live cameras, a six-person live studio, two edit rooms, radio studio, completely Internet friendly with a transmission room allowing it to feed to satellites from anywhere in the country. He also was responsible for overseeing the team which designed and constructed ABC's new newsroom and primary studio and led the design team which redesigned the networks 2004 election graphics and logo. Kaplan was appointed senior vice president after he was brought back to ABC News to coordinate the network's control room production and news coverage of America's War with Iraq. This coverage began with a much acclaimed three-hour ABC News Special: \"When Diplomacy Fails\" produced by Kaplan the evening of President Bush's final address to the nation before hostilities began. Across the next four weeks more than 200 hours of live coverage was aired.\n\nPrior to this, Kaplan was a teaching fellow at the Shorenstein Center of Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. He spent the next two years lecturing there and at a number of universities across the country.\n\nKaplan was named . During his tenure ratings for virtually every hour of the program day rose double digit numbers 24% in daytime, 27% in primetime and across 2005-2006 grew 67% in audience share. He developed new programs such as \"The Most with Alison Stewart\", and \"The Situation with Tucker Carlson\". Kaplan worked to define existing programming such as \"Hardball with Chris Matthews\" and \"Countdown with Keith Olbermann\" to capture their highest ratings in history. He is credited with stabilizing the previously volatile MSNBC schedule, improving daily news coverage and the better coordination of the cable-broadcast network news assets. He also produced major news events including Election Night 2004 and \"A Concert for Hurricane Relief\".\n\nKaplan was named executive producer of the \"CBS Evening News with Katie Couric\" in March 2007. In revamping this evening newscast he produced multiple hours of special political and election coverage which included series such as Primary Questions and Presidential Questions, which gave viewers a chance to hear all the candidates answer a series of character and life questions and hear those answers in the same broadcast. He also planned and produced extensive issue reports acclaimed for their depth of content, and a series of candidate interviews which included the game changing Katie Couric interviews with Sarah Palin.\n\nKaplan was the executive producer responsible for all aspects and production of the 2008 Political Conventions in Denver and Minneapolis, 2008 Election Night and the 2009 Inauguration of Barack Obama. He also produced coverage of the shootings at Virginia Tech and the decisions at the conclusion of the rape case at Duke. In Spring 2007 he moved the broadcast to Baghdad and Damascus for a week of programs which took a first look at the progress made by the \"surge\" and originated from across the country. The program then proceeded to Syria and was highlighted by an enlightening rare interview with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Kaplan was named interim executive producer of \"The Early Show\" for 10 weeks (which he ran while also EP-ing the Evening News) as it struggled through a period of readjustment due to a personnel change. During this time the program grew in household ratings by 8%...key demographics by 30%...and produced a week of programming live from Greensburg, Kansas, a town destroyed in 2007 by an EF5 tornado that rebuilt itself one year later.\n\nIn 2011, Kaplan was named executive producer of ABC News' \"This Week With Christiane Amanpour\", and put in charge of political coverage and 2012 election coverage and specials in May 2011.\n\nKaplan founded KAPLAN MEDIA PARTNERS in August 2012, a company dedicated to producing quality news programming as either a network consultant or contractor and structured to assist private industry as it navigates the new world of social media while meeting the challenges of dealing with mainstream media. KMP also delivers media training, crisis management and works with firms who are looking to increase their influence with groundbreaking conferences and intra-corporate communications.\n\nKaplan Media Partners' first client was Aaron Sorkin and the HBO program, \"The Newsroom\", where Kaplan was hired to be a creative consultant beginning with Season 2. Writing began in September 2012.\n\nKaplan has devoted a great deal of his time to education, teaching a series of special journalism classes every semester since 1993 at the University of Illinois College Of Communications in Urbana–Champaign. In 1999 Kaplan received an honorary Doctor of Letters from The University of Illinois, his alma mater. He also teaches various journalism classes and has widely taught and lectured at universities across the country; including Duke University, Columbia University, Cornell, Wellesley, Boston College, Columbia College, USC, Berkeley, and the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nKaplan has received numerous awards for his work, including 44 Emmy Awards, four Overseas Press Club Awards, three Peabody Awards, two George Polk Awards, four Ohio State Awards, four Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Awards, two Gold Batons, twelve National Headliner Awards, eight CINE Eagles for Journalistic Excellence and the Distinguished Service award and Bronze Medallion from the Society of Professional Journalists, Sigma Delta Chi. In 2008 Kaplan was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by Westfield State College.\n\nIn January 2001, Kaplan was chosen to be the visiting Lombard Lecturer at the Shorenstein Center for Press, Politics and Public Policy of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. His course \"Politics and Public Policy 359: Do American Media Meet the Needs of a Modern Democracy?\" included graduate students as well as underclassmen.\n\nIn September 2001 Kaplan was asked to remain at Harvard for the complete academic year, where he was named a Fellow of the Shorenstein Center. In August 2003 Kaplan was awarded the appointment of adjunct Fellow at the Shorenstein Center where he continues to consult and lecture.\n"}

D. Payne. The story is told in a picaresque fashion and makes heavy use of black humor and camp. The book contains parts one through three of an eleven-part series (the three sequential parts were published as three separate books).\n\nThe book's main protagonist is Nicholas \"Nick\" Twisp, a 14-year-old boy of above-average intelligence from Oakland, California. Nick's life continues like a normal teenager's with his best friend Leroy, a.k.a. Lefty, and his divorced parents George and Estelle. His mother is dating a truck driver named Jerry, who sells a group of sailors a Chevy Nova that dies soon after the sailors get it. In response, the sailors go for revenge. After outsmarting them, Jerry strategically decides to take a vacation, so they all go to a religious mobile home camp in the resort town of Clearlake.\n\nIt is there that Nick meets Sheridan \"Sheeni\" Saunders and his life is turned completely upside down. Through plots to get Sheeni closer to him he ends up with several crimes on his hands (including arson, grand theft auto, and foul play) and is forced to run from the police. Nick tricks everyone into thinking he went to India, thereby escaping the police. Nick hides out with his sister Joanie and returns with help from his friend in Ukiah, Frank \"Fuzzy\" DeFalco. He dresses in Fuzzy's late grandmother's clothes, adopting the name Carlotta and a conservative disposition. As Nick does so, he befriends Sheeni and several other people who Nick knew before. While spending the night with Sheeni on Christmas Eve, she reveals to him that she knew from the beginning it was him, not Carlotta. Nick then gets \"the best Christmas present a youth could receive,\" starting a secret relationship with Sheeni.\n\nNick inherits a fortune when an elderly neighbor of Joanie takes a liking to him and decides to put him in her will. When Joanie's neighbor died, Nick is briefly left half a million dollars richer, until his mother's boyfriend, a somewhat corrupt police officer, seizes the money. Faced with homelessness from the loss of the house he had been squatting in, Nick becomes rich beyond belief when an idea of his, a wart watch, makes it big.\n\n\nThe original book has eight sequels, for a total of ten books. \n\nAdditionally, \"Cut to the Twisp: The Lost Parts of Youth In Revolt and Other Stories\" features all of the material that was edited out of post-1993 editions of the first three volumes that make up \"Youth in Revolt\", as well as other short works by Payne.\n\n\"Youth in Revolt\" was adapted into an unsuccessful stage play in 1994 by Carl Hamilton and Bob Warden of Box Car Productions. It had its premier at the Cable Car Theater in San Francisco in 1994. It has also been produced in Denver and several locations throughout Northern California with greater success. It is based on the first book, \"Youth in Revolt\".\n\nIn 1998, MTV and Fox television worked together on a television show based on the book. A pilot was filmed, but it was never developed further.\n\nIn March 2004, a film adaptation of the book was announced, written by Gustin Nash and directed by Miguel Arteta. Michael Cera stars in the role of Nick Twisp, newcomer Portia Doubleday plays Sheeni Saunders, Ray Liotta is Lance Wescott, Jean Smart is Estelle Twisp, Steve Buscemi is George Twisp, and Erik Knudsen is Leroy \"Lefty\". Justin Long plays Paul Saunders, Sheeni's older brother. The movie was filmed in Michigan. The locations were Royal Oak, Michigan, Rochester, Michigan, Frankfort, Lake Leelanau RV Park, Interlochen, Lake Ann, Ferndale, Detroit, South Lyon, Ann Arbor, Wixom, Brighton, and Hazel Park. It was released on January 8, 2010.\n"}
{"id": "2316437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316437", "title": "Agrippina Vaganova", "text": "Agrippina Vaganova\n\nAgrippina Yakovlevna Vaganova (; 26 June 1879 – 5 November 1951) was a Russian Armenian ballet teacher who developed the Vaganova method – the technique which derived from the teaching methods of the old \"Imperial Ballet School\" (today the \"Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet\") under the \"Premier Maître de Ballet\" Marius Petipa throughout the mid to late 19th century, though mostly throughout the 1880s and 1890s. It was Vaganova who perfected and cultivated this form of teaching the art of classical ballet into a workable syllabus. Her \"Fundamentals of the Classical Dance\" (1934) remains a standard textbook for the instruction of ballet technique. Her technique is one of the most popular techniques today.\n\nVaganova was born in Saint Petersburg to Akop Vaganov, an Armenian from Astrakhan, who worked as an usher at the Mariinsky Theatre, and a Russian mother.\n\nVaganova's whole life was connected with the Imperial Ballet (later the Kirov Ballet) of the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg. She was accepted into the Imperial Ballet School in 1888, the great institution of classical dance founded by Anna of Russia and funded by the Tsars. She graduated from the \"Classe de Perfection\" of the former \"Prima Ballerina\" Eugeniia Sokolova (she was also trained by Ekaterina Vazem, Christian Johansson, Lev Ivanov, Nikolai Legat and Pavel Gerdt).\n\nBallet did not come easily to Vaganova in her first years as a student, but slowly, through the efforts of her own will power, she was able to join the illustrious Imperial Ballet upon her graduation. By the time she attained the rank of soloist, Saint Petersburg balletomanes dubbed her \"queen of variations\", for her unlimited virtuosity and level of technique.\n\nThe old Maestro Petipa cared little for Vaganova as a dancer – any mention of her performances in his diaries was usually followed by such comments as \"awful\" or \"dreadful\". In 1915 the Ballet Master Nikolai Legat cast Vaganova as the Goddess Niriti in his revival of Petipa's 1889 grand ballet \"The Talisman\". Vaganova's portrayal was a great success, and won her promotion to the rank of \"Prima\". Nevertheless, she chose to retire one year later to concentrate on teaching.\n\nShe started to teach ballet in 1916 at the School of the Baltic Fleet which was founded and led by Akim Volynsky. In 1921 Vaganova began teaching at the \"Choreographic College\", so at that time was called the former Imperial Theater School situated on Rossi street (after the revolution ballet department was separated from the Drama and Music). Though she did have a respectable career as a dancer, her leadership in teaching classical dance was what gave her one of the most respected places in the history of ballet. Her own early struggle with deciphering ballet technique had taught her much. She taught students who would go on to become legends of the dance.\n\nAfter the Revolution of 1917 the future of ballet in Russia looked grim because of its tradition as court entertainment. Vaganova \"\"fought tooth and nail\"\", as she put it, for the preservation of the legacy of Marius Petipa and the Imperial Ballet. From 1931 to 1937 she was an artistic director of the ballet of the Leningrad Opera and Ballet Theater (Kirov Ballet). In 1933, she staged the classical version of \"Swan Lake\" by Lev Ivanov and Marius Petipa with Galina Ulanova as Odette, Olga Jordan as Odile and Konstantin Sergeyev as Prince Siegfried. In 1935 she revived La Esmeralda partly with her own choreography.\n\nIn 1934 she published her famous book \"Fundamentals of Classical Dance\": it has withstood at least six editions in Russia and was translated into many languages. The same year Vaganova (along with Boris Shavrov) initiated the establishing at the Leningrad Conservatory of pedagogic department for training of future ballet teachers which she began to manage. There, some of her dance school alumni became her students. Most important names for the dance teaching are Vera Kostrovitskaya (author of \"100 lessons of classical dance\"), Nadezhda Bazarova and Varvara P. Mey (authors of the \"Alphabet of Classical Dance\").\n\nAmong Vaganova's dance alumnae were the distinguished Soviet ballerinas Marina Semyonova, Olga Jordan, Galina Ulanova, Tatiana Vecheslova, Feya Balabina, Natalia Dudinskaya, Galina Kirillova, Alla Shelest, Ninel Petrova, Nonna Yastrebova, Olga Moiseeva, Ludmilla Safronova, Ninel Kurgapkina, Alla Ossipenko and Irina Kolpakova among many others.\n\nHer teaching combined the elegant, refined style of the old French School which Vaganova had been taught by Christian Johansson, the beauty and smoothness of the arms movements of old Russian School, strong and masterly feet technique of Italian School with more vigorous dancing developed in the Soviet Union. Her last school graduation was in 1951 — not long before her death.\n\nShe also taught the class of perfection for the female dancers of the Kirov Ballet for many years till 1951, when Natalia Dudinskaya succeed her as teacher.\nShortly after her death, on 1 November 1957, the Choreographic College on Rossi Street was renamed in her honor; in 1961, it received the title of \"academic\" and in 1991 it began to use the name Agrippina Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet.\n\n\n"}

He graduated from Vanderbilt University in 1925.\n\nLytle's first literary success came as a result of his association with the Southern Agrarians, a movement whose members included poets Robert Penn Warren and Allen Tate, whom Lytle knew from Vanderbilt University. The group of poets, novelists and writers published the 1930s \"I'll Take My Stand\", which expressed their philosophy. The work was attacked by contemporaries and current scholars believe it to be a reactionary and romanticized defense of the Old South and the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. It ignored slavery and denounced \"progress\", for example, and some critics considered it to be moved by nostalgia\n\nIn 1948, Lytle helped start the Master of Fine Arts program at the University of Florida.\n\nLytle first published a biography of Nathan Bedford Forrest, the Confederate general of the American Civil War: \"Bedford Forrest and his Critter Company\" (1931). Lytle went on to write more than a dozen books, including novels, collected short stories, and collections of essays on literary and cultural topics.\n\nMost critics consider \"The Velvet Horn\" (1957) to be Lytle's best work. It was nominated for the National Book Award for fiction. His 1973 memoir, \"A Wake For The Living\", is a \"tour-de-force\" in Southern storytelling, combining a deep religious sensibility, an expansive view of history that links events across decades and even centuries, and—sometimes—bawdy family tales.\n\nLytle served as editor of the \"Sewanee Review\" from 1961 to 1973 while he was a professor at the University of the South. During Lytle's tenure, the \"Review\" became one of the nation's most prestigious literary magazines. Lytle was an early champion of Flannery O'Connor's work. Lytle encouraged many writers, including Allen Tate and Robert Penn Warren, but also Elizabeth Bishop, Caroline Gordon, and Robert Lowell. His insightful criticism often improved their work.\n\nLytle taught literature and creative writing at the University of Florida, where he had Madison Jones and Harry Crews as students.\n\nThough Lytle retired from the University of the South in 1973, he never fully retired from either writing or teaching. In the last years of his life, he had what he called the \"great pleasure\" of seeing most of his earlier books come back into print. Several university presses published collections of his stories and essays.\n\nLytle was the owner of Cornsilk, a historic house in Cross Plains, Tennessee, in the 1940s. He died on December 13, 1995, in Monteagle, Tennessee, and was buried at the University of the South Cemetery, Sewanee, Tennessee.\n\nLytle Street in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, is named in his memory.\n\n\n"}

The original release, \"Weird War II: Blood on the Rhine\" was set during World War II, and utilized the D20 System. The second release, \"Tour of Darkness\" was set during the Vietnam War and employed the \"Savage Worlds\" rules set. \nA third release, also for \"Savage Worlds\", \"Necropolis\" was set in the future on a war-torn planet.\n\nIn the original \"Weird War II\", players play as Allied soldiers during the Second World War. The setting presents a supernatural element, and characters face (and drive) haunted vehicles, fight mutant Nazi soldiers and investigate the supernatural. Heroes who face the supernatural can be offered membership in the Office of Supernatural Investigations (OSI), which then allows them to take the OSI Chaplain and OSI Adept Prestige Classes (which grant access to Divine and Arcane Magic respectively). Magic is handled differently in this setting than in other d20 settings, being cast by means of Runes and causing Fatigue to the caster.\n\nHitler and his Nazis have their own magic-users: Blood Mages, who can be amongst the toughest foes the players later face.\n\nBlood Mages are essentially Adepts of Evil Alignment, which grants them the power to draw upon the 'innate evil' of places such as Death Camps and battlefields. Because the only difference between a Blood Mage and an Adept is Alignment, it is possible to play an Allied Blood Mage, though not recommended, as both the OSI and the Sons of Solomon (a secret organization devoted to hiding the supernatural) will come after them if they are discovered.\n\nMagic is low-powered in this setting; Mages only receive spells up to the 5th level, and the only offensive powers in their arsenal are Magic Missile and Cloudkill, which blend in better with the chaos of the battlefield, mimicking bullets and clouds of poison gas respectively.\n\nThe books in the setting are:\n\n"}

The group is also associated with other major French hip hop artists such as Doc Gyneco and Hamed Daye. The group's name means 'ministry of action, music and rap'. Also 'amer' means 'bitter'.\n\nTheir first single, \"Traîtres\", was released in 1991, and it was followed by the album \"Pourquoi tant de haine?\" in 1991. The second album, \"95200\", came out in 1994. In 1995, after their song \"Sacrifice de poulet\", which appeared on the disc La Haine inspired by the film \"of the same name\", provoked the French Minister of the Interior, Charles Pasqua, to attack the group in court. The court's ruling forced the group to pay 250,000 francs of fines, but Mr Pasqua's demands for banning sales of Ministère AMER's discs were unsuccessful. However, radio stations were reluctant to play their music after this incident, and the only station who continued to do so was Generation 88.2, an underground parisian station dedicated to hip hop music.\n\nMembers of the band began to pursue solo careers after the release of their second album, and Stomy Bugsy released his first solo album \"Le calibre qu'il te faut\" in 1997. Passi also released \"Les tentations\" the same year. After the success these albums enjoyed, Kenzy created the record label Secteur Ä to accommodate Ministère AMER and other hip hop artists, such as Nèg' Marrons, Ärsenik, Doc Gynéco, Hamed Daye, and Tandem.\n\nIn 1997, the group's two albums were re-released as a limited edition double album.

He married Agnes Daubeny and they had one child, Sir Richard Waldegrave.\n\nSir Richard Waldegrave (or Walgrave), Knt., of Smallbridge, Suffolk, (died 2 May 1401), was member of parliament for Lincolnshire in 1335, and Speaker of the House of Commons in the reign of King Richard II; his son, Sir Richard Waldegrave, Knt., (died 2 May 1434), styled Lord of Bures and Silvesters, was the victor of Conquet and the Isle of Rhé in Brittany in 1402.\n\nSir William Waldegrave (c. 1415–1461), was born in Smallbridge. He married Joane Doreward and they had two sons—Sir Thomas Waldegrave, and Richard Waldegrave.\n\nOne of Sir Richard's descendants was Sir Edward Waldegrave (c. 15171 September 1561) of Borley, Essex, and West Haddon, Northamptonshire, who was imprisoned during the reign of King Edward VI for his loyalty to the princess, afterwards Queen Mary. By Mary he was knighted, and he received from her the manor of Chewton in Somerset, now the residence of Earl Waldegrave. He was a member of parliament and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. After Mary's decease he suffered a reverse of fortune, and he was a prisoner in the Tower of London when he died on 1 September 1561.\n\nSir Edward's descendant, another Sir Edward Waldegrave was created a baronet in 1643 for his services to King Charles I; and his descendant, Sir Henry Waldegrave, Bart. (166124 January 1689), was created Baron Waldegrave, of Chewton in 1686. Sir Henry married Henrietta FitzJames (16673 April 1730), daughter of King James II by his mistress Arabella Churchill; their son was James Waldegrave, 1st Earl Waldegrave (1684–1741).\n\nEducated in France, James Waldegrave soon crossed over to England, and under King George I he declared himself a Protestant and took his seat as Baron Waldegrave in the House of Lords. Having become friendly with Sir Robert Walpole, he was sent to Paris as ambassador extraordinary in 1725, and from 1727 to 1730 he was British ambassador at Vienna. In 1729 he was created Viscount Chewton and Earl Waldegrave, and in 1730 he succeeded Sir Horatio Walpole as ambassador in Paris, filling this post during ten very difficult years. He died in April 1741. Much of his diplomatic correspondence is in the British Museum.\n\nHis son James, the 2nd earl (1715–1763), was perhaps the most intimate friend of King George II, and was for a time governor of his grandson, the future King George III. He was very much in evidence during the critical years 1755–1757, when the king employed him to negotiate in turn with Newcastle, Devonshire, Pitt and Fox about the formation of a ministry. Eventually, in consequence of a deadlock, Waldegrave himself was First Lord of the Treasury for five days in June 1757. He died on 28 April 1763, leaving some valuable and interesting Memoirs, which were published in 1821.\n\nHis brother John, the 3rd earl (1718–1784), was a soldier, who distinguished himself especially at the Battle of Minden and became a general in 1772. He was a member of parliament from 1747 to 1763.\n\nHis younger son, William (1753–1825), entered the British navy in 1766, and after many years of service was third in command at the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1797. In 1800 he was created an Irish peer as Baron Radstock, and in 1802 he became an admiral. His son, Granville George (1786–1857), followed in his father's footsteps, and was made a vice-admiral in 1851. In 1857 his son, Granville Augustus William (born 1833), became 3rd Baron Radstock, settling at the Mayfield estate in Woolston and undertaking missionary work in Russia \n\nGeorge Waldegrave, 4th Earl Waldegrave (1751–1789), the eldest son of the 3rd earl, was a soldier and a member of parliament. His sons, George (1784–1794) and John James (1785–1835), were the 5th and 6th earls.\n\nIn 1797 the 6th earl inherited from Horace Walpole his famous residence, Strawberry Hill, Twickenham (hence the name of Waldegrave Road, which connects Strawberry Hill with Teddington), but his son, George Edward, the 7th earl (1816–1846), was obliged in 1842 to sell the valuable treasures collected there. His wife, Frances, Countess Waldegrave (1821–1879), a daughter of the singer John Braham, was a prominent figure in society. He was her second husband, and after his death she married George Granville Vernon Harcourt of Nuneham Park, Oxfordshire, and later Chichester Parkinson-Fortescue, 1st Baron Carlingford.\n\nThe 7th earl was succeeded by his uncle William (1788–1859), a son of the 4th earl, and in 1859 William's grandson, William Frederick (1851–1930), became the 9th earl.\n\n\n\n"}

Trent remained editor-in-chief of the review until 1900.\n\nAfter a number of short-term editors, George Herbert Clarke took over in 1920. Clarke was the first editor to publish poetry. Clarke remained editor until 1926 and was succeeded by William S. Knickerbocker, who published the first piece of fiction in the magazine.\n\nIn 1942, Tudor Seymour Long became editor, with Andrew Nelson Lytle serving as managing editor and Allen Tate as an advisory editor and \"de facto\" editor until 1944. In 1944, when Tate took over as editor, he and Lytle revolutionized the magazine's place in American letters. It focused on New Criticism, alongside Cleanth Brooks's \"Southern Review\" and John Crowe Ransom's \"The Kenyon Review\". Tate also had the magazine redesigned by P. J. Conkwright, who crafted the distinctive blue cover and design.\n\nWhen Tate's editorship ended in 1946, John E. Palmer became editor. He was followed by Monroe K. Spears in 1952 and then Andrew Lytle again in 1965. George Core succeeded Lytle in 1973. After 43 years as editor, Core retired in 2016, and the novelist Adam Ross was appointed to succeed him. Early in Ross's tenure, the cover was redesigned by graphic artists Oliver Munday and Peter Mendelsund, the associate art director at Alfred A. Knopf. This marked the magazine's first new cover in over 70 years.\n\nThe review gives the annual Aiken Taylor Award, a prize of $10,000, begun in 1985 by the physician and poet K. P. A.

{"id": "2316478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316478", "title": "Gossip (video game)", "text": "Gossip (video game)\n\nGossip is a video game created for the Atari 8-bit family by then-Atari, Inc. employee Chris Crawford. The documentation indicates that \"Gossip\" is an Atari Program Exchange title, but it was not listed in any of the published catalogs and may not have been released at all.\n\nCrawford wished for video games that would simulate aspects of human social interaction via “social challenges.” He hoped these \"people games\" would appeal to those who were not interested in the more common gaming genres of combat and sports. Although the social interactions in Gossip are relatively simple, Crawford contends that they are comparable to the level of complexity found in \"The Sims\".\n\nThe majority of the screen is taken up with eight characters: You, Val, Jim, Liz, Amy, Dan, Sue and Tom. The player uses a joystick cursor to select a character to telephone. That person’s phone rings with a jiggling animation and ringing sound effect. He or she picks up the phone and says, “Air-oh?” The player selects a person to gossip about, and then one of five expressive animations (strong positive, slight positive, neutral, slight negative, strong negative). The listener responds with his or her own opinion of the person.\n\nThe social interactions he chose for this experimental simulation were declarations of affinity (e.g. “I like Fred,” “I hate Jane”). The theory behind the simulation was that people liked those who shared their opinions of others, and were also influenced positively by their friends’ opinions and negatively by their enemies’ opinions. Such declarations, Crawford said, were implicit in many pieces of gossip. He produced the following mathematical model:\n\nformula_1\n\nformula_2\n\nwhere \"x\" is \"a\"’s actual opinion of \"b\",\n\"x'\" is \"a\"’s declared opinion of \"b\", \"l\" is the listener, \"s\" is the speaker, \"o\" is the object (the person being gossiped about), k and k are constants greater than 1 (Crawford gave the hypothetical value of 10, but did not specify the actual values used in the game).\n\nThe AI characters did not perform discrete interactions with each other. They instead acted as nodes in a web of springs, trying to reduce the tension around them. The original game engine was written in Atari BASIC and took hours to complete the calculations for a single turn. Two major attempts were made to rewrite the system in assembler language, which reduced the calculation time to a few moments.\n\nOne issue that was not addressed was sincerity. Also, it did not account for the fact that repeating the same statement too many times would eventually reduce its effect.\n\nAlthough Crawford was proud of this game, he never developed a structure of goals and never published it. The two developers that worked on the assembler versions had a different opinion, calling it boring. Although they raised this point during development, it was said that Crawford would simply state that if they understood the concept they would know it would be fun. One of the developers quit the project due to this attitude.\n\nCrawford applied a similar social model in \"Excalibur\" for the management of the Knights of the Round Table and diplomacy with the other kings of England.\n\nIn 2013 Crawford publicly released the source code of several of his games, including \"Gossip\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2316511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316511", "title": "Henry rifle", "text": "Henry rifle\n\nThe Henry repeating rifle is a lever-action tubular magazine rifle famed both for its use at the Battle of the Little Bighorn and being the basis for the iconic Winchester rifle of the American Wild West.\n\nDesigned by Benjamin Tyler Henry in 1860, the original Henry was a sixteen shot .44 caliber rimfire breech-loading lever-action rifle. It was introduced in the early 1860s and produced through 1866 in the United States by the New Haven Arms Company. The Henry was adopted in small quantities by the Union in the Civil War, favored for its greater firepower than the standard issue carbine. Many later found their way West, notably in the hands of the Sioux and Cheyenne in their obliteration of Custer's U.S. Cavalry troops in June 1876.\n\nModern replicas are produced by A. Uberti Firearms and Henry Repeating Arms. Most are chambered in .44-40 Winchester or .45 Long Colt.\n\nThe original Henry rifle was a sixteen shot .44 caliber rimfire breech-loading lever-action rifle, patented by Benjamin Tyler Henry in 1860 after three years of design work. The Henry was an improved version of the earlier Volition, and later Volcanic. The Henry used copper (later brass) rimfire cartridges with a 216 grain (14.0 gram, 0.490 ounce) bullet over 25 grains (1.6 g, 0.056 oz.) of black powder. \n\nOnly 150 to 200 rifles a month were initially produced. Nine hundred were manufactured between summer and October 1862. Production peaked at 290 per month by 1864, bringing the total to 8,000. By the time the run ended in 1866, approximately 14,000 units had been manufactured.\n\nFor a Civil War soldier, owning a Henry rifle was a point of pride. Letters home would call them \"Sixteen\" or \"Seventeen\"-shooters, depending whether a round was loaded in the chamber. Just 1,731 of the standard rifles were purchased by the government during the Civil War. The Commonwealth of Kentucky purchased a further 50. However 6,000 to 7,000 saw use by the Union on the field through private purchases by soldiers who could afford it. The relative fragility of Henrys compared to Spencers hampered their official acceptance. Another weak point for the Henry was that it could not be equipped with a bayonet. Many infantry soldiers purchased Henrys with their reenlistment bounties of 1864. Most of these units were associated with Sherman's Western troops.\n\nWhen used correctly, the brass-receiver rifles had an exceptionally high rate of fire compared to any other weapon on the battlefield. Soldiers who saved their pay to buy one believed it would help save their lives. Since tactics had not been developed to take advantage of their firepower, Henrys were frequently used by scouts, skirmishers, flank guards, and raiding parties rather than in regular infantry formations. Confederate Colonel John Mosby, who became infamous for his sudden raids against advanced Union positions, when first encountering the Henry in battle called it \"that damned Yankee rifle that can be loaded on Sunday and fired all week.\" Since then that phrase became associated with the Henry rifle. Those few Confederate troops who came into possession of captured Henry rifles had little way to resupply the ammunition it used, making its widespread use by Confederate forces impractical. The rifle was, however, known to have been used at least in part by some Confederate units in Louisiana, Texas, and Virginia, as well as the personal bodyguards of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. According to firearms historian Herbert G. Houze, one man armed with a Henry rifle was the equivalent of 14 or 15 men equipped with single-shot guns.\n\nHenry's rifle was probably used in the January Uprising by Count Jan Kanty Dzialynski in the Battle of Ignacew. In the memoirs from the epoch, it is reported that Dzialynski was shooting from a 16-shot rifle during the battle. Another user of Henry's rifle in the January Uprising was Paul Garnier d'Aubin, officer of the French 23rd Infantry Regiment.\n\nThe Henry rifle used a .44 caliber cartridge with of black powder. This gave it significantly lower muzzle velocity and energy than other repeaters of the era, such as the Spencer. The lever action, on the down-stroke, ejected the spent cartridge from the chamber and cocked the hammer. A spring in the magazine forced the next round into the follower; locking the lever back into position pushed the new cartridge into the chamber and closed the breech. As designed, the Henry lacked any form of safety. When not in use its hammer rested on the cartridge rim; any impact on the back of the exposed hammer could cause a chambered round to fire. If left cocked, it was in the firing position without a safety. Modern Henry replicas incorporate a safety mechanism, such as a transfer bar safety, so the gun will not fire if dropped or the hammer is released partially by accident. \n\nTo load the magazine, the shooter moves the cartridge-follower along the slot into the top portion of the magazine-tube and pivots it to the right to open the front-end of the magazine. He loads up to 15 cartridges one by one, he pivots the top portion back and releases the follower.\n\nWhile never issued on a large scale, the Henry rifle demonstrated its advantages of rapid fire at close range several times in the Civil War and later during the wars between the United States and the Plains Indians. Examples include the successes of two Henry-armed Union regiments at the Battle of Franklin against large Confederate attacks, as well as the Henry-armed Sioux and Cheyenne's destruction of the 7th Cavalry at Little Big Horn.\n\nManufactured by the New Haven Arms Company, the Henry rifle evolved into the famous Winchester Model 1866 lever-action rifle. With the introduction of the new Model 1866, the New Haven Arms Company was renamed the Winchester Repeating Arms Company.\n\nThe unrelated Henry Repeating Arms produces a replica of the Model 1860 Henry Rifle with brass receiver and American walnut stock, but a modern steel barrel and internal components.\n\nUberti produces an almost exact copy Henry Model 1860 chambered in .44-40 Winchester or .45 Colt, rather than the original .44 Henry rimfire. Distributed by several companies, these replicas are popular among Cowboy Action Shooters and Civil War reenactors, as well as competition shooters in the North-South Skirmish Association(N-SSA).\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

The Kancil is a rebadged third generation Daihatsu Mira.\n\nThe Kancil was Perodua's first car after its founding in 1992. It is a small five-door hatchback vehicle on a monocoque framework that can seat five people. The Kancil, like its predecessors, is a slightly modified Daihatsu Mira L200; rebadging is common in Malaysia's automotive industry, having begun in 1985 with first car manufacturer Proton, which based its cars on retired models of Mitsubishi Motors. Subsequent Kancils were only rejuvenated cosmetically as Perodua maintained the monocoque structure and tweaked its engines.\n\nThe Kancil is named after the mouse deer, a native animal was commonly found in Malaysian jungle. The car was available with two engines, a 660 cc version with and an 850 with . Four- or five-speed manual transmissions were available (four-speed was not available in the 850) or a three-speed automatic.\n\nThe Kancil was unveiled on the 29th of August 1994. At launch two variants were on offered: EX and GX both powered by a 660 cc engine and both paired to a manual transmission. 4-speed manual for the EX and 5-speed manual for the GX. \n\nIn January 1995, the Perodua Kancil EZ was launched. It came with an automatic transmission and in addition to the existing equipment on the GX variant, there was colored bumpers, gear lock, side protector molding, hazard sign and the first-aid kit for metallic and mica models only. It was launched at RM28,931.14 for the solid colors (Kristal White and Bunga Raya Red), RM 29,838.14 for the Metallic version (Kilauan Silver) and RM 30,214.00 for the Mica version (Blue Mica) in Peninsular Malaysia.\n\nIn August 1996, the Perodua Kancil 850cc version was launched. It came with both GX (manual transmission) and EZ (automatic transmission) variants in addition to the existing 660cc version. Their features and colours are carried over from both GX and EZ of 660cc version, with additional of front power windows, and with Violet Purple colour instead of Blue Mica and Classic Blue. Their prices were quite little higher than 660cc versions because of the bigger 850cc engine volume and power, as well as the latter additional equipment. Besides both variants, the additional 850cc GX based Kancil Era variant was also introduced.\n\nOn 27 August 1997, the Perodua Kancil was facelifted. Changes included new design for the larger front grille, rear garnish, rounded indicator lights, clear rear signal lenses (amber in pre-facelift) and different wheel caps designs, new cabin upholstery with the use of improved seat fabric and 2 front washer nozzles. The Kancil 850 cc series, got new white faced metres and adjustable head rest. Prices were between RM 24,833.74 to RM 33,465.84. \n\nOn 3 May 1998, the Perodua Kancil EX extra was launched. It came with a 660cc engine and 5-speed manual transmission.\n\nIn 2000, the car was given another slight facelift consisting of body-coloured side mouldings, a new grille and reprofiled front bumper with larger indicators, and electrical adjustable side mirrors were equipped for 850cc models.This facelift was available with three variants: 660 EX, 850 EX and 850 EZ.\n\nThe Kancil received a more extensive restyling in September 2002, featuring rounder headlights, taillights and bumpers; its rear license plate was also repositioned onto its hatch from the bumper below. Its interior features a flushed dashboard with the combination instrumentation panel placed in the middle similar to that of the Toyota Yaris. However, it is still mechanically identical to its predecessor, except for the EZi automatic transmission variant which was given a fuel-injected powerplant though this variant wasn't available at launch. Perodua cited Daihatsu’s thorough testing procedures and the engine being made locally with many local component for the EZi variant to be only introduced later on. At launch only manual transmission equipped variants were available: 660EX and 850EX. \n\nIn February 2003, the Perodua Kancil EZi was launched. It came with an automatic transmission and an electronic fuel injected engine.\n\nBetween June and August 2004, a 660 EXb variant or 660 EX Basic variant was made available as the new base model. Notable omissions from the 660 EX variant included the passenger visor, a clock, door visors, rear wiper, a radio with speakers and an alarm with central locking. Solid Ivory White was the only colour option for this variant.\n\nBetween May and December 2005, a 850 EXS variant was made available. This variant stood for special edition and was priced not much different to the 850 EX variant which it shared the same powertrain (engine and transmission combination) with. Key features of this variant included 12\" alloy wheels like on the 850 EZi variant, a CD player. skirting/bodykit, blue graphics for the instrument cluster, silver painted centre cluster and a leather wrapped steering wheel. Metallic Ebony Black and Metallic Glittering Silver were the only two colour options for this variant. It is interesting to note that other variants either had no radio or a radio with cassette making this variant the only Kancil variant to come with a CD player.\n\nFrom July 2005 a tuned Kancil SE version was also available.\n\nBetween February and March 2008, both the 850 EXS and 850 EZi model was dropped.\n\nProduction of Kancil ceased on 20 July 2009 and replaced by the basic model of Perodua Viva known as Perodua Viva 660BX which comes in manual transmission only.\n\nThe Kancil was sold with various engines and transmissions:\n\nFollowing its release in 1994, the Kancil became an instant success in Malaysia. The Kancil is popular with beginner drivers and is commonly used in Malaysian driving schools. It was also preferable for its fuel efficiency and ease of parking due to its size. In December 1995, Perodua produced its 50,000th Kancil. By January 1997, 100,000 Kancils had been manufactured, and by 1999 250,000 had been built. Average monthly production during its fifteen years was 4,000, with October 2002 being the most successful month with 7,700 built. In total 722,223 Kancils were built, of which around 14,000 were exported.\n\nThe Kancil was exported to a total of 19 different countries. This includes Brunei and Mauritius starting from 1996 and Sri Lanka from 1997.\n\nThe Perodua Kancil was sold in the United Kingdom as the Perodua Nippa in September 1997. It was priced at just over £5,000 (cut to £4,999 in 1999) it was the cheapest new car on sale there until it was replaced by the Perodua Kelisa four years later. The Nippa was exclusively sold with 850cc fuel injected engines, engine code unknown.\n\nIn Indonesia, the Perodua Kancil was sold as the Daihatsu Ceria. The Ceria, meaning \"happy\" or \"cheerful\" in Malay/Indonesian, was introduced at the 11th Gaikindo Auto Expo in Jakarta in July 2001. It had been preceded the year before by the Daihatsu KX-P \"concept car\" - a standard Kancil equipped with a leather and wood interior. The Ceria was only available with the larger 850 cc engine with a carburettor and , in two equipment levels: the base model KL and the more extra-spec KX, which received a chromed grille. It was discontinued in 2006. It was later superseded in 2012 by a spiritual successor, the Ayla.\n\n"}

Hernandez (September 13, 1903 – March 24, 1970), was a Filipino writer and labor leader who was known for his criticism of social injustices in the Philippines and was later imprisoned for his involvement in the communist movement. He was the central figure in a landmark legal case that took 13 years to settle.\n\nHe was born in Tondo, Manila, to parents from Hagonoy, Bulacan. He grew up and studied at the Gagalangin, Tondo, the Manila High School and at the American Correspondence School.\n\nWhile still a teenager, he began writing in Tagalog for the newspaper \"Watawat\" (Flag). He would later write a column for the Tagalog publication \"Pagkakaisa\" (Unity) and become editor of \"Mabuhay\" (Long Live).\n\nHis writings gained the attention of Tagalog literati and some of his stories and poems were included in anthologies, such as Clodualdo del Mundo's \"Parolang Ginto\" and Alejandro Abadilla's \"Talaang Bughaw\".\n\nIn 1922, at the age of 19, Hernandez became a member of the literary society \"Aklatang Bayan\" which included noted Tagalog writers Lope K. Santos and Jose Corazon de Jesus.\n\nIn 1932, he married the Filipino actress Atang de la Rama. Both of them would later be recognized as National Artists: Hernandez for Literature, de la Rama for Theater, Dance and Music.\n\nHis socio-political novels were based on his experiences as a guerrilla, as a labour leader and as a political detainee.\n\n\n\n\n\nHernandez joined the resistance movement when the Japanese invaded in the Philippines in 1941. He was an intelligence operative of the guerilla outfit of Marking and Anderson, whose operations covered Bulacan and the Sierra Madre mountains, throughout the Second World War.\n\nWhile he was a guerilla, Hernandez came in contact with guerillas of the \"Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon\" (Hukbalahap) which was founded by Luis Taruc and other communist ideologues continued by the Philippine Commonwealth troops entered in Bulacan. It is believed that this was when Hernandez developed sympathies, if not belief, with the communist movement.\n\nAfter the war, President Sergio Osmeña appointed him councilor of Manila during the reconstruction of the war-devastated city. He also became president of the defunct Philippine Newspaper Guild in coordination with its editor in chief, Narjeey Larasa.\n\nBut his most significant activities after the war involved organizing labor unions across the country through the labor federation Congress of Labor Organizations (CLO). Influenced by the philosophy of Marx he advocated revolution as a means of change. On May 5, 1947, he led the biggest labor strike to hit Manila at that time. The following year, he became president of the CLO and led another massive labor demonstration on May 1, 1948. \n\nIn 1950, the Philippine military started a crackdown against the communist movement, which was had sparked open rebellion in some areas on Luzon island, and the CLO headquarters was raided on January 20, 1951. Hernandez was arrested on January 26 on the suspicion that he was among the leaders of the rebellion.\n\nThough the authorities could not find evidence to charge him; For six months, he was transferred from one military camp to another and it took nearly a year before he was indicted on a charge of rebellion with murder, arson and robbery - a complex crime unheard of in Philippine legal history.\n\nThe case stirred the interest of civil rights activists in the Philippines and Hernandez was assisted at various times by legal luminaries like Senator Claro M. Recto, former President José P. Laurel and Claudio Teehankee, who would later become Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines. But he remained in prison while his appeal was pending.\n\nIt was while he was imprisoned that he wrote his most notable works. He wrote \"Isang Dipang Langit\" (A Stretch of Heaven), which later won a Republic Cultural Heritage Award, and \"Bayang Malaya\" (Free Nation), which later won a Balagtas Award. Also written in prison was his masterpiece \"Luha ng Buwaya\" (Tears of the Crocodile). Portions of his novel \"Mga Ibong Mandaragit\" (Birds of Prey) was also written while he was at the New Bilibid Prison. He also edited the prison's newspaper \"Muntinglupa Courier\".\n\nAfter five years of imprisonment, the Supreme Court allowed Hernandez to post bail on June 20, 1956. He then resumed his journalistic career and wrote a column for the Tagalog tabloid \"Taliba\". He would later be conferred awards in prestigious literary contests, like the Commonwealth Literary Contest (twice), Don Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards (four times) and journalism awards given by the National Press Club of the Philippines (four times).\n\nOn May 30, 1964, the Supreme Court acquitted Hernandez in a decision that would be a landmark in Philippine jurisprudence. The case \"People of the Philippines vs. Amado V. Hernandez\" is now a standard case study in Philippine law schools.\n\nHernandez continued to write and teach after his acquittal. He was teaching at the University of the Philippines when he died on March 24, 1970. The University of the Philippines posthumously conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Humanities \"honoris causa\". The Ateneo de Manila University awarded him its first \"Tanglaw ng Lahi\" award. He was posthumously honored as National Artist for Literature in 1973. Together with poet José García Villa, Hernández was the first to receive the title in literature.\n\n"}
{"id": "2316561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316561", "title": "Cyclocomputer", "text": "Cyclocomputer\n\nA cyclocomputer, cycle computer, cycling computer or \"cyclometer\" is a device mounted on a bicycle that calculates and displays trip information, similar to the instruments in the dashboard of a car. The computer with display, or \"head unit\", usually is attached to the handlebar for easy viewing. Some GPS watches can also be used as display.\n\nIn 1895, Curtis H. Veeder invented the \"Cyclometer\". The Cyclometer was a simple mechanical device that counted the number of rotations of a bicycle wheel. A cable transmitted the number of rotations of the wheel to an analog odometer visible to the rider, which converted the wheel rotations into the number of miles traveled according to a predetermined formula. After founding the Veeder Manufacturing Company, Veeder promoted the Cyclometer with the slogan, \"It's Nice to Know How Far You Go\". The \"Cyclometer\"'s success led to many other competing types of mechanical computing devices. Eventually, cyclometers were developed that could measure speed as well as distance traveled.\n\nA basic cyclocomputer may display the current speed, average speed, maximum speed, trip distance, trip time, total distance traveled, and the current time. More advanced models also may display altitude, incline (inclinometer), heart rate, power output (measured in watt) and temperature as well as offer additional functions such as pedaling cadence, a stopwatch and even GPS navigation. They have become useful accessories in bicycling as a sport and as a recreational activity.\n\nThe display is usually implemented with a liquid crystal display, and it may show one or more values at once. Many current models display one value, such as current speed, with large numbers, and another number that the user may select, such as time, distance, average speed, etc., with small numbers.\n\nThe head usually has one or more buttons that the user can push to switch the value(s) displayed, reset values such as time and trip distance, calibrate the unit, and on some units, turn on a back light for the display.\n\nThe older, traditional sensors have a magnet attached to a spoke of either the front or rear wheel. A sensor based either on the Hall effect, or on a magnetic reed switch, is attached to the fork or the rear of the frame. The sensor detects when the magnet passes once per rotation of the wheel. Alternatively, a sensor may be attached to the wheel hub. Distance is determined by counting the number of rotations, which translates into the number of wheel circumferences passed. Speed is calculated from distance against lapsed time period.\n\nTo measure cadence (revolutions per minute of the crankarm), a magnet is mounted to the crankarm, and a sensor mounted to the frame. This works on the same principle as the speedometer function.\n\nSome models use a wired connection between the sensor and the head unit. Other cyclocomputers, e.g. those used by competitive cyclists, transmit the data wirelessly from the sensor/transmitter to the head unit.\n\nOnce a new computer is installed, it usually requires proper configuration. This normally includes selecting distance units (kilometers vs. miles) and the circumference of the wheel. Since the sensor measures wheel rotation, different wheel sizes will translate to different measures of speed and distance for a given number of rotations.\n\nFor more accuracy the bicycle (with the set cyclocomputer) must be ridden by the intended rider over an accurately measured distance. The computer's reading is then compared with the known distance and any necessary corrections made.\n\nBesides variables calculated from the rotating wheels or crank, cyclocomputers can display other information.\n\nFor integrated shifters on racing bicycles, the gear can be read by the computer: Shimano's Flight Deck and Campagnolo's ErgoBrain work with their respective systems to detect the gearing. This allows indirect measurement of cadence. These systems do not have sensors on the crankset or cassette to determine what gear the bicycle is in. They work exclusively with the shifters, which may result in misleading information. Instead of knowing what gear the bicycle is in, they rely on sensing when the cyclist changes gears using sensors in the shifters. If the gear change doesn't actually happen, or the computer's sensors are too sensitive (e.g.: when braking with STI-style shifters), the information displayed is not accurate.\n\nWith additional sensors, other performance measurements are available:\n\nSome models also have sensors built into the head that measure and display environmental parameters such as temperature and altitude.\n\nSome more sophisticated models are able to measure the rider's power in terms of watts.

{"id": "2316562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316562", "title": "Summer Camp Nightmare", "text": "Summer Camp Nightmare\n\nSummer Camp Nightmare is an American 1987 horror film directed by Bert L. Dragin and starring Chuck Connors and Charlie Stratton. The film is based on the novel \"The Butterfly Revolution\" by William Butler.\n\nDonald Poultry is a young, intelligent but somewhat socially stunted middle school boy attending Camp North Pines for the summer along with other middle and high school kids. Riding the bus to the camp, he talks into his tape recorder diary, voicing his concerns. All goes well upon arrival; the kids unpack and are given time to play outside before the introductory camp dinner. Donald is caught by a counselor-in-training and bully, Stanley Runk, whose friends call him Runk The Punk. Runk tells Donald it's time for cabin cleaning, but becomes interested in Donald's tape recorder. Donald fools him into thinking it's a computer that analyzes him in an insulting way, and Donald strikes up an immediate enmity with Runk, only to be saved by another CIT, Chris Wade, who dismisses Runk.\n\nAt the dinner shortly afterwards, everyone says hello to the returning counselors Ed Heinz and Jack Caldwell, and Ed leads them in a welcoming applause for the new camp director Mr. Warren. Some of the boys recognize him as an old principal from their school and grumble about how strict his ruling of the camp will probably be. Mr. Warren is a middle-aged man with a generally pleasant demeanor, but he is overbearing when it comes to authority, striving to keep things \"appropriate\" for everyone. He is quite restrained, having limited the rec hall television to only receiving broadcasts from a religious channel, and warning everyone away from a dangerous rope bridge that leads to South Pines, the girls' side of the camp.\n\nMr. Warren invites some of the younger group to a butterfly hunt, revealing that collecting and studying butterflies is his hobby and specialty. Some of the older boys jeer at him behind his back, calling him \"fruity\", except for Franklin Reilly, the CIT of the younger group, who seems respecting of his presence and protective of the young children like Chris.\n\nSome of the older boys sneak off to the bridge after the dinner is over, and Franklin climbs the open-rope loop from start to finish, but they are all caught and reprimanded by Ed. Ed reminds them that summer camp is a place to have fun, not charge headfirst into danger. They all head back to the main camp in time for the evening swim. Chris tries teaching Donald how to swim, but is interrupted and distracted by a visiting female doctor who introduces herself, much to the approval of the campers. Continuing on his own, Donald accidentally floats out too far and begins to drown, but the counselors don't notice. Frank looks up from his reading to see Donald in trouble. Surprised, he glances around to see that nobody else is responding, and jumps in to save Donald himself. When the counselors hear the frantic splashing, they reach the boys as they come out of the water. When Jack asks Franklin what happened, Franklin responds angrily that he's just doing their job for them.\n\nLater, Franklin finds a shy boy named Peter in the cabin on his own, and when he asks if Peter's okay, the kid responds that he became scared when Mr. Warren kept lifting him up too high to see some of the butterflies on the hunt. When Runk enters after Franklin, Franklin misleads Runk, implying that Mr. Warren did something inappropriate to Peter, causing Runk to become furious. Franklin convinces Runk to let him take care of the problem on his own.\n\nLater, when the boys are bored in the rec hall, Donald and Chris climb up to the roof together to fix the rigging on the satellite dish and unlock the disabled channels. Mr. Warren comes in to see the boys all cheering over a music video featuring half-naked women, and he furiously locks down the rec hall. The next night, during a co-ed talent show in which the girls from South Pines visit, he further angers the boys by ending the event early in response to an inappropriate song contributed by Runk and John Mason, and as punishment, he also cancels the upcoming co-ed dance.\n\nSome of the boys meet that night, including all of the CITs with the exception of Chris, who has been sent to the \"meditation center\" as punishment for making out with one of the girls after the show. Franklin leads the group in a discussion about how Mr. Warren is ruining their summer, and he proposes staging a coup and shutting away the authority to take control of the camp themselves. When some of the boys appear apprehensive, Franklin assures them it'll be like a game, not serious, and Donald helps by relating the \"game\" to capture the flag. Franklin, impressed with Donald, appoints him the position of captain in the upcoming revolution. Stunned, but easily won over, Donald accepts. Afterwards, the other boys are more easily sold.\n\nThe next morning, Franklin gets up early and steals a gun the counselors keep locked away for protection. The day begins as an event called Camper-Counselor Turnabout, where the campers and counselors trade places. Everyone is having fun that morning, even counselor Jack, who usually finds it difficult to get along with some of the younger group due to his heavy-duty fitness regimens. At breakfast, camper Shawn poses as Mr. Warren and with his fake authority, he lists several joking changes to the rules that everyone agrees with enthusiastically. However, he is interrupted by a suggestion from Franklin to free Chris from the meditation center, and the suggestion becomes a demanding chant from more than half of the mess hall, startling the counselors.\n\nFranklin and his group quickly run out the back door, pursued by the counselors, who chase them to the meditation center. Though Mr. Warren appears to have the upper hand initially, when he tries to lock Franklin in the building, Franklin takes control by revealing the gun he stole. The other boys help him get the counselors into the meditation center, changing its name to the \"pen\", and they pull a bewildered Chris out. Chris tries to convince Franklin not to go any farther, but Franklin replies that he's simply made a citizen's arrest. He further states that the \"game\" will only last for twenty-four hours. Paul and Runk stay behind to board up the pen while the other boys run off to begin the revolution. While Franklin and Runk visit the girls' camp to capture the female counselors and take over there as well, the rest of the group take over the main office and disable the phone lines. Donald helps Franklin wire the office's intercom into South Pines, and Franklin announces to the girls what has happened.\n\nAll the boys and girls gather in front of the rec hall of North Pines, and Franklin explains to everyone that it's time for the campers to have a say in how the camp is run. He appoints some of the boys and girls to ranks and positions, giving them control over certain aspects of the new combined camp. He leads everyone in an oath to the revolution, where the campers all swear not to betray the leaders.\n\nThat night, a party breaks out in the rec hall, including even the little kids, some of which drink the spiked punch. Chris and his new girlfriend Heather become shocked at how out of control things are, and they carry off the younger kids and put them to bed. Things get worse when John and Runk drag Mr. Warren out of the pen and into the party to see how he will react to it. Everyone laughs to see him with his mouth taped and his hands tied behind his back. He becomes uncomfortable when one of the drunk girls begins dancing sexily in front of him, but Chris runs back in and stops them. He takes the tape off Mr. Warren and tries to free him, but the other boys take charge again and Franklin pulls Chris outside to have a talk.\n\nRunk leads Mr. Warren back toward the pen, but Mr. Warren becomes fierce and tries to struggle away. He shows surprising physical strength, twisting away from Runk multiple times and bashing him furiously even with his hands tied. Runk pulls out a knife and threatens Mr. Warren, but Mr. Warren charges Runk and runs right into the knife. Runk becomes shocked as Mr. Warren falls dead to the ground. He runs back over to the main office where Franklin is sitting, and blubbering, he tells Franklin what happened. Franklin almost loses control at the news, but then he pulls himself together and orders Runk to take Mr. Warren out to the caves far behind the camp and leave him in there. He warns Runk to keep the incident a secret and do exactly as he says from now on.\n\nThe next morning, Franklin announces to the camp that the revolution will continue, and he emphasizes that campers who show courage and dedication to the revolution will be named officers. He also promotes Donald to Minister of Propaganda and appoints him to the Supreme Revolutionary Committee. He goes on to name Chris Wayne and Heather Long as traitors, and orders everyone to shun them. He warns that anyone seen associating with them will also be named traitors. When Chris and Heather venture out into the main cap that morning, they are stunned to see everyone running away from them. When Donald nervously refuses interaction with them, Chris realizes the situation is worse than he thought, and he and Heather run off. A girl named Laurie then asks Donald out to the re-opened dance that will be held that night, and he accepts, but tells her he doesn't know how to dance. She offers to teach him, and they happily feed the camp animals together.\n\nThat night before the dance, some of the campers start a bonfire with Mr. Warren's wooden butterfly collection post outside the rec hall. People laugh at it on their way in. Laurie stands with some of her friends, telling them enthusiastically about Donald, and the girls gush when he arrives to dance with her. John leaves the dance with Debbie to go on a walk with her, but he becomes grabby and she tries to leave him. He angrily pushes her to the ground and sexually assaults her, drawing the attention of Donald and Laurie, who are also out walking, and they run to help. They report John to Franklin, and Franklin holds a meeting the next morning with the members of the Supreme Revolutionary Committee, John's friends, and Debbie's. Donald and Laurie attend as well to support her. Treating the matter like a judge in a court case, Franklin demands John tell him the truth, and John claims Debbie went along with the whole thing and is just a dirty little tease. Franklin asks Debbie what she thinks John's punishment should be, and she claims she wants him dead. The meeting erupts into a confused discussion, but Franklin controls everyone and says he will consider this while John sits out in the pen.\n\nLater, Franklin decides to force John to traverse the rope bridge in a \"trial by ordeal\" arrangement, mimicking older societies who punished criminals by making them perform dangerous tasks that could kill them. When John successfully loops the whole bridge, the girls become angry at him. They wait for the other guys to leave, and then they carry him off and hang him from a tree.\n\nDonald finds John's body and becomes very upset, deciding things have gone far enough. He jerry rigs the disabled phone lines into the satellite over the main office, using a stolen receiver as a radio. He tries to call through to someone, but only hears static, and he is captured by officer Blackridge and locked inside the office. Chris visits him and they talk about how the camp has gone nuts, but Blackridge finds Chris in there and throws him out. The next morning, the camp becomes shocked to learn that Donald will be forced to loop the bridge as well, and some of them begin to realize how dangerous Franklin is. They begin to rally support amongst themselves as the crowd gathers by the bridge in time for Donald's punishment. At first it looks like he might make it, but then Franklin orders Runk to cut one of the ropes on the bridge. The campers realize Franklin wants Donald dead, and they all snap and turn against the Supreme Revolutionary Committee, fighting them off to save Donald.\n\nThe police arrive suddenly, breaking up the fight, revealing they received Donald's broadcast the previous night. They take Donald's tape recorded diary for evidence, and Donald and Chris are dismissed as unwilling participants. Heather and Laurie wait together by the bus for home, and are both relieved to see Chris and Donald arrive. They all board together, and the bus roars off, leaving the camp deserted.\n\n\nThe film was given a limited release theatrically in the United States by Concorde Pictures through April and May 1987.\n\nThe film was released on VHS and LaserDisc the same year by Embassy Home Entertainment. As of 2011, the film has still not been officially released on DVD.\n\n"}

It is the first in a trilogy featuring Ralph S. Mouse, a house mouse who can speak to humans (though typically only children), goes on adventures riding his miniature motorcycle, and who longs for excitement and independence while living with his family in a run-down hotel. \n\nThe story and characters were inspired both by Cleary's son, who while recovering from a fever played with miniature cars and motorcycles, and by a neighbor who had shown Cleary a small mouse that had been trapped in a bucket.\n\nThe book was released as a selection of the Weekly Reader Children's Book Club (Intermediate Division) and won the \"William Allen White Childrens Book Award\" in 1968. Cleary went on to write two more books featuring the Ralph S. Mouse character in the following decade, and a film adaptation of \"The Mouse and The Motorcycle\" was produced in 1986.\n\nRalph is a mouse who lives in the run-down Mountain View Inn, a battered resort hotel in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California. Ralph longs for a life of danger and speed, wishing to get away from his relatives, who worry about the mice colony being discovered. One day a boy named Keith Gridley and his family visit the hotel on their way through California. Keith leaves a toy motorcycle on his bedside table. While Keith is away, Ralph attempts to ride it, but cannot figure out how to start it. Startled by a telephone ring, both Ralph and the motorcycle fall into a metal wastebasket.\n\nKeith discovers his missing motorcycle in the wastebasket. Although Ralph's mother worries that he is in contact with humans, Keith shows Ralph how to start the motorcycle—make an engine-like noise—and lets Ralph ride it at night. While Keith and his family explore California, Ralph recklessly rides the motorcycle through the depths of the hotel. One night he is spotted by Keith's mother, who initially thinks she is imagining things, but later is sure that she saw a mouse riding a motorcycle. Ralph and the motorcycle are almost sucked up by a maid's vacuum cleaner, but Ralph escapes, riding into a pile of linen and dirty bedsheets. He escapes by chewing holes in the sheets, forced to leave the precious vehicle behind.\n\nAfter Ralph loses the motorcycle, Keith loses trust in him. He still brings the mice colony food. One night Keith becomes very sick, because his parents don't have any more aspirin and are unable to obtain one until morning. To regain Keith's trust, Ralph searches the hotel for an aspirin tablet, at risk to himself, for the medicine could prove fatal to a small mouse if ingested (in fact, Ralph's father was taken down with a bad cold and died in spite of all they could do). Ralph is able to find an aspirin tablet and borrows Keith's toy ambulance to retrieve it. When Ralph is successful, Keith's health is restored. In gratitude, Keith gives Ralph the motorcycle to keep—one of the hotel's housekeepers had found it among the linens from which Ralph escaped. Ralph uses the space under the TV set in the lobby as a garage; the motorcycle is his to keep.\n\n\nChurchill Films produced an adaptation of \"The Mouse and the Motorcycle\" directed by Ron Underwood in 1986, featuring Mimi Kennedy and Ray Walston. \n\nThe film was distributed by Strand VCI Entertainment and Golden Book Video under the \"GoldenVision\" label.\n"}

{"id": "2316586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316586", "title": "Wavelength (album)", "text": "Wavelength (album)\n\nWavelength is the tenth studio album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison, and was released in the autumn of 1978. The album has a different musical sound from his previous albums, leaning towards a pop rock sound with prominent electric guitars and synthesizers. \"Wavelength\" was Morrison's best selling album at the time of the original release. Mick Glossop, Bobby Tench and Peter Bardens were given credit for special assistance in production.\n\nA remastered version of the album was released on 29 January 2008. It contains two bonus tracks, \"Wavelength\" and \"Kingdom Hall\", taken from the promotional album \"Van Morrison Live at the Roxy\" (1979), recorded on 26 November 1978.\n\n\"Wavelength\" was recorded over several months at the Manor in Oxfordshire, England, and completed later at Shangri-la studios in the United States. Morrison had brought together musicians that represented almost all phases of his musical history to date: Herbie Armstrong from his showband days in Belfast, Peter Bardens from Them, Garth Hudson from the Band and Peter Van Hooke who had worked with Morrison a few years earlier. He also added guitarist Bobby Tench from Streetwalkers.\n\nThe songs on this album recall various stages of Morrison's life. \"Kingdom Hall\" harked back to his childhood in Belfast when he attended services with his mother, who at one time was a practicing Jehovah's Witness. \"Checking It Out\" is about a relationship going wrong and being rescued by \"guides and spirits along the way\". \"Natalia\", \"Venice USA\" and \"Lifetimes\" are love songs. \"Wavelength\" recalled fond memories of his adolescence listening to the Voice of America. The next track incorporates two songs Morrison had written in the early 1970s: \"Santa Fe\" written with Jackie DeShannon in 1973, Morrison's first ever collaboration to appear on an album, and \"Beautiful Obsession\", which was first played during one of his concerts in 1971. However, a studio version of the song is not known to have been recorded during that period. \"Hungry For Your Love\" appeared in the hit movie \"An Officer and a Gentleman\" (1982); on it, Morrison plays electric piano accompanied by Herbie Armstrong's acoustic guitar. It has become, along with \"Wavelength\", one of the more enduringly popular songs on the album. Morrison included \"Hungry For Your Love\" on his compilation album \"Van Morrison at the Movies – Soundtrack Hits\" (2007).\n\n\"Take it Where You Find It\" ends the album and, according to Scott Floman, is a \"quietly epic love letter to America that gets better and better as it goes along (the song is nearly 9 minutes long). Simply put this song, which I'd rank among Van's all-time best, makes me want to lock arms with someone, anyone, and commence in a slowly swaying sing along...\"\n\nIn a contemporary review for \"Rolling Stone\", Lester Bangs gave a lukewarm assessment and called \"Wavelength\" \"a very nice record. I'm sure all the people at Warner Bros. are pleased with it. Ditto the DJs... Still, though, it do confound how such a monumental talent can mire himself in such twaddle, fine as some of it may be.\" \"Melody Maker\" reviewed the album as evidence of Morrison's \"drift into the American Dream.\" In \"The Village Voice\", Robert Christgau referred to it as a good but not great album and called attention to side two, which he felt was \"an evocative reinterpretation of Van's America fixation, but side one is nothing more (and nothing less) than class programming.\" \"Time\" magazine was more enthusiastic: \"Morrison has made two, maybe three albums that rank high among the finest of all rock 'n' roll. \"Wavelength\" is good enough to stand close by Morrison's best work, a record of sinuous, sensuous magic. The man just can't be beat.\" \nIn a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said \"\"Wavelength\" essentially picks up where \"A Period of Transition\" left off, offering a focused, full-bodied alternative to that record's warmly fuzzy lack of direction.\" Rob Sheffield wrote in \"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\" (2004) that the record was a \"failed pop move\" redeemed by its \"worthy hit\" title track, \"which like many of his best songs expresses the profound spiritual yearning to listen to the radio\".\n\nMorrison denied that the songs were anything but about personal experience, and were not about the United States. It quickly became the fastest-selling album that Morrison had recorded at that time, and went gold within three months. He relocated to Europe within a few years; his work during the 1980s would not be so \"radio friendly\" and easily accessible to the casual listener. With the success of \"Wavelength\", Morrison assembled a band to promote it, similar in many ways to the abandoned Caledonia Soul Orchestra of \"It's Too Late to Stop Now\" fame. During the \"Wavelength\" tour, Morrison performed in his native Belfast for the first time since leaving for the US to record \"Brown Eyed Girl\" for Bang Records. Morrison's first video, \"Van Morrison in Ireland\", released in 1981, resulted from these performances, and featured two songs from the album: \"Wavelength\" and \"Checkin' It Out\".\n\nThe cover on the album was by photographer Norman Seeff (associated with Joni Mitchell's album sleeves), and shows Morrison almost smiling and dressed in tight white trousers smoking a cigarette down to the butt.\n\nAll songs written by Van Morrison except where noted.\n\n\n\nIncludes the same tracks as on the original, with two additional bonus tracks:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Billboard\"\nUK Album Chart\n"}

She has worked extensively in the porn and BDSM communities.\n\nNitke was born in Lynchburg, Virginia in 1950 and grew up in Virginia and Alaska. She is currently a fashion/art photographer, and is on the faculty of the School of Visual Arts in New York.\n\nHailed by The Village Voice for her quest \"to find humanity in marginal sex\", Nitke has gained worldwide attention for her affecting and powerful photographs chronicling relationships between consenting adults engaged in sadomasochistic activities.\n\nHer documentation of sexuality began in 1982 on the sets of pornographic films, towards the end of the Golden Age of Porn. She worked in the industry for twelve years as a set photographer on hundreds of adult films. Her photographs from this period reveal the combination of boredom, surrealism, vulnerability and dissociation inherent in the X-rated world. During that time she also became active as a photographer on mainstream television and movie sets, work which she continues today.\n\nIn 1991, after the hardcore porn business moved to Los Angeles, she began shooting on the New York sets of fetish and SM movies, which had become the fastest growing segment of the adult film industry.\n\nThree years later she attended her first meeting of The Eulenspiegel Society, the oldest SM support and educational group in the country, to see a presentation by underground photographer Charles Gatewood. The couples she met in the SM scene fascinated her, and she began photographing them in 1994. They became the focus of her book, \"Kiss of Fire: A Romantic View of Sadomasochism\" (2003). It was among the first mainstream publications to examine the subject of BDSM.\n\nNitke ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to produce her second book, \"Barbara Nitke: American Ecstasy\" (2012), a memoir in pictures and words of her hardcore porn days.\n\nIn 2001, Nitke filed a lawsuit, along with co-plaintiff the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom, challenging the constitutionality of the Communications Decency Act, a federal statute prohibiting the publication of obscenity on the Internet. The case was called \"Nitke v. Ashcroft\", then later changed to \"Nitke v. Gonzales\".\n\nNitke and the NCSF argued that while the Supreme Court's decision in \"Miller v. California\" defines obscenity according to community standards, the Internet does not permit publishers to restrict the dissemination of their speech based on geography. Therefore, the plaintiffs claimed, a person posting sexually explicit material on the Internet could be found criminally liable according to the standards of the most restrictive community in the country. This, Nitke said, would chill her freedom of speech and therefore violate her First Amendment rights.\n\nA three-judge panel of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York conducted a trial, and in 2005 found that Nitke and the NCSF had presented insufficient evidence that the variation in community standards is substantial enough to chill the plaintiffs' speech. On March 20, 2006, the Supreme Court affirmed that ruling without opinion.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Also known as Lebanon Airport, it is the northernmost commercial airport in New Hampshire, near the Vermont border, off Interstate 89 just south of the junction with Interstate 91. Other nearby towns include Hanover, New Hampshire and White River Junction, Vermont. The area is also the home of Dartmouth College and the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center.\n\nIn recent years, the airport has struggled due to competition with the much larger Manchester-Boston Regional Airport, 65 miles (87 kilometers) away and accessible via the I-89 freeway. Colgan Air formerly offered nonstop flights from Lebanon to New York LaGuardia Airport operating as US Airways Express via a code sharing agreement with US Airways. The airline first operated the flights with the Beechcraft 1900 commuter propjet and later with the Saab 340 regional turboprop before service ended in November 2008.\n\nOn November 2, 2008, Cape Air began offering service to Boston. Airline service is subsidized by the Essential Air Service program utilizing the smaller Cessna 402 twin prop aircraft. The terminal building has typical facilities such as baggage claim, a check-in desk, rental car services, and airport security.\n\nAs per Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 8,294 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 6,089 enplanements in 2009, and 7,832 in 2010. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021, in which it is categorized as a non-hub primary commercial service facility.\n\nLebanon Airport was served by Northeast Airlines before this air carrier was acquired by and merged into Delta Air Lines. In 1948, the airport was a stop on a daily round trip service operated by Northeast with a Douglas DC-3 linking New York City with Montreal. The June 16, 1948 Northeast Airlines system timetable listed the routing of this flight as New York City - Hartford/Springfield - Keene, NH - Lebanon - Monpelier/Barre, VT - Burlington, VT - Montreal. In 1964, Northeast was operating direct one stop service to New York John F. Kennedy Airport with four engine Douglas DC-6B propliners via Keene. By 1969, Northeast was operating up to ten flights a day from the airport with Fairchild Hiller FH-227 turboprop aircraft with nonstop service to New York LaGuardia Airport (LGA), Boston (BOS), Montpelier/Barre (MPV), Manchester, NH (MHT) and Keene, NH (EEN) with daily direct one stop service to Burlington (BTV). Northeast was merged into Delta Air Lines in 1972 which in turn continued to serve the airport.\n\nIn 1973, Delta was operating nonstop as well as direct service from the airport to New York LaGuardia Airport and New York John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK) with Fairchild Hiller FH-227 turboprops with these aircraft having been previously operated by Northeast. At this same time, according to its March 1, 1973 system timetable, Delta had introduced McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jet service at nearby Keene, NH; however, Delta did not operate jet flights into Lebanon.\n\nAccording to the April 15, 1975 edition of the Official Airline Guide (OAG), Delta was no longer serving the airport with all flights at this time being operated by Air New England with Beechcraft 99, de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and Fairchild Hiller FH-227 turboprop aircraft with nonstop service to Boston and Montpelier/Barre, VT as well as direct flights to New York LaGuardia Airport via a stop in Keene, NH. The OAG lists up to fourteen flights a day being operated into the airport by Air New England at this time.\n\nLebanon Municipal Airport covers an area of 563 acres (228 ha) at an elevation of 603 feet (184 m) above mean sea level.

He was played by John Schneider. The name of \"Beauregard\" may have been chosen after the famous Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard.\n\nBo and his cousin Lucas K. \"Luke\" Duke (Tom Wopat) live in an unincorporated area of the fictional Hazzard County, in Georgia. Bo and Luke own a 1969 Dodge Charger, named \"The General Lee\", which is painted orange, with the Confederate flag on top, and \"01\" painted on the sides with the name \"General Lee\" inscribed above the doors that were welded shut for safety. Bo and Luke evade the corrupt officials of Hazzard County, Boss Hogg and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane and usually end up putting an end to Hogg's latest crooked scheme.\n\nThe Dukes (including cousin Daisy Duke and Uncle Jesse Duke) were well known for their role in the moonshine business among other interests. Bo and Luke had both been sentenced to probation for illegal transportation of moonshine. As a result, neither was permitted to use firearms, instead preferring to use bow and arrows, which they sometimes tipped with dynamite. The terms of Bo and Luke's probation included staying within the boundaries of Hazzard County (unless given special permission by their Probation Officer, J.D. Hogg).\n\nBo was the blonde, slightly younger of the two Duke boys, and the more impulsive one of the pair. He often reacted to situations on impulse without thinking, sometimes with an \"act/speak now, think later\" attitude (although his character was seen to mature slightly over the seasons of the series). Although both Duke boys had a knack of landing themselves in trouble, it was more typically Bo's impulsive nature that often got them into various scrapes, and the slightly more mature Luke, the \"thinker\" of the duo, to find a solution. Bo's eye for the ladies and tendency to fall in love easily, also causes him to sometimes be easily led and affect his judgement and leads to trouble for the Dukes on a number of occasions (most prominently in the feature-length/two-part story \"Carnival of Thrills\", produced at the end of the second season and broadcast at the start of the third).\n\nThe character was nearly always seen wearing the same style of clothes, with a yellow shirt (with a blue T-shirt underneath for the first two seasons and some of third; this T-shirt is brown in the pilot episode), and light blue jeans. The exact hue of the shirt varied across the seasons - early on it was a deeper yellow; mid-run it was more of a cream color, and late examples saw it being more of a grey tone. The second episode produced and broadcast, \"Daisy's Song\", is notable for Bo instead wearing a red shirt for much of the story. A sequence in the fifth episode, \"High Octane\", sees Bo dressed in a light blue shirt, and many early publicity shots see the character dressed in a darker blue denim shirt.\n\nThe character of Bo was best known for his rebel yell exclamation of the catchphrase, \"\"Yee-Haa!\"\"; cousin Luke sometimes also performed such a yell, but on a less regular basis. (Actor Tom Wopat had trouble mastering the high-pitched yell early on, and in the opening credits and many examples within the episodes, it is actually a recording of John Schneider's version used twice to represent both Duke boys' yell).\n\nMost of the time, it was Bo who drove \"The General Lee\", with his cousin Luke riding shotgun (although these roles were swapped more regularly in later seasons); very early episodes suggested that the \"General\" belonged solely to Bo (Luke is said to have had a car that was wrecked very shortly before the start of the first episode, \"One Armed Bandits\"), but by mid-first season, it was more implied that both Bo and Luke owned the \"General Lee\" evenly between them.\n\nBo was an ex-stock car driver (though he joined the NASCAR Circuit for most of season 5 with his cousin Luke), and he was typically the one known for taking the \"General\" on most of its legendary jumps. Because its doors were welded shut, Bo and Luke always had to climb in and out of the car through the windows. Actors John Schneider and Tom Wopat have admitted that, on occasions that the roles were reversed and Luke drove, they found it much more difficult to climb in and out of the opposite window to which they were accustomed.\n\nBo later left Hazzard County, along with his cousin Luke, to join the NASCAR circuit (coinciding with Schneider's and Wopat's decision to walk out of the show during the fifth season over a dispute over royalties owed to them), although how they managed to do this with the probation conditions in place was never revealed; Bo's cousin Coy (Byron Cherry), who was very similar in both appearance and nature to Bo, replaced Bo until he returned to the series a few months later.\n\nAccording to the 1997 film \"\", Bo left Hazzard again to pursue a successful NASCAR career, this time without Luke. Shortly before his return to Hazzard, he crashed his car, and is still in Hazzard in the 2000 film \"\". Although he was a lifelong bachelor, in the 2000 film, he met a woman named Gabrielle (nicknamed Gabby) in Los Angeles and convinced her to go to Hazzard to be with him.\n\n"}

The show spans 30 episodes over two seasons. The original pilot and season 2 premiere are 90 minutes long, while all the other episodes are approximately 45 minutes long. ABC canceled the series due to declining ratings in the second season.\n\nBoth seasons of \"Twin Peaks\" were released on DVD in the U.S. in 2001 for the first season by Republic Pictures Entertainment/Artisan Home Entertainment and 2007 for the second and final season by Paramount Pictures Home Entertainment/CBS DVD, respectively. A complete series DVD box set, titled \"The Definitive Gold Box Edition\", with additional features was released on October 30, 2007. The complete series (including the film) was released on Blu-ray with even further material on July 29, 2014.\n\n\"Twin Peaks\" follows FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper, who is sent to the fictional town of Twin Peaks, Washington to investigate the murder of popular and respected high school student Laura Palmer. A feature-length prequel film, titled \"\", was released on August 28, 1992, which depicts the events leading up to Laura's death.\n\nThe regular cast includes Kyle MacLachlan as FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper, Michael Ontkean as Sheriff Harry S. Truman, Mädchen Amick as Shelly Johnson, Dana Ashbrook as Bobby Briggs, Richard Beymer as Benjamin Horne, Lara Flynn Boyle as Donna Hayward, Sherilyn Fenn as Audrey Horne, Warren Frost as Dr. Will Hayward, Peggy Lipton as Norma Jennings, James Marshall as James Hurley, Everett McGill as Big Ed Hurley, Jack Nance as Pete Martell, Kimmy Robertson as Lucy Moran, Ray Wise as Leland Palmer, Joan Chen as Josie Packard, and Piper Laurie as Catherine Martell.\n\nOn October 6, 2014, it was announced that the series would return for a third season to air on Showtime. It premiered on May 21, 2017, and consists of 18 episodes.\n\n<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>\n\nThe first season of \"Twin Peaks\" began airing during the 1989–90 United States network television schedule on April 8, 1990. It consists of eight episodes. The pilot opens with the discovery of the plastic-wrapped body of popular high school student Laura Palmer, an event which moves residents of the small town of Twin Peaks, Washington. Sheriff Harry S. Truman investigates Palmer's murder in conjunction with Dale Cooper, an eccentric FBI agent. As Cooper settles into his life in Twin Peaks, he meets the town's residents, who each prove bizarre and quirky in their respective ways. As the series progresses, the seemingly normal appearance of the town begins to fade, revealing various secrets that expose Twin Peaks as the disturbed, unsettling town that it is.\n\nBefore the season began, a companion book, \"The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer\", was published. Some but not all of the diary entries mentioned during the season were in the book.\n\nThe second season premiered on September 30, 1990, during the 1990–91 United States network television schedule. It consisted of 22 episodes. Lynch directed the first two, as well as the season's seventh episode (\"Lonely Souls\"), where Laura Palmer's killer is revealed. He also directed the season finale. In February 1991, Robert A. Iger, president of ABC Entertainment, announced plans to put \"Twin Peaks\" on hiatus; By May, Iger said \"it's unlikely that \"Twin Peaks\" will return\".\n\nThe season continues Cooper's investigation of Laura Palmer's murder. He receives some clues from a mysterious \"giant\" that appears to him in a dream. A new murder leads to the discovery of Laura Palmer's killer. Later, Cooper is suspended by the FBI due to his participation in an unauthorized raid on the One Eyed Jacks casino. Cooper's former partner, Windom Earle, escapes from a psychiatric hospital and comes to the town for a confrontation with Cooper. As the town prepares for its \"Miss Twin Peaks\" contest, Cooper tries to uncover the secret of the Black Lodge with help from Sheriff Truman.\n\n\"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me\" is a prequel to the TV series. It tells of the investigation into the murder of Teresa Banks and the last seven days in the life of Laura Palmer. Director David Lynch and most of the television cast returned for the film, with the notable exceptions of Lara Flynn Boyle, who declined to return as Laura's best friend Donna Hayward and was replaced by Moira Kelly, and Sherilyn Fenn due to scheduling conflicts. Also, Kyle MacLachlan returned reluctantly as he wanted to avoid typecasting, so his presence in the film is smaller than originally planned. Lynch originally shot about five hours of footage which was cut down to 134 minutes to allow the film to have a mainstream release. Many of the cut scenes were later released as \"\" in 2014. The film was a box office bomb upon release and was widely panned by critics; however, it has developed a cult following over time and has been critically reevaluated. The release of the third season in 2017, which made many references to the events of the film, led to renewed interest in the film. \n\nThe third season is a limited series set 25 years after the events of the season two finale. All episodes were written by David Lynch and Mark Frost. The series was originally planned to have nine episodes, however, after re-negotiations between Lynch and Showtime, the episode order was doubled, with Lynch confirmed to direct all episodes. The season premiered on May 21, 2017, and consists of 18 episodes identified only by number, with short quotes from each serving as both \"de facto\" titles and short synopses; no additional episode information was released in advance.\nFor the original series, creators David Lynch and Mark Frost assigned no episode titles, only episode numbers. When the series aired in Germany, titles were assigned, which were then translated to English. The episodes are untitled on the DVD sets, but the titled episodes appear on the official \"Twin Peaks\" CBS website and on Netflix when streaming the episodes. Episode 2, known as \"Zen, or the Skill to Catch a Killer\" is also known as \"Zen and the Art of Killer-Catching\". When episodes 29 and 30 aired in Germany, they were aired as a single broadcast, with only episode 30 being assigned a title. Fans then decided to title episode 29 \"Miss Twin Peaks\", which is how the episode is titled both on the CBS website and on Netflix. However, when episode 29 was re-run in 1996, it was assigned an alternative title which translated to \"The Night of the Decision\".\n\n"}

About 66% of the population of Montreal West speak English as their first language.\n\nThe core business area of Montreal West is located on Westminster Avenue between Sherbrooke and Curzon. Until 2010, it consisted exclusively of small, non-franchised businesses, but in a controversial decision, the Pharmaprix drugstore chain was allowed to open a large outlet on the corner of Westminster and Sherbrooke Street.\n\nOn January 1, 2002, as part of the 2002–2006 municipal reorganization in Montreal, Montreal West and the neighbouring suburbs of Côte-Saint-Luc and Hampstead were merged into the City of Montreal and became the borough of Côte-Saint-Luc–Hampstead–Montreal West. Following a change of government and a 2004 referendum in which the population voted to de-merge by a wide margin, Montreal West was reconstituted as an independent city on January 1, 2006.\n\nThe Town of Montreal West is served by its mayor, Beny Masella, and four city councillors.\n\n\nBeny Masella is responsible for Intergovernmental Affairs and Media Relations.\n\nIn terms of services, the town has its own public works division, Public Security Department, a fire station, a community centre (named after former town mayor John A.

The riding is known as Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and its Member of National Assembly is Liberal Kathleen Weil.\n\nMontreal West is notable for having Quebec's highest rated Anglophone public high school, Royal West Academy (ranked 39th overall in 2005 by the Fraser Institute). It also has two Anglophone elementary schools, Elizabeth Ballantyne Elementary School and Edinburgh Elementary School which offers French immersion. These schools are part of the English Montreal School Board.\n\nThe town has a public children's library located in Elizabeth Ballantyne school. A library for all age groups is located on Westminster Avenue.\n\nMontreal West is serviced by six Société de transport de Montréal bus lines. Each of these connects to a corresponding Montreal Metro (subway) station. The Montréal-Ouest Train Station also services the area. Trains that run through this station connect passengers to downtown Montreal on one end, and three different routes heading away from the city at the other end.\n\nBus routes servicing Montreal-West:\nMontreal West includes three medium-sized churches. One is United (Montreal West United Church ), one is Anglican (St. Philip's Church), and the final is Presbyterian (Montreal West Presbyterian Church). The Montreal West United Church also rents space to a Pentecostal service (Overcomers Assembly). St. Philip's Anglican Church rents space to the New Life Korean Presbyterian Church.\n\nCanada Day is the largest community event of the year in Montreal West. Residents organize a parade route that mainly runs down the main street of Westminster and ends at Strathern Park. Floats represented in the parade include organizations and clubs located in town, as well as some created personally by residents.\nIn some years, there have been water fights between sidelined residents and members of the parade (mainly the swimming pool float). Water fights during these years have seen water balloons and super soaker water guns, as well as the odd hose drawn from a house. Organizers have tried to minimize these activities in recent years so as not to detract from the parade itself, with varying success.\n\nFollowing the parade, residents converge on Strathern Park for a giant picnic/BBQ. Many children's games and activities go on at the park, as well as in the nearby Percival park. The final event of the evening is the fireworks, which take place around 10pm at Hodgson Field.\n\nAnnually on June 23 (the day before the actual holiday) there is a picnic at Davies Park, featuring music performed by Québécois musicians. In the late evening, a large bonfire is held in the centre of the park.\n\nThe Garbage Bowl is a yearly tradition held every January 1 since 1950, where men from Montreal West separate into two teams, the Northern Combines in red longjohns and the Southern Bombers in green longjohns, and play a football game in the frigid weather with proceeds from donations, food, and commemorative pins going to charity.\n\nThe town of Montreal West has a large number of neighbourhood parks and public spaces. They include: Dave Reid Park, Davies Park, George Booth Park, Hodgson Park, John A. Simms Park, Kirkpatrick Park, Memorial Park, Percival Park, Ronald Park, Roy D.

{"id": "2316643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316643", "title": "Canada and the Iraq War", "text": "Canada and the Iraq War\n\nThe Iraq War began with the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq. The Government of Canada did not at any time formally declare war against Iraq, and the level and nature of this participation, which changed over time, was controversial. Canada's intelligence services repeatedly assessed that Iraq did not have an active WMD program.\n\nWhile Canada had previously participated in military action against Iraq in the Gulf War of 1991, it refused to declare war against Iraq without United Nations Security Council approval. Even so, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien said on 10 October 2002 that Canada would, in fact, be part of a military coalition to invade Iraq if it were sanctioned by the United Nations. However, when the United States and the United Kingdom subsequently withdrew their diplomatic efforts to gain that UN sanction, Jean Chrétien announced in Parliament on 18 June 2003 that Canada would \"not\" participate in the pending invasion. Nevertheless, he offered the US and its soldiers his moral support. Two days earlier, a quarter million people in Montreal had marched against the pending war. Major anti-war demonstrations had taken place in several other Canadian cities.\n\nCanada's relation to the Iraq War that began in 2003 was unlike Canada's role in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan because it was far less direct. About a hundred Canadian exchange officers, on exchange to American units, participated in the invasion of Iraq. It has been reported that Canadian troops in the region numbered fewer than only three other participating countries. The War also affected Canada in the form of protests and counter-protests related to the conflict, and United States Military members who sought refuge in the country after deserting their posts to avoid deployment to Iraq—but who, unlike as with the Vietnam War, were mostly returned by Canada forthwith to the United States.\n\nThe Prime Minister of Canada at the time, Jean Chrétien, advised Governor General Adrienne Clarkson not to have Canada \"join with the so-called Coalition of the willing\" that was central to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. This position was consistent with that which the Prime Minister had earlier expressed before 19 March 2003 invasion of Iraq; namely, that \"Canada was unlikely to join an invasion without explicit support from the United Nations.\" The decision by the United Nations (UN) on whether or not to sanction the invasion rested on two elements: a discussion of international law, including the Nuremberg Principles on preemptive war; and the UN inspections for Iraq's alleged possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction.\n\nThough the leader of the Canadian Alliance Party, Stephen Harper, objected to the Prime Minister's position on Iraq, stating that Canada should be fighting alongside the US, Chrétien's decision may have reflected the view of the general Canadian public: In March 2003, a poll conducted by EKOS Research Associates for the \"Toronto Star\" and has contrary views to the conservative party Stephen Harper led at the time and the Montreal newspaper \"La Presse\" found 71% of those questioned did not support the United States-led invasion, with 27% expressing disapproval. As well, the Prime Minister's advice to the viceroy was based on feasibility problems for Canada: on 31 March 2003, \"Maclean's\" magazine reported that \"Canada has committed about 2,000 troops to Afghanistan this summer, a significant contribution given the stretched state of the Canadian military.\"\n\nThe weakness of the Canadian military had been a factor in its very limited role in the 1991 Gulf War. While the military had been asked about the feasibility of sending 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (4 CMBG) from Germany to the Gulf to participate in direct combat operations, the Canadian Forces were forced to report that Operation \"Broadsword\", a theoretical deployment, would likely be a failure.\n\nCanada, despite not joining the invading coalition, still participated in the conflict in Iraq, joining a number of non-belligerent nations in helping to rebuild the country post-invasion, including the training of Iraqi police and army officers, and contributing approximately $300 million towards this effort. Also, a group of Canadians, including former Ontario Premier Bob Rae, were sent in the summer of 2005 to help compose the new Iraqi constitution, and Jean-Pierre Kingsley served as head of the international team observing the Iraqi legislative election of January 2005. Due to security concerns, both of these groups were based in Jordan.\n\nThough no declaration of war was issued, the Governor General-in-Council did order the mobilization of a number of Canadian Forces personnel to serve actively in Iraq. On 31 March 2003, it was reported in \"Maclean's\" that in the previous month Canadian officers, aboard three frigates and a destroyer, had been placed in command of the multinational naval group Task Force 151, which patrolled the Persian Gulf region. A further 30 Canadians worked at the US Central Command in Qatar, and 150 troops were on exchange with US and British forces in proximity to combat. North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) stationed Canadian Air Force pilots also flew combat missions with the US Air Force E-3 Sentry, and exchange officers fought with US units. Canadian pilots also flew Boeing C-17s into Iraq to \"season\" the flight crews. In all, 40 to 50 Canadian military members participated in the conflict.\nBecause of this Canadian involvement in Iraq, the Ministers of the Crown at the time were criticised by Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition as hypocritical, and demands were made for the return of these Canadian Forces personnel. The Prime Minister stated that the Canadian military was not involved in direct combat, while still fulfilling its commitment to NORAD. However, it was claimed by Janice Gross Stein and Eugene Lang in \"The Unexpected War\" that people from Canadian ministries were in Washington, D.C., openly vaunting Canada's participation in Iraq; as Stein and Lang put it: \"in an almost schizophrenic way, the government bragged publicly about its decision to stand aside from the war in Iraq because it violated core principles of multilateralism and support for the United Nations. At the same time, senior Canadian officials, military officers and politicians were currying favour in Washington, privately telling anyone in the State Department of the Pentagon who would listen that, by some measures, Canada's indirect contribution to the American war effort in Iraq– three ships and 100 exchange officers– exceeded that of all but three other countries that were formally part of the coalition.\"\n\nAmongst the Canadian officers who were sent to Iraq were: Brigadier General Walter Natynczyk, who was later appointed Chief of the Defence Staff; Major General Peter Devlin, who served since 14 December 2006 as Multi-National Corps-Iraq Deputy Command General as part of his role as Deputy Commander of the US III Corps through an officer exchange program; and General Nicolas Matern, a special forces officer and former commander of Canada's elite counter-terrorism unit, who in mid February 2008 began service as deputy to Lieutenant General Lloyd Austin.\n\nEight Canadians were taken hostage in Iraq over the course of the conflict there; one, Zaid Meerwali, an Iraqi-Canadian truck driver, was killed in 2005, and another Iraqi-Canadian, Rifat Mohammed Rifat, has been missing since 2004 and is presumed dead. The 2005 abduction of James Loney and Harmeet Singh Sooden, both members of the organization Christian Peacemaker, garnered wide attention, as did their release the following year in a multi-national operation led by Task Force Black, involving British, American, and Canadian special forces, supported by Task Force Maroon, Joint Task Force 2, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and Canadian Security Intelligence Service. The remaining four Canadians taken hostage included: Fadi Ihsan Fadel, a Syrian-Canadian employed by the International Rescue Committee who was taken hostage in Najaf on 8 April 2004 and released eight days later; Naji al-Kuwaiti, was taken hostage on 28 April 2004 and released on 4 May of the same year; Fairuz Yamucky, who was abducted on 6 September 2004 and rescued by a United States National Guard unit sixteen days later; and Scott Taylor, a journalist abducted by Ansar al-Islam in Tal Afar on 9 September 2004 and held captive for five days.\n\nProtests against the Iraq War and counter-protests supporting the conflict took place in Canada both before and after the invasion of Iraq. One of the first large scale demonstrations in opposition to the war took place at Queen's Park, Toronto, where approximately 2,000 people gathered on 16 November 2002. The following day, as part of a cross-country day of action, a 3,000 strong anti-war coalition held a peace march from Peace Flame Park in Vancouver, approximately 1,000 people marched in Montreal, and about 500 individuals gathered in a snow storm on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, while other rallies took place in Edmonton, Winnipeg, and Halifax.\n\nCanadians also took part in a set of protests that took place in towns and cities around the world in February 2003, the biggest in Canada being the gathering of more than 100,000 people in Montreal, despite wind-chill temperatures of −30 °C (−22 °F). A further 10,000 people joined a demonstration in Toronto, 20,000 in Vancouver, 18,000 in Edmonton, 8,000 in Victoria, 4,000 in Halifax, 2,000 in Ottawa; altogether, protests were held in close to 60 communities across the country.\n\nDuring the Iraq War there were United States military personnel who refused to participate, or continue to participate, in that specific war. Their refusal meant that they faced the possibility of punishment in the United States according to Article 85 of the US Uniform Code of Military Justice. For that reason some of them chose to go to Canada as a place of refuge.\n\nThe choice of these United States Iraq war resisters to go to Canada has led to considerable debate in Canada's society, press, legal arenas, and political arenas. On 3 June 2008 and 30 March 2009, two motions were passed in the Parliament of Canada in support of the war resisters' efforts to stay in Canada. An Angus Reid Strategies poll taken on 6 and 7 June 2008, showed that 64% of Canadians agreed with that motion.

He studied at St Edmund's College, Ware, Hertfordshire, and at sixteen he joined Lloyd's of London as a clerk.\n\nHe meanwhile took evening classes at University College, London to prepare for the entrance examination of the Indian Civil Service.\n\nOn 9 July 1873, he passed the Indian Civil Service Examinations and was 'appointed by the (Her Majesty's) said [Principal] Secretary of State (Secretary of State for India) to be a member of the Civil Service at the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal'.\nOn 28 July 1873 he married Mary Lister at St Mary Abbots, the Parish Church of Kensington, London. Mary's father, Tom Lister, was the Estate Manager for the Earl of Stamford.\n\nIn September 1873 Edward Henry set sail for India. He arrived in Bombay and travelled across India arriving at Allahabad on 22 October 1873 to take up the position of Assistant Magistrate Collector within the Bengal Taxation Service.\n\nHe became fluent in Urdu and Hindi. In 1888, he was promoted to Magistrate-Collector. In 1890, he became aide-de-camp and secretary to the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal and Joint Secretary to the Board of Revenue of Bengal.\n\nOn 24 November 1890, as a widower, he remarried, by marrying Louisa Langrishe Moore.\n\nOn 2 April 1891, Henry was appointed Inspector-General of Police of Bengal. He had already been exchanging letters with Francis Galton regarding the use of fingerprinting to identify criminals, either instead of or in addition to the anthropometric method of Alphonse Bertillon, which Henry introduced into the Bengal police department.\n\nThe taking of fingerprints and palm prints had been common among officialdom in Bengal as a means of identification for forty years, having been introduced by Sir William Herschel, but it was not used by the police and there was no system of simple sorting to allow rapid identification of an individual print (although classification of types was already used).\n\nBetween July 1896 and February 1897, with the assistance of Sub-Inspectors Azizul Haque and Hemchandra Bose, Henry developed a system of fingerprint classification enabling fingerprint records to be organised and searched with relative ease. It was Haque who was primarily responsible for developing a mathematical formula to supplement Henry's idea of sorting in 1,024 pigeon holes based on fingerprint patterns. Years later, both Haque and Bose, on Henry's recommendation, received recognition by the British Government for their contribution to the development of fingerprint classification.\n\nIn 1897, the Government of India published Henry's monograph, \"Classification and Uses of Fingerprints\". The Henry Classification System quickly caught on with other police forces, and in July 1897 Victor Bruce, 9th Earl of Elgin, the Governor-General of India, decreed that fingerprinting should be made an official policy of the British Raj. This classification system was developed to facilitate orderly storage and faster search of fingerprint cards, called ten print cards. It was used when the ten print cards were catalogued and searched manually and not digitally. Each ten print card was tagged with attributes that can vary from 1/1 to 32/32.\n\nIn 1899, the use of fingerprint experts in court was recognised by the Indian Evidence Act.\n\nIn 1898, he was made a Companion of the Star of India (CSI).\n\nIn 1900, Henry was seconded to South Africa to organise the civil police in Pretoria and Johannesburg.\n\nIn the same year, while on leave in London, Henry spoke before the Home Office Belper Committee on the identification of criminals on the merits of Bertillonage and fingerprinting.\n\nIn 1901, Henry was recalled to Britain to take up the office of Assistant Commissioner (Crime) at Scotland Yard, in charge of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).\n\nOn 1 July 1901, Henry established the Metropolitan Police Fingerprint Bureau, Britain's first. Its primary purpose was originally not to assist in identifying criminals, but to prevent criminals from concealing previous convictions from the police, courts and prisons.\n\nHowever, it was used to ensure the conviction of burglar Harry Jackson in 1902 and soon caught on with CID. This usage was later cemented when fingerprint evidence was used to secure the convictions of Alfred and Albert Stratton for murder in 1905.\n\nHenry introduced other innovations as well. He bought the first typewriters to be used in Scotland Yard outside the Registry, replacing the laborious hand copying of the clerks.\n\nIn 1902, he ran a private telegraph line from Paddington Green Police Station to his home, and later replaced it with a telephone in 1904.\n\nOn Sir Edward Bradford's retirement in 1903, Henry was appointed Commissioner, which had always been the Home Office's plan.\n\nHenry is generally regarded as one of the great Commissioners. He was responsible for dragging the Metropolitan Police into the modern day, and away from the class-ridden Victorian era. However, as Commissioner, he began to lose touch with his men, as others before him had done.\n\nHe continued with his technological innovations, installing telephones in all divisional stations and standardising the use of police boxes, which Bradford had introduced as an experiment but never expanded upon.\n\nHe also soon increased the strength of the force by 1,600 men and introduced the first proper training for new constables.\n\nIn 1905, Henry was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) and the following year was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO). In 1910 he was made Knight Commander of the Bath (KCB). In 1911, he was created a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) after attending the King and Queen at the Delhi Durbar.\n\nHe was also a Grand Cross of the Dannebrog of Denmark, a Commander of the Légion d'honneur of France, and a member of the Order of Vila Viçosa of Portugal and the Order of St. Sava of Yugoslavia, as well as an Extra Equerry to the King.\n\nHenry was awarded the King's Police Medal (KPM) in the 1909 Birthday Honours.\n\nOn Wednesday 27 November 1912, while at his home in Kensington, Henry survived an assassination attempt by one Alfred Bowes (also reported as \"Albert\" Bowes), a disgruntled cab driver whose licence application had been refused.\n\nBowes fired three shots with a revolver when Sir Edward opened his front door: two missed, and the third pierced Sir Edward's abdomen, missing all the vital organs. Sir Edward's chauffeur then tackled his assailant. Bowes faced a life sentence for attempted murder.\n\nSir Edward appeared at court and followed a humane tradition of pleading for leniency for his attacker, stating that Bowes had wanted to better himself and earn a living to improve the lot of his widowed mother. Bowes was sentenced to 15 years' penal servitude, but Sir Edward maintained an interest in his fate, and eventually paid for his passage to Canada for a fresh start when Bowes was released from prison in 1922.\n\nSir Edward never really recovered from the ordeal, and the pain of the bullet wound recurred for the rest of his life.\n\nHenry would have retired in 1914, but the outbreak of the First World War convinced him to remain in office, as his designated successor, General Sir Nevil Macready, was required by the War Office, where he was Adjutant-General. He remained in office throughout the war.\n\nThe end of Henry's career came about due to the police strike of 1918. Police pay had not kept up with wartime inflation, and their conditions of service and pension arrangements were also poor.\n\nOn 30 August 1918, 11,000 officers of the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police went on strike while Henry was on leave. The frightened government gave in to almost all their demands. Feeling let down both by his men and by the government, whom he saw as encouraging trade unionism within the police (something he vehemently disagreed with), Henry immediately resigned on 31 August. He was widely seen as a scapegoat for political failures.\n\nOn 25 November 1918, Henry was created a baronet, and in 1920 he and his family retired to Cissbury, near Ascot, Berkshire.\n\nHe continued to be involved in fingerprinting advances and was on the committee of the Athenaeum Club and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, as well as serving as a Justice of the Peace for Berkshire. He died at his home in 1931 of a heart attack, aged 80.\n\nThe Baronetcy became extinct, since his only son (he also had two daughters), Edward John Grey Henry, had died in 1930 at the age of 22.\n\nHis grave lay unattended for many years. In April 1992, it was located in the cemetery adjoining All Souls Church, South Ascot by Metropolitan Police Fingerprint Expert Maurice Garvie & his wife Janis. After a presentation by Maurice Garvie to The Fingerprint Society on the Life & Times of Sir Edward, the Fingerprint Society agreed to the funding and restoration of the grave which was completed in 1994.\n\nIn the Metropolitan Police Fingerprint Bureau Centenary Year, 2001, at the suggestion of Maurice Garvie, English Heritage in honour of Sir Edward Henry unveiled a Blue Plaque on his former London home, 19 Sheffield Terrace, Kensington, W.8. The year before, following an approach by Maurice Garvie, Berkshire County Council unveiled on Sir Edward's retirement home 'Cissbury' a Berkshire County Council Heritage Green Plaque.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2316656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316656", "title": "Cogset", "text": "Cogset\n\nOn a bicycle, the cogset or cluster is the set of multiple sprockets that attaches to the hub on the rear wheel. A cogset works with a rear derailleur to provide multiple gear ratios to the rider. Cogsets come in two varieties, freewheels or cassettes, of which cassettes are a newer development. Although cassettes and freewheels perform the same function and look almost the same when installed, they have important mechanical differences and are not interchangeable.\n\nA freewheel (also known as a block) consists of either a single sprocket or a set of sprockets mounted on a body which contains an internal ratcheting mechanism and mounts on a threaded hub. Threaded rear hubs were available in different thread patterns depending on the country of manufacture, French and British threads being the most common. British C.E.I. (Cycle Engineers Institute) thread was adopted as the international standard and is now known as B.S.C. (British Standard Cycle). It is a standardized right-hand thread (1.375 x 24 TPI) onto which a standard freewheel is screwed. This allows different brands of freewheels to be mounted on different brands of hubs.\n\nThe major disadvantage of the multiple sprocket freewheel design is that the drive-side bearing is located inboard of the freewheel, and as sprockets were added over time, moved the bearing farther from the drive-side axle support. This resulted in more flexing stress being placed on the axle, which can bend or even break. Multiple speed freewheels were common on quality high end bikes until the late 1980s. Suntour — Maeda Industries (Japan) introduced a compact 6 speed freewheel which reduced the spacing between the sprockets and was the same width as a standard 5 speed freewheel but required a narrower chain than the standard. The concept was copied by European freewheel manufacturers Regina (Italy) and Maillard (France). As the number of sprockets on a multiple freewheel increased, clusters became physically wider, and the freehub design overcame the axle/bearing problem with threaded hubs and began to supersede the freewheel design. Today it is rare to find a freewheel on a new bicycle with more than seven speeds. Some new single-speed — especially BMX and utility bikes — and lower-end multi-geared bicycles continue to be manufactured and sold with freewheels.\n\nPedaling forces tighten a freewheel onto the hub, so no tool is required to install one. The ratcheting mechanism prevents the freewheel being loosened when the sprockets are turned counter-clockwise. A freewheel can be removed from the hub with one of the many specific freewheel removal tools that engages a spline or set of notches on the outboard end of the freewheel. Removal often requires considerable effort due to the large torque that tightens the freewheel during pedaling, and some freewheels cannot be removed intact. Future removal of a freewheel is facilitated by grease on the freewheel threads before installation.\n\nCassettes are distinguished from freewheels in that a cassette has a series of straight splines that form the mechanical connection between the sprockets and the cassette compatible hub, called a freehub, which contains the ratcheting mechanism. The entire cassette is held on the hub by means of a threaded lockring. Some cassette systems from the late 1980s and early 1990s use a threaded small sprocket to hold on the larger splined sprockets. Cassettes resemble freewheels when installed, but are clearly different when removed as they do not contain a freewheel's internal ratcheting mechanism.\n\nThe sprockets in a cassette are usually held together by three small bolts or rivets for ease of installation. These keep the sprockets and spacers in the correct order and position when they are removed from the freehub body. When the sprockets need to be replaced due to wear or the user wishes to change gear ratios available, only the sprockets are replaced, not the ratchet mechanism. Cassettes also allow the use of sprockets with fewer teeth, as in micro drive systems.\n\nThe ratchet mechanism, known as the freehub body, is still replaceable on most hubs, but forms a structural part of the hub. Cassette systems have a major advantage in that the drive-side axle bearing can be out near the frame, rather than being back towards the centre of the axle behind the freewheel. This greatly reduces the stress on the rear axle, making bent or broken axles extremely rare.\n\nSince their introduction in the late 1970s cassettes have been used on increasing numbers of bicycles, starting at the high-end and over time becoming available on less expensive bikes. Today the vast majority of derailleured bicycles use this newer design.\n\nOver time, the number of sprockets in a cogset has increased, from three or four before World War II, to five used from the 1950s to the 1970s, up to the eight, nine, ten, eleven, or twelve now found on modern bikes. As more rear sprockets were added, the combination became wider, and the sprocket spacing narrower. One of the ways to make space for this was the axle length (measured as the Over Locknut Distance — O.L.D.) was increased, necessitating more dish on the rear wheel drive side with a threaded hub to centre the wheel in the frame. The hub flanges spacing was not shortened on threaded hubs, rather the axle length increased from 120 mm O.L.D. (five-speed/compact six) to 126 mm O.L.D. (six-speed/compact seven) through to 130 mm O.L.D. (threaded seven-speed) for a road bike. MTB rear spacing is normally 135 mm O.L.D. Another advantage of the Shimano cassette hubs introduced from 1978 was that the rear hub flanges were wider apart than those of a threaded hub, so built a stronger wheel with less dish and without the problem of increased bearing stress or axle failure.\n\nBefore the introduction of indexed shifting, the width of a five-speed or compact six freewheel was approximately 32 mm; the introduction of indexed shifting supposedly made standardized sprocket spacing necessary. Shimano and Campagnolo both came up with independent standards, and SRAM later followed Shimano's lead in respect to sprocket spacing and cassette width. The width of early Shimano six- and seven-speed cassettes was 36 mm, and early eight-speed 40 mm wide. Shimano then changed again and standardised eight-eleven speed cassettes on 41.5 mm and second generation seven-speed to 38 mm. The widening of the sprocket carrier on the cassette hubs to 41.5 mm resulted in a decrease in the distance between the hub flanges.\n\nFor Shimano and SRAM the cassette spacing developed as follows. Early Shimano seven-speed cassettes are 36 mm wide, with sprocket spacing of 3.65 mm, but levers and rear derailleurs are not compatible with later Shimano seven-speed cassettes, which are 38 mm wide and have 3.2 mm sprocket spacing. An eight-speed cassette is wider at 41.5 mm than a second generation Shimano seven. This results in functionally compatible shifters, but specific freehub bodies, or necessitating the use of a spacer with a seven-speed cassette on an eight-speed hub. Eight- and nine-speed cassettes and freehub bodies have the same width (41.5 mm), yet the sprockets on the nine-speed are closer together; as a result the shifters are not compatible, but they use the same freehub bodies. Ten-speed cassettes are slightly more \"narrow\" than eight/nine so they fit on those freehubs but need a spacer, conversely eight/nine-speed cassettes do not fit on ten-speed freehubs.\n\nThis progression has provided more fine adjustment of gear ratio, however the use of thinner metal parts has had the effect of shortening the life-span of the chain and sprockets due to so called \"stretching\" of the chain. This is caused by frictional abrasion of the load-bearing surfaces of the chain causing elongation. As such, the chain and sprockets of a nine-speed system require more frequent replacement than an eight. The narrowing of the hub flanges has created more dish in the wheel, which weakens the wheel if all other factors are the same, but improvements in the strength and reliability of spokes and rims has more than balanced this out, and wheel strength is generally higher despite the increased dish.\n\nShift ramps are complex tooth profiles, in the rear sprockets and front chainrings, designed to pick up and drop the chain during shifting. They allow for shifting under greater load than was previously possible, and for smoother and cleaner shifting. The different systems are branded Hyperglide by Shimano, UltraDrive by Campagnolo, and OpenGlide by SRAM. The chain itself is specifically manufactured for ease of shifting, and to interface with a particular manufacturer's shift ramps; using a different type of chain may result in sub-optimal shifting.\n\n\n"}

He attended Dover Grammar School, took a double first in English at Jesus College, Cambridge and studied Art Nouveau book illustration at the Courtauld Institute of Art. In 2006 he entered a Civil Partnership with his longtime companion, prize-winning artist and photographer Ying Yeung Li.\n\nIn the 1960s Taylor wrote on cinema for \"Sight and Sound\" and the \"Monthly Film Bulletin\", on the theatre in \"Plays and Players\", on television for \"The Listener\" and the \"Times Educational Supplement\", and on various subjects relating to the arts for \"The Times Literary Supplement\". From the late 1950s he began writing anonymously on television and theatre for \"The Times\", and by 1962 he had become the paper's film critic, initially anonymous but later named after the paper abandoned its anonymity rule in January 1967 when William Rees-Mogg became editor. During this era he wrote a number of books including \"Anger and After: A Guide to the New British Drama\" (1962), titled \"The Angry Theatre\" in the USA; revised and expanded and published in paperback (1969); \"Anatomy of a Television Play\" (1962), concerning the \"Armchair Theatre\" productions \"Afternoon of a Nymph\" and \"The Rose Affair\"; \"Cinema Eye, Cinema Ear: Some Key Film-Makers of the Sixties\" (1964); and \"The Art Nouveau Book in Britain\" (1966).

He served from 3 August 2005 to 5 September 2008. From Sydney, Iemma attended the University of Sydney and the University of Technology, Sydney. A member of the Labor Party, he was first elected to the Parliament of New South Wales at the 1991 state election, having previously worked as a trade union official. From 1999, Iemma was a minister in the third and fourth ministries led by Bob Carr. He replaced Carr as premier and Leader of the New South Wales Labor Party in 2005, following Carr's resignation. Iemma led Labor to victory at the 2007 state election, albeit with a slightly reduced majority. He resigned as premier in 2008, after losing the support of caucus, and left parliament shortly after, triggering a by-election. He was replaced as premier by Nathan Rees.\n\nIemma was born in Sydney, the only child of Giuseppe and Maria Iemma, migrants from Martone, Calabria, Italy. Maria Iemma worked in the clothing trade, and Giuseppe Iemma, a communist supporter in Italy, worked as a machine labourer. Morris joined the Labor Party when he was 16. He was educated at state schools in Sydney, including the now-closed Narwee Boys' High School, and has an economics degree from the University of Sydney and a law degree from the University of Technology, Sydney.\n\nIn 1997 Iemma married Santina Raiti, with whom he has four young children.\n\nIemma is a member of the dominant right-wing faction of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party. From 1984 to 1986 he was an official with the Commonwealth Bank Employees Union. He then worked as an adviser to Senator Graham Richardson who held the environment and social security portfolios in the Bob Hawke and Paul Keating federal governments.\n\nIn 1991 Iemma was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for the seat of Hurstville, defeating a sitting Liberal member, with the slogan \"A local who listens\". When the seat of Hurstville was abolished in 1999, he won a tough pre-selection battle for the safe seat of Lakemba, which included part of the old seat of Hurstville. Iemma held Lakemba until his resignation in 2008.\n\nIemma was Minister for Public Works and Services and Minister Assisting the Premier on Citizenship (1999-2003), and as Minister for Sport and Recreation (2001-2003), and was Minister for Health (2003-2005). His tenure as Health Minister was generally free of major controversy, although he has said of the Health portfolio: \"it is one of the biggest and most difficult jobs in government\".\n\nWhen Bob Carr announced his intention to retire as New South Wales Premier on 3 August 2005, Iemma immediately announced his candidacy to succeed him as leader of the NSW Labor Party and thus as Premier. Police Minister Carl Scully was also a candidate, but on 29 July he withdrew. Iemma was the only candidate when the Labor Caucus met on 2 August to elect a new leader. He was formally appointed by Professor Marie Bashir, the Governor of New South Wales, on 3 August.\n\nIemma immediately faced a number of resignations. Deputy Premier and Treasurer Andrew Refshauge, and senior minister Craig Knowles, once considered a potential leader himself, both declared they would leave politics. Iemma took the Treasury portfolio for himself. Among his first policy moves as new Premier, Iemma announced the immediate repealing of the vendor tax (a tax on investment property) that was introduced by the Carr government in 2003.\n\nOpinion polls in August showed that Labor under Iemma's leadership was maintaining the lead over the Liberal opposition it had enjoyed under Carr, despite Iemma's relatively low profile. His short-term position was improved by the sudden resignation of Liberal leader John Brogden. This was seen in the results of the by-elections on 17 September caused by the resignation from Parliament of Carr, Refshauge and Knowles. Labor retained all three seats - Maroubra (Carr's seat) very easily, Macquarie Fields (Knowles's seat) comfortably, despite a substantial swing to the Liberals, and Marrickville (Refshauge's seat) despite a strong challenge from the Greens. In Marrickville, where the Labor candidate was Education Minister Carmel Tebbutt (switching from the Legislative Council), the Labor primary vote increased in the absence of a Liberal Party candidate.\n\nDespite its relatively short term in office, the Iemma Government faced significant service delivery problems in transport, health care and future water supplies. Sydney newspapers consistently asserted that Iemma's government was more interested in \"spin\" than policy development. Other embarrassments beset his premiership. For example, in February 2006, while awaiting the start of a COAG media conference in Canberra, while chatting to Victorian Premier Steve Bracks and not realising cameras were operating, Iemma was recorded as saying:\nNevertheless, in the months leading up to his first election as Labor leader, he maintained a comfortable lead in various opinion polls and was re-elected in the March 2007 election. Labor was returned with 52 seats compared to 35 for the Coalition.\n\nOn 15 July 2007, after several failures on the NSW rail system, Iemma claimed that the government was at war with rail unions. In November 2007 the Iemma government lifted the ban on genetically modified canola production and started the process of privatising the state's electricity system. On 3 May 2008 the New South Wales ALP's State Conference rejected, by 702 to 107 votes, the Iemma government's plans to privatise the state's electricity system.\n\nOn 5 September 2008, Iemma announced his resignation as Premier after losing the support of his caucus faction over the details of a proposed cabinet reshuffle sparked by the resignation of Deputy Premier John Watkins. Iemma had proposed that five other Ministers also depart, including Treasurer Michael Costa and Health Minister Reba Meagher. Iemma's faction, Centre Unity, supported the sacking of the Treasurer but not the other four Ministers. Faced with this rejection, Iemma resigned. The caucus unanimously selected Nathan Rees as his Premier in his stead.\n\nIemma resigned from parliament on 19 September 2008, ending his 17-year political career, and forcing a by-election in the seat of Lakemba, won by Robert Furolo.\n\nIn May 2009, Iemma was admitted to hospital suffering from an acute brain inflammation—viral meningitis. As a result, he lost movement in his legs and underwent physiotherapy with the goal of recovering full use of his legs. Iemma has served as chair of the South Eastern Sydney Local Health District Board since 1 January 2011 and on the boards of the Cancer Institute NSW and the Sydney Cricket & Sports Ground Trust.\n\nIn January 2013, there was speculation that Iemma was considering standing for the Division of Barton in the Australian House of Representatives for Labor at the 2013 federal election to replace former Attorney-General Robert McClelland who on that day announced that he would be retiring from parliament after 17 years. Iemma, however, decided not to contest the preselection in Barton, and the preselection instead went to Steve McMahon.\n\nIn November 2012 and March 2014 Iemma was called before the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in relation to allegations of corrupt behaviour by Eddie Obeid regarding a dispute between Australian Water Holdings and Sydney Water; and in relation to allegations of corrupt behaviour by Ian Macdonald and Obeid regarding the issuing of lucrative mining licences near . Both Obeid and Macdonald were found by ICAC to have acted in a corrupt manner regarding the issuing of mining licences and criminal charges were laid.\n\nThe Morris Iemma Indoor Sports Centre, named in honour of Iemma and operated by the City of Canterbury in partnership with the YMCA NSW, is a modern sports facility that caters for a variety of indoor sports, including netball, basketball, soccer and volleyball as well as incorporating a gym, change rooms, cafeteria and childcare services. The facility was opened in March 2011.\n\n"}
{"id": "2316723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316723", "title": "Church of Uganda", "text": "Church of Uganda\n\nThe Church of Uganda is a member province of the Anglican Communion. Currently there are 37 dioceses which make up the Church of Uganda, each headed by a bishop.\n\nEach diocese is divided into archdeaconries, each headed by a senior priest known as an archdeacon. The archdeaconries are further subdivided into parishes, headed by a parish priest. Parishes are subdivided into sub-parishes, headed by lay readers. As of the 2014 Census, 32% of Ugandans consider themselves affiliated with the church, down from 36.7% at the 2002 Census.\n\nThe current primate and metropolitan archbishop is Stephen Kaziimba, who was enthroned in March 2020. The Diocese of Kampala is the fixed episcopal see of the archbishop, but unlike many other fixed metropolitical sees, the incumbent is not officially known as \"Archbishop of Kampala\", but bears the longer title \"Archbishop of Uganda and Bishop of Kampala\".\n\n\"The primary source for this section is listed in the References section below\"\n\nShergold Smith and C. T. Wilson of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) were the first European Anglican missionaries to Uganda when they arrived in June 1877. They, along with others who arrived later, were based in the court of the Kabaka of Buganda near present-day Kampala.\n\nKabaka Mutesa I was known for his brutality and used the rivalries of the Anglicans, Roman Catholics and Muslims against each other to try to balance the influences of the powers that backed each group. His successor, Kabaka Mwanga II, took a more aggressive approach by expelling missionaries and insisting Christian converts abandon their faith on pain of torture or death.\n\nIn 1885, three Anglican Ugandans were killed and the arriving Archbishop of the Province of Eastern Equatorial Africa, James Hannington, together with his party were arrested, detained and later executed at the orders of the Kabaka. Joseph Mukasa, a Roman Catholic priest and an official of the Bugandan court, rebuked the deed and was arrested and beheaded. This was the precursor to the large scale persecutions and killings from 1886 to 1887 of Anglicans and Roman Catholics. Those who were killed in that period are remembered as the Martyrs of Uganda.\n\nThis incident brought about the interference of Imperial British East Africa Company who backed a rebellion against Mwanga II by Christian and Muslim groups. Mwanga II was eventually overthrown in 1888 and was replaced by his half brother, Kiwewa. Kiwewa himself was overthrown by the Muslim faction in the court and was replaced by his Muslim brother, Kalema. British forces forced Kalema to abdicate and restored the throne to Mwanga II who in 1894 acceded to Uganda's status as a British protectorate. These incidences guaranteed the long term viability of the Anglican church in Uganda.\n\nAlfred Robert Tucker was made the third bishop of Eastern Equatorial Africa in 1890 and in 1899, the Diocese of Uganda was created and Tucker became the first Bishop of Uganda. In 1893 the first Ugandans were ordained and Buganda was established as a centre for evangelisation in the Great Lakes Area. One of the most celebrated indigenous Anglicans of that period is Apolo Kivebulaya, who is also known as the \"Apostle to the Pygmies\" for his work among the Pygmy people in eastern Congo.\n\nAnglican growth in Uganda thrived by the turn of the 20th century and among the most notable contribution of the Anglican church was in the area of education. The first elementary schools were established in the 1890s. In 1913, the Bishop Tucker Theological College was established in Mukono and this institution was eventually expanded into what is now today the Uganda Christian University. Likewise the CMS took a lead in public health with the establishment of the Mengo Hospital in 1897.\n\nTucker proposed controversial measures to the Church constitution that would grant considerable power to the indigenous Anglicans in what was known as the Native Anglican Church. These radical proposals were opposed by the missionaries which resulted in a church hierarchy that was primarily expatriate until the independence of Uganda decades later. The domination of the CMS, and its later offshoot BCMS, led to a low church tradition in the Church. Revivalism was also made a hallmark of the Church with the outbreak of the East African Revival that began in Rwanda in 1936.\n\nIn the 1950s, the emergence of a generation of Ugandan Church leaders began to replace the expatriate hierarchy. Festo Kivengere, who later became the Bishop of Kigezi in 1972, travelled to Europe as an evangelist for the first time. As an international figure he was a joint founder of African Evangelistic Enterprise.\n\nIn 1961, the growth of the Church of Uganda was recognised in the Anglican Communion with the establishment of the Province of Uganda and Ruanda-Urundi (later Province of Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi); the new province was inaugurated by Geoffrey Fisher, Archbishop of Canterbury, on 16 April 1961 at Namirembe Cathedral. Leslie Brown, Bishop of Namirembe (Bishop of Uganda until 1960), was elected in 1960) and installed (at the province's inauguration service) as first Primate, metropolitan, and archbishop. Brown was succeeded in 1966 by the first Ugandan archbishop, Erica Sabiti.\n\nRelationships between the Anglicans and Roman Catholics that have been strained since the fighting of 1892 saw a new turn with the establishment of Uganda Joint Christian Council. This has included the small Orthodox Church of Uganda.\n\nIn 1971, Idi Amin gained power in a coup d'état and was initially greeted with enthusiasm by the general population of Uganda. The brutal and corrupt nature of the regime became evident soon and with the consecration of Janani Jakaliya Luwum as the new archbishop in 1974, the Anglican Church became more outspoken in opposition to the policies of Amin. This led to the 1977 execution of the Archbishop on Amin's orders.\n\nThe overthrowing of Amin in 1979 saw the gradual resumption of normal life in Uganda although peace remained elusive in northern Uganda with the insurgency by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). In 1997, Winifred Ochola, the wife of the first Bishop of Kitgum was killed by a landmine. Bishop Ochola has however continued to be committed in working towards peace and reconciliation in northern Uganda\n\nIn 1980, Rwanda and Burundi were elevated to a separate province. The Church of Uganda has played an active role in promoting AIDS awareness and prevention in Uganda. As a result of these efforts and others in the country, Uganda has begun reversing the effects of AIDS on her society.\n\nOn 28 September 2011, the House of Bishops elected the first bishop for the new diocese of South Ankole, which was created from parts of the dioceses of Ankole and West Ankole.\n\n\"The primary source for this section is referred in the References section below\"\nLike many other Anglican churches, the Anglican Church of Uganda is a member of the ecumenical World Council of Churches. In October 2009, the Ugandan Church's leadership reacted to the Vatican's proposed creation of personal ordinariates for disaffected traditionalist Anglicans by saying that although he welcomed ecumenical dialogue and shared moral theology with the Catholic Church, the current GAFCON structures already meet the spiritual and pastoral needs of conservative Anglicans in Africa.\n\nThe Church of Uganda has been active in the Anglican realignment, both at the Global South and the Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans. They are one of the African churches which broke communion with the Episcopal Church of the United States due to their acceptance of non-celibate homosexuality, and have agreed to provide pastoral oversight and support to new Anglican churches in North America in the ongoing Anglican realignment. In 2005, Archbishop Henry Orombi, then the Primate, also criticised the Church of England's acceptance of clergy in same-sex civil partnerships.\n\nOn 2 September 2007, the Ugandan church consecrated an American bishop, John Guernsey, from Virginia, to oversee many of the American parishes which it supports. The Church of Uganda declared itself in full communion with the Anglican Church in North America, a denomination formed by American and Canadian Anglicans opposed to their national churches' actions regarding homosexuality, on 23 June 2009.\n\nIn 2013, Archbishop Ntagali disapproved of the Church of England's decision to allow clergy in civil partnerships to become bishops. He said, \"It is very discouraging to hear that the Church of England, which once brought the Gospel of Jesus Christ to Uganda, has taken such a significant step away from that very gospel that brought life, light, and hope to us.\" Archbishop Ntagali also reiterated his opposition to similar decisions made by other western Anglican provinces. “Sadly we must also declare that if the Church of England continues in this contrary direction we must further separate ourselves from it and we are prepared to take the same actions as those prompted by the decisions of The Episcopal Church (USA) and the Anglican Church of Canada ten years ago.”\n\nThe Church of Uganda was represented at GAFCON III, held in Jerusalem, on 17–22 June 2018, by a large 272 members delegation, including Archbishop Stanley Ntagali.\n\n"}

{"id": "2316735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316735", "title": "Manuel Zelaya", "text": "Manuel Zelaya\n\nJosé Manuel Zelaya Rosales (born 20 September 1952) is a Honduran politician who was President of Honduras from 27 January 2006 until 28 June 2009. He is the eldest son of a wealthy businessman, and inherited his father's nickname \"Mel\". Before entering politics he was involved in his family's logging and timber businesses.\n\nElected as a liberal, Zelaya shifted to the political left during his presidency, forging an alliance with the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas known as ALBA. On 28 June 2009, during the 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis, he was seized by the military and sent to Costa Rica in a coup d'état. On 21 September 2009 he returned to Honduras clandestinely and resurfaced in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa. In 2010 he left Honduras for the Dominican Republic, an exile that lasted more than a year.\n\nHe now represents Honduras as a deputy of the Central American Parliament. Since January 1976 Zelaya has been married to Xiomara Castro de Zelaya, who was a presidential candidate in the 2013 general election but lost to Juan Orlando Hernández.\n\nThe surname 'Zelaya' is a word from the Basque language, which means 'field'.\n\nZelaya was born the eldest of four children in Juticalpa, Olancho. Two of his brothers remain alive. Zelaya's mother, Ortensia Rosales de Zelaya, has been described as his best campaigner. His family first lived in Copán, then they moved east to Catacamas, Olancho.\n\nHe attended Niño Jesús de Praga y Luis Landa elementary school and the Instituto Salesiano San Miguel. He began his university studies in civil engineering, but left in 1976 with 11 courses completed, for agriculture and the forestry sector. He was forced to take over the family business by the arrest of his father José Manuel Zelaya Ordoñez, implicated in the murders known as \"Slaughter of the Horcones.\" These murders also involved Mayor José Enrique Chinchilla, Sub-Lieutenant Benjamín Plata, José Manuel Zelaya Ordoñez (property owner) and Carlos Bhar. They were charged and taken to the Central Prison; after four years in prison, they were favored with a pardon from the head of state, General Policarpo Paz García, in 1979. He has engaged in business activities that including timber and cattle, handed down to him by his late father. He is now a landowner in Olancho. In 1987, Zelaya became manager of the Honduran Council of Private Enterprise (COHEP), as well as of the National Association of Wood Processing Enterprises. The COHEP occupies a particularly important role in Honduran politics, as the Constitution delineates that the organization elects one of the seven members of the Nominating Board that proposes nominees to the Supreme Court of Honduras.\n\nZelaya's father got a 20-year prison sentence for his role in the 1975 Los Horcones massacre, which took place on the Zelaya family ranch, \"Los Horcones\". As a result of an amnesty, he served less than two.\n\nZelaya joined the Liberal Party of Honduras, \"Partido Liberal de Honduras\", (PLH) in 1970 and became active a decade later. He was a deputy in the National Congress for three consecutive times between 1985 and 1998. He held many positions within the PLH and was Minister for Investment in charge of the Honduran Social Investment Fund (FHIS) in a previous PLH government. Under the administration of Zelaya the FHIS lost $40 million. Zelaya was accused of embezzlement but escaped prosecution.\nIn the 2005 presidential primaries, his faction was called \"Movimiento Esperanza Liberal\" (MEL). He received 52% of the 289,300 Liberal votes, vs. 17% for Jaime Rosenthal Oliva and 12% for Gabriela Núñez, the candidate of the Nueva Mayoría faction.\n\nDuring Zelaya's time in office Honduras became a member of ALBA, an international cooperation organization based on the idea of social, political, and economic integration between the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. It marked his turning to a left-of-center politics, the first such case of right to left policy switch as he had been elected in on a conservative platform. Political opponents, particularly business elites, opposed his foreign policy, including his alliance with Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, and friendship with Cuba's Raúl Castro.\n\nIn spite of a number of economic problems, there were a number of significant achievements under Zelaya's presidency. Under his government, free education for all children was introduced, subsidies to small farmers were provided, bank interest rates were reduced, the minimum wage was increased by 80%, school meals were guaranteed for more than 1.6 million children from poor families, domestic employees were integrated into the social security system, poverty was reduced by almost 10% during two years of government, and direct state help was provided for 200,000 families in extreme poverty, with free electricity supplied to those Hondurans most in need.\n\nOn 22 July 2008, Zelaya sought to incorporate Honduras into ALBA, an international cooperation organization based on the idea of social, political, and economic integration in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nZelaya said that the main media outlets in Honduras, owned by wealthy conservatives, were biased against him and did not cover what his government was doing: \"No one publishes anything about me. . . . what prevails here is censorship of my government by the mass media.\" Inter Press Service says that the vast majority of radio and TV stations and print publications are owned by just six families.\n\nAccording to a paper written by Manuel Orozco and Rebecca Rouse for the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in the United States, the Honduran media operate as arms of political parties. Honduran journalists say that most of the news media in Honduras are unabashedly partisan, allied with political parties and local power brokers.\n\nOn 24 May 2007, Zelaya ordered ten two-hour \"cadenas\" (mandatory government broadcasts) on all television and radio stations, \"to counteract the misinformation of the news media\". The move, while legal, was fiercely criticized by the country's main journalists' union, and Zelaya was dubbed \"authoritarian\" by his opposition. Ultimately, the broadcasts were scaled back to a one-hour program on the government's plans to expand telephone service, a half-hour on new electrical power plants and a half-hour about government revenues.\n\nAn unknown gunman in 2007 murdered a journalist who often criticized Zelaya. The Inter-American Press Association (IAPA) and the United Nations criticized threats against journalists in Honduras. Other critical journalists, such as Dagoberto Rodriguez and Hector Geovanny Garcia, fled into exile because of constant murder threats.\n\nThe Associated Press, citing Manuel Orozco of the Inter American Dialogue, said that \"His [Zelaya's] campaign for changing the constitution has energized his support base of labour groups, farmers and civil organisations who have long felt marginalized in a country where a wealthy elite controls the media and much of politics.\"\n\nManuel Zelaya appointed his nephew Marcelo Chimirri as General Manager of the state-owned telecom Hondutel.\n\nAccording to the Mexican newspaper \"El Universal\", relying on information supplied by the Arcadia Foundation, Hondutel's revenue decreased 47% between 2005 and 2006, the first year of President Manuel Zelaya's administration, despite Hondutel's monopoly on international calls In April 2009, Latin Node Inc., an American company, pleaded guilty to making improper payments to Hondutel, \"knowing that some, or all of those funds, would be passed on as bribes to officials of Hondutel\". Chimirri resigned in 2007, and was arrested following the coup. He remains in prison on charges of abuse of authority and embezzlement, charges he denies. Apart from Chimirri, Oscar Danilo Santos (the former manager of Hondutel), Jorge Rosa, and James Lagos are all charged in connection with allegedly committing crimes of abuse of authority, fraud and bribery having received bribes of $1.09 million U.S. from an international carrier in exchange for Hondutel providing that carrier lower rates than other firms. Auditor Julio Daniel Flores was charged for the lesser crime of violation of duties of officers.\n\nPresident Zelaya came to international attention in June 2009 when he was overthrown in a military coup and forced into exile. The crisis that led to his removal from office centered around the question of whether changes would be made to the 1982 Honduran Constitution. Zelaya proposed a national poll to gauge interest in constitutional change, which provoked a fierce reaction from opposition parties. Those responsible for the coup justified their actions on the grounds that Zelaya's interest in potentially convening a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution was illegal, and alleged that his real motive was to increase his time in office. Zelaya denied that his motive was to stay in office, stating that he intended to step down in January 2010 as scheduled, noting that his successor would be elected at the same time the vote on whether to convene a constituent assembly would occur.\n\nUnder constitutional law, the President of Honduras can amend the constitution without a referendum if a congressional majority exists. However, eight articles cannot be amended, including those related to term limits, the permitted system of government, and the process of presidential succession.\n\nBecause the president can amend 368 of the 375 articles in the Honduran constitution without calling a constituent assembly, some suspected that Zelaya's true intention was to extend his rule. One-time Christian Democrat presidential candidate Juan Ramon Martinez argued that Zelaya was attempting to discredit parliamentary democracy, saying, \"There appears to be a set of tactics aimed at discrediting institutions... he has repeated on several occasions that democratic institutions are worthless and that democracy has not helped at all\".\n\nOn 11 November 2008, following requests from many Honduran groups for the convening of a constituent assembly, Zelaya issued a decree organizing a poll to decide whether the electorate wanted a fourth ballot box installed at polling places for the upcoming 29 November 2009 General Election – an addition to the usual three for Presidential, Congressional, and municipal candidates. The fourth ballot would ask voters whether to convene a National Constituent Assembly for the purpose of writing a new constitution. In March 2009, Zelaya announced that he first wanted to have a preliminary poll – he suggested 28 June 2009 as a date – to ask voters whether they wanted the fourth ballot to be included in the November 2009 election.\n\nThere has been considerable debate as to whether Zelaya's call for a poll about whether to organize a constituent assembly was legally valid according to the 1982 Constitution. Article 373 of the Constitution states that the Constitution can be amended by a two-thirds majority of the normal National Congress. Only eight articles cannot be amended in this fashion; they are specified in Article 374 of the Constitution and include term limits, system of government that is permitted, and process of presidential succession. Because the congress can amend 368 of 375 articles without any constituent assembly, some observers charged that Zelaya's true intention of holding a referendum on convening a constitutional convention on the same date as his successor's election was to extend his term of rule. In a newspaper interview shortly before his removal from office, Zelaya stated that he had every intention of stepping down when his term ends in January 2010.\n\nThe Supreme Court, without deciding on the constitutionality of the poll, ruled that a lower court ruling blocking the referendum was lawful\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling was supported by Congress, the country's attorney general, top electoral body, and the country's human rights ombudsman, who all said that Zelaya violated the law. Despite the opposition of the other branches of the government, Zelaya moved forward with his plan to hold the poll on 28 June 2009. In Honduras the military assist with election logistics; So in late May 2009, Zelaya requested military help to distribute ballot boxes and other materials for the poll. The chief of the military, General Romeo Vásquez Velásquez, refused to carry this order out. In response, Zelaya dismissed Vásquez on 24 May. Subsequently, defense minister Edmundo Orellana and several other military commanders resigned in support of Vásquez. Both the Honduran Supreme Court and the Honduran Congress deemed the dismissal of Velásquez unlawful.\n\nBy 25 June, the newspaper \"La Tribuna\" reported that the military had deployed hundreds of troops around Tegucigalpa, to prevent possible disturbances by organisations that support Zelaya and with the exception of leftist organizations, \"all sectors are publicly opposed to the consultation, which has been declared illegal by the Prosecutor and the Supreme Court\". The troops were deployed from the First Infantry Battalion, located 5 km East of the city, to the vicinity of the presidential residence in the West, and the airport, in the South.\n\nThere is some doubt, however, that Zelaya ever actually fired Vásquez. CNN news on 27 June reported that Zelaya on 24 June had \"said that he would\" fire Vásquez; but that on 26 June Zelaya said that he had never carried out his threat and the general had not been fired. \"I didn't do it\", he told CNN.\n\nThe Congress, the attorney general, and the top electoral tribunal declared Zelaya's proposed referendum illegal. Congress began to discuss impeaching Zelaya. On 27 June and again on 30 June 2009, thousands of protesters opposed to Zelaya's marched through the capital city.\n\nOn 28 June 2009, the Supreme Court issued an order to detain President Zelaya, who was subsequently captured by the military. He was then brought to the air force base Hernan Acosta Mejia,\nand taken into exile in Costa Rica, precipitating the 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis.\n\nThe reason given for the arrest order were charges brought by the Attorney General. The rationale of the order was to enable a statement before the Supreme Court. The decision to expatriate Zelaya was however taken by the military themselves, knowing full well that expatriation violated the constitution. The military offered as justification that they exiled Zelaya \"to avoid mob violence\".\nFollowing the coup, Zelaya spoke to the media from his forced exile in San José. He identified the events as a coup and a kidnapping. Soldiers pulled him from his bed, he said, and assaulted his guards. Zelaya announced that he would not recognize anyone named as his successor, and that he wanted to finish his term in office. He also stated that he would begin to meet with diplomats, and attended the Summit of Central American presidents held in Managua, Nicaragua, two days later (30 June 2009).\n\nThe National Congress voted unanimously to accept what they said was Zelaya's letter of resignation. Zelaya said he did not write the letter.\n\nNational Congress President Roberto Micheletti, the next person in the presidential line of succession and a centre-Right, assumed the presidency following Zelaya's removal from office.\nThe event was greeted with applause in the national Congress.\n\nInternational bodies like the United Nations, the Organization of American States, and the European Union publicly condemned the events. U.S. President Barack Obama said, \"We believe that the coup was not legal and that President Zelaya remains the President of Honduras.\" Hugo Chávez threatened to invade Honduras if the Venezuelan embassy or ambassador were attacked. Venezuela has said it would suspend oil shipments, and Honduras's neighbors—El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua—suspended overland trade, and lifted the ban after two days.\nA one-page United Nations resolution, passed by acclamation in the then 192-member body, condemned the events and demanded Zelaya's \"immediate and unconditional restoration\" as president. The resolution calls \"firmly and categorically on all states to recognise no government other than that\" of Mr. Zelaya.\n\nDuring the first five days out of country, Zelaya spent 80,000 dollars of Honduran public money on goods including hotels, food and clothing, continuing to spend on his expenses as the president of the country.\n\nZelaya's wife, Xiomara Castro de Zelaya, charged that the exiling of her husband was a violation of the Honduran Constitution.\nArticle 102 of the Honduran Constitution forbids expatriating or handing over of Hondurans to foreign countries.\n\nFollowing the coup trends of decreasing poverty and extreme poverty were reversed. The nation saw a poverty increase of 13.2 percent and in extreme poverty of 26.3 percent in just 3 years. Furthermore, unemployment grew between 2008 and 2012 from 6.8 percent to 14.1 percent.\n\nOn 21 September 2009, Zelaya and his wife arrived at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa. Zelaya said that to reach the embassy he travelled through mountains for fifteen hours, and took back roads to avoid checkpoints. Zelaya did not state from which country he entered Honduras. Hundreds of Zelaya's supporters surrounded the Brazilian embassy. Zelaya chanted \"Restitution, Fatherland or Death!\" to his supporters, raising fears that Zelaya was attempting a violent confrontation.\n\nMichelletti initially denied that Zelaya had returned, but later admitted he had. Michelletti added that the return \"changes nothing of our reality\". Michelletti later issued a state of emergency with a curfew and asked the Brazilian government to put Zelaya in Honduran custody for trial. Brazilian foreign minister Celso Amorim stated that Brazil did not aid Zelaya's return. Security Vice-Minister Mario Perdomo ordered checkpoints on the highways leading to Tegucigalpa, to \"stop those people coming to start trouble\". Defense Minister Lionel Sevilla also suspended all air flights to Tegucigalpa.\n\nCosta Rican President Óscar Arias and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged both sides to begin a dialogue toward a peaceful solution and Eulogio Chavez, leader of a 60,000-member teachers union, announced that his organization would go on strike to back Zelaya. Shortly thereafter, Zelaya claimed that Israeli mercenaries had installed a mobile phone jammer.\n\nOn 27 September 2009 Honduras gave Brazil a ten-day deadline. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva replied that he would ignore the deadline. \"Brazil will not comply with an ultimatum from a government of coup-mongers\". Lula said. Honduran interim president Roberto Micheletti warned that his government would take action if Brazil did not determine Zelaya's status soon. President Lula requested an apology. Hundreds of Honduran soldiers and Police Officers surrounded the Brazilian embassy, where protests against the coup continued.\n\nOn 29 October 2009, the government of \"de facto\" president Roberto Micheletti signed what United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called a \"historic agreement\" to let Manuel Zelaya serve the remaining three months of his term. \"If Congress agrees\", according to Elisabeth Malkin of \"The New York Times\", \"control of the army would shift to the electoral court, and the presidential election set for 29 Nov. would be recognized by both sides. Neither Mr. Zelaya nor Mr. Micheletti will be candidates\".\n\nWhen Micheletti announced he had, unilaterally, formed the unity government without input from Zelaya, Zelaya declared the agreement \"dead\" early on 6 November. The United States sent diplomats to help to resurrect the pact, but Zelaya insisted that he would not accept any deal to restore him to office if it meant he must recognize the elections of 29 November.\n\nOn 29 November 2009, a presidential election was held under a state of emergency declared in Decree PCM-M-030-2009. According to the decree, the Secretary of State of the 'de facto' government was expected to participate in the military command for this state of emergency. Five of the six presidential candidates retained their candidacies, while Carlos H. Reyes had withdrawn his candidacy on 9 November in protest at what he perceived as illegitimacy of the election. Zelaya called for a boycott of the poll. Some Hondurans interviewed by Associated Press said that they \"sought to move past the crisis with the elections\", which had been scheduled previous to Zelaya's removal. Early returns indicated that conservative Porfirio Lobo was elected with around 55% of the votes. Official numbers for the turnout of the election falsely placed it at around 60%, but subsequently revised the numbers to 49% turnout.\n\nOrganisations and individuals in Honduras, including the National Resistance Front against the coup d'état in Honduras, Marvin Ponce of the Democratic Unification Party, and Bertha Oliva of COFADEH, and internationally, including Mercosur, President Cristina Kirchner of Argentina and\nthe Union of South American Nations, said that elections held on 29 November under Micheletti would not be legitimate.\n\nOn 2 December, the National Congress began debate regarding the possible reinstatement of Zelaya to the presidency.\n\nOn 4 December, Juan Barahona-led activists ended five months of daily protests demanding the reinstatement of Zelaya, saying they were moving on now that Congress has voted to keep Manuel Zelaya out of office. Juan Barahona, who had been leading protests since late June when Zelaya was forced out of the country, said that his supporters are \"closing that chapter\" of their struggle. Barahona said it was time for Hondurans who support policies in favor of the poor and other themes that Zelaya espoused to shift their focus to the 2014 elections.\n\nOn 20 January 2010, the Dominican Republic and Honduran President-elect Lobo agreed to a deal that would allow Zelaya to be transported safely from the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa where he had been, to the Dominican Republic upon Lobo taking office on 27 January. Lobo stated that he would ensure Zelaya would leave safely and \"with dignity.\" Lobo negotiated with Dominican President Leonel Fernández. Lobo also discussed the situation with former presidential candidates, who signed onto a joint statement on the agreement, which also requested that sanctions against Honduras as a result of the coup be lifted. The next day, Zelaya agreed to the deal. A close advisor said Zelaya would remain politically active and hoped to later return to political activity.\n\nZelaya left Honduras on 27 January 2010 for the Dominican Republic, along with his wife, two children, and President Fernández of the Dominican Republic. Zelaya and his family lived in the Dominican Republic until his return in 2011. Several countries in the region continued to see Zelaya as the legitimate Honduran head of state.\n\nHonduran President Porforio Lobo met with Zelaya in Cartagena, Colombia on 22 May 2011. They both signed an agreement that allowed Zelaya to return to Honduras from exile. Six days later, on 28 May, Zelaya flew back to Honduras aboard a Conviasa jet and was greeted by thousands of his supporters at the airport. He gave a conciliatory speech that called for political reconciliation and increased democracy in the country.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, emails by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were released subsequent to disputes over the Secretary's use of private email accounts for government communications. Some critics, who are not named in this article, have argued that, despite President Obama's public support for Zelaya and condemnation of the coup, these communications suggest that the Secretary seemed more interested in ensuring that previously scheduled elections for the new president proceeded in November, rather than taking a strong stand insisting that Zelaya be restored in the meantime. And Zelaya himself has criticized both Clinton and the Obama administration saying, \"On the one hand, they condemned the coup, but on the other hand, they were negotiating with the leaders of the coup.\"\n\n"}

It was first released on August 27, 2002, by Immortal Records and distributed by Virgin Records. The album was produced by Bob Ezrin, Brian Virtue, and Thirty Seconds to Mars, and was recorded in rural Wyoming during 2001 and early 2002. It had been in the works for a couple of years, with lead vocalist Jared Leto writing the majority of the songs.\n\n\"30 Seconds to Mars\" was described as a concept album centering on human struggle and self-determination, characterized by personal lyrics that use otherworldly elements and conceptual ideas to illustrate a truthful personal situation. The album incorporates progressive sounds with influences and elements from new wave, space rock, and electronica. Upon release, \"30 Seconds to Mars\" received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who commended the album's lyrical content and the band's musicianship, which has been compared to the works of Pink Floyd, Tool, and Brian Eno.\n\nThe album debuted at number 107 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and number one on the US Top Heatseekers. It was a slow-burning success that eventually sold two million copies worldwide. It produced two singles, \"Capricorn (A Brand New Name)\" and \"Edge of the Earth\". Thirty Seconds to Mars promoted the album by opening concerts for bands such as Puddle of Mudd, Incubus, Sevendust, and Chevelle.\n\nBy 1998, Thirty Seconds to Mars was performing gigs at small American venues and clubs. When they first started, lead vocalist Jared Leto did not allow his vocation as a Hollywood actor to be used in promotion of the band. They played their first concerts under different names, before finally settling on the name \"Thirty Seconds to Mars\", which was taken from a rare manuscript titled Argus Apocraphex. During this period, the band recorded demo tracks such as \"Valhalla\" and \"Revolution\", or \"Jupiter\" and \"Hero\", which later appeared on the debut album as \"Fallen\" and \"Year Zero\" respectively, but also \"Buddha for Mary\". Their work led to a number of record labels being interested in signing Thirty Seconds to Mars, which eventually signed to Immortal Records. In 1999, Virgin Records entered into the contract.\n\nThe work of Thirty Seconds to Mars generated the interest of record producer Bob Ezrin, who had previously worked on several groundbreaking projects, including \"The Wall\" by Pink Floyd, \"Love It to Death\" by Alice Cooper, and \"Destroyer\" by Kiss. Thirty Seconds to Mars contacted Ezrin because they felt that he had the ability to help them achieve their own vision and create a distinct sound; moreover, the band's members grew up listing to his work with Pink Floyd, Kiss and Alice Cooper. Brian Virtue, who had previously worked with Jane's Addiction, joined the band and Ezrin in producing the record.\n\nThirty Seconds to Mars retreated to the isolation of Wyoming's countryside in 2001 to record the album, tentatively titled \"Welcome to the Universe\". The band and Ezrin chose an empty warehouse lot on 15,000 acres, starting an intense period of preproduction focused on fifty songs. The isolation allowed the band to work at a different pace. Jared Leto said that while recording in Wyoming, \"there was an interesting dichotomy, a kind of contradiction with the technology and the organic world that we were surrounded [...] It's something that I think ended up in the music\". Ezrin helped the band to understand the importance of an album's structure and how to create a progression, rather than a simple series of singles. \"We really wanted to create something that had depth,\" Leto explained. He described the process of working with Ezrin as tumultuous but also fulfilling, having its own dynamics. He also stated that Virtue was a key element in helping the band define their sound.\n\nThe track \"Fallen\", originally titled \"Jupiter\", was the first to be produced for the album. Thirty Seconds to Mars initially thought to exclude the track from the record since they were not satisfied with it, but then they decided to rework the song because there were people who had strong feelings about it. The track features programming by Danny Lohner and background vocals by Maynard James Keenan. Several musicians, including Elijah Blue Allman, Renn Hawkey, as well as producers Ezrin and Virtue, contributed on selected tracks.\n\nThe style of the album combined progressive metal and space rock with influences and elements from new wave and electronica, utilizing programming and synthesizers. According to Jared Leto, the band wanted to create \"something that had cohesiveness and kind of an atmospheric musical story to it\". He identified groups that had a sense of identity and atmosphere as being influential on the album's songwriting. He cited classic stoner rock artists, to which he and his brother Shannon had listened while growing up. Eventually, they gravitated toward more conceptual work like Pink Floyd, David Bowie and The Cure. Thirty Seconds to Mars also drew influences from acts such as Björk, Rush, and Depeche Mode; according to Shannon Leto, the inspirations derived from \"mostly big conceptional bands; bands that had depth; bands that were dynamic\".\n\nThe sound of \"30 Seconds to Mars\" takes on many musical stylistic shifts. Elizabeth Bromstein from \"Now\" magazine described it as a concoction of '80s electronics, industrial music and nu metal with a heavy dose of progressive rock. Jaan Uhelszki of \"Alternative Press\" felt that the album is made of \"sterner stuff\", with the band's prog-metal foundation \"enhanced by an unexpectedly powerful sense of melody\". Smiley Ben of BBC Collective noted in the album alternative rock tendencies. Ryan Rayhill from \"Blender\" found the album befitting prog-rock prototypes Rush and opined that Thirty Seconds to Mars \"emerged with an eponymous debut that sounds like Tool on \"The Dark Side of the Moon\"\", referring to the 1973 album by Pink Floyd.\n\n\"30 Seconds to Mars\" is a concept album focusing on human struggle and self-determination. It deals with characters who battle with social alienation, emotional isolation, and political malaise. The title itself \"30 Seconds to Mars\" indicates the accelerated human society and suggests a potential escapism from it. The album's lyrics describe the personal human experience through the use of metaphors and moments of fantasy. Jared Leto regarded it as a \"very personal album that sometimes uses otherworldly elements and conceptual ideas to illustrate a truthful personal situation\". He cited the human struggle as the most inspiring source for the band and explained that the record features \"a definite desire for change, for renewal, for a new beginning and ultimately, for escape\". Author Karin Lowachee commented that Leto, who wrote most of the lyrics, allows the listener to draw his or her own conclusions to the meanings of the songs. She noted that \"this makes the music especially personal, as whatever images you conjure from the sound and words can be interpreted by your own inner language\".\nOpening track \"Capricorn (A Brand New Name)\" deals with a desire for renewal. Leto, however, stated that he prefers to let the listener take its own understanding and meaning from the song, claiming that the interpretation, from individual to individual, is one of the most interesting aspects of music. The track \"Fallen\" faces the necessity to escape from the inner world that every person has created for itself. The lyrics of \"Oblivion\", originally titled \"The Reckoning\", lead into a frantic threat, in which \"Unity divides / Division will unite\". Leto described this paradox as a rather common but unfortunate occurrence. A dramatic narration drives \"Buddha for Mary\", whose story is not about a specific person and represents a metaphor. \"End of the Beginning\" features a foreboding tone and emphasizes the human nature in constant search for something. The album ends with the hidden track \"The Struggle\", whose lyrics were taken from the ancient Chinese military treatise \"The Art of War\", attributed to Sun Tzu.\n\nThe track \"Revolution\", excluded from the final track listing, was considered by some critics as having an anti-American tone. Leto rejected the claim and explained that it can be taken \"many different ways\" and if taken literally or politically, it could be misinterpreted. He said that the band \"didn't want a song like that to overshadow what we are about\" and especially after the September 11 attacks, they felt it did not fit thematically with the rest of the album, stating that \"it took on new dimensions\". The album features elements inspired by the science fiction novel \"Dune\" by Frank Herbert, which influenced the album's songwriting for its themes regarding the interactions of politics, religion, technology, and human emotion.\n\nThe photography for the album was handled by drummer Shannon Leto, with additional works provided by Ken Schles. The cover art features a teenage boy and some of the band's symbolism. It includes a phoenix logo, named \"Mithra\" by the band, that bears the motto \"Provehito in Altum\". Roughly translated from Latin, the phrase means \"Launch forth into the deep\". The band chose a phoenix for its association with rebirth and renewal in the Greek mythology. The group expressed interest in signs and symbols and their relationships with cultures and subcultures. The album's cover art was unveiled through the band's official website on July 29, 2002. However, it was not conceived to be the original concept for the artwork. The initial cover art was discontinued and destroyed during production following the September 11 attacks due to the graphic content of the image. It featured a fighter pilot ejecting from an exploding plane. Thirty Seconds to Mars explained that they never saw it as a violent image, but felt that it was inappropriate in the wake of the events.\n\n\"30 Seconds to Mars\" was released on August 27, 2002 on Immortal Records in the United States and September 30 on EMI in the United Kingdom. It was originally expected to be released in early 2002. However, the band was behind schedule and the cover design needed a reshoot. The album's compact disc featured enhanced material developed by Little Lion Studios, including a promotional video titled \"Capricorn\" directed by Lawton Outlaw, and a behind the scenes footage edited by Ari Sandel. The Japanese edition of the album included the bonus track \"Anarchy in Tokyo\". \"Capricorn (A Brand New Name)\" was the first single taken from \"30 Seconds to Mars\". It was issued a month before the album's release on July 23, 2002. It had an accompanying music video directed by Paul Fedor. \"Edge of the Earth\" was released as the album's second single on January 28, 2003, with a music video directed by Kevin McCullough.\n\nAfter five years since its original release, \"30 Seconds to Mars\" was made available in Australia on April 7, 2007 on Virgin Records. EMI re-issued a limited edition of the album in Japan on December 2, 2009. To commemorate the 10th anniversary of the album, Thirty Seconds to Mars hosted an event called MarsX on August 27, 2012. It was broadcast worldwide through the online platform VyRT and included live playback and commentary of the record with the band, interactive discussion focused on the formation of Thirty Seconds to Mars, and exclusive acoustic performances. The album was also re-issued as a limited edition picture disc. To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the long-playing vinyl, Universal Music re-issued a double LP of \"30 Seconds to Mars\" on September 23, 2016. A re-release on red translucent vinyl was pressed the following year in a limited edition for the 15th anniversary of the album.\n\nThe band promoted the album through a number of tours in North America. Even before its release, Puddle of Mudd invited Thirty Seconds to Mars to open a six-week tour for them in the spring of 2002. On January 30, Thirty Seconds to Mars began a promotional tour in North America. The band played its first European concert on June 24, 2002, at The Barfly in London, England. In July 2002, they began a club tour and also embarked on a North American tour supporting Incubus. In early October, they were invited by MTV to join the Campus Invasion Tour, playing ten dates in Canada alongside I Mother Earth, Billy Talent, and Pepper Sands. The band was also scheduled to open a spring tour for Adema but was forced to withdraw due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nAfter playing a series of shows supporting Our Lady Peace, Thirty Seconds to Mars opened an autumn tour for Sevendust. The band's first appearance on television was on \"Last Call with Carson Daly\" on November 18, which aired on November 27, 2002. It was the last performance with guitarist Solon Bixler, which left the band due to issues primarily related to touring. The band later performed on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" and \"The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn\", which marked the first live performance with guitarist Tomo Miličević. In 2003, the band went on tour with Chevelle, Trust Company, and Shihad, and played thirteen shows for Lollapalooza.\n\n\"30 Seconds to Mars\" earned mostly positive reviews upon release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 60, based on 5 reviews. Jason Pettigrew from \"Alternative Press\" regarded it as \"an ambitious, immense-sounding work that's at once rich in melody\" and \"lyrically jarring\". Ryan Rayhill from \"Blender\" noticed \"throbbing synths\" and \"exploding guitars\", and called the album a \"high-minded space opera of epic scope\" narrating \"tales of living in deep, black oblivion\". Smiley Ben of BBC Collective described the overall sound as \"certainly compelling\", and praised the sonic variety, writing that the band \"knowingly push[es] boundaries\" producing \"great music with an edge\". AllMusic reviewer Jon O'Brien called the record a \"highly ambitious space-themed concept album\", and commended its \"heavy, riff-laden\" guitars, \"soaring\" vocals and sci-fi lyrics.\n\nJohan Wippsson from \"Melodic\" claimed that the band has \"something new to add to the world\" with their space-influenced modern rock. Jeremy Gladstone of \"Kludge\" commented that the album reaches its peak with \"Buddha for Mary\", which he called a \"virtual sonic achievement\", but felt that the quality of the songs drops off at the halfway point, describing the entire project as \"top-heavy\". Canadian critic Karin Lowachee found the group's sound and vision reminiscent of their \"concept-styled forbears\" but \"uniquely owned\" for a contemporary audience, and wrote that the band \"defies the trend by stepping out ahead of it and into the future\", giving the listener something original to enjoy. Amber Authier from \"Exclaim!\" echoed this sentiment, stating that the band stretched musical borders and represented something that is \"a little different\", offering a \"solid sound\".\n\nMitch Joel from \"Blistering\" commended the band's musical diversity, noting that they are \"worth more than most of their peers on a song-by-song magnitude.\" Elizabeth Bromstein of \"Now\" magazine found the track-to-track variation limited, although she appreciated the range of styles. Peter Relic of \"Rolling Stone\" gave a mixed response, stating that the album has its finer moments but felt that it is undone by Jared Leto's \"baffling, pretentious poetry\" and the \"sanitized quality of the heavy guitars. \"Q\" magazine described it as having \"a polished sheen\", but opined that the \"earnest, sci-fi-tinged lyrics gets monotonous\" over the course of the album. In contrast, Jason D. Taylor from AllMusic commented that the \"space-age themes complement the group's advanced musical achievements wonderfully\". Megan O'Toole of \"The Gazette\" felt that every track on the album is a \"unique masterpiece that simultaneously operates on a number of different musical and spiritual levels\", writing that its music has the potential to \"affect and infect the deepest recesses\" of the soul.\n\nIn the United States, \"30 Seconds to Mars\" entered the \"Billboard\" 200 at number 107 on the issue dated September 14, 2002. It also debuted at number one on the Top Heatseekers. After nine weeks, it fell to number 40, with sales of over 40,000 units. As of August 2006, Nielsen SoundScan estimates actual sales of the album at over 120,000 in the United States. Its lead single, \"Capricorn (A Brand New Name)\", entered the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart at number 40 and eventually reached a peak of number 31. In the United Kingdom, although the album never charted, it was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in July 2013, denoting shipments of over 60,000 units.\n\nIn France, \"30 Seconds to Mars\" debuted at number 142 on the national albums chart on October 5, 2002. After its release to the Australian market, the album entered the ARIA Charts at number 95 on the issue dated June 11, 2007. It peaked at number 89 the following week. In Greece, it entered the national albums chart in June 2011, in view of a band's concert held in Athens in July, reaching a peak of number 41. \"30 Seconds to Mars\" was a slow-burning success, and eventually sold two million copies worldwide as of March 2011.\n\nJason D. Taylor of AllMusic considered the release of \"30 Seconds to Mars\" a \"daring new step in musical evolution\" and noted that its impact left \"vast corridors of sound open for the listener to meander down at will\". He commented that Thirty Seconds to Mars managed to record an album that \"breathes life\" into the \"empty shell that corporate rock has become\", and felt that in \"reanimating an avenue of musical expression that has for many years been on its deathbed\", the band possibly offered the best rock experience of 2002. \"30 Seconds to Mars\" was named one of the best albums of 2002 by a number of publications, including \"CMJ New Music Report\", \"Kludge\", \"Melodic\", and \"Metal Hammer\". Johan Wippsson of \"Melodic\" regarded it as \"one of the most unique album when it comes to an own style\", while music critic Megan O'Toole from \"The Gazette\" felt that the band managed to \"carve out a unique niche for themselves in the rock realm\".\n\nA writer of MuchMusic called the album a \"work that is built to last\", noting that the band produced \"something unique\" with \"depth and substance\". Artistdirect agreed and explained that \"30 Seconds to Mars\" established the group as \"fresh, new force\", revealing a \"multi-faceted outfit that thrived on creative exploration and escape\". Jon O'Brien, writing for AllMusic, labelled the album one of the \"more convincing actor-turned-rock star\" efforts. In a retrospective review in 2012, Ian Winwood from \"Kerrang!\" deemed the record an \"epic starting point\" for the music that followed, and stated that it displayed Jared Leto's \"vast, cinematic writing style\". He considered its music \"undoubtedly the most aggressive they've created\" and regarded lead single \"Capricorn (A Brand New Name)\" as the band's \"most muscular moment\".\n\nCredits adapted from \"30 Seconds to Mars\" album liner notes.\nThirty Seconds to Mars\n\nAdditional musicians\nProduction\n"}

It reviewed all films on release in the United Kingdom, including those with a narrow arthouse release.\n\n\"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" was edited in the mid-1950s by David Robinson, in the late 1950s and early 1960s by Peter John Dyer, and then by Tom Milne. By the end of the 1960s, when the character and tone of its reviews changed considerably with the arrival of a new generation of critics influenced by the student culture and intellectual tumult of the time (not least the overthrow of old ideas of \"taste\" and quality), David Wilson was the editor. It was then edited by Jan Dawson (1938 – 1980), for two years from 1971, and from 1973 until its demise by the New Zealand-born critic Richard Combs.\n\nIn 1991 \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" was merged with \"Sight & Sound\", which had until then been published quarterly - \"Sight & Sound\" then became a monthly publication and took up \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\"'s remit to review all films released in the UK.\n\n\"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" was originally published to allow UK cinema managers to decide what films to show, hence the complete cast and production lists, full plot followed by a thorough critique. Only films that had been registered with the UK government trade authority were covered each month. During the years of full supporting programmes, \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" printed long lists of B-features and short films with brief capsule reviews; by the 1970s, the tone and style of its reviews had changed considerably, and was increasingly influenced in some cases by the auteur theory and Marxist-influenced film theory, though some more traditional critics such as John Gillett remained, and others such as David McGillivray and Paul Taylor took exploitation movies more seriously than had previously been considered acceptable, while Steve Jenkins wrote a lengthy defence in 1981 of \"Glen or Glenda\". Another change was that all reviews had a byline - up to September 1968, only the reviews of films considered more significant by the BFI had a partial byline of initials only (so Tom Milne would be \"T.M.\"). From January 1971, all films were listed in alphabetical order, mainly because a new wave of critics who were influencing the magazine had already overturned the assumptions implicit in the separation of films (for example, several by Sergio Leone and many from the stable of Roger Corman were only included in the \"shorter notices\" section). From the July 1982 issue, \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" changed again to include more feature articles, interviews, and photographs.\n\n\"The Monthly Film Bulletin\"s many contributors included:\n"}

{"id": "2316761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316761", "title": "Operation Vistula", "text": "Operation Vistula\n\nOperation Vistula () was a codename for the 1947 forced resettlement of the Ukrainian minority as well as Boykos and Lemkos from the south-eastern provinces of post-war Poland, to the Recovered Territories in the west of the country. The action was carried out by the Soviet-installed Polish communist authorities with the aim of removing material support and assistance to the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. The Ukrainian Insurgent Army continued its guerilla activities until 1947 in both Subcarpathian and Lublin Voivodeships with no hope for any peaceful resolution. Operation Vistula effectively brought an end to the hostilities.\n\nIn a period of three months beginning on 28 April 1947 and with Soviet approval and aid, about 141,000 civilians residing around Bieszczady and Low Beskids were forcibly resettled to formerly German territories, ceded to Poland at the Yalta Conference at the end of World War II. The operation was named after the Vistula River, \"Wisła\" in Polish. Some Polish and Ukrainian politicians as well as historians condemned the operation following the 1989 fall of communism in Eastern Europe, and described it as ethnic cleansing. Others pointed out that no other means of stopping the violence existed at the time since partisans used to regroup outside the Polish borders.\n\nDuring Operation Vistula the conditions of the United Nations Charter of 26 June 1945, on the right of self-determination and international laws, were respected. The deported farmers received financial help from the Polish government and took over homes and farms left behind by the Germans, in some cases experiencing an improvement in their living conditions as a result of the increased size of the newly acquired properties, their brick construction, and the provision of running water. In the years 1956 to 1958 they received mostly non-repayable credits totalling 170 million PLN which was a considerable amount of money in the Polish national budget. At exactly the same time the Soviet Union carried out a parallel operation, dubbed \"Operation West\", in the Ukrainian SSR. Although both operations were coordinated from Moscow, there was a shocking difference between their outcomes. Operation West was conducted in West Ukraine by the Soviet NKVD and targeted the families of suspected UPA members. Over 114,000 individuals, mostly women and children, were deported to the Kazakh SSR and Siberia and forced into extreme poverty. Of the 19,000 adult males deported by the NKVD deportees, most were sent to coal mines and stone quarries in the north. None of the people deported by the NKVD received any farms or empty homes to live in.\n\nThe stated goal of the operation was to suppress the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), which had been fighting the communist Polish People's Army in the south-eastern territory of the Polish People's Republic. The original codename of the operation was \"Akcja Wschód\" (Operation East), similar to Operation West (\"Akcja Zachód\") conducted by the NKVD on the Soviet side of the border. It is sometimes assumed that the direct cause for Operation Vistula was the assassination on 28 March 1947 of the Polish communist General Karol Świerczewski in an ambush set up by UPA. About 12 hours after the incident, the Polish communist authorities made the decision to deport all Ukrainians and Lemkos away from the embattled region. It is known, however, that preparations for Operation Vistula had started already in January 1947, if not earlier. On 10 September 1947 the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union issued an Order № 3214-1050, for the deportation of all Ukrainian families of alleged UPA members to Siberia. Between 1945 and 1947 over 126,000 Ukrainians were apprehended by the NKVD and almost 32,000 of the Ukrainian underground were killed, attesting to the continuity of the same Soviet policy from before 1947.\n\nThe operation was carried out by the Operational Group Vistula consisting of about 20,000 personnel commanded by General Stefan Mossor. The group included soldiers of the Polish People's Army and the Internal Security Corps, as well as functionaries of the police Milicja Obywatelska and the Security Service Urząd Bezpieczeństwa. The operation commenced at 0400 hours local time on 28 April 1947. Initially, the expellees comprised about 20,000 Ukrainians and Lemkos. With time, the total number grew to 80,000 and eventually to 150,000 inhabitants of Polesie, Roztocze, Pogórze Przemyskie, Bieszczady, Low Beskid, Beskid Sądecki, and Ruś Szlachtowska.\n\nThe expellees were resettled over a wide area in the Northern and Western Territories assigned to Poland by the Potsdam Agreement including Warmia and Masuria. They received financial credits and material help from the government, including grain shipments and other foodstuffs. Their new homes were renovated with public funds; in Olsztyn Voivodeship 2,427 houses were rebuilt by the state, in Szczecin Voivodeship, only 717 although the needs were exponentially greater: reaching 10,000 households, far beyond the available state budget. Most of their personal debts, however, were remitted in the following years.\n\nA consequence of Operation Vistula was the almost total depopulation of Pogórze Przemyskie, Bieszczady and Beskid Niski coupled with the NKVD-led forcible repatriation of Ukrainians from Poland to the Soviet Union (the Ukrainian SSR and Siberia) in 1944–46. The relocation of the population put the UPA forces in Poland in the most difficult position; deprived of human and other resources, the outnumbered Ukrainian partisans were unable to uphold their armed resistance against the communist forces. Nevertheless, the UPA remained active for a few more years. After the last relocations, UPA's activities on Polish territory died out. Some Ukrainian partisans fled to Western Europe, notably to West Germany, and the United States.\n\nThe deportations occurred in stages. Poland and the Soviet Ukraine conducted population exchanges resulting from bilateral agreements signed on 9 September 1944 and 16 August 1945. The first transfers occurred at the end of World War II. The Poles who resided east of the newly established borders were deported to new Poland over three years. In 1944 the expulsion from Ukraine involved 117,000 Poles officially. In 1945 the number swelled to 512,000 Poles. In 1946 the total was 158,500 Poles from the Ukrainian SSR alone.\n\nSome 482,000 Lemkos, Rusyns and Ukrainians were deported to the Ukrainian SSR between September 1944 and April 1946, although some 300,000 remained in their native settlements within the borders of Poland. Many Ukrainians and Lemkos as well as tens of thousands of Poles (ca. 200,000 persons or more) fled from south-eastern Poland to central Poland between 1944 and 1945 independently of treaties due to the pacification campaign by the Bandera faction.\n\nOperation Vistula occurred within the Polish national borders. The transfer involved persons who were internally relocated as citizens of the country. The final relocation of Ukrainians and Poles between the state borders occurred in 1951, when Poland was forced by the Soviet Union to adjust the border in the upper San River area and in the Belz area for economic reasons. Poland gave up rich deposits of coal including the city of Bełz that was in Poland, and in exchange, was assigned a stretch of barren land with low quality soil and no natural resources east of the San River and south of Przemyśl. The new Soviet acquisitions went to Ukraine, and populations were exchanged. Following the transfer of land, the Soviets built large coal mines there with the total capacity of 15 million tons annually.\n\nSome five thousand Lemko families returned to their home regions in south-eastern Poland in 1957 and 1958. While the Polish census of 2003 shows only 5,800 Lemkos (self-identification), there are estimates that up to 100,000 Lemkos in total live in Poland today, and up to 10,000 of them in the area known as Lemkovyna. The largest communities of Lemkos live in the villages Łosie, Krynica, Nowica, Zdynia, Gładyszów, Hańczowa, Zyndranowa, Uście Gorlickie, Bartne, Bielanka, and in the eastern part of Lemkovyna – Wysoczany, Mokre, Morochów, Szczawne, Kulaszne, Rzepedź, Turzańsk, Komańcza. Also in the towns Sanok, Nowy Sącz, and Gorlice.\n\nOn 3 August 1990, the Polish Senate adopted a resolution condemning the postwar Polish government's Operation Vistula. In response, the Ukrainian Parliament (Verkhovna Rada) adopted the statement of understanding of the Polish Senate resolution as a serious step towards the correction of the injustices towards the Ukrainians in Poland. In the same resolution the Rada condemned the criminal acts of the Stalinist regime towards the Polish people.\n\nOn 18 April 2002 in Krasiczyn, Polish President Aleksander Kwaśniewski expressed regret over Operation Vistula. The President described the operation as the symbol of harm against Ukrainians committed by the communist authorities. \"Speaking on behalf of the Republic of Poland I want to express regret to all those wronged by the operation\" - Kwaśniewski wrote in a letter to the National Remembrance Institute (IPN) and participants in the conference on the 1947 Operation Vistula and openly rejected the notion that it should in any way be linked to earlier events in Volhynia. \"It was believed for years that the Vistula operation was the revenge for slaughter of Poles by the UPA forces in the east in the years 1943-1944. Such attitude is wrong and cannot be accepted. The Vistula operation should be condemned.\"\n\nIn 2007 the presidents of Poland (Lech Kaczyński) and Ukraine (Viktor Yushchenko) condemned the operation as a violation of human rights. President Yushchenko also noted that the operation was executed by and was the responsibility of a \"totalitarian communist regime\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2316786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316786", "title": "Hawkshaw the Detective", "text": "Hawkshaw the Detective\n\nHawkshaw the Detective was a comic strip character featured in an eponymous cartoon serial by Gus Mager from February 23, 1913 to November 12, 1922 and again from December 13, 1931 to 1952. (The revival was a topper to \"The Captain and the Kids\".) The name of Mager's character was derived from the common American slang of the time, in which a \"hawkshaw\" meant a detective—that slang itself derived from playwright Tom Taylor's use of the name for the detective in his 1863 stage play \"The Ticket of Leave Man\".\n\nHawkshaw the Detective was based on one of Mager's \"monk\" characters (so called because they looked a lot like monkeys), \"Sherlocko the Monk,\" who made his first appearance in 1910. That name was scrapped after Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, threatened legal action over the parodied name. (Sherlocko's bumbling partner Watso did not survive the renaming, either; he became \"The Colonel.\")\n\nSherlocko used careful examination of clues and his knowledge of human nature to solve the crimes. Almost invariably they were done by some other \"monk\" character in the course of his regular activities (Groucho, Forgetto, Henpecko, Nervo ...)\n\nAn earlier version of Sherlocko, entitled \"Knocko the Monk,\" spawned a fad of nicknames ending in O, which prompted a vaudeville monologist named Art Fisher, while playing poker with four brothers who performed together, to give them all such names. One of the brothers got a name that belonged to one of the characters in the strip: Groucho, one of the monks. Fisher named the other brothers Harpo, Chicko (later re-spelled \"Chico\") and Gummo. At various times, however, the different Marx Brothers provided different reasons for the names, so \"Knocko the Monk\" may not, in fact, have been the inspiration.\n\nHawkshaw the Detective, played originally by Horace Wigan, debuted in the 1863 play of Tom Taylor, \"The Ticket of Leave Man\". His character was taken up by the \"New York World\" on February 23, 1913, and continued for many years in various Pulitzer-owned newspapers. In 1917, some of Hawkshaw and the Colonel's newspaper antics were republished in book form by the Saalfield Company.\n\nIn 1912 the comic strip was adapted in two live-action comedy films, \"The Robbery at the Railroad Station\" and \"The Henpeckos\".\n\n"}

He holds the distinction of being the first Estonian soldier serving in an independent Estonian army to be killed in combat since 1920, and the first Estonian soldier to be killed in the Iraq War.\n\nNuiamäe's death shocked the population of Estonia and sparked a debate amongst the country's citizens on whether Estonia should continue to keep troops stationed in Iraq. However, the Estonian government held firm in its stance to remain part of the \"Coalition of the Willing\".

The album was intended as a comeback for the band, whose previous album \"The Revölution by Night\" failed to attain Gold status following the success of 1981's \"Fire of Unknown Origin\" and 1982's \"Extraterrestrial Live\". \"Club Ninja\" sold more than 175,000 copies, falling well short of gold status again, and because of its high cost, Columbia Records executives deemed it a commercial failure. The album was re-issued on compact disc on March 10, 2009, by Sony-owned reissue label American Beat Records, which had also reissued the band's 1988 album, \"Imaginos\".\n\n\"Club Ninja\"'s first single, \"Dancin' in the Ruins,\" was a minor radio and MTV hit. \"When the War Comes\" features a brief spoken-word introduction by radio personality Howard Stern, whose cousin was married to guitarist and vocalist Eric Bloom.

He is one of the few over-the-board grandmasters who also holds the title of Grandmaster of International Correspondence Chess. Suttles has been inactive in over-the-board play since the mid-1980s. He currently serves with the software firm Magnetar Games, as President and Chief Technologist.\n\nSuttles was born in San Francisco, California, but moved to Canada during the American draft. He was of National Master strength by his mid-teens, which was unusual for Canadian chess at that time. His early mentor was mathematician and master Elod Macskasy.\n\nSuttles made his first appearance in the Closed Canadian Chess Championship at Brockville, 1961, at age 15, and scored 3/11. Suttles won the British Columbia Championship in 1963 and 1966. In his second Closed, he scored 8½ from 15 games at Winnipeg 1963, finishing just above the middle of the strongest and youngest field yet seen in a Canadian final. Suttles tied for 3rd–5th places in the 1964 Canadian Open Chess Championship in Toronto, and as the top junior, qualified for the 1965 Junior World Chess Championship. At home in Vancouver for the 1965 Canadian Championship, Suttles scored 8/11 and finished second, behind eight-time champion Daniel Yanofsky. As a dual Canadian-American citizen, Suttles was also eligible for the United States Championship, New York City 1965–66, in which he finished last with 2½/11, an event won by Bobby Fischer.\n\nSuttles attended the University of British Columbia, and represented the school in interuniversity chess competition. He earned his undergraduate degree in mathematics, and began doctoral-level studies, but did not complete his PhD.\n\nSuttles represented Canada at the Junior World Chess Championship, Barcelona 1965, but was drawn into a strong preliminary group which included the eventual winner Bojan Kurajica, and could only score 1½/4, failing to advance to the finals. Suttles did manage to win the 'B' final, ahead of Raymond Keene. Suttles represented Canada in the qualifying Interzonal event for the World Chess Championship at Sousse 1967, scoring 9½/21 for 15th place. Suttles won the Canadian Chess Championship held at Pointe-Claire 1969, after a playoff match with Zvonko Vranesic in Toronto, which Suttles won by 2½–1½. He took another crack at the Interzonal level at Palma de Mallorca 1970, scoring 10/23 for a tied 15–16th place, but did not qualify for the final Candidates' matches that would choose the title challenger.\n\nSuttles appeared at age 18 on the Canadian Olympiad team for Tel Aviv 1964, for the first of his eight selections, including six in a row, over a period of 20 years. He usually played a large number of games in these team events, close to the maximum. Here are his complete results; his totals for Canada in Olympiads are: (+49 −30 =43), for 57.8 percent. He also played board one for Canada on its bronze medal winning team at the 1971 Student Olympiad.\n\n\nSuttles became a Canadian citizen in 1966, and married his wife Dobrila in 1968.\n\nSuttles was already of Grandmaster strength by 1968, and in fact qualified for the grandmaster title at the Lugano Olympiad. However, he was denied the title on the basis of a technicality, that he had played (and won) one more than the required number of games in the event. Instead, Suttles settled for the International Master title, earned in 1967 at the Sousse Interzonal. He finally achieved the Grandmaster title at the San Antonio tournament of 1972, gaining the last half-point he needed against Armenian Grandmaster and former world champion Tigran Petrosian.\n\nHe won the Canadian Open Chess Championship at Ottawa 1973. He also won the 1973 \"La Presse\" Open in Montreal. Suttles tied for first place in the U.S. Open Chess Championship at Chicago 1973, scoring 10/12 and defeating GM Walter Browne in the last round. Suttles placed clear second in the 1974 Canadian Open Chess Championship in Montreal with 9½/11, losing only to the winner Ljubomir Ljubojević.\n\nHe won the Western Canadian Open, Vancouver 1981, defeating Tony Miles and Yasser Seirawan in the final two rounds. He won his final Canadian event, the 1984 Vancouver Futurity.\n\nWhile taking a break from over-the-board chess, he won a pre-computer era high level correspondence chess tournament, the Heilimo Memorial, played from 1978–1981. He was awarded the title of International Grandmaster of Correspondence Chess in 1982, making him one of the very few players to hold GM titles both for over the board chess and chess by correspondence.\n\nIn his youth, Suttles was strongly influenced by Aron Nimzowitsch, and became well known due to his preference for hypermodern openings. He was perhaps the world's leading advocate of the Modern Defence from the mid-1960s, and showed that this line, a universal defence against any White opening move, was fully playable, which had not been the case before his time. The line was nicknamed the 'Rat', for the Black fianchettoed bishop which kept dodging around in its holes! As White, Suttles favoured 1.e4, with a predilection for the Closed Variation against the Sicilian Defence, and the baroque Vienna Game after 1.e4 e5. He occasionally played the English Opening (1.c4) as well. By the early 1970s, he was frequently opening with 1.g3 as White, aiming for a reversed Modern Defence, another new opening idea. His unique skills – such as the avoidance of main opening lines, use of a defensive kingside fianchetto, development of knights to unusual squares, and sudden eruption of tactics – are well illustrated by the selection of games listed below, which are all characteristic of Suttles at his best.\n\nSuttles was the leader in a group of strong young British Columbia masters mentored by the veteran Macskasy. The players competed hard head-to-head, but also worked together, learned from each other, and employed original playing styles to largely dominate Canadian chess for the better part of a decade. Other members of this group from the late 1960s included Peter Biyiasas, Bruce Harper, Jonathan Berry, and Robert Zuk.\n\nIn the book \"The World of Chess\" (1974), authors Anthony Saidy and Norman Lessing described Suttles as the 'most original strategist since Nimzowitsch'.\n\nA significant project, entitled \"Chess on the Edge\", includes the largest annotated collection of his games, more than 600 in all. Simultaneous publication of the three volumes took place in March, 2008, with the publisher being the Chess'n Math Association. FM Bruce Harper, one of Suttles' students, led the effort, with assistance from GM Yasser Seirawan, Dutch IM Gerard Welling, and GMC Jonathan Berry.\n\n\n\n"}

During the summers of 1985 and 1987, he marched as a bugler with the renowned Garfield Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps from Garfield, New Jersey. The corps won the Drum Corps International World Championships in both those years. Weston still plays trumpet, as on the albums \"The Sea and the Bells\" by Rachel's (1996) and \"Things We Lost in the Fire\" by Low (2001).\n\nIn 1988, he earned a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Lowell in Lowell, MA. While working at the University's campus radio station, WJUL, he began mixing live performances of Boston-area bands such as Pixies and the Blake Babies.\n\nIn 1987 Weston joined The Volcano Suns, playing bass guitar. The group was led by Peter Prescott, (previously the drummer for Mission of Burma, who had broken up in 1983).\n\nWeston joined Steve Albini and Todd Trainer in Shellac in 1991. Under Albini, Weston honed his studio production skills and has gone on to record and mix material for bands including Sebadoh, June of 44, Polvo, The Coctails, Archers of Loaf, Chavez, Rachel's, Ken Vandermark, 33.3 and Rodan. Weston was also Albini's Assistant Engineer on Nirvana's \"In Utero\" album. According to a 2006 interview, being a musician has helped shape Weston's work recording, mixing and mastering: \"It’s obvious to me that the best recording engineers have played in bands. You understand the dynamic better and can almost become an unofficial band member during the session. And it’s pretty easy to tell on what sort of session your musical opinion is wanted or not.\" However, Weston's recording and mixing work is not limited to music: he occasionally freelances for National Public Radio, often working on comedy quiz show \"Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me\", which is headquartered in Chicago.\n\nIn 2002, Weston joined the reunited Mission of Burma, taking the place of Martin Swope as tape manipulator and live engineer for the band. He appears on and recorded the albums \"ONoffON\", \"The Obliterati\", \"The Sound The Speed The Light\", and \"Unsound\".\n\nIn early 2007, Weston opened Chicago Mastering Service with Jason Ward on Chicago's west side.\n\n\n"}

Gurney's \"The Grand Manner\" at Lincoln Center Theater in the summer of 2010, opposite Kate Burton, Boyd Gaines and Brenda Wehle.\n\nSteggert starred as Will Bloom in the musical version of \"Big Fish\" alongside Norbert Leo Butz and Kate Baldwin. It ran for 98 performances from September 5 through December 29, 2013. Ben Brantley's \"New York Times\" review (October 6, 2013) said, \"Mr. Steggert's singing exudes a radiant sincerity that transcends corn.\"\n\nHe co-starred (as Will Ogden) with Tyne Daly in the premiere of Terrence McNally's \"Mothers and Sons\" at the Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, Pennsylvania. It had a limited run of 14 performances from June 13 to June 23, 2013. The cast was interviewed by Theatre Sensation's Kelli Curtin: \"Bobby Steggert plays the character of Will in this play. Steggert describes his character as, \"a modern gay man where being a husband to a man and having children is a viable option. My character represents the progress that has been made in society. My character is strong willed, steadfast in point of view and I admire that about him.\" According to Steggert, this play is important because it is about relationships and families. He states, \"Twenty years ago a play like this would be classified as a 'gay drama.' Now a play that addresses issues faced by gay people is mainstream. The characters in this play are interesting because they are people and not because of their sexuality.\" Steggert is hopeful that people that see this play will \"broaden their definition of family after seeing \"Mothers and Sons\" through observing the family on stage.\" \n\nIn March 2016 Steggert starred Off-Broadway in the title role of Adam, in Anna Zeigler’s \"Boy\" at the Clurman Theatre.\n\nAround 2016, Steggert \"completely turned my back on an acting career that I had spent twenty years building.\" He earned a Master’s in Social Work from Columbia University and trained as a therapist at the Institute of Contemporary Psychotherapy in their Gender and Sexuality Program. In an announcement of his retirement from acting, he stated, \"if I ever return to acting, it will be with this knowledge (and I hope it reminds you of your own possibilities) — that the work does not stop when unemployed — that you are an artist every day, if you so choose — that art is an obligation, and that it must be lived, not simply offered to those who have paid the price of admission.\"\n\nFor his role in \"Ragtime,\" Steggert was nominated for a 2010 Tony Award, Drama Desk Award, Outer Critics Circle Award, and a Drama League Award.\n\nFor his role in \"Yank!,\" he received nominations for the Drama Desk Award (2010) and New York Innovative Theatre Awards (2008).\n\nPrior to \"Ragtime,\" Steggert was nominated for an Outer Critics Circle Award in 2007 for his portrayal of Jimmy Curry in the Broadway revival of \"110 in the Shade,\" and 2008 Drama League Award and Drama Desk Award nominations for his starring role in \"The Slug Bearers of Kayrol Island.\" \n\n\nIn September 2013, \"Out\" magazine reported that Steggert is gay.\n\n"}

{"id": "2316836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316836", "title": "New Zealand nationality law", "text": "New Zealand nationality law\n\nNew Zealand nationality law determines who is and who is not a New Zealand citizen. The status of New Zealand citizenship was created on 1 January 1949 by the \"British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act 1948\". Prior to this date, New Zealanders were only British subjects and New Zealand had the same nationality legislation as the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries (see also British nationality law).\n\nThe 1948 legislation was replaced by the \"Citizenship Act 1977\", which came into force on 1 January 1978. This was substantially amended in 2005 by the \"Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2005\", in force from 21 April 2005.\n\nThe Citizenship Office of the Department of Internal Affairs is in charge of processing applications and enquiries relating to New Zealand citizenship.\n\nNew Zealand became a colony of the British Empire from the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. All New Zealanders, including Māori, were British subjects until 1948.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, all aliens (that is, non-British subjects) were able to enter and live freely in New Zealand. Property rights for aliens were restricted. French and German settlers complained about their inability to acquire property in New Zealand, and so, from 1844, aliens in New Zealand were able to become \"natural born subjects of Her Majesty [Queen Victoria]\" through proclamations by the governor (which would later be confirmed by ordinances).\n\nOn 1 January 1978, the Citizenship Act 1977 came into force. New Zealand passports no longer contained the phrase \"British subject and New Zealand citizen\", but instead only stated \"New Zealand citizen\". Foreign nationals who wanted to become New Zealand citizens were no longer \"naturalised\", but rather received New Zealand citizenship by \"grant\".\n\nFollowing the Second World War, the United Kingdom's relationship with its former colonies began to change. Self-governing members of the British Empire began to assert their independence. Canada passed its own citizenship act in 1946, creating Candian citizenship separate from that of British subjects, from 1 January 1947. In November 1947, New Zealand had reluctantly adopted the Statute of Westminster 1931 with the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947, but was at pains to stress its continued loyalty to Britain and the British Empire.\n\nFollowing the 1948 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in London where the future of nationality law within the Commonwealth was discussed, New Zealand's parliament passed the \"British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act 1948\" which established New Zealand citizenship, coming into force on 1 January 1949. The United Kingdom's own British Nationality Act 1948 came into force on 1 January 1949.\n\nDue to New Zealand's loyalty to the British Empire, New Zealand continued to use the term \"British Passport\" on passports issued to New Zealanders, even though legally the passports were issued by New Zealand under separate citizenship.\n\nMāori were granted \"all the Rights and Privileges of British Subjects\" under Article 3 of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. Their status as British subjects was re-affirmed by the Native Rights Act 1865. However, despite their legal status as British subjects, in practice, over the next century, Māori would be denied some of the privileges which white British subjects who moved to New Zealand from Britain enjoyed.\n\nWhen the Cook Islands and Niue became New Zealand territories in 1901, their inhabitants were already British subjects. In 1920, Tokelauans became recognised as British subjects.\n\nIn 1920, New Zealand started governing Western Samoa under a mandate from the League of Nations. The 1923 and 1928 British Nationality and Status of Aliens Acts passed by the Parliament of New Zealand allowed for Western Samoans to be naturalised as British subjects and they were exempted from the usual requirement to understand and speak English.\n\nWhen the British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act 1948 came into effect on 1 January 1949, Cook Islanders, Niueans, Tokelauans and Western Samoans who were British subjects gained New Zealand citizenship.\n\nWhen Western Samoa achieved independence from New Zealand in 1962, the citizenship status of Western Samoans living in New Zealand became uncertain. As a result, many Western Samoans were staying in New Zealand illegally.\n\nOn 28 July 1982, following a stiff tightening of Pacific Island immigration by the Muldoon government, the Privy Council ruled that because of the 1923 and 1928 British Nationality and Status of Aliens Acts, all Samoans born between 1924 and 1948 – and their children – were British subjects and hence, on 1 January 1949, had become New Zealand citizens.\n\nThe Privy Council ruling would have meant recognising over 100,000 Samoans as New Zealand citizens. Because the New Zealand Government was unwilling to grant New Zealand citizenship to such a large number of people, the Parliament of New Zealand passed the \"Citizenship (Western Samoa) Act 1982\" which overrode the Privy Council ruling. Under this new law, Samoan citizens who were in New Zealand at any point on 14 September 1982 (legally or illegally) or arrived in New Zealand as permanent residents after that date were eligible to be granted New Zealand citizenship, but other Samoans born before 1949 and their children were not.\n\nThis law has been controversial. A 2003 petition asking the Parliament of New Zealand to repeal the Act attracted 100,000 signatures, and the Samoan rights group Mau Sitiseni filed a petition on the issue with the United Nations Human Rights Committee in 2007.\n\nIn 1866, the Aliens Act imposed a naturalisation fee of £1 on all immigrants to New Zealand who were perceived to be 'undesirable', which in effect meant most non-white immigrants. When this naturalisation fee was abolished in the 1890s, Chinese people continued to be discriminated against as they still had to pay the fee whilst all other applicants did not.\n\nIn 1908, Chinese people in New Zealand were subjected to even more discrimination. They were denied any possibility for permanent residence and citizenship and were required to apply periodically for permission to remain in New Zealand. Despite being treated as third-class citizens, during the Second World War, Chinese people in New Zealand were forced to serve in the armed forces.\n\nIt was not until 1951 that Chinese people were finally allowed by law to apply for permanent residence and citizenship again. However, in practice, they continued to be subject to discrimination. Out of the first 400 applicants who fulfilled the legal requirements for New Zealand citizenship and hence who applied for naturalisation, only 20 applicants who were deemed to be 'the most highly assimilated [and educated] types' were approved. In addition, whilst all other applicants for New Zealand citizenship did not have to renounce their former nationality, Chinese people were required to renounce their Chinese citizenship and to demonstrate that they were 'closer to the New Zealand way of life than to the Chinese'.\n\nOn 12 February 2002, Prime Minister Helen Clark made a formal apology in Parliament to the Chinese community in New Zealand for the discrimination which they had faced in the past. In her speech, she acknowledged the 'unacceptable indignity' suffered by Chinese people in New Zealand as a result of 'discriminatory laws' passed by Parliament in the past relating to immigration and citizenship which applied to no other ethnic group.\n\nNew Zealand citizens enjoy the following rights (subject to certain exceptions):\n\nThe following responsibilities are expected of New Zealand citizens:\n\nBy virtue of the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement, New Zealand citizens are granted a Special Category Visa on arrival in Australia (which permits residence and work for an indefinite period) as long as they:\n\nAs Commonwealth citizens, New Zealanders are afforded a number of privileges in some Commonwealth countries.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, New Zealand citizens enjoy the following privileges:\n\nIn many Commonwealth countries in the Caribbean, such as Belize and Trinidad and Tobago, New Zealand citizens who are long-term residents have the right to vote in elections.\n\nNew Zealand citizens who require consular assistance in a foreign country where there is no New Zealand foreign mission may be able to request assistance from a British embassy, high commission or consulate. For example, New Zealanders who need to travel urgently and whose passport has expired, been lost or been stolen can be issued with an emergency travel document by a British foreign mission as long as this has cleared with the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.\n\nNew Zealand citizens travelling on a New Zealand passport enjoy the privilege of visa-free access to 172 countries and territories around the world, including the United States and all European Union member states according to the Henley visa restrictions index.\n\nIn recognition of the fact that foreign nationals (including Portuguese citizens) who are permanent residents are allowed to vote in elections in New Zealand, since 2013 Portugal has allowed New Zealand citizens aged 18 or over residing there to enrol at the \"Comissão Recenseadora\" and vote (though only in local elections). At present, New Zealand is the only country outside the European Union, the Community of Portuguese Language Countries and Latin America whose citizens are entitled to vote in Portugal.\n\nNew Zealand citizenship can be acquired in the following ways:\n\n\nFor the purpose of acquiring citizenship, the Cook Islands, Niue, the Ross Dependency and Tokelau are treated as part of New Zealand – hence, for example, a child born in Tokelau to a Tokelauan permanent resident would qualify for New Zealand citizenship. However, for Samoan citizens applying for a special grant of New Zealand citizenship, the Cook Islands, Niue, the Ross Dependency and Tokelau are not treated as part of New Zealand.\n\nNew Zealand citizenship was acquired on this date by British subjects falling into the following categories:\n\n\nFor the purpose of passing on New Zealand citizenship to children born outside New Zealand, all such persons are New Zealand citizens \"by descent\".\n\nSimilarly, all persons born or naturalised in New Zealand in 1949 or later are New Zealand citizens 'otherwise than by descent'.\n\nIn general, any person born in New Zealand (or on board a ship or aircraft registered in New Zealand) on or before 31 December 2005 is a New Zealand citizen by birth. The only exceptions are children who were born:\n\nChildren born in New Zealand (or on board a ship or aircraft registered in New Zealand) on or after 1 January 2006 will acquire New Zealand citizenship by birth only if at least one parent is a New Zealand citizen or entitled to be indefinitely in New Zealand (e.g. a resident or permanent resident, including Australian citizens). Children born to a parent who is a permanent resident of the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau also qualify.\n\nIf a person is not a New Zealand citizen by birth, but is subsequently adopted in New Zealand by an adoption order under the terms of the Adoption Act 1955 on or after 1 January 2006 by a person entitled to reside indefinitely in New Zealand (e.g. a New Zealand citizen or resident or permanent resident, an Australian citizen or permanent resident), the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau), the person becomes a New Zealand citizen. The post-adoptive birth register entry will record that the person is a New Zealand citizen.\n\nThe following people are also New Zealand citizens by birth:\n\nA person who is a New Zealand citizen by birth is a New Zealand \"otherwise than by descent\", which means that they can pass New Zealand citizenship on to their children born overseas.\n\nThe following persons born or adopted \"outside\" New Zealand qualify to become New Zealand citizens by descent:\nIn order to claim their New Zealand citizenship, these people must register their citizenship by descent at the Citizenship Office.\n\nA person born or adopted outside New Zealand between 1949 and 1977 with a mother who is a New Zealand citizen otherwise than by descent at the time of birth or the final adoption order is entitled to apply for a grant of New Zealand citizenship \"as of right\" (see below), rather than New Zealand citizenship by descent.\n\nA person born to or adopted by a parent \"outside\" New Zealand who, at the time of birth or the final adoption order, was a New Zealand citizen (by descent or otherwise than by descent) working overseas for the public service or Armed Forces of New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau is considered to be a New Zealand citizen \"otherwise than by descent\", rather than by descent.\n\nIf the child of a New Zealand citizen by descent born or adopted overseas does not qualify to register as a New Zealand citizen, they can be brought to live in New Zealand and subsequently granted New Zealand citizenship (see below).\n\nNew Zealand citizens by descent may apply for a grant of New Zealand citizenship (see below) after meeting the requirements. Upon this point, they become New Zealand citizens \"otherwise than by descent\" and can then pass on New Zealand citizenship to children born outside New Zealand.\n\nTo receive a grant of New Zealand citizenship, a person must either fulfil the general requirements or qualify for a special grant (e.g. as the child of a New Zealand citizen or as a qualifying Samoan citizen).\n\nA person granted New Zealand citizenship must usually attend a citizenship ceremony, unless they are under the age of 14, already a New Zealand citizen by descent or granted citizenship on the basis of birth outside New Zealand to a New Zealand citizen mother. These ceremonies are conducted by local city and district councils at regular intervals, although some new citizens choose to attend a special ceremony, such as those which occur on Waitangi Day (New Zealand's national day, 6 February). At the ceremony, the person must make the oath of allegiance for new citizens before the city or district's mayor (or another presiding officer), unless the Minister of Internal Affairs has waived this requirement.\n\nA person who receives a grant of New Zealand citizenship is a New Zealand citizen \"otherwise than by descent\", and so they can pass on New Zealand citizenship to their children born overseas.\n\nA person (including a New Zealand citizen by descent) can apply for a general grant of New Zealand citizenship if they fulfil the following criteria:\n\n\nTo fulfil the residence requirement, an applicant for a grant of New Zealand citizenship must have been physically present and permanently resident in New Zealand during the 5 years preceding the date of application (time spent in New Zealand before the 5-year period is not relevant). A person who has been in New Zealand without a visa/permit during their residence period does not meet the requirements because \"unlawful residence\" is precluded in the Citizenship Act 1977. To fulfil the 5-year residence requirement, a person must have been physically present in New Zealand:\n\nThe Minister of Internal Affairs may use their discretion to reduce the residence requirement in exceptional circumstances to:\n\nTime spent outside New Zealand in Crown service under the New Zealand Government (or as the spouse, civil union or de facto partner of a New Zealand citizen in Crown service under the New Zealand Government overseas) may be considered as time spent in New Zealand. Similarly, time spent overseas in the public service of the Government of the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau (or as the spouse, civil union or de facto partner who was a New Zealand citizen serving overseas in the public service of Government of the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau) can count as time spent in New Zealand.\n\nPreviously, for applications before 21 April 2010, those present in New Zealand as permanent residents before 21 April 2005, or those who applied successfully for permanent residence before that date, were able to apply for New Zealand citizenship after three years of \"ordinary residence\" (this provision expired on 1 January 2010).\n\nSamoan citizens can apply for a special grant of New Zealand citizenship if:\nSamoan citizens do not need to meet the residence, intention, character, language and knowledge requirements that a person would generally need to fulfil to qualify for a grant of New Zealand citizenship.\n\nWhilst the Citizenship Act 1977 defines 'New Zealand' as New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Niue, the Ross Dependency and Tokelau, the Citizenship (Western Samoa) Act 1982 defines 'New Zealand' to mean New Zealand only. Therefore, to apply for a special grant of New Zealand citizenship for Samoans, presence or indefinite immigration status in the Cook Islands, Niue, Ross Dependency and Tokelau does not count as presence or indefinite immigration status in New Zealand.\n\nA person can receive a special grant of New Zealand citizenship if they fulfil all of the following criteria:\n\nAlternatively, a child under the age of 16 at the time the Minister of Internal Affairs makes a decision can receive a special grant of New Zealand citizenship if they fulfil all of the following criteria:\n\nAdditionally, persons born outside New Zealand to or adopted by a mother who was a New Zealand citizen \"otherwise than by descent\" on or after 1 January 1949 and on or before 31 December 1977 are \"entitled\" to be granted New Zealand citizenship (i.e. the Minister of Internal Affairs cannot refuse the application of a person who qualifies for a grant of New Zealand citizenship in this way).\n\nThe Minister of Internal Affairs has the discretion to grant New Zealand citizenship to a person who would otherwise be stateless.\n\nThe Minister of Internal Affairs has the discretion to grant New Zealand citizenship to any person in exceptional circumstances where to do so would be in the public interest.\n\nNew Zealand has permitted dual or multiple citizenship since the creation of New Zealand citizenship on 1 January 1949, although dual citizens who actively acquired or exercised their other citizenship could lose their New Zealand citizenship if their continued citizenship was judged \"not conducive to the public good\". The modern wording is similar; dual citizens may lose New Zealand citizenship by acting \"in a manner that is contrary to the interests of New Zealand\". A New Zealand citizen who holds another citizenship may renounce their New Zealand citizenship (see below), although this may not be registered if they reside in New Zealand or the country is at war.\n\nNew Zealand citizenship was granted only to British subjects (exceptions could be made for married women and minors); therefore, New Zealanders who lost British subject status before 1949 were not necessarily entitled to automatic New Zealand citizenship and so would have been required to apply for naturalisation. \n\nIn 2017, dual citizenship with New Zealand proved problematic for multiple Australian politicians, who are ineligible to run for parliament with allegiance to a foreign power under s44(i) of the Australian Constitution. These include New Zealand-born Greens Senator Scott Ludlam, who resigned after discovering that he had not lost his dual citizenship by naturalising in Australia, as well as Deputy Prime Minister and Nationals Leader Barnaby Joyce. His father was born in New Zealand as a British Subject and emigrated to Australia. Living in Australia as a British Subject, he was granted New Zealand citizenship when it was created, thus retrospectively making him a NZ citizen from birth. This subsequently made Joyce a citizen by descent.\n\nA person can only renounce their New Zealand citizenship if they fulfil all of the following criteria:\n\nThe Minister of Internal Affairs \"may\" refuse to register the renunciation of New Zealand citizenship of a person if they are living in New Zealand or if a state of war exists between New Zealand and another country. The general practice is that if a New Zealand citizen is in New Zealand at the time of applying to renounce their citizenship, the Minister of Internal Affairs will only register the renunciation if the person would continue to reside in New Zealand lawfully following the renunciation (e.g. if they are also an Australian citizen or has a residence permit) or if the person will leave New Zealand permanently following the registration of the renunciation.\n\nA person may become caught in a 'catch-22' situation: if they want to become a citizen of their new country, but cannot until they have renounced their existing citizenship, they are unable to renounce their New Zealand citizenship and the Minister of Internal Affairs will not register the renunciation of their New Zealand citizenship, because the law specifies that a person must \"already\" have the citizenship of at least one other country at the time of applying for renunciation of New Zealand citizenship. Therefore, for example, an individual who only has New Zealand citizenship will never be able to apply for Singaporean citizenship because once her Singaporean citizenship application has been approved, she must first renounce her existing nationality \"before\" she can attend a Singaporean citizenship ceremony and officially obtain Singaporean nationality.\n\nA register of people who have renounced or have been deprived of New Zealand citizenship is kept by the Citizenship Office and any person is allowed to view it.\n\nThe Minister of Internal Affairs can revoke a person's New Zealand citizenship if:\n\nThe nationality laws of Israel, Canada, the US (e.g. see List of denaturalized former citizens of the United States), UK and Spain have provisions to take away the locally acquired citizenship if it was obtained under a process similar to the one mentioned above for NZ nationality acquired via naturalization.\n\nA New Zealand citizen by birth does not lose their citizenship by being adopted by a foreign parent/parents.\n\nIn 2011, 19,279 people from 185 countries obtained New Zealand citizenship by grant.\n\nBetween 1970 and 2011, the top 10 previous citizenships of people who obtained New Zealand citizenship by grant were (in order starting from the most): the United Kingdom, China (including Hong Kong and Macao), Samoa, India, South Africa, Fiji, Taiwan, Korea (North and South), the Philippines and Sri Lanka.\n\nPrior to 1 January 1978, New Zealand citizenship law had different rules.\n\n\n\n"}

That's not typically the first thing that comes to mind when you look at me, I don't think. But when I put on that wig – luckily they didn't dye my hair – and change my physicality a lot... Nothing against brunettes – I still felt beautiful. But I felt a lot less inhibited, and I felt down to be a little more brash and powerful and strong. I kind of hid behind all this brown hair, and it gave me the power and confidence to verbally rip this one over here. [Laughs.]\" Her portrayal as Clarisse was met with mostly positive reviews.

The station has broadcast continuously at 88.1 MHz on the FM radio band (with rare interruptions due to power loss or other technical failures) since 1988 without automation. \n\nWRFL is operated at all times by volunteer deejays, consisting largely of University of Kentucky students and also of some Lexington community members. A large portion of its programming is left up to the deejays, who plan their own shows in either a general or genre-specific format. Music played on WRFL is strictly \"alternative,\" here defined as material which cannot be heard on other radio stations or through traditional, commercial outlets. This requirement is not only part of the station's culture and character, but is also mandated by the station's educational U.S. Federal Communications Commission license.\n\nWRFL also has a commitment to public affairs and the community, featuring student-produced news programs, student-produced sports programs, and broadcasting the syndicated progressive news program \"Democracy Now!\" five days a week.\n\nThe station has a strong connection with the Lexington music scene and highlights underground and local artists weekly through its live music program, WRFL-Live, as well as on many of its other shows.\n\nThe Gavin Report listed WRFL in the top 2% of college radio stations in the nation.\n\nCurrent slogans of the station include \"All the way to the left,\" and \"The only alternative left.\"\n\nBroadcasting began in 1988 using a 250-watt tower. In 2007, the FCC approved the station for an upgrade to 7,900 watts, which increased its terrestrial broadcast considerably (former propagation, current propagation). To finance the cost of a new tower and transmitter, the station ran a fund raising campaign titled, \"Build the Tower, Boost the Power\". In May 2010, the old 250-watt tower was dismantled and the new 7900-watt tower was installed in its place.\n\nThe station has ties to the noise music community as several of its current and former DJs are members of bands such as Hair Police and Wolf Eyes. The station is thanked in the liner notes of recent Apples in Stereo albums, and has ties to the Elephant Six Collective.\n\nWRFL has used many slogans throughout its history, many of which allude to its broadcast frequency on the leftmost portion of the dial and its unofficial social and political tendencies. Examples include:\n\n\nThe RiFLe (originally named RiFLe Comix) is the triannual zine of WRFL. The first magazine predated WRFL's terrestrial broadcast in 1987 and is an integral part of the station's tradition. \n\n"}

{"id": "2316869", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316869", "title": "Cherokee Hair Tampons", "text": "Cherokee Hair Tampons\n\n\"Cherokee Hair Tampons\" is the sixth episode of the fourth season of the animated television series \"South Park\", and the 55th episode of the series overall. \"Cherokee Hair Tampons\" originally aired in the United States on June 28, 2000 on Comedy Central.\n\nIn the episode, Kyle needs a kidney transplant, and Cartman is discovered to be a perfect donor. Cartman gladly offers his kidney to Kyle, for the price of $10 million. Stan, worried about the inevitable loss of his best friend, decides to take matters into his own hands and get Cartman's kidney to save Kyle's life.\n\nThe episode begins with a substitute teacher coming in to teach the 3rd grade class. The boys mess around with the teacher at roll call, with Stan pretending that he is Cartman, Kenny pretending he is Stan, and Cartman pretending he is Kenny. Cartman laughs so hard that milk squirts out of his nose (despite the fact that he was not drinking any); this gag continues through the episode whenever he laughs. The teacher gives them all an assignment to make a get-well-soon card for Kyle, and Butters literally ends up being the card. Stan visits his sick friend, who is, according to his mother, suffering from kidney failure due to diabetes and needs a transplant. Since they are unable to find a donor and Sheila is worried about the risks of having Kyle undergo surgery, Sharon suggests to Sheila that she try New Age healing to cure Kyle. They visit the holistic medicine store of a newly arrived shopkeeper named Miss Information, who tells them that mysterious \"toxins\" are the cause of Kyle's ailments and prescribes a series of herbs to help him; they do not help, but she convinces the people of South Park that they are healing him even though it is not visible. The whole town becomes enamored with her remedies and buys such nostrums as \"Cherokee hair tampons\" from two supposed Native Americans (played by Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong) who share her store. Before long, everyone is so hooked on \"holistic medicine\" that Miss Information can get away with selling coat hangers as \"dream catchers\" for very high prices.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Garrison is fired for his incompetence as a third grade teacher and for charges of soliciting sex from a minor. He decides to fulfill his dream of publishing a book and begins to write a romance novel, in which he manages to use the word \"penis\" 6,083 times.\n\nStan goes to ask Dr. Doctor for help, and the doctor says that Kyle will die unless he gets a kidney transplant from the only other person in town with a compatible blood type: Cartman. Stan tries to convince everyone that the New Age so-called \"healing\" is not working and that only a kidney transplant can cure Kyle, but Miss Information insists that the doctor is only interested in making money from the procedure, even as she herself charges exorbitant prices for her holistic healing items. Stan tries to convince Cartman to donate his organ, and Cartman refuses to do it unless he gets $10 million in exchange. Upset at Cartman's callousness, Stan tries to get his other friends to help him take Cartman's kidney by force. However, only Kenny, Butters, and Timmy show up; when Stan expresses disappointment, Butters mentions Clyde would have come too, had there not been tacos for dinner. An attempt to sneak into Cartman's house and cut his kidney out while he sleeps proves fruitless, as he wears a \"Kidney Blocker 2000\". Resigned, Stan laments to Kenny over Kyle's imminent death at the hands of holistic medicine, but Kenny, furious at Stan for disregarding the fact that Kenny had died in almost every episode up until then, says one of Cartman's catchphrases, \"Screw you guys, I'm going home.\" then walks off, only to be crushed by a falling piano; Stan does not notice as he was busy crying. Mrs. Broflovski brings a very weak and gravely ill Kyle in for a \"spiritual healing\" by Miss Information's \"Native Americans\". To the shock of the citizens, the \"Native Americans\" take one look at Kyle and declare that he is in need of a doctor and they are actually Mexicans. The two \"Native Americans\" explain to the townsfolk that Miss Information is a fraud who convinced everyone that they were Native Americans and that they had simply neglected to set the record straight. Angered about being scammed, the townsfolk attack and beat Miss Information to death, and Stan declares that he has a plan to get Kyle a kidney.\n\nCartman awakens the next day to find the Kidney Blocker 2000 destroyed and blood all over his bed. Infuriated, he marches to Stan's house and recovers his kidney, then goes to the doctor and arranges to have it put back in, but not before signing a release form. However, it was all a ruse—part of Stan's plan. Cartman's mom had opened the Blocker and spread ketchup on his bed to fool him. The form he signed was fraud in the factum and actually allowed Kyle to take his kidney; the kidney that Stan had given him was fake. Cartman is angered, Kyle is better, and Mr. Garrison - now a best-selling author - comes to give him a signed copy of his book, \"In the Valley of Penises\". Cartman is still enraged as Kyle and Stan laugh at him until milk comes out of Kyle's nose. Cartman expresses relief that Kyle got his \"crappy kidney\".\n\nThe Cherokee woman in the live-action commercial was played by \"South Park\" audio editor Lydia Quidilla. In an interview, Quidilla stated that she received her first piece of hate mail for the episode. Richard \"Cheech\" Marin and Tommy Chong, from the comedy duo Cheech & Chong, played the two fake Native Americans. The episode served as a partial reunion of the two, although their voices were recorded separately: Chong recorded his lines at the South Park Studios, whereas Marin recorded his in San Francisco.\n\nThe live action segment was rated one of the \"Best Live-Action South Park Commercials\" by the \"Huffington Post\".\n\n"}

He also formerly served as the head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nA former point guard, Lue played college basketball for the Nebraska Cornhuskers before being selected by the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the 1998 NBA draft with the 23rd overall pick. He was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers shortly thereafter. As a member of the Lakers, Lue won two NBA championships in his first three seasons.\n\nAfter his playing career ended in 2009, Lue became Director of Basketball Development for the Boston Celtics. In 2014, he was hired by the Cavaliers as associate head coach. Lue was promoted to head coach during the 2015–16 season, replacing the fired David Blatt. That same season, Lue coached the Cavaliers to their first-ever NBA championship and became one of the few rookie coaches in the NBA to ever lead his team to a title. Lue coached the Cavaliers to the NBA Finals in the 2016–17 and 2017–18 seasons; in both seasons, the Cavaliers were defeated by the Golden State Warriors. Lue was fired by Cleveland in October 2018.\n\nLue graduated from Raytown Senior High School in Raytown, Missouri. He later attended the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, where he played basketball and studied sociology. Lue was a key member of the 1995-96 team that won the NIT, defeating St. Joseph's in the finals. He finished his Cornhuskers career ranked third all-time in assists (432), fourth in three-pointers made (145) and attempted (407), fifth in steals (154) and seventh in scoring (1,577). Lue led Nebraska in assists in each of his three seasons and finished his career tied with Dave Hoppen for most games with 30 or more points (7). He declared for the NBA draft after his junior season.\n\nLue opted for early entry into the 1998 NBA draft. He was selected 23rd overall by the Denver Nuggets but was traded on draft night to the Los Angeles Lakers with Tony Battie in exchange for Nick Van Exel. His first three years with the Lakers were disappointing. His playing time was limited and he suffered from injuries in 2000. But Lue excelled in the 2001 playoffs. Due to his quickness, he was specifically used to guard Allen Iverson during Game 1 of the Finals.\n\nIn the off-season of 2001, Lue signed with the Washington Wizards, where he got considerably more playing time and subsequently became a better point guard. He played with the Orlando Magic in 2003–04 and had a lot of minutes alongside Tracy McGrady, but the team had the worst record in the NBA that season: 21–61. After the season concluded, Lue, McGrady, Juwan Howard, and Reece Gaines were traded to the Houston Rockets for Steve Francis, Cuttino Mobley and Kelvin Cato. In Houston, Lue saw a notable decrease in playing time due to the overabundance of point guards on the Rockets' roster, and was subsequently traded mid-season to the Atlanta Hawks for Jon Barry. Lue starred in Atlanta, although again his team had the worst record in the NBA and their worst record in franchise history: 13–69.\n\nOn February 16, 2008, Lue was acquired by the Sacramento Kings in a trade with the Hawks. He was waived by the Kings on February 28, 2008. After clearing waivers, Lue signed a contract with the Dallas Mavericks on March 4.\n\nOn July 17, 2008, Lue was signed by the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nOn February 5, 2009, Lue was traded back to the Magic in exchange for Keith Bogans and cash considerations. In his final year as an NBA player, the Dwight Howard-led Magic advanced to the 2009 Finals but lost to Lue's former team, the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nOn October 23, 2009, the Boston Celtics named Lue director of basketball development. In July 2013, he joined the Los Angeles Clippers' coaching staff. On June 23, 2014, Lue joined the Cleveland Cavaliers as associate head coach, becoming the highest-paid assistant coach in the NBA. Lue had been a top candidate for the Cavs' head coaching job, which eventually went to David Blatt.\n\nOn January 22, 2016, Lue was named head coach of the Cavaliers immediately following the mid-season firing of Blatt. He was signed to a three-year contract. Lue coached the Cavs to an NBA championship that spring. In May, the Cavaliers defeated the Toronto Raptors in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals, continuing their unbeaten streak in the 2016 playoffs and making Lue the first coach in NBA history to win his first 10 postseason games. Eight days later, Lue led the Cavaliers to the NBA Finals, becoming one of the few coaches to reach the Finals after becoming head coach in midseason. On June 19, 2016, the Cavaliers won their first-ever NBA Championship. Lue became the second rookie head coach in two years to win the title, the third head coach (along with Paul Westhead in 1979–80 and Pat Riley in 1981–82) to win a championship after becoming head coach in midseason, and the 14th person to have won an NBA championship as a head coach and as a player.\n\nIn the 2016–17 NBA season, Lue coached the Cavaliers to a 51–31 record. In the playoffs, the Cavaliers went 12–1 heading into the 2017 NBA Finals before losing to the Golden State Warriors in five games.\n\nOn March 19, 2018, Lue announced that he would take a leave of absence from coaching the Cavaliers, citing recurrent chest pain. Lue returned to coach before the regular season ended and helped the Cavaliers reach the 2018 NBA Finals, where they lost to the Warriors in four games.\n\nLue's coaching style in Cleveland relied on flexibility and LeBron James's consistency; he shuffled players around James to adjust to matchups. In 2016, his Finals team followed the Warriors' own blueprint to beat them. Lue's style was described as undisciplined and unprepared in the regular season, but in the playoffs, he has been praised for his ability to \"think several moves ahead and create matchup advantages\". At the 2016 ESPY Awards, Lue was named Best Coach/Manager and the Cavs were named Best Team.\n\nOn October 28, 2018, the Cavaliers fired Lue after a 0–6 start of the season. Afterwards, Lue worked in an informal role with head coach Doc Rivers of the Los Angeles Clippers. Prior to the 2019–20 season, Lue was named the lead assistant coach on Rivers' staff.\n\n! align=\"center\" colspan=2|Career\n! 211||128||83|||| ||61||41||20||||\nAs player:\n\nAs coach:\n\nLue is a first cousin once removed of NBA small forward Jayson Tatum.

Water from the southern slope flows underground until it emerges some miles away in the Shannon Pot, the traditional source of the River Shannon. The area is sometimes referred to as the Cuilcagh Mountains.\n\nThe name Cuilcagh comes from the Irish \"Cuilceach\", which has been translated as \"chalky\". However, the mountain is mainly sandstone and shale, covered with bog and heather. The cliff-edged summit surface of the mountain is formed from the hard-wearing Lackagh Sandstone which itself overlies the Briscloonagh Sandstone. \"It is possible that the name refers to the limestone rock on the lower northern flanks, namely the Glencar and Dartry Limestone formations. Here a number of streams disappear below ground at swallow holes named Cats Hole, Pollawaddy, Pollasumera and Polliniska, all forming part of the Marble Arch cave system. If so, the name would mean 'calcareous' rather than 'chalky'\". It has also been called Slieve Cuilcagh in English, 'Slieve' being an anglicisation of \"Sliabh\" (\"mountain\").\n\nIn the 1609 Plantation of Ulster, Cuilcagh formed part of lands which were granted to John Sandford of Castle Doe by letters patent dated 7 July 1613 (Pat. 11 James I – LXXI – 38, Quilkagh). It was later sold by Sandford to his wife's uncle Toby Caulfeild, 1st Baron Caulfeild, Master of the Ordnance and Caulfield had the sale confirmed by letters patent of 12 July 1620 (Pat. 19 James I. XI. 45, Quilkagh).\n\nCuilcagh Mountain has one of the largest expanses of blanket bog in Northern Ireland, on a relatively high elevation upland landscape, bounded by limestone grassland to the north and montane habitats to the south. The blanket bog exhibits a wide range of characteristic vegetation and structural features, with well-developed pool, hummock and lawn features, acid flushes and bog\nbursts. The bog vegetation is characterised by luxuriant Sphagnum mosses but over most of the site dwarf-shrubs and graminoid herbaceous species dominate. The Cuilcagh area supports a rich assemblage of upland insects, and is one of the most important sites in Ireland for these species. Species recorded include the water beetles \"Agabus melanarius\", \"Agabus arcticus\", \"Dytiscus lapponicus\", \"Stictotarsus multilineatus\", \"Hydroporus longicornis\" and \"Hydroporus morio\" and the water bugs \"Glaenocorisa propinqua\" and \"Callicorixa wollastoni\". Lough Atona is the main locality for these species.\n\nThe Cuilcagh Mountain Park was opened by Fermanagh District Council in 1998.\n\nThe Cuilcagh Mountain Ramsar site (wetlands of international importance designated under the Ramsar Convention), is 2744.45 hectares in area, at latitude 54 13 26 N and longitude 07 48 17 W. It was designated a Ramsar site on 31 December 1998. The site qualified under Criterion 1 of the Ramsar Convention because is a large and relatively intact example of a blanket bog and one of the best examples of this habitat in the United Kingdom. It also contains a comparatively high-altitude example of an oligotrophic lake, Lough Atona. The site also qualified under Criterion 2 because it supports numbers of rare, vulnerable or endangered species. It is one of the most important upland breeding sites in Northern Ireland for Eurasian golden plover, an Irish Red Data Book species. The merlin, which is also an Irish Red Data Book species, occurs on the site too. The bog is also occasionally used for feeding by greater white-fronted geese.\n\nIn 2001 the Cuilcagh Mountain Park was joined with popular tourist attraction the Marble Arch Caves and the Cladagh Glen Nature Reserve to make one of the first UNESCO-recognised European Geoparks. This became a Global Geopark in 2004. In September 2008 the Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark was expanded into County Cavan, making it the world's first transnational cross-border Geopark. The Geopark is protected and managed by Fermanagh & Omagh District Council through the staff of the Marble Arch Caves Visitor Centre.\n\nIn 2015, the Cuilcagh Boardwalk Trail or Cuilcagh Legnabrocky Trail (and also called \"The Stairway to Heaven\") was opened up to preserve and protect the underlying peatland bog from erosion; however the trail led to a dramatic rise in visitors to Cuilcagh from circa 3,000 per annum to over 60,000.\n\nThe wooden trail is 7.5 kilometers long and is part of the longer Legnabrocky trail. The popularity of the trail has led to concerns over the ability of the area to handle the increased visitors to the trail.\n\n\n"}

Tom Conrad, formerly of Chicago local band 5o4plan, replaced LaTrace as the second guitarist/backing vocalist and Andy Mrotek, formerly of Last Place Champs, replaced DelPrincipe as the drummer. Andy Mrotek and Thomas Conrad are listed in the liner notes, but were added to the band after the recording of Almost Here to replace DelPrincipe and LaTrace, respectively.\n\nIn January and February 2005, the band toured across the U.S. alongside Something Corporate, Hidden in Plain View, Straylight Run, and Armor for Sleep. \"Almost Here\" was released on February 8 through Fueled by Ramen. In mid-June, a music video for \"Checkmarks\" premiered on Fuse's \"Oven Fresh\" programme. Between-mid June and mid-August, the group went on the 2005 edition of Warped Tour. In January 2006, the band went on a sold-out UK tour with Panic! at the Disco. In February and March, the group went on the Truckstops and Statelines tour, alongside Panic! at the Disco, Acceptance and Hellogoodbye. On February 21, the band released an acoustic EP, titled \"From the Carpet\", which included three songs from \"Almost Here\": \"The Phrase That Pays\", \"Down and Out\" and \"Black Mamba\". The band went on the 2006 edition of the Warped Tour.\n\nThe album spawned three singles: \"Checkmarks\", \"Slow Down\" (often incorrectly referred to as \"Hollywood Hills\"), which was chosen through an online poll on the band's website, and \"The Phrase That Pays\". \"Classifieds\" was an intended single from the album and a video was made for the song. For unknown reasons, this video was never released, but the video's director posted it on YouTube.\n\nThe album debuted at #20 on the \"Billboard\" Top Heatseekers chart, as well as at #24 on the \"Billboard\" Independent Albums chart. It also charted at #185 on The Billboard Top 200 Albums Chart. By May 2006, the album had sold over 144,000 copies. By October 2009, the album's sales stood at 265,000.\n\nBuzzFeed included the album at number 33 on their \"36 Pop Punk Albums You Need To Hear Before You F——ing Die\" list.\n\nOn February 6, 2010, The Academy Is... performed a 5th Anniversary Show for the album with Sing It Loud and special guest.\n\nOn September 12, 2015, rumors were confirmed that the band would embark on a 10th Anniversary show for Riot Fest in Chicago. Following the announcement of the Riot Fest reunion show, the band released dates for the 10th Anniversary U.S. tour.\n\nAdapted credits from the \"Almost Here\" liner notes.\n\n\n\nAlbum\nCitations\nSources\n\n"}
{"id": "2316920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316920", "title": "IAUDIO", "text": "IAUDIO\n\niAUDIO is the brand name for a range of portable media players produced by Korean consumer electronics and software corporation Cowon Systems, Inc. iAUDIO products are best known for their high sound quality, wide file format support and long battery life.\n\nThe iAUDIO range consists of players based on both flash memory and hard disk drives. Flash memory-based players are available with a capacity of up to 32 GB, while the hard drive-based models currently have capacities up to 160 GB. The iAUDIO 6 was the first player to use Toshiba's new 4GB 0.85″ hard disk.\n\nCowon entered the digital audio player market in October 2000 with the introduction of their first MP3 player, the iAUDIO CW100. In March 2001, the iAUDIO CW100s, a revised model, was released.\n\nIn December 2001, Cowon released the iAUDIO CW200. The CW200 had audio playback capabilities, an FM radio and voice recording through a built-in microphone. This player also had a revised model, the iAUDIO CW250.\n\nIn December 2002, Cowon released the iAUDIO CW300. This model was essentially an iAUDIO CW200 using AA batteries as a power supply. Most reviewers also regarded it as having a higher build quality.\n\nThe iAUDIO 4 was introduced December 2003. It came with most of the features that users of the CW200 and CW300 had been missing.\nUpgrades from previous players came in the form of UMS standard, BBE sound processing effects, line in recording and a 124 colour backlight LED display. This player used the STMP 3420 chipset by Sigmatel.\n\nThe iAUDIO M3 was introduced March 2004. The player was Cowon's first DAP with an integrated 1.8-inch (46 mm) hard drive. When the M3 was released there was a lot of controversy about it, because the actual unit had no display. All but a few basic functions had to be controlled via the included remote control. Some people liked this concept, others were not so fond of it.\n\nWhen the iAUDIO M3 was first released outside of Korea, there was a quality issue with the player's remote control. There was a widespread \"fading\" issue, in which the text of the remote slowly disappeared. This issue was rectified by the rapid recall of all faulty remotes and free replacements.\n\nThe iAUDIO U2 was introduced in July 2004. It was also Cowon's first player to feature a navigational joystick instead of the 2 rockers found on most previous releases. The U2 used the STMP 3520 chipset by Sigmatel.\n\nThe iAUDIO G3 was introduced November 2004. The internal hardware was very similar to that of the iAUDIO U2. Both players used the same Sigmatel chipset. The only difference between the two players was that the G3 was powered by an AA battery, allowing a playing time of up to 50 hours.\n\nThe iAUDIO G2 was a cheaper version of the G3 which was introduced in the spring of 2005. It lacked some of the main features of the G3: no FM radio, the interface was only USB 1.1 (compared to USB 2.0 on the G3), and the playback time with a single AA battery was down to 40 hours.\n\nThe iAUDIO 5 was introduced in December 2004. It was the successor to the popular iAUDIO 4 series and was powered by the same Sigmatel chipset that were used in the iAUDIO U2 and G3. The iAUDIO 5 was relatively similar to the aforementioned players. What set it apart from other players was the fact that it had 1000 different backlight colour combinations. It was powered by an AAA battery which allowed for a maximum playback time of up to 20 hours.\n\nThe iAUDIO X5 was released in April 2005.\n\nThe X5 uses much of the same hardware as the M3, and as such has much of the same features and capabilities. It has almost identical features to the iriver H300 Series. The X5 includes a color screen on the unit.\n\nAs with the M3, there is an \"L\" version which is 4 mm thicker and has a longer battery life. Unlike the M3, the X5 comes in 20, 30, and 60 GB variants. It is likely that there will be no 60 GB X5L, as the 60 GB X5 itself is the thickness of the 20 and 30 GB X5L due to the increased size of the hard drive. The 20, 30, and 60 GB capacities offer a rated battery life of 14 hours for audio playback with a 950 mAh battery. The 20 and 30 GB X5L models specify a rated playback time of 35 hours with a 2250 mAh battery. Video battery life is unspecified. In addition to the \"L\" versions, the X5 also comes in a \"V\" variation, which lacks the FM radio.\n\nCowon announced in May 2007 that the X5 series had been discontinued. Its successor, the X7 series, was slated to be released at some point in the summer of 2007, but was delayed until October 2010.\n\nThe iAUDIO M5 is basically a simplified version of the X5. It lacks an FM Radio, a colour screen (it has a greyscale screen instead), and USB-OTG functionality to save production costs. Its casing is a silver color instead of the black X5. There's also an \"L\" version available, which features enhanced battery life. The \"L\" version of the player is a little thicker and heavier though and costs slightly more.\n\nIntroduced in July 2005, the iAUDIO F1 can be described as an iAUDIO U2 with an interesting design, a colour OLED display, and higher power output (32 mW vs. 20 mW for the U2).\n\nThis player was and still is a favorite subject of ridicule among iAUDIO fans. The player's design was supposed to represent that of a Formula 1 sports car, which some criticize for making the F1 look more like a toy than a serious piece of portable audio equipment.\n\nThe F1 played Vorbis, WMA, WAV, ASF and MP3 files and could tune to the radio, as well as record from the radio. It could also record directly from sources or record using a built in microphone.\n\nIt came in 256 MB/512 MB/1 GB sizes of Flash memory.\n\nIntroduced in October 2005, the iAUDIO U3 was the successor to the iAUDIO U2. The main difference between the two players was that the U3 featured a color screen (260,000 colors, 160×128 resolution) which allowed playback of MPEG4 videos encoded in XviD, as well as picture display. Like the iAUDIO X5, the U3 only played video files at up to 15 frame/s with a resolution of 160x128. Most videos must therefore be converted to be played back on the U3 using the provided software from Cowon. The player can also display JPEG and TXT files. The support for audio files was also enhanced from previous models: the U3 was the world's first Flash-based player that was able to play FLAC files (but only from compression rate 0 to 2 with the initial Firmware v1.11. It now supports up to Q8 with V1.13). Another new feature was the U3's powerful sound output of 30 mW per channel (at 16 ohm, achieved by utilizing the new Telechip TCC770 audio chipset and Cirrus Logic CS42L51 Codec). Like the U2 the U3 had a built-in lithium polymer cell for a playback time of up to 20 hours. As with all iAUDIO devices, there was no need for the use of software, since the U3 was a UMS device (though additional software was required to take advantage of some features, such as converting video to the right format to be played back on the player).\n\nWith the firmware version 1.20 Cowon added ID3 browsing and DRM capabilities to the U3. This made the U3 the first iAUDIO player that allowed the user to browse its contents by the contents of ID3 tags embedded in the files.\n\nFeatures:\n\nThe iAUDIO was presented in January 2006 at the CES in Las Vegas. It was the first digital audio player to feature a 0.85-inch (22 mm) hard drive. This technology allowed the production of a high capacity digital audio player in a very small form factor.\n\nIn August 2006, Cowon released the iAUDIO T2. The T2 was a necklace type audio player. It featured a color screen, though it did not support video or photo viewing. Features included FM radio, voice recording and Cowon's traditional wide codec support: the T2 supported MP3, WMA, Ogg, and WAV audio files.\n\nFLAC was supported up to firmware 1.20, but not by later versions. Firmware 1.20 is no longer available for download from Cowon.\n\nIn September 2006, Cowon released the iAUDIO F2. The F2, with a design similar to a mobile phone, was the successor to the F1, and very similar to the U3 in features. Instead of the F1's OLED display, it featured a color LCD display. Apart from FM radio, voice recording and line-in recording, it also featured video playback as well as photo and text viewing.\n\nIn June 2007, Cowon announced the iAUDIO 7, a player based on the iAUDIO 6 but with 4, 8, or 16 gigabytes of flash memory instead of a hard drive. The OLED screen from the iAUDIO 6 model was replaced by a TFT with 260,000 colors (18 bit colour depth). The device used a swing-control. Audio recordings could only be saved in WMA format, with a user selectable bitrate of 64, 80, 96, or 128 kbit/s. The device played MP3, WMA, FLAC, Ogg Vorbis, WAV, and ASF audio files as well as Xvid videos. The frame rate of video playback was limited to 15 frames per second. It was produced in Korea.\n\nUnlike its predecessor, the iAUDIO 6, the iAUDIO 7 had no USB host (USB On-the-Go) capabilities.\n\nIn August 2007, Cowon announced the iAUDIO U5 at IFA 2007. The U5 featured Windows DRM10 support as well as MP3 and WAV (Ogg and FLAC supported with updated US firmware v3.16). There was no support for video. The U5 came in 4 and 8 GB versions with a LCD with 128×160 resolution and 65 000 colors. The U5 had a 24-hour continuous audio playback time.\n\nThe iAUDIO E2 was released in November 2009.\n\nThe iAUDIO 10 was released in South Korea in September 2011, with a design similar to the iAUDIO 9.\n\nWith a screen resolution of 240×400 pixels, the i10 has the highest resolution of any iAUDIO player.\n\nUpon release, the iAUDIO 10 was awarded Japan's Good Design Award.\n\nThe iAUDIO 9+ was released in July 2013. The unit has exactly the same physical and technical specifications as the original iAUDIO 9, except for a slightly larger internal speaker and JetEffect v. 5.0 (the original iAUDIO 9 was released with JetEffect v. 3.0). In addition, the iAUDIO 9+ was made available in models with storage capabilities of 4, 8, 16 and 32 GB, whereas the original iAUDIO 9 was available in 4, 8 and 16 GB models.\n\nAll Cowon media players, starting with the iAUDIO 4, feature a set of sound enhancement technologies collectively referred to as JetEffect, including a technology known as BBE+, licensed from BBE Sound, Inc. The distinction between JetEffect and BBE+ is not always clear.\n\nOn Cowon media players, the JetEffect menu offers the following options:\n\nThe latest version of JetEffect, JetEffect 5, was introduced with the release of the Cowon Z2 Plenue. It included an updated reverb algorithm, allowing the user to choose between nine different types of reverb timbres, including \"Chamber\", \"Room\", \"Club\", \"Hall\", \"Auditorium\", \"Cathedral\", \"Stadium\", \"Canyon\" and \"Long\".\n\nAll Cowon players following the D2+ (S9 and onwards) come with an updated version of BBE called BBE+.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2316934", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316934", "title": "Haplogroup", "text": "Haplogroup\n\nA haplotype is a group of alleles in an organism that are inherited together from a single parent, and a haplogroup (haploid from the , \"haploûs\", \"onefold, simple\" and ) is a group of similar haplotypes that share a common ancestor with a single-nucleotide polymorphism mutation. More specifically, a haplogroup is a combination of alleles at different chromosomal regions that are closely linked and that tend to be inherited together. As a haplogroup consists of similar haplotypes, it is usually possible to predict a haplogroup from haplotypes. Haplogroups pertain to a single line of descent. As such, membership of a haplogroup, by any individual, relies on a relatively small proportion of the genetic material possessed by that individual.\n\nEach haplogroup originates from, and remains part of, a preceding single haplogroup (or paragroup). As such, any related group of haplogroups may be precisely modelled as a nested hierarchy, in which each set (haplogroup) is also a subset of a single broader set (as opposed, that is, to biparental models, such as human family trees).\n\nHaplogroups are normally identified by an initial letter of the alphabet, and refinements consist of additional number and letter combinations, such as (for example) A → A1 → A1a.\n\nIn human genetics, the haplogroups most commonly studied are Y-chromosome (Y-DNA) haplogroups and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups, each of which can be used to define genetic populations. Y-DNA is passed solely along the patrilineal line, from father to son, while mtDNA is passed down the matrilineal line, from mother to offspring of both sexes. Neither recombines, and thus Y-DNA and mtDNA change only by chance mutation at each generation with no intermixture between parents' genetic material.\n\nMitochondria are small organelles that lie in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells, such as those of humans. Their primary function is to provide energy to the cell. Mitochondria are thought to be reduced descendants of symbiotic bacteria that were once free living. One indication that mitochondria were once free living is that each contains a circular DNA, called mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), whose structure is more similar to bacteria than eukaryotic organisms (see endosymbiotic theory). The overwhelming majority of a human's DNA is contained in the chromosomes in the nucleus of the cell, but mtDNA is an exception.\nAn individual inherits his or her cytoplasm and the organelles contained by that cytoplasm exclusively from the maternal ovum (egg cell); sperm only pass on the chromosomal DNA, all paternal mitochondria are digested in the oocyte. When a mutation arises in a mtDNA molecule, the mutation is therefore passed in a direct female line of descent. Mutations are copying mistakes in the DNA sequence. Single mistakes are called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).\n\nHuman Y chromosomes are male-specific sex chromosomes; nearly all humans that possess a Y chromosome will be morphologically male. Although Y chromosomes are situated in the cell nucleus and paired with X chromosomes, they only recombine with the X chromosome at the ends of the Y chromosome; the remaining 95% of the Y chromosome does not recombine. Therefore, the Y chromosome and any mutations that arise in it are passed on from father to son in a direct male line of descent. This means the Y chromosome and mtDNA share specific properties.\n\nOther chromosomes, autosomes and X chromosomes in women, share their genetic material (called crossing over leading to recombination) during meiosis (a special type of cell division that occurs for the purposes of sexual reproduction). Effectively this means that the genetic material from these chromosomes gets mixed up in every generation, and so any new mutations are passed down randomly from parents to offspring.\n\nThe special feature that both Y chromosomes and mtDNA display is that mutations can accrue along a certain segment of both molecules and these mutations remain fixed in place on the DNA. Furthermore, the historical sequence of these mutations can also be inferred. For example, if a set of ten Y chromosomes (derived from ten different men) contains a mutation, A, but only five of these chromosomes contain a second mutation, B, then it must be the case that mutation B occurred after mutation A.\n\nFurthermore, all ten men who carry the chromosome with mutation A are the direct male line descendants of the same man who was the first person to carry this mutation. The first man to carry mutation B was also a direct male line descendant of this man, but is also the direct male line ancestor of all men carrying mutation B. Series of mutations such as this form molecular lineages. Furthermore, each mutation defines a set of specific Y chromosomes called a haplogroup.\n\nAll men carrying mutation A form a single haplogroup, and all men carrying mutation B are part of this haplogroup, but mutation B also defines a more recent haplogroup (which is a subgroup or subclade) of its own to which men carrying only mutation A do not belong. Both mtDNA and Y chromosomes are grouped into lineages and haplogroups; these are often presented as tree like diagrams.\n\nIt is usually assumed that there is little natural selection for or against a particular haplotype mutation which has survived to the present day, so apart from mutation rates (which may vary from one marker to another) the main driver of population genetics affecting the proportions of haplotypes in a population is genetic drift—random fluctuation caused by the sampling randomness of which members of the population happen to pass their DNA on to members of the next generation of the appropriate sex.\n\nThis causes the prevalence of a particular marker in a population to continue to fluctuate, until it either hits 100%, or falls out of the population entirely. In a large population with efficient mixing the rate of genetic drift for common alleles is very low; however, in a very small interbreeding population the proportions can change much more quickly. The marked geographical variations and concentrations of particular haplotypes and groups of haplotypes therefore witness the distinctive effects of repeated population bottlenecks or founder events followed by population separations and increases.\n\nThe lineages which can be traced back from the present will not reflect the full genetic variation of the older population: genetic drift means that some of the variants will have died out. The cost of full Y-DNA and mtDNA sequence tests has limited the availability of data; however, their cost has dropped dramatically in the last decade. Haplotype coalescence times and current geographical prevalences both carry considerable error uncertainties. This is especially troublesome for coalescence times, because most population geneticists still continue (albeit decreasing a little bit) to use the \"Zhivotovski method\", which is heavily criticised by DNA-genealogists for its falsehood. The eusocial wasp \"Angiopolybia pallens \"presents with 8 haplogroups depending on its location. This displays the idea of genetic drift.\n\nHuman Y chromosome DNA (Y-DNA) haplogroups are named from A to T, and are further subdivided using numbers and lower case letters. Y chromosome haplogroup designations are established by the Y Chromosome Consortium.\n\nY-chromosomal Adam is the name given by researchers to the male who is the most recent common patrilineal (male-lineage) ancestor of all living humans.\n\nMajor Y-chromosome haplogroups, and their geographical regions of occurrence (prior to\nthe recent European colonization), include:\n\n\n\n\nY-Chromosome\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2316936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316936", "title": "University of Michigan College of Engineering", "text": "University of Michigan College of Engineering\n\nThe University of Michigan College of Engineering is the engineering unit of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. With an enrollment of 7,133 undergraduate and 3,537 graduate students, the College of Engineering is one of the premier engineering schools in the United States. The College of Engineering is ranked No. 4 in the United States by U.S. News and World Report.\n\nThe college was founded in 1854, with courses in civil engineering. Since its founding, the College of Engineering established some of the earliest programs in various fields such as data science, computer science, electrical engineering, and nuclear engineering. The college's aerospace engineering program celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2014. The Materials Science and Engineering program is the oldest continuing metallurgy and materials program in the United States. \n\nThe college was first located on the University's Central Campus before moving to the University's North Campus — which occupies approximately 800 acres (3.25 km²)— starting in the late 1940s. Today, the College of Engineering is prominently located in the center of the University's North Campus (the Marine Hydrodynamics Laboratory is located on Central Campus), which is shared with the School of Music, Theatre and Dance, School of Art and Design, and the Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning. The North Campus also houses Lurie Tower, one of 2 grand carillons on the Ann Arbor campus, and one of only 23 in the world. Dr. Alec D. Gallimore currently holds the position of Robert J. Vlasic Dean of Engineering.\n\nThe college grants degrees at the Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD levels. The 15 undergraduate degree programs offered by the college are:\n\n\nAlmost all of these programs are ranked in the top ten in the United States according to \"US News and World Report\".\n\nVarious laboratories are located at the college of engineering, including the Center for Wireless Integrated MicroSystems (WIMS) and the Center for Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems (RMS), both of which are NSF laboratories. Another major laboratory is the Center for Ultra-Fast Optical Sciences. The Phoenix Memorial Laboratory is a laboratory dedicated to research into the peaceful use of nuclear technology. It once housed the Ford Nuclear Reactor, which was decommissioned in 2003.\n\nThe College of Engineering also has 11 wind tunnels, electron microscope and ion beam laboratories, a civil engineering test facility, and solid state manufacturing facilities. Various laboratories dedicated to automotive engineering, neutron science, optical sciences, and robotics are scattered throughout the college. A hydrodynamics laboratory is located on the University's Central Campus. An office of the Weather Underground is located at the College of Engineering.\nThe Duderstadt Center, formerly the Media Union and affectionately known as \"The Dude\" by engineering students, is named after former University president and nuclear engineering professor James Duderstadt. It houses the Art, Architecture & Engineering Library and also contains computer clusters, audio and video editing laboratories, galleries, and studios, as well as usability and various digital media laboratories, including virtual reality. The Millennium Project, which focuses on the future of the university learning environment, is also housed in the Duderstadt Center.\n\nComputer services and networking is provided by CAEN, the Computer Aided Engineering Network. CAEN operates various computer laboratories throughout the College of Engineering and the University campuses. It also operates the college's wireless network (with VPN and web-based authentication) and runs daily backups for College of Engineering servers. As of 2007, CAEN no longer maintains separate mail servers for CoE students and faculty.\n\nThe University of Michigan, partnering with the Michigan Department of Transportation, opened a 32-acre proving ground test course for autonomous cars in 2015 called Mcity on the site of a former Pfizer facility which the University purchased in 2009. Mcity contains five miles of roads and includes a mock town square, tunnel, highway exit ramps, a railroad crossing, gravel roadway, traffic circle, roundabout, and other obstacles. Faculty and engineering students will utilize Mcity to work on projects and to collaborate with automakers and suppliers who will test vehicle technology at the course.\n\nCollege of Engineering students are required to understand and adhere to an Honor Code governing the completion of classwork and examinations, as well as conduct when using CAEN computers. If a student observes a violation of the Honor Code, he or she is required by the Honor Code to report it.\n\nDuring examinations, the College of Engineering differs from other University of Michigan academic units in that the instructor is typically not present in the room (i.e., the exam is not proctored).

{"id": "2316962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316962", "title": "Vincenzo Foppa", "text": "Vincenzo Foppa\n\nVincenzo Foppa (c. 1427c. 1515) was an Italian painter from the Renaissance period. While few of his works survive, he was an esteemed and influential painter during his time and is considered the preeminent leader of the Early Lombard School. He spent his career working for the Sforza family, Dukes of Milan, in Pavia, as well as various other patrons throughout Lombardy and Liguria. He lived and worked in his native Brescia during his later years.\n\nVery little is known about the early life and training of Foppa. He was born in Bagnolo Mella, a small commune near the city of Brescia. At the time, there were few esteemed painters in the region, and the art scene in Brescia was lacking. It is therefore likely that Foppa had to seek artistic training elsewhere. Some of his earliest exposures to art were likely frescoes painted by Gentile da Fabriano in the Broletto Chapel in Brescia and the woven \"Annunciation\" by Jacopo Bellini. The latter artist was one of the strongest influences on him, and it is possible that Foppa was directly apprenticed to Bellini. He also may have been apprenticed to Bonifacio Bembo. Some historians suggest that Foppa may have had early training in Padua with Francesco Squarcione, though his earliest works are more stylistically reminiscent of Pisanello and Gentile da Fabriano. It is most likely that Foppa went to Verona for his training.\n\nThe earliest known work attributed to Foppa is \"The Madonna and Child with Angels\". Compositionally, this painting is reminiscent of the Veronese style due to its Gothic appearance, contributing to speculation that Foppa was trained in Verona, possibly by Stefano or Michelino da Besozzo. However, the piece also has unique aspects indicative of the artist's personal touch, such as the grayish skin tone, which would become a defining aspect of the Lombard school. However, the figures in \"The Madonna and Child with Angels\" are not nearly as lifelike as those featured in the painter's later works. The next work known to be by Foppa's hand is his \"Crucifixion\", painted at Bergamo in 1456. This work marked a significant step forward for Vincenzo, as his representation of humans matured considerably between the completion of the \"Madonna\" and the \"Crucifixion.\" The painting is exceedingly similar to a Jacopo Bellini work of the same name, lending credibility to the notion that Foppa may have spent time training with Bellini in Venice. The work also uses elements associated with the Veronese school, such as the hilly landscape and fictional city featured in the background. While the composition is nearly identical to the earlier Bellini work, Foppa's delicate coloring and advanced naturalist depiction of the three crucified men indicate his considerable talent, even at such an early stage of his career.\n\nBy 1456, Vincenzo Foppa was working independently as an artist and had likely moved to Pavia, where he was living by 1458 at the latest. By this time, he had married a fellow Brescian by the name of Caylina, the daughter of Caterina de Bolis of Cremona, and had children with her. The art community in Pavia was more developed than that in Brescia, although less so than in Milan thanks to the leadership of Michelino da Besozzo. At some point, Foppa was contracted by the Sforza family to work in Pavia. This arrangement was likely facilitated by Bartolomeo Gadio, overseer in chief for the Duke, and Foppa likely worked first on the Castello of Pavia. While it is unclear what works Foppa was specifically enlisted for, he clearly made a strong impression on Duke Francesco Sforza. Vincenzo received an effusively praiseful letter of recommendation from Sforza which enabled him to receive patronage from the Doge of Genoa and the priors of the confraternity of St. John for frescoes in the Chapel of St. John the Baptist in the Cathedral of Genoa. Foppa had gone to Genoa in 1461 to evade the plague present in Pavia at the time, returning to Pavia in 1462 with only the ceiling completed. He eventually returned to complete the Chapel in 1471, though all of his work there was lost in the 16th century. In the following year, Foppa painted a number of works that have since been lost, such as an altarpiece for the Chapel of St. Bernardino at Morimondo and frescoes from the life of the Blessed Isnardo of Vicenza in the Dominican Church of St. Tommaso at Pavia.\n\nIn 1463, Foppa was called to Milan by Francesco Sforza to work on various projects. The first of these was a fresco for the portico of the new Ospedale Maggiore, depicting the Sforza family ceremonially laying the first stone for the hospital. The architect of the hospital was Filarete, who later honored Vincenzo Foppa as one of the greatest painters of the era. Foppa was the only painter of Lombardy to receive this distinction. Following this, Foppa painted a series of frescoes to decorate the Medici Bank of Milan, a palazzo building gifted by Francesco Sforza to Cosimo de' Medici. His work there began in 1464, overseen by the representative of the Medici Bank in Milan Pigello Portinari, and was completed by 1467. The frescoes included a series of eight Roman emperors (including one of Trajan for which a provisional sketch still exists) and a portrait of the Francesco Sforza and his family. The only surviving fresco from this building features a small boy reading, with the name Cicero engraved on the bench behind him. This work, titled \"The Young Cicero Reading\", is the only known secular work by Foppa that survives today and is located at the Wallace Collection in London. The subject of the painting has been debated by historians, with suggestions including Gian Galeazzo Sforza (grandson of Francesco), Augustus' grandson, and Cicero himself.\n\nIn 1468, Foppa was again commissioned by Pigello Portinari to decorate the Portinari Chapel at Saint Eustorgio in Milan. The Chapel holds the remains of Saint Peter Martyr of Verona, and for a time held those of Portinari himself. While it is not certain that Foppa painted the Chapel himself, the fresco cycle \"Life of St. Peter Martyr\" is commonly attributed to him. His work in the Chapel also includes a \"Doctors of the Church\" cycle, busts of saints, and an \"Annunciation\". The rainbow decoration of the ribbed dome likely represents a “Beatific Vision” of an arrival in paradise, with the rainbow signifying God and implying Portinari's piety. The frescoes in the Chapel display an advanced and creative use of perspective by Foppa, featuring vanishing points outside of the composition. Combined with his use of light and placement of the scenes in everyday settings, this “Lombard perspective” makes the scenes come to life.\n\nAfter the death of his father Francesco, Duke Galeazzo Maria Sforza continued his family's close relationship with Foppa, first commissioning an altarpiece at Monza in 1466 and making him a member of the ducal household in 1468. Upon a request from Foppa in 1468, the new Duke granted him citizenship in Pavia and safe conduct for six years, allowing the painter to move about Milanese territorial holdings without tolls or taxes.\n\nFoppa returned to Brescia to paint an altarpiece for the Church of Saint Maria Maddalena in 1472, but had returned to Milan by 1473. Several surviving Madonnas were likely completed around this period, or at some point in the 1460s. Some of these paintings are made to look almost like reliefs or sculptures, exhibiting the influence that sculptors such as Donatello.\nIn 1474, Foppa collaborated with Zanetto Bugatto and Bonifacio Bembo on an ambitious altarpiece for the Castello of Pavia, but work on the project was halted when Galeazzo Sforza was murdered in 1476. Some surviving panels have been speculated to be part of this Castello project. The trio also worked on various other commissions in Pavia. Foppa completed several ecclesiastical works during the latter part of the decade, including a number of works featuring the Virgin and Child. Foppa became renowned for these Virgin and Child works, which he continued to produce in the 1480s and for the rest of his career. Many of these pieces are nearly identically composed: Mary holding the baby Jesus in front of a curtain, landscape, or other similar background. Vincenzo did a number of works for Santa Maria di Brera in Milan, including a polyptych titled \"Virgin and Child with Saints\" finished around 1476 and a fresco titled \"Virgin and Child with Saints John the Baptist and John the Evangelist\" dated 1485. At Santa Maria di Brera he also completed a fresco of Saint Sebastian, a subject whom Foppa painted several times during the decade. By 1486, Foppa had completed the Bottigella Altarpiece in Brescia, which depicted Silvestro Bottigella and his wife genuflect in front of the Virgin Mary.\n\nBy 1489, Foppa was back to Liguria, completing a since-destroyed altarpiece for the Doria Chapel of the Certosa di Rivarola near Genoa in February. The following year Foppa completed another altarpiece, this one for the oratory of Santa Maria di Castello in Savona. This work was commissioned by Giuliano della Rovere, a recurring patron of Foppa during his time spent in Savona. In 1490, Foppa was granted a yearly allowance of 100 lire by Brescia in exchange for continued artistic contributions to the city, marking his return home. In the same year he frescoed the central \"Loggetta\" of the town. He continued to work painting numerous devotional works during his remaining years, which he spent largely in his native Brescia as well as Pavia. His latest known work is dated 1514, and he is believed to have died in 1515 or 1516 in Brescia.\n\nFoppa's style was heavily influenced by Bellini, Pisanello, and Mantegna. His human figures are typically shown with a silvery-gray skin tone, a feature that has become the identifying quality of the Lombard school. This coloration gives the subjects an almost morbid appearance. Foppa was celebrated for his use of perspective, light and coloration. While contemporary documents label Foppa as an architect as well as painter, there are no known buildings or structures that he designed. In his \"Adoration of the Kings\", likely painted around the turn of the 16th century, the artist used \"pastiglia,\" or paste-work, to provide the work with depth and brightness. He accomplished this by the \"sgraffito\" method, laying gold leaf under the area where the three Magi were located in the piece, painting them over the gold, and then scraping off paint to give their crowns and other adornments a genuine golden sheen. The vast majority of Foppa's known works are religious in subject, with a particular focus on paintings of the Virgin with Child. He did not venture far into other subject matters, although due to his dependence on commissions this may not have been a personal choice. However, this limited scope is likely biased due to which works have survived the centuries, as many of his fresco cycles have been lost to history, and most surviving works are small devotional pieces or altarpiece panels.\n\nFoppa was renowned as the greatest painter of his era in Lombardy and is considered the founder of the Early Lombard School. While art communities existed in Pavia and Milan before his arrival, it was his work that gave Lombard art an identity and a renewed vitality. During the peak of his career from the 1460s to the 1480s, he was the dominant influence on Lombard art, and contemporary documents testify to his highly esteemed reputation amongst both his patrons and the rest of the artistic community. Foppa was confident in his merit and ability to receive commissions, as he often left cities with jobs unfinished to pursue work elsewhere that he found more interesting or more lucrative. There is evidence showing that at times he had to be exhorted or pressured to complete more trivial works that did not interest him. There are multiple artists who exhibit significant influence by Foppa, including Vincenzo Civerchio, Ambrogio Bergognone, and Girolamo Romanino. His long-term influence was somewhat diminished due to the arrival of Leonardo da Vinci in Milan in 1482. Leonardo's massive persona and artistic influence diluted the importance of Foppa's style. His perception in modern times is also damaged by the sheer volume of his work that has been lost. While he was a prolific painter during his career, relatively few pieces painted by Foppa have survived into the modern era.\n"}

She was elected Public Advocate for New York City in 2001 and reelected in 2005. She was the third woman elected to a citywide post in NYC history. The other two were Carol Bellamy, who served as City Council President from 1978–1985, and Elizabeth Holtzman, who served as Comptroller from 1990–1993. She is a Democrat.\n\nFlower attended The Brearley School and graduated from the Masters School in Dobbs Ferry in 1956. She attended Connecticut College for two years, followed by Barnard College. She earned her B.A. from George Washington University in 1961. After graduation, she moved to Recife, Brazil, where she taught high school English and mastered Spanish and Portuguese. She returned to New York several years later and earned a master's degree in Education from Teachers College, Columbia University.\n\nGotbaum became involved in civic affairs in the 1970s, while serving on the staff of former Mayor John Lindsay as District Manager for the Chelsea-Clinton (Manhattan West) Neighborhood, Assistant for Women's Issues, and Assistant for Education. She continued her work in education with Mayor Abraham Beame, managing a training program for school security officers. In the late 1970s, she was recruited to run the New York City Police Foundation. At the Police Foundation, she developed an innovative citywide health screening and work-site hypertension program with the New York City Police Department and facilitated an intensive training program for 911 operators. She created a program engaging New York City in a campaign to purchase bulletproof vests for every police officer. In 1990 newly elected Mayor David Dinkins appointed her the first female Commissioner of the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. Gotbaum created a toll-free Parks hotline and successfully argued for a change in city policy allowing Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC) and other organizations use of Central Park for fundraising events. \n\nAfter leaving the Parks Department in 1994, Gotbaum became President of the New-York Historical Society, a position she held until launching her campaign for Public Advocate in 2001. When she took over, the Historical Society was closed to the public and on the verge of bankruptcy after years of mismanagement. Gotbaum rescued the institution from financial collapse, renovated its landmark building, and recalled its collections from various warehouses. In November 2000, she opened the Henry Luce III Center for the Study of American Culture. She instituted exhibitions, education and public programs for a diverse and ever-increasing audience, leaving the society with a $33 million endowment. Gotbaum resigned from the Historical Society to run for the Office of the Public Advocate. \n\nIn 2001, Gotbaum finished first in the Democratic primary and then defeated Norman Siegel in the Democratic runoff. She was unopposed in the general election. As Public Advocate she focused on education policy, along with women's issues, child welfare, affordable housing and senior services. She was known to work with Mayor Michael Bloomberg on certain issues, but she battled Bloomberg on mayoral succession issues. In return, Bloomberg sought to eliminate the office altogether in 2002 and reduced its budget. At the request of the New York State Legislature, Gotbaum created a Commission on School Governance to examine mayoral control before it expires in 2009. \n\nIn the September 13, 2005 Democratic primary, Gotbaum beat civil rights advocate Norman Siegel, and real estate broker Michael Brown came in third with fifteen percent of NYC's vote. She was unopposed in the general election. She took the oath of office for a second term on January 1, 2006. \n\nDespite the extension of New York City term limits, which made Gotbaum eligible for a third term, she decided not to run for reelection.\n\nHer husband, Victor Gotbaum (1921-2015) was a retired New York City labor leader who served for 22 years as president of AFSCME District Council 37, New York's largest public employee union.

It was designed to improve developer productivity and simplify code. WebWork was built on top of XWork, which provided a generic command pattern framework as well as an Inversion of Control container.\n\nWebWork provided support for building reusable UI templates, such as form controls, UI themes, internationalization, dynamic form parameter mapping to JavaBeans, client and server side validation, etc.\n\nIn a standard Java EE web application, the client will typically submit information to the server via a web form. The information is then either handed over to a Java Servlet which processes it, interacts with a database and produces an HTML-formatted response, or it is given to a JavaServer Pages (JSP) document which intermingles HTML and Java code to achieve the same result. Both approaches are often considered inadequate for large projects because they mix application logic with presentation and make maintenance difficult.\n\nWebWork's designers attempted to understand what they regarded as existing frameworks' limitations, and to work to eliminate them. It supports type conversion, continuations, and interceptors. WebWork also supports multiple-view technologies like JSP, velocity, and FreeMarker.\n\nWebWork was designed and implemented with a specific set of goals:\n\n\nThe architecture of WebWork was based on the MVC Framework, Command, and Dispatcher patterns and the principle of Inversion of Control. The life cycle of a WebWork request begins when the servlet container receives a new request. The new request is passed through a set of filters called the filter chain and sent to the FilterDispatcher. The FilterDispatcher forwards the request to the ActionMapper to determine what needs to be done with the request. If the request requires an action, it sends an ActionMapping object back to the FilterDispatcher. If not, ActionMapper returns a null object, indicating that no action needs to be taken. The FilterDispatcher forwards the request and the ActionMapper object to the ActionProxy for further action. The ActionProxy invokes the Configuration File manager to get the attributes of the action, which is stored in the xwork.xml file and creates an ActionInvocation object. The ActionInvocation object contains attributes like the action, invocation context, result, result code, etc. The configuration file manager has access to these configuration files and is used by the ActionProxy as a gateway to the configuration files. The ActionInvocation object also has information about Interceptors that need to be invoked after or before an action is executed.\n\nActionInvocation invokes all the interceptors listed in the ActionInvocation object and then invokes the actual action. When the action is completed, ActionInvocation gets the action result code from the execution. It uses the action result code to look up the appropriate result, which is usually a JSP page, a velocity template or a freemarker template associated with the result code. ActionInvocation also executes the interceptors again in the reverse order and returns the response as a HttpServletResponse.\n\nOn November 27, 2005, WebWork developer Patrick Lightbody announced that WebWork would be merging in to Struts2. While the next major release (WebWork 2.2.x) was released under the WebWork name, all future major revisions (namely, 2.3.x and beyond) would be folded into Struts2.\n\nTed Husted, developer of Struts said in an email that WebWork was very similar to Struts 1.x and did certain things better than Struts. Both Husted and Lightbody's rationale was that combining WebWork's technology with Struts' community would benefit both projects.\n\nWebWork uses the OpenSymphony Software License which is a modified (and fully compatible with) Apache Software License.\n\n"}
{"id": "2316979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316979", "title": "Lost-foam casting", "text": "Lost-foam casting\n\nLost-foam casting (LFC) is a type of evaporative-pattern casting process that is similar to investment casting except foam is used for the pattern instead of wax. This process takes advantage of the low boiling point of polymer foams to simplify the investment casting process by removing the need to melt the wax out of the mold.\n\nFirst, a pattern is made from polystyrene foam, which can be done by many different ways. For small volume runs the pattern can be hand cut or machined from a solid block of foam; if the geometry is simple enough it can even be cut using a hot-wire foam cutter. If the volume is large, then the pattern can be mass-produced by a process similar to injection molding. Pre-expanded beads of polystyrene are injected into a preheated aluminum mold at low pressure. Steam is then applied to the polystyrene which causes it to expand more to fill the die. The final pattern is approximately 97.5% air and 2.5% polystyrene. Pre-made pouring basins, runners, and risers can be hot glued to the pattern to finish it.\n\nNext, the foam cluster is coated with ceramic investment, also known as the refractory coating, via dipping, brushing, spraying or flow coating. After the coating dries, the cluster is placed into a flask and backed up with un-bonded sand which is compacted using a vibration table. The refractory coating captures all of the detail in the foam model and creates a barrier between the smooth foam surface and the coarse sand surface. Secondly it controls permeability, which allows the gas created by the vaporized foam pattern to escape through the coating and into the sand. Controlling permeability is a crucial step to avoid sand erosion. Finally, it forms a barrier so that molten metal does not penetrate or cause sand erosion during pouring. Once the sand is compacted, the mold is ready to be poured. Automatic pouring is commonly used in LFC, as the pouring process is significantly more critical than in conventional foundry practice.\n\nThere is no bake-out phase, as for lost-wax. The melt is poured directly into the foam-filled mold, burning out the foam as it pours. As the foam is of low density, the waste gas produced by this is relatively small and can escape through mold permeability, as for the usual outgassing control.\n\nCommonly cast metals include cast irons, aluminium alloys, steels, and nickel alloys; less frequently stainless steels and copper alloys are also cast. The size range is from to several tonnes (tons). The minimum wall thickness is and there is no upper limit. Typical surface finishes are from 2.5 to 25 µm (100 to 1000 µin) RMS. Typical linear tolerances are ±0.005 mm/mm (0.005 in/in).\n\nThis casting process is advantageous for very complex castings that would regularly require cores. It is also dimensionally accurate, maintains an excellent surface finish, requires no draft, and has no parting lines so no flash is formed. The un-bonded sand of lost foam casting can be much simpler to maintain than green sand and resin bonded sand systems. Lost foam is generally more economical than investment casting because it involves fewer steps. Risers are not usually required due to the nature of the process; because the molten metal vaporizes the foam the first metal into the mold cools more quickly than the rest, which results in natural directional solidification. Foam is easy to manipulate, carve and glue, due to its unique properties. The flexibility of LFC often allows for consolidating the parts into one integral component; other forming processes would require the production of one or more parts to be assembled.\n\nThe two main disadvantages are that pattern costs can be high for low volume applications and the patterns are easily damaged or distorted due to their low strength. If a die is used to create the patterns there is a large initial cost.\n\nLost-foam casting was invented in the early fifties by Canadian sculptor Armand Vaillancourt. Public recognition of the benefits of LFC was made by General Motors in the mid 1980s when it announced its new car line, Saturn, would utilize LFC for production of all engine blocks, cylinder heads, crankshafts, differential carriers, and transmission cases.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2316998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2316998", "title": "Namorita", "text": "Namorita\n\nNamorita Prentiss is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. She is a mutant clone of her mother, Namora, and a member of the New Warriors. She was killed in the explosion in Stamford that started the Superhero Civil War. She was later restored to life.\n\nNamorita first appeared in \"Sub-Mariner\" #50 (June 1972), created by Bill Everett. She mostly served as a supporting character for Namor until she was cast as a founding member of the New Warriors in 1989. She played a prominent role in the first three volumes of the team's book, and has appeared several times in the solo comics of her Warriors teammate and sometimes-romantic interest Nova.\n\nNamorita's mother, Namora, was the first cousin of Namor, and, like Namor, was a hybrid with superhuman strength and the power of flight by using the ankle wings on her feet. Unlike Namor, her \"mother\" was human and her \"father\" Atlantean.\n\nNamora's sterility created tension with her husband Talan. Upon meeting Vyrra, an Atlantean scientist who had been exiled for practicing the forbidden science of cloning, she requested that he make a clone of her to which she could give birth. After the clone, Namorita, was born, Talan was killed by an atomic explosion. Consequently, Namora raised the child in Lemuria. \n\nNamora met her (presumed) death at the hands of Llyra, her rival for the affections of a Lemurian prince. Namora did not reveal to her daughter that she was a clone before her death.\n\nLlyra and Byrrah, another cousin of Namor, decided to deploy Namorita in a plot against Namor, threatening that they would destroy Namora's seemingly dead (but actually only frozen) body if she did not lure Namor into a trap. In her first encounter with Namor since reaching adolescence, Namorita was captured by Byrrah, but rescued by Namor. Namor and Namorita would eventually unite to defeat Llyra and Byrrah. She revealed her past to Namor, and developed an infatuation with Namor. She convinced Namor to free Byrrah. \n\nWhen Namorita first visited New York City, Namor introduced her to his long-time friend Betty Dean Prentiss, whom Namorita would eventually consider a guardian and second mother. Namorita used Prentiss for her surname while in the surface world. Betty Prentiss would eventually be killed by Dr. Lemuel Dorcas, Namor's enemy.\n\nNamorita rescued a drowning Wundarr from his people, the Dakkamites. She left him with the Thing as a guardian, and became Wundarr's guardian for a time herself. Namorita was later abducted by Llyra, who nearly succeeded in tricking Namor into killing her. However, Namorita was rescued by him instead.\n\nSome time later, Namorita enrolled in college at Empire State University. During a trip, she was forced to battle long-time Fantastic Four foe, Terrax. She was joined by five other young superheroes, and after Nita and Nova subdued Terrax by severing his contact with the ground, the six formed the New Warriors. When Namor decided to start a financial empire a short time later, Nita joined him as a member of the board of Oracle, Inc. Around Namor, Namorita was always deferential, but around the Warriors she would act tough.\n\nNamorita, as a New Warrior, aided Thor in battling Juggernaut. She was engulfed and subsequently rescued from Sluj by Namor. She and her fellow Warriors first battled Psionex, then fought the third Star Thief and journeyed to the Blue Area of the Moon, where they encountered the Inhumans Royal Family and the Watcher. Namorita was beaten by Neo-Nazis in Berlin. She escaped to England, where she was reunited with Jacqueline Crichton and Union Jack, and fought Warrior Woman. She then discovered that she was a clone. After being severely beaten by the scavenger known as Sea Urchin, she first swapped her usual green bathing suit for Atlantean armor, then soundly beat the Urchin in a rematch.\n\nWhen team founder Night Thrasher took a hiatus from the Warriors, Namorita led the team. However, the stress of leading the Warriors, the revelation of her cloned nature, and ruling Atlantis during Namor's absence all proved to be too much for her. She became drunk at a nightclub and left with the leader of the Poison Memories gang, who wanted to gain vengeance against the Warriors. He stole information from Namorita's apartment which was used to kidnap many of the Warriors' family members. After the surviving family members were rescued, Namorita's guilt over the incident forced her to leave the Warriors.\n\nNamorita returned to Atlantis, only to be denied entry as the Atlanteans discovered her clone nature. This seemed to be the final catalyst for Nita. An over-saturation of oxygen, coupled with the DNA Vyrra spliced into her at the time of her creation, caused her to change into a closer version of the original Atlanteans. Because of this, Namorita gave herself the name Kymaera. While fighting alongside the Warriors, she was captured and brainwashed by a terrorist organization, only to be rescued by Night Thrasher (who received a tip from the Mad Thinker).\n\nOn one occasion, Namorita became covered with pus-filled boils. Her lover Nova saw her in this state and did not speak in time to reassure the emotionally vulnerable Namorita that his feelings for her had not changed. His hesitation sent her over the edge, and she left. A crestfallen Namorita went to take a shower and, to her surprise, her skin returned to its original pink tone. She also shed her pointed ears, webbed hands, and glassy black eyes. Following this transformation, Namorita continued to mutate and developed new powers. She found that she could secrete burning acid or a paralytic toxin and could become transparent. After her breakup with Nova, Namorita briefly dated Johnny Storm (the Human Torch), and co-ruled Atlantis in a Council of Three with Warlord Seth and the warrior Andromeda. Ultimately, Namorita and Nova came to terms over the break-up.\n\nNamorita was among the four New Warriors whose actions sparked the public backlash against masked superheroes which is at the core of Marvel's \"Civil War\". The new Warriors are trying to film a reality show, and find four villains on the FBI Most Wanted List, who they attack. Slamming Nitro into a school bus, Namorita taunted him until he caused a massive explosion. Namorita was within a foot of Nitro when he exploded, killing 612 people.\n\nSubsequently, she was listed as \"deceased\" on the website revealing the secret identities of the surviving members of the New Warriors, and Speedball is then confirmed as the only survivor of the blast.\n\nThree undercover Atlanteans track down Nitro under orders from Namor to avenge the murder of a member of the Atlantean Royal Family. When the Invisible Woman asks for help from Prince Namor, he tells her that the only reason he would help is due to Namorita's death, and he has already avenged that.\n\nNamorita's remains, along with Dwayne's and Microbe's, are later recovered by the New Warriors and Justice's Counter Initiative team, and given a proper burial. During Hercules' journey to the underworld, Namorita was seen in Erebus gambling for her resurrection.\n\nIn \"Nova\", a time displaced Namorita was rescued by a time displaced Nova within the Fault, having been summoned alongside time-displaced versions of Mister Fantastic, Black Bolt and Darkhawk by the Sphinx to battle his younger self. Through some sort of paradox after Nova defeated the Sphinx once more, Namorita is brought into his present.\n\nWhile having slow adjustment to her rebirth, Namorita was kidnapped by the Revengers, a facsimile of the Avengers originating from the Cancerverse, after determining that she was a quantum anomaly. She was later rescued by Nova, and mourned his death after he and Star-Lord stayed behind in the collapsing Cancerverse to contain Thanos. As part of the effort against the Cancerverse, she teamed up with an aged version of her old ally Vance Astrovik, otherwise known as Major Victory.\n\nNamorita is a genetically altered clone of her mother, a mutant member of the evolutionary offshoot of the human race called \"Homo Mermanus\". Namorita's powers came from being a hybrid of Atlantean \"homo mermanus\" and mutant \"homo superior\" physiologies. As such, she has superhuman strength and durability, and all her physical attributes increased further while immersed in water. Namorita's physical attributes decreased the longer she spends time out of water; renewed contact with water immediately restored them to their peak. She had the ability to survive underwater for indefinite periods, and specially developed vision which gave her the ability to see clearly in the murky depths of the ocean. She had a limited empathic rapport with Namor the Sub-Mariner and, like him and her mother, she had ankle wings that granted the power of flight. Unlike her mother or Namor she had some additional powers that seems to be related to her emotional state triggering dormant Atlantean genes. She was able to secrete corrosive acid or paralyzing toxin from her skin and possessed some kind of octopoid camouflage. Namorita had the ability to change her skin color as camouflage (the effect was so convincing it seemed as though she could actually turn invisible).\n\nNamorita was trained in Atlantean methods of hand-to-hand and weapons combat. She speaks English, Atlantean, and Lemurian. She sometimes wears Atlantean battle armor of unknown composition.\n\nIn the \"Marvel 1602\", Namorita was called Rita here and was the sister of Numenor (this reality's version of Namor) and lives in Bensaylum (this reality's version of Atlantis).\n\nFollowing the demise of the X-Men in the \"What If?\" story \"What If the X-Men Died on their First Mission?\", Namorita joins the Beast's hastily assembled mutant hero team - consisting of herself, Theresa Cassidy (who named herself Banshee in honor of her late father), Rahne Sinclair, James Proudstar, the Scarlet Witch and her brother Quicksilver - to combat Count Nefaria and his Ani-Men, and in the end joins the new X-Men team.\n\n\n\nVarious items have been marketed featuring Namorita. In June 2007 Wizkids marketed through their Avengers line a Namorita HeroClix figurine with card. Namorita was featured in Marvel Universe Trading Cards — Series 1 (1990, card #85), Series 2 (1991, card #156), Series 3 (1992, cards #49 and 174), Series 4 (1993, card #22), and Series 5 (1994, card #167). Namorita was also included in a number of T-shirts, posters, and art prints featuring New Warriors.\n\n"}

{"id": "2317006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317006", "title": "Ecoforestry", "text": "Ecoforestry\n\nEcoforestry has been defined as selection forestry or restoration forestry. The main idea of Ecoforestry is to maintain or restore the forest to standards where the forest may still be harvested for products on a sustainable basis. Ecoforestry is forestry that emphasizes holistic practices which strive to protect and restore ecosystems rather than maximize economic productivity. Sustainability of the forest also comes with uncertainties. There are other factors that may affect the forest furthermore than that of the harvesting. There are internal conditions such as effects of soil compaction, tree damage, disease, fire, and blow down that also directly affect the ecosystem. These factors have to be taken into account when determining the sustainability of a forest. If these factors are added to the harvesting and production that comes out of the forest, then the forest will become less likely to survive, and will then become less sustainable.\n\nSince the forest is considered an ecosystem, it is dependent on all of the living and non-living factors within itself. This is a major part of why the forest needs to be sustainable before it is harvested. For example, a tree, by way of photosynthesis, converts sunlight to sugars for respiration to keep the tree alive. The remains of the converted sugars is left in roots for consumption by the organisms surrounding the tree in the habitat. This shows the productivity of an ecosystem with its inhabitants. Productivity within the ecosystem cannot come to fruition unless the forest is sustainable enough to be harvested. If most individual organisms of the ecosystem vanish, the ecosystem itself is at risk. Once that happens, there is no longer any forest to harvest from. The overall productivity of a system can be found in an equation where the Net Primary Production, or NPP, is equal to the Gross Primary Production, or GPP, minus the Respiration, or R. The formula is the NPP = GPP - R. The NPP is the overall efficiency of the plants in the ecosystem. Through having a constant efficiency in NPP, the ecosystem is then more sustainable. The GPP refers to the rate of energy stored by photosynthesis in plants. The R refers to the maintenance and reproduction of plants from the energy expended.\n\nEcoforestry has many principles within the existence of itself. It covers sustainable development and the fair harvesting of the organisms living within the forest ecosystem. There have been many proposals of principles outlined for ecoforestry. They are covered over books, articles, and environmental agencies. All of the principles relate to the idea that in ecoforestry, less should be harvested, and diversity must be managed. Through harvesting less, there is enough biomass left in the forest, so that the forest may stay healthy and still stay maintained. It will grow at a sustainable level annually, and thus it will be able to still be harvested the following year. Through management of the diversity, species may cohabitate in an ecosystem where the forest may feed off of other species in its growth and production. The Principles of Ecoforestry may be found below.\n\nThe principles of ecoforestry are:\n\n\n"}

In particular it is a linear IRD and one of the most liquid, benchmark products spanning multiple currencies simultaneously. It has pricing associations with interest rate swaps (IRSs), foreign exchange (FX) rates, and FX swaps (FXSs). \n\nA cross-currency swap's (XCS's) effective description is a derivative contract, agreed between two counterparties, which specifies the nature of an exchange of payments benchmarked against two interest rate indexes denominated in two different currencies. It also specifies an initial exchange of notional currency in each different currency and the terms of that repayment of notional currency over the life of the swap.\n\nThe most common XCS, and that traded in interbank markets, is a mark-to-market (MTM) XCS, whereby notional exchanges are regularly made throughout the life of the swap according to FX rate fluctuations. This is done to maintain a swap whose MTM value remains neutral and does not become either a large asset or liability (due to FX rate fluctuations) throughout its life.\n\nThe more unconventional, but simpler to define, non-MTM XCS includes an upfront notional exchange of currencies with a re-exchange of that same notional at maturity of the XCS. \n\nThe floating index referenced in each currency is commonly the 3-month tenor interbank offered rate (IBOR) in the appropriate currency, for example LIBOR in USD, GBP, EURIBOR in EUR or STIBOR in SEK.\n\nEach series of payments (either denominated in the first currency or the second) is termed a 'leg', so a typical XCS has two legs, composed separately of interest payments and notional exchanges. To completely determine any XCS a number of parameters must be specified for each leg; the notional principal amount (or varying notional schedule including exchanges), the start and end dates and date scheduling, the chosen floating interest rate indexes and tenors, and day count conventions for interest calculations.\n\nThe pricing element of a XCS is what is known as the basis spread, which is the agreed amount chosen to be added (or reduced in the case of a negative spread) to one leg of the swap. Usually this is the domestic leg, or non-USD leg. For example a EUR/USD XCS would have the basis spread attached to the EUR denominated leg.\n\nXCSs are over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives.\n\nAs OTC instruments, cross-currency swaps (XCSs) can be customised in a number of ways and can be structured to meet the specific needs of the counterparties. For example; payment dates could be irregular, the notional of the swap could be amortized over time, reset dates (or fixing dates) of the floating rate could be irregular, mandatory break clauses may be inserted into the contract, FX notional payments and FX rates may be manually specified etc. \n\nAdditionally it is not a requirement for swaps to have two floating legs. This leads to the naming convention of different types of XCS:\n\nCurrency swaps have many uses, some are itemized:\n\nCross-currency swaps are an integral component in modern financial markets as they are the bridge needed for assessment of yields on a standardised USD basis. For this reason they are also used as the construction tool in creating collateralized discount curves for valuing a future cashflow in a given currency but collateralized with another currency. Given the importance of collateral to the financial system at large, cross-currency swaps are important as a hedging instrument to insure against material collateral mismatches and devaluation.\n\nFor instance, a US-based company needing to borrow Swiss francs, and a Swiss-based company needing to borrow a similar present value in US dollars, could both reduce their exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by arranging either of the following:\n\nSuppose the British Petroleum Company plans to issue five-year bonds worth £100 million at 7.5% interest, but actually needs an equivalent amount in dollars, $150 million (current $/£ rate is $1.50/£), to finance its new refining facility in the U.S. Also, suppose that the Piper Shoe Company, a U. S. company, plans to issue $150 million in bonds at 10%, with a maturity of five years, but it really needs £100 million to set up its distribution center in London. To meet each other's needs, suppose that both companies go to a swap bank that sets up the following agreements:\nThe British Petroleum Company will issue 5-year £100 million bonds paying 7.5% interest. It will then deliver the £100 million to the swap bank who will pass it on to the U.S. Piper Company to finance the construction of its British distribution center.\nThe Piper Company will issue 5-year $150 million bonds paying 10% interest. The Piper Company will then pass the $150 million to swap bank that will pass it on to the British Petroleum Company who will use the funds to finance the construction of its U.S. refinery.\nThe British company, with its U.S. asset (refinery), will pay the 10% interest on $150 million ($15 million) to the swap bank who will pass it on to the American company so it can pay its U.S. bondholders.\nThe American company, with its British asset (distribution center), will pay the 7.5% interest on £100 million ((.075)( £100m) = £7.5 million), to the swap bank who will pass it on to the British company so it can pay its British bondholders.\nAt maturity, the British company will pay $150 million to the swap bank who will pass it on to the American company so it can pay its U.S. bondholders.\nAt maturity, the American company will pay £100 million to the swap bank who will pass it on to the British company so it can pay its British bondholders.\n\nIt is well recognized that traditional \"textbook\" theory does not price cross currency (basis) swaps correctly, because it assumes the funding cost in each currency to be equal to its floating rate, thus always giving a zero cross currency spread. This is clearly contrary to what is observed in the market. In reality, market participants have different levels of access to funds in different currencies and therefore their funding costs are not always equal to LIBOR.\n\nAn approach to work around this is to select one currency as the funding currency (e.g. USD), and select one curve in this currency as the discount curve (e.g. USD interest rate swap curve against 3M LIBOR). Cashflows in the funding currency are discounted on this curve. Cashflows in any other currency are first swapped into the funding currency via a cross currency swap and then discounted. See for further discussion, as well as a description of the related curve build.\n\nXCSs expose users to many different types of financial risk.\n\nPredominantly they expose the user to market risks. The value of a XCS will change as market interest rates, FX rates, and XCS rates rise and fall. In market terminology this is often referred to as delta and basis risks. Other specific types of market risk that interest rate swaps have exposure to are single currency basis risks (where various IBOR tenor indexes can deviate from one another) and reset risks (where the publication of specific tenor IBOR indexes are subject to daily fluctuation). XCSs also exhibit gamma risk whereby their delta risk, basis risks or FX exposures, increase or decrease as market interest rates fluctuate.\n\nUncollateralised XCSs (that are those executed bilaterally without a credit support annex (CSA) in place) expose the trading counterparties to funding risks and credit risks. Funding risks because the value of the swap might deviate to become so negative that it is unaffordable and cannot be funded. Credit risks because the respective counterparty, for whom the value of the swap is positive, will be concerned about the opposing counterparty defaulting on its obligations.\n\nCollateralised XCSs expose the users to collateral risks. Depending upon the terms of the CSA, the type of posted collateral that is permitted might become more or less expensive due to other extraneous market movements. Credit and funding risks still exist for collateralised trades but to a much lesser extent.\n\nDue to regulations set out in the Basel III Regulatory Frameworks trading interest rate derivatives commands a capital usage. Dependent upon their specific nature XCSs might command more capital usage and this can deviate with market movements. Thus capital risks are another concern for users.\n\nReputation risks also exist. The mis-selling of swaps, over-exposure of municipalities to derivative contracts, and IBOR manipulation are examples of high-profile cases where trading interest rate swaps has led to a loss of reputation and fines by regulators.\n\nHedging XCSs can be complicated and relies on numerical processes of well designed risk models to suggest reliable benchmark trades that mitigate all market risks. The other, aforementioned risks must be hedged using other systematic processes.\n\nThe market-making of XCSs is an involved process involving multiple tasks; curve construction with reference to interbank markets, individual derivative contract pricing, risk management of credit, cash and capital. The cross disciplines required include quantitative analysis and mathematical expertise, disciplined and organized approach towards profits and losses, and coherent psychological and subjective assessment of financial market information and price-taker analysis. The time sensitive nature of markets also creates a pressurized environment. Many tools and techniques have been designed to improve efficiency of market-making in a drive to efficiency and consistency.\n\nIn the 1990s Goldman Sachs and other US banks offered Mexico, currency swaps and loans using Mexican oil reserves as collateral and as a means of payment.\n\nThe collateral of Mexican oil was valued at $23.00 per barrel.\n\nIn May 2011, Charles Munger of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. accused international investment banks of facilitating market abuse by national governments. For example, \"Goldman Sachs helped Greece raise $1 billion of off- balance-sheet funding in 2002 through a currency swap, allowing the government to hide debt.\" Greece had previously succeeded in getting clearance to join the euro on 1 January 2001, in time for the physical launch in 2002, by faking its deficit figures.\n\nCurrency swaps were originally conceived in the 1970s to circumvent foreign exchange controls in the United Kingdom. At that time, UK companies had to pay a premium to borrow in US Dollars. To avoid this, UK companies set up back-to-back loan agreements with US companies wishing to borrow Sterling. While such restrictions on currency exchange have since become rare, savings are still available from back-to-back loans due to comparative advantage.\n\nThe first formal currency swap, as opposed to the then used parallel loans structure, was transacted by Citicorp International Bank for a $US100,000,000 10 year US Dollar Sterling swap between Mobil Oil Corporation and General Electric Corporation Ltd (UK). The concept of the interest rate swap was developed by the Citicorp International Swap unit but cross-currency interest rate swaps were introduced by the World Bank in 1981 to obtain Swiss francs and German marks by exchanging cash flows with IBM. This deal was brokered by Salomon Brothers with a notional amount of $210 million and a term of over ten years.\n\nDuring the global financial crisis of 2008, the currency swap transaction structure was used by the United States Federal Reserve System to establish central bank liquidity swaps. In these, the Federal Reserve and the central bank of a developed or stable emerging economy agree to exchange domestic currencies at the current prevailing market exchange rate & agree to reverse the swap at the same exchange rate at a fixed future date. The aim of central bank liquidity swaps is \"to provide liquidity in U.S. dollars to overseas markets\". While central bank liquidity swaps and currency swaps are structurally the same, currency swaps are commercial transactions driven by comparative advantage, while central bank liquidity swaps are emergency loans of US Dollars to overseas markets, and it is currently unknown whether or not they will be beneficial for the Dollar or the US in the long-term.\n\nThe People's Republic of China has multiple year currency swap agreements of the Renminbi with Argentina, Belarus, Brazil, Hong Kong, Iceland, Indonesia, Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, United Kingdom and Uzbekistan that perform a similar function to central bank liquidity swaps.\n\nSouth Korea and Indonesia signed a won-rupiah currency swap deal worth US$10 billion in October, 2013. The two nations can exchange up to 10.7 trillion won or 115 trillion rupiah for three years. The three-year currency swap could be renewed if both sides agree at the time of expiration. It is anticipated to promote bilateral trade and strengthen financial cooperation for the economic development of the two countries. The arrangement also ensures the settlement of trade in local currency between the two countries even in times of financial stress to support regional financial stability. As of 2013, South Korea imported goods worth $13.2 billion from Indonesia, while its exports reached $11.6 billion. In August 2018, Qatar and Turkey's central banks signed a currency swap agreement to provide liquidity and support for financial stability. \n\nJapan and India signed a currency swap agreement worth US$75 billion in October, 2018, which has been one of the largest bilateral currency swap agreements. \n\n\n\n"}

In 1805, Marsden received the bittersweet news of victory in the Battle of Trafalgar and of the death of Admiral Horatio Nelson in the battle.\n\nMarsden was the son of a Dublin merchant. He was born in Verval, County Wicklow, and educated at Trinity College, Dublin. Upon obtaining a civil service appointment with the East India Company at sixteen years of age, he was sent to Benkulen, Sumatra, in 1771. He was promoted to the position of principal secretary to the government, and acquired a knowledge of the Malay language and the country. After returning to England in 1779, he was awarded the Doctor of Civil Law (D.C.L.) degree by Oxford University in 1780 and published his \"History of Sumatra\" in (1783).\n\nMarsden was elected to membership in the Royal Society in 1783. He had been recommended by James Rennell, Edward Whitaker Gray, John Topham, Alexander Dalrymple, and Charles Blagden.\n\nIn 1795, Marsden was appointed second secretary to the admiralty, later rising to the position of first secretary with a salary of £4,000 per annum. It was in this capacity in 1805 that he received the news of victory in the Battle of Trafalgar and of the death of Admiral Horatio Nelson in the battle. As first secretary he suggested the Marsden squares system for arranging and grouping information over the oceans. He retired in 1807 with a lifetime pension of £1,500 per annum which he subsequently relinquished in 1831. In 1812, he published \"Grammar and Dictionary of the Malay Language\". This was followed by a translation of the \"Travels of Marco Polo\" in 1818.\n\nMarsden was a member of many learned societies, and treasurer and vice-president of the Royal Society. In 1834 he presented his collection of oriental coins to the British Museum and his library of books and Oriental manuscripts to King's College London. His other works are \"Catalogue of Dictionaries, Vocabularies, Grammars and Alphabets\" (1796), \"Numismata orientalia\" (London, 1823–1825), and several papers on Eastern topics in the \"Philosophical Transactions\" and the \"Archaeologia\". \n\nMarsden's \"Numismata orientalia\" opened the field for Asian numismatics in Western languages, and was a \"bible\" for the subject, so much so that a new edition was planned in 1870s, but the field had grown so much by then that the new series was soon renamed as the International Numismata Orientalia.\n\nHe married Elizabeth, the daughter of his friend Sir Charles Wilkins FRS, but there was no issue to this marriage. He died on 6 October 1836 from an apoplexy attack and was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. He left his estate to his kinsman Rev. Canon John Howard Marsden. Elizabeth subsequently married Colonel William Leake FRS on 17 September 1838.\n\n\n"}

The air-oxidised solid is sometimes known as \"green rust\".\n\nIron(II) hydroxide is poorly soluble in water (1.43 × 10 g/L), or 1.59 × 10 mol/L. It precipitates from the reaction of iron(II) and hydroxide salts:\n\nIf the solution is not deoxygenated and the iron reduced, the precipitate can vary in colour starting from green to reddish brown depending on the iron(III) content. Iron(II) ions are easily substituted by iron(III) ions produced by its progressive oxidation.\n\nIt is also easily formed as a by-product of other reactions, a.o., in the synthesis of siderite, an iron carbonate (FeCO), if the crystal growth conditions are imperfectly controlled.\n\nFe(OH) is a layer double hydroxide (LDH).\n\nGreen rust is a recently discovered mineralogical form.

{"id": "2317059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317059", "title": "Cyclic neutropenia", "text": "Cyclic neutropenia\n\nCyclic neutropenia (CyN) is a rare hematologic disorder and form of congenital neutropenia that tends to occur approximately every three weeks and lasting for few days at a time due to changing rates of neutrophil production by the bone marrow. It causes a temporary condition with a low absolute neutrophil count and because the neutrophils make up the majority of circulating white blood cells it makes the body in severe risk to inflammation and infection. In comparison to severe congenital neutropenia, it responds well to treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (filgrastim), which increases the neutrophil count and decreases the severity and frequency of infections.\n\nFirst described in 1910, it was suggested and confirmed to have an autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance in the 1940s and 1960s, but was differentiated from congenital neutropenias until the 1990s when were analyzed pedigrees and identified genetic mutations shared by patients with severe congenital neutropenia.\n\nCyclic neutropenia (CyN), like severe congenital neutropenia (SCN), is a rare disorder. It is considered that in the general population, CyN has a frequency of one in one million. It sporadically occurs as a \"de novo\" mutation variant and/or can be present among members of the same family. It is the result of autosomal dominant mutation in ELANE located on the short arm (p) of chromosome 19 (19p13.3), the gene encoding neutrophil elastase, which is also the most common cause of the SCN. In the case of CyN, the mutation variants have been found to mostly cluster in intron 4 and exon 4 and 5, but were also located in intron 3, and exon 2 and 3. The mutation causes a decrease in the \"neutrophil production or excessive apoptosis (shorter half-life)\" which results in a deficiency of mature neutrophils in the blood.\n\nSome mutation variants have been found in both Cyn and SCN, which indicates they are disease phenotypes with different severity. The expression of the ELANE gene has been linked to GFI1 gene, and it is considered that interaction with other genes causes the emergence and severity of one or the other phenotypic disorder. It is not clear what causes that the levels of secretory leucocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), which influences the induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR), are not diminished and as such activation of UPR is absent in CyN. It is also unclear what causes the cyclic aspect in CyN. According to Donadieu et al. (2011), the \"cyclic aspect ... suggests the existence of a cryptic biological clock that regulates granulopoiesis. This putative clock might be revealed by particular mutations\".\n\nThe common symptoms of neutropenia are recurrent fever, malaise, inflammation of the tissues surrounding the teeth, mouth ulcers, inflammation and bacterial infection of the respiratory tract, digestive tract, skin, and abdominal pain. It is considered that the greatest risk for death is from developing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), peritonitis, bacteremia or Clostridium and Escherichia coli sepsis and septic shock, and pneumonia.\n\nA diagnosis is usually confirmed by monitoring absolute neutrophil (ANC) count three times per week for at least six weeks. The confirmation can be assisted with Lomb periodogram. During the condition, which lasts for three to six days and tends to occur approximately every three weeks (but can range from 14 to 36 days), the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is less than 200-500 cells/microL (<0.2-0.5x10/L), with increase of monocyte counts, and mild oscillations of other cells, including a mild anemia. Between cycles the neutrophil count mostly peaks at subnormal or normal values.\n\nIt is advised genetic testing for mutations in the ELANE and other neutropenia related genes (like HAX1, G6PC3, GFI1 etc.) to differentiate it from other secondary causes or forms of neutropenia. In some cases, intervals and oscillations can be lower and as such it is difficult to determine with ANC analysis if the individual has severe congenital or cyclic neutropenia, but as they can have the same mutation variants in ELANE it is preferable to have both ANC and genetic analysis.\n\nAlthough individuals between cycles are generally healthy and symptoms tend to improve in adulthood, it is advised avoiding activities prone to injuries, to have regular oral and dental care, and BCG vaccine to be avoided. It is advised monitoring white blood cells on some regular basis. The treatment following the symptoms should be immediate to prevent infections, especially during a fever when it requires broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (see febrile neutropenia). The most important and often life-saving treatment is the preventive therapy of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), in the form of filgrastim, which regulates the production of neutrophils within the bone marrow, but shortens the neutropenic cycle and the duration of the severe condition. The subcutaneous injections can be given daily or once every several days, intermittently or timed possibly while monitoring ANC. It is considered to be \"safe and effective\", with no significant adverse effects, besides a possibility of development of osteopenia. The granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is less effective with more adverse effects. Another alternative is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), but is usually practiced in SCN.\n\nThere is a very high risk of life-threatening infections and death at an early age. The quality of life and survival greatly improves with G-CSF treatment, which is practiced since the late 1980s. Unlike severe congenital neutropenia, individuals with cyclic neutropenia have a better response to G-CSF and do not have a risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, in long-term observation of over 300 patients with CyN, there has been one case of developing chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and one of AML, indicating it is also a pre-leukemic condition, but the risk is \"very low\", and the risk is \"correlated with disease severity rather than with occurrence of an ELANE mutation\". According to Donadieu et al. (2011), \"the cumulative risk of experiencing at least one serious (potentially life-threatening) infection by age 20 years is similar in patients with permanent and cyclic neutropenia, although the former patients tend to have earlier manifestations\".\n\n\n"}

The Gathas do not explicitly condemn homosexual acts, although the Südgar Nask commentary on the Gathas dislikes sodomy.\n\nTraditionalist Zoroastrians argue that the Vendidad, one of the books of the Avesta, is an inherent part of Zoroastrian oral tradition even if it was compiled far later than other parts of the Avesta.\n\nThis passage has been interpreted to mean that homosexuality is a form of demon worship, and thus sinful. Ancient commentary on this passage suggests that those engaging in sodomy could be killed without permission from the Dastur, the high priest.\n\nZoroastrianism has been said to have a \"hatred of male anal intercourse\" that is reflected in at least one mythological tale. When Ahriman, the \"Spirit of Aridity and Death\" and \"Lord of Lies\", sought to destroy the world, he engaged in self-sodomy. That caused an \"explosion of evil power\" and resulted in the birth of a host of evil minions.\n\nApart from the Vendidad, the Pahlavi scriptures, later religious Persian books considered sacred by many Zoroastrians, also strongly forbid sodomy.\n\nHowever, many Zoroastrians, eschew this as a distortions of Zoroaster's original message, claiming the rules do not conform with 'Good Words, Good Thoughts and Good Deeds'.

It has since fallen out of favor, along with several of the leaders the term was used for.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, increasingly many Sub-Saharan African countries were holding multiparty elections. The Cold War, the proxy wars of the U.S. and Soviet Union, as well as Apartheid in South Africa, had come to an end. A new generation of African leaders had been anointed who promised to transform their continent. That dream was dubbed the African Renaissance. This concept is often defined in contrast to the big man syndrome - the autocratic rule by the so-called \"big men\" of African politics during the first two decades after independence.\n\nWhen US president Bill Clinton made his African journey in March 1998, he helped popularize this notion when he said he placed hope in a new generation of African leaders devoted to democracy and economic reforms. Although Clinton did not identify the African leaders by name, it is generally assumed that he was referring to, among others, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, Paul Kagame of Rwanda, Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia and Isaias Afewerki of Eritrea. Other leaders were later added that list, including Ghana's Jerry Rawlings, Mozambique's Joaquim Chissano and South Africa's Thabo Mbeki.\n\nIn contrast, the champions of African independence in the 1960s, e.g. Kwame Nkrumah, Julius Nyerere, Patrice Lumumba, Jomo Kenyatta, Kenneth Kaunda, Robert Mugabe, and occasionally the diasporan Pan-Africanists W. E. B. Du Bois and Marcus Garvey - are sometimes called \"the old generation of African leaders\" (in the 1960s they were also called \"new generation of nationalist leaders\" and \"new generation of Pan-Africanists\", and ironically \"new generation of African leaders\").\n\nWith the outbreak of the Second Congo War and the Eritrean-Ethiopian War, in which many of the 'new generation of African leaders' warred against each other, optimism was lost. Furthermore, many of these leaders failed to deliver adequate democracy, peace, and development, and they had an inclination to cling to power.\n\nIn 2010, Ghanaian economist George Ayittey characterized the \"new and angry generation of young African graduates and professionals\" as the \"Cheetah Generation\" who could look at Africa's problems from a fresh perspective, apart from the failed governmental policies of the \"Hippo Generation\" of leaders which were still in a \"1960s-era mentality\". In this, Ayittey saw little difference between the currently-ruling \"new generation of African leaders\" and their predecessors dating from the 1960s.\n\nThe notion of a \"new generation of African leaders\" has also come to mean not only the above named presidents, but also a vision of a new breed of African politicians, civil servants, business leaders etc.\n\nThe similar term \"new generation of black leaders\" is also used, albeit mostly in the context of diasporan Africa.\n\n\n\n"}

It is pale yellow in colour. (The yellow colour is the elastin on the ligaments.) The name is derived from the corruption of \"paxwax\" (originally Old English \"hair\" + \"to grow\").\n\nThe nuchal ligament is unusual in being a ligament with an elastic component, allowing for stretch. Most ligaments are mostly made of highly aligned collagen fibres which do not permit stretching.\n\nStructurally, the nuchal ligament is formed with the association of both elastin proteins as well as type III collagen (45%). The collagen fibrils share a consistent size as well as helical pattern which gives the ligament its tensile strength. The elastin on the other hand is a protein that allows for flexibility. These two elements of the nuchal ligament maintain a complex balance which allows the constant weight bearing of the head along with multidirectional movement without damaging the durability of the ligament through over-use/stretching. \n\nIt is eaten in several countries. It is high in protein (78%) and also contains fat (10%), crude fibre (0.7%), and crude ash (1%). The meat is taken from domestic cattle, the bison, African buffalo, the water buffalo, the yak, and the four-horned and spiral-horned antelopes. \n\nDried paddywhack is commonly packaged and sold as a dog treat.\n\nIt is referred to in the children's nursery rhyme \"This Old Man\", in reference to the fact that the old man is playing the bones; sheep bones.\n\n"}

{"id": "2317099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317099", "title": "Moogerfooger", "text": "Moogerfooger\n\nMoogerfooger is the trademark for a series of analog effects pedals manufactured by Moog Music. There are currently eight different pedals produced; however, one of these models is designed for processing control voltages rather than audio signal. A sixth model, the Analog Delay, was released in a limited edition of 1000 units and has become a collector's item.\n\nAudio moogerfoogers consist of a black wedge-shaped box, approximately , with walnut edges. The face contains an array of knobs, switches and LEDs. All moogerfoogers have a knob that allows the user to fade the effect from a completely dry (100% original input) to a completely wet (100% processed) signal. There is also a stomp switch that allows the user to toggle the effect on and off and a knob that controls the gain. True to the nature of modular synthesizers, all parameters on the pedals are variable using control voltages which may be plugged into the rear of the pedal using 1/4\" jacks.\n\nThe MF-101 is an independent analog low-pass filter. Based on the amplitude of the dry audio signal, an envelope is generated. This envelope alters the filter's cutoff frequency and its amount is variable. Knobs also allow controlling of the filter's frequency (from 20 Hz to 12 kHz) and resonance. The resonance can be increased to the point of self-feedback producing a pitch that follows the filter cutoff frequency. The MF-101 was released by Big Briar (now Moog Music) in 1998.\n\nThe MF-102 is an analog ring modulator. This moogerfooger heterodynes the dry audio signal with a carrier wave that is generated by an internal oscillator. The user can vary the frequency of the carrier oscillator from 0.6 Hz to 4 kHz. The MF-102 also features an independent low frequency oscillator (LFO) that changes the frequency of the carrier oscillator. The user can select the frequency (from 100 mHz to 25 Hz) of the LFO and whether the signal is a square or sine-like (really a triangle) wave. The user can also vary the amount, if any at all, which the LFO affects the carrier frequency. Like the MF-101, the MF-102 was released in 1998.\n\nThe MF-103 is an analog twelve stage phaser. The user can control the \"sweep\" which moves the phaser's frequency response, yielding the classic phaser \"whooshing\" sound. The user can switch to 6-stage mode to produce a subtle change in harmonic response. The user can also control the phaser's resonance, changing the height and sharpness of the phaser's frequency response peaks. Like the MF-102, the MF-103 has an independent LFO, however in this instance it is used to vary the \"sweep\" parameter. In addition to a normal audio output, the MF-103 had 2nd Auxiliary output that was fed by an inverted instance of the Phase shifted signal. By utilizing both outputs in Stereo, some parts of the sound spectrum would be coming from one speaker and other parts would be coming from the other speaker. As the LFO modulates the phaser, the sound takes on a swirling spacial effect. The MF-103 was released in 1999.\n\nThe MF-104 is a completely analog delay. The effect allows the musician a delay time between 40 milliseconds and .8 seconds. However the most remarkable feature is the use of an internal/external feedback loop. The feedback loop from the MF-104 can be routed through another effects processor and back into the delay unit, allowing processing of the echos as they are being generated. As with most analog delay processors, a desirable warmth of sound is created by the increasing natural decay of the original audio signal through the continuation of echoes.\n\nReleased in 2000, the MF-104 was manufactured in a limited edition of 1000 units. A special \"bucket brigade delay chip\" was employed to allow the effect to be completely analog; however, the supply of these chips was limited. The final units were sold in 2001 and the MF-104 Analog Delay remains the most sought-after of the moogerfoogers. In 2005, Moog Music announced the planned re-release of the MF-104, dubbed the MF-104Z. The new pedal will have the same functions as the original, but will feature a longer possible delay time (slightly longer than 1 second). At the same time, the MF-104SD was released in a limited edition of 250 units. The MF-104SD had a maximum delay time of 1.4 seconds, slightly longer than the MF-104Z.\n\nIn June 2012, Moog Music Inc. released the fourth and final version of their Moogerfooger Analog Delay, the MF-104M. The new MF-104M Analog Delay utilizes the same vintage Bucket Brigade chips found in the Classic MF-104. In addition, the MF-104M includes a number of customer requested feature and function upgrades. “We’re very excited about this limited release of the MF-104M,” said Moog Music CEO, Mike Adams. “Many of the parts we use to create these amazing delays are completely original and incredibly hard to find. Since this will be the last of its kind, we have gone to great lengths to incorporate features and functions requested by customers over the last 12 years. The MF-104M delivers those rich, creamy, classic delays Moog is renowned for, but also has the ability to modulate the delay time and create effects not found in any other analog delay.\"\n\nThe MF-104M recreates the sound of the original MF-104. It uses 4 MN3008s, which provide 800ms of analog delay. A new 6 Waveshape LFO significantly expands the sonic capabilities of this Classic Analog Delay. The MF-104M incorporates Spillover Mode, the most popular modification to the Classic MF-104. A Tap Tempo switch lets users quickly tap in delay times or LFO rates, and MIDI capability allows control over every function. The rear panel contains ports for additional pedal inputs, to control other parameters.\n\nMoog Music did release yet another version of the MF-104 called the MF-104MSD which stood for Super Delay. These also had the same modulation features as the 104-M, including the same MIDI control, Tap Tempo, Spillover Mode but like the 104Z they were capable of producing delay times of 1200ms (1.2 seconds). Only 560 MF-104M Super Delays were produced and made available worldwide. An additional very small production run of about 30 units were built for the Gearfest trade show. These had the words 'Super Delay Small Batch' hand-written on the Black painted metal casing rather than the standard silk screened White paint.\n\nBetter known as the MuRF, the MF-105 or Multiple Resonance Filter Array is an original effects processor, designed by Bob Moog in 2004. The MuRF has 8 band-pass filters whose levels are controlled by 8 sliders which resemble a Graphic Equalizer. The filters' center frequencies are set at 200 Hz, 300 Hz, 450 Hz, 675 Hz, 1 kHz, 1.5 kHz, 2.2 kHz and 3.4 kHz and their sliders adjust the gain of each filter. The Bass MuRF or MF-105B, designed for bass guitar players, has slightly lower center frequencies of 110 Hz, 160 Hz, 240 Hz, 350 Hz, 525 Hz, 775 Hz, 1.2 kHz and 1.8 kHz. In addition, the 110 Hz filter was changed to a low-pass filter.\n\nThe gain of each filter is further controlled by an envelope that is triggered by any of a number of preset animation sequences. The user can select one of 24 animation patterns. Rhythmic variations can be created by adjusting the levels of the filters, speed of animation, and envelope amount.\n\nMoog Music upgraded the MF-105 by combining the two units into one box where the user could switch between having the 8 resonant filter sliders to operate either in the range of the MF-105B or the MF-105. This new version also had MIDI control and was released as the MF-105M MIDI MuRF. The unit has two outputs for either Mono or Stereo operation. When both the left and right output jacks are used, the odd-numbered filters are sent to the left channel, and the even-numbered filters are sent to the right channel. This allows for the spreading of a sound’s frequencies between two speakers.\n\nMoog also released Pattern editing software for the MF-105 which users can run on their home computers to create their own Animations that could be loaded into the unit. The MIDI MuRF Pattern Editor is available for download free of charge from Moog Music. It provides easy access to parameters only available through MIDI CC commands. Saving and storing patterns on a computer allows for an unlimited number of available pattern variations.\n\nThe FreqBox or MF-107 was added to the moogerfooger series in early 2007. It was not designed by Bob Moog and it was the first new stomp box to be produced by Moog Music after Bob Moog's death. In general the FreqBox sounds similar to a synthesizer because its interior is actually a VCO that is modified by the input signal.\n\nThe left hand side of the control panel for the FreqBox contains a VCO which has two knobs to control frequency and waveshape. The waveshape is continuously variable from triangle wave to sawtooth wave to square wave to pulse wave. There is a hard sync on/off switch that turns on hard syncing the VCO signal with the input signals frequency. The amplitude of the VCO is controlled by the amplitude of the input signal.\n\nOn the right hand side there are three knobs. A mix knob to mix the level of input signal with the level of the VCO signal, a FM Amount knob that allows the input signal to modulate the VCO with frequency modulation, and an Env. Amount knob that sets an envelope to the frequency modulation.\n\nJune 15, 2011 Moog Music announced the release of the Cluster Flux which was a signal processor that produced flanging and chorusing effects. It had a six-waveform modulation section, a knob that added either positive or negative feedback, a jack for inserting effects into the Feedback Loop, a Tap Tempo switch, a 5 Pin DIN input for MIDI Control and dual outputs for either Mono or Stereo. The Second output had a dip switch configurable for either Stereo out (two\ntypes), Delay only out, or dual Mono out.\n\nThe CP-251 is a control voltage processor that is designed to be used with any of the moogerfoogers or any other audio device that can be manipulated with control voltages. It does not process sound, only the voltages that control the various parameters on other audio equipment. The control voltages act as invisible hands which \"turn\" the knobs and controls on the other gear. The CP-251 has a total of 9 knobs and 24 quarter-inch jacks.\n\nThe CP-251 features an LFO with adjustable rate and square and triangle outputs, a lag processor that can alter the rise and fall of a signal, a multiple jack that passively joins four patchcords together, a white noise generator, two attenuators, a four-way mixer that can combine four signals into one, and a sample and hold. The sample and hold samples a voltage (the noise source) every time a trigger voltage (the square LFO) crosses the threshold. The sampled voltage appears in the output. The user can also use alternate sample and/or trigger voltages to produce desired effects.\n\nNovember 14th, 2012 Moog Music released for a limited amount of time special order White-on-White versions of all the currently available Moogerfoogers which included the MF-101 Lowpass Filter, the MF-102 Ring Modulator, the MF-103 12 Stage Phaser, the MF-104M Analog Delay, the MF-105M MIDI MuRF, the MF-107 FreqBox and the MF-108M Cluster Flux. In comparison to the usual motif of Black painted cases with White lettering for front and rear panel graphics and stain finished wood side panels, these were in striking direct contrast, with White painted cases, Black lettering and graphics and \"White-washed\" wood side panels that were not completely painted over but just enough so that you could still see the wood grain show through. These units all appeared to have stylings characteristic of the spacecrafts that NASA used for Lunar excursions.\n\nIn late March 2005 Moog Music's website announced a new moogerfooger as an April Fool's Day joke. The moogerfooger 4'33\" supposedly had only one button, which would silence any inputs for exactly 4 minutes and 33 seconds. The name and function of the unit was a reference to John Cage's famous composition 4′33″.\n\nIn late March of 2007 Gizmodo.com ran an article announcing the Moogerfooger MF/FM. Pictured was an effect pedal modeled after the classic Moogerfooger design with a linear FM Tuner and a Green rocker switch. The device supposedly was able to lock into FM radio frequencies to create sounds weirder than ever before. The April 1st availability date was a giveaway that this was just another April Fool's Day joke. In theory however, if the device did exist it could have operated as described. The joke alludes to works of 20th Century Music composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, whose compositions Kurzwellen and Hymnen incorporate sounds from Short Wave Radio broadcasts. \n\nOn April 1, 2009 Moog Music's website announced another new moogerfooger as an April Fool's Day joke. The MF-106TC Analog Time Compressor supposedly had the ability to compress the time stream rather than expanding it like a delay pedal, which would then give musicians the ability to hear notes before they actually played them.\n\nAccording to the possibly fictitious Moog Temporal Engineer Amos Gaynes, this was discovered when they accidentally reversed the clock phasing in the time generation on the MF-104Z Analog Delay, and discovered that it can actually work in reverse, compressing the time stream instead of expanding it. According to Moog, however, in a Consumer Product Safety Warning, customers should not attempt to reverse the clock phasing of the time generation circuit on their MF-104Z Delay to mimic the capabilities of the MF-106TC Analog Time Compressor, because without the factory-installed flux capacitor added, a standard MF-104Z will be seriously damaged.\n\nIn 2000, digital effects recording studio Bomb Factory worked with Bob Moog to develop music plugins for Pro Tools based on the MF-101, MF-102, MF-103 and MF-104. The plugins allowed the user to replicate the effects of the moogerfoogers while editing or processing digital audio on their computer.\n\n"}
{"id": "2317100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317100", "title": "Pigtail Ordinance", "text": "Pigtail Ordinance\n\nThe Pigtail Ordinance was an 1873 law intended to force prisoners in San Francisco, California to have their hair cut within an inch of the scalp. It affected Qing Chinese prisoners in particular, as it meant they would have their queue, a waist-long, braided pigtail, cut off. The proposal passed by a narrow margin through the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1873 but was vetoed by the mayor. An identical version of the law, enacted in 1876, was struck down as unconstitutional in 1879. \n\nThe Pigtail Ordinance was proposed as a solution to the overcrowding of jails due to the 1870 Sanitary Ordinance, which was originally meant to prevent unsafe tenement conditions in San Francisco. When in violation of the Sanitary Ordinance, one could either pay a fine or serve a week or more in jail; for thousands of impoverished Chinese immigrants, free room and board was a welcome punishment. Ostensibly to prevent outbreaks of lice and fleas, the Supervisors began requiring that all prisoners' heads be shaved. Many equal rights advocates, however, claimed the Supervisors' true intent was to stem the tide of willing Chinese convicts.\n\nSince the beginning of the Qing Dynasty in 1644, Han men in China had been required adopt Manchu men's hairstyle by wearing the queue and shaving the forehead as a symbol of accepting the Qing dynasty, as Manchu men did. Han Chinese did not object to wearing the queue braid on the back of the head as they traditionally wore all their hair long, but fiercely objected to shaving the forehead so the Qing government exclusively focused on forcing people to shave the forehead rather than wear the braid. Han rebels in the first half of the Qing who objected to Qing hairstyle wore the braid but defied orders to shave the front of the head. One person was executed for refusing to shave the front but he had willingly braided the back of his hair. It was only later westernized revolutionaries, influenced by western hairstyle who began to view the braid as backward and advocated adopting short haired western hairstyles. Han rebels against the Qing like the Taiping even retained their queue braids on the back but the symbol of their rebellion against the Qing was the growing of hair on the front of the head, causing the Qing government to view shaving the front of the head as the primary sign of loyalty to the Qing rather than wearing the braid on the back which did not violate Han customs and which traditional Han did not object to. Koxinga insulted and criticized the Qing hairstyle by referring to the shaven pate looking like a fly. Koxinga and his men objected to shaving when the Qing demanded they shave in exchange for recognizing Koxinga as a feudatory. The Qing demanded that Zheng Jing and his men on Taiwan shave in order to receive recognition as a fiefdom. His men and Ming prince Zhu Shugui fiercely objected to shaving. The majority of Chinese immigrants who moved to America only intended to stay in the United States long enough to make a living and return to China, so they needed to keep their queues to ensure their ability to return. In light of this, the idea behind the institution of the Pigtail Ordinance was that Chinese immigrants would be less likely to ignore the Sanitary Ordinance if such a heavy penalty was the result.\n\nAfter passage through the Board of Supervisors, the order was immediately vetoed by mayor William Alvord. In his veto, the mayor stated that \"this order, though general in its terms, in substance and effect, is a special and degrading punishment inflicted upon the Chinese residents for slight offenses and solely by reason of their alienage and race.\" Instead, enforcement of the anti-tenement law was relaxed. \n\nOn April 3, 1876 the state of California passed their own law to Los Angeles's Sanitary Ordinance. The city no longer had the power to ignore the enforcement of the law, so the board made a second proposal of the Pigtail Ordinance. This time the law passed with a vote of 10-2, and was approved by mayor Andrew Jackson Bryant.\n\nAs a result of the new law, a Chinese immigrant named Ah Kow was arrested for living space violations and had his queue removed at the jail. He sued the sheriff for damages, claiming that the Pigtail Ordinance caused him irreparable harm. On June 14, 1879 United States Supreme Court Justice Stephen Johnson Field, sitting in the local federal court—despite much criticism from the general public—found in favor of the plaintiff; his decision held that it was not within the powers of the Board of Supervisors to set such a discriminatory law and that the ordinance was, in fact, unconstitutional. In particular, he cited the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which guarantees equal protection under the law to all persons within its jurisdiction. See \"Ho Ah Kow v. Nunan\", 12 Fed. Cas. 252 (1879).\n\n"}
{"id": "2317105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317105", "title": "1906 Tour de France", "text": "1906 Tour de France\n\nThe 1906 Tour de France was the fourth of the edition Tour de France, and second to use the point system. Taking place from 4 to 29 July the total race distance was run over 13 stages, with the winner averaging . New in this year were the mountain climbs in the Massif Central. Like its predecessors, it still had cheating and sabotage taking place. Four competitors were disqualified for taking trains as a shortcut and spectators threw nails in the road. However, this did not stop René Pottier from taking a big lead in the first stages. Free of tendinitis that plagued his 1905 chances, he dominated the entire race.\n\nTour organiser Henri Desgrange had been happy with the increased length of the 1905 Tour de France, and decided to put even more stages in the 1906 version.\n\nThe introduction of mountain stages had also been successful, so this year not only the Vosges were included, but also the Massif Central.\n\nThe increased length made it possible to follow the borders of France, and in 1906 the perimeter was closely followed.\n\nThe points system in the 1905 Tour de France had been successful enough in reducing cheating, so the Tour organisers used it again in the 1906 Tour de France, with a few changes: whereas in 1905, time differences still had some effect on the points distribution, in 1906 time differences were unimportant, and points were only given for the order in which the cyclists finished. The winner of the stage received one point, the second rider two points, et cetera. After the eighth stage, only 16 cyclists were remaining, and the results from the first eight stages were recalculated, with only the remaining cyclists, and the points were redistributed among the remaining riders in accordance with their positions in those stages.\n\nThe first stage ended in Lille and the second stage started in Douai; this was the first time that a stage did not start where the previous stage ended.\nAlso for the first time, the Tour went outside France: in the second stage, Germany (Alsace-Lorraine was then part of Germany) was visited, then several days later Italy (Ventimiglia) and Spain (Irun) too.\n\nThe 1906 Tour also saw the introduction of the \"flamme rouge\" (red flame), a red flag that indicates that the cyclists only have one kilometre to go.\n\nThere were 100 cyclists signed up for the race, but only 76 of them came to the start. One of the absentees was Henri Cornet, winner of the 1904 Tour de France. Four cyclists were Belgian, one was Luxembourgian (later winner François Faber), two were German, and the rest were French. Louis Trousselier, winner of the 1905 Tour de France, was present. The riders were not grouped in teams, but some cyclists had the same sponsor, even though they were not allowed to work together. Before the race started, most was expected from Cadolle, Aucouturier, Georget, Pottier, Trousselier, Dortignac and Petit-Breton.\n\nAs in 1905, the cyclists were divided in two categories, the \"coureurs de vitesse\" and the \"coureurs sur machines poinçonnées\", where the riders in the first category were allowed to change bicycles, which could be an advantage in the mountains, where they could use a bicycle with lower gears. In 1905, sponsors had not been so enthusiastic about entering their cyclists in this category, but in 1906 they had learned that it had a commercial advantage to have cyclists starting in the poinçonnées category, because the average French citizen could identify more with them. In 1906, more than half of the cyclists started in the poinçonnées category, including Lucien Petit-Breton, one of the pre-favourites.\n\nAs in previous years, the spectators tried to assist their preferred riders by trying to impede their opponents. On the first stage, nails had been thrown on the road, and all cyclists except Lucien Petit-Breton punctured. This stage was won by Emile Georget in a sprint.\n\nIn the second stage, René Pottier, who had shown his climbing abilities in the previous edition, aimed for the victory. He was stopped after with mechanical failure, and he lost 58 minutes. The other main contenders worked together to stay away from Pottier, but Pottier chased them for , caught them before the finish, and even left them behind, winning the stage with a margin of 1'30\" on Petit-Breton and more than 9 minutes on the rest.\n\nIn the third stage, four cyclists (Julien Gabory, Henri Gauban, Gaston Tuvache and Maurice Carrere) were disqualified for taking the train. The Ballon d'Alsace, which had been the first real mountain in the Tour de France the previous year, was featured again. Just as the year before, it was mounted first by Pottier. The stage was also won by Pottier, more than 45 minutes ahead of the rest.\nPottier also won the fourth stage. In the fifth stage, he was leading by one hour at the halfway point. A cycling legend says that he decided to stop, entered a bar and ordered a bottle of wine, and drank it almost completely. When he saw the first other cyclists passing by, Pottier mounted his bicycle again, went after them, and won the stage. By this point, Pottier was leading the overall classification firmly. The winner of the 1905 Tour de France, Louis Trousselier, had had a bad first half of the Tour, and was many points behind. Trousselier rediscovered his form in the second half of the race, won the 7th, 9th, 10th and 11th stages, and was challenging the second place of Georges Passerieu. Passerieu defended his position by winning the 12th stage. In the last stage, Pottier showed his strength by winning the stage, after finishing together in Paris with Passerieu.\n\nAfter the 13th stage, the race was followed by two timed exhibition laps on the Velodrome in Paris, the result of which was not counted for the overall classification. The winner was Emile Georget, who finished the in 2:07.20.\n\nOne hundred cyclists had entered for the 1906 Tour de France; only 82 of them showed up at the start. Only 49 cyclists finished the first stage, and the number of active cyclists quickly fell to 37 in stage two, 29 in stage three, until 16 after stage eight. At that point, the points given in the first eight stages were redistributed among the remaining riders in accordance with their positions in those stages. At the end of the Tour de France, only 14 cyclists finished. The cyclists were not grouped in teams; some cyclists had the same sponsor, but they were not allowed to work together.\n\nLucien Petit-Breton was the winner of the \"machines poinçonnées\" category.\n\nThe organising newspaper l'Auto named René Pottier the \"meilleur grimpeur\". This unofficial title is the precursor to the mountains classification.\n\nThe Tour organisers did not make many changes the rules or route for the next race, because they had worked in the 1906 Tour de France. The revised points system would be kept in this form until 1911, only to be changed a little bit in 1912 before being replaced by the time system in 1913. The flamme rouge that was introduced in 1906 to indicate the final kilometre of a stage was kept and is still in use.\n\nRené Pottier would not defend his title in the 1907 Tour de France, because he would commit suicide before, after discovering that his wife had had an affair while he was riding the Tour. Petit-Breton and Georget would start again in the 1907 Tour and duel for the overall victory, which would be won by Petit-Breton.\n\nTo honor Pottier's achievements on the Ballon d'Alsace, a monument was placed for him on top of that mountain.\n\n"}

He was stopped for a 5-yard loss.\n\nOn October 10, 2004, when Mare was out with a calf injury, wide receiver Wes Welker replaced him and became only the second player in NFL history to return a kickoff and a punt, kick an extra point and a field goal, and make a tackle in a single game.\n\nDuring the 2005 season, he scored 25 of 30 on field goals, averaged 67.0 yards per kickoff, and had 16 touchbacks in 73 kicks. Mare also recorded his first career fumble recovery during the season on an onside kick.\n\nOn April 3, 2007, the Dolphins traded Mare to the New Orleans Saints for a 2007 sixth-round draft pick. He inherited the position from kicker John Carney, who was released from the team a day after.\n\nHe missed his first field goal attempt of the against the Indianapolis Colts. At the midway point of the 2007 season, Mare had made exactly half of his field goal attempts. He also missed 3 field goals in the final preseason game. Early in the season, it was revealed that Mare injured his groin muscle, and punter Steven Weatherford took over on kick-offs for a few games. While playing the Jacksonville Jaguars, Mare missed his second attempt of the game, and ended up being called on again a few minutes later after the Saints intercepted and drove back into field goal range. Fans booed Mare as he walked onto the field to attempt the long shot (over 50 yards), which he missed. Despite the reaction of fans, and his extremely poor play, head coach Sean Payton continued to stand by the kicker until he was injured in the second game against the Atlanta Falcons, and replaced with Martín Gramática.\n\nOn February 27, 2008, he was released from the Saints after only one season.\n\nOn March 27, 2008, Mare signed with the Seattle Seahawks to a two-year contract worth $3.5 million.\nHe won the kicking battle during training camp and pre-season against Brandon Coutu. He had a superb 2008 season as he finished the season kicking 24/27 field goals and making all of his PATs.\n\nIn 2009, Mare faced significant scrutiny after missing two field goals in a week 3 game against the Chicago Bears. The misses resulted in a 6-point loss for the Seahawks. In a post-game news conference, Head Coach Jim Mora Jr. called Mare's playing \"not acceptable\". Olindo Mare had a fantastic 2009 season as he finished with 24/26 field goals with a franchise record 21 straight. He earned a 2009 Pro Bowl Alternate honor and a franchise tag that will give him a base salary of what the top 5 kickers make in the NFL or a 20% salary increase, whichever is more.\n\nDick Stockton's inability to pronounce Mare's last name correctly has resulted in the nickname Mar-AA. Mar-AA is a reference to a Seattle drinking game.\n\nAfter the Panthers released popular kicker John Kasay, the Panthers were looking for a proven kicker. On July 27, 2011, the Carolina Panthers signed Olindo Mare to a four-year, $12 million contract. However, a year after signing the deal, and after missing two game-winning field goals, the Panthers cut Mare.\n\nOn December 11, 2012, the Bears signed Mare to a one-year deal due to an injury to Robbie Gould. Mare beat out Billy Cundiff and Neil Rackers for the job. Mare played his first game as a Bear on December 16, 2012 against the Green Bay Packers. Mare was successful on both of his field goal attempts but the Bears would go on to lose 21-13. On December 2013, he received a workout with the Lions, but did not make the team.\n\nMare is married to his wife Sandy, with three sons, Hayden, Rylan, and Landon, and one daughter, Kayla. Mare is mentioned in Wale's song \"TV in the Radio\" in the line \"I kick it, kick it like Olindo.\" Mare is a fan of the Italian soccer team Juventus since his father was born in Rota Greca, Calabria.\n\n"}

Classical examples include the crown ethers, calixarenes, porphyrins, and cyclodextrins. Macrocycles describe a large, mature area of chemistry.\n\nThe formation of macrocycles by ring-closure is called macrocylization. Pioneering work was reported for studies on terpenoid macrocycles. The central challenge to macrocyclization is that ring-closing reactions do not favor the formation of large rings. Instead, small rings or polymers tend to form. This kinetic problem can be addressed by using high-dilution reactions, whereby intramolecular processes are favored relative to polymerizations. \n\nSome macrocyclizations are favored using template reactions. Templates are ions, molecules, surfaces etc. that bind and pre-organize compounds, guiding them toward formation of a particular ring size. The crown ethers are often generated in the presence of an alkali metal cation, which organizes the condensing components by complexation. An illustrative macrocyclization is the synthesis of (−)-muscone from (+)-citronellal. The 15-membered ring is generated by ring-closing metathesis.\n\nOne important application are the many macrocyclic antibiotics, the macrolides, e.g. clarithromycin. Many metallocofactors are bound to macrocyclic ligands, which include porphyrins, corrins, and chlorins. These rings arise from multistep biosynthetic processes that also feature macrocycles.\n\nMacrocycles often bind ions and facilitate ion transport across hydrophobic membranes and solvents. The macrocycle envelops the ion with a hydrophobic sheath, which facilitates phase transfer properties. \nMacrocycles are often bioactive and could be useful for drug delivery.\n\n\n\n"}

It is one of the first American films to attempt an even remotely realistic portrayal of a serial killer (although that term was yet to be used).\n\nThe story, set in New Mexico, begins as Jerry Manning (Dennis O'Keefe) hires a leopard as a publicity stunt for his night-club performing girlfriend, Kiki (Jean Brooks). Her rival at the club, Clo-Clo (Margo), not wanting to be upstaged, startles the animal and it escapes the club into the dark night. The owner of the leopard, a solo sideshow performer named Charlie How-Come—billed as \"The Leopard Man\"—begins pestering Manning for money for replacement of the leopard.\n\nSoon a girl is found mauled to death, and Manning and Kiki feel remorse for having unleashed the monster. After attending the girl's funeral, Manning joins a posse that seeks to hunt down the giant cat. Presently another young woman is killed, and Manning begins to suspect that the latest killing is the work of a man who has made the death look like a leopard attack. The leopard's owner, who admits to spells of drunkenness, is unnerved by Manning's theory and begins to doubt his own sanity. He asks the police to lock him up, but while he is in jail another killing occurs: the victim this time is Clo-Clo. Afterward, the leopard is found dead in the countryside, and is judged to have died before at least one of the recent killings. When the human murderer is finally found, he confesses that his compulsion to kill was excited by the first leopard attack.\n\n\nUpon the its initial theatrical release, \"The Leopard Man\" received mixed reviews. \nIn their 1943 review of the film, Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" called the film \"Half-baked\", and wrote, \"\"The Leopard Man\" is nothing but a feeble and obvious attempt to frighten and shock the audience with a few exercises in mayhem.\"\n\nIn the subsequent years, following the film's release, modern critical response has been mostly positive, with many critics praising the film's atmosphere, direction, and suspense. On Rotten Tomatoes, \"The Leopard Man\" holds an approval rating of 89% based on , with a weighted average rating of 7.37/10.\n\nEd Gonzalez of \"Slant Magazine\" awarded the film four out of four stars, praising Tourneur's use of sound and shadows to create tension. Dennis Schwartz of \"Ozus' World Movie Reviews\" rated the film a grade A, writing, \"Tourneur's fast-paced film is armed with a taut and intelligent script, and is one of those memorable films that gets even better with age like a good wine.\"\n\n\"The Leopard Man\" has gradually acquired a cult following over the years, and is now considered a cult classic. It has been included in multiple lists at various media publications as one of the greatest horror films ever made. \"Indiewire\" placed it at #90 in their \"The 100 Greatest Horror Movies of All-Time\". \"Slant Magazine\" listed it at #31 in their \"The 100 Best Horror Movies of All Time\".\n\n\n"}
