It is owned by the Kamloops Airport Authority Society, while operated by Kamloops Airport Limited, serving the North Okanagan, Nicola and Shuswap areas. Initial examination for the airport's construction began in June 1931, when the city leased from fruit-growing company BC Fruitlands.\n\nAlong with an air show presentation, the airport publicly opened on August 5, 1939. It has and runways aligned 04/22 and 09/27, and served approximately 263,290 passengers in 2011. The airfield maintains a restaurant, The Bread Garden, as well as a medical facility, accommodation areas and administrative buildings; food and snacks are also offered. Its terminal, runway and navigation aids were expanded and upgraded by 2009. It has seen one accident throughout its history.\n\nThe airport has daily scheduled flights to 4 destinations in Canada operated by Air Canada Express, Central Mountain Air and WestJet. The terminal handled 312,895 passengers in 2014, an increase of 7.2% over the 290,394 passengers in 2013.\n\nInitial examination for constructing an airport in Kamloops began in June 1931, when the city leased from fruit-growing company BC Fruitlands. The airport's development started in 1936 and the gravel runway completed in 1938. That same year, Kamloops acquired another , as well as land for airport use. The Department of Transport, now known as Transport Canada, granted money for airport development in 1939, with the airfield's runway finishing in that year. On April 13, 1939, an Aeronca aircraft made the first official landing on the runway. The airport was publicly opened on August 5, 1939, along with an air show presented at the structure itself with over 30 aircraft. Later that month, it was classified as a port of entry by the Canadian government. During World War II, additional activity occurred at the airport. In April 1942, Vancouver-based Gilbert Flight School transferred its service to Kamloops, as civil flights provided in British Columbia's Lower Mainland were canceled.\n\nIn addition, the airport was used by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) as an alternate route for the no longer existent Air Transport Command (ATC) for flights to the Soviet Union. During the war Kamloops gained access to for further airport expansion, as well as the addition of taxi and apron services. However, after World War II, part of the airport's land were sold to Canada's Department of Agriculture, with the size reducing to . In May 1944, the Governor General of Canada at that time, Earl of Athlone, entitled the structure Fulton Field, in honor of John Fulton, a Wing Commander server born in Kamloops. This was confirmed by George H. Greer, the secretary of the Kamloops Board of Trade at the time. Throughout its history, a number of airlines have served it. Canadian Pacific Air Lines provided daily flights in 1950 connecting to the communities of Quesnel, Prince George, Williams Lake and Vancouver.\n\nBy 1951, the airport founded and became headquarters of Central British Columbia Airways, which was later known as Pacific Western Airlines, but is no longer existent. However, the following year, its headquarters was transferred to Richmond's Vancouver International Airport. The federal Department of Transport regained rights to the airport in 1961, beginning an expansion program. The airfield saw its runways expand in 1963 and 1964.\n\nIn 1966, Canadian Pacific Air Lines was serving the airport with a Vancouver - Kamloops - Prince George - Fort. St. John - Grande Prairie - Edmonton round trip flight operated with a Douglas DC-6B propliner six days a week and also a Kamloops - Williams Lake - Quesnel - Prince George round trip flown with a Douglas DC-3 six days a week as well with both of these services not operating on Sundays. The first air traffic controllers started working at Kamloops Airport in 1967. That year the airport served approximately 29,200 passengers.\n\nThere had previously been proposals for relocating the airport due to low public visibility during the fall and winter seasons of a specific year. The move was never carried out because another location could not be found. Instead the airport was expanded by 1969. This saw its administrative buildings, offices, baggage area and coffee shop being improved, costing $85,000.\n\nAlso by 1969, jet service had arrived at Kamloops as Pacific Western Airlines had begun nonstop Boeing 737-200 jetliner flights to Vancouver and Calgary with additional nonstop service to Vancouver being operated by the air carrier with Convair 640 turboprop aircraft which the airline called the \"Javelin Jet-Prop\". There was a flood threat close to the airport in 1972, while in the following year, the airfield's runways were extended. Obtaining 149,027 passengers by 1974, more considered the airport reliable, as it was improved with the addition of more general services.\n\nBy 1975, Pacific Western Airlines was operating all flights into the airport with Boeing 727-200 and Boeing 737-200 jetliners with nonstop service to Vancouver, B.C. (YVR) and Calgary, AB (YYC) as well as direct, no change of plane service to other destinations in western Canada.\n\nKamloops Airport's telecommunication equipment was provided at a separate building in 1977, with 235,600 passengers garnered from it that same year. The airport saw the start of its runways and terminals expansion in 1982 and 1984, while the following year this was completed.\n\nIn 1985, Pacific Western was operating all flights from the airport with Boeing 737-200 jetliners with nonstop service to Vancouver, Calgary, Cranbrook, Kelowna and Williams Lake. In addition, the airline was flying direct, no change of plane jet service to Edmonton Municipal Airport (YXD), Prince George, Saskatoon, Penticton and Quesnel with Pacific Western also offering connecting 737 service to Toronto, Winnipeg and Regina via Calgary and as well as connecting 737 service to Victoria and Seattle via Vancouver. According to the April 28, 1985 Pacific Western system timetable, the airline was operating up to seven departures a day with 737 jets from the airport at this time.\n\nDuring 1986 and 1987, the former terminal building was changed to serve as an operation structure. Besides Pacific Western, Air BC and Time Air served the airport with scheduled passenger flights during the 1980s; all three airlines no longer exist. In 1988, the number of passengers dropped to 137,579. The runway has been used by a wide variety of jet and propeller aircraft over the years from Airbus 320, Boeing 727-200, Boeing 737-200, Boeing 737-400, Boeing 737-600, Boeing 737-700 and British Aerospace BAe 146-200 jetliners to Aeroncas, Aero Commander 500s, Cessna 150s and Grumman TBF Avengers since historical dates. A number of different aerial fire fighting airtanker aircraft have also used the airport including the Convair 580, Grumman S-2 Tracker and Lockheed L-188 Electra. On May 20, 2001, a U.S. Air Force C-32, which is a military version of the Boeing 757-200 and is used for U.S. government VIP flights, was present at the airport.\n\nIn 1995, the airport no longer had jet service to either Vancouver or Calgary with these services being operated instead with turboprop aircraft flown by Air BC operating as Air Canada Connector or by Time Air operating as Canadian Airlines Partner via respective code sharing agreements. According to the April 2, 1995 edition of the Official Airline Guide (OAG), both airlines were flying de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 turboprops into the airport at this time with Air BC operating British Aerospace BAe Jetstream 31 commuter propjets as well.\n\nHowever, by 2009, the airport terminal, runway and navigation aids were upgraded with about $25 million, which was funded by the British Columbia government, who gave $4 million, the Canadian government, who gave $6.6 million and the airport itself for the remaining money and announced in 2007; $13 million was used to upgrade the runway, $3 million was used to expand the navigation aid, while $4 million was used for terminal improvements. The city's intention was to expand and upgrade the airport in order for the economy and tourism to expand. City mayor Peter Milobar and members of the Kamloops Indian Band praised its expansion. Its catchment area has a population of approximately 138,000 residents.\n\nKelowna International Airport, an international airport operated in nearby city of Kelowna, has had a small impact on this airport, since they both share the same catchment area. About 13 percent of the local residents in 2007 choose the Kelowna International Airport over the Kamloops Airport to fly to regional destinations, specifically due to its significant growth. Despite this, some Kelowna residents choose the Kamloops Airport over their local airport.\n\nOn 17 May, 2020, a Canadair CT-114 Tutor plane from the Snowbirds, Canada's military flight demonstration squadron, crashed in Kamloops shortly after takeoff, injuring the pilot and killing a passenger.\n\nJohn Fulton is an alumnus of the Class of 1929 at Kamloops Secondary High School. While growing up in Kamloops, John became enamored of flying. For a short while he tried banking, but he had a longing for something more. After only a year he abandoned banking and went down to the Boeing School of Aeronautics in Oakland, California.\n\nHe was attracted to the military way of life and in 1934 travelled to England to join the Royal Air Force. In 1935 he received his commission as a Pilot Officer with a bomber transport squadron. He was deployed to Egypt and stayed there for just over two years.\n\nWith the start of hostilities of World War 2, he came back to England and flew with a bomber squadron. As the pace of operations intensified John flew over twenty missions in three months. In September 1940 he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross then in January 1942 he received the Air Force Cross and in August of the same year he also received the Distinguished Service Order.\n\nWhen the RCAF decided to organize its own 419 Squadron, the first senior officers were Canadians on loan from the RAF. John Fulton was the first Commanding Officer. He enjoyed great popularity among the officers and men of the squadron. Indeed, his Squadron often referred to themselves as \"Moosemen\" after the John’s nickname.\n\nOn the night of August 2, 1942, the Squadron went to Hamburg. On the way home, John’s aircraft was set upon by enemy fighters. A single message was transmitted by the aircraft - \"Wounded … fighters … five hundred feet.\" The aircraft was lost over the sea.\n\nThe high esteem in which the men of No.419 Squadron held their missing leader was demonstrated by the adoption of his nickname as their own thus immortalizing the first commanding officer of \"Moose\" Squadron for all time. No. 419 was the only Canadian squadron to be named after a person.\n\nToday 419 Tactical Fighter (Training) Squadron conducts the NATO Flying Training Canada program for Canada, Denmark, Italy, Singapore and the Royal Air Force at 4 Wing in Cold Lake, Alberta. This program prepares future fighter pilots for training on CF-18 class aircraft. Members of the Squadron continue to refer to themselves as \"Moosemen.\"\n\nOn May 29, 1964, the Kamloops Airport was \"Dedicated in Honour of Wing Commander John Fulton, D.S.O., D.F.C., A.F.C., and the men of the air service from Kamloops and District\" by His Excellency Major General Earl of Athlone K.G. Governor General of Canada. The airport now bears the additional title \"Fulton Field.\"\n\nThe airport is located on 3035 Airport Road in the Brocklehurst neighbourhood of north Kamloops, west northwest of city centre and Selkirk Mountains, situated off Tranquille Road on the Fraser Plateau. It is located north of the Canada–United States border and opposite the Kamloops Golf & Country Club and Kamloops Lake attractions, which is a lake and country club situated in the city. Paid parking, taxis, car rentals and bus service are available. Car rentals are provided by Budget Rent a Car, Enterprise Rent-A-Car and National Car Rental, which have offices located at the airport. There are 389 parking stalls, but 150 more spaces are expected. Due to its location, the airport is commonly used to gain access to Sun Peaks, British Columbia, and Sun Peaks Resort.\n\nFood and snacks are available at this airport's terminal, as well as a medical facility, accommodation areas and administrative buildings. There is a restaurant provided at the airport's terminal, The Bread Garden, as well as Canada Revenue Agency and Nav Canada offices. Its terminal, which is , has been considered for further expansion, with the North Shore Business Improvement Association helping this expansion. The city's intention was to expand and upgrade the airport in order for the economy and tourism to expand. City mayor Peter Milobar and members of the Kamloops Indian Band praised its expansion. The airport's aircraft obtain their fuel from Shell Canada, which is located on site and serves as an aviation dealer for the Kamloops Airport. The airfield has and asphalt runways aligned 04/22 and 09/27, which are appraised every five years.\n\nFormerly known as the Kamloops Aero Club, the Kamloops Flying Club operates at the airport, which is a club where children receive a flight in an airplane with the pilot and learn about the airplanes themselves. In addition, the flight school Canadian Flight Centre is based on site; the branch based in Boundary Bay, Delta opened a location in Kamloops in May 2012 and uses Cessna aircraft for its lessons. Canadian Helicopters operates a training facility for the Kamloops Airport Other related facilities include Astaris Canada, CC Helicopters, Highland Helicopters and WestAir Aviation. Formerly, Flight Discovery operated as a flight school at the airport, but the owner was deemed a fraud artist.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) operates an A-Star helicopter at the airport, while the BC Forest Service occasionally uses the airfield with their helicopters. It maintains an aircraft maintenance centre, while aircraft parts are sold by Inland Communications, Mountainaire Services, Progressive Air Services, Pro Aero Engines, Spring Aviation and Westcan Aircraft Sales & Salvage. Meanwhile, packages can be delivered through FedEx at the Kamloops Airport, while custom and security services are provided by Canada Border Services Agency and Garda Security Screening. There is a radio navigation aid provided at the Kamloops Airport which is used by pilots on aircraft coming from other nearby airports to determine their location. The navigation system is owned by Nav Canada, which operate an air traffic control system at it. The Airside Business Park and Fulton Industrial Park are the airport's development areas.\n\nThe local and upcoming weather of Kamloops is observed at this airport's weather station, referred to as the Kamloops Airport Weather Station. Nav Canada has noted that most of the aircraft winds near the Kamloops Airport blow east and west. It has been classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency. An aircraft at this airport may handle no more than 30 passengers. Skydiving can be performed at the airport through Skydive Kamloops. Passengers may also board a courtesy shuttle to other nearby municipalities, such as Blue River, British Columbia.\n\nIt has a number of employees available, with Fred Legace serving as airport manager and a number of maintenance workers serving the airport; Ed Ratuski also manages it. The Kamloops Airport has been owned by a number of companies since its opening. It was initially owned by the RCAF, but later there was a proposal led the RCAF to transfer airport ownership to Kamloops itself, hence why the name was changed to the Kamloops Airport, although it is commonly referred to as Fulton Field or Fulton Airport. During the 1990s, Transport Canada, the owner at that time, began a program to transfer ownership of selected regional airports and the ownership of the Kamloops Airport was transferred to the then-new Kamloops Airport Authority Society by August 1997 which is a department of the Kamloops City Council and was composed of its members; it was deemed a commercial operation. Kamloops Airport Authority Society have a contract with the Vancouver Airport Authority, which allow them to manage and operate the airport. It is operated by Kamloops Airport Limited.\n\nAs of 2012, the Kamloops Airport offers scheduled flights to the Calgary International Airport and Vancouver International Airport, which are provided by Air Canada Express and operated by Jazz Air. In addition, Central Mountain Air flights are offered to the Prince George Airport, along with WestJet flights, which were added in November 2009, to the Calgary International Airport and Edmonton International Airport; the latter has been serviced since January 2010. All of these flights are provided daily.\n\nKamloops Airport has provided flights to several destinations by charter airlines as well, including the Denver International Airport, San Diego International Airport, San Jose International Airport and Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. In 2010, the airport garnered 36,094 aircraft movements, while in 2012, it served approximately 275,424 passengers, representing a 4.4 percent increase from the 2011 amount of about 263,290 passengers. The majority of this increase occurred in December 2012, which the Canadian Flight Centre contributed to.\n\n\n"}

Consequently, they use organic compounds from the environment to satisfy their carbon requirements; these compounds include carbohydrates, fatty acids, and alcohols. Examples of photoheterotrophic organisms include purple non-sulfur bacteria, green non-sulfur bacteria, and heliobacteria. Recent research has indicated that the oriental hornet and some aphids may be able to use light to supplement their energy supply.\n\nPhotoheterotrophs generate ATP using light, in one of two ways: they use a bacteriochlorophyll-based reaction center, or they use a bacteriorhodopsin. The chlorophyll-based mechanism is similar to that used in photosynthesis, where light excites the molecules in a reaction center and causes a flow of electrons through an electron transport chain (ETS). This flow of electrons through the proteins causes hydrogen ions to be pumped across a membrane. The energy stored in this proton gradient is used to drive ATP synthesis. Unlike in photoautotrophs, the electrons flow only in a cyclic pathway: electrons released from the reaction center flow through the ETS and return to the reaction center. They are not utilized to reduce any organic compounds. Purple non-sulfur bacteria, green non-sulfur bacteria, and heliobacteria are examples of bacteria that carry out this scheme of photoheterotrophy.\n\nOther organisms, including halobacteria and flavobacteria and vibrios have purple-rhodopsin-based proton pumps that supplement their energy supply. The archaeal version is called bacteriorhodopsin, while the eubacterial version is called proteorhodopsin. The pump consists of a single protein bound to a Vitamin A derivative, retinal. The pump may have accessory pigments (e.g., carotenoids) associated with the protein. When light is absorbed by the retinal molecule, the molecule isomerises. This drives the protein to change shape and pump a proton across the membrane. The hydrogen ion gradient can then be used to generate ATP, transport solutes across the membrane, or drive a flagellar motor. One particular flavobacterium cannot reduce carbon dioxide using light, but uses the energy from its rhodopsin system to fix carbon dioxide through anaplerotic fixation. The flavobacterium is still a heterotroph as it needs reduced carbon compounds to live and cannot subsist on only light and CO. It cannot carry out reactions in the form of\nwhere HD may be water, HS or another compound/compounds providing the reducing electrons and protons; the 2D + HO pair represents an oxidized form.\n\nHowever, it can fix carbon in reactions like:\nwhere malate or other useful molecules are otherwise obtained by breaking down other compounds by\nThis method of carbon fixation is useful when reduced carbon compounds are scarce and cannot be wasted as CO during interconversions, but energy is plentiful in the form of sunlight.\n\n\n"}

The party took part in several elections in Poland and Lithuania in the 1920s and 1930s and did not survive the Holocaust.\n\nAccording to the historian Simon Dubnow (1860-1941), Jews are a nation on the spiritual and intellectual level and should strive towards their national and cultural autonomy in the Jewish diaspora (Yiddish \"gales\") in some way a secularized and modernized version of the Council of Four Lands under the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. He said, \"How then should Jewish autonomy assert itself? It must, of course, be in full agreement with the character of the Jewish national idea. Jewry, as a spiritual or cultural nation, cannot in the Diaspora seek territorial or political separatism, but only a social or a national-cultural autonomy.\"\n\nClose to the General Jewish Labour Bund for the emphasis on Yiddish and its culture, it differed from that party by its middle class, craftsmen and intellectual base, but also because of its ideological options. According to Dubnov, Jewish assimilation was not a natural phenomenon and the Jewish political struggle should be centered on a Jewish autonomy based upon community, language and education, and not upon class struggle as advocated by Bundist theorists. It was a liberal party in economic matters, committed to political democracy and secularism.\n\nThe Folkist Ya'akov Ze'ev Latsky (\"Bertoldi\") (former member of the Zionist Socialist Workers Party) was appointed Minister for Jewish Affairs in the Ukrainian People's Republic in April 1918, replacing Fareynikte Moishe Zilberfarb. He was succeeded by Abraham Revutzky of Poale Zion.\n\nA local organization and a newspaper, \"Warszawer Togblat\" (The Warsaw Daily), was set up in Warsaw in 1916 in order to contend for the municipal elections (under German occupation), where they gained 4 seats, including Noach Pryłucki, one of the founders of the party's newspaper, later renamed as 'Der Moment'. He was also elected at the 1919 Constituent Sejm, but had to resign for a citizenship matter. In the 1922-27 Polish Parliament (Sejm) Noach Pryłucki was the only Folkist MP out of 35 Jewish MPs (25 Zionists, but no Bundist). He was elected on the list of the Bloc of National Minorities. The party split in 1927 between the Warsaw branch, led by Pryłucki, and the Vilnius (then a part of Poland) branch, led by Dr. Zemach Shabad, less hostile to Zionism than the Warsaw branch but more Yiddish-centered. After the split the party seems to have declined, with an attempt to revitalize it in Warsaw in 1935. At the 1936 Jewish community elections in Warsaw, the Folkspartei only got 1 seat out of 50, while the Bund got 15.\n\nLawyer and banker Shmuel Landau (also spelled \"Landoi\"), later municipal councillor in Ponevezh (Lit. Panevėžys), was elected (or rather succeeded elected MP Naphtali Friedman, a nonpartisan lawyer, after his death) for the Folkspartei on a common Jewish electoral list (with the Zionist parties and Agudat Israel) at the first elected Lithuanian Parliament (Seimas) in 1920 when there were 6 Jewish parties deputies out of 112.\n\nVilnius (Yiddish \"Vilne\"), where Jews formed the majority of the population, was incorporated into Poland in 1922-1939, and also sent at least one Folkist to the Polish Parliament (Sejm), Zemach Shabad (Szabad)(1864-1935).\n\nThe next elections (1922) were rigged against the Polish and Jewish minorities, but the Seimas was dissolved and another Folkist, the lawyer Oizer Finkelstein (also spelled \"Euser\"), was elected in 1923 on a national minorities bloc. In 1926, a coup d'état took place in Lithuania and the parliament was dissolved in 1927.\n\nThe Folkist newspaper in interwar Lithuania was the \"Folksblat\", published in Kaunas.\n\n\n\n"}

Originally, she was named \"Iris\" until July 1936, but was renamed shortly before her launch.\n\nThe \"Perla\"-class submarines were essentially repeats of the preceding . The modifications that were made compared to the boats of the previous series were mostly of upgrade nature. Among them were enlargement of the false tower at the top, more modern engines, installation of a radiogoniometer that could be controlled from inside the ship. Improvements and the installation of new air conditioning equipment meant a slight increase in displacement, and increase in the fuel stowage also increased the autonomy of these boats compared to the previous series. Their designed full load displacement was surfaced and submerged, but varied somewhat depending on the boat and the builder. The submarines were long, had a beam of and a draft of to .\n\nFor surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft with overall power of . When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the \"Perla\" class had a range of at , submerged, they had a range of at .\n\nThe boats were armed with six internal torpedo tubes, four in the bow and two in the stern. One reload torpedo was carried for each tube, for a total of twelve. They were also armed with one deck gun for combat on the surface. The light anti-aircraft armament consisted of one or two pairs of machine guns.\n\nIn July 1940 \"Iride\" was retained by Decima Flottiglia MAS to be converted into a submarine to carry Siluro a Lenta Corsa (SLC) manned torpedoes. She was fitted with four SLC units, two placed side by side aft, and two on her bow, the submarine's deck gun was also removed to accommodate SLC units and the tower was modified to better adapt for the new role. These SLC cylinders were able to withstand depths up to 30 meters.\n\n\"Iride\" was built by OTO at their shipyard in Muggiano, laid on 3 September 1935, launched on 30 July 1936 and completed on 6 November 1936.\n\nAfter delivery, \"Iride\" was assigned to the 12th Squadron (I Submarine Group) based at La Spezia. After a brief training, in 1937 and 1938 she carried out long endurance cruises in the Dodecanese, Mediterranean Sea and around North African coast.\n\n\"Iride\" secretly participated in the Spanish Civil War, being a part of two incidents that strained Italo-British relations. She carried out a mission from 24 August5 September 1937 under command of Junio Valerio Borghese. On 26 August, \"Iride\" arrived at her designated area between Ibiza and Cape San Antonio. During the patrol she attempted attacks eight times, but only fired on two of those. In the evening of 29 August, she sighted a cargo ship heading towards Valencia, and attacked it twice, second time from , and both were unsuccessful. At 20:45 on 30 August 1937, while traveling on the surface, she sighted British destroyer steaming from Valencia to Gibraltar, and mistaking it for a Spanish naval ship of the , launched a 450 mm torpedo from at 20:52. \"Havock\" managed to avoid the torpedo with a sharp turn to the starboard, and then went on to search for the submarine using her sonar. However, the sonar showed a different position than where the submarine was sighted, and \"Havock\" proceeded to launch depth charges on the sonar location. British destroyers , and , and a cruiser joined in, and continued the attack for nine hours. \"Iride\" hiding at a great depth managed to survive and did not sustain any serious damage. During the attack, she did accidentally surface and was identified by the British as an Italian submarine.\n\nFollowing the incident, in September 1937 the Nyon Conference was called by France and Great Britain to address the \"underwater piracy\" conducted against merchant traffic in the Mediterranean Sea. On 14 September, an agreement was signed establishing British and French patrol zones around Spain (with a total of 60 destroyers and aircraft employed) to counteract aggressive behavior by submarines. Italy was not directly accused, but had to comply with the agreement and suspend the underwater operations.\n\nUnder pressure from Franco's regime, Italy decided to transfer four more submarines (in addition to and already being operated by the Falangists) to the Spanish Legion (\"Legión Española or Tercio de Extranjeros\"). \"Iride\" was one of the four boats chosen for the transfer. On 23 September 1937 \"Iride\" arrived at Soller on Mallorca. She was placed under the direct command of Spanish Admiral Francisco Moreno, was renamed \"Gonzalez Lopez\" and assigned pennant number L3. However, \"Iride\" retained her commander (captain Junio Valerio Borghese), senior officers and Italian crew, but they had to wear Spanish uniforms and insignia.\n\nThe other three Italian submarines transferred to Tercio were (\"Aguilar Tablada\"), (\"General Mola II\") and (\"General Sanjurjo II\"). All four were based at Soller. During her \"legionary\" career \"Iride\" carried out two missions, one in October 1937, leaving on 24 October and returning eight days later, and another one in January 1938, leaving on 14 January 1938 and finishing nine days later. During her second mission, \"Iride\" again patrolled along the Spanish coast, and attempted an attack twice, on 19 January and 22 January 1938, by launching four torpedoes, but both attacks were unsuccessful. In February 1938 she returned home, as Italy withdrew their submarines from Spanish service due to international pressure. \"Iride\" was assigned to 14th Squadron (I Submarine Group) based at La Spezia.\n\nIn 1938 and 1939 she spent time at the Red Sea base of Massawa together with and . She returned to Italy in 1939 and was assigned to 13th Squadron (I Submarine Group) based at La Spezia.\n\nAfter Italy's entrance into the war, \"Iride\" under command of captain Francesco Brunetti on 14 June 1940 was deployed on her first war mission to patrol off Toulon. She returned to La Spezia after a few days without sighting any enemy vessels. During her second mission, on 23 June, \"Iride\" while patrolling in the Gulf of Lion, sighted a ship travelling to Marseille. She launched two torpedoes but failed to hit the target.\n\nIn July 1940 \"Iride\" was chosen for conversion to SLC submarine to attempt the first attack against British naval base in Alexandria. Work was finished in early August, and on 12 August 1940 \"Iride\" departed La Spezia and after a brief stop in Trapani on 16 August, reached the Bay of Menelao in the Gulf of Bomba of the coast of Cyrenaica together with torpedo boat \"Calipso\", which carried the SLC crew, and the support ship \"Monte Gargano\".\nDuring the night of 21 August the SLCs were loaded onto the submarine's deck, and a test navigation were to be carried out the next morning. A reconnaissance plane flew by in the morning of 22 August 1940 and spotted Italian ships in the bay. Around noon three Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers from the aircraft carrier that were temporarily based at Maaten Baggush airfield in the western desert were launched and attacked \"Iride\" and the other ships while they were performing a diving test with four human torpedoes. One of the aircraft released a torpedo from about and after a few seconds \"Iride\" got hit amidships, broke in two, and quickly sank in 15 meters of water, followed shortly by \"Monte Gargano\" which was also hit by a torpedo.\n\nThe flight leader, Captain Oliver Patch, Royal Marines, sank \"Iride\", while John Wellham and Lieutenant Neville Cheesman attacked the other two ships. A few crew members were rescued with the support of the human torpedo operators; most died in the sinking. John Wellham, low on fuel and wounded, returned to his desert base and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Patch received the Distinguished Service Order, while Cheesman, Sub-Lieutenant Frederick Stovin-Bradford and Acting Sub-Lieutenant Gordon Woodley also received the Distinguished Service Cross, and Petty Officer Alfred Marsh the Distinguished Service Medal. Patch and Wellham would later fly in the attack on Italian fleet at Taranto harbour.\n\nWhile examining the wreckage, operators discovered that two non-commissioned officers and seven sailors were still alive trapped in one of the aft compartments of the submarine. The situation was critical: the compartment was slowly flooding and the escape door was jammed distorted by the explosion. After several hours of work, all seven men managed to get to the surface with the help of divers, two men died because they did not follow the instructions. Of the seven survivors two sailors died later of embolism. Overall, \"Iride\" lost 35 men (3 officers, 9 non-officers and 23 sailors) with 17 survivors. All four SLCs were rcovered with minor damage, and brought back to La Spezia by \"Calipso\". The first assault operation had ended in disaster.\n\n\n"}

He returned to England in 1978. He trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London from 1978–80 under Hugh Cruttwell; and with Barbara and Peter Bridgmont at the Chrysalis Theatre School in Balham, London.

Rylance plays Abel and has received unanimous universal acclaim for his performance with many critics claiming it as the best performance of 2015. The \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" quoted, \"As the deeply principled Donovan, Hanks deftly balances earnestness and humor. And Rylance’s spirited performance is almost certain to yield an Oscar nomination.\" David Edelstein from \"New York\" cited 'It's Rylance who keeps \"Bridge of Spies\" standing. He gives a teeny, witty, fabulously non-emotive performance, every line musical and slightly ironic – the irony being his forthright refusal to deceive in a world founded on lies.\" Rylance won the Academy Award, BAFTA Award, and New York Film Critics Circle Award in the Best Supporting Actor categories, as well as receiving Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, among other wins and nominations.\n\nRylance played the title role in Spielberg's \"The BFG\", a film adaptation of the children's book by Roald Dahl.

The declaration named 20 prominent doubters of the past, including Mark Twain, John Gielgud, Charlie Chaplin and actor Leslie Howard (later withdrawn from the list), and was made by the Shakespeare Authorship Coalition duly signed online by 300 people to begin new research. Jacobi and Rylance presented a copy of the document to William Leahy, head of English at Brunel University London. Rylance wrote (co-conceived by John Dove) and starred in \"The BIG Secret Live 'I am Shakespeare' Webcam Daytime Chatroom Show (A comedy of Shakespearean identity crisis)\" which toured England in 2007.\n\nWriter Ben Elton delivered a riposte to this \"batty\" premise in the episode \"If You Prick Us, Do We Not Bleed\" of his television comedy \"Upstart Crow\". The great but \"self-regarding and pretentious\" actor Wolf Hall (played by Ben Miller) joins Burbage's acting company to play Shylock. The character Wolf Hall confronts Shakespeare (played by David Mitchell) with the suggestion that he didn't write his own plays; it is a satirical portrait of Rylance and his opinion.\n\nRylance is married to director, composer and playwright Claire van Kampen, whom he met in 1987 while working on a production of \"The Wandering Jew\" at the National Theatre. They were married in Oxfordshire on 21 December 1989.

It works from the perspective of creating theatre and drama with people affected by substance abuse. It provides theatre interventions in drug and alcohol treatment and general community facilities throughout Britain, as well as producing professional public theatre productions that take place in theatres, studio theatres, and art centres.\n\nRylance has long been an enthusiastic supporter of , which works to change British tax law to allow Conscientious objectors the right to redirect that portion of their taxes which would usually go to the military into non-violent methods of conflict resolution.\n\nIn November 2019, along with other public figures, Rylance signed a letter supporting Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn describing him as \"a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world\" and endorsed him in the 2019 UK general election. In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, he signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party under Corbyn's leadership in the 2019 United Kingdom general election. The letter stated that \"Labour's election manifesto under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership offers a transformative plan that prioritises the needs of people and the planet over private profit and the vested interests of a few.\"\n\nAlong with Rylance's stage performances, he has appeared often at the recreated Shakespeare's Globe in Southwark, London, on the South Bank of the River Thames.\n\nRylance has received numerous nominations and awards for his performances, including wins at the Tony Awards and BAFTA Awards.

He has been described as the greatest Palestinian cartoonist and probably the best-known cartoonist in the Arab world.\n\nHe drew over 40,000 cartoons, which often reflected Palestinian and Arab public opinion and were sharply critical commentaries on Palestinian and Arab politics and political leaders. He is perhaps best known as creator of the character Handala, pictured in his cartoons as a young witness of the satirized policy or event depicted, and who has since become an icon of Palestinian defiance. On 22 July 1987, while outside the London offices of \"al-Qabas\", a Kuwaiti newspaper for which he drew political caricatures, al-Ali was shot in the neck and mortally wounded. Naji al-Ali died five weeks later in Charing Cross Hospital.\n\nNaji al-Ali was born in 1938 or thereabouts in the northern Palestinian village of Al-Shajara, located between Tiberias and Nazareth, which is currently moshav Ilaniya. He lived as an exile in the south of Lebanon with his family after the 1948 Palestinian exodus, the \"Nakba\", and lived in Ain al-Hilweh refugee camp near Sidon, where he attended the Union of Christian Churches school. After graduation, he worked in the orchards of Sidon, then moved to Tripoli where he attended the White Friars' vocational school for two years.\n\nNaji al-Ali then moved to Beirut, where he lived in a tent in Shatila refugee camp and worked in various industrial jobs. In 1957, after qualifying as a car mechanic, he travelled to Saudi Arabia, where he worked for two years.\n\nIn 1959 Naji al-Ali returned to Lebanon, and that year he joined the Arab Nationalist Movement (ANM), but was expelled four times within one year for lack of party discipline. Between 1960 and 1961, along with comrades from the ANM, he published a handwritten political journal \"Al-Sarkha\" ('the scream').\n\nIn 1960, he entered the Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts, but was unable to continue his studies there as he was imprisoned for political reasons soon afterwards. After his release he moved to Tyre, where he worked as a drawing instructor in the Ja'fariya College.\n\nThe writer and political activist Ghassan Kanafani saw some of Naji al-Ali's cartoons on a visit to Ain al-Hilweh and printed the artist's first published drawings along with an accompanying article in Al-Hurriya no. 88 on 25 September 1961.\n\nIn 1963 Naji al-Ali moved to Kuwait, hoping to save money to study art in Cairo or Rome. There he worked as an editor, cartoonist, designer and newspaper producer on the Arab nationalist \"Al-Tali'a\" newspaper. From 1968 on he worked for \"Al-Siyasa\". In the course of these years he returned to Lebanon several times. In 1974 he started working for the Lebanese newspaper \"Al-Safir\", which permitted him to return to Lebanon for a longer period. During the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, he was briefly detained by the occupying forces along with other residents of Ain al-Hilweh. In 1983 he once more moved to Kuwait to work for \"Al-Qabas\" and in 1985 moved to London where he worked for its international edition until his death.\n\nIn 1984 he was described by \"The Guardian\" as \"the nearest thing there is to an Arab public opinion\".\n\nIn his career as a political cartoonist, Naji al-Ali produced over 40,000 drawings. They generally deal with the situation of the Palestinian people, depicting suffering and resistance and harshly criticizing the Israeli state and illegal Israeli occupation, Palestinian leadership, and the Arab regimes. Naji al-Ali was a fierce opponent of any settlement that would not vindicate the Palestinian people's right to all of historic Palestine, and many of his cartoons express this position. Unlike many political cartoonists, specific politicians do not appear in person in his work: as he stated, \"... I have a class outlook, that is why my cartoons take this form. What is important is drawing situations and realities, not drawing presidents and leaders.\"\n\nNaji al-Ali published three books of his cartoons, in 1976, 1983 and 1985, and was preparing another at the time of his death.\n\nIn 1979, Naji al-Ali was elected president of the League of Arab Cartoonists. In 1979 and 1980, he received the first prize in the Arab cartoonists exhibitions held in Damascus. The International Federation of Newspaper Publishers awarded him the \"Golden Pen of Freedom\" posthumously in 1988.\n\nHandala, also known as Handhala (), is the most famous of Naji al-Ali's characters.\nHe is depicted as a ten-year-old boy, and appeared for the first time in \"Al-Siyasa\" in Kuwait in 1969.\nThe figure turned his back to the viewer from the year 1973, and clasped his hands behind his back.\nThe artist explained that the ten-year-old represented his age when forced to leave Palestine and would not grow up until he could return to his homeland; his turned back and clasped hands symbolised the character's rejection of \"outside solutions\". Handala wears ragged clothes and is barefoot, symbolising his allegiance to the poor. In later cartoons, he is actively participating in the action depicted not merely observing it.\n\nHandala became the signature of Naji al-Ali's cartoons and remains an iconic symbol of Palestinian identity and defiance. Handala has also been used as the web mascot of the Iranian green movement. The artist remarked that \"He was the arrow of the compass, pointing steadily towards Palestine. Not just Palestine in geographical terms, but Palestine in its humanitarian sense—the symbol of a just cause, whether it is located in Egypt, Vietnam or South Africa.\"\n\nOther characters in Naji al-Ali's cartoons include a thin, miserable-looking man representing the Palestinian as the defiant victim of Israeli oppression and other hostile forces, and a fat man representing the Arab regimes and Palestinian political leaders who led an easy life and engaged in political compromises which the artist fervently opposed. The motifs of the Crucifixion (representing Palestinian suffering) and stone-throwing (representing the resistance of ordinary Palestinians) are also common in his work.\n\nIt is still not known who opened fire on Naji al-Ali outside the London office of Kuwaiti newspaper \"Al Qabas\" in Ives Street on 22 July 1987, hitting him in the right temple. Naji al-Ali was subsequently taken to hospital and remained in coma until his death on 29 August 1987. Although his will requested that he be buried in Ain al-Hilweh beside his father, this proved impossible to arrange and he was buried in Brookwood Islamic Cemetery outside London. British police arrested Ismail Sowan, a 28-year-old Jerusalem-born Palestinian researcher at Hull University, and found a cache of weapons in his apartment that they said were intended for terrorist attacks around Europe; he was only charged with possession of weapons and explosives. Initially, police said Sawan was a member of the PLO, though that organisation denied any involvement.\n\nSowan later confessed that he worked for both the PLO and the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad. A second suspect arrested by Scotland Yard also said he was a double agent. It was later revealed that Mossad had two double agents working in London-based PLO hit teams and had advance knowledge of the killing. By refusing to pass on the relevant information to their British counterparts, Mossad earned the displeasure of Britain, which retaliated by expelling three Israeli diplomats, one of whom was the embassy attache identified as the handler for the two agents. A furious Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, closed Mossad’s London base in Palace Green, Kensington. The gun used in the murder, a 7.62 Tokarev pistol, was found on the Hallfield Estate in Paddington by police, on 22 April 1989.\n\nForce 17, acting under orders from Yasser Arafat, has also been claimed to be responsible for his assassination.\n\nIn August 2017, detectives relaunched an investigation into his murder case, 30 years after his death.\n\nA statue of Naji al-Ali by the sculptor Charbel Faris was erected at the northern entrance of Ain al-Hilweh camp, where Naji was raised for most of his youth years.\n\nWork on the fiberglass and colored polyester statue (with a steel inner support) took around five months. When finished, it was tall, with an average width of , and average thickness of . The statue holds a rock in its right hand and a booklet of drawings in the left hand.\n\nShortly after being completed, the statue was damaged in an explosion caused by unknown assailants; like al-Ali the statue was shot in the left eye.\n\nThe statue was repaired and re-erected.\n\nA movie was made about the life of Naji al-Ali in Egypt, with the Egyptian actor Nour El-Sherif playing the lead role.\n\n\n"}

He then spent four years at Chievo, helping the Verona neighbourhood club into Serie A for the first time and 5th place and UEFA Cup qualification in their first season at the top. \n\nDelneri left Chievo in 2004 for UEFA Champions League holders Porto, but was dismissed within weeks and before a competitive game. He subsequently managed several Serie A clubs in the following years, including one season with Juventus after taking Sampdoria to fourth place in 2010.\n\nBorn at Aquileia, Udine, Delneri made his professional debut as player at the age of 16 for SPAL, Ferrara's football team, for which he had worked as storer. After playing for Foggia and Novara, he moved to Udinese, with whom he gained promotion to Serie A, Italy's top division. He was later traded to Sampdoria and then to Vicenza, Siena, Pro Gorizia and Opitergina, an amateur team from Oderzo, where he ended his playing career at 34.\n\nAfter his retirement as a player, Delneri stayed at Oderzo, appointed by chairman Ettore Setten (now owner of Treviso) as head coach. In 1986, he signed for Serie D team Pro Gorizia. He then coached Partinicaudace, a minor Sicilian Serie D team, in 1989, Teramo, Ravenna, Novara and Nocerina of Serie C2; with this last team he won the league and promotion to Serie C1. He then moved to Ternana of Serie C2, guiding it to Serie B after two consecutive promotions.\n\nIn 1998, after his second consecutive promotion, Delneri was signed by Serie A's Empoli, but was fired before starting the championship and was subsequently recalled by his former team Ternana in Serie B.\n\nIn 2000, Delneri signed with Chievo of Serie B, a team representing a small quarter of the city of Verona. It was the beginning of the so-called \"Chievo miracle\" in which the team was promoted for the very first time to Serie A, where they topped the league for the first half of the season and then qualified for the UEFA Cup by coming 5th.\n\nIn June 2004, Delneri signed a three-year contract to succeed José Mourinho at UEFA Champions League holders Porto. He was sacked on 7 August, without even managing a competitive game, allegedly for missing training sessions.\n\nDelneri became Roma's third manager of the season in October 2004, after Cesare Prandelli and Rudi Völler. His team failed to advance from their Champions League group, and he dropped young forward Antonio Cassano after a dispute. He resigned from his two-year contract in March 2005, with the team in 7th, and handed the job over to Bruno Conti.\n\nIn June 2005, Delneri signed for Palermo, succeeding Francesco Guidolin who had quit for new challenges after qualifying them for the 2005–06 UEFA Cup. He was fired on 28 January 2006 with the team in 10th after a 3–1 home loss to Siena, having taken them into the knockout stages of the UEFA Cup.\n\nOn 16 October 2006, Delneri returned to coach Chievo, replacing Giuseppe Pillon at the 15th-place club. Despite a strong start, he did not manage to save his side from relegation, losing a spot in the following season's Serie A with a 2–0 loss to Catania on the final matchday.\n\nFollowing the relegation, Delneri was announced as new Atalanta boss in June 2007. He led the team from Bergamo to 9th and 11th place in his two seasons; he announced in April 2009 that he would leave at the end of the season.\n\nDelneri left to take over at Sampdoria on 1 June 2009, a team that had just finished 13th. He guided Sampdoria to a surprising fourth-place finish, and a spot to the third qualifying round of the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League, leaving the next day.\n\nOn 19 May 2010, two days after leaving Sampdoria, Delneri was appointed as coach of Juventus. At the end of the 2010–11 season, having finished 7th and not qualified for Europe, Delneri was sacked by the Juventus board of directors.\n\nOn 22 October 2012, Delneri was named new head coach of tenth-place Genoa in Serie A, succeeding sacked coach Luigi De Canio at Sampdoria's rivals. On 20 January 2013, however, Delneri was himself sacked following a 0–2 home loss to Catania and a string of bad results for the team, which recorded only two wins in his 13 matches with the club.\n\nDelneri was hired at another of his former club's rivals, this time Chievo's adversaries Hellas Verona, replacing Andrea Mandorlini on 1 December 2015; the team had not won once all season. He left by mutual consent after the season ended in relegation for the club on 23 May 2016.\n\nOn 3 October 2016, Delneri signed a one-year deal with the option of a second at Udinese, succeeding Giuseppe Iachini who had won two of seven games. He finished the campaign in 13th, earning a second year, but took 12 points from the first 12 games and lost his job on 21 November 2017 when three points above the relegation places.\n\nAs a manager, Delneri is known for using a spectacular, offensive-minded style of football, which is heavily influenced by Arrigo Sacchi's tactics at Milan, as well as Dutch \"total football\". His teams are known for their work-rate, strength, heavy running, and aggressive use of pressing when defending off the ball, while they are known for their movement off the ball, ability to change positions, and make overlapping runs when attacking. A tactically intelligent manager, his preferred formation is the 4–4–2, which relies on a high defensive line, although he has also been known to adopt other systems which better suit the characteristics of his players, including the 4–3–3.\n\n"}

The auditorium was named in honor of Arthur Hill (1847-1909), who served as a regent of the university from 1901 to 1909. He bequeathed $200,000 to the university for the construction of a venue for lectures, musical performances, and other large productions. Opened in 1913, the auditorium was designed by Albert Kahn and Associates. It was recently renovated by the same firm beginning in 2002 and was re-opened in 2004.\n\nWith seating for up to 3,538 (originally 4,100 prior to the 2004 renovation) audience members, Hill is one of the most popular venues for large productions on campus. The building routinely hosts performances given by the Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra and the School of Music's various ensembles, including the University of Michigan Symphony Orchestra, University of Michigan Philharmonia Orchestra, University of Michigan Concert Band, University of Michigan Symphony Band, and University of Michigan Choirs, as well as the mostly non-major ensembles such as the University of Michigan Arts Chorale, the Campus Symphony Orchestra, Campus Bands, the Michigan Marching Band, and the Men's Glee Club and Women's Glee Club. The auditorium is also host to the Detroit Catholic Central High School and Father Gabriel Richard Ann Arbor graduation each May.\nHill Auditorium's acoustics have been widely praised. The University of Michigan website that describes the recent $33.5 million Hill Auditorium refurbishing and restoration states:\n\n\"When it opened in 1913, Hill Auditorium was hailed as a 'monument to \"perfect\" acoustics.' The excellent acoustics, a result of collaboration by architect Albert Kahn with noted acoustical engineer Hugh Tallant, are known world-wide and have made the auditorium a favorite venue for legions of famous musicians and other artists, as well as numerous noted speakers.\"\n\n\"Careful attention will be given throughout the renovation to maintaining the acoustic quality of Hill, said Henry Baier, associate vice president for facilities and operations. In addition, further work will be done to reduce street and lobby noise by building a “sound lock” between the lobby and the auditorium.\"\n\nMichigan's University Musical Society presents performances of many world-renowned artists at Hill Auditorium.\n\nThe hall's unique oval-shaped stage has seen performances by Rachmaninoff, Prokofiev, the Denishawn Dance Company, the Vienna Philharmonic,the Berlin Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony, the Chicago Symphony, the Cleveland Orchestra, New York Philharmonic, London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Leningrad Philharmonic, the Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia, the Lahti Symphony Orchestra, Jan Kubelik, Jascha Heifetz, Fritz Kreisler, Carl Flesch, Eugene Ysaye, Efrem Zimbalist, Myra Hess, Ravi Shankar, Anne Sofie von Otter, Audra McDonald, the Kremerata Baltica, the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, Emilia Parks Butryn, the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, Enrico Caruso, Joan Sutherland, Robert Frost, Jessye Norman, Van Cliburn, Yo-Yo Ma, Vladimir Horowitz, Helen Hayes, Cecilia Bartoli, Eugene Ormandy, Leonard Bernstein, Isaac Stern, Benny Goodman, Harry Chapin, Dave Brubeck, Jack DeJohnette, the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, Alexander Frey, Louis Lortie, the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra, Wynton Marsalis, George Winston, Elton John, the Grateful Dead, Brandi Carlile, Rufus Wainwright, I'm With Her, and Lupe Fiasco among others.\n\nCarol Rose Kahn, the architect’s granddaughter recounted that her grandfather had set out to develop a hall with perfect acoustics. The brief was to design an auditorium that would seat five thousand people, where they could hear from every seat. The only known previous example was the Mormon Tabernacle where, it was said that one could hear a pin drop from the stage to the top balcony, although the chamber suffered from excess reverberation.\n\nBeing aware that only one man in the country who was pre-eminent at that time – Hugh Tallant, partner of Henry Beaumont Herts – Kahn wrote to ask him if it would be possible to build an auditorium for five thousand people, where they'd hear from every seat. Tallant responded, but only after several months had elapsed, to the affirmative; so Tallant designed the acoustics. The result was an auditorium in the shape of a megaphone. The granddaughter said: \"Hill Auditorium was nearly finished when I was fourteen or so. My father and I went out to Ann Arbor. Father stood up in the last seat of the second balcony, and I went down on the stage. On my word of honor, I dropped a pin and he heard it.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2227456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227456", "title": "Alive II", "text": "Alive II\n\nAlive II is the second live album (and eighth overall) by American hard rock band Kiss, released on October 14, 1977 by Casablanca Records. The band had released three albums (\"Destroyer\", \"Rock and Roll Over\", and \"Love Gun\") since the previous live outing, the 1975 release \"Alive!\", so they drew upon the variety of new tracks, with Eddie Kramer producing.\n\nThe origins of \"Alive II\" go back to early 1977 when the band's manager Bill Aucoin suggested that Kramer record a live album during the evening show at Budokan Hall in Tokyo, Japan on April 2, 1977. The plan was to release a live album to give Kiss some much deserved time off before recording the album that would become \"Love Gun\" later that autumn. Kramer finished work on the album, but Casablanca and Kiss deemed it unusable, and the band forged ahead with their \"Love Gun\" sessions.\n\nMost of the live tracks on \"Alive II\" were recorded during the band's August 26–28 shows at the Forum while on their Love Gun Tour. The 3 p.m. soundchecks at the August 26 and 27 shows were recorded, and later used on the album (i.e. \"I Stole Your Love\" with crowd noise being dubbed in later). \"Beth\" and \"I Want You\" were lifted from the aborted Japanese live album and used on the finished \"Alive II\". As the band did not want to duplicate songs included on \"Alive!\", the songs chosen for the three live sides of the album were all drawn from Kiss' three preceding studio albums: \"Destroyer\", \"Rock and Roll Over\" and \"Love Gun\".\n\nOn the original double album, the songs on side 4 (tracks 6–10 on the second CD) are studio tracks recorded September 13–16, 1977. Although Ace Frehley was originally credited for lead guitar on the studio tracks, the remastered version released in 1997 confirmed what had been speculated by Kiss fans for years: Bob Kulick actually played lead guitar on three tracks (\"All American Man\", \"Rockin' in the U.S.A.\" and \"Larger Than Life\"), not Frehley. Frehley's sole involvement for the studio songs was \"Rocket Ride\" (originally written for a solo album), on which he sang lead vocals and played both guitar and bass guitar. Paul Stanley played all guitars on \"Any Way You Want It\", which was originally recorded by the Dave Clark Five in 1964.\n\nSeveral early copies of the album's cover featured a rare misprint of three additional songs (\"Take Me\", \"Hooligan\" and \"Do You Love Me?\") with a slightly altered song order. None of these additional songs appeared on the LP. On the misprint, \"Take Me\" is after \"Detroit Rock City\", with \"King of the Night Time World\" appearing after \"Ladies Room\" on Side 1. Side two features \"Hooligan\" after \"Shock Me\", which is placed after \"Hard Luck Woman\". On Side 3, \"Do You Love Me?\" appears after \"God of Thunder\", with \"Beth\" sandwiched between \"I Want You\" and \"Shout It Out Loud\". \"Hooligan\" and \"Take Me\" were performed on the 1977 \"Love Gun\" tour, and \"Do You Love Me?\" was performed on the Japanese tour that same year, making their consideration for inclusion with the second live album possible.\n\nThe original vinyl issue of \"Alive II\" was a 2-LP set with a gatefold cover and picture inner sleeves. Continuing the Kiss tradition of including promotional items with their albums, \"Alive II\" was packaged with a full-color booklet titled \"The Evolution of Kiss\" and a set of temporary transfer tattoos in a cartoon style. The tattoos depicted the band logo, Kiss Army logo, band member heads, member signatures and symbols. The symbols were meant to represent the four personas of the group and included a skull and crossbones for Gene Simmons, a rose and star with eye for Stanley, a Saturn-like planet and block print-style \"ACE\" for Frehley, and a drum and cat's head for Peter Criss. The rose and \"ACE\" are copies of Stanley and Frehley's actual tattoos, respectively. A merchandise order form was also included with the album, listing an array of official Kiss merchandise as well as a chance to \"enlist\" in the Kiss Army. The inner sleeves depicted crazed Kiss fans in a confetti storm and the band's album discography to date.\n\n\"Alive II\" was originally reissued as a double-CD set in what has now become known as a \"fatboy\" 2CD case. When the Kiss back catalog was remastered, it was housed in a slimline 2CD case and, in keeping with the rest of the reissue program, had the artwork restored. This included the set of tattoos. The booklet \"The Evolution of Kiss\"' and the picture inner sleeves were incorporated as part of the CD booklet. \"Alive II\" was re-released in 2006 as part of \"Kiss Alive! 1975-2000\". It included \"Rock and Roll All Nite\" (single edit version) as a bonus track. The short running time of \"Alive II\" allowed for a single CD edition in the latest release.\n\nComing off of a period of extensive touring, \"Alive II\" received a huge fan response and critical acclaim, reaching the No. 7 spot on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. The album has received praise from several critics. In a retrospective review, critic Greg Parto of AllMusic remarked that several tracks such as \"Detroit Rock City\", \"Shock Me\" and \"Shout It Out Loud\" featured an \"adrenaline-charged\" vibe. He lauded the album for showing the group in its element as an \"exciting live band\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2227469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227469", "title": "Lake retention time", "text": "Lake retention time\n\nLake retention time (also called the residence time of lake water, or the water age or flushing time) is a calculated quantity expressing the mean time that water (or some dissolved substance) spends in a particular lake. At its simplest, this figure is the result of dividing the lake volume by the flow in or out of the lake. It roughly expresses the amount of time taken for a substance introduced into a lake to flow out of it again. The retention time is especially important where pollutants are concerned.\n\nThe global retention time for a lake (the overall mean time that water spends in the lake) is calculated by dividing the lake volume by either the mean rate of inflow of all tributaries, or by the mean rate of outflow (ideally including evaporation and seepage). This metric assumes that water in the lake is well-mixed (rather than stratified), so that any portion of the lake water is much like any other. In reality, larger and deeper lakes are generally not well-mixed. Many large lakes can be divided into distinct portions with only limited flow between them. Deep lakes are generally stratified, with deeper water mixing infrequently with surface water. These are often better modeled as several distinct sub-volumes of water.\n\nIt is possible to calculate more specific residence time figures for a particular lake, such as individual residence times for sub-volumes (e.g. particular arms), or a residence time distribution for the various layers of a stratified lake. These figures can often better express the hydrodynamics of the lake. However, any such approach remains a simplification and must be guided by an understanding of the processes operating in the lake.\n\nTwo approaches can be used (often in combination) to elucidate how a particular lake works: field measurements and mathematical modeling. One common technique for field measurement is to introduce a tracer into the lake and monitor its movement. This can be a solid tracer, such as a float constructed to be neutrally buoyant within a particular water layer, or sometimes a liquid. This approach is sometimes referred to as using a Lagrangian reference frame. Another field measurement approach, using an Eulerian reference frame, is to capture various properties of the lake water (including mass movement, water temperature, electrical conductivity and levels of dissolved substances, typically oxygen) at various fixed positions in the lake. From these can be constructed an understanding of the dominant processes operating in the various parts of the lake and their range and duration.\n\nField measurements alone are usually not a reliable basis for generating residence times, mainly because they necessarily represent a small subset of locations and conditions. Therefore, the measurements are generally used as the input for numerical models. In theory it would be possible to integrate a system of hydrodynamic equations with variable boundary conditions over a very long period sufficient for inflowing water particles to exit the lake. One could then calculate the traveling times of the particles using a Lagrangian method. However, this approach exceeds the detail available in current hydrodynamic models and the capacity of current computer resources. Instead, residence time models developed for gas and fluid dynamics, chemical engineering, and bio-hydrodynamics can be adapted to generate residence times for sub-volumes of lakes.\n\n\"The residence time listed is taken from the infobox in the associated article unless otherwise specified.\"\n\n"}

Prior to that, Baku played 18 seasons in the Azerbaijan Premier League, winning the championship twice and earning the National Cup three times.\n\nLed by Shamil Heydarov, Dinamo finished 2nd and entered UEFA Cup 1998-99 season but was eliminated by Argeş Piteşti, 1:7 on aggregate, in Preliminary round. 1997–98 season Dinamo participated with new head coach. Under the manage of Ruslan Abdullayev, the team passed the first part of tournament distance well, although 3rd place and 52 points were not enough for medals or European cups, and Dinamo completed the season at 6th place. Two following season Dinamo also finished 6th, but since 2000, the team was managed by Ruslan Abdullayev's son Elkhan Abdullayev, and was renamed into Dinamo Bakılı. In 2001–02 season, after a disastrous performance, Dinamo Bakılı relegated to Azerbaijan First Division, but due to conflict between clubs and the AFFA next championship was held just two years later, in which the team participated under the name of Dinamo, last time in its history.\n\nIn 2004, club renamed to the \"FC Baku\", after changes by the new chairman. New management began from radical changes. Elkhan Abdullayev was replaced by Asgar Abdullayev immediately after the first defeat on second week. Azerbaijan national football team former manager was able to establish the team playing style. FC Baku gained some important victories over the opponents and was holding a pole position until February 2005. At the end of the season Asgar Abdullayev concentrated on Azerbaijan Cup, where his team reached the Final game. In 2004–05 season, Baku managed to finish at 5th position.\n\nBut the returning to European cups proved unsuccessful. In UEFA Cup 2004-05 season first qualifying match, Baku was beaten by Slovakian side MŠK Žilina, 2–3 on aggregate, although they won a first leg in Baku, 1–0.\nIn 2008, after poor first season, the club celebrated their second title with Gjoko Hadžievski. Under his charge, FC Baku became the first Azerbaijani team to qualify to the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League. The team passed Ekranas in the second qualifying round after 2–2 in Lithuania and 4–2 win in Tofik Bakhramov Stadium in the second leg.\n\nIn 2010, the club was handed a two-match suspension by UEFA for fielding Joël Epalle, who was ineligible to play at the time despite winning both legs against Budućnost.\n\nA long period of decline followed the success of the 2008 to the end of the decade. Despite the appointment of famous names such as Bülent Korkmaz, Winfried Schäfer, Aleksandrs Starkovs, Božidar Bandović and Milinko Pantić, the club did not achieve any success and squandered large sums of money on unsuccessful signings.\n\nIn 2014, the club owner Hafiz Mammadov's financial difficulties forced number of players and personnel to seek new clubs, leaving club's future uncertain. The club was eliminated from the Premier League during the 2014-15 season. In 2015-16 season the team played in the Azerbaijani First Division, and became defunct as a professional club the next year.\n\nThe club's traditional kit is a white and blue shirt, white shorts with grey socks. Their away kit is all maroon. Baku's kits are manufactured by Macron. The club sponsored by the Baghlan Group and ZQAN Holding. The club's logo is based on The Maiden Tower, a noted landmark and one of Azerbaijan's most distinctive emblems.\n\nTofik Bakhramov Stadium was used for long period of time as Baku's main stadium. In 2008, Baku's president Hafiz Mammadov announced that a new stadium which will have a capacity of 10,000 fans will be built. The new stadium was expected to be finish 2010, but construction is currently on hold.\n\nThe club's training base is currently used for its domestic games, which holds 2,000 fans.\n\nThe club enjoys support from fans scattered all over the city, and the local area in general. The club has been the subject of an independent supporters' fanzine \"Toplu Bakı\" since the 2010s.\n\n\"As of 21 July 2009.\"\n\nThe following managers have all won at least one trophy when in charge of FC Baku:\n\n\n"}

Data of recursive types are usually viewed as directed graphs.\n\nAn important application of recursion in computer science is in defining dynamic data structures such as Lists and Trees. Recursive data structures can dynamically grow to an arbitrarily large size in response to runtime requirements; in contrast, a static array's size requirements must be set at compile time.\n\nSometimes the term \"inductive data type\" is used for algebraic data types which are not necessarily recursive.\n\nAn example is the list type, in Haskell:\ndata List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)\nThis indicates that a list of a's is either an empty list or a cons cell containing an 'a' (the \"head\" of the list) and another list (the \"tail\").\n\nAnother example is a similar singly linked type in Java:\nclass List<E> {\n\nThis indicates that non-empty list of type E contains a data member of type E, and a reference to another List object for the rest of the list (or a null reference to indicate that this is the end of the list).\n\nData types can also be defined by mutual recursion. The most important basic example of this is a tree, which can be defined mutually recursively in terms of a forest (a list of trees). Symbolically:\nA forest \"f\" consists of a list of trees, while a tree \"t\" consists of a pair of a value \"v\" and a forest \"f\" (its children). This definition is elegant and easy to work with abstractly (such as when proving theorems about properties of trees), as it expresses a tree in simple terms: a list of one type, and a pair of two types.\n\nThis mutually recursive definition can be converted to a singly recursive definition by inlining the definition of a forest:\nA tree \"t\" consists of a pair of a value \"v\" and a list of trees (its children). This definition is more compact, but somewhat messier: a tree consists of a pair of one type and a list another, which require disentangling to prove results about.\n\nIn Standard ML, the tree and forest data types can be mutually recursively defined as follows, allowing empty trees:\n\ndatatype 'a tree = Empty | Node of 'a * 'a forest\nand 'a forest = Nil | Cons of 'a tree * 'a forest\nIn Haskell, the tree and forest data types can be defined similarly:\ndata Tree a = Empty\n\ndata Forest a = Nil\nIn type theory, a recursive type has the general form μα.T where the type variable α may appear in the type T and stands for the entire type itself.\n\nFor example, the natural numbers (see Peano arithmetic) may be defined by the Haskell datatype:\ndata Nat = Zero | Succ Nat\nIn type theory, we would say: formula_1 where the two arms of the sum type represent the Zero and Succ data constructors. Zero takes no arguments (thus represented by the unit type) and Succ takes another Nat (thus another element of formula_2).\n\nThere are two forms of recursive types: the so-called isorecursive types, and equirecursive types. The two forms differ in how terms of a recursive type are introduced and eliminated.\n\nWith isorecursive types, the recursive type formula_3 and its expansion (or \"unrolling\") formula_4 (Where the notationformula_5 indicates that all instances of Z are replaced with Y in X) are distinct (and disjoint) types with special term constructs, usually called \"roll\" and \"unroll\", that form an isomorphism between them. To be precise: formula_6 and formula_7, and these two are inverse functions.\n\nUnder equirecursive rules, a recursive type formula_3 and its unrolling formula_9 are \"equal\" -- that is, those two type expressions are understood to denote the same type. In fact, most theories of equirecursive types go further and essentially specify that any two type expressions with the same \"infinite expansion\" are equivalent. As a result of these rules, equirecursive types contribute significantly more complexity to a type system than isorecursive types do. Algorithmic problems such as type checking and type inference are more difficult for equirecursive types as well. Since direct comparison does not make sense on an equirecursive type, they can be converted into a canonical form in O(n log n) time, which can easily be compared.\n\nEquirecursive types capture the form of self-referential (or mutually referential) type definitions seen in procedural and object-oriented programming languages, and also arise in type-theoretic semantics of objects and classes.\nIn functional programming languages, isorecursive types (in the guise of datatypes) are far more common.\n\nRecursion is not allowed in type synonyms in Miranda, OCaml (unless -rectypes flag is used or it's a record or variant), and Haskell; so for example the following Haskell types are illegal:\ntype Bad = (Int, Bad)\ntype Evil = Bool -> Evil\nInstead, you must wrap it inside an algebraic data type (even if it only has one constructor):\ndata Good = Pair Int Good\ndata Fine = Fun (Bool -> Fine)\nThis is because type synonyms, like typedefs in C, are replaced with their definition at compile time. (Type synonyms are not \"real\" types; they are just \"aliases\" for convenience of the programmer.) But if you try to do this with a recursive type, it will loop infinitely because no matter how many times you substitute it, it still refers to itself, e.g. \"Bad\" will grow indefinitely: codice_1 → codice_2 → codice_3 → codice_4 .\n\nAnother way to see it is that a level of indirection (the algebraic data type) is required to allow the isorecursive type system to figure out when to \"roll\" and \"unroll\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2227503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227503", "title": "Langmuir–Blodgett film", "text": "Langmuir–Blodgett film\n\nA Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) film is a nanostructured system formed when Langmuir films—or Langmuir monolayers (LM)—are transferred from the liquid-gas interface to solid supports during the vertical passage of the support through the monolayers. LB films can contain one or more monolayers of an organic material, deposited from the surface of a liquid onto a solid by immersing (or emersing) the solid substrate into (or from) the liquid. A monolayer is adsorbed homogeneously with each immersion or emersion step, thus films with very accurate thickness can be formed. This thickness is accurate because the thickness of each monolayer is known and can therefore be added to find the total thickness of a Langmuir–Blodgett film.\n\nThe monolayers are assembled vertically and are usually composed either of amphiphilic molecules (see Chemical polarity) with a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail (example: fatty acids) or nowadays commonly of nanoparticles.\n\nLangmuir–Blodgett films are named after Irving Langmuir and Katharine B. Blodgett, who invented this technique while working in Research and Development for General Electric Co. \n\nAdvances to the discovery of LB and LM films began with Benjamin Franklin in 1773 when he dropped about a teaspoon of oil onto a pond. Franklin noticed that the waves were calmed almost instantly and that the calming of the waves spread for about half an acre. What Franklin did not realize was that the oil had formed a monolayer on top of the pond surface. Over a century later, Lord Rayleigh quantified what Benjamin Franklin had seen. Knowing that the oil, oleic acid, had spread evenly over the water, Rayleigh calculated that the thickness of the film was 1.6 nm by knowing the volume of oil dropped and the area of coverage.\n\nWith the help of her kitchen sink, Agnes Pockels showed that area of films can be controlled with barriers. She added that surface tension varies with contamination of water. She used different oils to deduce that surface pressure would not change until area was confined to about 0.2 nm. This work was originally written as a letter to Lord Rayleigh who then helped Agnes Pockels become published in the journal, \"Nature\", in 1891.Agnes Pockels’ work set the stage for Irving Langmuir who continued to work and confirmed Pockels’ results. Using Pockels’ idea, he developed the Langmuir (or Langmuir–Blodgett) trough. His observations indicated that chain length did not impact the affected area since the organic molecules were arranged vertically.\n\nLangmuir’s breakthrough did not occur until he hired Katherine Blodgett as his assistant. Blodgett initially went to seek for a job at General Electric (GE) with Langmuir during her Christmas break of her senior year at Bryn Mawr College, where she received a BA in Physics. Langmuir advised to Blodgett that she should continue her education before working for him. She thereafter attended University of Chicago for her MA in Chemistry. Upon her completion of her Master's, Langmuir hired her as his assistant. However, breakthroughs in surface chemistry happened after she received her PhD degree in 1926 from Cambridge University.\n\nWhile working for GE, Langmuir and Blodgett discovered that when a solid surface is inserted into an aqueous solution containing organic moieties, the organic molecules will deposit a monolayer homogeneously over the surface. This is the Langmuir–Blodgett film deposition process. Through this work in surface chemistry and with the help of Blodgett, Langmuir was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1932. In addition, Blodgett used Langmuir–Blodgett film to create 99% transparent anti-reflective glass by coating glass with fluorinated organic compounds, forming a simple anti-reflective coating.\n\nLangmuir films are formed when amphiphilic (surfactants) molecules or nanoparticles are spread on the air at an air–water interface. Surfactants (or surface-acting agents) are molecules with hydrophobic 'tails' and hydrophilic 'heads'. When surfactant concentration is less than the minimum surface concentration of collapse and it is completely insoluble in water , the surfactant molecules arrange themselves as shown in Figure 1 below. This tendency can be explained by surface-energy considerations. Since the tails are hydrophobic, their exposure to air is favoured over that to water. Similarly, since the heads are hydrophilic, the head–water interaction is more favourable than air–water interaction. The overall effect is reduction in the surface energy (or equivalently, surface tension of water).\n\n<br> Figure 1: Surfactant molecules arranged on an air–water interface\n\nFor very small concentrations, far from the surface density compatible with the collapse of the monolayer (which leads to polylayers structures) the surfactant molecules execute a random motion on the water–air interface. This motion can be thought to be similar to the motion of ideal-gas molecules enclosed in a container. The corresponding thermodynamic variables for the surfactant system are, surface pressure (formula_1), surface area (A) and number of surfactant molecules (N). This system behaves similar to a gas in a container. The density of surfactant molecules as well as the surface pressure increases upon reducing the surface area A ('compression' of the 'gas'). Further compression of the surfactant molecules on the surface shows behavior similar to phase transitions. The ‘gas’ gets compressed into ‘liquid’ and ultimately into a perfectly closed packed array of the surfactant molecules on the surface corresponding to a ‘solid’ state. The liquid state is usually separated in the liquid-expanded and liquid-condensed states. All the Langmuir film states are classified according to the compressionality factor of the films, defined as -A(d (formula_1)/dA), usually related to the in-plane elasticity of the monolayer. \n\nThe condensed Langmuir films (in surface pressures usually higher than 15 mN/m – typically 30 mN/m) can be subsequently transferred onto a solid substrate to create highly organized thin film coatings. Langmuir–Blodgett troughs \n\nBesides LB film from surfactants depicted in Figure 1, similar monolayers can also be made from inorganic nanoparticles.\n\nAdding a monolayer to the surface reduces the surface tension, and the surface pressure, formula_1 is given by the following equation:\n\nwhere formula_5 is equal to the surface tension of the water and formula_6 is the surface tension due to the monolayer. But the concentration-dependence of surface tension (similar to Langmuir isotherm) is as follows:\n\nThus,\n\nor\n\nThe last equation indicates a relationship similar to ideal gas law. However, the concentration-dependence of surface tension is valid only when the solutions are dilute and concentrations are low. Hence, at very low concentrations of the surfactant, the molecules behave like ideal gas molecules.\n\nExperimentally, the surface pressure is usually measured using the Wilhelmy plate. A pressure sensor/electrobalance arrangement detects the pressure exerted by the monolayer. Also monitored is the area to the side of the barrier which the monolayer resides.\n\nFigure 2. A Wilhelmy plate\n\nA simple force balance on the plate leads to the following equation for the surface pressure:\n\nonly when formula_11. Here, formula_12 and formula_13 are the dimensions of the plate, and formula_14 is the difference in forces. The Wilhelmy plate measurements give pressure – area isotherms that show phase transition-like behaviour of the LM films, as mentioned before (see figure below). In the gaseous phase, there is minimal pressure increase for a decrease in area. This continues until the first transition occurs and there is a proportional increase in pressure with decreasing area. Moving into the solid region is accompanied by another sharp transition to a more severe area dependent pressure. This trend continues up to a point where the molecules are relatively close packed and have very little room to move. Applying an increasing pressure at this point causes the monolayer to become unstable and destroy the monolayer forming polylayer structures towards the air phase. The surface pressure during the monolayer collapse may remain approximately constant (in a process near the equilibrium) or may decay abruptly (out of equilibrium - when the surface pressure was over-increased because lateral compression was too fast for monomolecular rearrangements). \nFigure 3. (i) Surface pressure – Area isotherms. (ii) Molecular configuration in the three regions marked in the formula_1-A curve; (a) gaseous phase, (b) liquid-expanded phase, and (c) condensed phase. (Adapted from Osvaldo N. Oliveira Jr., Brazilian Journal of Physics, vol. 22, no. 2, June 1992)\n\nMany possible applications have been suggested over years for LM and LB films. Their characteristics are extremely thin films and high degree of structural order. These films have different optical, electrical and biological properties which are composed of some specific organic compounds. Organic compounds usually have more positive responses than inorganic materials for outside factors (pressure, temperature or gas change). LM films can be used also as models for half a cellular membrane.\n\n\n\n"}

This corresponds to the point of focus for parallel rays. The image is formed at the focal point of the lens.\n\nSimply two lens system such as a refractor telescope, the object at infinity forms an image at the focal point of the objective lens, which is subsequently magnified by the eyepiece. The magnification is equal to the focal length of the objective lens divided by the focal length of the eyepiece.\n\nIn practice, not all photographic lenses are capable of achieving infinity focus by design. A lens used with an adapter for close-up focusing, for example, may not be able to focus to infinity. Failure of the human eye to achieve infinity focus is diagnosed as myopia.\n\nAll optics are subject to manufacturing tolerances; even with perfect manufacture, optical trains experience thermal expansion. Focus mechanisms must accommodate part variations; even custom-built systems may have some means of adjustment. For example, telescopes such as the Mars Orbiter Camera, which are nominally set to infinity, have thermal controls. Deviations from its operating temperature are actively compensated to prevent shifts of focus.\n\n"}
{"id": "2227536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227536", "title": "Doctrine of worthier title", "text": "Doctrine of worthier title\n\nIn the common law of England, the doctrine of worthier title was a legal doctrine that preferred taking title to real estate by descent over taking title by devise or by purchase. It essentially provides that a remainder cannot be created in the grantor's heirs, at least not by those words.\n\nThe rule provided that where a testator undertook to convey an heir the same estate in land that the heir would take under the laws of inheritance, the heir would be adjudged to have taken title to the land by inheritance rather than by the conveyance, because descent through the bloodline was held to be \"worthier\" than a conveyance through a legal instrument.\n\nThe doctrine of worthier title, like the Rule in Shelley's Case, had its origin in attempts by royal courts to defeat various devices contrived by lawyers during the era of feudalism to retain lands in their families while avoiding feudal duties, and to secure its free alienability. The creation of family settlements designed to preserve land within the family, transfer it without feudal duties due to the lords of the fee upon transfer at death, and preserve it from claims of creditors, occupied the ingenuity of many common lawyers during the late Middle Ages. So did efforts to undo the restrictions placed by ancestors once they became inconvenient. These concerns underlie the explanation given in \"Coke on Littleton\":\n\nThe law deemed that since no one is an \"heir\" until the person he or she inherits from dies, an attempt to create a remainder interest in the heir created no present interest at all. This interpretation draws strength by analogy from the common words of a conveyance in fee simple, \"to N. and his heirs.\" This conveyance creates no present interest in any heir; why should a remainder do the same?\n\nBut if the heir receives the same interest in the property that he would have received either way, the doctrine of worthier title would appear at first impression to be a distinction without a difference.\n\nThe rule makes a difference when property owners make \"inter vivos\" gifts of less than fee simple interests. Suppose Adam owns title to lands, is married to Beulah, and executes a deed \"to Beulah for life, and then to Adam's heirs\", Caleb and Dinah. Adam's intent in these words of conveyance would appear to be to grant Beulah a life estate, and then create a vested remainder interest in his apparent heirs Caleb and Dinah. The remainder interest is vested because Beulah is mortal; her death is certain to happen. But, since Caleb and Dinah are already Adam's apparent heirs, their interest under the laws of descent is \"worthier\" than the interest they take under the instrument, and the deed is construed as if Adam had stopped with \"to Beulah for life.\" This doctrine is further complicated by the fact that although Caleb and Dinah are Adam's heirs apparent, it is legally impossible to determine who is an heir until the death of the grantor.\n\nThe remainder interest Caleb and Dinah were meant to have in the land subject to Beulah's life estate would have been a vested interest as the conveyance was written, but that vested interest is wiped out by the doctrine of worthier title. Imagine then that Adam then falls on hard times, and his creditors take judgments against him. If the deed were given effect as written, Caleb and Dinah's vested rights to the remainder interest would have existed prior to any judgment liens, and would therefore be prior in right to the claims of Adam's creditors. The doctrine of worthier title, preferring title by intestate succession over title by the instrument, wipes out that vested interest and prefers the rights of Adam's creditors over the rights of Adam's heirs. This illustrates that although the doctrine of worthier title, by its terms, does not affect the right passed from the ancestor to the heir, it can operate to cut off rights of the heirs against third parties.\n\nThe doctrine of worthier title can also affect estates created by will, when those estates are in people who would not take by intestate succession. Suppose once more that Adam is a testator; Adam's good friends in life were Edward and Fran, and Adam's surviving child is Dinah. Under applicable state laws of intestate succession, Dinah would be Adam's heir if Adam had no will.\n\nBut Adam does have a will: It firstly leaves his land \"to Edward for life, then to Adam's heirs\", and it also contains a residuary clause that leaves the remainder of Adam's estate to Fran. By the operation of the instrument, Edward would have a life estate in the land, while Fran would inherit the rest of the estate immediately; then \"Adam's heirs\"i.e., Dinahwould have a vested remainder interest in the land, and expect to inherit it upon Edward's death. The doctrine of worthier title intervenes, however, with unexpected results. The doctrine prefers the interest \"Adam's heirs\" would have taken to the interest created by an instrument. Here, however, Adam's will designates Fran as his heir at law. Instead of a life estate in Edward, followed by a vested remainder in Dinah, the doctrine of worthier title operates to disinherit Dinah completely, treats the interest of the heirs as a mere reversion, and upon Edward's death gives the land, as well, to Fran.\n\nThe doctrine of worthier title can be avoided by naming specific people, or classes of people (e.g. \"my children\"), instead of using the phrase \"my heirs\". As such, the doctrine of worthier title seldom comes into play. The doctrine has also been abolished, either by statute or by judicial decisions, in many common law jurisdictions. In some jurisdictions, the rule survives, but only as a presumption or a rule of construction, that can be rebutted by evidence that the grantor meant otherwise.\n\n"}

It is the drinking water source for approximately 85,000 residents in the city of Bellingham as well as Whatcom County. It is approximately in length and in width at its widest. Lake Whatcom is located and managed within three political jurisdictions: the city of Bellingham, Whatcom County, and the Lake Whatcom Water and Sewer District.\nThe lake is a popular area for motor boating, swimming, fishing, and other recreational activities.\n\nThe lake is divided into three basins. Basin 1, the Silver Beach Basin, is the furthest north, and has a maximum depth of . Land use in Basin 1 is primarily residential development, with one large park and several small parks. Basin 2, the Geneva Basin, is the central basin where the drinking water for the city of Bellingham is withdrawn. This basin is the shallowest, with a maximum depth of just . Land use is primarily residential, with a mix of lake protection program properties and some rural forestry. Basin 3 is the southernmost basin and is the most remote. At its greatest depth, Basin 3 is deep, and is estimated to contain 96% of the lake's total water volume. Land use in Basin 3 is composed of scattered residential development, mostly in the community of Sudden Valley, as well as rural and commercial forestry. The total area of the Lake Whatcom Watershed is .\n\nThere are nine annual streams and approximately 25 additional small creeks and tributaries that flow into Lake Whatcom, accounting for 23 sub-watersheds in all. Lake Whatcom drains into Bellingham Bay by way of Whatcom Creek.\n\nThe lake has only one island, the Reveille Island, owned by Camp Firwood, which is believed to be the site of past ceremonies by Native Americans, due to the presence of pictographs and a zoomorphic stone bowl found on the island.\n\nThe earliest known settlement was a Northwest Coast Salish village at the south end of the lake, occupied by the Saquantch tribe. Around 1800 the Saquantch were pushed out by the Lummi tribe. In the 1850s came the first known settlement of Westerners on Lake Whatcom. The first claim of private land was reported for $8. Most of the area surrounding the lake was extensively logged by the end of the 19th century. Large coal mining operations also existed near the lake from the late 19th century through 1919, when the Whatcom Mining Company closed down. In 1946 J.H. Bloedel donated 12.5 acres to the city for what would eventually become Bloedel Donovan Park. In 1962 water was diverted from the Middle Fork of the Nooksack River, through a tunnel, to supply water to a then-new paper-mill on the Bellingham waterfront.\n\nAs a drinking water source, Lake Whatcom’s quality is in compliance for all tested chemicals, bacteria and turbidity. Bellingham is a participant in the Partnership for Safe Water and the City’s drinking water also meets the higher standards set by this group. For the past 10 years the City of Bellingham Public Works has received the Partnership for Safe Water’s Director Award for commitment to providing safe drinking water.\n\nLake Whatcom was placed on the Environmental Protection Agency's 303(d) list for impaired water bodies in 1998, due to low dissolved oxygen (DO) levels, which are directly related to the amount of phosphorus Lake Whatcom receives. Low DO levels do not directly affect drinking water quality. As required by the 303(d) listing, the Washington State Department of Ecology (DOE) created a computer model to find the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) of phosphorus the lake can receive while maintaining adequate dissolved oxygen levels. In 2008 the DOE estimated that in order to achieve acceptable levels of DO, impervious/run off surfaces need to be returned to pre-1988 levels.\n\nMost of the phosphorus enters the lake through non point sources, such as water runoff from storms in parks and lands surrounding the lake. A small portion is attributed to lawns, gardens, and streets containing some phosphorus. Aging septic systems serving development in the watershed possibly could leach phosphorus into the water body. In 2005 fertilizers containing phosphorus were banned to try to reduce the amount of phosphorus entering the lake. The city of Bellingham and Whatcom County have also restricted development activities such as land clearing, from October 1 through May 31 annually to prevent runoff from exposed soil during high precipitation months.\n\nA 2010-2014 management program Work Plan for Lake Whatcom was approved by the councils of the City of Bellingham, Whatcom County and Lake Whatcom Water & Sewer District (formerly Water District 10.) Annual analysis and progress reports are prepared to support of the five year management program.\nLake Whatcom is a monomictic lake. The water body is stratified for part of the year (late spring through mid-fall) and mixed during the rest. This phenomenon is important to the hydrology of the lake. The top layer of water (epilimnion) is warmed by the sun and sits atop the metalimnion (also a thermocline). In this middle layer water temperatures take a pronounced decline and eventually a distinct third layer forms (hypolimnion), much colder and isolated from the rest of the water body. Minimal oxygen from the air diffuses down to the hypolimnion, causing very low dissolved oxygen (DO) levels. This combined with sediment oxidation, cause for near or complete anoxic conditions in the deeper levels of the lake. This stratification is more pronounced in Basin 3 where water is deepest. This layering of the lake, as well as the distinct physical barriers (sills) between basins cause for slow movement of water through the lake. (Ecology TMDL, 2008)\n\nAnother important hydrological phenomenon on Lake Whatcom is the occurrence of seiches. A seiche is the slow sloshing of water from one side of the lake to the other, due to winds in Lake Whatcom’s case. Winds will push water to one side of the lake, causing water levels to rise on one end and lower on the other. When the wind stops, the water rebounds back and forth until it is settled again. This up and down movement of the water causes the thermocline to rise and fall as well, which can result in the cold, anoxic water from Basin 3, to spill over the Strawberry Sill into Basin 2.\n\nMajor outputs of lake water are Whatcom Creek (77.5% of outflow), City of Bellingham intake (11.3%), evaporation (7.9%) and hatchery (2.5%). The estimated residence time of water entering the lake until it leaves is 7.4 years. (Lake Whatcom Annual Report, 2008/09)\n\nInvasive species of particular threat to Lake Whatcom include zebra mussel, New Zealand mud snail, Asian carp, and viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS). Currently, none of the fifteen species identified by the state of Washington as \"most unwanted\" are found in the lake. Eurasian water milfoil is the only species on Washington's list of 50 unwanted species (13 of which are freshwater) that is known to exist in Lake Whatcom.\n\nLake Whatcom is home to 13 species of fish. Among these are six native species: Kokanee salmon (non-anadromous form of Sockeye), coastal cutthroat trout, Longnose Sucker, Peamouth Chub, Sculpin and Threespine Stickleback. Three species have been introduced to the lake: Bluegill, rainbow trout, and smallmouth bass by fisheries authorities. There are four species that have been illegally introduced: Brown Bullhead, Largemouth bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish and Yellow Perch. The Department of Health has consumption advisories for smallmouth bass and yellow perch, which can be found at the DOH Website\n\nBased on the 2014 Lake Whatcom Watershed Annual Report there are currently 6,877 dwelling units in the Whatcom County Watershed with appropriate assessor’s residential land use codes, and improvement values of greater than 10,000 dollars. 1,595 of these units are zoned within the city of Bellingham, 1,551 are zoned within the urban growth boundary, 2,566 are zoned in the Sudden Valley neighborhood, and 1,165 are zoned as rural. There are 1,811 existing vacant lots with improvement values of greater than $10,000 and an estimated 8,688 total units with build-out potential. \nCurrently, based on the city of Bellingham’s 2007 guide to Lake Whatcom, the Lake Whatcom Watershed is zoned for residential use, private commercial forest use, public land, urban growth area, and watershed protected properties, along with non-residential reconveyance areas. There are 31, 127 total acres in the Lake Whatcom Watershed. 4,007 of these are developed, 5,552 are zoned for development but are currently undeveloped, and 2,519 are protected under conservation easement, as a result of land use acquisition by the city of Bellingham and private individuals.\n\n\n"}

His parents were Harry Shigekiyo Kiyooka and Mary Kiyoshi Kiyooka. Roy's grandfather on the maternal side, a samurai Ōe Masamichi, was the 17th headmaster of the Musō Jikiden Eishin-ryū school of swordsmanship. Roy Kiyooka's brother Harry Mitsuo Kiyooka also became an abstract painter, a professor of art, and sometimes a curator of his brother's work. Roy's youngest brother Frank Kiyooka became a potter.\n\nIn 1942, after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the family was uprooted and moved to a small town in rural Alberta called Opal. Roy Kiyooka was unable to finish high school.\n\nFrom 1946 to 1949, he studied with Jock Macdonald and Illingworth Holey Kerr at the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art. With a scholarship, he was able in 1955 to go to Mexico for eight months to study under James Pinto at the Instituto Allende in San Miguel de Allende. In 1956 he began teaching at the Regina College of Art. In Regina, he worked with a group of abstract painters, but Kiyooka left for Vancouver in 1959 and thus was not included in the group show coined the \"Regina 5'.\n\nAt the time, Kiyooka was very impressed with Clement Greenberg's ideas. In the summers from 1957 to 1959 he took part in the Emma Lake Artists' Workshops of the University of Saskatchewan, and there worked with Will Barnet and Barnett Newman.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1964, he was at the \"Vancouver School of Art\" (now \"Emily Carr University of Art and Design\"), from 1965 to 1970 at the Sir George Williams University in Montréal (now \"Concordia University\").

He was chief conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, and was formerly music director of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra from 2005 until 2018.\n\nRobertson was born and raised in Malibu, California, and grew up in a music-loving family. His father was a research scientist at Hughes Laboratory and his mother studied literature, but later had a career as a baker. In grade school, he played French horn and violin, and first conducted at age 12. He later studied horn, composition, and conducting as a college student at the Royal Academy of Music in London.\n\nAfter his college years, Robertson began to receive conducting offers in Europe and performed often in both symphonic and operatic repertoire. His early career lectured under the rubric of the U.S. Information Agency in the Middle East and around the world on the subject of music. In 1985, Robertson was appointed resident conductor of the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra.\n\nFrom 1992 to 2000, Robertson was music director of the Paris-based Ensemble Intercontemporain (EIC), the first American to hold the post. He broadened the EIC's repertoire to include works by composers such as John Adams. In 2000, Robertson was named the Music Director of the Orchestre National de Lyon (ONL) and artistic director of Lyon's Auditorium. He was the first individual to serve simultaneously in both capacities and the first American to be appointed to either position. He and the ONL toured the United States in 2003, with concerts in New York City, Seattle, Berkeley, and Los Angeles. He concluded his tenure in Lyon in 2004.\n\nRobertson's relationship with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra (SLSO) began in January 1999 when he made his first conducting appearance with the orchestra. Robertson's second appearance with the SLSO occurred in February 2002 at Carnegie Hall after the SLSO's then-music director Hans Vonk withdrew a few days before the concert due to health problems. Robertson agreed to substitute, and he and the orchestra had only one rehearsal before the concert. He later appeared with the SLSO in March 2003. The SLSO named Robertson its next Music Director in December 2003, effective with the 2005-2006 season.\n\nIn April 2005, Robertson led the SLSO for the second time in a Carnegie Hall concert, after a labor dispute at the SLSO was resolved. Robertson conducted the SLSO in Carnegie Hall again in November 2005, March and April 2006, and March 2007. Robertson was one of Carnegie Hall's Perspectives artists for the 2005-2006 season, and he curated concerts with the SLSO and other performances with various guest artists and ensembles.\n\nRobertson is generally regarded as having restored the SLSO's artistic prominence after the sudden resignation of the prior music director Hans Vonk, and the orchestra's labor dispute in the winter of 2005. New concert series begun during his tenure include a group of contemporary music concerts with the Pulitzer Arts Foundation and a series of \"Fusion Concerts\" at the Touhill Performing Arts Center of the University of Missouri–St. Louis. In September 2006, the SLSO announced the extension of Robertson's contract through 2010, with a clause to allow for yearly renewal. As of November 2009, his SLSO contract was through the 2011-2012 season. Following a subsequent contract renewal through 2014, his SLSO contract was extended, in January 2013, through the 2015-2016 season.c In March 2014, the orchestra and Robertson announced a further extension of his SLSO contract through the 2017-2018 season. In December 2016, the SLSO and Robertson jointly announced an additional one-year extension of his contract through the 2018-2019 season, which was the intended time for the close of his SLSO tenure. However, in June 2017, the orchestra noted an update to Robertson's contract, with a newly scheduled conclusion of his music directorship at the close of the 2017-2018 season, in a reversion of the December 2016 situation. Robertson stood down as SLSO music director in 2018.\n\nDuring Robertson's tenure, the SLSO made its first-ever appearance at The Proms in September 2012. With the SLSO, Robertson has conducted several commercial recordings of music of John Adams (composer) for the Nonesuch label. These works include:\n\nIn February 2005, Robertson was named the principal guest conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra (BBC SO) and he assumed that post later in the year, in parallel with the beginning of his St. Louis tenure. On September 12, 2009, Robertson became the second American conductor and the first standing BBC SO principal guest conductor to conduct the Last Night of the Proms. He concluded his tenure as the BBC SO's principal guest conductor in August 2012.\n\nRobertson first guest-conducted the Sydney Symphony Orchestra in 2003. In 2014, he became the Sydney Symphony Orchestra's chief conductor and artistic adviser. He concluded his tenure in Sydney in December 2019, following a one-year extension of his contract announced in July 2017.\n\nRobertson's other work in contemporary music has included serving as Festival Director for the Los Angeles Philharmonic's January 2008 \"Concrete Frequency\" Festival, as well as Music Director of the 2008 Ojai Music Festival in Ojai, California. His work in opera has included several appearances at the Metropolitan Opera, including Janáček's \"The Makropulos Affair\" (1996), Mozart's \"Die Entführung aus dem Serail\" (2008), Britten's \"Billy Budd\" (2012). and Mozart's \"The Marriage of Figaro\" in 2012. Robertson also conducted the first production of \"The Death of Klinghoffer\" at the Metropolitan Opera in October 2014. In February 2018, the Juilliard School announced the appointment of Robertson as its next director of conducting studies, effective with the 2018-2019 academic year.\n\nRobertson has recorded for the Sony Classical, harmonia mundi, Naive, EMI/Virgin Classics, Atlantic/Erato, Nuema, Ades Valois, Naxos and Nonesuch labels, featuring the music of such composers as Adams, Bartók, Boulez, Carter, Dusapin, Dvorák, Ginastera, Lalo, Manoury, Milhaud, Reich, Saint-Saëns, and Silvestrov.\n\nRobertson has been married three times. His third wife is pianist Orli Shaham, the sister of violinist Gil Shaham. Robertson and Shaham first met at a January 1999 SLSO concert, which was the SLSO debut for both of them. They married on January 3, 2003. She is mother to their twin boys, Nathan Glenn, and Alex Jacob, born September 15, 2007. The family makes its home in New York City. Robertson has two grown sons, Peter and Jonathan, from his second marriage to the German writer Ane Dahm.\n\nRobertson received the Seaver/National Endowment for the Arts Conductors Award in 1997. In December 1999, \"Musical America\" named David Robertson Conductor of the Year. Robertson received the 2006 Ditson Conductor's Award from Columbia University for his championing of American music. In April 2010, Robertson was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. On May 15, 2010, Robertson received the degree Doctor of Music honoris causa from Westminster Choir College in Princeton, New Jersey. In October 2011, Robertson was named a \"Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres\" by the Ministry of Culture of France. His recording of John Adams' 'City Noir' won a Grammy.\n\nAlong with Diana Doherty, Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Nigel Westlake and Synergy Vocals, Robertson was nominated for the 2019 ARIA Award for Best Classical Album for the album \"Nigel Westlake: Spirit of the Wild / Steve Reich: The Desert Music\".

{"id": "2227559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227559", "title": "Equine conformation", "text": "Equine conformation\n\nEquine conformation evaluates the degree of correctness of a horse's bone structure, musculature, and its body proportions in relation to each other. Undesirable conformation can limit the ability to perform a specific task. Although there are several faults with universal disadvantages, a horse's conformation is usually judged by what its intended use may be. Thus \"form to function\" is one of the first set of traits considered in judging conformation. A horse with poor form for a Grand Prix show jumper could have excellent conformation for a World Champion cutting horse, or to be a champion draft horse. Every horse has good and bad points of its conformation and many horses (including Olympic caliber horses) excel even with conformation faults.\n\nThe standard of the ideal head varies dramatically from breed to breed based on a mixture of the role the horse is bred for and what breeders, owners and enthusiasts find appealing. Breed standards frequently cite large eyes, a broad forehead and a dry head-to-neck connection as important to correctness about the head. Traditionally, the length of head as measured from poll to upper lip should be two-thirds the length of the neck topline (measured from poll to withers). Presumably, the construction of the horse's head influences its breathing, though there are few studies to support this. Historically, a width of 4 fingers or 7.2 cm was associated with an unrestricted airflow and greater endurance. However, a study in 2000 which compared the intermandibular width-to-size ratio of Thoroughbreds with their racing success showed this to be untrue. The relationship between head conformation and performance are not well understood, and an appealing head may be more a matter of marketability than performance.\nAmong mammals, morphology of the head often plays a role in temperature regulation. Many ungulates have a specialized network of blood vessels called the \"carotid rete\", which keeps the brain cool while the body temperature rises during exercise. Horses lack a carotid rete and instead use their sinuses to cool blood around the brain. These factors suggest that the conformation of a horse's head influences its ability to regulate temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStraight, upright, or vertical shoulder\nLaid-back or sloping shoulder\nThe humerus (a.k.a. the arm bone)\n\nThe arm bone is from the point of shoulder to the elbow, it is covered in heavy muscle and serves as a leverage point for the muscle of the front leg attached near the elbow.\n\n\"Ideal\"\n\n\nConformation of the Ideal Humerus (all measurements are while the horse is standing squarely)\n\n\nFaults\n\n\"\"Too long humerus\"\"\nnote \"standing under\" simply means that the horses legs are too far under his body and his chest sticks out.\n\n\"\"Short humerus\"\"\n\nnote: that is the shoulder is too angled (less than 45 degrees) then the horse's front legs will be stilted and stiff.\nThe Elbow\n\n\nConformation\n\n\n\"Possible faults\"\n\n\"\"Turned-in/tied-in elbow\"\"\n\n\n\"\"Out-turned elbow\"\"\n\n\n\nConformation\n\n\n\"Long forearm\"\n\n\n\"Short forearm\"\n\n\nThe conformation of the horse's chest plays a significant role in his level of endurance and stamina. A horse that will do work requiring speed, power, or endurance needs as much room as possible for maximum lung expansion. The horse's ribs form the outer surface of the chest and define the appearance of the horse's midsection, or barrel, the area between the front legs and hindquarters.\n\nThe thorax of the horse is flatter from side to side, as compared to the human thorax, which is flatter from back to back. The horses thorax is also deeper from the breastbone to the spine. This gives the horse a greater lung capacity, and thus greater endurance.\n\nConformation\n\nChest shape\nWhen viewing the chest from the front, the chest should be wider at the bottom than at the top. The shoulder blades should be much closer together at their tops, toward their withers, than at the points of shoulders where the front legs attach.\n\nWell-sprung ribs\n\nSlab-sided ribs\n\nBarrel chest and deep chest\n\n\"Chest faults\"\nNarrow chest\n\nToo-wide chest\n\n[All information is derived from \"The horse Conformation Handbook\" written by Heather Smith Thomas]\n\nNarrow breast\nPigeon-breasted\n\nMutton withers\n\nHollow behind withers\nHigh withers \n\nLong back \nShort back \nSaddle-, hollow-, low-, sway-backed/ down in the back \n\nRoached back \n\nLong or weak loins/weak coupling \n\nShort –coupling\n\nRough coupling/widow's peak\n\nThe croup is from the lumbosacral joint to the tail. The \"hip\" refers to the line running from the ilium (point of the hip) to the ischium (point of the buttock)of the pelvis. After the point that is made by the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae, the line following is referred to as the croup. While the two are linked in terms of length and musculature, the angle of the hip and croup do not necessarily correlate. But it is desirable for a horse to have a square to slightly pear shaped rump. A horse can have a relatively flat croup and a well-angled hip. Racehorses do well with hip angles of 20-30 degrees, trotting horses with 35 degrees. Once a horse is developed, the croup should be approximately the same height as the withers.

{"id": "2227563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227563", "title": "Tiddy Mun", "text": "Tiddy Mun\n\nTiddy Mun was a legendary bog spirit in Lincolnshire, England, who was believed to have the ability to control the waters and mists of The Fens of South Lincolnshire and The Carrs of North Lincolnshire.\n\nThe belief in Tiddy Mun was first documented in June 1891 in an article by M. C. Balfour in the Folklore Society journal \"Folk-Lore\". In the article she recalls a story, collected in the Ancholme Valley, told to her by an older person who spoke of a curse of pestilence that had been cast upon his village by the Tiddy Mun, who was angered at the draining of the Fens by the Dutch, led by Cornelius Vermuyden, in the seventeenth century. According to the story the Tiddy Mun was eventually placated after the villagers gathered at twilight at the time of the new moon, poured buckets of water into the dyke and apologised for the damage caused.\n\nHe was not exclusively malevolent; if the Fens flooded and the waters reached the villages, people would go out at night and call \"Tiddy Mun wi'out a name, tha watters thruff!\" (\"Tiddy Mun without a name, the water's through!\") until they heard the cry of a peewit, and the next morning the waters would have receded.\n\nIn his 1987 \"Folklore\" paper \"Tiddy Mun's Curse and the Ecological Consequences of Land Reclamation\", Darwin Horn argues that all but one of Tiddy Mun's specific curses may be connected to misfortune and disease brought about by the effect of draining the fenland.\n\nThe Tiddy Mun was described, by folklorist M.C. Balfour in 1891, as being no bigger than a three-year-old child, but looking like an old man with long, tangled white hair and a matted white beard. He is said to have worn a grey gown so that at dusk he was difficult to see. His laughter was said to resemble the call of the peewit.\n\nWriting in 1955, folklorist E. H. Rudkin also records another Ancholme Valley belief of an imp-like race of beings who were generally considered mischievous but benevolent. They were 'called the Tiddy people', but also \"the Strangers\", \"Greencoaties\" and \"Yarthkins\". The 'Tiddy' name related to their size and Rudkin quotes a source describing them: 'They be tiddy critturs, no more than a span high, wi' arms an' legs as thin as thread, but great big feet an' hands, an' heads rollin' aboot on their shoulders'.\n\nThe Tiddy people would dance, by moonlight, on large flat stones, known as \"Strangers Stones\", found in the area. Rudkin records a local tradition of smearing the stones with blood and lighting fires on them, but was unable to determine a meaning, or specific belief, behind the practice. The first of the crops would also be left on the \"Strangers Stones\", as well as bread and salt, to keep the Tiddy people happy and ensure a good harvest.\n\n"}
{"id": "2227569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227569", "title": "Crud (game)", "text": "Crud (game)\n\nCRUD, (also known as \"Slosh”, \"Remiball\", “Goonball”, or “Molliball\") is a fast-paced game loosely based on billiards or pool, and originated in the Royal Canadian Air Force. It is played in units of the Canadian Armed Forces, the Canadian Coast Guard, the United States Air Force, the United States Navy, the United States Marine Corps, the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force.\n\nThe game is played on an old pool or snooker table (usually the latter, when available) using the cue ball (the \"shooter ball\"), and one \"object ball\" (most commonly a striped ball since it is easiest to determine if it is in motion). Playing Crud on a new or good condition table may get you banned from the Mess. Pool cues are not used; the shooter ball is launched across the table surface with the hand. A game of crud involves moving around the table and other players, trying to grab the shooter ball and either strike the object ball before it stops moving or sink it.\n\nCRUD is a competitive, team sport. Each member of the two teams normally has three lives. A team's order of play is established at the beginning of a game and recorded on the scoreboard. A team must play in order, like baseball's batting order. Anyone caught playing out of turn loses a life. \n\nIn the event of an uneven number of players wishing to be involved with a crud match, a \"ghost\" may be assigned to a team missing the required number of players. Losing a life will instead damage the ghost, regardless of which player on the team loses it. Once the ghost loses 3 lives, it is gone and play resumes as normal.\n\nThere will be at least one referee or judge, who is usually positioned centered on one of the long sides. If the referee is holding a drink and is bumped/jostled in such a way as to spill it, the offending player loses a life and must replace the beverage. In addition, a scorekeeper is sometimes used to keep track of lives lost.\n\nThe referee's rulings are final. Arguing with the referee is authorized; however, intelligence and sportsmanship may become suspect if it continues unabated. Continual quibbling may be penalized by the loss of a life. Above all else, crud is a gentleman's game.\n\nThe game opening event used to determine which team has choice. From the Shooter End, Team Captains simultaneously release a ball so that it touches the opposite short side of the table. The ball that returns closest to the Shooter end without touching it or the side rails determines choice of shooting or receiving. If neither player can keep the lag within the legal limits after 3 attempts, other players may try again, or a coin will be flipped.\n\nThe opening event of each Round. With the Object Ball spotted on the center line 6 inches (152 mm) from the Receiver end of the table, the Shooter is given 3 attempts to hit the spotted Object Ball using any number of bumper bounces. Shooter Ball movement may only be stopped by the Judge or the Shooter. Any Service where the Shooter Ball goes beyond half the length of the Table will be counted as 1 attempt. If he/she does not manage to hit the object ball or the object ball does not travel 6 inches within 3 attempts, the shooter is assessed a life.\n\nNeither the defender nor anything on his/her person (i.e. clothing) may touch the object ball once it is set or in motion nor the shooter ball until it has struck the object ball or play has been declared over. An infraction of this rule ends play and the player is assessed a life. (Exception - see shooter ball leaving the table).\n\nOnce the shooter ball strikes the object ball, the defender becomes the shooter and the next player from team A becomes the defender. The previous shooter must vacate the playing area without affecting play in any way. \n\nAny time a life is lost for any reason play stops and is restarted with a serve - the team which lost a life receiving (Exception - last player on a team is never obliged to serve unless both teams are down to their last player. A single player left against a team of several is called 'a runner' and always has the option to serve or receive regardless of which team loses a life).\n\nOnce continuous play has commenced with the object ball moving at least six inches, the next shooter picks up the shooter ball from anywhere she can reach it and attempts to strike the object ball before it stops moving. If possible, the shooter will attempt to sink the object ball in one of the available pockets. The shooter may move around the table to grab the shooter ball and may move back and forth to either end to shoot. The shooter may crawl or roll or jump over the table while moving provided that his feet do not touch the felt surface. Contact between the feet and the felt surface ends play and the offending shooter loses a life. There is no limit to the number of misses a player can make as long as the object ball remains in motion. \n\nWhen attempting a shot, the Shooter must keep one foot on the floor at all times. If both feet end up off the floor, the Shooter forfeits a life.\n\nThe shooter may only make contact with the object ball by throwing the shooter ball from one of the short ends of the table, not from the sides. The validity of a shot at the end of the table is determined by the location of the player's crotch with respect to an imaginary 45° line drawn (or extension of long side imaginary line -ACPA) from the corners of the table. Failing to be within the end of the table while shooting the shooter ball is a foul, called 'Balls' (or 'Lips' if female), and the offending player is assessed a life.\n\nIf the player is unable to hit the object ball with the shooter before the object ball stops moving (dead ball) he/she loses a life. If the object ball is sunk by team A in one of the legal pockets (a kill), a life may be assessed on either the previous shooter or the next shooter on team B, depending on who allowed the object ball to be killed; determination is solely within the discretion of the Judge, but is usually assessed against the player who last held the shooter ball (ie if the next shooter has already grabbed the shooter ball, he loses a life - otherwise the previous player on her team loses the life). The shooter ball is then passed to the next player (in this case the next shooter on team B) to serve.\n\nLegal pockets - house rules vary as to which pockets are allowed for kill shots. Sinking the object into the pockets at the same end as the shooter (close corners) being quite easy, variants which allow this turn the game into a more tactical attempt to keep the object ball in the centre of the table. Game which disallow close corners tend to see more violent shots and faster moving balls. Some house rules disallow the side pockets. Toilet paper rolls may be used to block disallowed pockets or if the pockets are open, sinking the object ball into a disallowed pocket costs the shooter a life.\n\n\"No Six\" – Whenever the Object Ball is hit, it must travel 6 inches, including bumper bounce, except in the cases of the \"Double Kiss, Dead.\" The Judge will determine the distance of travel based on his judgment of where the Object Ball was last hit. If full travel is less than 6 inches, center-ball to center-ball, the Life is against the last Shooter. \n\nWhile taunting an opponent is legal, fun, and generally encouraged, players may not physically interfere with each other or either ball (exception - shooter ball leaves the table). Interference calls may result in the referee warning the offender, or assessing the offending blocker a life. Stationary blocking is permitted provided that the player holds onto the table with both hands. Light body checks by the shooter in order to jockey for position are permitted. If the body check is excessive in the eyes of the referee, the shooter may be warned or assessed a life. The level of physical contact between team members may be waived to any level deemed appropriate by the referee in coordination and agreement of both teams involved in the match. The shooter must be given a reasonable opportunity to acquire the shooter ball.\n\n\"Blocking\" – When blocking has been allowed, the Shooter has the primary right to the table. The Shooter has a right to get to the Shooter Ball without being blocked by the Defender. The Shooter has a right to make a shot. In some cases, the Shooter will need to go around a Defender who is up against the side of the Table. Inadvertent or accidental Blocking, as determined by the Judge, will not be held against the Defender. The Defender's team has blocking rights based on the following:\n-- A blocker must hold onto the side portion of the Table. \n-- Once established in a position to block, a blocker may not move his feet to re-establish another position as the Shooter moves around the Defender. If the Shooter moves to the other end of the table, this rule then applies at that end. \nThe shooter may run over, under, around or through blockers (knocking them aside) though the judge may rule that excessive violence has been used and penalize the shooter with a life. Blockers may not retaliate against a shooter who uses fair roughness against them and may not move once set in position. The shooters team-mates may not attempt to clear blockers but may assist him by, for example, lifting him over blockers.\n\n\"F.O.D.\" – Any Foreign Object Debris that falls or spills onto the playing surface. A piece of attached clothing will not constitute F.O.D. unless it touches one of the Balls during play. Whereas it may be necessary for a Shooter to transit the playing surface to retrieve or shoot the Shooter Ball, a player's shoes or feet may not touch the playing surface or bumpers. The Defender may not be on or somehow resting on the playing surface when anticipating a Shooter's play. \n\nWhen a player loses all three lives, that player must withdraw from the match. Order of play is adjusted accordingly, with play still alternating between the two teams regardless of how many survivors are playing. IE: the last survivor could alternate between several opponent players.\nIt is customary for the first player out to procure a beverage of choice for the referee as penalty for their lack of finesse in the game. It is also customary for the second player out to procure a beverage for the lineman/scorekeeper (as used in play). The third player should procure a beverage for the scorekeeper if a lineman is employed.\n\nSingle-man rules apply only when one team has only one player remaining. If both teams are down to one player, then normal rules apply. For the sake of simplicity, the team with the single man is referred to as team A and the opposing team as team B.\n(ACPA rules differ somewhat. )\n\n\"Ball off the Table\" – When the Shooter Ball is shot so vigorously that it causes the object ball to leave the playing surface the shooter loses a life. Exception - if the object ball bounces off anything, including a player, and returns to the table, play continues. No player may intentionally knock the object ball back into play (penalty is a life). Contact with a player must be accidental. In cases of doubt the referee will decide whether contact was accidental or intentional.\n\nWhen the shooter ball leaves the table, play continues. The shooter must retrieve the shooter ball wherever it is and return to the table to resume play. The shooter's team-mates may assist him by retrieving the ball and passing / throwing it to her (only when it has clearly left the table and struck the floor or a wall etc). The defender's team may not interfere with attempts to retrieve the shooter ball except by blocking with both hands on the sides of the table (if blocking has been allowed before the start of play) or by kicking the shooter ball (they may, for example, attempt to kick it out of the room).\n\nUnder no circumstances shall anyone make contact with the Judge, Ass't Judge, or scorekeeper or spill their drinks. Anyone doing so will be assessed a life and/or be required to purchase the offended party a replacement drink at the bar.\n\nWhen a team loses all of its players the match is over and the other team is declared the victor. The players of the losing team are required to buy their counterparts a beverage of their choice. If there is a member on the winning team with all three lives intact, said team member is also called a \"crudmaster\".\n\nWhen teams agree to allow full body checking and blocking similar to what one finds in ice hockey (combat crud) rank is left out of the game. Junior officers are allowed to knock over more senior officers without any disciplinary repercussions, just as in any contact sport. This version is therefore quite popular among subalterns.\n\nThere are many variants on these rules, including the degree to which contact is allowed (for example, full contact, no contact, or contact so long as the blocker is stationary). Check the rules posted on the wall at your establishment; however, reading the rules or mouthing the words while reading the rules may cost you a life (local rules vary).\n\nA dominant variation of crud is also played under many names. In this variation, the game is played on regular-sized pool tables, but every man is for himself/herself (no teams) and the object ball must be struck from the opposite end of the table. All six pockets are in play. The game has also spread under the name \"Balls\" and may be played with two opponents (singles), three opponents in free-for-all (triples) or with two teams of two (doubles). If the game is played in doubles, the teams are diagonal players, who usually remain stationary. Games play up to 11 points (win by 2) assessed to an entire team instead of lives assessed to individual players. In singles or doubles, a team scores a point when the ball dies while in the possession of the other team (a sunk ball is dead). In doubles, either team member may strike during a team's possession. In triples, points are strikes assigned to the next player in the striking order (when any of the three players has at least 11 strikes and two more than either of the other players, they are eliminated and the game follows doubles rules). Service is always provided by the team who did not gain a point on the previous play, except in the case of an imminent loss (next point would be a loss). The striker ball leaving the table is not a foul, and the game remains in play.\n\nShuck utilizes the same two-ball system and many of the rules of crud, but does not employ a referee – it is geared towards casual home and bar play. Rules not mentioned below are generally acquired from crud.\n\nBasic concept: Two teams of two players each. Unlike crud, there is no rotation of turns, instead all 4 players are involved in every point and either player on a team can grab the cue ball during the play of a point, but no player can ever reach over the center of the table to grab the cue ball; one team may shoot several times in a row. First team to 11 points wins, losing team takes a \"shot\". The opening serve comes from either player on the serving team. The server gets only two attempts to hit \"the object ball\" otherwise the opposing team receives a point and control of the serve. The cue ball must be rolled (not thrown) and either it or the object ball must hit a wall or be on pace to hit a wall following the serve for it not to be called a fault. The team that scored a point on the prior play always takes the next serve.\n\nScoring: Once the object ball is moving it is like a \"time-bomb\" in the sense that when it stops moving the location of the cue ball on the table will (may) determine the winner of the point, i.e. if the cue ball is on your side of table when the object ball stops moving, you lose the point. The only variation to this is the \"Gentleman's Rule\" (see below).\n\nMaking the ball: You score a point by making the object ball in one of the two corner pockets on your opponent's (i.e., the opposite) side of the table or by banking the ball into a side pocket or back into one of your own pockets. If, upon striking the object ball, it goes either directly into a side pocket or the pockets on your own side of the table then you lose the point (note: toilet paper to block the side pockets is an acceptable variation). If the cue ball goes into ANY pocket on your throw, you lose the point—with one exception, the \"shuck\", explained below.\n\nGentleman's rule: If the ball is coming to a stop and you throw (roll) the cue ball at it but miss and the ball stops, it does not matter what side of the table the cue ball is on, you still lose the point because you missed it (it's pretty obvious when it happens – no complaining allowed). Also part of the Gentleman's Rule is that you cannot just simply roll/push the cue ball onto your opponent's side when the ball is slowing to a stop. This rule is both as complicated as it is critical to the gameplay, and those attempting to play may not quite understand it at first but it will become obvious soon after playing a couple of rounds (think \"I Know It When I See It\" from Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart's opinion in the landmark 1964 case involving what should or should not be considered obscene—you'll just know it).\n\nShuck: A rare and gutsy play for advanced players. If your opponent strikes the object ball and you believe it is going into your pocket (or banking into a side pocket or their own pocket), you can take the cue ball and \"shuck\" it at your opponent's corner pockets. If you sink the cue ball in their pocket before the object ball falls into a pocket, you have essentially stolen the point away from your opponent. Of course, if you attempt a shuck and sink the cue ball, but the object ball does not fall into a pocket then you lose the point. The Gentleman's rule is also employed if the object ball stops just short of a pocket as your shuck with the cue ball misses (i.e., you would still lose the point).\n\nA more simple, popular variation is called H-O-R-S-E (or horse pool) or P-I-G (or pig pool), building on the rules of Tim. Like the H-O-R-S-E variation of basketball, each player has five lives (represented by letters of H-O-R-S-E). Like Tim, it is played on a six-pocket pool table, as individuals, and is particularly challenging because all shots must be released from the table end opposite the object ball.\n\nThe defender of a served the ball is called the \"server\". The server rolls the object ball horizontally from the shooter, from one side to the other. The server must roll the ball on the opposite end of the table between the first and third dot, from either the left or the right side of the shooter. A \"mis-serve\" is any ball rolled by the Server that goes out of the bounds of the first and third dot. Three mis-serves in a row results in a letter for the server.\n\nThe shooter has three tries to hit the ball. If the ball is not tapped, the shooter gets a letter. If the ball is released from the near side of the table to the object ball, the shooter gets a letter. If the ball goes in a pocket, the next person in order gets a letter.\n\nNobody gets a letter if the object ball goes in a pocket on a serve. This is called T-N-A. The Shooter may only T-N-A twice in a row; the third T-N-A results in a letter to the shooter.\n\nThere is not a \"no six\" rule in H-O-R-S-E; the player is allowed to stop the object ball dead, if it is possible, resulting in a letter for the next player. The \"double-kiss\" rule is replaced with a \"double-tap\" rule, which reverses the order of play. A shooter who performs a \"double-tap\" does not play again; the player who was in order before that player must now play. The new order persists after play stops. (A \"double-tap\" does nothing in a two-person game.)\n\n\"Walking the table\" is never permitted, and the shooter must have at least one foot on the ground when shooting. There may or may not be a referee. The player who gains the last letter becomes the shooter, and the winner of a game becomes the shooter of the next game and may choose to start play in forward or in reverse order.\n"}

The overall sound of the album is slightly flat and compressed, to give a similar sound to the varying productions of each track which are taken from the albums between the years 1974 up to 1977. \n\nThe Japanese single release of \"Strutter '78\" includes a different version to that on the album: faster and shorter, with an altered guitar solo, plus a more prominent hi-hat (cymbal) sound throughout.\n\nThe original vinyl release, in a gatefold-sleeve, had an embossed, silver-foiled sleeve, with the band members in bas-relief inside. The album was packaged with a printed \"Platinum Award\" thanking the Kiss Army for making the band a \"Double Platinum Success\". Later reissues would retain the gatefold-sleeve but replaced the logo with a printed, red-type version and the band members were now represented inside by photos rather than the \"bas\" illustrations. When the album was remastered for CD in the US in 1997, it mimicked the original vinyl.\n\nThe album was certified Platinum on May 16, 1978 by the RIAA.

Karanth\n\nBabukodi Venkataramana Karanth (19 September 1929 – 1 September 2002) was a film and theatre personality from India. Throughout his life he was director, actor and musician of modern Indian theatre both in Kannada as well as Hindi, and one of the pioneers of Kannada and Hindi new wave cinema. He was born in Dakshina Kannada.\n\nHe was an alumnus of the National School of Drama (1962) and later, its director. He has directed many successful plays and has directed award-winning works in Kannada cinema. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri.\n\nBorn in Manchi, a village near Babukodi in Bantwal taluk of Dakshina Kannada district in 1929, Karanth's passion for theatre started at an early age. His first tryst with theatre was when he was in standard III – he acted in \"Nanna Gopala\", a play directed by P.K. Narayana.\n\nHe then ran away from home and joined the legendary Gubbi Veeranna drama company where he worked alongside Rajkumar who also was starting out then as a novice.\n\nGubbi Veeranna sent Karanth to Banaras to gain a Master of Arts degree, where he also underwent training in Hindustani music under Guru Omkarnath Thakur.\n\nThereafter, along with his wife, Prema Karanth, Karanth set up \"Benaka\", one of Bangalore's oldest theatre groups. It is an acronym for Bengalooru Nagara Kalavidaru. Then, Prema took up a teaching job in Delhi and supported Karanth through the National School of Drama. He was to return the compliment after he graduated from the NSD, and eventually became its director.\n\nHe later graduated from the National School of Drama (NSD), New Delhi, in 1962, then headed by Ebrahim Alkazi. Between 1969 and 1972, he worked as a drama instructor at the Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, New Delhi after which the couple returned to Bangalore. Here Karanth dabbled in some cinema as well as music and was involved with the likes of Girish Karnad and U.R. Ananthamurthy in these ventures.\n\nHe then returned to the NSD, this time as its Director in 1977. As the director of NSD, Karanth took theatre to far-flung corners of India. He conducted several workshops in places far away as Madurai in Tamil Nadu. After his stint as the director of NSD, the Madhya Pradesh government invited him to head the Rangamandal repertory under the aegis of the Bharat Bhavan. \n\nAfter rendering yeoman service to the theatre scene in Madhya Pradesh between 1981 and '86, Karanth returned to Karnataka. It was alleged by the MP Police that he was having an affair with one actress-Vibha Mishra, where in a drunk state, he poured Kerosene over her, and burnt her. However, Vibha, after recovering from her injuries, gave a statement that proved Karanth's innocence and freed him from the charges of an attempt to murder. He was criticised bitterly by Women activists and was forced to move out of Bhopal.\n\nIn 1989, the Karnataka government invited him to set up a repertory in Mysore, which he named Rangayana and headed until 1995. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in the late 1990s and died at 8 p.m. (IST) on 1 September 2002 in a private hospital in Bangalore.\n\nKaranth entered the Kannada theatre scene in the late 1960s and early '70s. His entry brought about a sea change in Kannada theatre which then was steeped in the old, formal proscenium style. His plays like Jokumara Swamy, Sankranti, Huchu Kudure and Oedipus to name a few, which were directed in the early 1970s, were hailed as trendsetters. These plays touched upon all aspects of theatre like language, music, song, stylisation\n\nThe innovative use of music was one Karanth's biggest contributions to theatre. One of Karanth's strengths was his ability to draw on classical, traditional and folk forms and fuse them in his compositions. His plays were less famous for design as for their musical content, which became part of the prose of theatre.\"\n\nIn 2010, at the 12th Bharat Rang Mahotsav, the annual theatre festival of National School of Drama, Delhi, a tribute exhibition dedicated to life, works and theatre of B.V. Karanth and Habib Tanvir was displayed.\n\nKaranth directed over a hundred plays, more than half of which were in Kannada with Hindi close behind. He also directed plays in English, Telugu, Malayalam, Tamil, Punjabi, Urdu, Sanskrit and Gujarati. \"Hayavadana\" (by Girish Karnad), \"Kattale Belaku\", \"Huchu Kudure\", \"Evam Indrajit\", \"Oedipus\", \"Sankranti\", \"Jokumara Swami\", \"Sattavara Neralu\", \"Huttava Badidare\" and \"Gokula Nirgamana\" are some of his most popular plays in Kannada.\nOf the forty or so plays he directed in Hindi, Macbeth (using the traditional Yakshagana dance drama form), King Lear, Chandrahasa, Hayavadana, Ghasiram Kotwal, Mrichha Katika, Mudra Rakshasa, and Malavikagni Mitra are some of the more popular ones. Karanth also revelled in directing children and directed several children plays like \"Panjara Shale\", \"Neeli Kudure\", \"Heddayana\", \"Alilu Ramayana\" and \"The Grateful Man\".\n\nIn 1974, Karanth started \"BeNaKa\" a repertory in Bangalore. Benaka was an acronym for \"Bengalooru Nagara Kalavidaru\". Benaka stages several hugely popular plays like \"Hayavadana\" all across Karnataka and even overseas. At Benaka, Karanth also took a special interest in children's theatre and directed several plays with children. This group has been taken care of by Prema Karanth, Karanth's late wife and a noted theatre personality in her own right. She died on 29-10-07.\n\nKaranth was largely responsible for starting the new theatre movement in Madhya Pradesh. As director of the NSD, at the invitation of the Bharat Bhavan in Bhopal, he organized a training-cum-production camp in 1973. In the 1980s, he returned to set up the Rangmandal repertory in Bharat Bhavan. This was to be the first-ever repertory in the state and he became the main creative spirit behind the now-legendary Bharat Bhavan.\n\nRangmandal, for the first time, folk professionals were used for training contemporary actors, and the repertory also included folk performers among its members. Apart from Hindi, plays were also produced in dialects such as Bundelkhandi, Malavi and Chhattisgarhi which created huge ticket-buying audiences for the Rangmandira.\n\nWith the integration of Alarippu and National school of Drama-New Delhi, Karanth had contributed three great plays in Telugu. Collaborated with Surabhi theatre of Andhra Pradesh, Karanth conducted three workshops respectively 'Bhishma' in 1996, 'Chandipriya' in 1997 and 'Basthidevatha yadamma'. It is his dedication that Karanth spent his time during the workshops in corner villages of Andhra Pradesh to brought up the dramas.\n\nKaranth directed four feature films and four documentaries, apart from scoring the music for 26 films. He co-directed films like Vamsha Vriksha and Tabbaliyu Neenade Magane with Girish Karnad.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2012, Films Division produced a 93-minute film on BV Karanth called . The film bases itself on BV Karanth's autobiography in Kannada called \"Illiralaare, Allige Hogalaare\" (I can't stay here, I won't go there) compiled by well known Kannada writer Vaidehi.\n\n\n"}

Its capital is Yenagoa. The main language spoken is Ijaw with dialects such as Kolukuma, Mein, Bomu, Nembe, Epie-Atisa, and Ogbia. Like the rest of Nigeria, English is the official language. The state was formed in 1996 from part of Rivers State and is thus one of the newest states of the Nigerian federation.\n\nBayelsa state was created out of Rivers State on October 1, 1996 by the Sani Abacha's military government. Its name was derived from the first few letters of the names of the major local government areas from which it was formed - Brass LGA (BALGA), Yenagoa (YELGA) and Sagbama (SALGA). Hence BAYELSA was derived from the letters BA + YEL + SA.\n\nBayelsa State has one of the largest crude oil and natural gas deposits in Nigeria. As a result, petroleum production is extensive in the state. However, the majority of Bayelsans live in poverty.\n\nThey are mainly rural dwellers due to the terrain and lack of adequate transportation, health, education or other infrastructure as a result of decades of neglect by the central governments, state governments, and petroleum prospecting companies. This has been a large problem in the state since its creation; successive state governments have not been able to address and repair the issue. The state, as a result, has an almost non-existent commerce. Successive state governments have embarked on industrial projects (even venturing into the oil and gas sector) and poverty-alleviation programs to reverse this situation. Some argue that there is nothing on ground to show for huge sums of money spent for development by successive and present state governments.\n\nThe local population engage in fishing on a subsistence and commercial level. The Bayelsa State government is otherwise the main employer in the state.\n\nBayelsa has a riverine and estuarine setting. Many communities are almost (and in some cases) completely surrounded by water, making them inaccessible by road. The state is home to the Edumanom Forest Reserve, in June 2008 the last known site for chimpanzees in the Niger Delta.\n\nOther important cities besides Yenagoa include Akassa, Lobia, Amassoma (the home of the Niger Delta University), Eniwari, Ekeremor, Aliebiri, Peretoru, Twon-Brass, Egwema-Brass, Kaiama, Nembe, Odi, Ogbia, Okpoama, Brass, Oporoma, Otuan, Sagbama, Olugbobiri, Peremabiri, and Swali.\n\nLanguages of Bayelsa State listed by LGA:\n\nDue to massive overseas scholarship programs implemented by the old Rivers State in the 1970s and recent Bayelsa State governments, large numbers of Bayelsan professionals reside in Europe and North America.

Its capital is the city of Bauchi. The state was formed in 1976 when the former North-Eastern State was broken up. It originally included the area now in Gombe State, which became a distinct state in 1996.\n\nThe Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University is located in the capital city Bauchi. Other educational institutions located in the state include Bauchi State University, Abubakar Tatari Ali Polytechnic and Federal Polytechnic, Bauchi.\n\nAccording to tradition, it was named for a hunter known as Baushe, who settled in the region before the arrival of Yakubu, the first traditional ruler of Bauchi emirate (founded 1800–10).\n\nIn Hausa the word Bauchi means \"the land of freedom and tourism\". Bauchi and Adamawa were the two main sources of freedom and tourism for the Fulani empire of Sokoto.\n\nWhat is now known as Bauchi was until 1976 a province in the then North-Eastern State of Nigeria. According to the 2006 census, the state has a population of 4,653,066.\n\nBauchi State has gone through tremendous transformation over the years. The Ajawa language was spoken in Bauchi State, but became extinct between 1920 and 1940 as speakers switched to Hausa.\n\nDuring the colonial era up to independence, it formed part of the Bauchi Plateau of the then Northern Region, until the 1967 state creation exercise, when the Bauchi, Borno, and Adamawa provinces constituted the former North-Eastern State.\n\nWith the creation of Bauchi State in 1976, then comprising present Bauchi and Gombe State, it included 16 local government areas. The number of local government areas in the then Bauchi State was increased to 20 and later to 23. However, in 1997 when Gombe State was created out of Bauchi and additional local governments were created in the country, Bauchi State was left with 20 local government areas as shown below.\n\nSharia law was adopted in June 2001.\n\nBauchi State consists of twenty Local Government Areas (LGAs). They are:\n\nBauchi State occupies a total land area of representing about 5.3% of Nigeria's total land mass and is located between latitudes 9° 3' and 12° 3' north and longitudes 8° 50' and 11° east.\n\nThe state is bordered by seven states, Kano and Jigawa to the north, Taraba and Plateau to the south, Gombe and Yobe to the east and Kaduna to the west.\n\nBauchi state is one of the states in the northern part of Nigeria that span two distinctive vegetation zones, namely, the Sudan savannah and the Sahel savannah. The Sudan savannah type of vegetation covers the southern part of the state. Here, the vegetation gets richer and richer towards the south, especially along water sources or rivers, but generally the vegetation is less uniform and grasses are shorter than what grows even farther south, that is, in the forest zone of the middle belt.\n\nThe Sahel type of savannah, also known as semi-desert vegetation, becomes manifest from the middle of the state as one moves from the state's south to its north. This type of vegetation comprises isolated stands of thorny shrubs.\n\nOn the other hand, the southwestern part of the state is mountainous as a result of the continuation of the Jos Plateau, while the northern part is generally sandy.\n\nThe vegetation types as described above are conditioned by the climatic factors, which in turn determine the amount of rainfall received in the area. For instance, the rainfall in Bauchi state ranges between per annum in the south and only per annum in the extreme north. This pattern is because in the West Africa sub-region, rains generally come from the south as they are carried by the southwesterlies. There is therefore a progressive dryness towards the north, culminating in the desert condition in the far north. So also is the case in Bauchi state.\n\nConsequently, rains start earlier in the southern part of the state, where rain is heaviest and lasts longer. Here the rains start in April with the highest record amount of per annum. In contrast, the northern part of the state receives the rains late, usually around June or July, and records the highest amount of per annum.\n\nIn the same vein, the weather experienced in the south and the north varies considerably. While it is humidly hot during the early part of the rainy season in the south, the hot, dry and dusty weather lingers up north.\n\nIn addition to rainfall, Bauchi state is watered by a number of rivers. They include the Gongola and Jama'are rivers.\n\nThe Gongola River crosses Bauchi state in Tafawa Balewa Local Government Area in the south and in Kirfi and Alkaleri Local Government Areas in the eastern part of the state, while the Jama’are River cuts across a number of Local Government Areas in the northern part of the state. Moreover, a substantial part of the Hadeja-Jama'are River basin lies in Bauchi state, which along with various fadama (floodplain) areas in the state provides suitable land for agricultural activities. These are further supported by the number of dams meant for irrigation and other purposes. These include the Gubi and Tilde-Fulani dams. There also lakes such as the Maladumba Lake in Misau Local Government Area that further provide the necessary conditions to support Agriculture.\n\nBauchi State has a total of 55 tribal groups in which Gerawa, Sayawa, Jarawa, Kirfawa, Turawa Bolewa, Karekare, Kanuri, Fa'awa, Butawa, Warjawa, Zulawa, Boyawa MBadawa, Hausa and Fulani are the main tribes. This means that they have backgrounds, occupational patterns, beliefs and many other things that form part of the existence of the people of the state.\n\nThere are cultural similarities in the people's language, occupational practices, festivals, dress and there is a high degree of ethnic interaction especially in marriage and economic existence. Some of the ethnic groups have joking relationships that exist between them, e.g. Fulani and Kanuri, Jarawa and Sayawa, etc.\n\nWest Chadic language groups spoken in Bauchi State:\n\n\nLanguages of Bauchi State listed by LGA:\n\nOther languages of Bauchi State are Ajawa, Beele, Berom, Kanuri, Kwaami, Manga, Pero, and Piya-Kwonci.\n\n"}

Benin City the capital has a history of being one of the foremost destinations of Europeans during their exploration of the African continent many centuries ago. Some of the flash points have remained tourists attractions for the state.\n\nThe Mid-Western Region was a division of Nigeria from 1963 to 1991, formally known as Bendel state from 1976. It was formed in June 1963 from Benin and Delta provinces of the Western Region, and its capital was Benin City. It was renamed a province in 1966, and in 1967 when the other provinces were split up into several states, it remained territorially intact, becoming a state.\n\nDuring the Nigerian Civil War, the Biafran forces invaded the new Mid-Western state, en route to Lagos, in an attempt to force a quick end to the war. While under Biafran occupation, the state was declared as the “Republic of Benin” as Nigerian forces were to retake the region. The republic collapsed a day after the declaration as Nigerian troops overtook Benin City. Edo State was formed on August 27, 1991 when Bendel State was split into Edo and Delta States.\n\nWith Benin City as capital, the population of the entire state is approximately 8 million. It is made up of three major ethnic groups; namely Edo (Binis), Esan and Afemai (Owan/Etsako) with Akoko Edo. However the State has a high presence of residents from across the country and the world because of its cosmopolitan tendencies. Benin City the capital has a history of being one of the foremost destinations of Europeans during their exploration of Africa continent many centuries ago. Some of the flash points have remained enviable tourists’ attraction for the state.\n\nThe main ethnic groups in Edo State are Binis, Etsako, Esans, Owans and Akoko Edos. Virtually all the groups traced their origin to Benin City hence the dialects of the groups vary with their distance from Benin City. The Bini speaking people who occupy seven out of the 18 Local Government Areas of the state constitute 57.14%; while others are as follow: Esan (17.14%), Etsako (12.19%), Owan (7.43%), and Akoko Edo (5.70%). However, the Igbira speaking communities exist in Akoko Edo as well as Ijaw Izons, Urhobos, Itsekiris communities in Ovia North East and South West Local Government Areas especially in the borderlands. Also, Ika speaking communities exist in Igbanke in Orhionmwon LGA.\n\nA lot of communities and indeed the ruling dynasties in all the clans trace their roots to the ancient kingdom of Benin. Cultural similarities are in the areas of religious worships, folk-lore, dances, festivals, traditional modes of dressing, arts and craft. The political pattern and behaviour are based on a situation where both the monarchial and republican ideas flourished in an integrated manner. The colourful traditional festivals in the state manifest its rich cultural heritage. Critical among these are the Igue and Ekaba festivals done among the Binis and manhood initiation (age groups) by the Etsako people.

{"id": "2227628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227628", "title": "Borno State", "text": "Borno State\n\nBorno, also known as Borno State, is a state in north-eastern Nigeria. Its capital and largest city is Maiduguri. The state was formed in 1976 from the split of the North-Eastern State. Until 1991 it contained what is now Yobe State. The motto or slogan of the state is \"Home of Peace\". Borno is the homeland of the Kanuri people in Nigeria and several other ethnic groups. \n\nBorno has been the epicenter of the Islamist group Boko Haram since it began its insurgency in 2009. The conflict in Borno drew media attention in 2009 after clashes between Boko Haram and government security forces in which the founder of Boko Haram Mohammed Yusuf was reportedly captured alongside 300 of its members. Days later Mohammed Yusuf was announced dead after he reportedly attempted to escape from detention.\n\nAfter a decade of protracted conflict that has destroyed economic activities and normal life, the governor of the state Babagana Umara Zulum in 2019 commenced a multi-pronged strategy of his own recruiting 10,000 hunters \"voodoo powers\" to help government forces rout the insurgents.\n\nThe state has a predominance of Kanuri people. Other ethnic groups such as Lamang, Babur/Bura and Marghi are also found in the southern part of the state. Shuwa Arabs are mainly the descendants of Arab people and is an example of the endurance of traditional political institutions in some areas of Africa, where the emirs of the former Kanem-Bornu Empire have played a part in the politics of this area for nearly 1,000 years. The current Kanemi dynasty gained control of the Borno Emirate in the early 19th century after the Fulani jihad of Usman dan Fodio. Conquered by Rabih in 1893, Borno was invaded by the British, French and Germans at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1902, the British officially incorporated Borno into the Northern Nigeria Protectorate and established a new capital at Maiduguri or Yerwa in 1907, which remains the capital to this day.\n\nAfter Nigerian independence in 1960, Borno remained fairly autonomous until the expansion of the number of states in Nigeria to 12 in 1967. Local government reform in 1976 further reduced the power of the emirs of the former dynasty, and by the time of Nigeria's return to civilian rule in 1979, the emirs' jurisdiction has been restricted solely to cultural and traditional affairs. The emirs still exist, and serve as advisers to the local government. Mala Kachallah was elected governor of Borno State in 1999 under the flagship of the then APP(All Peoples Party) later ANPP. Ali Modu Sheriff was elected governor of Borno State in Nigeria in April 2003. He is a member of the All Nigeria People's Party (ANPP). Ali Sheriff was the first governor in Borno state to win the seat two consecutive times.\n\nBoko Haram's insurgency began in 2009, with Borno being the worst-affected area. On 14 May 2013, President Goodluck Jonathan declared a state of emergency in northeastern Nigeria, including Borno State along with the neighboring states of Adamawa and Yobe. This happened after fighting between Boko Haram and the state armed forces killed 200 people in the town of Baga. A spokesman for the armed forces declared that the offensive would continue \"as long as it takes to achieve our objective of getting rid of insurgents from every part of Nigeria.\"\n\nIn July 2014, Borno State governor Kashim Shettima said that \"176 teachers had been killed and 900 schools destroyed since 2011.\" After the Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping in April 2014, most schools in Borno State were closed. They were scheduled to reopen in November 2014.\n\nIn November 2014, UNICEF reported it has increased its Community Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) centres in Borno State \"from 5 to 67 and is planning to increase this to 100.\" In Borno State, the agricultural sector has suffered mostly because of the insurgency and many people experienced acute food insecurity.\n\nBorno State consists of twenty-seven (27) Local Government Areas, grouped into three Senatorial Districts (shown below with their areas and 2006 Census population figures):\n\nIn addition, there are Eight Emirate Councils (Borno, Damboa, Dikwa, Biu, Askira, Gwoza, Shani and Uba Emirates), which advise the local governments on cultural and traditional matters.\n\nA wide variety of Biu–Mandara languages are spoken in Borno State, particular in the Mandara Mountains.\nLanguages of Borno State listed by Local Government Area:\n\nOther languages of Borno State are Lala-Roba, Tarjumo, Yedina, and Tedaga.\n\nIslam continues to be the dominant faith practiced in Borno State, Nigeria, with much smaller numbers of adherents of Christianity and other faiths spread throughout and living within the region. Sharia operates as the primary foundation for the development, interpretation, and enforcement of most civic codes and laws. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Maiduguri has its seat in the state.

Its capital and largest city is Enugu, from which the state derives its name. The principal cities in the state are Enugu, Ohum, Ezeagu, Ngwo, Nsukka, Agbani, Awgu and Udi.\n\nEnugu State is one of the states in the eastern part of Nigeria located at the foot of the Udi Plateau. The state shares borders with Abia State and Imo State to the south, Ebonyi State to the east, Benue State to the northeast, Kogi State to the northwest and Anambra State to the west.\n\nEnugu, the capital city of Enugu State, is on the railroad from Port Harcourt, 150 miles (240 km) south-southwest, and at the intersection of roads from Aba, Onitsha, and Abakaliki. It is approximately 4 driving hours away from Port Harcourt, where coal shipments exited Nigeria. Enugu is also located within an hour's drive from Onitsha, one of the biggest commercial cities in Africa and two hours' drive from Aba, another very large commercial city, both of which are trading centres in Nigeria. The average temperature in this city is cooler to mild (60 degrees Fahrenheit) in its cooler months and gets warmer to hot in its warmer months (upper 80 degrees Fahrenheit) and very good for outdoor activities with family and friends or just for personal leisure.\n\nEnugu has good soil-land and climatic conditions all year round, sitting at about above sea level, and the soil is well drained during its rainy seasons. The mean temperature in Enugu State in the hottest month of February is about , while the lowest temperatures occur in the month of November, reaching . The lowest rainfall of about is normal in February, while the highest is about in July.\n\nThe name of the state derives from its capital city, Enugu. The word \"Enugu\" (from \"Enu Ugwu\") means \"the top of the hill\". The first European settlers arrived in the area in 1909, led by a British mining engineer named Albert Kitson. In his quest for silver, he discovered coal in the Udi Ridge. The Colonial Governor of Nigeria Frederick Lugard took a keen interest in the discovery, and by 1914 the first shipment of coal was made to Britain. As mining activities increased in the area, a permanent cosmopolitan settlement emerged, supported by a railway system. Enugu acquired township status in 1917 and became strategic to British interests. Foreign businesses began to move into Enugu, the most notable of which were John Holt, Kingsway Stores, the British Bank of West Africa and the United Africa Company.\n\nFrom Enugu the British administration was able to spread its influence over the Southern Province of Nigeria. The colonial past of Enugu is today evidenced by the Georgian building types and meandering narrow roads within the residential area originally reserved for the whites, an area which is today called the Government Reserved Area (GRA).\n\nFrom being the capital of the Southern Provinces, Enugu became the capital of the Eastern Region (now divided into nine States), the capital of now defunct Federal Republic of Biafra, thereafter, the capital of East Central State, Anambra State, (old) Enugu State, and now the capital of the present Enugu State through a process of state creation and diffusion of administrative authority.\n\nThe State Government and the Local Government are the two levels of government in Enugu State and in all other states of Nigeria. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi is the current executive governor of Enugu State. He was elected by the people in April 2015 and was sworn in on 29 May 2015. Sullivan Chime is the immediate past governor succeeding Chimaroke Nnamani. He was elected by the people of Enugu State in April 2007 and was sworn into office on 29 May 2007. The governor is above a group of commissioners who he has placed as heads of ministries that oversee various portfolios such as Health and Housing; both the governor and the commissioners form the Executive Council of Enugu State. Government House, Enugu is where the government of the state is based.\n\nEnugu State consists of 17 Local Government Areas. They are:\nEconomically, the state is predominantly rural and agrarian, with a substantial proportion of its working population engaged in farming, although trading (18.8%) and services (12.9%) are also important. In the urban areas trading is the dominant occupation, followed by services. A small proportion of the population is also engaged in manufacturing activities, with the most pronounced among them located in Enugu, Oji, Ohebedim and Nsukka. The state boasts of a number of markets especially at each of the divisional headquarters, prominent of which is the Ogbete Main market in the State capital, Enugu. There is also one of the largest grains market East of the Niger, the Orie Orba Market which plays host to most farmers from the North Central States of Benue, Kogi, Nassarawa and Plateau who use the market to dispose their produce for consumers in South-East and South-Southern Nigeria . Every four days, grains and other farm produce are found in large quantities and at highly competitive prices.\n\nElectricity supply is relatively stable in Enugu and its environs. The Oji River Power Station (which used to supply electricity to all of Eastern Nigeria) is located in Enugu State. With the deregulation of electricity generation in Nigeria and the privatisation of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN), it is hoped the State Government would assist private investors to negotiate the take over and reactivation of the Oji Power Station. This is more so with the proximity of the Enugu coal mines to the power station, a driving distance of about 20 minutes. There are also traces of crude oil in Ugwuoba, in the same Oji-River Local Government area of the state. The state will also negotiate with investors interested in investing in the coal mining in Enugu. The coal industry used to be one of the biggest employer of labour in the state and the state is looking to attract investors in the industry.\n\nEvery community in Enugu State has at least one Primary/Elementary school and one Secondary school, funded and run by State Government. There are also large numbers of private nursery, primary and secondary schools in Enugu State.\n\nNigeria's first indigenous university, (University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN)), is located in Enugu State. The state also hosts the Enugu State University of Science & Technology (ESUT), Institute of Management and Technology (IMT), Federal Cooperative College, Oji River (FCCO); Enugu State College of Education Technical, Enugu; Caritas University, Amorji-Nike, Renaissance University, Ugbawka; Command Day Secondary School Enugu, Federal Government College Enugu, Federal School of Dental Technology & Therapy, College of Immaculate Conception, Enugu, Queen's School Enugu a Prominent high school for girls in the Eastern region; St. Theresa's College, Nsukka; Special Science Boys' Secondary School Agbani, Nkanu West L.G.A; [St. Patrick's Secondary School], Emene, Bigard Memorial Seminary, Enugu; Awgu County College, Nenwe; Community Secondary School, Ugbo-Okpala, Ugbo; Corpus Christi College, Achi, Royal Crown Academy, Nsukka, Enugu State, Enugu]; Our Saviour Institute of Science and Technology, Enugu; and the Federal College of Education, Eha-Amufu, Seat of Wisdom Secondary School Trans Ekulu Enugu, Osisatech boys secondary school. There are also a host of private computer schools and training centres concentrated in Enugu and Nsukka. There are also notable private Tertiary Institutions in Enugu such as Caritas University, a Catholic university founded by a Catholic Priest: Father Edeh, and Renaissance University.\n\nThe University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (UNTH) is located in Enugu State, as is the Enugu State University Teaching Hospital and College of Medicine, which is located in the capital city, Enugu. In addition to numerous private hospitals and clinics in the state, there are seven District Hospitals at Enugu –Urban, Udi, Agbani, Awgu, Ikem, Enugu-Ezike, and Nsukka – and at least one health centre or cottage hospital in every one of the 17 Local Government Areas and 39 Development Centres in the state. The University of Nigeria Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) is also located in Enugu.\n\nAmong the notable Medical Institutions in Enugu are Niger Foundation Hospital and Enugu State University Teaching Hospital (Popularly known as Park Lane)\n\nEnugu State had a population of 3,267,837 people at the census held in 2006 (estimated at over 3.8 million in 2012). It is home of the Igbo of southeastern and few Idoma/Igala people in Ette (Igbo-Eze North) of Enugu State, Nigeria.\n\nA significant portion of the people of Enugu adhere to Christianity with small groups adhering to African traditional religion known as Omenani, or are irreligious or atheist. There are little number of Hausa people and Yoruba people, who came for business.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2227632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227632", "title": "Jigawa State", "text": "Jigawa State\n\nJigawa is a state in northwestern Nigeria. Its capital is Dutse.\n\nJigawa State is one of thirty-six states that constitute Federal Republic of Nigeria. It is situated in the northwestern part of the country between latitudes 11.00°N to 13.00°N and longitudes 8.00°E to 10.15°E. Kano State and Katsina State border Jigawa to the west, Bauchi State to the east and Yobe State to the northeast. To the north, Jigawa shares an international border with Zinder Region in The Republic of Niger, which is a unique opportunity for cross-border trading activities. The government readily took advantage of this by initiating and establishing a free trade zone at the border town of Maigatari in Niger.\n\nThe state has a total land area of approximately 22,410 square kilometres. Its topography is characterized by undulating land, with sand dunes of various sizes spanning several kilometres in parts of the State. The southern part of Jigawa comprises the basement complex while the northeast is made up of sedimentary rocks of the Chad Formation. The main rivers are Hadejia, Kafin Hausa and Iggi Rivers with a number of tributaries feeding extensive marshlands in north-eastern part of the State. Hadejia – Kafin Hausa River traverses the state from west to east through the Hadejia-Nguru wetlands and empties into the Lake Chad Basin.\n\nMost parts of Jigawa lie within the Sudan Savannah with elements of Guinea Savannah in the southern part. Total forest cover in the state is below national average of 14.8%. Due to both natural and human factors, forest cover is being depleted, making northern part of the state highly vulnerable to desert encroachment. The state enjoys vast fertile arable land to which almost all tropical crops could adapt, thus constituting one of its highly prized natural resources. The Sudan savannah vegetation zone is also made up of vast grazing lands suitable for livestock production.\n\nThe socio-cultural situation in Jigawa State could be described as homogeneous: it is mostly populated by Hausa/Fulani, who can be found in all parts of the state. Kanuri are largely found in Hadejia Emirate, with some traces of Badawa mainly in its Northeastern parts. Even though each of the three dominant tribes have continued to maintain its ethnic identity, Islam and a long history of inter-marriages have continued to bind them together.\n\nAbout 3.6 million people inhabit Jigawa State. Life expectancy as at 2001 was about 52 years with a total fertility rate of about 6.2 children per woman of childbearing age (a little above the national average). Although population of the state is predominantly rural (90%), the distribution in terms of sex is almost equal between male (50.8%) and female (49.2%). This pattern of population distribution is same across various constituencies and between urban and rural areas. The 2002 CWIQ Survey indicated that 45.2% of the population was made up of young people below the age of 15; 49.0% between the ages of 15 and 59 while 5.8% were people aged 60 and above. This survey reveals a dependency ratio of almost 1; meaning that there is almost one dependent to every economically active person in the population.\n\nAverage household size was about 6.7 almost all of which were headed by males. About 60% of household heads were self-employed with agriculture as their main occupation, and nearly two-thirds of these households were monogamous families. The overall literacy rate was about 37% in 2002 (22 percent for women and 51 percent for men). School enrolment ratio is fairly high with very good improvements in the last few years, even though there is still clear disparity between boys and girls.\n\nBasic indicators for water supply sector show that access to potable water is over 90%, which is among the highest in the country. The 2002 CWIQ Survey however, indicated that while access to high quality safe drinking water (pipe born, hand pump boreholes and protected wells) is low at about 63%, nearly two-thirds of households have good means of sanitation. In terms of health services, about two-fifths of the population have access to medical services which is, however, higher in urban areas where access was found to be about 55%. The CWIQ Survey found that an average of 70% of those who consulted a health facility expressed satisfaction with the services provided.\n\nThe Bade language is spoken in Guri LGA, the Warji language is spoken in Birnin Kudu LGA, and the Duwai language is spoken in Hadejia LGA. Major languages are Hausa and Fulani.\n\nReligion in Jigawa State is mainly Islam which constitutes about 98.9% of the population, while 1.1% are indigenous Christians.\n\nJigawa State—created out of the old Kano State in August 1991—is one of the 36 states in Federal Republic of Nigeria. The agitation for the creation of the state was led by Malam Inuwa-Dutse, a former commissioner in the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources during the governorship of late Audu Bako, the governor of old Kano State (comprising present Kano and Jigawa states). By the 1999 Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria, the state comprises 27 local government councils, which are divided into 30 state constituencies, grouped into 11 federal constituencies and 3 senatorial districts. These 27 local government councils were further subdivided into 77 development areas by law No. 5 of 2004 of the State House of Assembly. In line with the democratic setting in the country, the governments at both the state and local government levels are elected, and comprise an executive with a unicameral legislature. The state legislature has 30 elected members each representing one of the state constituencies. To complete the state governance structure, there is an independent state judiciary as the third arm of government.\n\nThe State Government administrative apparatus is organized into ministries, extra-ministerial departments and parastatals, which are located across the three senatorial districts in the state since 1999. This decentralized approach to governmental administrative structure was seen as a move towards stimulating economic activities socio-economic development and empowerment over a wider area since government is the largest employer, perhaps second only to agriculture. In addition, this was also seen as a way for spreading even development among major urban centers and a shift from “city-state syndrome” that obtained in the old Kano State.\n\nJigawa State consists of twenty-seven (27) Local Government Areas, They are:\n\nThe economy of Jigawa State is largely characterized by informal sector activities with agriculture as the major economic activity. Over 80% of the population is engaged in subsistence farming and animal husbandry. Trade and commerce are undertaken on small and medium scale, especially in agric goods, livestock and other consumer goods. Other informal sector activities include blacksmithing, leather-works, tailoring services, auto repairs, metal works, carpentry, tanning, dyeing, food processing, masonry etc. Even though modern industrial sector is yet to gain a solid footing, the seed for their development was planted through establishment of small-scale industries particularly in areas of food processing and other agro-allied activities such as the Jigawa ethanol programme. These industries have been helped by the Information Communication Technology program initiated by the Saminu Turaki, the states former governor. 4\n\nThe Federal Office of Statistics, in 2001, classified Jigawa State among those with relatively high severity and incidence of poverty in the country, with a Gross Per Capita Income of N35, 000 per annum (US$290), which is below the National Average; till date Jigawa State is being rate among the poorest states in Nigeria. However, the 2002 Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) Survey indicated that over two-fifths of the population do not consider themselves poor.\n\nThe State of infrastructure for economic development such as roads, electricity, telecommunication and information technology have recently witnessed tremendous improvements through massive rehabilitation and expansion works. With massive road rehabilitation projects already undertaken throughout the State during the last five years, coupled with efforts made towards power generation via Independent Power Platforms, and the Internet Broadband Project, investment climate in Jigawa State in terms of economic infrastructure is quite promising.\n\nEducation in Jigawa state is progressing well. Currently the state has a Federal University which is situated in the state capital, Dutse and a state-owned University situated at Kafin Hausa Local Government Area of the state. There is also Federal Polytechnic in Kazaure and a number of Monotechnics across the state. Established in 2011, Federal University Dutse is fast growing with number of applicants rapidly growing.\n\nGovernment of Jigawa State relates very well with multilateral agencies in the country particularly the World Bank, UNDP, UNICEF, DFID and other international donor agencies and NGOs. Multilateral agencies have been a veritable source of development funds and technical assistance to State Government. Presently, the State partners with DFID, UNDP, UNICEF, IBRD, IFAD, ADF and some other International Development Agencies in pursuit of several development projects and programmes, particularly in the sphere of pro-poor growth, poverty reduction, education, and positive reform programmes such as Public Expenditure Management, Health Systems and Justice System Reforms.\n\n"}
{"id": "2227637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227637", "title": "Kaduna State", "text": "Kaduna State\n\nKaduna State is the 18 state of Federal Republic of Nigeria located in the northwest zone of the country. It takes its name for the capital of Kaduna, hence it is usually referred to as Kaduna State to distinguish the two. It is ranked 4 by land area and 3 by population in Nigeria. The state capital was the former capital city of the British protectorate of Northern Nigeria region (1923-1966) after Zungeru (1903–1923) and Lokoja (1897–1903). Other major urban areas include Zaria, Kagoro, Kafanchan, Kachia, Nok, Makarfi, Birnin Gwari and Zonkwa.\n\nThe word \"Kaduna\" is said to be a corruption of the Hausa word '\"Kada' for “crocodile and the plural is \"Kadduna\" for crocodiles, as there were previously many crocodiles in the river Kaduna.” Another version of the etymology of the name is a narrative linked to the Gbagyi word/name 'Odna' for River Kaduna. in the coat of arm of the state there is a symbol of crocodile, and majority of emblem related to the state use crocodile as a symbol. The state football club Kaduna United F.C. use \"The Crocodiles\" as a nickname.\n\nIt is indicative that the name, Kaduna, was taken up by Lord Frederick Lugard and his colonial colleagues when they moved the capital of the then Northern Region from Zungeru to Kaduna city in 1916. This move of the colonial office to Kaduna city started in 1912-1918/20 with the initial effort having been made in 1902 from Jebba to Zungeru.\n\nAt the start of British colonial rule in northern Nigeria the people groups who live in the area became 'Northern Nigerians'- a construct which continues even today. By 1967 these people groups again were carved into 'North Central State'; this was the case until 1975 that 'Kaduna State' was formerly created by the then military leader, Gen. Murtala Mohammed, with all distinct identities amalgamated into one state without a referendum. The state hence is the successor of the old Northern Region of Nigeria, which had its capital at Kaduna which is now the state capital to about 6.3 million people (Nigerian census figure, 2006).\n\nIn 1967, the old Northern Region was divided into six states in the north, leaving Kaduna as the capital of North-Central State, whose name was changed to Kaduna State in 1976. Meanwhile, Kaduna State was further divided in 1987, creating Katsina State. Under the governance of Kaduna are the ancient cities of Zaria, Kafanchan, and Nok, the area where Africa's earliest civilization is recorded to have been excavated. The most intriguing aspect of this area is that the colonial construction and its post-colonial successor called 'Nigeria' hardly documented the history or the method of how Kaduna state's people groups encompassed in these constructs define and identify themselves as such the people groups who populate the area have lived in near oblivion or obscurity as they often are thought of as Hausa people. In 2019 Kaduna State celebrate 100 years anniversary, making it one of the oldest state in Nigeria.\n\nZazzau is said to have been founded since 1536 and later was renamed after the prominent Queen Zaria known as Amina, the Hausa people of Zaria are said to be the old ancestral of the region.\n\nThe state is located at the Northern part of Nigeria's High Plains. The vegetation cover is Sudan Savannah type, characterized by scattered short trees, shrubs and grasses. The soil is mostly loamy to sandy type. A substantial amount of clay is found also. Its northern half became Katsina state in 1987. The state is bordered by seven states. The state was ranked number four by total area of land and number three by population. The Kaduna River, a tributary of River Niger, flows through the state. There are rocky stones in Zaria and Kogoro Hill, a Hill that a lot of legendary stories are told about it. \nThe current governor of Kaduna state legally under the control of Kaduna State Excutives, Kaduna State House of Assembly and Kaduna State Judiciary the current elected governor of the state is Nasir Ahmad el-Rufai and his deputy Hadiza Sabuwa Balarabe In the state there 14 ministries that operate with the state government to improve the state, they are Ministries of Kaduna State.\n\nKaduna State consists of twenty-three (23) Local Government Areas. They are:\nThe Kaduna State economy was ranked 15th largest state in Nigerian economy from 2002 to 2008, and it made up 3.3% of Nigerian GDP. While agriculture contributed 30% of SGDP in Kaduna. Kaduna state cultivate cotton and peanuts (groundnuts) for exporting and domestic extraction of Peanut oil. In the state there is National Institute of Leather and Technology, to improve modern technology and traditional method.\n\nIn Kaduna State there are many means of communucation through mass media, broadcasting, internet communication and banking transaction, in Kaduna State there are a 21 radio stations and more than 4 television broadcasting, many of them are own by the state government or federal government and few are private, the following are list of radio stations in Kaduna. \n\nKaduna State is populated by about 59 to 63 different ethnic groups, if not more, with the exactitude of the number requiring further verification through genuine field work [Hayab, 2014]. The question as in the last paragraph with the Hausa and Fulani as the dominant ethnic groups followed by at least 60 others. These groups include:\n\nThe main religions in the area of Kaduna State are Christianity and Islam. while some minority ethnics practice traditional worshiping, mostly in the southern area of the state, the people living in kaduna state has a firm strong faith on the both side, as such cause two religious crisis in the state in 2001 and 2002 called Miss World riots. \n\nAvailable records show that Christian mission activities in the area began formally in the 1900s with the establishment of Sudan Interior Mission (S.I.M.) in the Ham town of Har Kwain (Kwoi), hence today these people groups are Mainly Christians. Culturally, the people groups of the then southern Zaria who are now Southern Kaduna, with some exception it must be acknowledged, share a lot in the cultural practices of marriage rites, naming, burial, farming, social organisations, kinship, etc. Until full scale research is undertaken, the diversity of Kaduna state remains blurred as some ethnic groups are so small in population that they are often overshadowed by the larger groups who live near them. There are several churches across the state this include Roman Catholic Diocese of Zaria, Roman Catholic Diocese of Zaria, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kaduna, Roman Catholic Diocese of Kafanchan and Megachurch.\n\nThe Muslims have their central mosque in Kaduna metropolis known as Sultan Bello Mosque .The Jama’t Izalat al Bid’a Wa Iqamat as Sunna and Jamatu Nasril Islam main branch is located in Kaduna metropolis. Also, the prominent Tijaniyyah leader Sheikh Dahiru Usman is in Kaduna, Furthermore,The Nigerian Islamic Movement (Nigeria) mover known as Ibrahim Zakzaky has his main branch in Zaria Kaduna State.\n\nOther languages in Kaduna State are Bacama, Firan, Sambe.\n\nKaduna is one of the largest centre of education in Nigeria, the slogan of the state is \"Center of Learning\" because of the present of many institution like; Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria. There are many government school, include primary schools and secondary schools, all secondary schols in kaduna is own by either the state government, federal government or private organisation. there are many tertiary institution in the state. Zaria has the Ahmadu Bello University established (1962). Yhe state also has colleges for transportation and agriculture. \n\n\n\nThe National Museum which was built in (1975) with archaeological and ethnographic exhibitions, the Kajuru Castle, Lugard Hall, Zaria walls and Gates and Nok settlements . in the state there are many architectural buildings like Ten storey, Ahmadu Bello Stadium, Murtala Square, Investment house, kaduna central market, Sultan Bello Mosque and so on. The palace of emire of Zazzau is one the oldest traditional buildings in Kaduna state.\nIn Kaduna State there are a lot of ethnic groups, which lead to the variation of culture and architectural style, this include the city wall of Zaria.

The diameter of the aperture of the main objective is a common criterion for comparison among optical systems, such as large telescopes.\n\nThe two traditional systems are mirror-systems (catoptrics) and lens-systems (dioptrics), although in the late twentieth century, optical fiber was introduced. Catoptrics and dioptrics have a focal point, while optical fiber transfers an image from one plane to another without an optical focus.\n\nIsaac Newton is reported to have designed what he called a \"catadioptrical phantasmagoria\", which can be interpreted to mean an elaborate structure of both mirrors and lenses.\n\nCatoptrics and optical fiber have no chromatic aberration, while dioptrics need to have this error corrected. Newton believed that such correction was impossible, because he thought the path of the light depended only on its color. In 1757 John Dollond was able to create an achromatised dioptric, which was the forerunner of the lenses used in all popular photographic equipment today.\n\nLower-energy X-Rays are the highest energy electromagnetic radiation that can be formed into an image, using a Wolter telescope. There are three types of Wolter telescopes Near infrared is typically the longest wavelength that are handled optically, such as in some large telescopes.\n"}

According to recent research based on local oral traditions, king lists and on the Kebbi chronicle, the state of Kebbi was founded towards 600 BCE by refugees of the Assyrian empire conquered by Babylonian and Median forces in 612 BCE.

As of 2005 it has an estimated population of more than 4.2 million. Sokoto City is the modern-day capital of Sokoto State (and its predecessor, the Northwestern State).\n\nThe name Sokoto (which is the modern/anglicised version of the local name, Sakkwato) is of Arabic origin, representing suk, \"market\". It is also known as Sakkwato, Birnin Shaihu da Bello or \"Sokoto, Capital of Shaihu and Bello\").\n\nBeing the seat of the former Sokoto Caliphate, the city is predominantly Muslim and an important seat of Islamic learning in Nigeria. The Sultan who heads the caliphate is effectively the spiritual leader of Nigerian Muslims.\n\nSince its creation as a state in 1976 (from the bifurcation of the erstwhile North-Western State (Map) into Sokoto and Niger States, Sokoto state has been ruled by governors, most ex-military officers, who succeeded each another at short intervals.\n\nSokoto, as a region, knows a longer history. During the reign of the Fulani Empire in the 19th century Sokoto was an important Fula state, in addition to being a city, of what was then west central Nigeria.\n\nFrom ca. 1900, with the British take-over, Sokoto, which then encompassed the entire north-west corner of Nigeria, became a province of the British protectorate of Nigeria. Not long after Gando was added as a sub-province. This double province then covered an area of with an estimated population over 500,000. It included the then Zamfara and Argungun, or Kebbi, kingdoms.\n\nThe following excerpt from the 1911 \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" offers some information from the perspective of the occupying British power:\n\nIn 1967, not long after Nigeria's independence from the British, the region became known as the Northwestern State. This territory was, in 1976, split into Sokoto State and Niger State. Later on, Kebbi State (1991) and Zamfara State (1996) split off from Sokoto State.\n\nSokoto State is mainly populated by Hausa people. Most Sokoto State residents are Sunni Muslims, with a Shia minority; violence between the two groups is uncommon. Over 80% of people living in the state practice agriculture.\n\nSokoto State is in the dry Sahel, surrounded by sandy savannah and isolated hills.\n\nWith an annual average temperature of , Sokoto is, on the whole, a very hot area. However, maximum daytime temperatures are for most of the year generally under and the dryness makes the heat bearable. The warmest months are February to April when daytime temperatures can exceed . The rainy season is from June to October during which showers are a daily occurrence. The showers rarely last long and are a far cry from the regular torrential rain known in wet tropical regions. From late October to February, during the \"cold season\", the climate is dominated by the Harmattan wind blowing Sahara dust over the land. The dust dims the sunlight thereby lowering temperatures significantly and also leading to the inconvenience of dust everywhere in houses.\n\nThe region's lifeline for growing crops is the floodplains of the Sokoto-Rima river system (see Sokoto River), which are covered with rich alluvial soil. For the rest, the general dryness of the region allows for few crops, millet perhaps being the most abundant, complemented by rice, corn, other cereals and beans. Apart from tomatoes few vegetables grow in the region.\n\nSokoto State consists of twenty-three (23) Local Government Areas. They are:\n\n"}

Its capital is Gusau and its Governor is Bello Matawalle, a member of the People's Democratic Party (PDP). Until 1996, the area was part of Sokoto State.\n\nZamfara is populated with the Hausa and Fulani peoples. Major groups of people are the Zamfarawa mainly in Anka, Gummi, Bukkuyum and Talata Mafara Local Governments areas. Gobirawa populated Shinkafi Local Government. Gobirawa actually migrated from the Gobir Kingdom. Burmawa are found in Bakura and Fulani peopled Bungudu, Maradun, Gusau and are scattered all over the State. In Tsafe, Bungudu and Maru Local Governments are mainly Katsinawa, Garewatawa and Hadejawa. While Alibawa peopled Kaura Namoda and Zurmi.\n\nThe people of Zamfara have over the years struggled for autonomy, it was not until 1996 that the then military administration of the Late General Sani Abacha detached the Zamfara State from Sokoto State. With an area of 38,418 square kilometres, it is bordered in the North by Niger republic, to the South by Kaduna State. In the east, it is bordered by Katsina State and to the West by Sokoto and Niger States. It has a population of 3,278,873 according to the 2006 census and contains fourteen local government areas.\n\nThe area today called Zamfara state was one of the old Hausa city-states like Kano, Katsina, Gobir, Kabi and Zazzau. The earliest inhabitants of Zamfara were said to have been hunters and giants. They established their first settlement at Dutsi which was the first capital of Zamfara. It extends up to the bend of River Rima to the north west and River Ka in the south west. Zamfara Kingdom was established in the 11th century and flourished up to 16th century as a city-state. Its capital has shifted with the fortunes of the kingdom from place to place like Dutsi and Birnin Zamfara. In the first half of the 18th century, its then capital Birnin Zamfara, was destroyed by the Gobir Kingdom and a new capital was established in Anka by the second half of the 19th century. Zamfara had many centers of commerce and scholarship that attracted many scholars like the Yandoto city. It became part of the Sokoto Caliphate after the 1804 jihad by Usman dan Fodio. In fact, Usman Danfodiyo settled in Sabon Gari where Sarkin Zamfara Abarshi had already established a garrison headquarters during the early days of his Jihad as a base from where fought Gobir and Kabi.\n\nAt the wake of British colonialism, the emerging town of Gusau became an important commercial and administrative center with road and rail networks passing through it. With the creation of states during the Gowon Administration, Zamfara Kingdom became part of the then North West state and later the Sokoto State.\n\nThe climatic condition of Zamfara is tropical, with temperatures rising up to and above between March to May. Rainy season starts in late May to September while the mild season known as Harmattan lasts from December to February.\n\nZamfara State consists of fourteen (14) Local Government Areas. They are: \n\nZamfara State is mainly populated by Hausa and Fulani people, with some members of Gwari, Kamuku, Kambari, Dukawa, Bussawa and Zabarma ethnic communities. Others include the Igbo, Yoruba, Kanuri, Nupe and Tiv.\n\nThe state capital is an important commercial center with a heterogeneous population of people from all over Nigeria. As in all major towns in Nigeria, all the major towns in Zamfara have a large population of other peoples from different parts of Nigeria.\n\nThe Kainji languages C'Lela and Gwamhi-Wuri are spoken in Gummi LGA. Ut-Ma'in is also spoken in the state and in Kebbe, Sokoto State. Major languages are Hausa and Fulani.\n\nAgriculture is the main occupation of the people of the state and the central source of income. Irrigation is required for cereals and legumes hence its slogan \"farming is our pride\".\nAnd also \"Home Of Shari'ah.\"\n\nIn 2009, gold mining became a greater source of income in Zamfara State as worldwide gold prices rose dramatically. High concentrations of lead in the ore from which gold was being extracted led to a lead poisoning epidemic in the state, requiring national and international intervention to remediate affected areas and provide medical care to children with severe lead poisoning.\n\nIslam is the principal and major religion of the state. Zamfara was the first state in Nigeria to introduce Sharia law during the regime of Ahmad Sani Yerima, the former Governor of the state. Christianity also has many adherents. The original native religions also remain but they have the fewest followers. These religions are mainly practiced in ancient settlements like Dutsi and Kwatarkwashi.\n\nHausa is the official language of the state. Other main languages spoken in Zamfara are English, French, Fulfulde, Arabic; minority populations also speak languages like: Yoruba and Igbo.\n\n\n"}

It is the entrance aria of the title character, a mezzo-soprano role, in scene 5 of the first act.\n\nThe score of the aria was adapted from the habanera \"El Arreglito ou la Promesse de mariage\", by the Spanish musician Sebastián Iradier, first published in 1863, which Bizet thought to be a folk song. When others told him he had used something written by a composer who had died 10 years earlier, he added a note of its derivation in the first edition of the vocal score which he himself prepared. Although the French libretto of the complete opéra comique was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy, the words of the habanera originated from Bizet. The Habanera was first performed by Galli-Marié at the Opéra-Comique on 3 March 1875. Bizet, having removed during rehearsals his first version of Carmen's entrance song, in with a refrain in , rewrote the Habanera several times before he (and Galli-Marié) were satisfied with it.\n\n<score raw=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\\header { \n\\score {\n</score>\n\nAlthough Bizet kept the basic layout of the Iradier song, which has each verse in D minor and each refrain in the tonic major, he let go of the long ritornelli and second half material, and by adding chromaticism, variations in the refrain and harmonic interest in the accompaniment, made it a memorable number. The reharmonization, addition of triplets in the vocal line and the flute in its low register add to the effect. Despite the change in mode there is no actual modulation in the aria, and the implied pedal point D is maintained throughout. The vocal range covers D to F with a tessitura from D to D. Although Bizet borrowed the melody from a song by Iradier he developed it \"with his inimitable harmonic style and haunting habanera rhythm\".\n\nThe orchestration for the number consists of the two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, timpani, triangle and tambourine, full strings, and pistons (for the final chord only). The orchestral complement for the premiere run was 62 or 57 musicians in total (depending on whether the pit players doubled for off-stage music).\n\nJosé is the only person on stage who pays no attention to Carmen while she sings the Habanera, and after she finishes she approaches him, and at the end of the following short scene, after Carmen's spoken words \"épinglier de mon âme\" and her throwing a cassia flower at José, the female chorus reprise the refrain \"L'amour est enfant de bohème, Il n'a jamais, jamais connu de loi, Si tu ne m'aimes pas, je t'aime, Si je t'aime, prends garde à toi !\". The refrain also returns briefly at the end of the act, in scene XI, No.1 Final where Carmen hums it ('fredonnant') in the face of the lieutenant Zuniga.\n\nLyrics in parentheses are sung by the chorus.\n\n<poem lang=\"fr\" style=\"float:left;\">[recitative]\nQuand je vous aimerai ?\nMa foi, je ne sais pas,\nPeut-être jamais, peut-être demain...\nMais pas aujourd'hui, c'est certain !\n\n[sung]\nL'amour est un oiseau rebelle\nQue nul ne peut apprivoiser,\nEt c'est bien en vain qu'on l'appelle,\nS'il lui convient de refuser.\nRien n'y fait, menace ou prière,\nL'un parle bien, l'autre se tait,\nEt c'est l'autre que je préfère,\nIl n'a rien dit, mais il me plaît.\n\n(L'amour est un oiseau rebelle) L'amour !\n(Que nul ne peut apprivoiser,) L'amour !\n(Et c'est bien en vain qu'on l'appelle,) L'amour !\n(S'il lui convient de refuser.)

The N4 heads north from the Tetteh Quarshie Interchange, while the N6 originates from Achimota. These highways cut through the northern part of the region and terminate at Kumasi in the Ashanti Region.\n\nThere is also an active railway line connecting Accra and Tema.\n\nGreater Accra has three public four-year institutions, the University of Ghana in Accra, Ghana Institute of Journalism and University of Professional Studies, East Legon, Accra. In addition, there are number of private universities and university colleges spread through the region.\n\n\n\nThe political administration of the region is through the local government system. Under this administration system, the region is divided into 16 districts, as of June 2012 addition of 6 district areas. Each District, Municipal or Metropolitan Area, is administered by a Chief Executive, representing the central government but deriving authority from an Assembly headed by a presiding member elected from among the members themselves.\n"}

It is located in the north of the country and was the largest of the sixteen regions, covering an area of 70,384 square kilometres or 31 percent of Ghana's area until December 2018 when the Savannah Region and North East Regions were created from it. The Northern Region is divided into 14 districts. The region's capital is Tamale.\n\nThe Northern Region is bordered on the north by the North East region, on the east by the eastern Ghana-Togo international border, on the south by the Oti region, and on the west by the Savannah Region. Northern region is made up of 14 districts.\n\nThe Northern Region is much drier than southern areas of Ghana, due to its proximity to the Sahel, and the Sahara. The vegetation consists predominantly of grassland, especially savanna with clusters of drought-resistant trees such as baobabs or acacias. Between January and March is the dry season. The wet season is between about July and December with an average annual rainfall of 750 to 1050 mm (30 to 40 inches). The highest temperatures are reached at the end of the dry season, the lowest in December and January. However, the hot Harmattan wind from the Sahara blows frequently between December and the beginning of February. The temperatures can vary between 14 °C (59 °F) at night and 40 °C (104 °F) during the day.\n\nMore than 75% of the economically active population are agricultural. The low population density is partly caused by emigration, in addition to geography and climate.\n\nThe Northern Region has a low population density, and, along with the official language of English, most inhabitants (52%) speak a language of the Oti–Volta subfamily in the Niger–Congo language family, such as Dagbani, Mamprusi or Konkomba. The Dagbon Kingdom, of the Dagomba people, is located in the region.\n\n\nAround three out of five residents in the Northern region were affiliated to Islam (60.0%). \n\nThe Northern Region of Ghana contains 16 districts. 11 are ordinary districts in addition to 1 metropolitan and 4 municipal districts.:\n\n\n"}

It is located west of Republic of Togo and to the east of Lake Volta. Divided into 25 administrative districts, the region is multi-ethnic and multilingual, including groups such as the Ewe, the Guan, and the Akan peoples. The Guan peoples include the Lolobi, Likpe, Akpafu, Buem, and Nkonya( now part of Oti region) people, et al.\n\nThe Volta region was formed by the state union of the former British Togoland which was part of the German protectorate of Togoland. It was administered as part of the Gold Coast by the British and later renamed Trans-Volta Togoland.\n\nThe native and largest ethnic group of the Volta Region (Togoland / British Togoland) are the Ewe people (68.5% of the population). They consist of several sub groups such as the Anlo Ewe, Tongu Ewe, Wedome and Avenor Ewe. Other ethnicities include the Guan people (forming 9.2% of the population), the Akan people (8.5%), and the Gurma people (6.5% of the population). \n\nThe Volta region is run by a Regional Coordinating Council (RCC) and a District Assembly. The RCC is made up of the Volta Regional Minister who is the political head and his deputy as well as representatives of the \"Regional House of Chiefs\", the \"District Chief Executives\" of the Volta region, the Presiding Members of the 12 Districts Assemblies and representatives of the various decentralized Ministries, Departments and Agencies in the Volta region. Each district is run by a District Assembly.\n\nThe current Regional Minister, Archibald Letsa was appointed in February 2017.\n\nBefore the regional demarcation in December 2018, the region had 25 districts consisting of 5 municipal and 20 ordinary districts with all the administrative changes as of December 2012. After the census, the Oti Region was carved out of it, reducing the size of the region and the number of administrative districts to 18.\n\nThe following districts are now within the boundaries of the Oti Region which was formally created on 15 February 2019.\n\nThe Volta Region had 19 constituencies in the election in December 2000 and 24 constituencies in December 2004 parliamentary election. Four new constituencies were created by the Electoral Commission prior to the December 2012 parliamentary election, increasing the number of constituencies to 26. \n\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThe Togoland Congress (TCP) was a political party formed in 1951 to campaign for the unification of the Ewe people in British Togoland and French Togoland as a separate Ewe state. The party was defeated in the May 1956 UN plebiscite in British Togoland, which resulted in the unification of British Trans-Volta Togoland with Gold Coast, which later became independent as Ghana.\n\nOn 9 May 1956, a vote was conducted to decide the future disposition of British Togoland and French Togoland. The native and dominant ethnic group, the Ewe people, were divided between the two Togos. British Togoland inhabitants voted in favor of state union with the Gold Coast, and the Togo Ewe state was incorporated with Gold Coast.\n\nThere was vocal opposition to the incorporation of Togoland into modern Ghana, from the Ewe people who voted (42%) against in British Togoland, as the Ewe wanted the unification of the Ewe people in British Togoland and French Togoland as a separate Ewe state (modern Togo).\n\nRecently, a campaign for the cessation of some part of the Volta Region from Ghana to be known as \"Western Togoland\" is being led by a group calling itself Homeland Study Group Foundation. The group is led by Charles Kormi Kudzodzi.\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the game's storyline, the United States is unable to respond to the attack directly due to the dismantlement of its nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe game is famous in Finland due to the political effect of its content. A leftist member of the Finnish parliament went as far as to make a parliamentary question about whether it was acceptable to sell the game. The resulting debate and publicity made the game a top seller in the country.\n\nThe game opens with an alert that a nuclear missile has been launched from a Soviet city towards a North American city. The game begins in the hangar where the American spaceplanes are stored. The player has to safely fly the craft out. The view switches to the earth as seen from low Earth orbit, and the player guides the spaceplane to the city launching the attack. Alternatively, the player may decide to maneuver more of the available spaceships out of the space station before attacking the launch site; the surplus ships are docked outside the space station. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking, and the time before impact is continually displayed.\n\nThe player has then to fly through the defense perimeter around the launch site missile silo, dodging obstacles, heat-seeking missiles, and Soviet tanks and planes. If successful, the player proceeds to the next screen; otherwise, the player has to start the next life back at the hangar, with the clock still ticking. However, should the player have spare spaceplanes parked outside the space station, the game continues with a new life at the current screen, skipping the flight from space station to the launch site. The decision to launch more than a single spaceship first may therefore save time if the player later loses a life.\n\nThe final part of this stage involves destroying the missile silo while avoiding Soviet planes trying to shoot down the player. Destroying the primary missile silo in the center before the missile lands will thwart the attack. Destroying the secondary silos on either side of the primary earns extra lives and points.\n\nThe Soviets launch a total of four missile attacks, from Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, and Saratov, all of which must be stopped in the same manner as the first. After the fourth launch, the player progresses to the second stage of the game.\n\nThe pilots become foot soldiers and are placed outside the front facade of the \"Defence Centre\", depicted as the State Historical Museum. Using a mortar they must blast open the correct door to the facility, randomly chosen from five available. Bonus points can be gained from this section by destroying parts of the building and defeating the troops stationed there. Once the door is open, the soldiers make their way to the nuclear reactor, and the final stage of the game.\n\nIn this stage, the player has to destroy maintenance robots that feed coolant into the reactor. The number of robots is determined by the difficulty level chosen by the player. The player is provided with several disc grenades that he throws at the robot, which is moving and firing at him the entire time. The robot is reinforced at the front, so the only way to do any damage is to bounce the discs off the wall and hit the robot in the back. As the number of discs is limited, the player should attempt to catch returning discs which missed the robot. To successfully complete the game, all robots must be defeated, the final one within a two-minute time limit. If the robot is not destroyed within the limit the game is still considered complete, but with no survivors.\n\nThe game was first published for the Commodore 64 with Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Atari 8-bit, BBC Micro, and ZX Spectrum versions following. Upon reissue the game was retitled to Raid.\n\nAn Amiga port was in development in the late 1980s but was cancelled along with Beach Head and when the developers were unable to secure a deal with the publisher, U.S. Gold. According to the graphical artist Adrian Cummings, the graphics were at that point \"99.9% complete\". However the coding was barely started.\n\n\"Raid over Moscow\" was Access' second best-selling Commodore game as of late 1987, after \"Beach-Head\". The game received generally positive reviews. Computer and Video Games praised the graphics and sound of the Commodore 64 version, while Crash gave the ZX Spectrum version an overall score of 92%. The theme of the game, nuclear war, was subject to questioning, however, with Computer and Video Games publishing several letters from readers arguing for and against its publication.\n\nUnauthorized copies of \"Raid on Moscow\" circulated widely in East Germany during the 1980s, despite the Stasi describing it as among those games having \"a particularly militaristic and inhumane nature\". The West German Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons added the game to its index in 1985, stating that \"In older adolescents, playing (...) can lead to physical tension, anger, aggressiveness, agitated thinking, difficulty concentrating, headaches, etc.\" The ban automatically ended in 2010.\n\nThe game was shortly presented in YLE's current affairs television programme \"A-studio\" on after being reviewed by the computer magazine \"MikroBitti\". On the leftist newspaper \"Tiedonantaja\" published an article which criticized the review and called a ban on all similar \"anti-USSR\" games. Parliament member Ensio Laine (SKDL) left a parliamentary question for the Finnish government on the next day.\nThe following days included various discussions between the Finnish foreign ministry and Soviet Union representatives. On , an unofficial petition was received from the USSR, asking for a ban on various books, articles and other media, including \"Raid Over Moscow\", which were supposed to purport a distorted view on the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, on , Minister of foreign trade Jermu Laine answered the parliamentary question, claiming that the Finnish legislation only allowed to restrict the import on products that constitute a hazard on health. The foreign ministry thus was able to dodge possible claims of Finlandization by referring to unsuitable legislation. Finally, Minister of foreign affairs Paavo Väyrynen gave an official answer to the petition on , expressing a friendly attitude towards the USSR and apologizing on behalf of negative publications about the country on the media. The USSR interpreted the game as military propaganda, but settled on the answer.\n\nAs a result of the public debate, the game was the top selling Commodore 64 game in Finland from March to September 1985 according to \"MikroBitti\". The full extent of the affair was unveiled in 2010, when the Finnish foreign ministry memos were declassified.\n\n"}

He was the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia from 1993 until his death in 1999. According to French political scientist Gilles Kepel, Baz was a \"figurehead\" whose \"immense religious erudition and his reputation for intransigence\" gave him prestige among the population of Saudi Arabia and he \"could reinforce the Saud family's policies through his influence with the masses of believers\", and his death left the government without a comparable figure from within the Salafi clergy to \"fill his shoes\".\n\nBin Baz issued a fatwa authorizing a wealth tax to support the Mujahideen during the anti-Soviet jihad. His endorsement of \"In Defense of Muslim Lands\", principally written by Abdullah Azzam, was a powerful influence in the successful call for jihad against the Soviet Union. It is said to be the first official call for jihad by a nation state against another nation state in modern times.\n\nMany of Ibn Baz's views and rulings are considered controversial (both inside and outside Saudi Arabia), including those relating to cosmology, women's rights, Saudi Arabia's support for the Oslo Accords, and the acceptability of stationing non-Islamic troops in the Land of the Two Holy Mosques (\"Haramayn\") during and after the Persian Gulf War. Osama bin Laden bitterly condemned Bin Baz and his rulings that supported Saudi Arabia's foreign policy and alliances with Western powers.\n\nIbn Baz was born in the city of Riyadh during the month of Dhu al-Hijjah, 1910 to a family with a reputation for their interest in Islam. His father died when he was only three. By the time he was thirteen he had begun working, selling clothing with his brother in a market. He also took lessons of the Qur’an, Hadith, Fiqh, and Tafsir, with the man who would precede him as the country's top religious official, Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al ash-Sheikh. In 1927, when he was sixteen, he started losing his eyesight after being afflicted with a serious infection in his eyes. By the time he was twenty, he had totally lost his sight and had become blind.\n\nAt that time, Saudi Arabia lacked a modern university system. Ibn Baz received a traditional education in Islamic literature with Islamic scholars.\n\nHe had assumed a number of posts and responsibilities such as:\n\nIn 1981 he was awarded the King Faisal International Prize for Service to Islam. He was the only Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia not to come from the Al ash-Sheikh family.\n\nIbn Bāz had undertaken a number of charitable and other activities such as:\nIbn Bāz was considered by many to be prolific speaker both in public and privately at his mosque. He also used to invite people after Isha prayer to share a meal with him. Ibn Bāz was among the Muslim scholars who opposed regime change using violence. He called for obedience to the people in power unless they ordered something that went against God.\n\nThe number of books written by Ibn Bāz exceeds sixty and the subject matter covered topics such as Hadith, Tafsir, Fara'ed, Tawheed, Fiqh, Salat, Zakat, Dawah, Hajj and Umrah. He also authored a criticism of the concept of nationhood.\n\nHis wives and children lived in the Shumaysi neighborhood of Riyadh in \"a little cluster of modern two-story buildings\". Like all senior Saudi clerics, his home was a gift from a wealthy benefactor or a religious foundation for his distinguished religious work.\n\nOn Thursday morning, 13 May 1999, Ibn Bāz died at the age of 88. He was buried in Al Adl cemetery, Mecca.\n\nKing Fahd issued a decree appointing Abdul-Azeez ibn Abdullaah Aal ash-Shaikh as the new Grand Mufti after Ibn Bāz's death.\n\nIn his career as the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, he attempted to both legitimize the rule of the ruling family and to support calls for the reform of Islam in line with Salafi ideals. Many criticized him for supporting the Saudi government when, after the Persian Gulf War, it muzzled or imprisoned those regarded as too critical of the government, such as Safar al-Hawali and Salman al-Ouda. His influence on the Salafi movement was large, and most of the prominent judges and religious scholars of Saudi Arabia today are former students of his.\n\nHis obituary in \"The Independent\" said \"His views and fatwas (religious rulings) were controversial, condemned by militants, liberals and progressives alike\". He was also criticized by hardline Salafists and jihadists for supporting the decision to permit U.S. troops to be stationed in Saudi Arabia in 1991.\n\nIn 1966, when Ibn Baz was vice-president of the Islamic University of Medina, he wrote an article denouncing Riyadh University for teaching the \"falsehood\" that the earth rotates and orbits the sun. In his article, ibn Baz did claim that the sun orbited the earth, and that \"the earth is fixed and stable, spread out by God for mankind and made a bed and cradle for them, fixed down by mountains lest it shake\". As a result of the publication of his first article, ibn Baz was ridiculed by Egyptian journalists as an example of Saudi primitiveness, and King Faisal was reportedly so angered by the first article that he ordered the destruction of every unsold copy of the two papers that had published it. In 1982 Ibn Baz published a book, \"Al-adilla al-naqliyya wa al-ḥissiyya ʿala imkān al-ṣuʾūd ila al-kawākib wa ʾala jarayān al-shams wa al-qamar wa sukūn al-arḍ\" (\"Treatise on the textual and rational proofs of the rotation of the sun and the motionlessness of the earth and the possibility of ascension to other planets\"). In it, he republished the 1966 article, together with a second article on the same subject written later in 1966, and repeated his belief that the sun orbited the earth. In 1985, he changed his mind concerning the rotation of the earth (and, according to Lacey, ceased to assert its flatness), when Prince Sultan bin Salman returned home after a week aboard the space shuttle \"Discovery\" to tell him that he had seen the earth rotate.\n\nIn addition, there was controversy concerning the nature of the takfir (the act of declaring other Muslims to be kafir or unbelievers) which it was claimed Ibn Baz had pronounced. According to Malise Ruthven, he threatened all who did not accept his \"pre-Copernican\" views with a fatwa, declaring them infidels. Ibn Baz wrote a letter to a magazine in 1966 responding to similar accusations:\n\nI only deemed it lawful to kill whoever claims that the sun is static (thābita la jāriya) and refuses to repent of this after clarification. This is because denying the circulation of the sun constitutes a denial of Allah (Glorified be He), His Great Book, and His Honorable Messenger. It is well established in the Din (religion of Islam) by way of decisive evidence and Ijma` (consensus) of scholars that whoever denies Allah, His Messenger or His Book is a Kafir (disbeliever) and their blood and wealth become violable. It is the duty of the responsible authority to ask them to repent of this; either they repent or be executed. Thanks to Allah that this issue is not debatable among scholars.\n\nIbn Baz's second article written in 1966 also responded to similar accusations:\n\nI did not declare those who believe that the earth rotates to be infidels, nor those who believe that the sun moving around itself, but I do so for those who say that the sun is static and does not move (thābita la jāriya), which is in my last article. Whoever says so being an infidel is obvious from the Quran and the Sunnah, because God almighty says: 'And the sun runs on (tajri) to a term appointed for it' ... As for saying that the Sun is fixed in one position but still moving around itself, ..., I did not deal with this issue in my first article, nor have I declared as infidel anyone who says so.\nWestern writers subsequently have drawn parallels between their perception of ibn Baz and the trial of Galileo by the Catholic Church in the 16th century.\n\nBin Baz is often said to have believed that the Earth was flat. Author Robert Lacey says that Bin Baz gave an interview \"in which he mused on how we operate day to day on the basis that the ground beneath us is flat ... and it led him to the belief that he was not afraid to voice and for which he became notorious.\" Though satirized for his belief, \"the sheikh was unrepentant. If Muslims chose to believe the world was round, that was their business, he said, and he would not quarrel with them religiously. But he was inclined to trust what he felt beneath his feet rather than the statements of scientists he did not know.\" According to Lacey, bin Baz changed his mind about the earth's flatness after talking to Prince Sultan bin Salman Al Saud who had spent time in a space shuttle flight in 1985.\nHowever, Malise Ruthven and others state that it is incorrect to report that Ibn Baz believed \"the earth is flat\" Professor Werner Ende, a German expert on ibn Baz's fatwas, states he has never asserted this. Abd al-Wahhâb al-Turayrî calls those that attribute the flat earth view to ibn Baz \"rumor mongers\". He points out that ibn Baz issued a fatwa declaring that the Earth is round, and, indeed, in 1966 ibn Baz wrote \"The quotation I cited [in his original article] from the speech of the great scholar Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah be merciful to him) includes proof that the earth is round.\"\n\nLacey quotes a fatwa by bin Baz urging caution towards claims that the Americans had landed on the moon. \"We must make careful checks whenever the \"kuffar\" [unbelievers] or \"faseqoon\" [immoral folk] tell us something: we cannot believe or disbelieve them until we get sufficient proof on which the Muslims can depend.\"\n\nBin Baz has been associated with some members of the 20 November–4 December 1979 takeover of the Grand Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) in Mecca. The two-week-long armed takeover left over 250 dead, including hostages taken by the militants. According to interviews taken by author Robert Lacey, the militants (known as Beit Al-Ikhwan) led by Juhayman al-Otaybi, were students of bin Baz and other high ulema. Juhayman declared his brother-in-law, Mohammed al-Qahtani, to be the Mahdi. The Mabahith (secret police) of the minister of interior Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz Al Saud had identified Mohammed al-Qahtani and a number of the Ikhwan as troublemakers. They had got them all safely locked up months before -- only to release them at the request of Sheikh Bin Baz.\nIslam forbids any violence within the Grand Mosque. Ibn Baz found himself in a delicate situation, especially as he had previously taught al-Otaybi in Medina. The situation was compounded and complicated by the fact the Saudi government found itself unprepared and incapable of dislodging the militants from the Mosque. They asked for outside assistance from the non-Islamic French GIGN and non-Arab Pakistani SSG. Non-Muslims are not permitted within the Meccan city limits, let alone the Grand Mosque. When asked for a fatwa by the government to condemn the militants, the language of bin Baz and other senior ulama \"was curiously restrained.\" The invaders of the Masjid al-Haram were not declared non-Muslims, despite their killings and violation of the sanctity of the Masjid, but only called \"\"al-jamaah al-musallahah\"\" (the armed group). Regardless, the ulema issued a fatwa allowing deadly force to be used in retaking the mosque.\nThe senior scholars also insisted that before security forces attack them, the authorities must offer the option 'to surrender and lay down their arms.' Bin Baz, through a loophole, issued another fatwa allowing the French Special Operations Forces to do a last minute, if only temporary, conversion to Islam, to be able to enter the city and the Grand Mosque to shed the blood of militants Bin Baz refused to condemn as non-Muslim.\n\nIbn Baz has been described as having harsh and inflexible attitudes towards women and being a bulwark against the expansion of rights for women. Commenting on the Sharia rule that the testimony in court of one woman was insufficient, Ibn Baz said: \"The Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) explained that their shortcoming in reasoning is found in the fact that their memory is weak and that their witness is in need of another woman to corroborate it.\" He also issued a fatwa against women driving cars, which in the West may have been his most well known ruling. He declared: \"Depravity leads to the innocent and pure women being accused of indecencies. Allah has laid down one of the harshest punishments for such an act to protect society from the spreading of the causes of depravity. Women driving cars, however, is one of the causes that lead to that.\"\n\nDuring the Persian Gulf War Ibn Bāz issued a fatwa allowing the deployment of non-Muslim troops on Saudi Arabian soil to defend the kingdom from the Iraqi army. Some noted that this was in contrast to his opinion in the 1940s, when he contradicted the government policy of allowing non-Muslims to be employed on Saudi soil. However, according to \"The New York Times\", his fatwa overruled more radical clerics. In response to criticism, ibn Baz condemned those who \"whisper secretly in their meetings and record their poison over cassettes distributed to the people.\"\n\nAnother key issue was to allow the wearing of the cross by non-Muslim soldiers and the carrying of New Testaments into battle against other Muslims from the holiest land in Islam. This ruling shook Saudi society like an earthquake, and remains at the heart of many violent disputes Salafi jihadis have with the House of Saud till this day.\n\nThe radical cleric Abdullah el-Faisal declared Bin Baz \"takfir\" (a Muslim traitor) who died unrepentant.\n\nAccording to his obituary in \"The Independent\", Ibn Baz held ultra-conservative views and strongly maintained the puritan and non-compromising traditions of Wahabism. However, his views were not strict enough for Osama bin Laden who condemned ibn Baz for \"his weakness and flexibility and the ease of influencing him with the various means which the interior ministry practices\". Ibn Bāz was the subject of Osama bin Laden's first public pronouncement intended for the general Muslim public. This open letter condescendingly criticized him for endorsing the Oslo peace accord between the PLO and Israeli government. Ibn Baz defended his decision to endorse the Oslo Accords by citing the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, saying that a peace treaty with non-Muslims has historical precedent if it can avoid the loss of life.\n\nIbn Baz deemed it mandatory to destroy media that promoted Bin Laden's views, and declared that it was forbidden for anyone to co-operate with him. He wrote:\n\n...It is obligatory to destroy and annihilate these publications that have emanated from al-Faqeeh, or from al-Mas'aree, or from others of the callers of falsehood (bin Laadin and those like him), and not to be lenient towards them. And it is obligatory to advise them, to guide them towards the truth, and to warn them against this falsehood. It is not permissible for anyone to co-operate with them in this evil. And it is obligatory upon them to be sincere and to come back to guidance and to leave alone and abandon this falsehood. So my advice to al-Mas'aree, al-Faqeeh and Bin Laadin and all those who traverse their ways is to leave alone this disastrous path, and to fear Allaah and to beware of His vengeance and His Anger, and to return to guidance and to repent to Allaah for whatever has preceded from them. And Allaah, Glorified, has promised His repentant servants that He will accept their repentance and be good to them. So Allah the Glorified said: \"Say, 'O My servants who have transgressed against themselves. Do not despair of the Mercy of Allaah; verily, Allaah forgives all sins.' Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\" [39:53].\n\n\n\n"}

The Ford Escort name was also applied to several small car types produced in North America by Ford between 1981 and 2004.\n\nIn 2014, Ford revived the Escort name for a car based on the second-generation Ford Focus sold on the Chinese market.\n\nThe first use of the \"Ford Escort\" name was for a reduced specification version of the Ford Squire, a 1950s estate car version of the British Ford Anglia 100E.\nThe Mark I Ford Escort was introduced in Ireland and the United Kingdom at the end of 1967, making its show debut at the Brussels Motor Show in January 1968. It replaced the successful, long-running Anglia. The car was presented in continental Europe as a product of Ford's European operation. Escort production commenced at the Halewood plant in England during the closing months of 1967, and for left hand drive markets during September 1968 at the Ford plant in Genk. Initially the continental Escorts differed slightly under the skin from the UK built ones. The front suspension and steering gear were differently configured and the brakes were fitted with dual hydraulic circuits; also the wheels fitted on the Genk-built Escorts had wider rims. At the beginning of 1970, continental European production transferred to a new plant on the edge of Saarlouis, West Germany.\n\nThe Escort was a commercial success in several parts of western Europe, but nowhere more than in the UK, where the national best seller of the 1960s, BMC's Austin/Morris 1100 was beginning to show its age while Ford's own Cortina had grown, both in dimensions and in price, beyond the market niche at which it had originally been pitched. It also competed with the Vauxhall Viva, and from early 1970 the Rootes Group's Hillman Avenger.\n\nIn June 1974, six years into the car's UK introduction, Ford announced the completion of the two millionth Ford Escort, a milestone hitherto unmatched by any Ford model outside the US. It was also stated that 60% of the two million Escorts had been built in Britain. In West Germany cars were built at a slower rate of around 150,000 cars per year, slumping to 78,604 in 1974 which was the last year for the Escort Mark I. Many of the German built Escorts were exported, notably to Benelux and Italy; from the West German domestic market perspective the car was cramped and uncomfortable when compared with the well-established and comparably priced Opel Kadett, and it was technically primitive when set against the successful imported Fiat 128 and Renault 12. Subsequent generations of the Escort made up some of the ground foregone by the original model, but in Europe's largest auto-market the Escort sales volumes always came in well behind those of the General Motors Kadett and its Astra successor.\n\nInitially, the Escort was sold as a two-door saloon (with circular front headlights and rubber flooring on the \"De Luxe\" model). The \"Super\" model featured rectangular headlights, carpets, a cigar lighter and a water temperature gauge. A two-door estate was introduced at the end of March 1968 which, with the back seat folded down, provided a 40% increase in maximum load space over the old Anglia 105E estate, according to the manufacturer. The estate featured the same engine options as the saloon, but it also included a larger, clutch, stiffer rear springs and in most configurations slightly larger brake drums or discs than the saloon. A panel van appeared in April 1968 and the 4-door saloon (a bodystyle the Anglia was never available in for UK market) in 1969.\n\nUnderneath the bonnet was the Kent Crossflow engine also used in the smallest capacity North American Ford Pinto. Diesel engines on small family cars were rare, and the Escort was no exception, initially featuring only petrol engines – in 1.1 L, and 1.3 L versions. A 940 cc engine was also available in some export markets such as Italy and France. This tiny engine remained popular in Italy, where it was carried over for the Escort Mark II, but in France it was discontinued during 1972.\n\nThere was a 1300GT performance version, with a tuned 1.3 L Crossflow (OHV) engine with a Weber carburetor and uprated suspension. This version featured additional instrumentation with a tachometer, battery charge indicator, and oil pressure gauge. The same tuned 1.3 L engine was also used in a variation sold as the Escort Sport, that used the flared front wings from the AVO range of cars, but featured trim from the more basic models. Later, an \"executive\" version of the Escort was produced known as the \"1300E\". This featured the same 13\" road wheels and flared wings of the Sport, but was trimmed in an upmarket, for that time, fashion with wood trim on the dashboard and door cappings.\n\nA higher performance version for rallies and racing was available, the Escort Twin Cam, built for Group 2 international rallying. It had an engine with a Lotus-made eight-valve twin camshaft head fitted to the 1.5 L non-crossflow block, which had a bigger bore than usual to give a capacity of 1,558 cc. This engine had originally been developed for the Lotus Elan. Production of the Twin Cam, which was originally produced at Halewood, was phased out as the Cosworth-engined RS1600 (RS denoting \"Rallye Sport\") production began. The most famous edition of the Twin Cam was raced on behalf of Ford by Alan Mann Racing in the British Saloon Car Championship in 1968 and 1969, sporting a full Formula 2 Ford FVC 16-valve engine producing over 200 hp. The Escort, driven by Australian driver Frank Gardner went on to comfortably win the 1968 championship.\n\nThe Mark I Escorts became successful as a rally car, and they eventually went on to become one of the most successful rally cars of all time. The Ford works team was practically unbeatable in the late 1960s / early 1970s, and arguably the Escort's greatest victory was in the 1970 London to Mexico World Cup Rally, driven by Finnish legend Hannu Mikkola and Swedish co-driver Gunnar Palm. This gave rise to the Escort Mexico (1598cc \"crossflow\"-engined) special edition road versions in honour of the rally car. Introduced in November 1970, 10,352 Mexico Mark Is were built using bodyshells using additional strengthening panels in high stress areas making them more suitable for competition.\n\nIn addition to the Mexico, the RS1600 was developed with a 1,601 cc Cosworth BDA which used a Crossflow block with a 16-valve Cosworth cylinder head, named for \"Belt Drive \"A\" Series\". Both the Mexico and RS1600 were built at Ford's Advanced Vehicle Operations (AVO) facility located at the Aveley Plant in South Essex. As well as higher performance engines and sports suspension, like the Mexico these models featured the strengthened bodyshell.\n\nFord also produced an RS2000 model as an alternative to the somewhat temperamental RS1600, featuring a 2.0 L Pinto (OHC) engine. This also clocked up some rally and racing victories; and pre-empted the hot hatch market as a desirable but affordable performance road car. Like the Mexico and RS1600, this car was produced at the Aveley plant using the strengthened bodyshell.\n\nThe Escort was built in Germany and Britain, as well as in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nModel Range\n\nAll models 1100 and 1300 were offered in 2 door Saloon, 4 door Saloon and 3 doors Estate versions.\n\nFord New Zealand's Seaview plant in Lower Hutt built 1.1 and 1.3-litre versions, initially as Deluxe (1.1) and Super (1.3) two-door sedans plus panel vans. The four-door sedan was added in 1970. Trim levels were revised after the 1972 UK facelift with just one run of 1.3XLs (with the GT instrument pack) before these were downgraded to 'L' trim. Base and L trims were offered to the end of the Mk I run. Some 1.6 Mexicos were imported in 1973–74 after the government temporarily freed up import licensing owing to a shortage of new cars. Estate versions were mostly imported.\n\nThe Mk I was produced by Ford Australia from 1970 to 1975 as a two- or four-door saloon and as a two-door panel van. 1100 cc and 1300 cc engines were offered, as was the 1558 cc twin cam unit., the last only in the Escort Twin Cam model, which was renamed the Escort GT 1600 in late 1971. Some 67,146 examples of the Mk I were built in Australia, with local sourcing bringing the Australian content of the vehicles to 85 per cent.\n\nAssembly of the Mk I Escort was undertaken by Automotive Industries in Upper Nazareth, in conjunction with the local distributor, Israeli Automotive Corp. Assembly from UK-sourced kits started in April 1968. The last Mk I, a light green 1100cc two-door, was produced on 14 November 1975. A total of 14,905 units were assembled in Israel, including 105 Escort 400 vans.\n\nThe Mk I Escort was sold in Japan, imported from the United Kingdom by Kintetsu Motors and was available with the 1.3 L engine in GT trim, and was sold alongside the Ford Cortina and the Ford Capri. Sales were helped by the fact that this generation Escort complied with Japanese government dimension regulations concerning vehicle dimensions and engine displacement. Only the four-door saloon was offered, and this was the only generation available to Japanese buyers. The engine displacement contributed to a lower annual road tax obligation to Japanese buyers which helped sales.\nThe squarer-styled Mark II version appeared in January 1975. The first production models had rolled off the production lines on 2 December 1974.\n\nUnlike the first Escort (which was developed by Ford of Britain), the second generation was developed jointly between the UK and Ford of Germany. Codenamed \"Brenda\" during its development, it used the same mechanical components as the Mark I. The 940 cc engine was still offered in Italy where the smaller engine attracted tax advantages, but in the other larger European markets in Europe it was unavailable. The estate and van versions used the same panelwork as the Mark I, but with the Mark II front end and interior. The car used a revised underbody, which had been introduced as a running change during the last six months production of the Mark I. Rear suspension still sat on leaf springs though some contemporaries such as the Hillman Avenger had moved on to coil springs. The car came in for criticism for its lack of oddments space, with a glove compartment available on only higher end models, and its stalk-mounted horn.\n\nThe \"L\" and \"GL\" models (2-door, 4-door, estate) were in the mainstream private sector, the \"Sport\", \"RS Mexico\", and \"RS2000\" in the performance market, the \"Ghia\" (2-door, 4-door) for a hitherto untapped small car luxury market, and \"base / Popular\" models for the bottom end. Panel-van versions catered to the commercial sector. The 1.6 L (1598 cc/97 CID) engine in the 1975 1.6 Ghia produced 84 hp (63 kW) with 125 N·m (92 ft·lbf) torque and weighed 955 kg (2105 lb).\n\nA cosmetic update was given in 1978 (note that Australia received differing updates - see below), with L models gaining the square headlights (previously exclusive to the GL and Ghia variants) and there was an upgrade in interior and exterior specification for some models. Underneath a wider front track was given.\n\nIn 1979 and 1980 three special edition Escorts were launched: the Linnet, Harrier and Goldcrest.\n\nProduction ended in Britain in August 1980, other countries following soon after.\n\nThe Mk II Escort was assembled at Ford Australia's Homebush Plant, Sydney from March 1975 to 1980 in 2-door and 4-door sedan, and 2-door panel van forms – the estate versions were unavailable to the Australian market.\n\nThe sedan models were available in L, XL (later renamed GL) and Ghia forms, and a Sport pack option – similar to the 1300 and 1600 Sport models sold elsewhere. Unlike other markets – likely due to the estate's absence – the van was offered in a higher level of trim – a GL, and a Sport pack van was also available. Unusual fitments for the range not offered elsewhere on the Australian Escort included 'dog-dish' steel hubcaps, and high-backed front seats.\nThe initial powerplants utilized in the Australian Escorts were Ford's 1.3 L and 1.6 L OHV Crossflow units, offered with either 4-speed manual or 3-speed automatic transmissions. In 1977, to cope with Australian emission laws, in particular ADR27A, the 1.3L models were dropped and the Ford Cortina's 2.0L OHC Pinto engine (in a lower tune to European units) was introduced to the Escort range, available as an option on nearly all models. Codenamed internally by Ford Australia as \"BC\", the Australian Escort range's bodies were modified to fit the larger engine and a redesigned fuel-tank, which involved the placement of the fuel filler being behind the rear numberplate.\n\nIn 1978, Ford Australia standardised the use of the blue oval logo across the Escort model range. These Escort models are identified by the familiar blue Ford oval in the centre of the grille and on the right of the bootlid. It also revamped the image of its 'leisure range' by introducing the Escort Sundowner panel van, positioning it as a youth-orientated lifestyle vehicle complete with bold body decorations and domed side windows, available in 1.6L and 2.0L forms. In 1979, Ford Australia gave the Escort an update, increasing basic equipment levels and standardising square headlights on L and GL models (previously only available on Escort Ghia). Chasing both youth and performance, Ford Australia introduced their take on the RS2000, which – complete with its slant-nose – was available in both two-door form and as a unique to Australia four-door, in a choice of five solid paint colours. These RS cars certainly looked the part, but were actually powered by the same 2.0-litre engine as the rest of the local Escort range, and available with a choice of manual or automatic transmission. A total of 2,400 Australian RS2000 cars were made.\n\nWhile offered in many model forms, the Escort, like the Cortina, was not popular on the Australian market, largely due to expanding competition from Japanese imports and the established preference of Australian drivers for larger six-cylinder vehicles.\n\nAustralian Escort production ceased in late 1980, with 79,142 examples of the Mk II produced, the range being replaced by FWD derivatives of the Mazda 323/Familia, namely the Ford Laser 3-door and 5-door hatchback and the Meteor 4-door sedan.\n\nThe Mk II Escort was introduced to New Zealand in early 1975, assembled at Ford's plant in Wiri, South Auckland. Unlike the Australian models, the New Zealand Escort range followed the specifications of the British models, aside from the use of metric instrumentation. All bodystyles were assembled, including the estate – previously (in Mk I guise) a built-up import from the United Kingdom.\n\nA large choice of models were available in the NZ Escort range, consisting of 1.1 L (base), 1.3 L (L, GL, 1300 Sport, estate and van variants) and 1.6 L (Ghia, 1600 Sport) variants — the 1.1 being aimed at budget conscious buyers, the 1.3 L models were popular, and the 1.6 L – which appeared in New Zealand production in 1976 – being reserved for 1600 Sport and Ghia models. A three-speed automatic transmission was available as an option for most 1.3- and 1.6-litre models.\n\nUnlike Australia, the Escort and Cortina ranges sold well and often topped the car monthly sales lists. An update was given for the range for 1979, which notably involved the addition of the Ghia model, the adoption of the GL's square headlights on the lower end models, Ford blue oval badging, and sport wheels on the L and GL. For 1980, all Ghia models gained standard alloy wheels.\n\nThe production of British-sourced and New Zealand-assembled Escorts ended in late 1980. Ford dealers offered large price reductions to shift their remaining Mk II Escort stock when the model was replaced in New Zealand by the Ford Laser in May 1981, which was a badge engineered Mazda 323, available in sedan and hatchback forms.\n\nURUGUAY, CUARÓ STREET, MONTEVIDEO. from 1977 to 1981, SPORT 1600 version in 2 and 4 doors. Ghia 1.6 4 doors 1978 - 1980. Very popular in this country.\nAssembly of the Mk II Escort commenced in August 1975. The Escort was a best-seller in the Israeli market, its best year being 1976, when a total of 3,801 units were assembled. The line-up included 1.1- and 1.3-litre versions. Most were of the four-door variety, and only 150 were built as a 2-door 1.1L. Assembly ended after 12,700 units, in April 1981. No Ford passenger car was since then assembled in Israel.\n\nEscort Mark II shells built in Halewood, England were assembled in Silverton, South Africa from late 1975 until 1980. When originally launched, the Escort Mark II was sold as the 1300 L or as the 1600 GL, with two- or four-door bodywork. Aside from colour-coded hubcaps, most of the equipment differences were only on the inside with the GL being considerably better equipped. The GL also received square headlights, back-up lights, and body-side mouldings. The South African Escort received the 1.3-litre Kent engine with , while the 1.6 claimed . Early in 1979 the 1600 sport was launched, featuring a two-door bodyshell, revised gear ratios and a sporty look, using the 1600 motor proving to become a highly popular vehicle to the present day. The \"One Six Double O\" Sport was the best selling car in South Africa in 1980 at its retail price of R4995.00. These vehicles had a stronger Kent block cast in South Africa that had thicker cylinder walls, which was and is still utilised in the Formula Ford series. SA vehicles differed in minor ways from European built counterparts in that the interior exposed metal parts were painted Matt black as opposed to body colour and the bonnet/hood prop pivoted from the right as opposed to the left.\n\nAs with its predecessor, the Mark II had a successful rallying career. All models of the Mark I were carried over to the Mark II, though the Mexico gained the RS badge and had its engine changed to a OHC Pinto instead of the OHV. A \"Sport\" model was also produced using the 1.6 L Crossflow. A new model was released, the RS1800, which had a naturally aspirated Cosworth BDE DOHC 4 valves per cylinder with a 32/36 DGAV Weber carburetor inline-four engine, producing at 6000 rpm and of torque at 3750 rpm. It was essentially a special created for rallying.\n\nThe works rally cars were highly specialised machines. Bodyshells were heavily strengthened and characterised by the wide wheelarch extensions, and fitment of four large spotlights for night stages. The Cosworth BDE engine was replaced with 2.0 L BDG and gave up to with Cosworth-made aluminium block by 1979. It was complemented by a strengthened transmission, five-speed straight-cut ZF gearbox, five-linked suspension and more minor modifications.\n\nThe Mark II Escort continued its predecessor's run on the RAC Rally, winning every year from 1975 to 1979 and racing in a variety of other events around the world. In the 1979 season of the World Rally Championship, Björn Waldegård took the drivers' title, Hannu Mikkola was runner-up and Ari Vatanen finished the year in fifth place, all driving Escort RS1800s.\n\nThese drivers' successes throughout the year gave Ford the manufacturers' title, the only time the company had achieved this until the 2006 season, when Marcus Grönholm and Mikko Hirvonen won the title for Ford in Ford Focus RS WRC 06. Vatanen won the drivers' title in 1981, again at the wheel of an RS1800. This victory came despite the arrival on the WRC scene of the four-wheel drive Audi Quattro. Ford placed in the top three in the manufacturers' championship for the sixth year in a row.\n\nThe 2.0 L RS2000 version, with its distinctively slanted polyurethane nose, and featuring the Pinto engine from the Cortina, was announced in the UK in March 1975 and introduced in Germany in August 1975, being reportedly produced in both countries. It provided a claimed 110 bhp and a top speed of 110 mph (177 km/h). For acceleration to 100 km/h (62.5 mph) a time of just 8.9 seconds was claimed by the manufacturers. The 2.0 L engine was also easily retro-fitted into the Mark I, along with the Ford Sierra's five-speed gearbox, for rallying and other sports.\n\nCodenamed \"Erika\", the third generation Escort was launched in September 1980. The car, Ford Europe's second front-wheel drive model, was originally meant to be called the \"Ford Erika\", but ended up retaining the Escort name. Some say this was due to British consumers' reluctance to let go of the \"Escort\" badge (as the first two generations of Escort had been among Britain's most popular cars, with the Mk II being Britain's best selling car in 1976), and some say that the Germans were concerned with the song Erika, which was a famous battlemarch of the German armed forces during World War II. The North American Escort introduced at this time was a distantly related derivative. Sales in the United Kingdom increased, and by 1982 it had overtaken the ageing Cortina as the nation's best-selling car, beginning an eight-year run as Britain's best selling car. Unlike the Mark II, which had essentially been a reskin of the original 1968 platform, the Mark III was a completely new \"wheels-up\" design, and was conceived as a hi-tech, high-efficiency vehicle which would compete with the Volkswagen Golf and Honda Civic – considered at the time the class benchmarks, and indeed the car was launched with the advertising tagline \"\"Simple is Efficient\"\". The Mark III was a departure from the two previous models, the biggest changes being the adoption of front-wheel drive, and the new hatchback body. It was Ford Europe's second front-wheel drive model launch, the first being the smaller Fiesta in 1976, while the hatchback bodystyle had debuted in the company's range in 1974 on the second generation Capri.\n\nThe car used Ford's contemporary design language of the period with the black louvred radiator grille and straked rear lamp clusters, as well as introducing the aerodynamic \"bustle-back\" bootlid stump (trademarked by Ford as \"Aeroback\") which would be further developed in the forthcoming Sierra and Scorpio; the stump was proven to reduce the car's aerodynamic drag co-efficient significantly, which was a class leading 0.37 at launch.\n\nAlso new were the overhead camshaft CVH engines in 1.3 L and 1.6 L formats, with the older Ford Kent-based \"Valencia\" engine from the Fiesta powering the 1.1 L derivative, although there was a short-lived 1.1 version of the CVH engine sold in certain markets before it was discontinued in 1982. The suspension was fully independent all around, departing from the archaic leaf spring arrangement found on its predecessors. The Escort Mark III was voted European Car of the Year in 1981, fighting off stiff competition from Italy's Fiat Panda and British Leyland's Austin Metro.\n\nFrom launch, the car was available in base (Popular), L, GL, Ghia and XR3 trim. From mid-1982, a five-speed manual gearbox was introduced across the range. This was now standard on the 1.6 L versions and could be specified as an option on most 1.3 L engines. A selection of features was available, either as standard fitment or optional extras depending on model, including a tilt-and-slide sunroof, central locking, and electric windows. All models except for base and L were fitted with a check-light system for low fuel, low oil, low coolant, low screenwash, and worn out brake pads. Power steering was not available on European Escorts although it was available on the US Escort. For the 1983 model year, the Ford ATX three-speed automatic transmission (developed primarily for the US version) was available on the 1.6 L engine within a couple of years of the car's launch.\n\nHowever, the car attracted criticism from the motoring press at launch due to its suspension, with positive camber on the front wheels and negative camber at the rear, giving rise to the Mark III's infamous \"knock-kneed\" stance. The Mark III soon had a reputation for a harsh, unforgiving ride. In 1983 the revised suspension mounts from the Escort-based Orion and the larger Sierra steering rack were introduced as running changes for the 1984 model year which also coincided with a minor update for it including a new Escort badge at the rear.\n\nAnother engine, introduced in August 1983, was the 1.6 L diesel engine. Developed in Dagenham, it was remarkably economical for its time, and still is to this day, managing over 70 mpg. It was available on the L and GL models. However, the performance was not so impressive, with only and a top speed of barely .\n\nThe Escort estate was initially only available with three doors, but a five-door version was introduced in 1983. In that year, a saloon version of the Escort, the Orion, was launched. It used the same mechanicals as the hatchback, but had a more upmarket image and was not available with the smaller 1.1 L engine. It was also directed at buyers of the earlier Cortina, which had ceased production in 1982, with its Sierra successor not available as a saloon at the time.\n\nThe Mk III model (1980–1986), was the most common type of car on British roads in December 1989, with almost 1,500,000 examples registered.\n\nA convertible version, made by coachbuilder Karmann appeared the same year as the five-door estate (1983). It was the first drop-top car produced by Ford Europe since the Corsair of the 1960s. The Escort Cabriolet was initially available in both XR3i and Ghia specification, but the Ghia variant was later dropped.\n\nTo compete with Volkswagen's Golf GTI, a hot hatch version of the Mark III was developed – the XR3. Initially this featured a tuned version of the 1.6 L CVH engine fitted with a twin-choke Weber carburettor, uprated suspension and numerous cosmetic alterations. It lacked a five-speed transmission and fuel injection. Fuel injection finally arrived in October 1982 (creating the XR3i), eight months behind the limited edition (8,659 examples), racetrack-influenced RS 1600i. The Cologne-developed RS received a more powerful engine with , thanks to computerized ignition and a modified head as well as the fuel injection.\n\nThe final performance update arrived in the form of the turbocharged RS Turbo model in October 1984. The RS Turbo was somewhat of a disappointment; it had been delayed several times and when it went on sale in early 1985 the chassis came in for severe criticism. The RS Turbo Series 1 was only marketed in a few European nations as production was limited to 5,000 examples, all in white. They were well equipped, with the alloy wheels from the limited production RS 1600i, Recaro seats, and a limited slip differential. One car only was finished in black; it was built especially for Lady Diana. The Series 2 RS Turbo continued with the 1986 MKIV model.\n\nThe Ford Escort RS 1700T was a prototype RWD car designed by Ford Motor Company in 1980 to compete in Group B rallying. Prototypes were based on the Mk III Escort and featured a Cosworth developed 1.8-litre turbocharged four-cylinder engine that produced over maximum power. Also a prototype with a 2.4 litre Hart engine (derived from a Formula Two unit) was tested in 1982.\n\nPersistent problems during the vehicle's development prompted Ford to drop plans for its production and instead begin work on an all-wheel-drive model to beat the Audi Quattro, designed and built from scratch, resulting in the famous RS200.\n\nThe two-door Escort Van was first sold in February 1981, a slightly delayed introduction caused by large remaining stocks of the Mark II Escort Van. The Van has twin rear doors and unusual small side windows behind the front doors, necessary to provide more over-the-shoulder visibility which would otherwise be limited by the use of the short front doors from the five-door Escort. Derived from the van was a pickup version of the Escort, the Bantam, which was produced in South Africa.\n\nThe Escort entered production in Brazil in July 1983, with either three or five doors. To better deal with the tropical heat, the Brazilian three-door Escort received swing-out rear windows, unlike their European counterparts. It was equipped with the Renault-based Ford CHT engine, of either 1341 or 1555 cc. Both size engines were also available in alcohol-fuelled versions with marginally more power. It was originally available in base (Popular), LX or GLX trim levels, with four- or five-speed manual transmissions. In October 1983 the luxurious Ghia version was added.\n\nThis model was exported to Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway from 1983 until 1986, where it replaced the low priced German-built Escort L. The car had a bad reputation in Scandinavia, with severe rust problems and issues with the wet liners of the Renault-designed engine. The engines were also designed to run on petrol containing some ethanol (15-20%), leading to troubles when using straight petrol. The Brazilian Escort LX was also available in Switzerland, only with the larger engine option.\n\nBrazil also received an XR3 version towards the very end of 1983, only available with a tuned version of the 1.6-liter engine running on alcohol. Aside from interior and exterior enhancements including spoilers and 14-inch alloy wheels, the XR3's engine produced , a bit more than the regular versions but not quite enough to be considered a sporting car. In April 1985, the Escort Cabriolet was introduced. It was built in Brazil in collaboration between Ford and Karmann, with the top imported from Germany.\n\nThe Escort was also available in South Africa, as hatchback only, from March 1981, with the 1.3 and 1.6 litre engines. The South African Escorts differ only slightly from European ones, as a result of local parts content regulations. The XR3 was also sold, known simply as the Ford XR3 and later XR3i, rather than the Ford Escort XR3.\n\nThe fourth version of the Ford Escort was launched in March 1986, with only a small number of changes. Although popularly regarded as a fourth generation model (and is popularly known as the \"Mark IV\"), internally within Ford it was regarded as a Mark III facelift and consequently carried the codename 'Erika-86'. It was instantly recognisable as an updated version of the previous model, taking styling cues from the recently introduced Scorpio/Granada III - with a smooth style nose and the \"straked\" rear lamp clusters smoothed over, internally the car had a completely new dashboard and other smaller changes. Optional new features included a mechanical anti‐lock braking system (standard on RS Turbo models), a fuel computer on fuel-injected models, and a heated windscreen. However, the check-light system for low fuel, low oil, low coolant, low screenwash, and worn out brake pads was no longer fitted to any model. Air conditioning was not available on cars sold in Europe although it was an option on cars sold in Argentina and Brazil.\n\nThese changes were welcome at a time when the Escort was faced with a host of new competitors; General Motors had brought out a new version of the Opel Kadett/Vauxhall Astra 18 months earlier, shortly after Volkswagen had introduced the Mk II Golf and British Leyland had launched the Austin Maestro, while the British-built Peugeot 309 had gone on sale just weeks before the updated Escort. All-new competitors from Fiat and Renault were just two years away.\n\nIn 1987, an LX trim designation was introduced, situated between the L and GL models. As well as an all-new interior, a new 1.4 L derivative of the CVH engine was introduced, as well as numerous suspension tweaks to address the long-standing criticisms of the Escort's handling and ride quality, although these had limited success.\n\nIn 1988, the diesel engine was enlarged to 1.8 L. Also for the 1989 model year, the entry level 1.1 L and 1.3 L models were updated with the redesigned HCS version of the Kent/Valencia family developed for the Mk III Fiesta. For the same year, a Ford developed electronic fuel injection system replaced the Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection system in the XR3i and Orion Ghia injection models, and a central point fuel injection system replaced the carburettor on models with the 1.4 L engine.\n\nFord gave the Escort‐based Orion saloon a similar makeover. Carried over from the previous range was the 3-speed automatic which was ultimately replaced late in the production run with a variant of the CTX stepless gearbox as first used in the Fiesta a couple of years earlier. A luxurious Orion 1600E with leather seats, fuel injection, alloy wheels, and a Ghia trim was produced during 1989 and 1990. A total of 1,600 were made, with 1,000 of these having leather trim. The Orion range was also broadened to include a more basic \"L\" trim for the first time.\n\nA minor update occurred in Spring 1989 where the Escort badge at the rear changed to look more modern as well as some minor trim revisions in order to maintain interest in the car until the Mark V arrived the following year.\n\nEscorts for European markets continued to be assembled at Halewood, near Liverpool, and at the West German factory of Saarlouis. Sales were strong through the decade, and during the later 1980s Escort production also commenced at the Ford plant originally established for Fiesta production in Valencia. European production finished in 1990, although stocks of the model, especially the XR3i and RS Turbo variants continued into 1991 and finished in 1992.\n\nAt this time, the Escort was dropped in South Africa and replaced by the Mazda-derived Laser and Meteor. However, the Escort‐based Bantam pick-up remained in production, facelifted, and was also sold as a Mazda Rustler.\n\nBrazilian Escorts were introduced only shortly after the European originals, in August 1983. At first, only the CHT 1.6-liter engine was available, running on alcohol or petrol and in a more powerful XR3 version only running on alcohol. Power was up marginally over the previous generation. As of May 1989, the 1.8 L AP engine made by Volkswagen became available. This was part of the AutoLatina agreement, where Ford CHT engines were used in Volkswagen cars and vice versa. The 1.0 L and 1.6 L were all Ford CHT motors. All Escorts made after 1993 were fuel-injected, excepting the Hobby models. Additionally, the Mark IV model was made until 1992 on all versions, except the Hobby which was made until 1996.\n\nThis generation was only built with three doors in Brazil, although the five-door model was produced in Argentina. The advent of Mercosur opened the door for trade with Brazil's neighbours. In late 1991, for the 1992 model year, the Argentinian-made five-door became available in Brazil under the name \"Escort Guarujá\" (named after a town in the state of São Paulo). This was only available with a catalyzed version of the 1.8-liter \"AP\" engine and a high standard of equipment, including the Ghia's body-coloured rear spoiler and distinct, eight-hole alloy wheels. The Guarujá was the first catalyzed car to be built in Argentina, although it was not available in its home market. It sold well initially, leading all other imports in January 1992. However, Argentinian products had a low reputation in Brazil at the time and the Guarujá only remained on the market for about a year. The more powerful Volkswagen engine finally allowed the XR3, now with , to live up to the promises made by its appearance. In 1990, the XR3 gained body-colored skirts and wings.\n\nArgentinian production had begun in 1988 with many parts imported from Brazil, although the five-door model was available there from the beginning and the engine options differed. The original versions were the GL and Ghia, both fitted with the 1.6-liter CHT; these were then replaced by the Volkswagen-made AP 1.6 (not used in Brazilian Escorts) in the Escort 1.6 LX and Ghia SX after a little over a year. There was also the 1.8-liter Ghia S - close in spec to the Guarujá export version, and with available air conditioning - and the sporty XR3. The convertible was available, shipped in fully built from Brazil. The fourth generation Escort remained in production in Argentina until 1994.\n\nIn 1993, the Escort Hobby trim was introduced in Brazil, using a 1.0 L engine. This was a small-bore version derived from the CHT 1.3 L used in the Brazilian Mk III. This engine was unique to Brazil, whereas the 1.1 L engine was smallest available in most markets. The 1.0 was less powerful, but fuel efficient. Brazil has a special tax break for cars with engines of less than one litre, making this a closely contested segment. The Hobby did not receive Escort badging.\n\nThere were no trims with a high-power engine in Brazil. The most powerful Escort was the 1991 Escort XR3 Formula which had . The on-board computer was not available in Brazil.\nThe Escort Mark V platform (and Mark III Orion saloon) arrived in September 1990 with an all-new bodyshell and a simplified torsion beam rear suspension (instead of the Mark III's fully independent layout). Initially the 1.3 L HCS, 1.4 L and 1.6 L CVH petrol and 1.8 L diesel units were carried over from the old model. This model however was poorly received by the motoring press, and was panned by journalists for its mediocre driving dynamics and unremarkable styling. The engines which had been carried over from the previous generation largely unmodified were also heavily criticised for their poor refinement.\n\nIn early 1992, an all new Zetec 16-valve engine was launched bringing improved driveability, while also marking the return of the XR3i which was available with two versions of the 1.8 L Zetec engine. The 150 PS (110 kW) RS2000 also appeared in the autumn of 1991 with a 16v version of the Sierra's I4 2.0 L engine and also improved ride and handling meaning that this version of the Escort finally delivered on the road. Specifications, however, were also higher than before. The Escort was now available with items such as power steering, electric windows, central locking, electronic antilock brakes, and air conditioning. Some of these options were even available on some of the entry-level models.\n\nThe fifth generation Escort was launched in South America in December 1992, being manufactured in Brazil and Argentina by AutoLatina, a joint-venture between Volkswagen and Ford. A result of this collaboration was that these Escorts were equipped with a VW AP engine in the top 1.8 and 2.0 L versions, now fitted with catalytic converters. The top of the line was the Escort XR3i, equipped with a multipoint fuel injected version of the VW AP 2.0 L engine generating 115 PS (85 kW). The entry-level Escorts received the old Renault-derived 1.6-liter CHT engine with , while the earlier Mark IV continued to be available as the Escort Hobby, with a 1.0 or 1.6-liter engine.\n\nThree- and five-door hatchbacks were available, as was a two-door convertible. In October 1993 the Verona appeared, a rebadged Orion/Escort saloon. The Verona was not available in Argentina. This generation also spawned two VW-branded cars with the same mechanics (but different body styles and interiors) called Volkswagen Pointer (five-door hatchback) and Logus (a two-door saloon).\n\nIn 1996, just before being redesigned to match the European Mark VI, Brazilian production came to a halt and Argentina became the sole Escort manufacturer in South America. The cars were exported to Brazil and elsewhere. The facelifted Mark V was never built in South America.\n\nEarly 1992 saw the launch of the Escort RS Cosworth. Intended to replace the Sierra Sapphire RS Cosworth (which finished production shortly afterwards) as Ford's stalwart rally challenger as well as a competitor to supercars with private buyers, it used the turbocharged 2.0 L Cosworth 16-valve engine, generated some 227 PS (167 kW) and was capable of 150 mph. As well as having four-wheel drive, its most memorable feature was its extremely large \"whale-tail\" tailgate spoiler.\n\nThe 2,500 road-going examples sold (required for homologation purposes) were made, but demand for the car was so high that Ford kept producing them. Later models (1995 up) have a smaller turbo than the homologation versions and came with the whale-tail spoiler as an option. The Escort Cosworth ceased production in 1996, but it has already achieved classic status and has a huge following. However, the car wasn't mechanically an Escort, being based on the four-wheel drive Sierra floorpan and mechanicals, including its longitudinally mounted engine, and was merely clothed in body panels to resemble a Mark V.\n\n\nStung by the criticism of the original Mark V (which was still hugely popular despite motoring press criticism of its styling, ride and handling), Ford facelifted the Escort and Orion in September 1992, giving the revised cars a new grille, bonnet and, in the Escort convertible and hatchback's case, a new rear end. A new 1.6 L 16-valve 90 bhp (66 kW) Zetec engine was introduced, replacing the previous CVH. Fuel injection was now standard on all petrol models, and Ford introduced a four-wheel-drive variant of the RS2000, offering much improved handling over its front-wheel-drive cousins. A first for the Escort also saw the introduction of all disc brakes on all four wheels as standard on all RS2000 and XR3i models.\n\nAlso new for 1993 were 1.3 L and 1.4 L CFi petrol engines and 1.8 L diesel engines.\n\nIn September 1993, the Orion name was retired, with the saloon taking on the Escort badge. The XR3i was discontinued several months later, at the beginning of 1994.\n\nThe crash structure of the Escort and Orion was also improved for 1993 as part of the facelift, featuring side impact bars, a reinforced safety cage, improved crumple zones and front seat-belt pretensioners and for 1994 airbags were added to the Escort range. This Escort was the first European Ford after the Mondeo to feature an airbag; shortly afterwards a driver's airbag became standard across the whole Ford range, with many other models having a passenger airbag as at least optional equipment. Production ended in 1995, although stocks including the Escort, Escort L, Ghia and Si continued through 1996 and finished in 1997.\n\nThe Ford Escort was revised in January 1995, although it was still based on the previous model. This version had new front lights, bonnet, front wings, front and rear bumpers, wing mirrors, door handles and 4 different front radiator grilles (slats, honeycomb, circles and chrome). At the rear, the Ford logo moved from the right to the centre of the boot, except for the van and some convertible models. The interior of the car was hugely revised too following heavy criticism of the original 1990 car which featured low quality plastics for its interior mouldings - the car now featured an all new dashboard arrangement of competitive quality. However, the underlying car was now five years old and most of its rivals were either new or to be imminently replaced.\n\nThe two entry level engines were revised – the 1.3 L received the latest version of the Kent/Valencia family – the Endura-E from the recently launched Mk IV Fiesta and Ka, whilst the 1.4L CVH was replaced by the updated CVH-PTE unit. There were no changes to either the venerable 1.8 diesel or the 1.6/1.8 Zetec units at the top end of the range. The improved iB5 version of the venerable BC-series transmission was also later introduced as a running change.\n\nDynamically, the handling and ride were also much improved with revised suspension set up from that on the previous Mark V models. The sporty \"Si\" model had slightly stiffer suspension than the Encore, LX and Ghia variants, although the Si was otherwise the same as the LX with some additional standard, mainly cosmetic, enhancements such as front and rear spoilers (which were also available as options on the LX), sports seats and white-faced dashboard instruments. Some special trim levels of the Escort include: Calypso Cabriolet, Freedom, Serenade, and Mexico.\n\nThe RS2000 models ceased production in June 1996, and were the last Escorts ever to wear the famous RS badge. The RS badge did not resurface until the Focus RS arrived in 2002. A new Ghia X model was introduced around 1996, which included air conditioning and a 6 CD autochanger as standard. Although the equipment of the Ghia below it was reduced, it was now more affordable.\n\nThe last \"standard\" model to be introduced in 1997 was the GTi — the only GTi-badged Ford to ever be sold in Europe. This used the same existing 115 PS (85 kW) 1.8 L Zetec-E engine found in other cars in the range, but included a body kit borrowed from the now cancelled RS2000 model, part-leather seats plus the standard fitment of ABS. The GTi was available in 3- and 5-door hatchback and estate bodystyles.\n\nIn Chile, to avoid confusion with the US-market Escort which was being sold alongside it, this generation was sold as the \"EuroEscort\" for several years.\n\nIn 1998, Ford announced an all-new car, the Focus, which replaced the Escort and superseded the \"Escort\" name that had been in use for 30 years. The Escort range was cut down to just \"Flight\" and \"Finesse\" editions, and sold for a further two years in parallel with the Focus. All engines except the 1.6 L petrol and 1.8 L turbo diesel were dropped, as were the three-door hatchback, four-door saloon and cabriolet bodystyles (except in mainland Europe, New Zealand, South Africa and South America).\n\nThe Flight cost £10,380 and offered electric front windows, a three-speed fan and a cassette player. For an additional £1,000 the Finesse added alloy wheels, air conditioning, a CD player, fog lamps and metallic paint. The more competitive prices managed to keep European Escort sales going until the last one rolled off the Halewood assembly line in July 2000, although remaining stocks were sold into 2001, making it the last Ford car to be assembled there. The plant was transferred to Jaguar that year for the new X-Type saloon, and following the later merger with Land Rover and the sale of the plant to Tata, Ford now only has a small presence at Halewood - retaining the transmission works at the site.\n\nThe van variant remained in production in a facility located behind the now Jaguar plant at Halewood until 2002 when the new Transit Connect model was introduced. The Escort hatchback and estate were produced in Argentina until 2004, having been sold alongside its successor (the Focus) during the final stages of production. Escort-based light vans had been offered since 1968, although the market sector, always larger in the UK than in continental Europe, dated back beyond the 1950s when successive Ford Anglias had been available with a van variant. After the demise of the Escort, Ford would be represented in this niche by the Turkish assembled Ford Transit Connect.\n\nWhile this generation was not sold in Australia at any point, it was however sold in New Zealand imported fully built up from the UK between 1996 and 1998 in all bodystyles including the van, replacing the Ford Laser. The hatch and saloon were discontinued in 1999 due to unfavourable exchange rates - this is also the reason why the Laser was reintroduced, and the Focus was not introduced to the New Zealand market until 2003. The Escort estate and van continued on sale on the local market until 1999 until stock from the UK dried up, the estate having reasonable success due to the lack of a replacement Laser wagon following the end of local production of the outdated 1980s KE Laser wagon in 1996. 1.6 or 1.8-litre petrol and the diesel 1.8 were available.\n\nAs well as being one of the most popular cars in Europe throughout its production life, the Escort was frequently the best selling car in Britain during the 1980s and 1990s. A total of more than 4.1 million Escorts of all generations were sold there over a period of 33 years.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2227751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227751", "title": "Prinny", "text": "Prinny\n\nThe Prinny was created by Takehito Harada while he was trying to come up with a character whose thoughts players could not try to envision. He began by choosing to make it animal-based, eventually deciding on making something similar to a penguin. He was told that he could use this character as much as he wanted. While it initially started out as looking somewhat realistic, it eventually gained a doll-like form.\n\nA prinny is a small, usually blue, pouch-wearing penguin-like creature with disproportionately small bat wings, two peg legs where feet would normally be, and stitches at the top of the chest. When thrown, they explode on impact. A common trait of prinnies is their upbeat attitude and tendency to end their sentences with \"-ssu\". In the English translation, they frequently use \"dood\" as an interjection. Prinnies stand roughly three feet, three inches (100 cm) tall, though the weight can vary. Prinnies attack with knives, bombs, and occasionally other weapons stored in their bags. While rarely mentioned in the game, prinnies have been known to dispense a beverage known as prinny juice, which according to a Nippon Ichi Software America interview is produced from \"the most flavorful and delicious parts of our fresh, vine-grown Prinnies\".\n\nIn \"Disgaea: Hour of Darkness\", humans who have led a worthless life, such as thieves or murderers, or have committed a mortal sin such as suicide, have their souls sewn into the body of a prinny upon their death. Due to the unstable soul of a human, regular prinnies will explode when they hit something with great force, such as when thrown. However, Prinny suits filled with demon souls, as seen in \"Makai Kingdom\" or in the case of recurring boss Baal, will not. After being reborn, the newly created prinny will serve as a soldier, slave, or servant in the Netherworld or Celestia. The prinny remains until it has earned reincarnation by redemption through good deeds or earning enough money, and leaves its servitude in a ritual involving the Red Moon. In Celestia, prinnies mostly act as maids and domestic servants. The good deeds they perform there lead to their reincarnation. In the Netherworld, depending on the lord they serve, they spend their difficult after-lives doing excessively hard labor for very little pay, and are often thrown around just for the amusement of their lords. The pittance of money they earn in the Netherworld goes towards their reincarnation.\n\nSome prinnies live in Prinny Land, their own world in which prinnies do not explode when thrown. Some prinnies flee there to escape their lives in the Netherworld, and some may have rebelled or have been banished there. Another place prinnies can be found is the Land of Carnage. These prinnies live for battle and look down on newcomers. While prinnies manage all shops and such, an old friend can be found here too. Prinny Kurtis makes a comeback as a Land of Carnage only character. The player can summon Kurtis with cell phones and pass some bills from the Earth Defense Forces to aid him, it is not needed to gain access to Kurtis. In the Land of Carnage, the prinnies call warriors who fight hundreds of thousands of battles \"Shura.\" Rumor has it, there is a prinny who has lived in the Land of Carnage longer than anyone else and is the master of the land.\n\nPrinnies have appeared in almost every major Nippon Ichi video game; their first appearance was in the game \"\". Prinnies follow a ranking system, starting at Private Prinny and moving up to Prinny God. The \"Uber Prinny\", which is the prinny form of Baal, cannot be utilized by players. Prinnies are usually under Etna's control. In \"\" they lead the Dark Court and are responsible for judging the party's crimes, of which a guilty verdict will always be passed. In general the felonies applied by the Dark Court are to the player's benefit but if one wants to remove them from a character for various reasons then the character must reincarnate as a Prinny to atone for their sins. Unlike most other incarnations, prinny gods do not have immunity to status effects. In , a special Prinny under the title Hero Prinny appears as part of special downloadable content. The Hero Prinny claims that he has come to make a guest appearance from \"Prinny: Can I Really Be The Hero?\", but Mao doesn't believe him. It ends up that Mao defeats and captures Hero Prinny, and turns him into a hero. The Hero Prinny then becomes playable. Prinnies star in their own game \"\" for the PSP handheld console.\n\nIn \"\", prinnies are said to possess the soul of a demon, rather than that of a human. Their bodies are manufactured in Ruskan factories, located in another dimension, by inventor demons. In order to create Prinny units in \"Makai Kingdom\", the player must first make a wish to create Prinnies in The Sacred Tome. Then the first Prinny class will become available to create. The weaponry available to a prinny is expanded to include expertise with shovels and wrenches. The Prinnies do not explode when thrown. Prinnies appear in \"Phantom Brave\", which does not use a subclass system, and are able to use all weapon types, but have a smaller role in the game's plot. Pringer X serves as the final challenge of the bonus storyline. \"Phantom Brave\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Prinnies cause explosions upon being summoned or unsummoned, these explosions do not injure the Prinny itself. Airborne prinnies make an appearance in \"\", a game similar to \"Pilotwings\", used to add a \"Nippon Ichi flavor\" to the title. The crossover role playing game \"Cross Edge\" features a prinny and Etna. They also appeared in \"Trinity Universe\", a crossover game with characters from Idea Factory, Nippon Ichi, and Gust Corporation. Nippon Ichi's characters include the Prinny as well as Etna and Flonne. A giant Prinny appeared as a special attack in the company-collaborative RPG, Hyperdimension Neptunia Mk2, where the in-game character Nisa (named Nippon Ichi in the Japanese version) throws a bunch of kunais at enemies, then throws the giant Prinny at the enemies, which results in a nuclear bomb type explosion. Nisa is also designed to resemble a Prinny. A Prinny cap is unlockable in the remake of Cave Story, Cave Story 3D, published by Nippon Ichi Software. Prinny also appear in the PS3 Exclusive title Last Rebellion as optional bosses to be faced in the final mirror when entered as Nine. \n\nPrinny appeared in a \"Penny Arcade\" comic strip on September 4, 2006. Prinny also appears as a recurring character in \"Fred Perry's LvlUp!\" comic series.\n\nPrinnies are regarded as mascots for the \"Disgaea\" series, featuring strongly in Nippon Ichi's marketing such as the annual Tipsy Prinny press events. The third event, held in the Zebulon Bar San Francisco on June 5, 2008, featured green Prinnies suspended from every banister and light fitting. Nippon Ichi Software's online store sells various merchandise such as several different Prinny plushies, and in Japan Nippon Ichi has released several pieces of Prinny merchandise and has used the characters in cosplay to promote the release of \"Prinny: Can I Really be the Hero?\" in Akihabara. A Prinny stylus was featured as a pre-order bonus for people who pre-ordered \"\". Additionally four Prinny avatars for the PlayStation 3's PlayStation Home were also released for sale, modeled after the different unique Prinnies in the original \"Disgaea\".\n\nPrinnies have been described as one of the most notable characters in the \"Disgaea\" series. RPGamer called them the \"much-adored penguin mascots\" of \"Disgaea\", while Wired.com called them \"adorably snarky.\" IGN editor Dave McCarthy praised \"\"s humour, citing the Prinnies as an example. In a preview of the upcoming game starting the character in , Chris Hudak asked \"What better sign that you've warmed the cold hearts of videogamers worldwide than to have your own beloved, signature character?\", additionally comparing in great detail the Prinny to fellow video game mascots Mario, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Dragon Quest's Slime. PSX Extreme described them as \"one of the most recognizable – and curiously lovable – characters\" in the \"Disgaea\" series. Webcomic \"Penny Arcade\" featured a Prinny in their comic to mark the release of \"\", adding in the commentary \"You've probably heard that penguins are great fathers or whatever, you saw that Goddamn penguin movie and you bought into their whole thing. When faced with one of these hideous creatures, there is only one recourse: be stern for two panels, and then give in.\" GamesRadar listed the Prinny as one of the 25 best new characters of the decade, describing it as \"heartwarmingly pathetic,\" calling the act of creating an army of \"nigh-invulnerable Prinny wimps\" is one of the greatest accomplishments in role-playing games. They also listed it as one of the most impractical video game characters, describing it as \"incredibly stupid.\"\n"}
{"id": "2227753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227753", "title": "Ford Escort (North America)", "text": "Ford Escort (North America)\n\nThe North American variant of the Ford Escort is a compact/small family car introduced by Ford in 1980 for the 1981 model year. Sharing its name with the third-generation European Ford Escort, the model line is the first front-wheel drive Ford developed and sold in North America. The direct successor of the Ford Pinto, as the smallest Ford car in North America, the Escort largely replaced the European-imported Ford Fiesta.\n\nOvercoming the tarnished reputation for quality and safety established by the fuel tank defect of the Pinto, the Escort became highly successful in the American marketplace. After 1982, the model line became the best-selling car in the United States, a position it held during most of the 1980s.\n\nThe 1981 replacement of the Pinto by the Escort was the first Ford model line to adapt front-wheel drive. By the end of the 1980s, nearly the entire Ford car range would adopt the powertrain layout (with the sole exception of the Mustang, Thunderbird, and LTD Crown Victoria/Country Squire).\n\nThe Escort was produced across three generations. The first was the first Ford \"world car\", designed as Ford of Europe transitioned the Escort Mk III to front-wheel drive. In North America, the model line was also sold as the Mercury Lynx and the two-seat Ford EXP/Mercury LN7 (no version was sold by the Lincoln division). Introduced for 1991, the second generation became a near-twin of the Mazda-designed Ford Laser (a model line sold in Asia and Oceania); sharing a platform and powertrain with the Mazda 323, the Escort grew into the compact car segment. The second generation was also sold as the Mercury Tracer. For 1997, the third generation was an extensive redesign of the second-generation platform Escort sedan, introducing the ZX2 coupe; Mercury continued to sell the Tracer sedan/wagon.\n\nFor the 1999 model year, the Ford Focus succeeded the Escort as the compact model line as a new-generation \"world car\"; after the 2000 model year, the Escort shifted primarily to fleet sales, ending production after the 2002 model year.\n\nDuring its entire production, the Escort was produced by Wayne Stamping & Assembly (Wayne, Michigan) and Hermosillo Stamping and Assembly (Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico); the first generation was also produced by Edison Assembly (Edison, New Jersey), San Jose Assembly Plant (Milpitas, California), and Oakville Assembly (Oakville, Ontario, Canada)\n\nThe first North American Escort went on sale on October 3, 1980 for the 1981 model year, along with its corporate twin, the Mercury Lynx. It was intended to share common components with the European Mk III Escort. It was launched with a , 1.6-liter hemi overhead cam inline-four. It was available as a three-door hatchback and as a five-door station wagon, with a four-speed manual or a three-speed automatic. The five-door hatchback was first shown in May 1981. The North American Escort had considerably more chrome than Escorts sold elsewhere (except for the 1981 SS model and 1982+ GT models which feature blacked out trim). 1981 models never had the blue oval logo; on the front fenders there was an Escort badge which included a globe representing the earth, which implied this was a \"World Car\".\n\nThe car was freshened in 1982, and added Ford's blue oval logo for the first time along with a new grille. For 1982 models, the base price of the Escort 3-door was $5,518. The engine was also uprated, to . In March 1982 a HO (High Output) version of the engine was added, originally only in the EXP and with an automatic transmission, but soon thereafter available with a manual and also in the sporting Escort GT. This unit produces , thanks to a higher compression ratio, a new exhaust system, and larger venturis in the carburetor. In addition to the HO engine, the GT featured cosmetic changes such as \"GT\" emblems and stripes, while under the shell there were uprated brakes and a close-ratio four-speed gearbox. Also included were metric TR sport wheels with Michelin TRX tires.\n\nFor 1984, the GLX model was dropped and replaced with a fuel injected LX model, available as a five-door hatchback or wagon, with a GT engine, blackout trim, and styled cast aluminum wheels. The interior received a new dashboard, and a new rubber shift boot for manual models; automatic models received a new gear selector lever with a straight line for gear selection instead of the twisting \"?\" mark pattern of the previous models. Flush headlamps, revised taillamps and restyled steel wheels appeared when the Escort was revised and introduced as the 1985½ Ford Escort. There was also the Ford EXP, and sister version Mercury LN7, targeting the sports car market, essentially a two-seat hatch with lower roofline which was not as successful as other body styles.\n\nAlthough the basic silhouette was the same, it was almost completely different from the European version, apart from the Ford CVH engine. There was a 1.6 L engine, a 4-speed MTX-2 and a 5-speed MTX-3 manual transmission as standard options, and an optional 3-speed ATX/FLC automatic transmission. A 1.3 L engine was designed and prototyped but did not see production due to lack of power, and an inability to get it certified. Beginning in 1983, a GT model offered a multi-port EFI version of the 1.6 L four-cylinder that increased power by 20 hp over the base carbureted version. It also came with a 5-speed transmission, TRX handling package, front and rear spoilers, metric-sized alloy wheels and fog lights. Also beginning with the 1984 model year, the Ford EXP received the option of the turbocharged 1.6 L four-cylinder rated at and matching torque. The turbo engine then found its way into the Escort GT (and Lynx RS) as well during the 1984 model year. 1984 was also the year that Mazda's 2-liter diesel engine became available in the Escort and Lynx.\n\n\nThe 1985½ model received a facelift (less chrome, restyled tail lamps, flush headlights), and the 1.6 L engine was replaced with a 1.9 L. GT models featured a high output engine with revised intake manifold, cylinder head and a real header available only with a manual transmission. The Lynx was retired for 1987, but was replaced by the Mazda 323-derived \"Tracer\" model. [This Mazda platform was revamped in 1989 and debuted as the 1990 Mazda Protege. The updated platform would form the basis for the next generation (1990–1996) Escort/Tracer.]\n\nThe Escort saw another minor facelift in mid-1988, which smoothed out the front and rear fascias. New plastic bumpers (which replaced the metal bumpers), larger rear side windows, a more rounded rear-end design and larger (14 inch versus 13 inch) wheels modernized the look of the cars. Three-door hatchback models had a curving windowline along the side towards the rear of the car. The engine was also updated with a slightly revised camshaft and roller lifters. The new design is commonly referred to as the \"88.5\" year, and existed until the end of the 1990 model year.\n\nFinding some popularity during the final three years of this generation was the Pony model, which was the least-expensive U.S.-built Ford at the time. Pony models used plainer interior trim with greater use of vinyl and plastic instead of cloth, and a 4-speed manual transaxle was standard, although buyers could opt for the 5-speed found in LX models or the 3-speed ATX automatic. The list of available options was very limited, to the extent that such luxuries as power steering and factory-installed air conditioning were not offered (a dealer-installed A/C system was available). Given their lighter weight, Pony models were known for their ability to deliver excellent fuel economy—mileage upwards of in highway driving was not uncommon.\n\n\n\n1981 – All-new model – the Escort was a world car. Original trims were Base, L, GL, GLX and SS. Mercury Lynx is Escort's twin.\n\n1982 – The GT replaced the SS. There were now new trims as the Base, L, GL, GLX and GT.\n\nFor 1991, the Escort and the Mercury Tracer were replaced by models based on the Mazda B platform (BG), which was also used by the Mazda 323, Protegé and first generation Kia Sephia. Ford, which owned a 25% stake in Mazda, already sold a version of the 323/Familia in Asia and Australasia, called the Ford Laser, which had replaced the old rear-wheel drive Escort there. Although the Escort was now essentially a twin of the Laser instead of the European Escort, it kept the Escort name in North America due to strong brand equity on the Escort name as well as Chrysler already using the Laser name on the Plymouth equivalent of the Mitsubishi Eclipse.\n\nThe prior Escort used localized engines and shared some elements of design with the European model. The Escort for the 1990s, however, would be almost identical to the Ford Laser and its derivatives, with minor differences in appearance and base engine. While the Laser would feature identical powertrains to the Mazda Familia, the Escort carried over the 1.9 liter 8-valve Ford-designed CVH engine from the previous Escort, with the GT and LX-E receiving the Mazda-built 1.8 L \"BP\" I4. Much of the external styling mimicked the first generation Ford Taurus, no doubt Ford's hope to give the Escort the appeal of that successful model.\n\nThis generation of the Escort was one of the first Ford automobiles to feature, on the 1.9 L engine, distributorless ignition (known as EDIS, Electronic Distributorless Ignition System). It also featured a new electronically controlled 4-speed automatic transmission, as well as an independent rear suspension, both (at the time) relatively uncommon in cars in this class.\n\nThe Mazda-based model sold sluggishly in America at first, since only hatchback models were offered upon launch, but became popular later by 1992, after the sedan was introduced, available in either LX or LX-E trim levels.\n\nFor the 1993–1995 model years, Ford offered the Escort on a \"one price\" basis, with the same price for a three- or five-door hatchback, a sedan or a wagon when equipped with the most popular options (3-doors quickly added alloy wheels to the \"one price\" specification). The LX-E, equipped with the same sporting equipment as the GT and Mazda Protegé LX (four-wheel disc brakes, larger front brakes, larger clutch, equal-length driveshafts, larger anti-roll bars, dual-outlet exhaust, sport interior and 1.8 L Mazda DOHC 16-valve engine), lasted only until 1993. The Pony departed in 1992, replaced by the Standard trim level.\n\nTrim levels were originally Pony, LX, and GT. The GT was the North American equivalent of the Laser XR3i version, featuring a 1.8 L Mazda DOHC engine. The LX and Standard or Pony were equipped with the 1.9 L overhead cam 8-valve CVH inline 4. The Pony or later Standard was the base trim level, lacking most features like power steering or a radio. The LX was the upscale trim level, and a Sport package could be added to make it look like a GT. Subtle differences can be noticed in all three Escort models (sedan, hatchback and wagon) from 1990 to 1996. In 1992, the grill oval hall around the \"Ford\" emblem became a little larger in order to allow more air to enter under the hood to cool the engine. In 1993, the wheel size was changed from 13 inches to 14 inches and the black exterior door handles were changed to match the exterior color of the car. A driver's airbag was introduced in 1993 as well, and by 1994, both driver and passenger airbags were standard with the redesigned dash for the 1995 model year.\n\n\nThe restyle dropped the hatchbacks and added a new sporty coupe for the 1997 model year.\n\nThe 1998 Escort ZX2 replaced the Ford Probe as Ford's sport compact car. The ZX2 was a much lower-slung and rakish car than either the Escort sedan and wagon, aimed squarely at the youth market as a replacement for the Escort GT (although lacking the latter's rear disc brake setup) and was built exclusively at Ford's Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico assembly plant. The interior was refreshed for 1999, and the model was retired after 2003. It had a completely redesigned dashboard, and included a panel that unified the heat and radio controls, similar to that of the third generation Ford Taurus.\n\nThe 1998 Escort ZX2 coupe featured the 2.0 L, Zetec DOHC four-cylinder engine as standard equipment, an option unavailable on the sedan or wagon. Intended for use as the base engine in the larger European Ford Mondeo and its American cousins, the Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique, the Zetec gave the ZX2 more-than-respectable performance, running 0–60 in 7.4 seconds.\n\nThe 1999 and 2000 models offered a performance limited edition ZX2 S/R which further enhanced the car's performance in every aspect.\n\nThe Escort sedan and wagon used the lower-powered CVH SPI2000 engine with . Subtle differences can be noticed in the Escort sedan from 1996 to 2002. The trim lines for 1997 were base and LX, for 1998–2002 it was offered in LX and SE trims. For 1999, the reverse lights were moved into the same piece as the tail lamps; they were previously below the tail lamp on the body.\n\nA very rare trim package could be found with chrome wheel covers and other features. It was offered in 1999.\n\nThe Escort was offered in a Sport package as well. The Mercury Tracer's version was called the Trio or Sport depending on the year. A basketweave type of wheel was put on the Tracer Trio while a flower petal pattern was used on the Tracer Sport. The Sport/Trio package included aluminum wheels, sport exhaust tip, a tachometer, and a rear decklid spoiler.\n\nThe Escort wagon largely retained the same body style, gaining only the new interior, front end & fascia, side-view mirrors, door handles, badging, and slightly restyled taillamps & reflectors. The black window frames on the doors of some models became body-colored.\n\nBoth the Escort wagon and the Mercury Tracer sedan and wagon were discontinued after 1999. The Escort sedan was discontinued in 2002, but continued to be sold as fleet & rental cars only. It was replaced by the Ford Focus . The last Ford Escort rolled off the assembly line on February 20, 2002. The last ZX2 rolled off the assembly line on March 21, 2003. In Mexico, it was replaced by the smaller Ford Ikon.\n\n\nFor 2001, the 4-door sedan was limited to fleet sales only and the Escort moniker on the Escort ZX2 was quietly dropped, making the car officially just ZX2 as a 2-door notchback coupe.\n\nThe Ford Focus debuted in 1998 (1999 in U.S.) and was produced concurrently with the ZX2. Though not without its fans, both then and now, and still fairly well represented in the automotive aftermarket, the ZX2 was replaced by the Focus ZX3, ZX4 and ZX5. Though the two cars shared the same Zetec engine, there were a few differences. The Focus lacked the exhaust-side VCT, and contained less aggressive camshafts that pushed the power band down a few hundred RPM. The two models shared the same block but, due to the different camshafts and the different cylinder head, the torque output for the Focus was bumped up by . Thanks to better gearing and less weight, the ZX2 continued to outperform the Focus. The ZX2 continued with little more than alloy wheels and a rear defroster now offered as standard equipment, and for 2003, a revised front fascia. Production ceased at the end of the 2003 model year.\n\nThe increased presence and success of tuner models from overseas in the late 90s caused Ford to create their own performance model, the ZX2 S/R. Meant to compete with cheap factory performance sport compacts such as the Honda Civic Si or the Dodge Neon ACR, Ford created the ZX2 S/R to show that they had plenty to bring to the table. Its initial debut was at SEMA's Import Auto Salon in Pomona in 1999. The ZX2 S/R was the first product jointly developed by Ford Racing and Ford Motor Company's Small Vehicle Center Product Development.\n\nFord's final limited production count was 2,110 units, consisting of 110 yellow S/Rs for 1999, the first two of which were sold in Columbus, Ohio, and the other 108 in California; and for 2000, 500 black, 500 red and 1,000 yellow S/Rs were sold. The upgrade price to the S/R package was $1,500 in both years. It is believed that only 35 of those 2000 S/Rs were sold in Canada, making it a very rare trim there.\n\nThe optional S/R package adds stiffer suspension parts (Eibach springs (M-5560-Z2), Tokico struts (M-18000-Z2) and Energy Suspension brand polyurethane suspension bushings), more power (through a Ford Racing PCM (M-12650-Z2)), more efficient intake (Roush or Iceman), rear disc brakes (M-2300-Z2), a stronger clutch (Centerforce dual friction M-7560-Z2), a short-throw B&M manual-transmission shifter (M-7210-Z2), an S/R-unique shift knob (M-7213-Z2) and boot (M-7277-Z2), upgraded seats, a unique blue valve cover, a different speed cluster that goes up to and a unique tire/wheel package. Engine power was increased 10% over the base Zetec engine used in the ZX2 to , courtesy of a recommended premium fuel re-calibration, new air inlet system, the performance PCM, improved Borla muffler and pipe (M-5230-Z2). All ZX2 S/R have a special \"S/R\" badge on the back, either silver (on a red car) or red (on a yellow or black car). Some S/R went out of the assembly plant without some of the performance mods (example: missing the Centerforce clutch). The suspension bushings were not installed at the factory but instead packaged with the car for installation at the dealership. This also led to many cars leaving the showroom without the full complement of S/R parts.\n\n"}
{"id": "2227755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227755", "title": "Horch", "text": "Horch\n\nHorch was a car brand manufacturer, founded in Germany by August Horch & Cie at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nIt is one of the predecessors of the present day Audi company, which itself resulted from the merger of Auto Union Aktiengesellschaft (AG) and NSU Motorenwerke in 1969. Auto Union AG in turn was formed in 1932, following the merger of Horch DKW, Wanderer and the original Audi Automobilwerke GmbH Zwickau, established by August Horch in 1910.\n\nAccording to insiders, a resurrection is planned.\n\nAugust Horch and his first business partner Salli Herz established the company on November 14, 1899 in the district of Ehrenfeld, Cologne in Cologne. August Horch had previously worked as a production manager for Karl Benz. Three years later, in 1902, he moved the company to Reichenbach im Vogtland. On May 10, 1904 he founded the Horch & Cie. Motorwagenwerke AG, a joint-stock company in Zwickau (Kingdom of Saxony). The city of Zwickau was the capital of the South Western Saxon County and one of Saxony's industrial centres at that time.\n\nAfter troubles with the Horch chief financial officer, August Horch founded a second company on 16 July 1909, the August Horch Automobilwerke GmbH in Zwickau. He had to rename the company because \"Horch\" was already a registered brand and he did not hold the rights to the name. On 25 April 1910 the name Audi Automobilwerke was entered in the company's register at the Zwickau registration court. \"Audi\" is the Latin translation of \"horch\", from the German verb \"horchen\", which means \"listen!\" (compare English \"hark\"). The Audi name was proposed by a son of one of Horch's business partners from Zwickau.\n\nIn 1932 both companies from Zwickau (Horch and Audi) merged with Zschopauer Motorenwerke J. S. Rasmussen (the DKW brand) and the Wanderer car-production facilities to become the Auto Union corporation of Saxony. The Silver Arrow racing cars of the Auto Union racing team in Zwickau—developed by Ferdinand Porsche and Robert Eberan von Eberhorst, and driven by Bernd Rosemeyer, Hans Stuck, Tazio Nuvolari and Ernst von Delius—became known the world over in the 1930s.\n\nThe company initially began producing and twin-cylinder engine automobiles near Cologne in 1901.\n\nThe first Horch had a engine, with an alloy crankcase, a unique achievement in those days. It had an open-body design, with lighting provided by lanterns with candles in them. In contrast with the powerful cars of later years, the first Horch could barely reach a top speed of . It was significant at that time because it used a friction clutch, and also had a drive shaft to power the wheels.\n\nThe firm soon ran into financial troubles, not surprising considering the pioneering nature of the automobile business at that time. Horch had to seek new partners.\n\nIn March 1902, August Horch produced a four-cylinder car with a shaft drive in Reichenbach in Vogtland. Horch cars were considered more advanced and superior to those being then built by Mercedes or Benz (who were then separate manufacturers).\n\nBy 1903, Horch had built a car with a four-cylinder engine. In March of the following year, he introduced his new car at the Frankfurt Fair.\n\nIn 1904, August Horch developed the first six-cylinder engine, which appeared in 1907. In 1906 a Horch automobile driven by Dr. Rudolf Stöss from Zwickau won the Herkomer Competition (equivalent to a 'brand-name' world championship at the time). In the 1920s, Moritz Stauss, a cosmopolitan Berliner, was the principal stockholder of the Horch company. He succeeded in making the Horch brand highly desirable by introducing art into the advertising of their products. He recognized that only a brand emphasising Horch's unique characteristics would be successful.\n\nIn 1923, Paul Daimler (a Stauss associate) worked for Horch as the chief engineer for 8-cylinder engines. Horch vehicles were subsequently the first to introduce 8-cylinder engines in series production.\n\nIn 1909, the supervisory board (the German equivalent of the Board of Directors) of the corporation forced out Horch. Horch went on to found Audi as Audiwerke GmbH, which became effective on 25 April 1910. The name was a solution to the legal dispute with his old company over use of the Horch brand and a clever play of words (\"audi\" is the literal Latin translation of the Old German \"horch\", meaning the imperative \"Listen!\").\n\nIn 1928, the company was acquired by Jørgen Skafte Rasmussen, owner of DKW (from the German \"Dampfkraftwagen\", or steam engine vehicle) who had bought the remains of the US automobile manufacturer Rickenbacker in the same year. The Rickenbacker purchase included their manufacturing equipment for eight-cylinder engines.\n\nEventually, on 29 June 1932, Horch, Audi, DKW and Wanderer merged to form the Auto Union AG, Chemnitz affiliated group. The current Audi four-ring logo is the Auto Union logo that represents the merger of these four brands. In the 1930s, Horch introduced a new line of smaller and cheaper, but still presentable, V8 automobiles. In 1936, Horch presented the 25,000th 8-cylinder luxury car in Zwickau.\n\nThe Auto Union Grand Prix racing cars types A to D, were developed and built by a specialist racing department of Horch works in Zwickau between 1933 and 1939. Between 1935 and 1937 Auto Union cars won 25 races, driven by Ernst von Delius, Tazio Nuvolari, Bernd Rosemeyer, Hans Stuck and Achille Varzi.\nAuto Union became a major supplier of vehicles to the German Wehrmacht, such as Heavy standard passenger car (Horch 108), Medium standard passenger car (Horch 901 and Wanderer 901) and Half-track Sd.Kfz. 11. Civilian production was suspended after March 1940. After the war the Auto Union AG at Chemnitz was dissolved and in Ingolstadt, West Germany the new Auto Union GmbH was founded, where civilian car production continued. Due to widespread poverty in postwar Germany, only small DKW vehicles with two stroke engines were produced. After Auto Union was purchased in 1964 by the Volkswagenwerk AG, the old brand \"Audi\" was introduced again, together with the new four stroke vehicle Audi F103. Daimler-Benz retained the trademark rights to the Horch brand until the mid 1980s. Daimler-Benz then transferred the rights to the Horch brand name to Audi who in turn signed a waiver to use the name „Silberpfeil“ (silver-arrow) for any modern Audi racing car.The brand has, however, remained dormant.\n\nThe Romanian Army purchased 300 Horch 901 4x4 field cars to mechanize some of its anti-tank companies.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the factories suffered heavy bomb damage. Later, the advancing Soviet forces captured the area, and it became part of the Soviet sector of divided Germany in 1945, and later became part of East Germany.\n\nFrom 1955 to 1958, old Horch factories produced the Horch P240, a six-cylinder car that was respected at the time. The former Horch and \"Audi\" operations from Zwickau were unified in 1958. A new brand, \"Sachsenring\", within the East German corporation IFA was born. After unification in 1958, the P240 car was renamed as the Sachsenring P240. As the Soviet Administration inexplicably banned the foreign exportation of the P240, the East German economic administration decided to stop production of the vehicle. IFA also produced the initial Trabant \"P-50\" model from 1957.\n\nThe Zwickau site was acquired in 1991 by Volkswagen, effectively restoring its connection with Audi.\n\nOn June 24, 2006, a rare 1937 Horch 853A Sport Cabriolet in original unrestored, unprepared condition sold at auction in Cortland, NY for US$299,000.\n\nIn the late 1930s, Horch supplied a limited number of promotional scarves bearing the Horch logo. Sent only to the wealthiest drivers, it is a major collectible amongst diehard enthusiasts of the pre-war car era. However, there is also a degree of controversy associated with these scarves as they were commonly sought by senior SS members.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2227758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227758", "title": "ITV Nightscreen", "text": "ITV Nightscreen\n\nITV Nightscreen is a scheduled programme on the ITV television network, consisting of a sequence of animated pages of information about ITV's upcoming programmes, features and special events, with an easy listening music soundtrack. The programme is used to fill the station's overnight downtime, where a closedown would have once been used at the end of programmes. The programme is generally shown 7 days a week with the typical weekday show airing from 03:50am – 05:05am daily.\n\nOn STV, UTV and in the Channel Islands the programme starts earlier, sometimes as early as midnight, breaking for a signed programme at 3am before resuming and occasionally in Scotland it has been known to broadcast continually from 1:00 am to 6:00 am without a break. However on ITV's digital channels, the amount of Teleshopping affects how much Nightscreen is broadcast and also on ITV during Summer & Christmas and on emergency recovery test more hours are being broadcast as live Jackpot 24/7 is not shown - thus sees the Nightscreeen broadcasting until 5:05am–6:00am non stop. Very occasionally it is not broadcast due to live events and other programming filling its hour. The programme also broadcasts on all of ITV's +1 channels.\n\nIt was first broadcast on 14 January 1998, and consisted of teletext pages taken from the ITV regional teletext services, with interstitial teletext-based animations in a similar style to the former \"4-Tel On View\". Since 2003 the screens have been produced using Scala InfoChannel3. In early 2009, updated systems were installed with the latest version of Scala5, with a dual redundant system to counter any issues of service. In April 2012, the system was upgraded again to a newer version of Scala5. This, amongst other minor presentational changes, allowed compatibility of the service to be transmitted in 16:9 widescreen for the first time, as opposed to 4:3.\n\n\"Nightscreen\" has, in the past, been criticised for highlighting programmes which had already aired, and for some careless typing and spelling errors but now regularly avoids doing this. As well as providing focus on upcoming programmes, films and TV listings, it also offers some news from the world of entertainment. In the past it also offered sports news and even on some occasions cooking tips, recipes and also fact files of characters from famous ITV shows such as \"Emmerdale\" and \"Coronation Street\".\n\nThe Scala system was provided by Beaver Group, and the programme is currently produced by Gower Creative Communications. The Soundtracks are supplied by KPM Music (These can be found in the Libraries of Juice On Demand (JMOD), Juice Music (JM) & KPM FTV Media Online (KPMFTVOL). A few of the soundtracks can also be found on YouTube.).\n\nTeletext screens had been employed by the BBC since 1980 and by Channel 4 since 1983 to fill airtime cheaply. In-vision teletext was only ever occasionally used on the ITV network. From April 1986 certain regions, firstly Central Independent Television, followed in January 1987 by Yorkshire Television, started showing overnight teletext sequences containing details of local job vacancies under the title \"Jobfinder\". Initially the pages were broadcast for an hour after the end of regular programming but from April 1987 Central broadcast Jobfinder throughout their overnight downtime. When 24-hour television began in 1988, the majority of ITV regions broadcast a Jobfinder programme in the hour preceding the . Also, for a short while in 1987, an Oracle-provided service preceding TV-am broadcasts, known as \"Daybreak\", was broadcast before the start of TV-am's programming.\n\n\"ITV Nightscreen\"'s origins can also be found in a programme simply titled \"Freescreen\", which was made and screened by Meridian Broadcasting in its early years. The Meridian version mixed the teletext pages with local news stories and short videos made and sent in by viewers.\n\n\"ITV Nightscreen\" is broadcast on ITV, STV and UTV starting from when the last programme finishes and ending at 05:05 most weekdays and at 06:00 at weekends and holidays. ITV2 often broadcasts the filler starting at around 05:00 and ending at 06:00. Its availability on ITV3, ITV4, and itv be is dependent on how much unused time is left, and can sometimes last for as little as five minutes on 3, 4, and Encore (as teleshopping is shown on ITV3 and ITV4 between 03:00 and 06:00. Although not an ITV-branded channel, ITV's defunct Men & Motors channel would in its later years carry the filler from the close of programming until 06:00; between 06:00 and the start of programmes at 11:00, M&M would broadcast an animated caption card or teleshopping presentations.\n\nIn its early years, \"Nightscreen\" would take up most of the early morning schedule, often starting at 02:00 or 03:00 and finishing before the \"\".\n\nIn December 2005, three months before the now defunct ITV Play began transmitting, a quiz show entitled \"Quizmania\" began broadcasting in the early hours on ITV. Subsequent programmes that followed were \"The Mint\", \"Make Your Play\" and \"Glitterball\". This resulted in \"Nightscreen\" being pushed back to just a half-hour service between 05:00 and 05:30.\n\nIn 2008, largely as a result of widespread scandal surrounding phone-ins, ITV Play was permanently axed, since when \"Nightscreen\" now regularly runs from around 04:00. ITV Channel Television previously ran its own version of the service entitled \"Channel Nightscreen\" consisting of local news headlines and programming information. Channel Nightscreen was axed towards the end of 2011 shortly after ITV plc brought Channel Television. \nIn mid-2010, ITV started airing \"The Zone\" for 2 hours, a gaming and shopping programme block, usually airing from 00:30 to 02:30, leaving \"Nightscreen\" often cut back to as little as an hour and sometimes removed from ITV's schedule altogether.\n\nIn April 2010, STV launched its own Scottish night-time service, \"The Nightshift\", broadcast in the STV Central region and consisting of programming highlights, news, competitions and viewers texts & emails read out by a live out-of-vision presenter. STV North continued to broadcast \"ITV Nightscreen\" until July 2010, when \"The Nightshift\" was extended to the North region. The programme included regional news opt-outs for the four STV sub-regions: Aberdeen & the North, Dundee & Tayside, Edinburgh & the East and Glasgow & the West. STV dropped \"The Nightshift\" from its schedules in June 2015, meaning \"Nightscreen\" was extended on the station, usually running from around 02:00 until just after 05:00 (06:00 at the weekend).\n\nOn 1 August 2019, home shopping channel Ideal World began simulcasting during part of the overnight period on ITV, however, it is not able to be viewed on ITV Hub. Consequently, the two bursts of Nightscreen on UTV and Channel have now ceased as these regions now follow network scheduling due to there being no restrictions about them showing Ideal World, unlike the previous gaming programmes. STV still shows the service from not long after 1 am till 5 or 6 am depending upon schedule requirements. Sometimes Nightscreen is scheduled between blocks of teleshopping on ITV2, 3 and 4. On ITVBe, Nightscreen is shown for the small amount of time after the last programme before 5 or more hours of teleshopping is shown. Former ITV channel ITV Encore used the service to fill left time in nighttime programming. The CITV channel does not use the service as their channel finishes at 9pm.\n\nA similar filler to ITV Nightscreen was also provided by RTÉ, who currently uses this to fill airtime cheaply on RTÉ Two. It is very similar in fashion to ITV Nightscreen as it provides rolling teletext pages while RTÉ Two is not broadcasting. It has been criticised by many FAI League of Ireland fans who have dubbed the service \"Errortel\" due to the constant inaccuracies, delays & incorrect information with live scoring and reporting of games.\n\nCeefax was the BBC's teletext information service transmitted via the analogue signal, started in 1974 and continued to run until the UK analogue switch off in October 2012. In-vision Ceefax broadcasts started in 1980, initially as a daytime filler, but as programme hours expanded Ceefax was shown before the start of programming. From 1995 until October 2012 they were seen on BBC Two late at night, most commonly at the weekend but occasionally during the week. The final broadcast was in the early hours of Monday 22 October 2012, two days before Ceefax was switched off when digital switchover was completed. Broadcasts on BBC One had ceased in November 1997 when BBC News was launched as BBC One carries BBC News overnight although occasional Ceefax broadcasts were seen on BBC One Scotland.\n\nOriginally broadcast on weekdays, it alternated with showings of the IBA ETP-1 testcard and \"Oracle On View.\" From 1983 until the start of Channel 4's breakfast television service in April 1989, the 4-Tel magazine ran for 15 minutes and was repeated several times each day with transmissions airing at increasingly earlier times of the day as Channel 4 expanded its broadcast hours. In April 1989 Channel 4 began broadcasting programming at breakfast and 4-Tel On View was reduced to a 40-minute slot between 05:20 and 06:00 although from 1993 4-Tel was broadcast throughout Channel 4's closedown period. It was last seen in January 1997 as this was when Channel 4 began broadcasting a 24-hour television service.\n\nWas aired from 1983 until 1989 on Channel 4. The fifteen-minute bursts were originally broadcast at :30 to :45 minutes past the hour but changed to :15 to :30 minutes past in October 1984.

Its capital is the city of Artigas, which borders on the Brazilian city of Quaraí. Artigas Department has an area of , making it the fifth largest in the country. The population is 73,378 inhabitants, according to the 2011 census.\n\nIt is bordered on the north and east by Brazil, from which it is separated by the Cuareim River. To the south, Artigas Department borders on Salto Department, and to the west is Argentina, from which it is separated by the Uruguay River. Artigas is the only Uruguayan department that borders two other countries.\n\nThe department and its capital city are named after José Gervasio Artigas (1764–1850), leader of the \"Orientales\" (inhabitants of the \"Banda Oriental\", the Eastern bank of the Uruguay River) during Uruguay's wars of independence.\n\nOwner region of a prehistoric past which later became \"no man's land\" between the Spanish and Portuguese empires. The initial indigenous predominance (chanás-charrúas-Guarani) was displaced by the native settlement and subsequent colonies of immigrants.\n\nArtigas department was created by law on 1 October 1884, on territory previously belonged to the department of Salto; from that date it is designated to Villa de San Eugenio as capital, which in 1915 passed to the category of city with the name of Artigas, capital of the department with the same name in tribute to the national hero of Uruguay José Gervasio Artigas. He was linked to the fact Colonel Carlos Lecueder, first politician and police chief Artigas.\n\nIts capital Artigas comes at the end of the \"Guerra Grande\" in order to consolidate the borders with Brazil, with the name of San Eugenio del Cuareim. It was founded on September 12, 1852 by Don Carlos Catala, choosing as the best site located on the banks of the Cuareim River opposite the Villa San Juan Bautista on the other side of the river, which was a military settlement that was then transformed into what is today the city of Quaraí.\n\nWith the name of Santa Rosa del Cuareim was founded the current Bella Union by Fructuoso Rivera and refugees Guarani after the campaign Eastern Missions against Brazil in 1829. In 1852 after winning the allies Colorados Brazil national, territory north of Cuareim was yielded to Brazil which prompted an evacuation of the population. It was refounded in 1853 under the name of Santa Rosa de la Bella Union Quareim. In 1929 the national government to mark the centenary of the campaign of Missions, sent a bill to the Senate, which established the name Bella Union, which for that time was a villa .\n\nTwo portions of the department's border with Brazil are disputed (\"Isla Brasilera\" or Brazilian Island near Bella Unión, and an area called \"Rincón de Artigas\" near Masoller), but unlike many border disputes between Latin American countries, this issue has not strained Uruguay's relations with Brazil, which remain friendly.\n\nTwo main geostructural regions can be found inside Artigas' limits:\n\nArtigas Department's average temperature is the highest in the whole country (over 19°C or 66°F, and may go as high as 47°C or 116°F during the summer months). So are its precipitation levels (up to an annual average of 1400 mm).\n\nThe unique climatic conditions of Artigas has made possible the development of an important agro-industrial centre around the city of Bella Unión. Several crops are planted, namely fruits and vegetables, sugar cane, and rice. In the rest of the department, the main economic activity is livestock raising.\n\nSemi-precious gemstones, such as agates and amethysts, are also found in the department, and an entire industry has risen up around their extraction and manufacturing, especially near the capital city of Artigas.\n\nThe proximity of the department to Brazil has made it possible for an important flow of trade to be established here, but unfortunately this is generally unfavorable to Uruguayan economic interests. Nevertheless, this partially compensates for the fact that the per capita income is the lowest of the country, and the percentage of households in poverty is the highest in the country (13.19% of the inhabitants).\n\nAs of the census of 2011, the Artigas Department had a population of 73,378 (36,079 male and 37,299 female) and 26,231 households.\n\nDemographic data for Artigas Department in 2010:\n\"2010 Data Source:\"\nAccording to the 2011 census, Artigas department has a rural population of 3,524.\n\n"}

It shows programming aimed at students in Primary, Secondary and Higher Education and to adult learners. Viewers are encouraged to watch programmes after the original broadcast via the use of, originally VHS, currently DVD. In 2015, the BBC confirmed that due to budget cuts, the service would no longer be running.\n\nThe BBC Learning Zone was launched as The Learning Zone on 9 October 1995, as an extension service of BBC2, to free up more of their schedule. Previously, these educational programmes had been based on the channel in mornings and often until the early afternoon on weekdays. However, following the channel's rebranding to the '2' idents and the increased viewer perception that resulted from it, the channel was anxious to use more of their daytime for different programming. The Learning Zone was the solution to this problem.\n\nThe idea had been around for a while: by 1995 both ITV and Channel 4 were operating as 24-hour channels, freeing up their prime time and daytime schedules. The BBC attempted producing specialist television overnight by launching BBC Select. This service played out encrypted programming for professions such as medicine and law overnight between 1992 and 1995. Also, from the start of 1993, some BBC Schools programmes were shown (as subject blocks or a series block) overnight as part of a new experiment called Night School.\n\nThe service would begin after BBC Two's closedown and transfer to Pages from Ceefax, with the service beginning at 12.30am (2am on Monday mornings) until 7.00am (3.00-5.00am Fridays and Saturdays). In 2004 the service started at 2am every day and continuing until approximately 6am when programming on BBC Two would begin, however this was not always the case. The service then ran between 4am and 6am, and usually did not operate when schools were not open (Summer, Easter Holidays etc.).\n\nIn 1997, when the BBC rebranded, The Learning Zone was renamed BBC Learning Zone, became a separate strand of programming in its own right and became independent of BBC Two. \n\nIn 2015, the BBC confirmed that 'due to budget cuts', the service would be no longer be running on BBC Two. Instead, it was said to be moving online on the BBC Education and BBC Teach websites. The final BBC Learning Zone aired in the early hours of 24 July 2015. \n\nThe service, upon launch, was used for the transfer of programming, including the bulk of Open University programming, secondary school programming previously from the BBC Schools strand as well as other programming.\n\nProgramming was divided up into segments, as seen below:\n\nThese segments ran on alternate days and for only certain times of the year. The segments and programming may be changed during exam seasons, so programming is revision orientated, with the programme Bitesize being a staple of the schedule.\n\nOn 15 December 2006, the last Open University programme was broadcast on the service, following which the strand was removed from the service. Schools programmes ended when BBC Learning Zone finished in 2015. Languages programmes (shown during the summer months) were dropped after Summer 2012. BBC Two instead now show rolling programme previews under the name 'This is BBC Two'. In 2010, the remaining primary schools programmes, previously shown at 11am for one hour during weekdays (except Wednesday), were transferred to the Learning Zone from BBC Two.\n\nUnusual among BBC services, few to no programme shown on the BBC Learning Zone is available to be watched again on the BBC iPlayer, due to rights restrictions on the programmes. As compensation, the BBC launched a section called Learning Zone Broadband, or more simply Class Clips which includes segments from Learning Zone as well as clips taken from other relevant BBC programmes. These clips were available to watch on demand over the internet for free. This service provided teachers and students with a range of resources, including case studies and experiments, to use in class or elsewhere. The service is no longer in use. Clips are now available on the BBC Teach website.\n\nUpon launch on 9 October 1995, the strand was introduced with a variation of the '2' idents and had a logo featuring an orange stylised Learning Zone logo.\n\nOn 6 October 1997, when the strand became separate, the station's current identification was created, showing an oak tree and an acorn. The acorn falls from a tree, while a number of identification processes take place, including a thermal image, a database match on computer, measurements taken, newspaper archives, aerodynamic investigation, cross section, 3D image and the name in different languages before the acorn finally falls to the ground and seeds to become an oak sapling. The ident is accompanied by an updated logo featuring the BBC logo and 'Learning Zone' written after in capital letters. The identification was generally only used at the beginning of the strand. Links between programmes were made using programme menus and continuity voice overs. Programme menus and static information slides were made using the logo at the bottom, and an image related to the identification featuring in the background. Very few programme slides and promotions were used.\n\nIn 2004, four supplementary idents were introduced to link into the programmes themselves. They still featured the 1997 presentational style and were based around the theme of the seasons, with one used each season. They featured the oak tree in the background and people at rest and play around it. The 1997 ident was still used to open the strand. Also introduced in 2004, were opening films to introduce the programme menu. These featured clips showing on screen of the programmes in the Learning Zone and of the acorn falling, before a version of the logo with back-lighting moving from left to right, accompanied by the music 'Wired' by Atmosphere Music Ltd. The programme menu was also redesigned with falling acorns as the background. Both new devices were colour-coded to the strand: blue for Open University, green for languages and red for schools.\n\nUnusually for a terrestrial BBC channel, the strand is accompanied by a BBC Two DOG in the top left corner of the screen. Other DOGs accompany the programmes, while some lengthy educational programmes include a timer in the top right corner to make it easier to scan and find the section the viewer wants.\n\nThe acorn ident is the longest BBC ident ever used, having beaten the BBC Two '2' idents in 2008.\n\n\n"}

The LOADDT enables the citizens of a community to form a legally recognized \"pays\" after deciding to do so by mutual consent; its aim is to help bring the inhabitants of urban and neighboring rural districts into dialogue and agreement.\n\nThe Council of Development in each \"pays\" assembles together the elected officials and the economic, social, and cultural actors, and their associates, into a deliberative forum to discuss the development policies which should be followed by the community. While the Council can give advice, submit proposals, and monitor development projects, it does not have the authority to make official decisions.\n\nThe Charter of the \"Pays\" makes it possible to fix the stakes and the objectives of the community. Few structures are recognized as \"pays Voynet\", meaning nationwide, because the recognition criteria are sometimes far from what the \"pays\" are. Then again, several \"pays\" are recognized by the Commission Régionale d'aménagement et de développement du Territoire.\n\nIn France, the contract of the \"Pays\" can be signed among the members of the \"pays\", or between the \"pays\" and its surrounding area, the department, the region, or with the national state when the stakes are well-identified.\n\nIn this context, the French term \"pays\" is not used in the modern sense of \"country\" but preserves the original meaning of the Latin word from which it was derived, \"pagus\", which designated the territory controlled by a medieval count. The majority of \"pays\" are roughly coextensive with the old counties (e.g., county of Comminges, county of Ponthieu, etc). Today \"Pays de France\" still refers to a tiny area in northwest Ile-de-France, hence city names such as \"Roissy-en-France\" or \"Tremblay-en-France\".\n\nAlthough this word is frequently translated into English as \"country,\" its usage can mean \"a region or territory of a nation (bounded by borders and constituting a geographical entity) considered from the point of view of a certain identity or community of interest of its inhabitants\". It is held to be \"the geographical basis of the state\". The word is also used less precisely as an alternative for \"état\" (state).\n\nBrittany, consisting of 4 departments, is also subdivided into 21 \"pays\".\n\n\nLa Franche-Comté, consisting of 4 departments, is also subdivided into 16 pays :\n\n"}

He came of a distinguished family, his father, Johann Friedrich Gottlieb Delbrück (d. 1830), having been preceptor of the two Prussian princes afterwards known as King Frederick William IV and Emperor William I. Rudolf von Delbrück studied in Halle, Bonn, and Berlin. On completing his legal studies, he entered the service of the state in 1837; and after holding a series of minor posts was transferred in 1848 to the ministry of commerce, which was to be the sphere of his real life's work.\n\nThe states of the German Confederation, including Prussia and the Austrian Empire, had realized the influence of commercial upon political union. Delbrück in 1851 induced Hanover, Oldenburg, and Schaumburg-Lippe, who formed the Steuerverein, to join the Zollverein; and the southern states, which had agreed to admit Austria to the union, found themselves forced in 1853 to renew the old union, from which Austria was excluded. Delbrück now began, with the support of Otto von Bismarck, to apply the principles of free trade to Prussian fiscal policy.\n\nIn 1862 Delbrück concluded an important commercial treaty with France. In 1867 he became the first president of the chancery of the North German Confederation, and represented Bismarck on the federal tariff council (Zollbundesrath), a position of political as well as fiscal importance owing to the presence in the council of representatives of the southern states. In. 1868 he became a Prussian minister without portfolio. In October 1870, when the union of Germany under Prussian headship became a practical question, Delbrück was chosen to go on a mission to the South German states, and contributed greatly to the agreements concluded at Versailles in November.\n\nIn 1871 Delbrück became president of the newly constituted Reichskanzleramt. Delbrück, however, began to feel himself uneasy under Bismarck's leanings towards protection and state control. On the introduction of Bismarck's plan for the acquisition of the railways by the state, Delbrück resigned office, nominally on the ground of ill-health (June 1, 1876). In 1879 he opposed in the Reichstag the new protectionist tariff, and on the failure of his efforts retired definitely from public life in 1881. In 1896 he received from William II the Order of the Black Eagle. He died at Berlin.\n"}

It was named after a woman in the miners camp called Elizabeth Stark Blakesley.\n\nIt is said that the value of gold taken from the Elizabethtown area ran into the millions of dollars. It was started from other gold mining camps all around American Valley (where Quincy, CA is now located). In 1852, a 10 to 15 family wagon train came up Beckwourth Pass (which was created by James Beckwourth, the first pioneer to this area). They brought a large supply of horses, oxen, cows, and other needed supplies and were the first settlers of American Valley. When they got there, they found a population of hundreds of Maidu Indians, which were peaceful and friendly.\n\nIn 1852 Alexander and Frank Tate discovered gold in what is known as Tate ravine. After that, Lewis Stark, Peter Day, and George Ferrier one morning went up Elizabeth ravine and by noon they panned out an ounce of gold. After dinner they found several ounces using a rocker. After digging a small ditch, they discovered one 28 ounce gold piece. After that many miners came to search for gold which developed into a village. Later on Elizabethtown was also known as Betysburg after a rivalry started with Quincy. The winter of 1852 and 1853 were very harsh with low provisions. So the spring of 1853 the Stark family went to Sacramento Valley and hauled up many cattle for beef for the starving families.\n\nIn 1854 a Masonic Lodge was built there. Also in 1854 Elizabethtown got postal service with Lewis Stark as Postmaster. W.A. Blakesley was the Deputy and used his house as the office. In January 1855 the postal service was moved to Quincy.\nThe rich mining claims of 1853 and 1854 were: The Wahoo, by Joseph Kelley & Co.; Fowler, by Fowler & Co.; Varner, by Varner & Co.; Plumas, by L.F. Cate & Co.; O'Neill, by Captain \nO'Neill; Gloyd, by D.J. Gloyd; and Betsy Guilch, by Stark & Co.\n\nThe Population of Elizabethtown got up around 2000 and 2500 people between 1853 and 1856. The first year over 30 county licenses were issued for business in the area. The Main Street extended across the entire town. There were many stores, two-story buildings, saloons, gambling houses, shops, gilded palaces, lodging houses, and eating houses. They also had a lodge for the Sons Of Temperance (see Temperance movement) which had over 200 members.\nIn 1857 and 1858 there was some demoralization within the town with the Comstock mines in Virginia City, Nevada (see Comstock Lode). Many residents ended up living in Indian and Honey Lake valleys. Many buildings were moved to Quincy and rebuilt there and slowly the town dissolved into history.\n\nAfter the \"New Year's Flood\" in January, 1997, a local resident discovered the cobblestone corner of a foundation had been exposed by the high water flow through the creek bed. The former excavations of the brick foundation has been covered over and no longer are visible.\n\nThere is a stone and metal monument to the town by the Native Sons and Daughters of Quincy on September 9, 1927.\n\n"}

As of the 2011 census it had a population of 104,028 and is the second most populated city in Uruguay.\n\nThe city is located on Route 3 about northwest of Montevideo, and on the east bank of the Río Uruguay across from the city of Concordia in Argentina. About north of the city the Salto Grande Bridge, built on top of the Salto Grande Dam, joins the two sides.\n\nBuilt on hills and bluffs, the city is situated near the Rio Uruguay's 'big jump' falls, which is also the location of the Salto Grande Dam. The land is low lying alongside the river bank, with an elevation of above sea level.\n\nDuring the Guarani War the governor of Rio de la Plata, José de Andonaegui, and the Marquis of Valdelirios pleaded with Governor José Joaquín de Viana to move north with an army of 400 men and enforce the terms of the Treaty of Madrid. In October 1756 Viana built several barracks for his army located in the area who had to survive on hunting and fishing. The sheds he built were called San Antonio del Salto Chico. Thus, the short-lived first settlement in the present city of Salto dates from 8 November 1756, which remains as its date of foundation. Some people say it was \"by chance\", such as the writer Francisco Bauza in his book \"Dominación española en Uruguay\". In 1757, Viana and the superior Governor of Buenos Aires, Pedro de Cevallos, built a strong fort called San Antonio. The fort had a chapel, which was under the patronage of San Antonio de Padua. Also in that period, Spanish troops captured the Portuguese colony at Colonia del Sacramento and used its facilities for seven years before abandoning it in 1763.\n\nOn 16 June 1768, the buildings in Salto were occupied by Francisco de Paula Bucareli with 1,500 soldiers seeking to expel the Jesuits from all Spanish territory, as ordered by Carlos III. The fort of San Antonio served as an arms depot and later as a prison for most of the priests, who were later taken to Buenos Aires or deported overseas. While the Jesuits were imprisoned Lieutenant Nicolás García took care of the fort and three boats. A big flood of the Yapeyú River caused considerable damage and the fort was rebuilt at a nearby site, this time on the western side of the Uruguay River in the current Concordia area, in order to act as a river-road junction. In early 1782 the settlement already had permanent residents.\n\nOn 12 February 1811 Francisco Javier de Elío declared war on the Board of Buenos Aires. Montevideo was besieged by José Rondeau and José Gervasio Artigas, so Elío asked for help from Portugal. Later the Spanish and the Board of Buenos Aires had to sign an agreement, because Buenos Aires was blockaded by sea. In an armistice agreement it decided to lift the siege of Montevideo and the blockade of the Rio de la Plata. However, General Artigas had to withdraw to the north in what became known at the Exodus of the Western People. Among the members of the Exodus of the Western People were a considerable number of important people in Uruguayan history, including some 6,000 military personnel and 4,500 civilians. In December 1811 they camped for one month on the Uruguay River very close to Salto. In that place the Board of Buenos Aires awarded the title of Lieutenant Governor, Chief Justice and Captain of the Department to Artigas who \"guided the revolutionaries in a ten-year crusade to liberate the people from Imperial Spanish rule.\" After the Battle of Las Piedras on 18 May 1811, Artigas was named \"Chief of the Orientales\". After 1820, Artigas was forced to live in exile in Paraguay but his movement had been very successful and led to the establishment of the First Republic of Uruguay on 25 August 1825.\n\nBefore the Independence of Uruguay Salto had acquired the category of \"Pueblo\" (village) and on 16 May 1835, by Decree, it was recognized as being a \"Villa\" (town). Then, on 16 June 1837, Salto was made capital of the department by the Act of Ley Nº 158.\n\nIn late October 1845 roughly 1,000 of Giuseppe Garibaldi's Italian and Uruguayan troops advanced up the Uruguay River and took Gualeguaychú in Argentina before seizing Salto, remaining there several months as they plotted against Justo José de Urquiza, Cesar Diaz and Servando Gomez. On 8 February 1846 Garibaldi defeated Gomez's army, killing several hundred at San Antonio Chico Creek outside Salto. Garibaldi lost about a hundred men in the battle. Montevideo accepted him as General on February 16 when news of his victory reached the city.\n\nOn 8 June 1863 Salto's status was elevated to \"Ciudad\" (city) by the Act of Ley Nº 780, which was reaffirmed on 3 March 1869 by the Act of Ley Nº 1.000.\nDuring the late 2010s, Salto city saw a spate in criminal activity similar to those of other border cities across Latin America like Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, with drug trafficking and femicides among the principal crimes committed. According to Nicolas SantAnna, the president of the local commerce and industry syndicate, Salto's Don Atilio has become Uruguay's most dangerous barrio.\n\nIn 2011, Salto had a population of 104,028.\nSource: \"Instituto Nacional de Estadística de Uruguay\"\n\nAt the entrance of the city there is a memorial to the engineer Eladio Dieste. The memorial is formally called \"La Puerta de la Sabiduría\" (\"The Door of Wisdom\") and commonly known as \"La Gaviota\" (\"The Seagull\"). It was constructed by moving a structure built for station facilities and service by Leggiero Barbieri, a now-defunct trading firm. It is located at the intersection of Route 3 and Route 31 with Avenida Pascual Harriague, named after Pascual Harriague, who introduced grape cultivation in Uruguay. Salto is the site of a large number of works by Eladio Dieste, including an industrial warehouse/factory (Refrescos del Norte, 1978), an inn (north coast), a Municipal Bus Terminal, and a private bus company terminal (Turlit, 1980). Other prominent architects include J.P. Sanguinetti with his masterpiece \"El Campo y yo\".\n\nThe center of the city lies on Calle Uruguay, the heart of the business district, and many of the historic buildings in the immediate vicinity are significant. An apartment building called \"El Mirador\", the highest building in the city, opened in 2007. A museum of note is the Museo del Hombre y la Tecnología. There is a Plaza named after General Artigas in the central part of the city, containing a large statue of him. The largest park in the city is called the Parque Solari.\n\n\nPopular activities among young people include drinking mate (an herbal beverage), going dancing at night and crossing into Argentina to go shopping in Concordia on weekends. One of the attractions are the thermal pools located close to the city. They are kept at over 38 °C (100 F) around the year. Salto is also known for its street \"Calle Uruguay\", where locals stroll during weekend nights to socialize and drink mate with friends. Despite its many slum areas, Salto is considered one of the higher class areas of Uruguay for its various amenities that most of the country is lacking. The International Cultural Centre was founded in Salto in August 1990. The main football club is Salto Fútbol Club which plays in the Uruguayan Segunda División. Their home ground is located at the Estadio Ernesto Dickinson, which has a capacity of about 6,500.\n\nSalto was one of the host cities of the official 1967 Basketball World Cup.\n\nSalto lies at the junction of the north-south National Route 3 and east-west National Route 31 on the eastern bank at the beginning of the Lower Uruguay River, opposite the Argentine city of Concordia.

{"id": "2227854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227854", "title": "Siege of Fort St. Jean", "text": "Siege of Fort St. Jean\n\nThe Siege of Fort St. Jean (also called St. John, St. Johns, or St. John's) was conducted by American Brigadier General Richard Montgomery on the town and fort of Saint-Jean in the British province of Quebec during the American Revolutionary War. The siege lasted from September 17 to November 3, 1775.\n\nAfter several false starts in early September, the Continental Army established a siege around Fort St. Jean. Beset by illness, bad weather, and logistical problems, they established mortar batteries that were able to penetrate into the interior of the fort, but the defenders, who were well-supplied with munitions, but not food and other supplies, persisted in their defence, believing the siege would be broken by forces from Montreal under General Guy Carleton. On October 18, the nearby Fort Chambly fell, and on October 30, an attempt at relief by Carleton was thwarted. When word of this made its way to St. Jean's defenders, combined with a new battery opening fire on the fort, the fort's defenders capitulated, surrendering on November 3.\n\nThe fall of Fort St. Jean opened the way for the American army to march on Montreal, which fell without battle on November 13. General Carleton escaped from Montreal, and made his way to Quebec City to prepare its defences against an anticipated attack.\n\nFort Saint-Jean guarded the entry to the province of Quebec on the Richelieu River at the northern end of Lake Champlain. When Benedict Arnold and Ethan Allen captured Fort Ticonderoga and raided Fort St. Jean in May 1775, Quebec was garrisoned by about 600 regular troops, some of which were widely distributed throughout Quebec's large territory.\n\nThe invasion of Quebec began when about 1500 men, then under the command of General Philip Schuyler, arrived at the undefended Île-aux-Noix in the Richelieu River on September 4, 1775. On September 6, the Americans began making forays toward Fort St. Jean, only away. The army was initially composed of militia forces from New York and Connecticut, with most of its operation directed by Brigadier General Richard Montgomery, who took over complete command from Schuyler on September 16, when Schuyler became too ill to continue leading the invasion.\n\nFort St. Jean had been under preparations for an attack from the south ever since Arnold's raid on Fort St. Jean on May 18, in which he captured its small garrison and Lake Champlain's only large military ship. When news of that raid reached Montreal, 140 men under the command of Major Charles Preston were immediately dispatched to hold the fort. Another 50 Canadian militia were raised in Montreal on May 19, and were also sent to the fort.\n\nWhen Moses Hazen, the messenger bearing news of Arnold's raid, reached Quebec City and notified British Governor and General Guy Carleton of the raid, Carleton immediately dispatched additional troops from there and Trois-Rivières to St. Jean. Carleton himself went to Montreal on May 26 to oversee arrangements for the defense of the province, which he decided to concentrate on St. Jean, as it was the most likely invasion route.\n\nBy the time the Americans arrived at Île-aux-Noix, Fort St. Jean was defended by about 750 men under the command of Major Charles Preston. The majority of these were regular troops from the 7th and 26th Regiments of Foot and the Royal Artillery. There were 90 locally raised militia, and 20 members of Colonel Allen Maclean's Royal Highland Emigrants, men who were veterans of the French and Indian War. A detachment of Indians (probably Caughnawaga from a nearby village) patrolled outside the fort under the direction of Claude de Lorimier and Gilbert Tice. The Richelieu River was patrolled by an armed schooner, , under the command of Lieutenant William Hunter, with other boats under construction.\n\nThe fort itself, sited on the west bank of the Richelieu River, consisted of two earthen redoubts about apart, surrounded by a ditch wide and deep that was lined with chevaux de frise. The southern redoubt was roughly 250 by 200 feet (80 by 65 metres), and it contained 6 buildings, including a bake house, the fort's magazine, and storage houses. The northern redoubt was slightly larger, enclosing a two-storey stone house that was used as a barracks. The defenders had cleared brush for several hundred yards around the fort to ensure a clear field of fire. They had put up a wooden palisade to the west of the redoubts, and dug a trench connecting the two redoubts, for ease of communications. The eastern side of the fort faced the river, where there was a shipyard and anchorage for \"Royal Savage\".\n\nOn September 6, Generals Schuyler and Montgomery led a force of men in bateaux to a landing point about upriver from Fort St. Jean. Schuyler remained with the boats while Montgomery led some men into the swampy lands above the fort. There they were surprised by about 100 Indians led by Tice and Lorimier. In the ensuing skirmish, the Americans suffered 8 dead and 9 wounded, while the Indians suffered 4 dead and 5 wounded, with Tice among the wounded. The American troops, which were relatively untried militia forces, retreated to the boats, where they erected a breastwork for protection. The fort's defenders, seeing this, fired their cannon at the breastwork, prompting the Americans to retreat about upriver, where they set up a second breastwork and camped for the night. The Indians, resentful that neither the British forces in the fort nor the habitants had come to their support in the engagement, returned to their homes.\n\nAt this camp, Schuyler was visited by a local man, believed by some historians to be Moses Hazen. Hazen, a Massachusetts-born retired officer who lived near the fort, painted a bleak portrait of the American situation. He said that the fort was defended by the entire 26th regiment and 100 Indians, that it was well-stocked and ready for a siege. He also said that the habitants, while friendly to the American cause, were unlikely to help the Americans unless the prospects for victory looked good. Schuyler held a war council on September 7, in which the command decided to retreat back to Île-aux-Noix. However, on September 8, reinforcements arrived: another 800 men including Connecticut militia under David Wooster and New Yorkers with artillery, joined them. Heartened by this arrival, they decided instead to proceed with a nighttime attempt on the fort. Schuyler, whose illness was getting more severe (he was so ill \"as not to be able to hold the pen\"), turned command of the army over to Montgomery.\n\nReports of this first contact between opposing forces outside St. Jean were often wildly exaggerated, with many local reports claiming it as some kind of victory. The \"Quebec Gazette\", for example, reported that 60 Indians had driven off 1,500 Americans, killing 30 and wounding 40. Following this news, General Carleton issued orders for all of the nearby parishes to call up ten percent of their militia. Officers of the militia reported to Montreal, but many militia men stayed home. By September 7, a troop of about 120 men was raised, which was sent to Fort St. Jean.\n\nOn September 8, Schuyler sent Ethan Allen (acting as a volunteer since he had been deposed as head of the Green Mountain Boys by Seth Warner) and John Brown to circulate a proclamation announcing the Americans' arrival, and their desire to free the Canadians from the bondage of British rule. Allen and Brown traveled through the parishes between St. Jean and Montreal, where they were well-received, and even provided with local guards. James Livingston, a local grain merchant (and a relative of Montgomery's wife), began raising a local militia near Chambly, eventually gathering nearly 300 men.\n\nAllen also visited the village of the Caughnawaga, from whom he received assurances of their neutrality. The Caughnawaga had been the subject of a propaganda war, with Guy Johnson, the British Indian agent, trying to convince them (as well as other tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy) to take up arms against the Americans. However, Schuyler had successfully negotiated an agreement in August with most of the Iroquois to remain neutral. Word of this agreement reached the Caughnawaga on September 10; when Carleton and Johnson learned of it, Johnson sent Daniel Claus and Joseph Brant in an attempt to change the minds of the Caughnawaga; their entreaties were refused.\n\nOn the night of September 10, Montgomery led 1000 men out again, returning to the first landing site by boat. In the confusion of the darkness and the swamp, some of the troops were separated from the rest. When they encountered one another again, there was panic, as the each mistook the other for the enemy. After just 30 minutes in the swamp, they returned to the landing. Montgomery, who had stayed with the boats, sent the troops out again. This time, the vanguard encountered a few Indians and habitants, and again panicked. Two of the \"enemy\" were killed, but the troops again made a disorderly retreat to the landing, which their commander, Colonel Rudolphus Ritzema, was apparently unable to stop.\n\nWhile the command staff met to discuss the next move, word came in that the British warship \"Royal Savage\" was approaching. This started a disorganized retreat up the river back to Île-aux-Noix, in which the command staff was nearly left behind.\n\nA third attempt was planned for September 13; bad weather delayed attempts until September 16. However, General Schuyler was by this time so ill that he thought it necessary to withdraw to Ticonderoga. He left that day, turning full command of the invasion over to Montgomery. Schuyler was not the only one falling ill; the bad weather, and the swampy, malaria-infested terrain of Île-aux-Noix was also taking a toll on the troops, as more of them became ill as well. The bad news was tempered by good; an additional 250 troops, in the form of a company of Green Mountain Boys under Seth Warner, and another company of New Hampshire men under Colonel Timothy Bedel, arrived at Île-aux-Noix.\n\nOn September 17, Montgomery's army disembarked from their makeshift fleet just south of St. Jean, and sent out John Brown with a detachment to block the road going north from the fort to Montreal. A small flotilla of armed boats guarded the river against the possibility of \"Royal Savage\" attacking the army as it landed.\n\nBrown and his men made their first interdiction that day, capturing a wagon-train of supplies destined for the fort. Preston, seeing that this had happened, sent out a sortie to recover the goods. Brown's men, who had had time to hide the supplies in the woods, retreated until the sounds of the conflict reached the main body of the army. Montgomery, along with Bedel and his company, rushed to Brown's aid, and succeeded in driving the British back into the fort without recovering the supplies. During this encounter, Moses Hazen was first captured and questioned by Brown, and then arrested again by the British, and brought into the fort. That night, Hazen and Lorimier, the Indian agent, sneaked out of the fort and went to Montreal, to report the situation to Carleton.\nMontgomery began entrenching his troops around the fort on September 18, and constructing a mortar battery south of the fort. He ordered Brown to establish a position at La Prairie, one of the sites where there was a crossing of the Saint Lawrence River to Montreal. Ethan Allen went with a small company of Americans to collect Canadiens that Livingston had been recruiting, and take them to monitor Longueuil, the other major crossing point. Livingston had established a base at Point-Olivier, below Fort Chambly, another aging fort at the base of some rapids in the Richelieu River, and was urging his compatriots to join him there. Some Loyalists attempted to dissuade others from joining with Livingston; Livingston's supporters sometimes violently opposed attempts by Loyalists to organize, and Carleton did nothing at the time to assist the Loyalists outside the city.\n\nAllen, who was already renowned for his bravado in the action at Fort Ticonderoga, decided, when he reached Longueuil on September 24, to attempt the capture of Montreal. In the Battle of Longue-Pointe, this effort failed on the next day, with Allen and a number of men captured by the British. The alarm raised by Allen's proximity to Montreal resulted in the mustering of about 1,200 men from rural districts outside Montreal. Carleton failed to capitalize on this upwelling of Loyalist support by using them for a relief expedition against the besieging Americans. After several weeks of inaction by Carleton, the rural men drifted away, called by the demands of home and harvest. (Carleton did take advantage of the moment to order the arrest of Thomas Walker, a Montreal merchant who was openly pro-American and had been reporting to the Americans.)\n\nThe conditions for the Americans constructing the siege works were difficult. The ground was swampy, and the trenches quickly became filled knee-deep in water. Montgomery described his army as \"half-drowned rats crawling through a swamp\". To make matters even worse, food and ammunition supplies were running out, and the British showed no sign of giving in despite the American bombardment. Disease also worked to reduce the effectiveness of the Americans; by mid-October, more than 900 men had been sent back to Ticonderoga due to illness. In the early days of the siege, the fort's defenders took advantage of the land they had cleared around the fort to make life as difficult as possible for the besiegers erecting batteries. Major Preston wrote in his journal on September 23 that \"a deserter [tells us where] the enemy are erecting their battery and we distress them as much as we can with shells.\" Until large guns arrived from Ticonderoga, the fort's defenders enjoyed a significant advantage in firepower.\n\nOn October 6, a cannon that was dubbed the \"Old Sow\" arrived from Ticonderoga. Put in position the next day, it started lobbing shells at the fort. Montgomery then began planning the placement of a second battery. While he first wanted to place one to the northwest of the fort, his staff convinced him instead to place on the eastern shore of the Richelieu, where it would command the shipyard and \"Royal Savage\". This battery, whose construction was complicated by an armed row galley sent from the fort to oppose the works, was completed on October 13, and opened fire the next day. One day after that, \"Royal Savage\" lay in ruins before the fort. Its commander had, in anticipation of her destruction, ordered her to be anchored where her supplies and armaments might be recovered.\n\nJames Livingston had advanced to Montgomery the idea of taking Fort Chambly, near where his militia was encamped. One of Livingston's captains, Jeremy Duggan, had, on September 13, floated two nine-pound guns past St. Jean, and these guns were put to use to that end. Chambly, which was garrisoned by only 82 men, mostly from the 7th Foot, was surrendered on October 18 by its commander, Major Joseph Stopford, after two days of bombardment. Most seriously, Stopford failed to destroy supplies that were vitally useful to the Americans, primarily gunpowder, but also winter provisions. Six tons of powder, 6,500 musket cartridges, 125 muskets, 80 barrels of flour and 272 barrels of foodstuff were captured.\n\nTimothy Bedel negotiated a cease-fire with Major Preston so that the prisoners captured at Chambly could be floated up the river past St. Jean. The loss of Chambly had a dispiriting effect at St. Jean; some of the militia wanted to surrender, but Preston would not allow it. Following Chambly's capitulation, Montgomery renewed his intention to construct a battery northwest of St. Jean. This time, his staff raised no objections, and by the end of October guns that were emplaced there opened fire on the fort.\n\nIn Montreal, Carleton was finally prodded to move. Under constant criticism for failure to act sooner, and mistrustful of his militia forces, he developed a plan of attack. He sent word to Colonel Allan Maclean at Quebec to bring more of his Royal Highland Emigrants and some militia forces to Sorel, from where they would move up the Richelieu toward St. Jean, while Carleton would lead a force across the Saint Lawrence at Longueuil.\n\nMaclean raised a force of about 180 Emigrants, and a number of militia. By the time he reached Sorel on October 14, he had raised, in addition to the Emigrants, about 400 militia men, sometimes using threatening tactics to gain recruits. His and Carleton's hopes were dashed on October 30, when Carleton's attempted landing at Longueuil of a force numbering about 1,000 (mostly militia, with some Emigrants and Indian support) was repulsed by the Americans. A few of his boats were landed, but most were driven off by Seth Warner's use of field artillery that had been captured at Chambly.\n\nMaclean attempted to press forward, but his militia forces began to desert him, and the forces under Brown and Livingston were growing in number. He retreated back to Sorel, and made his way back to Quebec.\n\nIn late October, the American troop strength surged again with the arrival of 500 men from New York and Connecticut, including Brigadier General David Wooster. This news, combined with the new battery trained on the fort, news of the failed relief expedition, and dwindling supplies, made the situation in the fort quite grim.\nOn November 1, Montgomery sent a truce flag, carried by a prisoner captured during Carleton's aborted relief attempt, into the fort. The man delivered a letter, in which Montgomery, pointing out that relief was unlikely to come, offered to negotiate a surrender. Preston, not entirely trusting the man's report, sent out one of his captains to confer with Montgomery. The counteroffer, which Montgomery rejected, owing to the lateness of the season, was to hold a truce for four days, after which the garrison would surrender if no relief came. Montgomery let the captain examine another prisoner from Carleton's expedition, who confirmed what the first one had reported. Montgomery then repeated his demand for an immediate surrender, terms for which were drawn up the next day.\n\nPreston's troops marched out of the fort and surrendered their weapons on November 3, with the regulars in full dress uniform. He surrendered 536 officers and soldiers, 79 Canadien and 8 English volunteers.\n\nFollowing the news of St. Jean's surrender, Carleton immediately began preparing to leave Montreal. He left Montreal on November 11, two days before American troops entered the city without opposition. Narrowly escaping capture when his fleet was forced to surrender after being threatened by batteries at Sorel, he made his way to Quebec to prepare that city's defenses.\n\nCasualties on both sides during the siege were relatively light, but the Continental Army suffered a significant reduction in force due to illness throughout the siege. Furthermore, the long siege meant that the Continental Army had to move on Quebec City with winter setting in, and with many enlistments nearing expiration at year's end. Richard Montgomery was promoted to Major General on December 9, 1775, as a result of his successful capture of Saint Jean and Montreal. He never found out; the news did not reach the American camp outside Quebec before he died in the December 31 Battle of Quebec.\n\nIn 1776, the British reoccupied the fort following the Continental Army's abandonment of it during its retreat to Fort Ticonderoga.\n\nThe British (and then Canadian) military occupied the Fort Saint-Jean site until 1995, using it since 1952 as the campus of the Royal Military College, which still occupies part of the site. The site now includes a museum devoted to the 350-year military history of Fort Saint-Jean.\n\nSiege of Fort St. Jean is mentioned in a Fort Saint-Jean plaque erected in 1926 by Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada at the Royal Military College Saint-Jean. \"Constructed in 1743 by M. de Léry under orders from Governor la Galissonnière. This post was for all the military expeditions towards Lake Champlain.

{"id": "2227870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227870", "title": "Flight planning", "text": "Flight planning\n\nFlight planning is the process of producing a flight plan to describe a proposed aircraft flight. It involves two safety-critical aspects: fuel calculation, to ensure that the aircraft can safely reach the destination, and compliance with air traffic control requirements, to minimise the risk of midair collision. In addition, flight planners normally wish to minimise flight cost through the appropriate choice of route, height, and speed, and by loading the minimum necessary fuel on board. Air Traffic Services (ATS) use the completed flight plan for separation of aircraft in air traffic management services, including tracking and finding lost aircraft, during search and rescue (SAR) missions.\n\nFlight planning requires accurate weather forecasts so that fuel consumption calculations can account for the fuel consumption effects of head or tail winds and air temperature. Safety regulations require aircraft to carry fuel beyond the minimum needed to fly from origin to destination, allowing for unforeseen circumstances or for diversion to another airport if the planned destination becomes unavailable. Furthermore, under the supervision of air traffic control, aircraft flying in controlled airspace must follow predetermined routes known as airways (at least where they have been defined), even if such routes are not as economical as a more direct flight. Within these airways, aircraft must maintain flight levels, specified altitudes usually separated vertically by , depending on the route being flown and the direction of travel. When aircraft with only two engines are flying long distances across oceans, deserts, or other areas with no airports, they have to satisfy additional ETOPS safety rules to ensure they can reach some emergency airport if one engine fails.\n\nProducing an accurate optimised flight plan requires millions of calculations, so commercial flight planning systems make extensive use of computers (an approximate unoptimised flight plan can be produced using an E6B and a map in an hour or so, but more allowance must be made for unforeseen circumstances). When computer flight planning replaced manual flight planning for eastbound flights across the North Atlantic, the average fuel consumption was reduced by about per flight, and the average flight times were reduced by about 5 minutes per flight. Some commercial airlines have their own internal flight planning system, while others employ the services of external planners.\n\nA licensed flight dispatcher or flight operations officer is required by law to carry out flight planning and flight watch tasks in many commercial operating environments (e.g., US FAR §121, Canadian regulations). These regulations vary by country but more and more countries require their airline operators to employ such personnel.\n\nA flight planning system may need to produce more than one flight plan for a single flight:\n\nThe basic purpose of a flight planning system is to calculate how much trip fuel is needed in the air navigation process by an aircraft when flying from an origin airport to a destination airport. Aircraft must also carry some reserve fuel to allow for unforeseen circumstances, such as an inaccurate weather forecast, or air traffic control requiring an aircraft to fly at a lower-than-optimal altitude due to congestion, or the addition of last-minute passengers whose weight was not accounted for when the flight plan was prepared. The way in which reserve fuel is determined varies greatly, depending on airline and locality. The most common methods are:\n\nExcept for some US domestic flights, a flight plan normally has an alternate airport as well as a destination airport. The alternate airport is for use in case the destination airport becomes unusable while the flight is in progress (due to weather conditions, a strike, a crash, terrorist activity, etc.). This means that when the aircraft gets near the destination airport, it must still have enough alternate fuel and alternate reserve available to fly on to the alternate airport. Since the aircraft is not expected at the alternate airport, it must also have enough holding fuel to circle for a while (typically 30 minutes) near the alternate airport while a landing slot is found. United States domestic flights are not required to have sufficient fuel to proceed to an alternate airport when the weather at the destination is forecast to be better than ceilings and 3 statute miles of visibility; however, the 45-minute reserve at normal cruising speed still applies.\n\nIt is often considered a good idea to have the alternate some distance away from the destination (e.g., ) so that bad weather is unlikely to close both the destination and the alternate; distances of up to are not unknown. In some cases the destination airport may be so remote (e.g., a Pacific island) that there is no feasible alternate airport; in such a situation an airline may instead include enough fuel to circle for 2 hours near the destination, in the hope that the airport will become available again within that time.\n\nThere is often more than one possible route between two airports. Subject to safety requirements, commercial airlines generally wish to minimise costs by appropriate choice of route, speed, and height.\n\nVarious names are given to weights associated with an aircraft and/or the total weight of the aircraft at various stages.\n\n\nWhen twin-engine aircraft are flying across oceans, deserts, and the like, the route must be carefully planned so that the aircraft can always reach an airport, even if one engine fails. The applicable rules are known as ETOPS (ExTended range OPerationS). The general reliability of the particular type of aircraft and its engines and the maintenance quality of the airline are taken into account when specifying how long such an aircraft may fly with only one engine operating (typically 1–3 hours).\n\nFlight planning systems must be able to cope with aircraft flying below sea level, which will often result in a negative altitude. For example, Amsterdam Schiphol Airport has an elevation of −3 metres. The surface of the Dead Sea is 417 metres below sea level, so low-level flights in this vicinity can be well below sea level.\n\nFlight plans mix metric and non-metric units of measurement. The particular units used may vary by aircraft, airline, and location across a flight.\n\nSince 1979, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has recommended a unification of units of measurement within aviation based on the International System of Units (SI). Since 2010, ICAO recommends using:\n\n\nHowever, a termination date for completion of metrication has not been established. While SI units technically are preferred, various non-SI units are still in widespread use within commercial aviation:\n\n\nDistances are nearly always measured in nautical miles, as calculated at a height of , compensated for the fact that the earth is an oblate spheroid rather than a perfect sphere. Aviation charts always show distances as rounded to the nearest nautical mile, and these are the distances that are shown on a flight plan. Flight planning systems may need to use the unrounded values in their internal calculations for improved accuracy.\n\nFuel measurement will vary on the gauges fitted to a particular aircraft. The most common unit of fuel measurement is kilograms; other possible measures include pounds, UK gallons, US gallons, and litres. When fuel is measured by weight, the specific gravity of the fuel used is taken into account when checking tank capacity.\n\nThere has been at least one occasion on which an aircraft ran out of fuel due to an error in converting between kilograms and pounds. In this particular case the flight crew managed to glide to a nearby runway and land safely (the runway was one of two at a former airport then being used as a dragstrip).\n\nMany airlines request that fuel quantities be rounded to a multiple of 10 or 100 units. This can cause some interesting rounding problems, especially when subtotals are involved. Safety issues must also be considered when deciding whether to round up or down.\n\nThe altitude of an aircraft is based on the use of a pressure altimeter (see flight level for more detail). The heights quoted here are thus the nominal heights under standard conditions of temperature and pressure rather than the actual heights. All aircraft operating on flight levels calibrate altimeters to the same standard setting regardless of the actual sea level pressure, so little risk of collision arises.\n\nIn most areas, height is reported as a multiple of , i.e. A025 is nominally . When cruising at higher altitudes aircraft adopt flight levels (FLs). Flight levels are altitudes corrected and calibrated against the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA). These are expressed as a three-figure group e.g., FL320 is ISA.\n\nIn most areas, the vertical separation between aircraft is either .\n\nIn Russia, China and some neighbouring areas, altitudes are measured in metres. The vertical separation between aircraft is either 300 metres or 600 metres (about 1.6% less than 1,000 or 2,000 feet).\n\nUntil 1999, the vertical separation between aircraft flying at high altitudes on the same airway was . Since then there has been a phased introduction around the world of reduced vertical separation minimum (RVSM). This cuts the vertical separation to between flight levels 290 and 410 (the exact limits vary slightly from place to place). Since most jet aircraft operate between these heights, this measure effectively doubles the available airway capacity. To use RVSM, aircraft must have certified altimeters, and autopilots must meet more accurate standards.\n\nAircraft cruising at lower altitudes normally use knots as the primary speed unit, while aircraft that are higher (above Mach Crossover Altitude) normally use Mach number as the primary speed unit, though flight plans often include the equivalent speed in knots as well (the conversion includes allowance for temperature and height). In a flight plan, a Mach number of \"Point 82\" means that the aircraft is travelling at 0.820 (82%) of the speed of sound.\n\nThe widespread use of global positioning systems (GPS) allows cockpit navigation systems to provide air speed and ground speed more or less directly.\n\nAnother method of obtaining speed and position is the inertial navigation system (INS), which keeps track of a vehicle's acceleration using gyroscopes and linear accelerometers; this information can then be integrated in time to obtain speed and position, as long as the INS was properly calibrated before departure. INS has been present in civil aviation for a few decades and is mostly used in medium to large aircraft as the system is fairly complex.\n\nIf neither GPS or INS is used, the following steps are required to obtain speed information:\n\nThe weight of an aircraft is most commonly measured in kilograms, but may sometimes be measured in pounds, especially if the fuel gauges are calibrated in pounds or gallons. Many airlines request that weights be rounded to a multiple of 10 or 100 units. Great care is needed when rounding to ensure that physical constraints are not exceeded.\n\nWhen chatting informally about a flight plan, approximate weights of fuel and/or aircraft may be referred to in tons. This \"ton\" is generally either a metric tonne or a UK long ton, which differ by less than 2%, or a short ton, which is about 10% less.\n\nA route is a description of the path followed by an aircraft when flying between airports. Most commercial flights will travel from one airport to another, but private aircraft, commercial sightseeing tours, and military aircraft may do a circular or out-and-back trip and land at the same airport from which they took off.\n\nAircraft fly on airways under the direction of air traffic control. An airway has no physical existence, but can be thought of as a motorway in the sky. On an ordinary motorway, cars use different lanes to avoid collisions, while on an airway, aircraft fly at different flight levels to avoid collisions. One can often see planes passing directly above or below one's own. Charts showing airways are published and are usually updated every 4 weeks, coinciding with the AIRAC cycle. AIRAC (Aeronautical Information Regulation and Control) occurs every fourth Thursday, when every country publishes its changes, which are usually to airways.\n\nEach airway starts and finishes at a waypoint, and may contain some intermediate waypoints as well. Waypoints use five letters (e.g., PILOX), and those that double as non-directional beacons use three or two (TNN, WK). Airways may cross or join at a waypoint, so an aircraft can change from one airway to another at such points. A complete route between airports often uses several airways. Where there is no suitable airway between two waypoints, and using airways would result in a somewhat roundabout route, air traffic control may allow a direct waypoint-to-waypoint routing, which does not use an airway (often abbreviated in flight plans as \"DCT\").\n\nMost waypoints are classified as compulsory reporting points; that is, the pilot (or the onboard flight management system) reports the aircraft's position to air traffic control as the aircraft passes a waypoint. There are two main types of waypoints:\n\nNote that airways do not connect directly to airports.\nSpecial routes known as \"ocean tracks\" are used across some oceans, mainly in the Northern Hemisphere, to increase traffic capacity on busy routes. Unlike ordinary airways, which change infrequently, ocean tracks change twice a day, so as to take advantage of favourable winds. Flights going with the jet stream may be an hour shorter than those going against it. Ocean tracks may start and finish about 100 miles offshore at named waypoints, to which a number of airways connect. Tracks across northern oceans are suitable for east–west or west–east flights, which constitute the bulk of the traffic in these areas.\n\nThere are a number of ways of constructing a route. All scenarios using airways use SIDs and STARs for departure and arrival. Any mention of airways might include a very small number of \"direct\" segments to allow for situations when there are no convenient airway junctions. In some cases, political considerations may influence the choice of route (e.g., aircraft from one country cannot overfly some other country).\n\nEven in a free-flight area, air traffic control still requires a position report about once an hour. Flight planning systems organise this by inserting geographic waypoints at suitable intervals. For a jet aircraft, these intervals are 10 degrees of longitude for eastbound or westbound flights and 5 degrees of latitude for northbound or southbound flights. In free-flight areas, commercial aircraft normally follow a \"least-time-track\" so as to use as little time and fuel as possible. A great circle route would have the shortest ground distance, but is unlikely to have the shortest air distance, due to the effect of head or tail winds. A flight planning system may have to perform significant analysis to determine a good free-flight route.\n\nCalculation of fuel requirements (especially trip fuel and reserve fuel) is the most safety-critical aspect of flight planning. This calculation is somewhat complicated:\n\nFuel calculation must take many factors into account.\n\n\n\nThe weight of fuel forms a significant part of the total weight of an aircraft, so any fuel calculation must take into account the weight of any fuel not yet burned. Instead of trying to predict the fuel load not yet burned, a flight planning system can handle this situation by working backward along the route, starting at the alternate, going back to the destination, and then going back waypoint by waypoint to the origin.\n\nA more detailed outline of the calculation follows. Several (possibly many) iterations are usually required, either to calculate interdependent values such as reserve fuel and trip fuel, or to cope with situations where some physical constraint has been exceeded. In the latter case it is usually necessary to reduce the payload (less cargo or fewer passengers). Some flight planning systems use elaborate systems of approximate equations to simultaneously estimate all the changes required; this can greatly reduce the number of iterations needed.\n\nAn alternative approach to fuel calculation is to calculate alternate and holding fuel as above and obtain some estimate of the total trip fuel requirement, either based on previous experience with that route and aircraft type, or by using some approximate formula; neither method can take much account of weather. Calculation can then proceed forward along the route, waypoint by waypoint. On reaching the destination, the actual trip fuel can be compared with the estimated trip fuel, a better estimate made, and the calculation repeated as required.\n\nCommercial airlines generally wish to keep the cost of a flight as low as possible. There are three main factors that contribute to the cost:\n\nDifferent airlines have different views as to what constitutes a least-cost flight:\n\nFor any given route, a flight planning system can reduce cost by finding the most economical speed at any given altitude and by finding the best altitude(s) to use based on the predicted weather. Such local optimisation can be done on a waypoint-by-waypoint basis.\n\nCommercial airlines do not want an aircraft to change altitude too often (among other things, it may make it more difficult for the cabin crew to serve meals), so they often specify some minimum time between optimisation-related flight level changes. To cope with such requirements, a flight planning system must be capable of non-local altitude optimisation by simultaneously taking a number of waypoints into account, along with the fuel costs for any short climbs that may be required.\n\nWhen there is more than one possible route between the origin and destination airports, the task facing a flight planning system becomes more complicated, since it must now consider many routes in order to find the best available route. Many situations have tens or even hundreds of possible routes, and there are some situations with over 25,000 possible routes (e.g., London to New York with free-flight below the track system). The amount of calculation required to produce an accurate flight plan is so substantial that it is not feasible to examine every possible route in detail. A flight planning system must have some fast way of cutting the number of possibilities down to a manageable number before undertaking a detailed analysis.\n\nFrom an accountant's viewpoint, the provision of reserve fuel costs money (the fuel needed to carry the hopefully unused reserve fuel). Techniques known variously as \"reclear\", \"redispatch\", or \"decision point procedure\" have been developed, which can greatly reduce the amount of reserve fuel needed while still maintaining all required safety standards. These techniques are based on having some specified intermediate airport to which the flight can divert if necessary; in practice such diversions are rare. The use of such techniques can save several tons of fuel on long flights, or it can increase the payload carried by a similar amount.\n\nA reclear flight plan has two destinations. The \"final destination\" airport is where the flight is really going to, while the \"initial destination\" airport is where the flight will divert to if more fuel is used than expected during the early part of the flight. The waypoint at which the decision is made as to which destination to go to is called the \"reclear fix\" or \"decision point\". On reaching this waypoint, the flight crew make a comparison between actual and predicted fuel burn and check how much reserve fuel is available. If there is sufficient reserve fuel, then the flight can continue to the final destination airport; otherwise the aircraft must divert to the initial destination airport.\n\nThe initial destination is positioned so that less reserve fuel is needed for a flight from the origin to the initial destination than for a flight from the origin to the final destination. Under normal circumstances, little if any of the reserve fuel is actually used, so when the aircraft reaches the reclear fix it still has (almost) all the original reserve fuel on board, which is enough to cover the flight from the reclear fix to the final destination.\n\nThe idea of reclear flights was first published in \"Boeing Airliner\" (1977) by Boeing engineers David Arthur and Gary Rose. The original paper contains a lot of magic numbers relating to the optimum position of the reclear fix and so on. These numbers apply only to the specific type of aircraft considered, for a specific reserve percentage, and take no account of the effect of weather. The fuel savings due to reclear depend on three factors:\n\nDespite all the effort taken to optimise flight plans, there are certain circumstances in which it is advantageous to file suboptimal plans. In busy airspace with a number of competing aircraft, the optimum routes and preferred altitudes may be oversubscribed. This problem can be worse in busy periods, such as when everyone wants to arrive at an airport as soon as it opens for the day. If all the aircraft file optimal flight plans then to avoid overloading, air traffic control may refuse permission for some of the flight plans or delay the allocated takeoff slots. To avoid this a suboptimal flight plan can be filed, asking for an inefficiently low altitude or a longer, less congested route.\n\nOnce airborne, part of the pilot's job is to fly as efficiently as possible so he/she might then try to convince air traffic control to allow them to fly closer to the optimum route. This might involve requesting a higher flight level than in the plan or asking for a more direct routing. If the controller does not immediately agree, it may be possible to re-request occasionally until they relent. Alternatively, if there has been any bad weather reported in the area, a pilot might request a climb or turn to avoid weather.\n\nEven if the pilot does not manage to revert to the optimal route, the benefits of being allowed to fly may well outweigh the cost of the suboptimal route.\n\nAlthough VFR flights often do not require filing a flight plan (Source?), a certain amount of flight planning remains necessary. The captain has to make sure that there will be enough fuel on board for the trip and sufficient reserve fuel for unforeseen circumstances. Weight and centre of gravity must remain within their limits during the whole flight. The captain must prepare an alternate flight plan for when landing at the original destination is not possible.\n\nIn Canada, however, the regulations state that \"... no pilot-in-command shall operate an aircraft in VFR flight unless a VFR flight plan or a VFR flight itinerary has been filed, except where the flight is conducted within 25 NM of the departure aerodrome.\"\n\nOver and above the various cost-reduction measures mentioned above, flight planning systems may offer extra features to help attract and retain customers:\n\n\nFlight planning providers:\n"}

On 1 October 1884, it became capital of the newly formed Department of Rivera by the Act of Ley Nº 1.757.\n\nAlong the eastern borders of the department with Cerro Largo Department flows Río Negro, with its tributaries flowing through the easternmost part of the department. From north to south, these are: Arroyo San Luis, which forms part of its border with Brazil, Arroyo del Hospital with its tributary Arroyo Blanco and Arroyo Ceibal.\n\nThe western part of its southern border with Tacuarembó Department is formed by Río Tacuarembó, with its tributaries flowing through most of the department. From west to east, these are: Arroyo Rubio Chico, Arroyo Laureles which also forms part of the southern border of the department, Arroyo Cuñapirú with its tributaries Arroyo Batoví, Arroyo Mangueras, Arroyo de los Médanos, Arroyo Corrales and Arroyo Zapucay, Arroyo Yaguarí with its tributary Arroyo Carpintería, and Arroyo Caraguatá with its tributary Arroyo Coronilla.\n\nAt the northwest end of the department reaches the hill range Cuchilla de Haedo from the south turning into the Cuchilla Negra hill range, with the hill Cerro de los Peludos between them. Along the borders with Brazil, to the north, runs the hill range Cuchilla de Santa Ana. In the middle of the department is the hill Cerro de la Cruz, while on its eastern end are the hills Cerro del Hospital and Cerro Bonito.\n\nAs of the census of 2011, Rivera Department has a population of 103,493 (50.397 male and 53.096 female) and 39,859 households.\n\nDemographic data for Florida Department in 2010:\n\"2010 Data Source:\"\n\nRoute 5 joins Rivera, the capital of the department in the northwest, with Tranqueras and then with all the capitals of the departments to its south, Tacuarembó, Durazno, Florida and Canelones, reaching Montevideo from the west. Route 6 joins Vichadero, in the southeast of the department, with some important cities of the same departments to the south, including Sarandí del Yí and San Ramón, reaching Montevideo from the north. Between Rivera and Vichadero runs Route 27, while Route 30 joins Tranqueras with the city of Artigas to the northwest. Route 44, which marks part of the southern border of the department, connects with Melo to the southeast. Routes 28 and 29 connect the town Minas de Corrales with the other main Routes of the department.\n\nThe railroad track Montevideo-Rivera is active for cargo trains of the Línea Rivera, which connects with the railroad infrastructure of Brazil. A small length of this track, from Montevideo to Florida only, is also active for passenger trains.\n\nThe small airport of the city of Rivera receives light aircraft and an irregular service by a Brazilian airline to Porto Alegre.\n\n\n\n"}

It was released on September 10, 1993, by Paisley Park Records and Warner Bros. Records. The album is a comprehensive three-disc set consisting of many of his hit singles and fan favorites.\n\nIn 1993, Prince wanted to release \"Goldnigga\", the debut album by his band The New Power Generation but Warner Bros. refused and instead decided to finally release the greatest hits collection they had wanted to release two years earlier when Prince instead got \"Diamonds and Pearls\" released.\n\nDiscs one and two were released separately, under the titles \"\" and \"\" respectively, but \"\" disc could only be obtained by purchasing the full set. The separate \"Hits\" discs and the full set were all released on the same day. Most of the songs (A-side and B-sides) on \"The Hits/The B-Sides\" are represented in their edited single form. Exceptions to this were \"Alphabet St.\", \"7\", \"Little Red Corvette\", \"Sexy MF\", \"Let's Go Crazy\", and \"Purple Rain\". This compilation marks the first time the single version of \"Kiss\" was made available on CD. The third disc of B-sides also featured the 7\" edits, with the exceptions of \"200 Balloons\", \"17 Days\", \"Gotta Stop (Messin' About)\", \"Horny Toad\", \"Irresistible Bitch\", \"I Love U in Me\", \"God\", and \"How Come U Don't Call Me Anymore?\" which were all original full-length recordings from the original singles.\n\nAmong the previously unreleased material was the rare live version of \"4 the Tears in Your Eyes\", only previously released in a 1985 TV broadcast for the Live Aid concerts. Also included was a live version of \"Nothing Compares 2 U\", recorded live January 27, 1992, at Paisley Park with The New Power Generation. The other four new tracks were outtakes. The oldest track was \"Power Fantastic\", a moody ballad once considered for the \"Dream Factory\" project of 1986. Another ballad, \"Pink Cashmere\", was broadcast before some of the Lovesexy World Tour shows, dating it back to 1988 originally for his abandoned \"Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic\" project. \"Peach\" and \"Pope\" were more recent, and both were played live during some 1993 after shows. \"Pope\" was actually in the short-lived musical ballet \"Glam Slam Ulysses\", which also spawned several songs later released on \"Come\" and \"The Gold Experience\". Live jams of \"Peach\" often extended into the title track of \"Chaos and Disorder\".\n\nWhile Prince had very little interest in the project, he insisted that his longtime manager Alan Leeds write the liner notes instead of \"Rolling Stone\" journalist Neal Karlen. According to Prince biographer Per Nilsen, the record company paid Prince to not get involved with the making of this compilation.\nIn the United States the album debuted at number 19 on the \"Billboard\" 200 the week of October 2, 1993 with more than 87,000 copies sold combining the two abbreviated versions, \"Hits 1\" and \"Hits 2\"; the last two debuted at numbers 46 and 55, respectively, the same week. The next week, the album dropped to number 32 on the chart. It was present on the chart for 18 weeks.\n\nThe week following Prince's death, the album sold 40,000 equivalent copies (24,000 in pure album sales) thus allowing the album to re-enter the \"Billboard\" 200 at number 6. The next week it sold 106,000 units and hit a new peak of number four on the chart. The album was certified platinum by the RIAA on September 14, 1993 for shipments of one million.\n\nAs of April 2016 \"Hits 1\" has sold 1,451,000 copies and \"Hits 2\" sold 1,738,000 units according to Nielsen SoundScan, combined, they sold over 3,189,000 copies in the United States.\n\nIn the United Kingdom the album debuted and peaked at number four the week of September 25, 1993, the next week it fell off to number twelve and remained on the chart for 18 weeks. \"Hits 1\" debuted and peaked at number five on September 25, 1993 while \"Hits 2\" opened at number six the same weeks and two weeks later it reached and peaked at number five. \"The Hits/The B Sides\" was certified gold by the BPI on July 22, 2013 denoting shipments of 100,000 units.\nAll songs performed by Prince, except where noted.\n"}

Rockwell and NASA thus retroactively re-designated the MPTA as MPTA-098, though it was never christened with a name.\n\nOn June 24, 1977, MPTA-098 was delivered by Rockwell International to the National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL), in Hancock County, Mississippi, where it was mated with the Main Propulsion Test Article External Tank (MPTA-ET), mounted in a launch orientation and used for static engine tests.\n\nOn July 2, 1979, MPTA-098 suffered major structural damage due to a fractured fuel valve on Space Shuttle Main Engine number 2002. The fracture allowed hydrogen to leak into the enclosed aft compartment, raising the pressure to beyond the structural capability of the heat shield supports, severely damaging the structure.\n\nAfter extensive repairs were completed, testing resumed in September, but on November 4, a high-pressure oxidizer turbopump failed 9.7 seconds into a scheduled 510-second test. Finally, on December 17, 1979, a complete static firing was accomplished that included all three Space Shuttle Main Engines running at up to 100 percent of rated thrust for 554 seconds, exceeding the predicted maximum time that the SSMEs would burn during an operational shuttle launch.\n\nThe preliminary flight certification (PFC) program, which would clear the way for the SSMEs to be flown aboard manned vehicles, began in early 1980. A number of setbacks, including an overheating high-pressure turbopump that shut down an engine 4.6 seconds into a 544-second test on April 16, 1980, in July, the burn-through of a hydrogen preburner cancelled a 581-second test after 105 seconds and the structural failure of a flight-rated nozzle shut down a November 1980 test after 20 seconds, slowed progress dramatically. These failures led to a number of critical changes to the SSMEs and their associated systems.\n\nIn June 1980, due to the number of changes in the SSME design since the SSME installation on \"Columbia\", the three flight-rated SSMEs (numbers 2005, 2006 and 2007) which had performed successful individual 520-second mission demonstration test firings on the NSTL SSME test stand in early 1979, were removed from OV-102, shipped to NSTL, and successfully recertified. The engines were then shipped back to Kennedy Space Center and reinstalled on \"Columbia.\"\nOn January 17, 1981, with less than three months remaining before the scheduled STS-1 launch date, MPTA-098 successfully demonstrated a 625-second firing that included simulated abort profiles, completing the final PFC test and allowing the SSME design to be fully certified for flight, clearing the way for the launch of STS-1 on April 12, 1981.\n\nFrom 1981 until 1988, the MPTA-098 and MPTA-ET remained \"in-situ\" on the NSTL test stand, unused. In late 1988, the Essex Corporation used the thrust structure of the MPTA as the basis for an engineering development model for the proposed Shuttle-C launch vehicle. The model was used by NASA and Boeing at Kennedy Space Center and the Marshall Space Flight Center to conduct fit-checks and manufacturing engineering studies. The Shuttle-C program was cancelled by the United States Congress in 1990 and the model was disassembled.\n\nThe Main Propulsion Test Article, without truss work, is on display at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center, Visitor Information Center for NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, alongside the MPTA-ET which is mounted under the refurbished \"Pathfinder\" orbiter simulator.\n\n\n\n"}

It is part of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. The school was founded by Calvin Brainerd Cady in 1880 as the Ann Arbor School of Music, and it was later incorporated into the University of Michigan with Cady joining the faculty.\n\nWith the exception of the Department of Dance, the School is located on the University of Michigan's North Campus, which is also home to the College of Engineering, the School of Information, and the Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning.\n\nThe school was founded in 1880. Administrators and Deans include Charles Sink, Earl V. Moore, James B. Wallace, Allen Britton, Paul Boylan, Karen Wolff (2000–05), Christopher Kendall (2005–15), Aaron Dworkin (2015-18), and David Gier (2018–present). The school was originally independent of the university.\n\nWell known alumni include playwright Arthur Miller, actors James Earl Jones, Gavin Creel, Darren Criss, David Alan Grier and Lucy Liu, musicians Jessye Norman, Yakov Kreizberg, Ashley Putnam, William Albright, George Crumb, Alexander Frey, Normand Lockwood, Cynthia Phelps, Colin Stetson, David Daniels, Chip Davis, and Michael Fabiano, as well as the pop star Madonna.\n\nSee also the list of list of University of Michigan arts alumni.\n\nThe University puts on more than a dozen main stage productions and concerts every year. Besides its main stage productions, the school also offers performance opportunities through studio productions and student-run groups.\n\nMain stage and studio productions staged by the university every year include:\n\nMusicians have the opportunity to perform in many ensembles in connection with the university. These include choral ensembles, orchestras, wind bands, historical music ensembles, jazz ensembles, electronic and new music ensembles, chamber music groups, and world music ensembles.\n\nThe school is home to one of the longest-established Javanese gamelan ensembles in the United States. This group of instruments, known formally as \"Kyai Telaga Madu\" (Venerable Lake of Honey), has been at the university since 1966, when its purchase was negotiated and organized by Bill Malm. From 1968 until 2002, the ensemble was under the direction of faculty ethnomusicologist Judith Becker. The ensemble is currently directed by Susan Walton.\n\nWind ensembles, under the University Bands, provide a central performance and training opportunity for students at the school. The wind ensembles provide a primary training opportunity for most instrumentalists at the school, who may audition to perform in one of the two top ensembles, the Symphony Band and Concert Band. The Michigan Marching Band is also a component of the University Bands and provides music and entertainment at university athletic events.\n\nStudents also receive training in large orchestral ensembles.\n\nStudent organizations through the university include:\n\nThe school's facilities are located in Ann Arbor, Michigan. On the University of Michigan north campus, these include the Earl V. Moore Building, the Stearns Building, the Walgreen Drama Center, and the Lurie Carillon. Specific north campus facilities include studios in the James and Anne Duderstadt Center, as well as the Arthur Miller Theater and the Stamps Auditorium (both in the Walgreen Drama Center). The Miller Theater is the only theater given permission by the estate of Arthur Miller to bear the playwright's name. On central campus, the school's facilities include Hill Auditorium, the Power Center, the Dance Building, and Burton Memorial Tower, which houses the Charles Baird Carillon. The university's south campus is home to William D. Revelli Hall, which houses offices and rehearsal space for the University of Michigan Marching Band.\n\nThe majority of the school's teaching spaces, faculty offices, and music library, are located in the Earl V. Moore Building. This building is named after a previous dean of the school, and was designed in a mid-century modern style by architect Eero Saarinen. Saarinen was commissioned to design the master plan for the University of Michigan's North Campus, he requested to design the music school building (now the Earl V. Moore Building).\n\nThe original scheme called for an L-shaped building and a circular concert hall. Completed in 1964, the result was a five-level pavilion with flanking wings. Saarinen envisioned a building in harmony with nature, and so designed the building to be built into a hill overlooking a pond. The brick-clad concrete structure has narrow vertical windows that contrast with the horizontal brick patterns, thought to represent the alternating colors of piano keys. The brick color is known as “Cranbrook Buff” for its reference to the color of the buildings on the campus of the Cranbrook Education Community. The style of this building has influenced almost all of the later construction on North Campus.\n\nThe building contains 2 rehearsal/concert halls, 45 performance teaching studios, 18 classrooms, 40 offices, a large library, 120 practice rooms, including 12 organ practice rooms, and other special facilities for piano, harp, harpsichord and percussion practice. The construction of this building allowed for the first increase in enrollment since 1946.\n\nDuring construction of the building, Saarinen was diagnosed with a brain tumor, but he was able to watch the progress of the building from his room at University Hospital.\n\nAccording to the financial report submitted by President Harlan Hatcher to the Board of Regents in 1966, the University of Michigan had the second academic music school in the United States, after the University of Indiana School of Music. The Ann Arbor campus and the University Division of the National Music Camp at Interlochen enrolled the largest summer music session in the U.S.\n\nOn October 30, 2012, University of Michigan President Mary Sue Coleman announced an $8-million gift from William K. Brehm and Delores S. Brehm, a major contribution toward the cost of renovating and expanding the Moore Building. Of the total cost, another $14 million is allocated from the university, with the remaining balance to come from additional fundraising, including a gift from Glenn E. Watkins, emeritus professor of musicology. Construction for the project commenced in early 2014 and was finished in the fall of 2015. The renovation, which cost 29.5 million and added 34,000 square feet, includes a rehearsal with the footprint of Hill Auditorium, revamping of the McIntosh Theater, a lecture hall, an entrance and lobby, and new practice and teaching rooms.\n\nThe School of Music, Theatre & Dance offers degrees from the bachelors to the doctoral level. Fifteen departments make up the School of Music, Theatre & Dance, each offering several degree programs. They include:\n\n\nMichigan Performance Outreach Workshop\n\nThe Gershwin Initiative\n\nUniversity of Michigan Javanese Gamelan\nEXCEL Program\n\n"}

A unit of George Mason University, the Institute for Advanced Study also serves as a center for doctoral education in neuroscience. Research at the Institute is funded by agencies such as the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense.\n\nThe Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study of George Mason University was chartered in 1990 as a result of a bequest from Shelley Krasnow, a long-time resident of the National Capital Area. The work of the Institute began in 1993 with a scientific conference, co-sponsored with The Santa Fe Institute (SFI) and hosted at George Mason University. This conference on \"The Mind, the Brain, and Complex Adaptive Systems\" brought together an unusual group of scientists including two Nobel laureates (Murray Gell-Mann and Herbert A. Simon) and produced new approaches to this frontier in addition to a book published by SFI. \nThese efforts set the Institute on the path of human cognition within the context of the intersection of neuroscience, cognitive psychology and computer sciences.\n\nThe Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study is home to a scientific community of 100 (many of them Ph.D.'s) most of whom are also either faculty or trainees at George Mason University. The range of their research on cognition spans from molecules to mind. The Institute is housed in a dedicated facility on the Fairfax Campus of George Mason which includes extensive wet-laboratories, computer labs, a 3T MRI human brain imaging center, a cellular imaging facility, as well as faculty offices and breakout space. Additional research space on the Fairfax campus houses the Institute's Center for Social Complexity.\n\nThe Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study is also an academic unit of George Mason University. It houses the department of Molecular Neuroscience, which plays a key role in the interdisciplinary neuroscience doctoral program.\n\nThe Institute hosted several events in the \"Decade of the Mind\" initiative, which urged the U.S. Congress to invest in understanding how mind emerges from brain.\n\nThe Institute has collaborated closely with the Janelia Farm Campus of Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Allen Institute for Brain Science and the National Institutes of Health to develop better methods of reconstructing neuronal architectures.\n\nResearchers at the Institute include neuroscientists, bio-engineers, computer scientists, and computational social scientists. The Institute's various research programs are conducted by three centers (described below) and multiple lab groups. Many of the programs focus on research that may lead to cures to some of the most devastating brain diseases.\n\nThe Center for Neural Informatics, Neural Structures, and Neural Plasticity (CN3) pursues fundamental breakthroughs in neuroscience by fostering neuroinformatic and computational approaches to neuroplasticity and neuroanatomy. By bringing together faculty expertise in these multiple disciplines, the Center provides opportunities for cross-training in neuroscience, psychology, and engineering, both at the graduate and postdoctoral levels. CN3 researchers investigate the relationship between brain structure, activity, and function from the subcellular to the network level, with a specific focus on the biophysical and biochemical mechanisms of learning and memory. In the long term, we seek to create large-scale, biologically plausible network models of entire portions of the mammalian brain, such as the hippocampus, to understand the neural circuits and cellular events underlying the expression, storage, and retrieval of associative memory.\n\nKrasnow scientists are using functional magnetic resonance imaging of the human brain to study human interactions within the context of free-markets. These studies allow, for the first time, the elucidation of a biological basis for economic decisions.\n\nScientific projects at the Center for Social Complexity Center for Social Complexity - Center for Social Complexity focus on investigating social systems and processes on multiple scales: groups, organizations, economies, societies, regions, international systems. Researchers use a variety of interdisciplinary tools, including multi-agent systems and agent-based models (including the MASON toolkit in Java), cellular automata and other social simulation methods, network and graph-theoretic models, GIS (geographic information systems), events data analysis, complexity-theoretic models and other advanced computational methods. The Center houses a specialized simulation environment (the Simulatorium), where faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate research assistants collaborate in a variety of projects. Conflict and cooperation, emergent economic systems, network dynamics, and long-term societal adaptation to environmental change are among the current lines of investigation. Funding for the Center is provided by grants from the US National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, and other agencies. (*see also: Department of Computational Social Science).

The series was directed by Tomoki Kyoda, with series composition by Dai Satō, character designs by Kenichi Yoshida and music by Naoki Satō. \"Eureka Seven\" tells the story of Renton Thurston and the outlaw group Gekkostate, his relationship with the enigmatic mecha pilot Eureka, and the mystery of the Coralians. The fifty episode series premiered in Japan on MBS between April 17, 2005 and April 2, 2006 and was subsequently licensed by Funimation in North America, Madman Entertainment in Australia and New Zealand and by Anime Limited in the United Kingdom for English home video releases.\n\nThe series spawned six manga adaptations, a light novel, three video games and a feature-length anime film which was released in Japan on April 25, 2009. One of the manga titled \"Eureka Seven: AO\" which was serialized in \"Shōnen Ace\" between January 2012 and October 2013, was further adapted into an anime series which aired twenty-four episodes in Japan between April 13 and November 20, 2012. \"Eureka Seven\" was well received by critics and earned several awards at numerous award shows in Japan, most notably the 2006 Tokyo International Anime Fair.\n\n\n\nThe series focuses on Renton Thurston, the fourteen-year-old son of Adrock Thurston, a military researcher who died saving the world. He lives what he considers a boring life with his grandfather in a boring town. He loves lifting, a sport similar to surfing but with trapar, a substance abundant throughout the air, as the medium. He dreams of joining the renegade group Gekkostate, led by his idol Holland Novak, a legendary lifter. \nAn opportunity to do so literally falls into his lap when a large mechanical robot, called the Nirvash type ZERO, and Eureka, its pilot and a member of Gekkostate, crash into Renton's room. Renton's grandfather orders him to deliver a special part to the Nirvash called the \"Amita Drive\", which releases the immense power dormant within the type ZERO called the \"Seven Swell Phenomenon\". Afterwards, Renton is invited to join Gekkostate, where he quickly discovers that the behind-the-scenes life of Gekkostate is hardly as glamorous or as interesting as printed in the glossy pages of their magazine, \"ray=out\". Only one thing makes it all worthwhile for him: the presence of Eureka, the mysterious pilot of the Nirvash. Renton, Eureka, and the Gekkostate embark on an adventure that will shape their future as well as the world's.\n\nThe series was made by Bones and co-produced by Bandai Entertainment. Bandai Entertainment provided the title and handled the creative aspects of the series. Bandai had originally proposed a mecha anime series to the animation studio Bones. The studio had initially rejected it, but later reversed its position because it had already planned to create an anime using mecha designs by Shoji Kawamori. With the appointment of director Tomoki Kyoda and writer Dai Satō, Bandai's proposal was more or less scrapped and the staff began work on their own series that would become \"Eureka Seven.\"\n\nWhile conceptualizing \"Eureka Seven\", Kyoda \"wanted something that reflected the music and the subculture of his generation—and a love story.\" As such the show contains several references from music of the 1980s and the 1990s, and almost all of the show's episodes are named after real songs, composed by both Japanese and foreign artists.\n\nThe director wished to design the series as one that would at first focus on the personal elements and conflicts of the characters, then subsequently move the framework into a broader scale and perspective. The series' two halves each have their own very clear focus that reflects this design choice.\n\nWith the premise of the surfer robots in mind, Satō interviewed several real-life surfers and came to conclusion that they are close to nature. From this perception, he envisioned the environmental thematic as central point of the story. He said \"I thought it might be an effective message for children, especially in Japan. It's pretty veiled. I didn't want to be preachy.\"\n\n\"Eureka Seven\" consists of fifty episodes which aired from April 17, 2005, to April 2, 2006, on the Mainichi Broadcasting System and Tokyo Broadcasting System networks.\n\n\"Eureka Seven\" was available for online viewing on the Adult Swim Fix, Adult Swim's online video service before its televised debut on the Adult Swim channel between April 15, 2006, and ended on April 28, 2007. Adult Swim traditionally cut down the opening and ending themes from each episode to fit the series to American television's time restraints, which resulted in the final episode's first airing having actual content cut from it as the episode originally had no theme song sequences; it was re-aired properly the following week. In Canada, \"Eureka Seven\" premiered on YTV's \"Bionix\" block on September 8, 2006.\n\nBandai Entertainment and its affiliates distributed the English version of \"Eureka Seven\". It was released in the United States and Canada by Bandai Visual USA, in the United Kingdom by Beez Entertainment, and in Australia by Madman Entertainment. The first translated Region 1 DVD volume of the series was released on April 25, 2006 in the US, while the European Region 2 version was released on September 25, 2006. The English version was produced by Bang Zoom! Entertainment in Burbank, California. Following the 2012 closure of Bandai Entertainment, Funimation acquired the rights to the TV series and re-released the series on Blu-ray and DVD in 2014. On January 6, 2014, Manga Entertainment had released the first half of the series. \n\nAn anime sequel titled \"Eureka Seven: AO\" began airing on April 12, 2012, and ended on November 20, 2012. There is a total of 24 episodes. It has been released in Japan on Blu-ray and DVD, along with an OVA titled \"The Flower Fields of Jungfrau\". On May 16, 2013, Funimation announced the official release date in English dub. The first twelve dubbed episodes were released on DVD/Blu-ray on August 13, 2013, and the rest of the series released on October 15, 2013.\n\n\"Eureka Seven\" uses ten pieces of theme music. The opening themes of \"Eureka Seven\" are \"Days\" by Flow (episodes 1-13), by Home Made Kazoku (episodes 14-26), , by Bivattchee (episodes 27–32, 34–39) and \"Sakura\" by Nirgilis (episodes 40–49). The ending themes are by Kozue Takada (episodes 1–13, 26), \"Fly Away\", by Asami Izawa (episodes 14–25), \"Tip Taps Tip\", by Halcali (episodes 27–39) and \"Canvas\", by Coolon (episodes 40–49). The two insert songs are \"Storywriter\", by Supercar and , by Denki Groove (episode 50).\n\nThe soundtrack music is available on three different albums composed by Naoki Satō and a variety of other artists who composed insert songs used in the series. The first and second soundtrack albums were released on November 2, 2005 and April 5, 2006 respectively. The third soundtrack, titled \"Eureka Seven: Complete Best\" include the full-length versions of the opening and ending themes for both the series and game, as well as the insert song for the final episode.\n\nThe anime adaptation of \"Eureka Seven: AO\" uses six pieces of theme music. For the 13 first episodes, the opening theme is \"Escape\" performed by Hemenway and the ending theme is \"stand by me\" by Stereopony. Starting with episode 14, the opening theme changes to performed by FLOW and the ending theme changes to performed by joy. The two insert songs are \"Parallel Sign\" and \"Seven Swell\", both performed by LAMA.\n\nA manga adaptation of the original anime was created by Jinsei Kataoka and Kazuma Kondou. The manga was published by Kadokawa Shoten and began serialization in \"Monthly Shōnen Ace\" from the March 2005 issue and ended in the January 2007 issue, with a total of 23 chapters. The chapters were later compiled into six volumes. A second manga titled by Miki Kizuki, features the protagonists of the video games \"\" and \"\". It was published by Kadokawa Shoten and serialized in \"Comptiq\" magazine. Two volumes were released in Japan on November 7, 2011 and September 26, 2006 respectively. A manga adapting a proposed alternative ending of the series, titled \"Psalms of Planets Eureka Seven New Order\" was serialized in \"Comptiq\" by Kadokawa Shoten between June 2012 and May 2013.\n\nOn December 22, 2011, Kadokawa Shoten's \"Monthly Shōnen Ace\" magazine announced that a sequel manga titled \"Eureka Seven: AO\" based on the sequel series would be launched in their January 2012 issue. It featured an original story by Bones and was illustrated by Yūichi Katō. The manga began in January 2012, and concluded in October 2013, with a total of 21 chapters spanning over 5 volumes. A spin-off manga titled \"Eureka Seven AO - Save a Prayer\" began shortly after and focuses on a girl name Yuna and her two friends as they make their way from becoming trainees in Generation Bleu's Headquarters. A manga titled \"Eureka Seven nAnO\" was published as a 4koma and featured characters from the AO series.\n\nA light novel series written by Tomonori Sugihara and illustrated by Robin Kishiwada, was published by Kadokawa Shoten under their male oriented \"Sneaker Bunko\" label in 2005 and 2006. Bandai Entertainment released all four volumed in English between 2009 and 2011. A novelization of the Eureka Seven film \"Pocketful of Rainbows\" sharing the same name was also written by Tomonori Sugihara and illustrated by Hiroki Kazui and Seiji has also been released in Japan on May 1, 2009.\n\n\"Eureka Seven\" has three video games, all developed by Bandai or later Namco Bandai Games. The first to be released was , which was released in Japan on October 27, 2005, and in North America on October 24, 2006. The game features a different cast of characters and takes place two years before the anime. A sequel, , was released in Japan on May 11, 2006 and in North America on April 17, 2007. \"New Vision\" takes place two years after the events of \"New Wave\". Both games were released on the PlayStation 2 and feature the theme song \"Realize\", sung by Flow. A PlayStation Portable game sharing the same name of the anime, was released on April 6, 2006, in Japan. This game is based on the events from the first half of the show.\n\nA theatrical adaptation, , was first announced in the May 2008 issue of \"Newtype\"; it was publicly released on April 25, 2009, during Golden Week, with the animation production handled by Kinema Citrus. It contained a new mythos in an alternative universe, despite still featuring Renton and Eureka as the main characters, and confirming the events of the original series happened in a parallel world. \"Good Night, Sleep Tight, Young Lovers\" screened at select theaters nationwide in the US for a one night only special event on September 24, 2009 courtesy of Fathom Events. The movie also played at the Fantasia festival in Montreal on July 28, 2009. The main theme song for the film is \"Space Rock\", by iLL.\n\nA second three-part theatrical adaptation, , was announced on March 17, 2017. The film trilogy takes place before and during the events of the original series, as well as having an original story. The first movie was released on September 16, 2017. It shows the \"First Summer of Love\" phenomenon, previously only alluded to in the series and retells the \"Charles and Ray\" arc (mainly episodes 22-27) of the original. The second film, taking place in an alternative universe and focusing on Anemone, was released on November 10, 2018 under the title . The last film, titled was originally planned for release in 2019, but was delayed to 2021.\n\nAt Anime Boston, Masahiko Minami confirmed that the first film of the trilogy will premiere in Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand in Fall 2017, and that Funimation will distribute the film in the United States. Madman Entertainment will distribute the film in Australia and New Zealand. Anime Limited will distribute the film in the UK. Odex later announced they will distribute the film in Southeast Asian territories.\n\nTowards the end of its original Japanese run, \"Eureka Seven\" won multiple awards at the 2006 Tokyo International Anime Fair, including Best Television Series, Best Screenplay for Dai Satō, and Best Character Designs for Kenichi Yoshida. Yoshida, the series' main animator and character designer, also received an individual award at the 10th Animation Kobe Awards in September 2005. The series also won an award at the 20th Digital Content Grand Prix in Japan in January 2006. At the Anime Expo 2006 SPJA Awards, \"Eureka Seven\" won the award for Best Television Series, and Best Female Character for Eureka. \"Anime Insider\" voted it \"Best DVD Series of the Year\" in 2006. During a conference in 2010, writer Dai Satō claimed that many anime fans dismissed \"Eureka Seven\" as a clone of \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" without even watching it.\n\nThe sequel series, \"Eureka Seven: AO\", was met with mixed-to-negative reviews from fans and critics, who criticized the series for contradicting themes of \"Eureka Seven\". It was however awarded the jury selection prize by the 17th Japan Media Arts Festival Awards.\n\n\n \n"}

It was established in 1963 on the site of the small village of Obando, at the time in the municipality of San Felipe. The municipality was renamed in 1974. The municipal population of 31,514 (Census 2018) is mostly indigenous and accounts for about a third of the department's population.\n\nPrior to 1960 there was little development in the area, which was sparsely populated by almost entirely indigenous people. However, in the 1990s and 2000s, with increased exploitation of the area’s natural resources, efforts have been made to control the local population.\n\nLocated in the llanos at the confluence of the Inírida River and Guaviare River, most of the territory of the municipality of Puerto Inírida is river terrace and bottomland, although there are some hills. It is 30 km from the Venezuelan border.\n\nThe main economic activities in the municipality, aside from government, are agriculture, fishing and cattle raising. Agriculture includes subsistence farming, the production of fiber from the petioles of the young chiquichiqui palm (\"Bactris speciosa\"), used for rope, and the rattan known as \"Yaré\" used for furniture and baskets. \n\nTourists visit for several activities including fishing, canoeing, sightseeing and hiking. Hotels and hostels have appeared as national and international visitors continue to come. Handicrafts have now become a popular industry, and are supported by government institutions.\n\nThe society of Inírida is composed of 53% of indigenous people: Kurripacos, and . 30% are colonizers from the other parts of Colombia and 17% are other indigenous ethnic groups.\n\nThe local airport is César Gaviria Trujillo Airport , named in honor of a former Colombian president. As of 2007, its runway is serviced by two airlines, Satena, which has three flights a week to and from Bogotá and two flights a week to and from Villavicencio, and Air Colombia, which flies twice a week from the city of Villavicencio, through Barrancominas, Guainía and then arriving at Inírida. This airline operates a Douglas DC-3 which makes the trip an entire adventure. However, the San Fernando de Atabapo airport in Venezuela is just 30 km away. There is also a cargo airline that flies twice a week from Bogotà only. The airport was formerly known as \"Aeropuerto Obando\". \n\nIt is also possible to get to Inírida by the river, but the trip is long and costs almost the same as the flight. Traveling by the river it takes several hours, or even days, depending on the type of craft taken. \n\nWith the arrival of more and more people, a public transportation mechanism has been established. Around 500 auto rickshaws provide an efficient and inexpensive means of transportation. The standard fare (which covers almost all the destinations within the town) is around US $.50.

Called the \"Akoimetoi\" (\"Sleepless Ones\"), these monks prayed \"a monastic round of twenty-four offices to fill every hour.\" The inauguration of \"laus perennis\" at Agaunum circa 515 was the occasion of a solemn ceremony, and of a sermon by St. Avitus which survives. The \"custom of Agaunum\", as it came to be called, spread over Gaul, to Lyons, Châlons, the Abbey of Saint Denis, to Luxeuil, Saint-Germain at Paris, Saint Medard at Soissons, to Saint-Riquier, and was taken up by the monks of Remiremont Abbey and Laon Abbey, though the Abbey of Agaunum had ceased to practice it from the beginning of the ninth century.\n\nThe various Roman Catholic orders of nuns dedicated to the perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament may be seen as a modern variation on this theme, because in addition to the usual complete daily liturgical celebration of the Eucharist and Divine Office, these monastic communities also observe a perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, which usually involves having at least two members of the monastic community always being present in prayerful, silent contemplation of the Blessed Sacrament (i.e., a consecrated Host) exposed to view in a monstrance on the altar of the principal chapel. These monastic communities may themselves see their particular vocation as a part of a larger, more traditional monastic order, such as the Benedictine Sisters of Perpetual Adoration in Clyde, Missouri.\n\nThe first known Protestant continuous prayer was the \"Hourly Intercession\" of the Moravian Brethren in Herrnhut, Saxony. Beginning in 1727, the prayer continued 24 hours a day every day uninterrupted for over 100 years. The Moravian Unity began this continuous prayer vigil anew in 1957 as part of their 500th anniversary observance.\n\nToday, perpetual prayer is a common practice in many churches. Often the term 24-7 prayer is used to express that the prayer continues 24 hours 7 days a week. A notable example of current day perpetual prayer is the Jerusalem House of Prayer, International House of Prayer in Kansas City as well as other prayer houses such as the Justice House of Prayer that were inspired by this ministry. Many churches organize 24-7 prayer weeks that last for one or several weeks.\n\nAlso, many of the Cursillo, Walk to Emmaus and other similar Three Day and 4th Day Movements employ a similar \"laus perennis\" model \"during\" the actual retreats as 4th Day members who have already attended the events sign up for and maintain a continuous prayer clock throughout each retreat of each community with specific prayers for each new participant, or pilgrim.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2227976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227976", "title": "Arzew", "text": "Arzew\n\nArzew or Arzeu ( Berber; ) is a port city in Algeria, 25 miles (40 km) from Oran. It is the capital of Arzew District, Oran Province.\n\nLike the rest of North Africa, the site of modern-day Arzew was originally inhabited by the Berbers. Arzew's original Berber population came mainly from the nearby town of Bethioua, families from nearby Mostaganem, Kabyles that were deported there, as well as some semi-nomadic tribe called \"Hamian\".\n\nIt was named \"Arsenaria\", or \"Portus Magnus\" (Great Harbour) under the Roman Empire (the latter name is the one that can be seen in its former coat of arms). It has several Roman remains, mosaics, and artworks, which were removed to the museum of nearby Oran. During Roman times, Arzew's exports used to be grain and salt. The Vandals destroyed \"Portus Magnus\" in 429/430.\n\nSince the Muslim conquests, it regained some importance, as it was noted by the geographer \"El Bekri\", during his description of North Africa (1068) where he described the Roman ruins as \"Arzao\", an abandoned Roman port. The Almohads refounded the port in 1162. Under the Ziyanids, the port, located near the Ziyanid Tlemcen was renamed to Marsa Ben Zian (i.e. \"the port of the Zian tribe\").\n\nOn 10 July 1833, the French forces coming from Oran went further east and occupied the locality, which was then simply called \"Marsa\" (i.e. \"port\"). After years of war (ended by the Treaty of Desmichels) Arzew became a legal possession of France, with its name transliterated in Arabic as \"Arziou\" (Arziw) and in French as \"Arzowe\".\n\nKing Louis-Philippe ordered the creation of the settlement of \"Arzew Le Port\" on 12 August 1845, which encouraged people from Europe to settle the area. It became a fully functional commune on 31 December 1856. It was an important war site during World War II (see Operation Torch).\n\nDuring the Algerian War the city hosted one of the two SDECE French intelligence service s (\"counter-guerrilla and pacification instruction centre\").\n\nAfter the independence of Algeria in 1962, Arzew became an important port and industrial area, home to a refinery exporting LNG (liquified natural gas), as well as a fleet of small fishing boats to work the local waters.\n\nDuring the French colonial era, the settlers introduced a Roman Catholic celebration on August 15 -Assumption of Mary day- known as the \"Procession of the Virgin\" (\"la Procession de la Vierge\").\n\n\n"}

Before she can find the number, one of the Bringers appears behind her with a knife. She backs away to escape the cloaked figure and others like him until she hits a wall, but before the Bringers can attack, Buffy arrives and rescues the young Potential Slayer. Once Buffy disposes of the Bringers, Buffy welcomes the frightened woman, Rona, to Sunnydale. At the Summers house, Willow struggles to sleep on the floor of her room while Kennedy talks constantly from her spot on the bed. Kennedy talks about the luxurious life she had when she was younger, prompts Willow to do some magic and repeatedly attempts to get Willow to join her on the bed, making Willow uncomfortable.\n\nDownstairs, Molly tells several new Slayers-in-Training about the recently killed Anabelle. Xander suggests they be quiet and sleep, but a still-bound and very bored Andrew suggests they speak louder. Buffy arrives with Rona and the gang is updated on the recent activities and findings. The gang lacks answers to most of their current problems like destroying the Turok-Han and rescuing Spike from the First Evil. The Slayers in Training are worried and lacking confidence. Giles suggests they seek answers from an oracle-like creature known as Beljoxa's Eye. Down in the cave where he's kept prisoner, Spike is approached by one of the Bringers, but for once, he fights back and breaks free of the bonds that hold him to a wall. He runs through the tunnels and finds Buffy waiting for him, but quickly is pulled away from his dream and into reality where the First Evil, looking like Buffy, is waiting for him.\n\nGiles and Anya go together to meet with a demon, named Torg, about Beljoxa's Eye. After some careful persuasion, Torg opens up a dimensional portal for the both of them to pass through. On the other side, they find themselves in a dark, windy dimension and soon come face-to-face with a caged mass of eyes, the Beljoxa's Eye. Willow gets a call from a member of the Coven in England. Andrew is freed from his bonds and Buffy attempts to scare him by asking if he's ever seen \"Misery\", which Andrew starts comparing with the book before he realizes the implied threat. Willow informs Buffy about another potential Slayer in town and Buffy rushes off with Xander to pick the girl up before the Bringers do. As they leave, Dawn questions the usefulness of these potential slayers. The Slayers in Training work out in the basement of Buffy's house and thanks to some depressing comments from Eve, they talk about the seemingly insurmountable challenge they are facing and being called as a Slayer.\n\nBuffy and Xander knock at the room where the latest potential slayer is staying. When no one answers, Buffy kicks the door in and they find a dead blond girl lying on the ground. Upon closer inspection, they find that the girl is Eve and she's been dead for days. Back at the house, Andrew, still desperate to get on the Scoobies' good side, asks Dawn how he could be useful, but Dawn informs Andrew that Buffy gave her permission to kill him if he talks too much. Suddenly, Buffy and Xander return to the house and go down to the basement, where they tell \"Eve\" to get away from the others. The First in Eve's form finally reveals itself and with some thanks for all the information over the past few days and threatening comments about the future, then disappears. In the other dimension, Giles and Anya speak with the Beljoxa's Eye, which tells them that the First Evil cannot be destroyed and that its mission exists now because of a disruption in the Slayer's line, which was in fact, caused by the Slayer.\n\nThe gang, all worried after the frightening invasion by the First, talk about what they are going to do. Buffy tries to keep the potential Slayers calm, but they continue to worry about whether they are prepared to handle anything that lies before them. Buffy and Willow exchange glances and then both leave the dining room, followed by a confused Xander while the others continue to panic. Back in the cave, the First approaches the Turok-Han as Eve and sends him out to kill everyone except \"her.\" A crowd of Bringers forms outside Buffy's house that night, but do nothing but keep the Slayers from leaving. Buffy disperses weapons to the gang as they all wait for the expected attack of the Turok-Han. Willow practices some simple magic to see if the First would go after her again. Kennedy interrupts and is intrigued by Willow's skills and her past struggles with it. Willow warns her that the evil magic she's been exposed to in the past is not something Kennedy wants to see.\n\nThe Turok-Han charges at the house and breaks the front door down. Willow puts up a barrier that keeps the vampire at bay, but it's almost too much for Willow and Buffy instructs everyone to run out the back. The gang encounters Bringers in the backyard, but they are destroyed and the gang runs off as the Turok-Han finally breaks through Willow's magical barrier. Meanwhile, Anya and Giles return to their usual dimension and Giles explains that the disturbance in the Slayer line was Buffy's revival from death. Anya realizes that if they had never brought Buffy back to life, the First wouldn't be doing this to them now. The gang runs down the street together and then Buffy tells them to break up. Willow and Xander lead the potential slayers, as well as Dawn and Andrew to a safe location while Buffy turns and attacks the Turok-Han. After a brief struggle, Buffy runs and tries to get the vampire to follow her.\n\nXander leads the way through a construction site, which the potential Slayers find to be an extremely exposed and unsafe location for them hiding at. The Turok-Han appears, proving that it decided to go after the easier potential Slayers instead of Buffy. Kennedy prepares to attack the vampire, but then bright lights flood the site and Buffy appears as the potential Slayers move back to watch from a distance. Buffy tells the ubervamp that he's going to help her set an example for the other girls and begins a fight. A vicious battle ensues, but the ubervamp again proves to be stronger. As Dawn watches, she realizes aloud that Willow and Buffy planned everything as a teaching tool. A quick flashback to the panic-filled discussion at the house earlier shows that at the moment that Buffy, Willow and Xander left the others, the three were communicating telepathically about a plan to destroy the ubervamp and boost morale of the others at the same time.\n\nThe potential slayers begin to worry as Buffy ends up on the losing end of the fight, but Willow tells them to wait. Just in time, Buffy turns things around and strikes the ubervamp with a few harmful blows. Buffy finally grabs a wire to wrap around the vampire's neck and pulls until she beheads the creature, turning it to dust. The Turok-Han dusted, the bruised and blood splattered Buffy ends her lesson and leads the newly confident Slayers-in-Training back home. In the cave, Spike tries to tell off the First in Buffy's form as she stands before him with a knife in hand. Buffy cuts away his bonds as Spike wraps his arm around her, realizing it's not the First but the real Buffy. She helps the sobbing vampire out of the cave.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the capital city of the La Guajira Department. It has a sandy beach waterfront. \n\nFounded by conquistador Nikolaus Federmann in 1535, Riohacha was named after a local legend, \"The legend of the Axe\". Because of the powerful rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, the area is mostly desertic. It is inhabited primarily by Amerindians, predominantly the Wayuu ethnic group. During colonial times, Riohacha was a very important port, as divers could retrieve vast numbers of pearls from the harbor. \n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the city developed as one of Colombia's medium important, maritime commercial ports. It is also a multicultural center for La Guajira Department. The city is mentioned several times in novels written by Colombian writer Gabriel García Márquez, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Among his important works are \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\", \"Love in the Time of Cholera\", and \"Chronicle of a Death Foretold\".\n\nThe Riohacha area was long inhabited by American Indians of the Wayuu culture, part of the larger Arawak group. The first European to visit the area was the Spanish sailor Alonso de Ojeda in 1498, though he never landed. A short time later, Juan de la Cosa, another Spanish explorer, landed on what is today called Cabo de la Vela (Cape of the Sail, so called because of its shape). In 1535, the German explorer Nikolaus Federmann founded a city with the name \"Nuestra Señora Santa Maria de los Remedios del Cabo de la Vela\" (Our Lady Saint Mary of the Remedies of the Cape of the Sail) at the place where de la Cosa had landed.\n\nThe Spanish discovered a vast amount of pearls in the city's area This treasure frequently attracted raids by pirates. After the city was destroyed by a pirate raid, the city government relocated the city to the mouth of the Ranchería River, in order to confuse the pirates, and to give the city time to rebuild before the next attack. The new city, named \"Nuestra Señora de los Remedios del Río de la Hacha\" (Our Lady of the Remedies), expanded peacefully for a short time in its new location. Pirate attacks soon resumed. The next major attack, led by the famous English pirate Francis Drake, took place in 1569, when Drake pillaged the city searching for gold and pearls.\n\nIn the 18th century, Riohacha was incorporated to the Viceroyalty of New Granada as part of the province of Santa Marta. During the battles for independence from Spain, the port of Riohacha served many vessels fighting for Colombian and Venezuelan independence. Many Riohachans also served in the revolutionary navy, most notably Admiral José Prudencio Padilla, who would come to be considered a hero in the revolutions of Colombia and Venezuela.\n\nIn 1954, Riohacha City acquired municipality status, and in 1964 was declared capital of the new La Guajira Department.\n\n\nRiohacha has one airport, the Almirante Padilla Airport. It serves airlines covering the route to and from the Colombian capital city Bogotá, the near cities of Valledupar and Santa Marta, and the Caribbean resort island of Aruba. In September 2016 the low-cost carrier Easy Fly initiated service between Riohacha and Barranquilla.\n\nRiohacha, owing to the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, has a semi-arid climate (Köppen \"BSh\"), which owing to the extremely torrid temperatures is not that far above an arid climate despite receiving as much as of rainfall per year. This rain falls almost exclusively in May and between August and November, and for the rest of the year there are a mere thirteen wet days out of 212 in an average year. Despite the lack of rainfall, humidity is high year round and adds to the uncomfortable heat.\n\n"}

{"id": "2227992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227992", "title": "Mains hum", "text": "Mains hum\n\nMains hum, electric hum, or power line hum is a sound associated with alternating current which is twice the frequency of the mains electricity. The fundamental frequency of this sound is usually double of fundamental 50 Hz or 60 Hz, 100 Hz or 120 Hz depending on the local power-line frequency. The sound often has heavy harmonic content above 50–60 Hz. Because of the presence of mains current in mains-powered audio equipment as well as ubiquitous AC electromagnetic fields from nearby appliances and wiring, 50/60 Hz electrical noise can get into audio systems, and is heard as mains hum from their speakers. Mains hum may also be heard coming from powerful electric power grid equipment such as utility transformers, caused by mechanical vibrations induced by magnetostriction in magnetic core. Onboard aircraft (or spacecraft) the frequency heard is often higher pitched, due to the use of 400 Hz AC power in these settings because 400 Hz transformers are much smaller and lighter.\n\nElectric hum around transformers is caused by stray magnetic fields causing the enclosure and accessories to vibrate. Magnetostriction is a second source of vibration, in which the core iron changes shape minutely when exposed to magnetic fields. The intensity of the fields, and thus the \"hum\" intensity, is a function of the applied voltage. Because the magnetic flux density is strongest twice every electrical cycle, the fundamental \"hum\" frequency will be twice the electrical frequency. Additional harmonics above 100 Hz or 120 Hz will be caused by the non-linear behavior of most common magnetic materials.\n\nAround high-voltage power lines, hum may be produced by corona discharge.\n\nIn the realm of sound reinforcement (as in public address systems and loudspeakers), electric hum is often caused by induction. This hum is generated by oscillating electric currents induced in sensitive (high gain or high impedance) audio circuitry by the alternating electromagnetic fields emanating from nearby mains-powered devices like power transformers. The audible aspect of this sort of electric hum is produced by amplifiers and loudspeakers.\n\nThe other major source of hum in audio equipment is shared impedances; when a heavy current is flowing through a conductor (a ground trace) that a small-signal device is also connected to. All practical conductors will have a finite, if small, resistance, and the small resistance present means that devices using different points on the conductor as a ground reference will be at slightly different potentials. This hum is usually at the second harmonic of the power line frequency (100 Hz or 120 Hz), since the heavy ground currents are from AC to DC power supplies that rectify the mains waveform. See also ground loop.\n\nIn vacuum tube equipment, one potential source of hum is current leakage between the heaters and cathodes of the tubes. Another source is direct emission of electrons from the heater, or magnetic fields produced by the heater. Tubes for critical applications may have the heater circuit powered by direct current to prevent this source of hum.\n\nLeakage of analogue video signals can give rise to hum sounding very similar to mains hum.\n\nIt is often the case that electric hum at a venue is picked up via a ground loop. In this situation, an amplifier and a mixing desk are typically at some distance from one another. The chassis of each item is grounded via the mains earth pin, and is also connected along a different pathway via the conductor of a shielded cable. As these two pathways do not run alongside each other, an electrical circuit in the shape of a loop is formed. The same situation occurs between musical instrument amplifiers on stage and the mixing desk. To fix this, stage equipment often has a \"ground lift\" switch which breaks the loop. Another solution is to connect the source and destination through a 1:1 isolation transformer, called variously \"audio humbucker\" or \"iso coil\". Another extremely dangerous option is to break contact with the ground wire by using an AC ground lift adapter or by breaking the earth pin off the power plug used at the mixing deck. Depending on the design and layout of the audio equipment, lethal voltages between the (now isolated) ground at the mixing desk and earth ground can then develop. Any contact between the AC line live terminals and the equipment chassis will energize all the cable shields and interconnected equipment.\n\nHumbucking is a technique of introducing a small amount of line-frequency signal so as to cancel any hum introduced, or otherwise arrange to electrically cancel the effect of induced line frequency hum.\n\nHumbucking is a process in which \"hum\" that is causing objectionable artifacts, generally in audio or video systems, is reduced. In a humbucker electric guitar pickup or microphone, two coils are used instead of one; they are arranged in opposing polarity so that AC hum induced in the two coils will cancel, while still giving a signal for the movement of the guitar strings or diaphragm.\n\nIn certain vacuum-tube radio receivers, a winding on the dynamic speaker field coil was connected in series with the power supply to help cancel any residual hum.\n\nSome other common applications of this process are:\n\nAssuming a tempered scale with A=440 Hz, a 60 Hz tone is almost exactly halfway between A♯ (58.24 Hz) and B (61.68 Hz) two octaves below Middle C, and a 50 Hz tone is between G (49.04 Hz) and G♯ (51.93 Hz) two octaves below Middle C, but slightly flatter than the quarter-tone. These notes are within the range of a 4-string bass guitar.\n\nIn musical instruments, hum is usually treated as a nuisance, and various electrical modifications are made to eliminate it. For instance, humbucker pickups on electric guitars are designed to reduce hum. Sometimes hum is used creatively, for example in dub and glitch music.\n\nPower line hum can be alleviated using a band-stop filter.\n\nIn analog video, mains hum can be seen as hum bars, (bands of slightly different brightness) scrolling vertically up the screen. Broadcast television frame rates are chosen to match the line frequency, to minimize the disturbance these bars cause to the picture. A hum bar can be caused by a ground loop in cables carrying analog video signals, poor power supply smoothing, or magnetic interference with the cathode ray tube. \n\nElectrical network frequency (ENF) analysis is a forensic technique for validating audio recordings by comparing frequency changes in background mains hum in the recording with long-term high-precision historical records of mains frequency changes from a database. In effect the mains hum signal is treated as a time-dependent digital watermark that can be used to find when the recording was created, and to help to detect any edits in the sound recording.\n\n"}

It is played traditionally in elementary schools. \n\nTo start the game, seven or another number of individuals are selected and come to the front of the room. The teacher (or selected player) says, \"\"Heads down, thumbs up!\"\" or \"\"Heads down all around!\"\". The children who are not selected then put their heads down, and close their eyes. The chosen seven circulate through the room, secretly pressing down one thumb each and then returning to the front of the room. A variation is simply tapping the person. This part of the game takes about one minute. \n\nThe teacher/selected player then calls, \"\"Heads up, seven up!\"\" or \"\"Heads up, stand up!\"\" All children raise their heads and the children whose thumbs were pressed stand up. Each in turn names the person they think pressed their thumb or tapped their head. If they guess correctly, the guesser takes the place of the person who pressed their thumb at the front of the classroom, and the person who pressed their thumb returns to his or her seat. If the person whose thumb was pressed guessed incorrectly, he or she sits down.

This was the highest chart placement for any of the singles released from the 1978 solo albums. The album reached No. 26 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 album chart. It was certified platinum on October 2, 1978, and shipped over 1,000,000 copies. It is the highest selling of the four Kiss solo albums.\n\n\n\n"}

It is also the main city in the denominated \"Región Sabanas\" (Savannas Region), a subdivision of the Caribbean Region of Colombia, and the 23rd largest city by population in Colombia. It is located 30 kilometers from the Caribbean Sea by the Gulf of Morrosquillo, 125 kilometers from Cartagena, and 200 kilometers from Barranquilla.\n\nThe land comprising Sincelejo was inhabited in the Prehispanic age by several groups of indigenous people known as the Zenú. \n\nSincelejo was founded on October 4, 1535, the feast day of Francis of Assisi, with the name San Francisco de Asís de Sincelejo. The village used to be a part of Alonso Padilla's \"encomienda\" between 1610 and 1640, and was located on the site of a small Zenú indigenous settlement. At that time the indigenous people were overpowered and exploited by the Spanish colonizers, or encomenderos. \n\nOn November 21, 1775, Sincelejo was re-founded by the Spanish captain and engineer, Antonio de la Torre y Miranda, following orders from Cartagena's governor, Juan de Torrezar Díaz Pimienta. The construction of the town began with a church, the lands around it given to people who used to live sporadically across the region; this was to consolidate a religious and political center in the zone. Sincelejo was intended to follow the classical Spanish colonial grid, with the main church and its square in the center of the town, but this was not possible because of several creeks that ran through the town. \n\nIn 1812, Sincelejo became shelter for the revolutionary priests in \"La Rebelión de los Curas\" (the Priests' Insurrection).\n\nBy 1887, Sincelejo was one of the leading towns in the Province of Cartagena. In 1908 it became the short-lived capital of the department of Sincelejo, ultimately becoming part of the Province of Cartagena again in 1910. In 1912, Sincelejo almost disappeared because of a massive conflagration which dedstroyed most of the central zone; nevertheless the town was rebuilt. With the creation of the Sucre Department in 1966, Sincelejo subsequently became the capital.\n\nOn January 20, 1980, the Corralejas Stadium collapsed, killing at least 200 people.\n\nThe geography of Sincelejo is typical of mountain scenery, consisting of irregularly-shaped surfaces with variable slope and altitudes ranging from 50 to 260 meters. The weather is warm and dry, with average annual rainfall of 500–1200 mm.\n\nThe hilly landscape is the most defining feature of the town, extending from the mountains to the borders of the plateau in the north and south. Erosion is present in the rugged topography of rolling hills, which are moderately to strongly broken, with slopes between 7-50%.\n\nThe small mountain foothills in the municipality span from the marine fluvial plain in the west to the border shared with the town of Palmito. The terrain varies from flat to inclined.\n\n\nSincelejo is in the tropics, so its temperatures remain fairly constant throughout the year, with an average temperature of about 27 °C. It has a tropical wet and dry climate (\"Aw\") according to the Köppen climate classification.\n\nThe Drought season usually starts in the first or second half of December and extends until the end of February to the first half of March. The rainy season starts sporadically and gradually increases, peaking in April or May. In June and July, precipitation decreases (in a period called \"\"Veranillo de San Juan\"\") until it increases once more.\n\nSincelejo is subdivided into an urban zone and a rural zone. The urban zone is divided into 9 \"Comunas\" (townships), while the rural has 21 divisions named \"Corregimientos\".\n\nUrban Division\n\nRural Division\n\nIn 2018, Sincelejo had a population of 277,773. 83.7% of residential buildings are houses, while 12.1% are apartments; 98.1% of the housing has regular electricity; 83.7%, is connected to a sewage system; 79.7%, has a regular water supply; 79%, has natural gas and 50% has telephones. In Sincelejo, 51.6% of the residents are women, while 48.4% are men. The literacy rate is 87.5%. 11.5% of the citizens of Sincelejo recognize themselves as indigenous people, 3.4% as African-Colombians, and 85.1% recognize themselves as mestizos (mixed-race).\n\nThe main economic activities of the municipality of Sincelejo revolve around the area and neighboring department specifically in the livestock sector, agriculture, commerce, and other services. Because of the excellent quality, and breeding of is cattle, Sincelejo has been called the \"Capital Cebuísta de Colombia\". It has facilities for fattening herds. Dairy farming is done on a smaller scale but is an important contributor to the city's economy.\n\nAgriculture, is secondary to livestock farming, and is highlighted by the production of maize, cassava, yams, and bananas. Trade and other services, especially the government, are important economic activities in Sincelejo, supplementing the primary activities of the agricultural sector.\n\nIndustry is beginning to grow in the city with its new factories, including Postobón stands (drink stand), almidón (starch production), clothing, footwear, icopor (styrofoam), metal equipment, bricks, concrete, construction materials, and wood processing in particular, highlight the microenterprises in the municipality.\n\nThe economy of Sincelejo is sustained is sustained by: trade and services offered by banks, chain stores, clinics, restaurants, service stations, fixed and mobile telecommunications, road and air transport, automobiles, workshops. According to a recent census of the Industry and Commerce department, there are about 3000 establishments of all kinds of operating in the capital.\n\nThe traditional music of Sincelejo includes \"porro\" and \"fandango\" (similar to samba in Brazil). The typical dish of this city is \"mote de queso\" which is a soup with cheese. The city is known for its \"hamacas\" (hammocks) and the \"sombrero vueltiao\" (turned hat), which are both made by the native inhabitants. The \"sombrero vueltiao\" is also as a national symbol of Colombia. The city is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sincelejo.\n\nEvery January, Sincelejo opens the holiday for \"Fiestas del dulce nombre de Jesús\" (The party of the sweet name of Jesus) which takes place on January 20. The festival begins a few days earlier and includes a number of parades, a beauty contest, and several days of bullfighting within a temporary wooden circular structure similar to a stadium named \"Corraleja\". This is why the holiday is also called \"Las Fiestas de Corraleja\". On January 20, 1980, a combination of overcrowding and panic caused the bullring's wooden bleachers to collapse, killing 222 persons, although some estimates place the death toll at almost 400. This tragedy put traditional Corraleja on hiatus. In 1999 the municipality authorized the construction of the wooden structure renewing the bullfighting.\n\nThe \"Encuentro Nacional de Bandas\" (National Meeting of the Bands) also takes place in Sincelejo. This is a musical contest where folk bands perform the traditional musical styles of the Savanna Region: Porro and Fandango. The contest began in 1984 and takes place in the mid-year and it awards creativity and performance.\n\nAnother cultural yearly event in Sincelejo is \"Festival Sabanero del Accordeón\" (Savanna's Accordion Festival). Unlike the National Meeting of Bands, this festival is about the folk musical styles played on the accordion and it includes four styles: Paseo, Merengue, Son and Puya. The first winner of this contest was Lisandro Meza in 1974. The festival was created to show the Savanna's culture to the country and to the world. There is always some controversy when the styles of Valledupar, specially the paseo, win.\n\nSincelejo has several institutions devoted to cultural work such as \"La Escuela de Bellas Artes\" (School of Fine Art), Batuta among others.\n\nMajagual Plaza: Usually called \"La Placita de Majagual\" (The Little Plaza of Majagual), it has been referred to in several folk songs by artists such as Joe Arroyo. This plaza was the epicenter of the January 20 \"Corralejas\" for many years before it moved to La Plaza de Mochila where it took place until the disaster of 1980. Since then, Majagual Plaza was only used for activities related to sport., In 2007 it was relaunched with a new concept and post-modern design with an arch-shaped sculpture and a wide square for cultural events.\nSantander Park and Saint Francis of Assis Cathedral: As old as Sincelejo, the Santander Park was opened in 1776 and it was the first place where the January 20 \"Corralejas\" took place in 1845 running until 1964 when it was moved to Majagual Plaza. Just next to the park is the \"Catedral San Francisco de Asís\" (Saint Francis of Assis Cathedral), which was established in 1853. It is the center of the religious celebrations that take place throughout the year in Sincelejo such as: Easter, Virgin Mary, Sacred Heart and the most important celebration that takes place on January 20 - \"Las Fiestas del Dulce Nombre de Jesús\" (The party of the sweet name of Jesus).\n\nSincelejo's Municipality Theater: It was established in 1997 and it is a beautiful facility where concerts, musicals, folk events and theater operas take place. It is the cultural facility for excellence in Sincelejo.\n\nVIVA Sincelejo Shopping Center: The VIVA Sincelejo Shopping Center (\"Centro Comercial VIVA Sincelejo\") was opened in August 2006, as \"Saint Francisco Shopping Center\" (Centro Comercial San Francisco). It had a play ground for children, four movie theaters, and shops. It was located on Las Peñitas Avenue (\"Avenida Las Peñitas\"), the investment was about ten thousand million pesos.\n\nIn 2011 construction of a new mall in the same place began. The VIVA Sincelejo Shopping Center will have 91 shops where it is possible to find clothes, shoes, food and entertainment. The mall's area is about 31,000 square meters including parking space for 453 cars and 201 motorcycles. The very first stage of the mall was inaugurated in May 2013, the second one in August, and the third one in November. The total investment for this facility is twenty-five thousand million pesos (About 12.5 Million US Dollars). This mall holds the biggest shopping center in Sincelejo: Almacenes Exito.\n\nSincelejo is best known for its yearly folkloric and religious party - the 20th of January Party \"Fiestas del dulce nombre de Jesús\" (The party of the sweet name of Jesus) also known as Jesus' Sweet Name Party. This party includes a structure known as \"Corraleja\", which is a temporary crafty wooden bullring, where the main attraction is watching the bullfighters facing the bulls. There is no official remuneration for the bullfighters who dare to enter the ring, but usually the wealthiest landowners state an unofficial monetary incentive for those who stab the bull using small prickers. The picadors are also a part of the show, but they belong to cattle raising farms and they're paid for their work, but the unofficial incentive also applies for them.\n\nThe construction of the temporary bullring starts at the end of December, and civil engineers and architects supervise the work of dozens of workers. The bullfighting takes places in four or five journeys (a journey a day), usually including the weekend. Different cattle rising farms (previously chosen) are in charge of supplying the bulls - about 40 bulls per day - so at the end of the last day the most entertaining journey is chosen, with people's participation, and the cattle rising farm is awarded with an official incentive. A ticket to watch a bullfighting journey costs about 15-35 US Dollars and usually the last journey is the most expensive.\n\nThe main criticisms of the \"corraleja\" is the treatment of the animals, not only in the bullfighting but as it is being prepared, the safety of the usually unskilled bullfighters, and the consumption of alcohol within the bullring by watchers and bullfighters. Anyone who dares to join the bullfighters must have insurance, which is sold on site, so if they are hurt their medical costs are covered.\n\nTwo local dailies circulate in Sincelejo: \"El Meridiano de Sucre\" and \"El Universal Sincelejo\". There are also regional and national newspapers such as: \"El Tiempo\", \"El Espectador\" and \"El Heraldo\".\n\nThere are several radio stations. On the A.M. band there are Radio Caracolí, Radio Piragüa, Radio Chacury, Radio Sabanas, Radio Sincelejo, Ecos de la Sierra Flor and local stations of RCN Radio and Caracol Radio. On F.M. there are: Olimpica Stereo, Tropicana Stereo, Primavera Stereo, Bésame, 94.3 F.M., Marina Stereo and Unisucre FM Stereo, and Radio Tiempos.\n\nSincelejo receives five national television channels: RCN, Caracol, Canal Uno, Señal Colombia and Señal Institucional. There are two cable TV services: Claro and Cable Unión. Claro has the only local TV channel named Canal Doce (Channel 12) which is available for its subscribers. It includes several programs as well as a newscast devoted to Sincelejo and its zone of influence.\n\nSincelejo is known for being an important crossroads on the Colombian Caribbean coast. It is placed close to several important towns in the region - Montería, Magangué, Coveñas and San Marcos - and it is also relatively close to important cities in Colombia like Barranquilla, Cartagena, Valledupar and Medellín. There is regular transportation from Sincelejo to these cities by bus and taxi, with taxis being a little more expensive.\n\n15 kilometers away from Sincelejo is Las Brujas Airport where there are daily flights to the major cities of Bogotá and Medellín.\n\nAs the main city in Sucre and the Savannas Región, Sincelejo has a large number of students, with 35 public schools and several private schools. Also, there are several universities: Universidad de Sucre, which is the only public university in Sincelejo and Sucre. There are several private universities: CECAR, CORPOSUCRE, CUN, Universidad San Martín, Universidad Santo Tomás, Remington and there is a local office of the Universidad de Pamplona. There are several institutions offering technical and technological training the most important being the local facility of SENA.\n\n\n"}

It is a small town located in South eastern Colombia in the Amazon Basin. Founded in 1936, Mitú lies next to the Vaupés River at 180 meters above sea level. It is where the core of the services (transport and trade) are provided to the Vaupés Department.\n\nThe Vaupés River serves as connecting link between Mitú and nearby hamlets on the riverbanks, but there are no roads connecting the town to rest of the country. Accessible only by airplane, Mitú is the most isolated Capital of Department in Colombia.\n\nThe founding of Mitú can be traced to the rivalry between Brazilians and Colombians exploiting rubber in the basins and ranges of the upper Guainía and Apaporis rivers. By 1903 there was an intense activity exploiting rubber in the area around the Vaupés river using the local Indians, of the ethnic groups tucano and carijonas, as slaves.\n\nMitú was erected as a modest hamlet in October 1936 by Miguel Cuervo Araoz. The town served as a meeting point between different indigenous communities, in addition to being a center of rubber tree exploitation, fur trade and missionary center. Its main activity was the rubber trade for food, clothing and fuel. After being for a time a township, in 1963 Mitú became the capital of the Vaupés Commissary (Comisaria). In 1974, it was made municipality and in 1991 it became the capital of the new created department.\n\nIn November, 1998 an estimated 1,900 FARC guerrilla members of the Eastern Bloc of the FARC-EP tried to take over the town by force, against 120 National Police members and one Colombian National Army Battalion. The Colombian Air Force and Army Aviation supported ground forces with air raids. Mitú was left partially destroyed and some 60 policemen and 10 civilians died along with over 800 guerrilla members. In their escape FARC took hostages as human shields including some 40 to 45 members of the Colombian Military.\n\nOn June 13, 2010, two of the hostages captured in Mitú in 1998, National Police Col. (now Gen.) Luis Mendieta and National Police Col. Enrique Murillo were freed by the Colombian army in a rescue operation that also freed two others captured in Miraflores to the west in 1998.\n\n"}

{"id": "2228016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2228016", "title": "Association of ideas", "text": "Association of ideas\n\nAssociation of ideas, or mental association, is a process by which representations arise in consciousness, and also for a principle put forward by an important historical school of thinkers to account generally for the succession of mental phenomena. The term is now used mostly in the history of philosophy and of psychology. One idea was thought to follow another in consciousness if it were associated by some principle. The three commonly asserted principles of association were similarity, contiguity, and contrast, numerous others had been added by the nineteenth century. By the end of the nineteenth century physiological psychology was so altering the approach to this subject that much of the older associationist theory was rejected.\n\nEveryday observation of the association of one idea or memory with another gives a face validity to the notion. In addition, the notion of association between ideas and behavior gave some early impetus to behaviorist thinking. The core ideas of associationist thinking recur in some recent thought on cognition, especially consciousness.\n\nThe associationist theory is anticipated in Plato's \"Phaedo\", as part of the doctrine of anamnesis. The idea of Simmias is recalled by the picture of Simmias (similarity) and that of a friend by the sight of the lyre on which he played (contiguity). But Aristotle is credited with originating associationist thinking based on this passage:\n\nThe passage is obscure, but it indicates the principles known as contiguity, similarity, and contrast. Similar principles are stated by Zeno the Stoic, by Epicurus (see \"Diogenes Laertius\" vii. § 52, x. § 32), and by St Augustine of Hippo (\"Confessions\", x. c. 19). Aristotle's doctrine was expanded and illustrated during throughout the Middle Ages, and in some cases even into the 17th century. William Hamilton listed philosophical authorities who gave prominence to the general fact of mental association - the Spanish philosopher Ludovicus Vives (1492-1540) especially being exhaustive in his account of memory.\n\nIn Thomas Hobbes's psychology much importance is assigned to what he called, variously, the succession, sequence, series, consequence, coherence, train of imaginations or thoughts in mental discourse. But not before David Hume is there an express question as to what are the distinct principles of association. John Locke had, meanwhile, introduced the phrase \"association of ideas\" as the title of a supplementary chapter incorporated with the fourth edition of his \"Essay\", though with little or no suggestion of its general psychological import. Hume reduced the principles of association to three: similarity, contiguity in time and place, and cause and/or effect. Dugald Stewart suggested resemblance, contrariety, and vicinity in time and place, though he added, as another obvious principle, accidental coincidence in the sounds of words, and further noted three other cases of relation: cause and effect, means and end, and premise and conclusion, as connecting trains of thought under circumstances of special attention. Thomas Reid, made light of association, remarking that it seems to require only the power of habit to explain the spontaneous recurrence of trains of thinking, which become familiar by frequent repetition (\"Intellectual Powers\", p. 387).\n\nHamilton's own theory of mental reproduction, suggestion, or association is a development of his ideas in \"Lectures on Metaphysics\" (vol. ii. p. 223, seq.), which reduced the principles of association to simultaneity and affinity, and these further to one supreme principle of Redintegration or totality. In the final scheme he sets out four general laws of mental succession:\n\nThese special laws logically follow from the general laws above:\n\nThe \"Associationist School\" includes the English psychologists who aimed at explaining all mental acquisitions and the more complex mental processes generally under laws under the associations which their predecessors applied only to simple reproduction. Hamilton, though professing to deal with reproduction only, formulates a number of still more general laws of mental succession: law of Succession, law of Variation, law of Dependence, law of Relativity or Integration (involving law of Conditioned), and, finally, law of Intrinsic or Objective Relativity. These he posits as the highest to which human consciousness is subject, but it is in a sense quite different that the psychologists of the Associationist School intend their appropriation of the principle or principles commonly signalized. In this regard, as far as can be judged from imperfect records, they were anticipated to some extent by the experientialists of ancient times, both Stoic and Epicurean (cf. \"Diogenes Laertius\", as above).\n\nIn the period that led to modern philosophy, Hobbes was the first thinker of permanent note to whom this doctrine may be traced. Although he took a narrow view of the phenomena of mental succession, he (after dealing with trains of imagination or \"mental discourse\") sought in the higher departments of intellect to explain reasoning as a discourse in words, dependent upon an arbitrary system of marks, each associated with or standing for a variety of imaginations. Except for a general assertion that reasoning is a reckoning (otherwise, a compounding and resolving), he had no other account of knowledge to give. The whole emotional side of mind (\"the passions\") he similarly resolved into an expectation of consequences based on past experience of pleasures and pains of sense. Thus, though he made no serious attempt to justify his analysis in detail, he is undoubtedly to be classed with the associationists of the next century. They, however, were wont to trace their psychological theory no further back than to Locke's \"Essay\". Bishop Berkeley was driven to posit expressly a principle of suggestion or association in these terms:\n\n\"That one idea may suggest another to the mind, it will suffice that they have been observed to go together, without any demonstration of the necessity of their coexistence, or so much as knowing what it is that makes them so to coexist\".\" (\"New Theory of Vision\", § 25)\n\nand, to support the obvious application of the principle to the case of the sensations of sight and touch before him, he constantly urged that association of sound and sense of language which the later school has always put in the foreground, whether as illustrating the principle in general or in explanation of the supreme importance of language for knowledge. It was natural, then, that Hume, coming after Berkeley and assuming Berkeley's results (though he reverted to the larger inquiry of Locke), should be more explicit in his reference to association. But Hume was original also, when he spoke of it as a \"kind of attraction which in the mental world will be found to have as extraordinary effects as in the natural, and to show itself in as many and as various forms\".\" (\"Human Nature\", i. 1, § 4)\n\nOther inquirers about the same time conceived of association with this breadth of view, and set themselves to track, as psychologists, its effects in detail.\n\nDavid Hartley is the thinker most precisely identified with the Associationist School. In his \"Observations on Man\", published in 1749 (11 years after Hume's \"A Treatise of Human Nature\" and one year after the better known \"An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding\"), opened the path for all the investigations of like nature that have been so characteristic of English psychology. A physician by profession, he sought to combine with an elaborate theory of mental association a minutely detailed hypothesis as to the corresponding action of the nervous system, based upon the suggestion of a vibratory motion within the nerves thrown out by Isaac Newton in the last paragraph of the \"Principia\". So far, however, from promoting the acceptance of the psychological theory, this physical hypothesis proved to have rather the opposite effect, and it began to be dropped by Hartley's followers (as Joseph Priestley, in his abridged edition of the \"Observations\", 1775) before it was seriously impugned from without. When it is studied in the original, and not taken upon the report of hostile critics, who would not, or could not understand it, no little importance must still be accorded to the first attempt, not seldom a curiously felicitous one, to carry through that parallelism of the physical and psychical, which since then has come to count for more and more in the science of mind. Nor should it be forgotten that Hartley himself, for all his paternal interest in the doctrine of vibrations, was careful to keep separate from its fortunes the cause of his other doctrine of mental association. Of this the point lay in no mere restatement, with new precision, of a principle of coherence among \"ideas\" (which were also called by Hartley \"vestiges\", \"types\" and \"images\"), but in its being taken as a clue by which to follow the progressive development of the mind's powers. Holding that mental states could be scientifically understood only as they were analysed, Hartley sought for a principle of synthesis to explain the complexity exhibited not only in trains of representative images, but alike in the most involved combinations of reasonings and (as Berkeley had seen) in the apparently simple phenomena of objective perception, as well as in the varied play of the emotions, or, again, in the manifold conscious adjustments of the motor system. One principle appeared to him sufficient for all, running, as enunciated for the simplest case, thus:\n\n\"Any sensations A, B, C, etc., by being associated with one another a sufficient number of times, get such a power over the corresponding ideas a, b, c, etc., that any one of the sensations A, when impressed alone, shall be able to excite in the mind b, c, etc., the ideas of the rest.\"\n\nTo render the principle applicable in the cases where the associated elements are neither sensations nor simple ideas of sensations, Hartley's first care was to determine the conditions under which states other than these simplest ones have their rise in the mind, becoming the matter of ever higher and higher combinations. The principle itself supplied the key to the difficulty, when coupled with the notion, already implied in Berkeley's investigations, of a coalescence of simple ideas of sensation into one complex idea, which may cease to bear any obvious relation to its constituents. So far from being content, like Hobbes, to make a rough generalization to all mind from the phenomena of developed memory, as if these might be straightway assumed, Hartley made a point of referring them, in a subordinate place of their own, to his universal principle of mental synthesis. He expressly put forward the law of association, endued with such scope, as supplying what was wanting to Locke's doctrine in its more strictly psychological aspect, and thus marks by his work a distinct advance on the line of development of the experiential philosophy.\n\nThe new doctrine received warm support from some, as William Law and Priestley, who both, like Hume and Hartley himself, took the principle of association as having the like import for the science of mind that gravitation had acquired for the science of matter. The principle began also, if not always with direct reference to Hartley, yet, doubtless, owing to his impressive advocacy of it, to be applied systematically in special directions, as by Abraham Tucker (1768) to morals, and by Archibald Alison (1790) to aesthetics. Thomas Brown (d. 1820) subjected anew to discussion the question of theory. Hardly less unjust to Hartley than Reid or Stewart had been, and forward to proclaim all that was different in his own position, Brown must yet be ranked with the associationists before and after him for the prominence he assigned to the associative principle in sensory perception (what he called \"external affections of mind\"), and for his reference of all other mental states (\"internal affections\") to the two generic capacities or susceptibilities of Simple and Relative Suggestion. He preferred the word \"suggestion\" to \"association\", which seemed to him to imply some prior connecting process, for which there was no evidence in many of the most important cases of suggestion, nor even, strictly speaking, in the case of contiguity in time where the term seemed least inapplicable. According to him, all that could be assumed was a general constitutional tendency of the mind to exist successively in states that have certain relations to each other, of itself only, and without any external cause or any influence previous to that operating at the moment of the suggestion. Brown's chief contribution to the general doctrine of mental association, besides what he did for the theory of perception, was, perhaps, his analysis of voluntary reminiscence and constructive imagination, faculties that appear at first sight to lie altogether beyond the explanatory range of the principle. In James Mill's \"Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind\" (1829), the principle, much as Hartley had conceived it, was carried out, with characteristic consequence, over the psychological field. With a much enlarged and more varied conception of association, Alexander Bain reexecuted the general psychological task, while Herbert Spencer revised the doctrine from the new point of view of the evolution hypothesis. John Stuart Mill made only occasional excursions into the region of psychology proper, but sought, in his \"System of Logic\" (1843), to determine the conditions of objective truth from the point of view of the associationist theory, and, thus or otherwise being drawn into general philosophical discussion, spread wider than any one before him its repute.\n\nThe Associationist School was composed chiefly of British thinkers, but in France also it had distinguished representatives. Of these it will suffice to mention Condillac, who professed to explain all knowledge from the single principle of association (liaison) of ideas, operating through a previous association with signs, verbal or other. In Germany, before the time of Immanuel Kant, mental association was generally treated in the traditional manner, as by Christian Wolff.\n\nKant's inquiry into the foundations of knowledge, agreeing in its general purport with Locke's, however it differed in its critical procedure, brought him face to face with the newer doctrine that had been grafted on Locke's philosophy. To account for the fact of synthesis in cognition, in express opposition to associationism, as represented by Hume, was, in truth, his prime object, starting, as he did, from the assumption that there was in knowledge that which no mere association of experiences could explain.\n\nTo the extent, therefore, that his influence prevailed, all inquiries made by the English associationists were discounted in Germany. Notwithstanding, under the very shadow of his authority a corresponding, if not related, movement was initiated by Johann Friedrich Herbart. As peculiar and widely different from anything conceived by the associationists as Herbart's metaphysical opinions were, he was at one with them and at variance with Kant in assigning fundamental importance to the psychological investigation of the development of consciousness. Further, his conception of the laws determining the interaction and flow of mental presentations and representations, when taken in its bare psychological import, was essentially similar to theirs. In Friedrich Eduard Beneke's psychology also and in more recent inquiries conducted mainly by physiologists, mental association has been understood in its wider scope, as a general principle of explanation.\n\nThe associationists differ among themselves in the statement of their principle and, when they adduce several principles, in their conception of the relative importance of these.\n\n\nThe highest philosophical interest, as distinguished from that which is more strictly psychological, attaches to the mode of mental association called Inseparable. The coalescence of mental states noted by Hartley, as it had been assumed by Berkeley, was farther formulated by James Mill in these terms:\n\n\"Some ideas are by frequency and strength of association so closely combined that they cannot be separated; if one exists, the other exists along with it in spite of whatever effort we make to disjoin them.\" (\"Analysis of the Human Mind\", 2nd ed., vol. i, p. 93)\n\nJohn Stuart Mill's statement was more guarded and particular:\n\n\"When two phenomena have been very often experienced in conjunction, and have not, in any single instance, occurred separately either in experience or in thought, there is produced between them what has been called inseparable, or, less correctly, indissoluble, association; by which is not meant that the association must inevitably last to the end of life - that no subsequent experience or process of thought can possibly avail to dissolve it; but only that as long as no such experience or process of thought has taken place, the association is irresistible; it is impossible for us to think the one thing disjoined from the other.\" (\"Examination of Hamilton's Philosophy\", 2nd ed., p. 191)\n\nIt is chiefly by John Stuart Mill that the philosophical application of the principle has been made. The first and most obvious application is to so-called necessary truths, those that are not merely analytic judgments but involve a synthesis of distinct notions. Again, the same thinker sought to prove Inseparable Association the ground of belief in an external objective world. The former application, especially, is facilitated, when the experience through which the association is supposed to be constituted is understood as cumulative in the race, and transmissible as original endowment to individuals - endowment that may be expressed either, subjectively, as latent intelligence or, objectively, as fixed nervous connexions. Spencer, as suggested before, is the author of this extended view of mental association.\n\nIn the later part of the 19th century the associationist theory was subjected to searching criticism, and it was maintained by many writers that the laws are both unsatisfactorily expressed and insufficient to explain the facts. Among the most vigorous and comprehensive of these investigations is that of F. H. Bradley in his \"Principles of Logic\" (1883). Having admitted the psychological fact of mental association, he attacks the theories of Mill and Bain primarily on the ground that they purport to give an account of mental life as a whole, a metaphysical doctrine of existence. According to this doctrine, mental activity is ultimately reducible to particular feelings, impressions, ideas, which are disparate and unconnected, until chance Association brings them together. On this assumption, the laws of Association naturally emerge in the following form:\n\nThe fundamental objection to the law of Contiguity is that ideas and impressions, once experienced, do not recur; they are particular existences, and, as such, do not persevere to recur or be presented. So Mill is wrong in speaking of two impressions being \"frequently experienced.\" Bradley claims thus to reduce the law to\nThis statement is destructive of the title of the law, because it appears that what were contiguous (the impressions) are not associated, and what are associated (the ideas) were not contiguous; in other words, the association is not due to contiguity at all.\n\nProceeding to the law of Similarity (which in Mill's view is at the back of association by contiguity), and having made a similar criticism of its phrasing, Bradley maintains that it involves an even greater absurdity; if two ideas are to be recognized as similar, they must both be present in the mind; if one is to call up the other, one must be absent. To the obvious reply that the similarity is recognized ex post facto, and not while the former idea is being called up, Bradley replies simply that such a view reduces the law to the mere statement of a phenomenon and deprives it of any explanatory value, though he hardly makes it clear in what sense this necessarily invalidates the law from a psychological point of view. He further points out with greater force that in point of fact mere similarity is not the basis of ordinary cases of mental reproduction, inasmuch as in any given instance there is more difference than similarity between the ideas associated.\n\nBradley himself bases association on identity plus contiguity:\nor\nThis law he calls by the name \"redintegration\", understood, of course, in a sense different from that in which Hamilton used it. The radical difference between this law and those of Mill and Bain is that it deals not with particular units of thoughts but with universals or identity between individuals. In any example of such reproduction, the universal appears in a particular form which is more or less different from that in which it originally existed.\n\nF. H. Bradley's discussion deals with the subject purely from the metaphysical side, and the total result practically is that association occurs only between universals. From the point of view of empirical psychologists Bradley's results are open to the charge which he made against those who impugned his view of the law of similarity, namely that they are merely a statement - not in any real sense an explanation. The relation between the mental and the physical phenomena of association has occupied the attention of all the leading psychologists (see Psychology). William James holds that association is of \"objects\" not of \"ideas,\" is between \"things thought of\" - so far as the word stands for an effect. \"So far as it stands for a cause it is between processes in the brain.\" Dealing with the law of Contiguity he says that the \"most natural way of accounting for it is to conceive it as a result of the laws of habit in the nervous system; in other words to ascribe it to a physiological cause.\" Association thus results because when a nerve current has once passed by a given way, it will pass more easily by that way in future; and this fact is a physical fact. He further seeks to maintain the important deduction that the only primary or ultimate law of association is that of neural habit.\n\nThe objections to the associationist theory are summed up by George F. Stout (\"Analytic Psychol.\", vol. ii. pp. 47 seq.) under three heads. Of these the first is that the theory as stated, e.g., by Alexander Bain, lays far too much stress on the mere connexion of elements hitherto entirely separate; whereas, in fact, every new mental state or synthesis consists in the development or modification of a pre-existing state or psychic whole. Secondly, it is quite false to regard an association as merely an aggregate of disparate units; in fact, the form of the new idea is quite as important as the elements which it comprises. Thirdly, the phraseology used by the associationists seems to assume that the parts that go to form the whole retain their identity unimpaired; in fact, each part or element is ipso facto modified by the very fact of its entering into such combination.\n\nThe experimental methods in vogue in the early part of the 20th century to a large extent removed the discussion of the whole subject of association of ideas, depending in the case of the older writers on introspection, into a new sphere. In such a work as Edward B. Titchener's \"Experimental Psychology\" (1905), association was treated as a branch of the study of mental reactions, of which association reactions are one division.\n\nToday the field is studied by neuroscientists and artificial intelligence researchers as well as philosophers and psychologists.\n\n\nSee the works of Bradley, Stout, and James, above quoted, and general works on psychology; articles in Mind (passim);\n\n"}

Maybank was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada.\n\nThe son of John Maybank and Marion Bates, Maybank was born in London, Ontario. He served in the Royal Flying Corps during World War I. He was educated at the University of Manitoba, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree (1919) and a law degree (1922). He was called to the Manitoba bar in 1923. In 1927, Maybank married Dora Boys.\n\nHe first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1927, in the Winnipeg constituency. At the time, Winnipeg elected ten members via a single transferable ballot. Maybank, running as a Liberal, finished seventeenth on the first count and was not elected.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1931, Maybank served as a member of Winnipeg city council.\n\nIn 1932, the governing Progressive Party of Manitoba formed an electoral alliance with the Liberal Party, and government members subsequently became known as Liberal-Progressives. Maybank again ran in Manitoba, finished tenth on the first count, and narrowly won election for the final seat. On the final count, he defeated Leslie Morris by 309 votes for tenth place. Had Morris been elected, he would have been the first Communist to serve in a provincial legislature in Canada.\n\nFor the next three years, Maybank served as a backbench supporter of John Bracken's government. He resigned his seat on October 1, 1935, to run for the Canadian House of Commons in the 1935 federal election. He elected for the riding of Winnipeg South Centre, defeated Conservative candidate William Walker Kennedy and Cooperative Commonwealth Federation candidate Stanley Knowles. The Liberal Party won this election, and Maybank served as a backbench supporter of William Lyon Mackenzie King's government.\n\nMaybank defeated Kennedy a second time in the 1940 election, and defeated future Manitoba Cooperative Commonwealth Federation leader Lloyd Stinson by 3,996 votes in the 1945 election.

{"id": "2228057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2228057", "title": "Armatoloi", "text": "Armatoloi\n\nArmatoloi (Greek \"plural\" Αρματολοί; \"singular\" Armatolos, Αρματολός; also called Armatoles in English) were Christian Greek irregular soldiers, or militia, commissioned by the Ottomans to enforce the Sultan's authority within an administrative district called an Armatoliki (Greek \"singular\" Αρματολίκι; \"plural\" Armatolikia, Αρματολίκια). Armatolikia were created in areas of Greece that had high levels of brigandage (i.e. klephts), or in regions that were difficult for Ottoman authorities to govern due to the inaccessible terrain, such as the Agrafa mountains of Thessaly, where the first armatoliki was established in the 15th century. Over time, the roles of the armatoloi and klephtes became blurred, with both reversing their roles and allegiances as the situation demanded, all the while maintaining the delicate status-quo with the Ottoman authorities.They were armed men who were enforcing the law according to their desires with the force of their guns, armata, since the authority of the Ottoman Empire was very limited in the areas that they were acting, as the Ottoman empire where the Armatoloi were present was a failed state.\n\nDuring the Greek War of Independence, the armatoloi, along with the klephts, formed the nucleus of the Greek fighting forces, and played a prominent part throughout its duration. Yannis Makriyannis referred to the armatoloi and klephts as the \"yeast of liberty\" (\"μαγιά της λευτεριάς\").\n\nThe word \"armatolos\" first appeared in the 15th century during Venetian times. It is derived from a medieval loan from Latin \"arma\" ('weapon'), probably via Greek αρματολόγος ('someone who deals with arms', 'an armed person') → αρματολόος → αρματολός. According to an older hypothesis, the development of the word may also have been influenced by a conflation with the similar-sounding αμαρτωλός (\"sinner\"; cf. \"hamartia\"), which may have been associated with the topic of armed bands through phrases such as \"αμαρτωλοί/αρματολοί και κλέφτες\" (meaning \"sinners and thieves\", but also \"armatoloi and klephts\"). Owing to the parallelism with \"αμαρτωλός\", the word was also sometimes spelled as \"αρματωλός\", with the letter omega.\n\nThe military/police organization of the \"armatoloi\", known as \"armatolismos\", has its origins in the Byzantine period of Greek history. Armatolismos was a type of feudalism where police and military functions were provided in exchange for titles of land. As an institution, the \"armatoloi\" first appear in Agrafa, Thessaly during the reign of Sultan Murad II (r. 1421–1451). From there, they spread to other parts of Greece except the Peloponnese.\n\nAdministrative districts known as \"armatolikia\" were created in areas of Greece that had high levels of brigandage (i.e. klephts), or in regions that were difficult for Ottoman authorities to govern due to the inaccessible terrain. An armatoliki was commanded by a \"kapetanios\" (from Italian \"capitano\" meaning captain), often a former klepht captain who had been hired by the governing Ottoman pasha to combat, or at least contain, brigand groups operating in the region. In most cases, the captain would have gained a level of notoriety as a klepht to force the Ottomans to give him amnesty and the privileges that came with an armatoliki. Therefore, it was not surprising that armatolos units were organised in very much the same way as the klephts, with a captain assisted by a lieutenant called a \"protopalikaro\", who was usually a kinsman, and the remaining force made up of \"armatoloi\". Many captains ran their armatolikia like their personal fiefdoms, exacting a heavy toll of extortion and violence on the local peasantry.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the \"armatoloi\" were organized based on a feudal system under which they maintained their military/police duties in exchange for titles of land. When the Ottomans conquered Greece in the 15th century, they established treaties with the armatoloi in order for them to maintain their military/police functions. The Ottomans would have units of armatoloi or kapetanioi (καπετάνιοι, captains) function as peace-keepers in territories near difficult terrain (i.e. mountain passes) or in areas where resistance to foreign rule entailed acts of theft by the klephts.\n\nThe armatoloi were mostly concentrated in Macedonia, Thessaly, Epirus, Acarnania, and Aetolia (specifically Agrafa). In the Peloponnese, armatolismos did not develop in the same manner as it did in Roumeli and Epirus. In the Peloponnese, the \"kapoi\" (κάποι) and the \"meintanides\" (μεϊντάνηδες) were similar to the armatoloi. If in certain regions, the institution of armatolismos was not implemented, the territories were divided into \"armatolikia\" (αρματολίκια) or \"protakta\" (προτάκτα). These territories extended from the Axios River (\"Αξιός\") to the Ambracian Gulf (\"Αμβρακικός\") and up to the Corinthian Gulf (\"Κορινθιακός\"). The kapetanioi would often have authority over these territories via inheritance/succession. A single kapetanio was at first forced to submit his authority to the pasha who controlled the periphery. Later, all kapetanioi were forced to submit to Dervedji pasha (\"Δερβετζή πασά\").\n\nDuring the 18th century, there were around seventeen armatolikia. Ten of them were located in Thessaly and the eastern regions of Central Greece, four of them in Epirus, Acarnania, and Aetolia, and three in Macedonia. Every kapetanio had his rank-and-file soldiers known as \"palikaria\" (παλικάρια, from ancient Greek \"pallix\") and section leaders among these palikaria were known as \"protopalikara\" (πρωτοπαλίκαρα). The palikaria would train with their weapons on a daily basis.\n\nThe main weapon the palikaria utilized was the \"kariofili\" (καριοφίλι). Marksmanship was the proverbial hallmark that defined the palikaria. They were also high mobile and capable at conducting ambushes. The palikaria were resilient toward thirst, hunger and even the painful difficulties in their encounters with the klephts.\n\nThe term \"klephtopolemos\" (\"κλεφτοπόλεμος\") was used to name the strategies/tactics that both the klephts and armatoloi utilized. These tactics are used today for unconventional military campaigns by small guerrilla groups. The armatoloi would conduct campaigns during nighttime. This strategy was known as \"going out to pagana\" (έβγαιναν στην παγάνα). The armatoloi would usually do this when the klephts were coming out of their dens. The armatoloi would defend themselves in improvised forts (called \"meterizia\"; \"μετερίζια\") against the guerrilla tactics utilized by the klephts (specifically known as \"klephtouria\"; κλεφτουριά). A general offensive campaign by the armatoloi was known as \"giourousi\" (γιουρούσι). During one of these campaigns, the armatoloi would make effective use of swords and warcries.\n\nFor the Ottomans, it became progressively more difficult for them to distinguish the armatoloi from the klephts. Both groups began to establish relations with one another under a common ethnic Greek rubric. This collaboration was also based on mutual sentiments against foreign conquerors. Since both groups were armed and possessed military experience, they helped Greeks become better warriors before the advent of the Greek Revolution of 1821.\n\nThe first recorded appearance of collaborations between armatoloi and klephts goes back to 1585 during the wars fought between the Venetians and the Ottomans. During this time, Theodoros Boua-Grivas incited an insurrection in Acarnania and Epirus with armatoloi Poulios Drakos and Malamos from Epirus. The Sublime Porte continued to have trust in armed groups such as the armatoloi up until 1684. During that year the armatoloi became carriers of nationalist ideas. Prominent armatoloi from the 17th century were Soumilas (Σουμίλας), Meintanis (Μεϊντάνης), Livinis (Λιβίνης), Kourmas (Κούρμας), the Balaorites (Βαλαωρίτες), etc. Though these individuals engaged in failed rebellions, their attempts became an inspiration for future armatoloi to follow.\n\nSince the 1770s, the Russian Empire tried to inspire a rebellion in Greece (see Orlov Revolt). During these attempts, many armatoloi took up arms. With the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence, (an insurrection in which Russia had, for once, no involvement as an instigator or agitator) a number of prominent armatoloi abandoned any allegiance to the Ottoman state and formed the nucleus of the Greek land forces. Among them were Odysseas Androutsos, Georgios Karaiskakis, Athanasios Diakos, and Markos Botsaris. There were armatoloi (such as Karaiskakis) that were initially employed by Ali Pasha, and of whom some fought with him against the Ottomans. In 1820, when Ali declared his territory’s withdrawal from Ottoman influence, he depended heavily on the Greek armatoloi to help him. Though Ali’s insurrection failed, this bold experiment did not weaken the ability of the armatoloi to fight for independence and contribute to the Greek Revolution.\n\nThere was also the Albanian armatoli, mostly a private militia of Christian Albanians, with privileges given by the Sultan in 1861. During the Austro-Turkish War (1716–1718), the militia caused trouble in Kavala resulting in it being abolished in 1721 by Ahmed III. \n\n\n"}

The company began making cars in 1919 and diversified into light commercial vehicles in 1924. For a few years in the early 1920s Bean outsold Austin and Morris.\n\nBean suffered financial difficulties and the steel-maker Hadfields Limited took it over in 1926. The launch of an under-developed new model in 1928 worsened sales, and the company stopped making cars in 1929. Hadfields continued Bean commercial vehicle production as \"Bean New Era\" until June 1931. In 1933 Hadfield re-launched the company as Beans Industries, making components for other motor vehicle manufacturers.\n\nAbsolom Harper founded the iron foundry A. Harper & Sons in Dudley in 1822. George Bean married Absolom's granddaughter and in 1901 became the company's principal shareholder. In 1907 George became company chairman and the name was changed to A. Harper & Sons & Bean.\nThe company had been a supplier of car parts and in 1911 the company installed drop hammers to increase production and in 1912 the company opened a new forging plant in Smethwick. At the same time George Bean served as Mayor of Dudley in 1908, 1911 and 1912.\n\nIn First World War Bean prospered from military contracts to supply shrapnel and shell cases to the government. The company's factories were expanded in order increase production. By 1916 Bean was making about 21,000 shells a week. After the war George Bean was knighted for his wartime service and his son Jack was made a CBE.\n\nAfter the war Bean needed a product to replace the gap left by the end of military contracts so Bean entered the increasingly active car market by becoming a car maker. The manufacturing rights for the pre-war Perry car were for sale so in January 1919 A. Harper & Sons & Bean bought them for £15,000, giving it a quick entry into the car market. It set up a new factory in Hurst Lane, Coseley, to make the chassis, which were then driven to Dudley where the company's Waddams Pool works built the bodies.\n\nThe first model had a 1795 cc four-cylinder engine linked to a separate three-speed gearbox. It was a revival of the pre-war Perry 11.9, and was rated at 11.9 RAC horsepower. The Bean 11.9 in chassis form initially cost £400, but this was reduced to £245. A four-seat open body was £80. Production of the model peaked at 80 a week in 1922; about 10,000 were made in total.\nThe proposals to form this group and issue its shares to the public were announced on 27 November 1919, during London's Olympia Motor Show, the first show since the Armistice.\n\nJack Harper Bean was managing director of the company and he visited America in order to buy the latest machinery for car-making. Bean became one of the first UK companies to adopt twin moving track assembly lines. Bean also wanted to form a consortium of manufacturers along the lines of the General Motors model. He brought together a group of companies including the vehicle makers Swift and Vulcan, the steel-maker Hadfields, and the Regent Carriage company and together they formed \"Harper Bean Limited\" in November 1919.\n\nHarper Bean Limited offered its shares for sale for which buyers would be required to pay £6 million though only £1.5 million would be offered to the public. The £6 million proceeds would be used to buy:\ntogether with Rushmores (1919) Limited, Jigs Limited, Regent Carriage Co Limited,\nGallay Radiator Co Limited, Aeromotor Components Limited and Alex Mosses Radiator Co Limited\n\nHarper Bean Limited would carry on the business of ironfounders, metalworkers and manufacturers and distributors of motor vehicles. \nAfter investment in the above companies the balance of the new capital would be used to:\nDistribution was intended to be carried out through British Motor Trading which belonged to the Automobile Association's Motor Union Insurance\nInitial plans called for annual production levels of 50,000 small cars together with 25,000 medium size cars and a further 25,000 lorries or commercial vehicles. Financial commentators noted the company's financial structure was \"rather complicated\".\n\nThe new company wanted to emulate the success of the Ford Model T and exhibited its first car at the 1919 Motor Show. Its initial models were two- and four-seat tourers and coupés with prices starting from £425. By early 1920 the company was making 80 chassis a week and Bean's Dudley plant could not produce enough bodies, so it ordered 2,000 bodies from Handley Page of Cricklewood. In 1920 2,000 Bean cars were made.\n\nBut prices and wages soared and the car industry had entered recession. The Harper Bean conglomerate disbanded and the company ran up debts of £475,000 to its suppliers. It stopped production in October 1920 and Jack Bean resigned from the company a month later.\n\nIn November 1921 Sir George Bean, Barclays Bank, the National Provincial Bank and Hadfields rescued the company with a huge sum by buying a controlling interest in A Harper, Sons & Bean and paid off its creditors. Production resumed early in 1922 and the company was making 100 cars a week by August.\n\nIn October 1923 the company launched a new and much improved model, the Bean 14, with a 2.3-litre engine and a four-speed gearbox. About 4,000 of all the variants were made up to 1929. The car sold well, particularly in Australia. In 1924 the company launched a smaller Bean 12 and also began making light commercial vehicles. Also in 1924 Sir George Bean died aged 68 and was succeeded as chairman by Major Augustus Clerke who had previously been managing director of Hadfields.\n\nBut A Harper, Sons & Bean was still short of money with debts of £1.8 million, mainly as a result of its restructuring in 1921. Hadfields again rescued the company, The same models were made but there were changes in management with Jack Bean leaving the company and moving to another Wolverhampton manufacturer, Guy Motors.\n\nFrom 1922 Bean supplied engines for a light car, the Ariel Nine, which was made in Coventry. It was a water-cooled side-valve flat twin engine with \"square\" dimensions of 85 mm bore and 85 mm stroke, giving it 997 cc displacement. However, the engine was vibratory and noisy, so in 1924 Ariel discontinued the model.\n\nBean launched a new model, the 18/50, with a 2.7-litre six-cylinder Meadows overhead valve engine. It was in production for only a year, in which time 500 were made. In chassis form it cost £365. Some Bean factories were sold with production concentrated at its Tipton site. From 1927 all cars were branded Hadfield-Beans, and the 14 was updated to become the 2300 cc 14/40, still using the Bean engine.\n\nIn November 1924, partly to maintain production volumes, Bean added a 20/25 cwt lorry to its range. It made commercial vehicles from then until 1931, concentrating on the lighter end of the market. The original truck was based on a Bean car, but in 1927 the company launched a larger model with a commercial chassis and a capacity of 30 cwt (about 1,500 kg). Unfortunately for Bean, Morris Commercial entered the market at the same time: intense competition drove most other competitors out of the UK market. Bean's finances suffered, despite ongoing funding from Hadfields.\nIn 1927 Hadfields made a number of changes to the Bean range. Production of the Bean 12 ended with about 3,000 built in total. The Bean 14 became the Long 14, and a Short 14 was introduced. This was a Bean 12 chassis, powered by a 14 engine. Hadfields discontinued Long 14 in 1928.\n\nIn 1928 Hadfield launched Hadfield-Bean 14/45, which severely damaged the company's reputation. It also offered a sporting variant, the 14/70. The new models were not properly tested and went on sale with a number of serious faults. This led to a significant drop in sales and Hadfields ended Bean car production in 1929. Commercial vehicle production continued until June 1931, when Bean stopped making vehicles and entered voluntary liquidation.\n\nHadfields relaunched Bean in 1933 as Beans Industries to make castings for the motor industry. The company became profitable again and in 1937 Beans Industries became a public company. In World War Two the company made truck engines and parts. Standard-Triumph took over Bean in 1956 and became part of Leyland Motors in 1960. In the 1980s the Margaret Thatcher in her third ministry broke up British Leyland and in 1988 Bean was bought by its management team. The team also bought Reliant, which failed in 1995 and forced Bean into receivership. A German company, Eisenwerk Bruhl, bought the Tipton factory and renamed it as Bruhl (UK). The owners sold it to the directors and it became Ferrotech, which was a major supplier to Ford and Perkins Engines. The order book almost doubled in twelve months but appalling mismanagement led to increasing and unsustainable losses, the company was put in administration and as the administrators could not sell it as a going concern the factory ceased production in August 2005 and closed within six months.\n\nAustralian adventurer Francis Birtles made a number of epic and record-breaking journeys in a two-seat Bean 14 HP called the \"Sundowner\". In September 1926 Birtles and co-driver Alec Barlow drove it from Darwin to Melbourne. The next month they drove it back in a record eight and a half days. Then from October 1927 to July 1928 Birtles drove the car solo from London to Melbourne.\n\nThe Coseley factory also made Captain George Eyston's world-land-speed-record car Thunderbolt, which took the record in 1937.\n\nThe Dudley factory still exists as part of an unconnected private business. The Coseley factory made automotive parts supplier until Ferrotech was forced to close it in 2005. It was demolished three years later. The newer part of the factory site in Coseley / Tipton that was built in Bean's years as a parts supplier was sold and demolished in 2003–04, and the land redeveloped for housing within a few months. One of the streets on this new estate, Thunderbolt Way, is named after Eyston's record-breaking car.\n\nOn moving to the Coseley site, Bean built a block of offices on Sedgley Road West on the Tipton side of the boundary with Coseley. Tipton Council bought them and opened them as their municipal offices on 7 March 1935, a use which lasted for the next 31 years until Tipton council was abolished and the bulk of the town was placed under control of West Bromwich Council. Dudley College used the building until 1993, since when it has since been used by a number of different ventures.\n\nThe residential street Bean Road (Dudley DY2) has long existed within of the Dudley factory, while Bean Road (Coseley) gives access to the former Coseley factory site, and the nearby Bean Drive is a cul-de-sac off Thunderbolt Way in Tipton.\n\nA 1927 Bean 14 coupé was in the Museum of Science and Industry, Birmingham until it closed in 1997. The car is now in Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery's Dollman Street store, which is only occasionally open to the public. The Black Country Living Museum has a 1926 20/25 HP truck as a static exhibit. The National Motor Museum, Beaulieu has a 1928 Short 14 car as a static exhibit. The Bredgar and Wormshill Light Railway in Kent has had a number of Bean vehicles, including a 1923 14 HP Open Tourer that is driven to historic vehicle events both in the UK and overseas. Francis Birtles' record-breaking Bean 14 \"Sundowner\" is in the National Museum of Australia. A number of Bean vehicles, most of them 12 HP and 14 HP cars, survive and are driven in private ownership. It is thought about 500 of the six cylindered 18-50 Beans were produced and today around 20 of those are thought to survive. Two are in the UK and a number in Australia.\n\n\n"}

The club has several divisions for different sports: football, basketball, swimming, gymnastics, badminton, shooting and taekwondo. Its biggest divisions are Knattspyrnudeild Keflavíkur (football) and Körfuknattleiksdeild Keflavíkur (basketball).\n\nKeflavík's basketball subdivision, Körfuknattleiksdeild Keflavíkur, is one of the most successful basketball clubs in Iceland with its men's and women's teams winning multiple titles over the years. The club also runs successful youth teams. The total number of titles won by the club is an Icelandic record, with around 200 national titles and cup wins in all age groups. The teams play their games at the TM Arena in Reykjanesbær.\n\nThe Keflavík men's basketball team has won the fourth most Icelandic championships with 9 titles. They currently play in Úrvalsdeild karla.\n\nKeflavík's women's basketball team is the most successful women's basketball team in Iceland with 16 national championship. They currently play in Úrvalsdeild kvenna and are the reigning national champions and cup champions.\n\nThe history of Keflavík ÍF is considered to have begun in 1929. Its history has been convoluted, with several changes in name and status.\n\nKeflavík Youth Club (Ungmennafélag Keflavíkur, UMFK) was founded on 29 September 1929 by 28 young people in the town of Keflavík. The club became a member of The Icelandic Youth Federation which had been established in 1907 as part of Iceland's drive for independence. The Keflavík Youth Club was a typical youth club of the era; forming teams in swimming and athletics, teaching physical education, putting on theatre productions and supporting various local causes. An important part of the Youth Federation was appreciation for the country and its people and the movement was especially active in rural areas and small towns.\n\nOn 12 July 1950 a second sports club was founded in Keflavík, the Keflavík Football Club (Knattspyrnufélag Keflavíkur, KFK). Despite its name, the club formed teams in football, handball and swimming.\n\nWith two major sports clubs in the small town of Keflavík it was felt that resources were being spread too thin. On March 18, 1956 a new club was formed, Keflavík Sports Federation (Íþróttabandalag Keflavíkur, ÍBK). Similar sports federations were formed in towns around Iceland. The idea behind them was that various groups and clubs could come together to represent the town in various sports, often against other towns. Another aim was to enable sportsmen from smaller towns to compete against the bigger clubs from Reykjavík, especially in football and other team sports. The town federations also represented the town's clubs within national associations. In Keflavík the existing clubs were not disbanded but their operations were limited. Keflavík Youth Club continued to work within the national youth movement, mainly on social and cultural issues. Sporting activities within the youth club and Keflavík Football Club were virtually non-existent, although the youth club participated in the semi-annual national youth festival. The two clubs also played against each other in team sports like football and handball on special occasions in the town, like Independence Day.\n\nIn 1994 the town of Keflavík merged with its neighbouring towns of Njarðvík and Hafnir to form a new municipality, Reykjanesbær. A new sports federation was formed for the new town, Reykjanesbær Sports Federation (Íþróttabandalag Reykjanesbæjar,ÍRB). With the Keflavík club no longer a sports federation it was decided to form a new club, Keflavík Sports and Youth Club (Keflavík, íþrótta- og ungmennafélag), which was to be commonly known as Keflavík. The youth in the title was to indicate that the club was a member of The Icelandic Youth Federation. The new club also became a member of The National Olympic and Sports Association of Iceland (Íþrótta- og Ólympíusamband Íslands, ÍSÍ) and Reykjanesbær Sports Federation.\n\n"}

It was one of the first clubs to replace some of the 'red light' businesses on South First Street (across the street was the Pussycat Theater which later became F/X). The Cactus Club took over The Bachelor Club and went on to become a legendary live music venue in San Jose for close to 15 years. The concept of The Cactus Club was created by Sean Galvin and Mike Trippett. It was Producer/Promoter Ric Hines who made the opening of the Cactus Club possible with his business experience and professional network. Hines recruited a local lawyer as a partner, Bob Cullen, whose nickname \"Cactus Bob\" was used to name the club. Mike's brother Calvin Trippett was brought in later as the booking agent for the club. The Cactus Club opened in 1988 and remained open until 2002.\n\nEmphasizing music, the club featured many local and national touring acts as well as themed dance nights.\n\nAmong the San Francisco Bay Area bands that got some of their start from playing the Cactus Club are Smash Mouth, The Donnas, Papa Roach, Insolence, Green Day, Alien Ant Farm, Carbonation and The Odd Numbers. The Cactus is often noted as being one of the first clubs in the Bay Area to attempt an end of pay-to-play practices that Bay Area clubs had been doing for a long time.\n\nMajor touring acts such as Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Korn, Queens of the Stone Age, Deftones, MC Hammer, Pigeon Project, Dropkick Murphys, Flogging Molly, Alanis Morissette, Mother Love Bone, Incubus, System of a Down, A Perfect Circle, Rage Against the Machine and Weezer have all played the Cactus Club. A famous story went around when Nirvana played to around 10 people at the club, and merely months later they were on top of the charts. The Red Hot Chili Peppers were among the first bands to play Cactus Club, playing January 16, 1988 with their original line-up.\n\nAfter closing in 2002, Cactus Club co-owner Craig Yamato opened a new nightclub in downtown San Jose called The Blank Club.\n\n"}

It is based on a book that features in Pratchett's \"Discworld\" novel \"Thud!\", in which Samuel Vimes reads it to his son.\n\n\"Where's My Cow?\" was released on 23 September 2005, to coincide with \"Thud!\". The cover bears a gold sticker reading \"OOK! The Ankh-Morpork Librarians' Award - Children's Winner\". This looks slightly similar to the Carnegie Medal sticker on the paperback of \"The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents\".\n\nThe book is written as a children's picture book and tells the story of Sam Vimes reading the picture book \"Where's My Cow?\" to Young Sam. The book describes the search for a cow, in which various animals that are not cows are identified by the noise they make.\n\nSam eventually decides that this is a daft way to look for a cow, and that Young Sam should, in any case, be getting taught about Ankh-Morpork rather than animals he will only see on a plate. He therefore attempts to rework the story into what he calls the 'Vimes street version', about a search for \"daddy\" through the city, encountering such characters as Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler, Foul Ole Ron, and the Patrician.\n\nIn \"Thud!\" we learn that the next day Young Sam said \"\"Buglit!\"\" (an attempt at Ron's distinctive \"Buggrit!\") and Sybil pointedly never raised the subject. Sam then stuck rigidly to the authorized version. In the framing story of \"Where's My Cow?\", Young Sam also says \"Buglit!\" when Sybil comes upstairs to see what all the excitement is.\n\nThere are three art styles in the book, all drawn by Melvyn Grant. The first art style is a fairly realistic style, with a slight cartoony feel. This is used for Vimes relating the story to Young Sam. The second style is that of the book within the book, which is simple, with thick lines and pastel colours. The pictures of Vimes and Young Sam are in front of these pictures, and do not interact with them.\n\nThe third style occurs when Vimes starts changing the story. The \"Discworld\" characters are drawn in the same style as Vimes and Young Sam, but the pastel animals are still present, and all three settings (the world of \"Where's My Cow?\", the streets of Ankh-Morpork, and Young Sam's nursery) begin blurring together. The objects in Young Sam's nursery also become animated. This quite possibly represents Young Sam's imagination.\n\nThe illustration of the nursery contains as an Easter egg a painting of the author himself, Terry Pratchett. Also of note is that the various other animals, which are mistaken for cows, are drawn in such a way that their outlines, combined with their surroundings, forms a cow shape. For example, the sheep has a tree's branches for horns and a rabbit chewing greenery for an udder, the horse has a pitchfork for horns and a chicken for an udder, etc.\n\nIn this book Vimes bears a passing resemblance to actor Pete Postlethwaite. Pratchett has previously commented that this is who he has always perceived Vimes as looking like, rather than Paul Kidby's 'Clint Eastwood' representation.\n\nThe book has played a cameo at the end of \"Wintersmith\", being read by the character Rob Anybody.\n\n"}

He created a form of cyborg life with the ability to think for itself. These cyborgs, dubbed the , soon ran out of control and killed Dr. Haran along with his whole family, save his youngest son, the 16-year-old Banjō Haran. Banjō escapes from Mars on a rocket with a solar-powered super robot called Daitarn 3, which was built with the special metals of Mars. Now 18 years old and living on Earth in a luxurious mansion, Banjō fights against the meganoids and their leader, Don Zauser and his second in command Koros, with the aid of his faithful butler Garrison, his two gorgeous companions, Reika and Beauty, and an orphan boy named Topo. Together they must stop the evil meganoids which aspire to turn all humans into cyborgs and thus \"improve\" the human race.\n\nSome of the staff fresh from Zambot 3 worked with Tomino on the Daitarn 3 project. The suave nature of the hero, Banjō Haran, was a direct attempt at capturing some of the spirit of the James Bond movies, which can be seen in the fact almost as much action takes place with Banjo, Reika Sanjō (ex-Interpol agent) and Beautiful Tachibana (also called \"Beauty\") playing superspies as Banjō fighting against Meganoid robots in Daitarn 3. Other important characters were Garrison Tokida, Banjo's trusted butler, and Toppo, a comic-relief character who gets rescued from a Meganoid-hijacked city block in Episode 2, and then stays with Banjō and company for no apparent reason.\n\nThe presence of faithful and reliable butler Garrison is a homage to Batman's character Alfred and others in similar American superhero series.\n\nAn interesting point to note is a light comedic element running through the whole series – the Meganoid foot soldiers exert some of their own personality with witty banter, bringing a fresh change to the silent drones which permeated super robot series previously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese entities act as the series' monsters of the week.\n\nDaitarn 3 has made appearance in many Super Robot Wars titles. Daitarn has also appeared in the Harobots series alongside its predecessor, Zambot 3, being able to perform a combination attack with it in some of the games.\n\nBanjo himself has been a significant character is many of the Super Robot Wars titles. One of the most notable appearances was in Super Robot Wars Z2 Saisei-hen where he manages to prevent the death of Shirley Fenette from \"Code Geass\" should the player gather enough \"Zero points\" throughout the game.\n\n"}
{"id": "2228091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2228091", "title": "Iovan Tsaous", "text": "Iovan Tsaous\n\nIovan Tsaous (, from the Turkish word \"çavuş\", meaning \"sergeant\") (1893–1942), was a Greek musician and composer of rebetiko songs from Pontus. His real name was Yiannis Eitziridis or Etseiridis (Γιάννης Εϊτζιρίδης or Ετσειρίδης).\n\nTsaous was born in 1893 in Kastamonu on Turkey's Black Sea coast. As a citizen of the Ottoman Empire, he completed his military service in the Ottoman army, attaining the rank of sergeant. After the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922), he came to Greece as a refugee and settled in Piraeus. He worked initially as a tailor for some years, before opening an ouzeri. He and his wife died in 1942 of food poisoning during the famine caused by the Nazi-Fascist occupation during WWII. Much of the information on his life comes from descendants of his sister-in-law.\n\nYovan Tsaous is particularly noted for the unique instruments he played. They were custom-built for him in Piraeus by the luthier Kyriakos Peismatoglou, and differed in one important respect from other plucked long-necked lutes in use in Greece at this time, in that they were not fretted according to the equal temperament division of the octave into twelve identical semitones. Instead they had sixteen frets to the octave, which permitted, among other things, the playing of microtonally different intervals such as the so-called three-quarter tone, and the neutral third, at certain positions on the fretboard. We know of at least three instruments, of which two have survived to the present day. The smallest was called \"baglamas\" although it did not resemble the instrument known by that name in the rebetiko context, being considerably larger, and in fact rather corresponding to what Greeks call \"tzourás\". The next in size was called \"sázi\", which had approximately the same vibrating string length as a bouzouki. Finally there was an instrument whose identity is still obscure. It is to be heard very clearly playing an introductory \"taxim\" to the song \"Diamánto alaniára\" (\"Διαμάντω αλανιάρα\"), during which is to be heard the exclamation \"Γιά σου Γιοβάν Τσαούς με το ταμπούρη σού\" (approx: Hi there Yovan Tsaous with your tambouri). What this tambouri actually was we may never know. It sounds as though it is a fretless instrument, with perhaps a parchment head rather than a soundboard of wood. It appears that Tsaous was almost alone in playing these particular instruments; the fact that they did not produce equally tempered intervals made them problematic in ensemble work, and this is readily audible in his recordings, which have a unique sound. He appears to have had at least one co-musician who played similarly tuned instruments, namely one G. Kikídis (gr. Γ. Κικίδης) who is given as playing bouzouki on a record label, but whose instrument pitches exactly in parallel with Tsaous' baglamas and does not sound like a bouzouki.\n\nTsaous is to be heard on at least fifteen recordings made between 1936 and 1937. The first twelve songs listed below were his own compositions. These songs have a truly idiosyncratic character, and resemble no other songs of the period in their melodic language, their subtle use of metre, and their use of intervals unusual in contemporary recordings. A further two songs were credited to Panagiotis Tountas, one more to Giorgos Kamvisis. The first six were sung by Antonis Kalyvopoulos, the following eight by Stellakis, and the last by Roza Eskenazi. Tsaous was band leader on at least the first twelve songs.

Its Music Director is Andrew Grams, who was named the 2015 Conductor of the Year by the Illinois Council of Orchestras. The Orchestra's season includes some 40 performances annually (Classics, Pops, Educational Programming, and Holiday performances) at the 1,200-seat Hemmens Cultural Center in Elgin and the 440-seat Prairie Arts Center in Schaumburg.\n\nThe Elgin Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1950 by Douglas Steensland at Elgin Community College. In 1971, with the appointment of Grammy Award-winning conductor Margaret Hillis as Music Director, the Orchestra’s artistic growth advanced significantly. Conductor/composer Robert Hanson was appointed the Orchestra's Associate Conductor in 1974 and Co-Music Director with Hillis in 1983. Hanson became Music Director in 1985, and the Orchestra achieved an artistic and service growth described by the Chicago Tribune as “impressive.” In 1985 the Orchestra became a fully professional ensemble. In 1988, 1999, 2005 and 2016, the Elgin Symphony Orchestra was named Orchestra of the Year by the Illinois Council of Orchestras. The Orchestra is the first four-time winner of the award recognizing programming excellence, artistic quality and leadership.\n\nIn 2011 Hanson stepped down as Music Director. Following a two-year search, the Orchestra on June 12, 2013, announced the appointment of Andrew Grams as its next Music Director.\n\nIsabella Lippi has been the Orchestra's concertmaster since 2004.\n\nIn 1996, the Elgin Symphony Orchestra moved its administrative and box offices from Elgin Community College, the Orchestra’s home for nearly 50 years, to downtown Elgin. In 1997, the Elgin Symphony Orchestra began broadcasting its Classic Series concerts on WFMT 98.7-FM, Chicago’s Fine Arts Station; performances are available on WFMT’s cable network in 38 states, and throughout the world on the Internet. Over the years the Elgin Symphony Orchestra has engaged world-renowned musicians including Benny Goodman, Yo-Yo Ma, Sir James Galway, Itzhak Perlman, Pinchas Zukerman, Janos Starker, Pepe Romero, Midori Goto, Rachel Barton Pine, Kathleen Battle, Jennifer Koh, Alisa Weilerstein, Nicola Benedetti, Jaime Laredo, and Lynn Harrell. Notable guest conductors include Giancarlo Guerrero, Rossen Milanov, and Ignat Solzhenitsyn.\n\nThe symphony began its Holiday Showcase at the Sears Centre arena in 2006 which became an annual event for three years bringing in hosts such as Jodi Benson and Phantom of the Opera star, Doug LaBrecque. It featured Cirque du Soleil aerialists and jugglers and Olympic ice skaters Melissa Gregory and Denis Petukhov.\n\nThe Planets Gala Concert with Leonard Nimoy was one of the symphony's high-profile events. It featured the Elgin Children's Chorus and had NASA visuals of the cosmos projected over the stage of The Hemmens Cultural Center while Leonard Nimoy narrated.\n\nIn 2008, the Orchestra released its first commercially recorded album on the Naxos label featuring music by Aaron Copland including the Piano Concerto with soloist Benjamin Pasternack and a suite from Copland's opera The Tender Land.\n\nIn 2011, the Elgin Master Chorale held a performance in collaboration with the ESO, which it named \"A Concert of Remembrance\", in memory of the September 11 attacks. It performed John Adams' On the Transmigration of Souls and Brahms' A German Requiem.\n\nInformation on ESO concerts and events is available at: http://www.ElginSymphony.Org\n\n"}

They speak a dialect of the Oromo language that is distinct enough that it is difficult for other Oromo speakers to understand. The Borana people are notable for practicing Gadaa system\nwithout interruption. They are predominantly Waaqeffataa.\n\nBetween the twelfth and fifteenth centuries, the Oromo people had differentiated into two major confederation of pastoral tribes: the Borana and the Barentu, and several minor ones. The Barentu people thereafter expanded to the eastern regions now called Hararghe, Arsi, Wello and northeastern Shawa. The Borana people, empowered by their \"Gadda\" political and military organization expanded in the other directions, regions now called western Shawa, Welega, Illubabor, Kaffa, Gamu Goffa, Sidamo and thereafter into what is now northern Kenya regions. The Borana further subdivided into various subgroups such as Macha, Tulama, Sadacha and others.\n\nThe Borana speak Borana (or \"afaan Booranaa\"), a dialect of Oromo language, which is part of the Cushitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic family of languages. In the border regions of Ethiopia-Kenya and southwestern Somalia, one estimate places about 1,094,000 people as Boranas. Another estimate in 2019 suggests 874,000 Boranas in Ethiopia, 210,000 in Kenya and 10,000 in Somalia. The Borana are the southernmost Horners of the Horn peninsula.\n\nThe Borana, Gabbra and Sakuye peoples are sub-ethnic groups within the Oromo people group, and share language and culture. Some groups from the Oromo people from southern Ethiopia entered northern Kenya during the 16th century. They then differentiated into the cattle-keeping Borana, while the Gabbra and Sakuye specialized in camel-keeping. They lived together, each with different pastoral focus. As competition for grazing lands and resources increased, conflicts emerged.\n\nThe Oromo people were traditionally a culturally homogeneous society with genealogical ties. The Borana and other Oromo communities governed themselves in accordance with \"gadaa\" (literally \"era\"), a limited democratic socio-political system long before the 16th century, when major three party wars commenced between them and the Christian kingdom to their north and Islamic sultanates to their east and south. The \"Gadaa\" system elected males from five Oromo \"miseensa\" (groups), for a period of eight years, for various judicial, political, ritual and religious roles. Retirement was compulsory after the eight year term, and each major clan followed the same \"gadaa\" system. Women and people belonging to the lower Oromo castes were excluded. Male born in the upper Oromo society went through five stages of eight years, where his life established his role and status for consideration to a \"gadaa\" office.\n\nUnder \"gadaa\", every eight years, the Oromo would choose by consensus an \"Abbaa Bokkuu\" responsible for justice, peace, judicial and ritual processes, an \"Abbaa Duulaa\" responsible as the war leader, an \"Abbaa Sa'aa\" responsible as the leader for cows, and other positions.\n\nLike other ethnic groups in the Horn of Africa and East Africa, Borana Oromo people regionally developed social stratification consisting of four hierarchical strata. The highest strata were the nobles called the \"Borana\", below them were the \"Gabbaro\" (some 17th to 19th century Ethiopian texts refer them as the \"dhalatta\"). Below these two upper castes were the despised castes of artisans, and at the lowest level were the slaves.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2228126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2228126", "title": "E2F", "text": "E2F\n\nE2F is a group of genes that encodes a family of transcription factors (TF) in higher eukaryotes. Three of them are activators: E2F1, 2 and E2F3a. Six others act as suppressors: E2F3b, E2F4-8. All of them are involved in the cell cycle regulation and synthesis of DNA in mammalian cells. E2Fs as TFs bind to the TTTCCCGC (or slight variations of this sequence) consensus binding site in the target promoter sequence.\n\nSchematic diagram of the amino acid sequences of E2F family members (N-terminus to the left, C-terminus to the right) highlighting the relative locations of functional domains within each member:\nHomo sapiens E2F1 mRNA or\nE2F1 protein sequences from NCBI protein and nucleotide database.\n\nX-ray crystallographic analysis has shown that the E2F family of transcription factors has a fold similar to the winged-helix DNA-binding motif.\n\nE2F family members play a major role during the G1/S transition in mammalian and plant cell cycle (see KEGG cell cycle pathway). DNA microarray analysis reveals unique sets of target promoters among E2F family members suggesting that each protein has a unique role in the cell cycle. Among E2F transcriptional targets are cyclins, CDKs, checkpoints regulators, DNA repair and replication proteins. Nonetheless, there is a great deal of redundancy among the family members. Mouse embryos lacking E2F1, E2F2, and one of the E2F3 isoforms, can develop normally when either E2F3a or E2F3b, is expressed.\n\nThe E2F family is generally split by function into two groups: transcription activators and repressors. Activators such as E2F1, E2F2, E2F3a promote and help carryout the cell cycle, while repressors inhibit the cell cycle. Yet, both sets of E2F have similar domains. E2F1-6 have DP1,2 heterodimerization domain which allows them to bind to DP1 or DP2, proteins distantly related to E2F. Binding with DP1,2 provides a second DNA binding site, increasing E2F binding stability. Most E2F have a pocket protein binding domain. Pocket proteins such as pRB and related proteins p107 and p130, can bind to E2F when hypophosphorylated. In activators, E2F binding with pRB has been shown to mask the transactivation domain responsible for transcription activation. In repressors E2F4 and E2F5, pocket protein binding (more often p107 and p130 than pRB) mediates recruitment of repression complexes to silence target genes. E2F6, E2F7, and E2F8 do not have pocket protein binding sites and their mechanism for gene silencing is unclear. Cdk4(6)/cyclin D and cdk2/cyclin E phosphorylate pRB and related pocket proteins allowing them to disassociate from E2F. Activator E2F proteins can then transcribe S phase promoting genes. In REF52 cells, overexpression of activator E2F1 is able to push quiescent cells into S phase. While repressors E2F4 and 5 do not alter cell proliferation, they mediate G1 arrest.\n\nE2F activator levels are cyclic, with maximal expression during G1/S. In contrast, E2F repressors stay constant, especially since they are often expressed in quiescent cells. Specifically, E2F5 is only expressed in terminally differentiated cells in mice. The balance between repressor and activator E2F regulate cell cycle progression. When activator E2F family proteins are knocked out, repressors become active to inhibit E2F target genes.\n\nThe Rb tumor suppressor protein (pRb) binds to the E2F1 transcription factor preventing it from interacting with the cell's transcription machinery. In the absence of pRb, E2F1 (along with its binding partner DP1) mediates the trans-activation of E2F1 target genes that facilitate the G1/S transition and S-phase. E2F targets genes that encode proteins involved in DNA replication (for example DNA polymerase, thymidine kinase, dihydrofolate reductase and cdc6), and chromosomal replication (replication origin-binding protein HsOrc1 and MCM5). When cells are not proliferating, E2F DNA binding sites contribute to transcriptional repression. In vivo footprinting experiments obtained on Cdc2 and B-myb promoters demonstrated E2F DNA binding site occupation during G0 and early G1, when E2F is in transcriptional repressive complexes with the pocket proteins.\n\npRb is one of the targets of the oncogenic human papilloma virus protein E7, and human adenovirus protein E1A. By binding to pRB, they stop the regulation of E2F transcription factors and drive the cell cycle to enable virus genome replication.\n\nActivators are maximally expressed late in G1 and can be found in association with E2F regulated promoters during the G1/S transition. The activation of E2F-3a genes follows upon the growth factor stimulation and the subsequent phosphorylation of the E2F inhibitor retinoblastoma protein, pRB. The phosphorylation of pRB is initiated by cyclin D/cdk4, cdk6 complex and continued by cyclin E/cdk2. Cyclin D/cdk4,6 itself is activated by the MAPK signaling pathway.\n\nWhen bound to E2F-3a, pRb can directly repress E2F-3a target genes by recruiting chromatin remodeling complexes and histone modifying activities (e.g. histone deacetylase, HDAC) to the promoter.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n"}
{"id": "2228132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2228132", "title": "Invincible Super Man Zambot 3", "text": "Invincible Super Man Zambot 3\n\nThere once existed a planet named Beal, until it was wiped out by the mysterious entity known as Gaizok. The few remaining survivors escaped to Earth and split into three families, named Jin, Kamie, and Kamikita respectively. While attempting to start a new life, the collectively known \"Jin Family\" prepared for the inevitable Gaizok invasion on Earth and its giant mechanical beasts known as \"Mecha Boosts\". In order to defend their new home, they have built three vehicles which when combined form the mighty Zambot 3. The Jin Family must not only defend against Gaizok attacks, but also harsh criticisms from the very people they protect, who blame the Jin Family for the invasion in the first place.\n\nThe show begins as a typical Super Robot anime, but effort to putting realistic explanation to the \"strangeness\" seen in the precedent anime like \"why young children are chosen for the pilots\" etc., trial to depict civilians' sufferings under the invasion of aliens, and also with the cruel Human Bomb episodes middle of the show and the tragic end that most protagonists are killed, this work is regarded as the most important forerunner to the Real Robot anime.\n\nDirector Yoshiyuki Tomino's nickname, \"Kill 'Em All Tomino\" originates from this work.\n\nKappei Jin is the main character of Zambot 3 and pilot of the Zambird/Zambo Ace as well as controlling the primary functions of the titular robot. At 12 years old, Kappei is always eager to get into dangerous, high-risk situations, be it in battle against one of Gaizok's Mecha Boosts or against his rival Kōzuki. While Kappei is generally willing to go into battle, he will at times run into an emotional dilemma, generally stemming from civilian backlash against the Beal-Seijin. Kappei is also very athletic and a skilled martial artist. His best friends are his pet dog, Chiyonishiki and the girls Aki and Michi. Out of the entire team, Kappei is the only member to survive the final battle, as Uchūta and Keiko perish in a successful suicide attack, Chiyonishiki is killed when the Zambo Ace's right lower leg (which houses his cockpit) is destroyed, and the rest of the Jin Family dies when their ship burns up while they are giving Kappei time to escape.\n\nChiyonishiki is Kappei's pet dog akita inu and his faithful friend, who \"copilots\" Zambird alongside Kappei. Yoshinori Kanada of Studio Z misunderstood him as a robot dog, so there are some scenes which implicate his robotic nature.\n\nUchūta Kamie is 15 years old and pilot of the Zambull. While Uchūta is more mature than Kappei, he is about as eager to jump into battle, to the point that early on in the series Kappei and Uchūta would argue over who should be doing most of the fighting. Uchūta has to deal with a family that is not as devoted to the fight against Gaizok as himself. In the final battle, he and Keiko perish in a successful suicide attack.\n\nKeiko Kamikita is 14 years old and pilot of the Zambase. On the Kamikita's ranch, Keiko's hobbies are archery and horseback riding. While not as overtly aggressive as her male teammates, Keiko is if anything more willing to fight Gaizok, even at times attempting to pilot despite bodily injury. While Keiko has the strongest convictions of the team, she is also perhaps the most emotionally vulnerable. One of Keiko's most famous lines is, \"Please transform, and don't make a girl say 'please!'\" In the final battle, she and Uchūta perish in a successful suicide attack.\n\nHeizaemon Kamikita is Keiko's grandfather and commander of the King Beal.\n\nGengoroh Jin is Kappei's father.\n\nIchitaroh Jin is Kappei's older brother.\n\nShingo Kōzuki is 13 years old and the leader of a local gang of kids. Shingo (most frequently referred to as Kōzuki in the series) is essentially Kappei's rival, as both have tendencies to play in the most dangerous ways possible, e.g. fighting each other with anchors. Like Kappei, Shingo is a skilled martial artist. Shingo is a civilian and does not pilot any anti-Gaizok vehicles, but he is nevertheless thrust into the middle of the conflict due to both circumstances beyond his control and through his own actions. Shingo has a mother and a sister, Kaoru, of whom he is very protective.\n\nKaoru Kōzuki is Shingo's little sister. Unlike most others, Kaoru sees the Jin Family and particularly Kappei as good people.\n\nAki is 12 years old and can be seen as Kappei's \"love interest.\" Along with her best friend, Michi, Kappei frequently takes them along on his adventures, both in and out of Zambird. Aki is very sensible and confident, and will give Kappei a few harsh words if need be. At the same time, she is rather impressed by Kappei and the Zambird. The Zambot Archives book refers to Aki and Michi as the \"Kappei Fan Club.\"\n\nMichi is 12 years old and best friends with Aki. Michi, like Aki, tends to follow Kappei for one reason or another. Shyer and more reserved than Aki, Michi is usually worried about what will happen to them whenever Kappei does anything dangerous/stupid. The Zambot Archives book refers to Aki and Michi as the \"Kappei Fan Club.\"\n\nGaizok is the mysterious entity responsible for the destruction of the planet Beal. He seeks to do the same to Earth as he did to Beal, and perhaps other planets as well. No one knows Gaizok's true motives or even his true identity, including his subordinate, Killer the Butcher. In the last episodes, Gaizok is revealed to be an extremely evolved artificial intelligence, that was once created by an ancient, super-advanced civilization, with the task of destroying anyone that would display aggressive feelings. But, having turned mad with old age, Gaizok has come to the conclusion that every feelings are dangerous and must be suppressed, meaning the destruction of all sentient beings.\n\nKiller the Butcher is the most prominent villain in Zambot 3. Butcher is responsible for sending out Mecha Boosts to attack the Earth, particularly Japan. Butcher is a rather eccentric villain, and is seen constantly indulging in luxuries, be it eating endless amounts of meat, trying on jewelry, or attempting to sun bathe despite being inside of the Bandok. However, this extravagance does not make him any less ruthless. Butcher was sent to kill the humans, and that's exactly what he plans to do. Butcher's headquarters is the powerful mobile fortress, Bandok.\n\nGizzar is Butcher's right-hand man and field commander coming up with diabolical plots. Unlike Butcher he takes his job very seriously and is very thin, but he is still just as ruthless. Gizzar is often Butcher's whipping boy whenever something goes wrong.\n\nBarettar is a field commander nearly identical to Gizzar except for muscular and has scars all over his face.\n\nZubutar is the Bandok's chief designer of the Mecha-Boosts.\n\nSnai-Sworders are small snail-like reconnaissance robots used by Butcher to observe battles. They possess no offensive capabilities.\n\nBandok is the four-legged robot space fortress commanded by Butcher. For the first nine episodes it serves as only a headquarters near Earth's orbit where Mecha-Boosts are produced. In episode ten it comes to Earth and releases a series of Beltar Tanks to defend itself. After Mecha-Boost Tracid is destroyed, Zambot 3 attempts to attack only for a barrier to knock it away. In the next episode it is forced to flee back into space after being destroyed internally by Zambo Ace. Returns to Earth in episode 18 as the primary facility for converting humans into living bombs, keeping itself underwater at well over twelve hundred meters below the surface until Zambot 3 discovers its location. The head detaches itself and starts firing extremely large torpedoes at Zambot 3 from its mouth as well as stops the Moon Attack with an energy barrier. It retreats to space again in episode 19 after large quantities of damage and the energy barrier being destroyed by Zambot 3's Moon Attack and destruction of Mecha-Boost Gaidar. In episode 21 the Bandok uses well over two thousand space mines and homing missiles with eyeballs for nose cones called Gaizok Missiles to attack the King Beal as the Jin family approaches for the final battle. When King Beal is close enough, each arm of the Bandok fires a Bandok Cannon presumably just as powerful as the Ion Cannon. After 2nd Beal rams into its underside the main body is ultimately destroyed with the head being all that is left. In its final battle in episode 22 the head piloted by Butcher fires Bandok Missiles and eye lasers only for it to be finished off by the Ion Cannon.\n\nRed Knight Deathcain and Blue Knight Heldyne are the two knights of Gaizok sealed within the Bandok as its guardians. Both appearing in episode 22 after most of the Bandok was destroyed, Butcher is forced into battle by Gaizok with both of these death personified knights as a last resort. Both appear as European knights on horses. Each one is armed with a small round shield that fires lightning bolts that can be combined for an extremely bright flash that launches swords and maces, although Deathcain possesses a sword while Heldyne possesses a double sided lance.\n\nMecha-Boosts\n\n\nZambot 3, along with the King Beal, are the primary defenses against the Gaizok invasion. Zambot 3 is formed when the Zambird, Zambull and Zambase combine by a sequence called Zambot Combination. There is a separate cockpit for each pilot. In the final battle, the Zambull and Zambase are destroyed in Uchūta and Keiko's successful suicide attack, and the Zambo Ace is damaged beyond repair.\n\nHeight: 60 meters<br>\nWeight: 500 tons<br>\nOutput: 350,000 horsepower (260 MW)<br>\nEnergy source: Ion energy<br>\nMain weapons\n\nWeaknesses: Zambot 3 has very few glaring design flaws, but the most prominent one is that its armor begins to fail when in waters deeper than 7000 meters.\n\nPilot: Kappei Jin\n\nZambird is a high-speed aerial vehicle which is able to go faster than Japan Self-Defense Force fighter jets.

{"id": "2228160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2228160", "title": "Tenspeed and Brown Shoe", "text": "Tenspeed and Brown Shoe\n\nTenspeed and Brown Shoe is an American detective/comedy series originally broadcast by the ABC network between January and June 1980. The series was created and executive produced by Stephen J. Cannell. Most of the show's creative staff (Cannell, Juanita Bartlett, Gordon T. Dawson) were veterans of the private detective series \"The Rockford Files\", which concluded its run about two weeks before \"Tenspeed and Brown Shoe\" debuted.\n\nThe one-hour program revolved around two detectives who had their own detective agency in Los Angeles. E. L. (\"Early Leroy\") \"Tenspeed\" Turner (Ben Vereen) was a hustler who worked as a detective to satisfy his parole requirements. His partner Lionel \"Brownshoe\" Whitney (Jeff Goldblum) was an archetypal accountant, complete with button-down collars and a nagging fiancee (at least for the pilot episode), who had always wanted to be a 1940s-style Bogart P.I. A running joke was his penchant for reading a series of hard-boiled crime novels, subtitled \"A Mark Savage Mystery\", written by Stephen J. Cannell (though he never wrote such a series of novels), with Goldblum reading some passages in voice-over. He was sharper than he seemed, although a little naïve and more reasonable than his career path demanded, and had picked up karate to black-belt standard.\n\n\nThis was the first series to come from Stephen J. Cannell Productions as an independent company (it was distributed through Paramount Television, one of only two such collaborations - the other was \"Riptide\") and is also the only one not to carry the famed Cannell logo on any episodes, having \"A Stephen J. Cannell Production\" appearing in-credit (the logo was introduced in 1981 when \"The Greatest American Hero\" began airing).\n\nThe show had broad similarities to the later television series \"Simon & Simon\" and \"Moonlighting\", in that it was a lightly dramatic program with many comedic moments about two dissimilar detectives who attempt to solve cases together. Cannell recycled the basic idea of \"Tenspeed and Brown Shoe\" (a crime-solver on the right side of the law working with and taking responsibility for the rehabilitation of an ex-criminal) in watered-down form as the successful \"Hardcastle and McCormick\".\n\nThe show was heavily promoted by ABC at the time it premiered in late January 1980. The series attracted a substantial audience for its first few episodes (indeed, the series was the 29th-most watched program of the 1979–80 U.S. television season, according to Nielsen ratings), but viewership dropped off substantially after that, and the series was not renewed for the 1980–81 season.\n\nOn March 9, 2010, Mill Creek Entertainment released \"Tenspeed and Brown Shoe\" on DVD in Region 1 for the first time. Because CBS, who held ownership of the pilot, refused to come to an agreement on its use, MCI revealed in January 2010 that it would not be included on the DVD. However, the full-length pilot is included in the German DVD release.\n\nBen Vereen later reprised his role as Tenspeed on five episodes of \"J.J. Starbuck\", another Cannell production:\n\n"}
{"id": "2228163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2228163", "title": "Syphon recorder", "text": "Syphon recorder\n\nThe syphon or siphon recorder is an obsolete electromechanical device used as a receiver for submarine telegraph cables invented by William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin in 1867. It automatically records an incoming telegraph message as a wiggling ink line on a roll of paper tape. Later a trained telegrapher would read the tape, translating the pulses representing the \"dots\" and \"dashes\" of the Morse code to characters of the text message.\n\nThe syphon recorder replaced Thomson’s mirror galvanometer as the standard receiving instrument for submarine telegraph cables, allowing long cables to be worked using just a few volts at the sending end. The disadvantage of the mirror galvanometer was that it required two operators, one with a steady eye to read and call off the signal, the other to write down the characters received. Its use spread to ordinary telegraph lines and radiotelegraphy radio receivers. A major advantage of the syphon recorder was that no operator has to monitor the line constantly waiting for messages to come in. The paper tape preserved a record of the actual message before translation to text, so errors in translation could be checked.\n\nThe siphon recorder works on the principle of a d'Arsonval galvanometer. A light coil of wire is suspended between the poles of a permanent magnet so it can turn freely. The coil is attached via two wire linkages to the metal plate siphon support, which pivots on a horizontal suspension thread. From this plate a narrow glass siphon tube hangs down vertically with its end almost touching a paper tape. The paper tape is pulled by motorized rollers at a constant speed under the siphon pen. Ink is drawn up from a reservoir into the tube by siphon action and comes out a tiny orifice in the end of the siphon tube, drawing a line down the moving paper tape. In order not to affect the motion of the coil, the siphon tube itself never touches the paper, only the ink.\n\nThe current from the telegraph line is applied to the coil. The pulses of current representing the Morse code \"dots\" and \"dashes\" flowing through the coil create a magnetic field which interacts with the magnetic field of the magnet, creating a torque which causes the coil to rotate slightly about its vertical suspension axis. The wire linkages cause the siphon support plate to rotate about its horizontal axis, swinging the siphon tube across the paper tape. This draws a displacement in the ink line on the tape as long as the current is present in the coil. Thus the ink line on the tape forms a graph of the current in the telegraph line, with displacements representing the \"dots\" and \"dashes\" of the Morse code. An operator knowing Morse code later translates the line on the tape to characters of the text message, and types them onto a telegram form.\n\nThe siphon and an ink reservoir are together supported by an ebonite bracket, separate from the rest of the instrument, and insulated from it. This separation permits the ink to be electrified to a high potential while the body of the instrument, including the paper and metal writing tablet, are grounded, and at low potential. The tendency of a charged body is to move from a place of higher to a place of lower potential, and consequently the ink tends to flow downwards to the writing tablet. The only avenue of escape for it is by the fine glass siphon, and through this it rushes accordingly and discharges itself upon the paper. The natural repulsion between its like-electrified particles causes the shower to issue in spray. As the paper moves over the pulleys a delicate hair line is marked, straight when the syphon is stationary, but curved when the siphon is pulled from side to side by the oscillations of the signal coil.\n\nPower to pull the roll of paper tape through the syphon recorder was usually supplied by one Froment's mouse mill motors. These also drove an electrostatic machine to generate the electricity to power the syphon.\n\nA simpler mechanism was developed by Alexander Muirhead. This used a vibrating pen to avoid the same problem of the ink sticking to the paper. The recording pen was suspended on a thin wire, vibrated by an electromagnet mechanism similar to that of an electric bell, to break contact with the paper.\n"}

It is a municipality in Vellore district in the state of Tamil Nadu in India. It is the Most populated Town in Vellore District before and after Separation of Tirupattur and Ranipet Districts. It is located at the centre of two megacities namely Bangalore and Chennai. District headquarters Vellore is 31 km away from the town. In 2011, the town had a population of 2,35,672. This is where the first Indian national flag was woven. Gudiyatham is a first-grade municipality. It was named Gudiyatham Municipality in 1886.The town is strong hold of Labours of Match box Industry and Hand Looming.\n\nThe occupation of the ancient town is artistic weaving by manual viz., Handloom weaving . To add glory of the profession and industry the Handloom weaved National flag which was prepared by weavers of this town was hoisted at New Delhi – Redfort being the 1st Indian National flag. In appreciation of this, the national leaders viz., Motilal Nehru and Sardar Vallabai Patel in their letter dated 12.08.1947 has commented and complimented the weavers.\n\nThe town was built by Kulothunga cholan during his reign. He named it as \"Kudiyetra-nallur\" which denotes, a place that suits for good and hood living.\n\nthe city was formerly created by kulothunga chola by extending lands.he named it as Jayamkonda sathurvethi mangalam.after few years many people settled to this town,in order to remember mass migration they named as kudiyattrem,which inturned to gudiyattam.\n\nHistorically the existence of the town is very well found in ancient inscription of Kulothunga Cholan 1st regime during 1705 A.D. This town is surrounded by a good number of temples. This town surpassed enrichment and advancement due to these good number of temples. To add glory of the existence of the town , an inscription of 14th Century found at Chenji ( now in Cuddalore District ) also reveals that existence of the town in the name of “ GUDI-YETRAM ”. Temple of Kappuleeswarar is in existence during the period of Kulothunkkan 1st dynasty. During the regime , the king had denoted 90 ghots for maintenance and for purchase of oild for lighting.

{"id": "2228199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2228199", "title": "Between the Lines (TV series)", "text": "Between the Lines (TV series)\n\nBetween the Lines is a television police drama series created by J. C. Wilsher and produced by World Productions for the BBC. It was first shown on BBC1 between 1992 and 1994, running for three series.\n\nThe show centred on the eventful life of Detective Superintendent Tony Clark, played by Neil Pearson. Clark was an ambitious member of the Complaints Investigation Bureau (CIB), an internal organisation of the Metropolitan Police that investigates complaints against officers as well as claims of corruption inside the police force. Along the way Clark had to overcome strong influence from his superiors and problems in his private life, most notably the break-up of his marriage following an affair with WPC Jenny Dean (Lesley Vickerage). Throughout the series Clark was assisted by colleagues Harry Naylor (Tom Georgeson) and Maureen 'Mo' Connell (Siobhan Redmond).\n\nThe show became a surprise hit for the BBC, winning a British Academy Television Award (BAFTA) for Best Drama Series in 1994. In 2000 it was voted into the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes by the British Film Institute. The series was reviewed in an episode of the BBC documentary series \"Call the Cops\", which stated the series had \"found a way of getting to grips with the corruption scandals of the 1990s\".\n\nExecutive producer Tony Garnett had begun his career as an actor before becoming a producer in the late 1960s. His credits included \"The Wednesday Play\" and \"Play for Today\". Following \"Between the Lines\", he went on to produce several popular and notable series including \"This Life\" (1996–97), \"Ballykissangel\" and \"The Cops\" (1998–2000).\n\nClark's work as a lead officer in CIB was the focus of the first two series. In the first series his boss was Deakin, a tough ex-RUC Northern Irish policeman. At the end of the first series, Deakin was revealed to be a corrupt officer himself. He left the force but remained a recurring character, working freelance for the security services and others, sometimes in conflict with Clark and sometimes assisting him. At the start of the third series (after a dramatic shoot-out at the end of the second) Clark, Naylor and Connell leave the police force and work in the murky world of private security, far-right political groups and espionage.\n\nThe third series ends with the betrayal of Clark and Naylor who had been masquerading as mercenaries. The betrayal is made by Connell in league with Deakin, their former boss and nemesis. It is unclear whether Clark and Naylor have died as the show ended on a cliffhanger. Rumours of a remake did circulate for some years, but Pearson confirmed in 'Watching the Detectives' that he had wanted a 'final' ending at the time and would never return to the role.\n\n\"Between The Lines\" was one of the first British TV dramas to include a bisexual character (whose sexual orientation is incidental rather than central to the plot). Maureen (Mo) Connell (Siobhan Redmond) has two significant romantic partners during the series, a husband in the first series (whom she divorces), and later on a long-term girlfriend. While some other police officers are briefly shown making disapproving comments (e.g. when she brings her girlfriend as plus-one to a police social), her bisexuality is shown as completely accepted by close colleagues, if a subject of occasional friendly banter (e.g. Mo mentions having a date that night, Tony asks \"girl or boy?\" and she replies sarcastically \"one of each\".)\n\nUntil the 1970s, complaints against the police in Britain were dealt with internally, with no outside oversight, leading to public dissatisfaction amid allegations that misconduct and corruption were not being effectively dealt with. The 1976 Police Act established the Police Complaints Board, an independent review body, but following the Scarman Report in 1982 this was replaced by the more effective Police Complaints Authority, creating the background of the series. However, even today, under the current Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), the majority of complaints against the police are dealt with internally. The IPCC investigates the most serious cases and deals with appeals. At the time of the series in the 1990s, the department of the Metropolitan Police responsible for internal investigations was the Complaints Investigation Bureau (CIB); it has subsequently been replaced by the Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS).\n\nThe two first series of Between the Lines is a dramatisation of the work of the CIB. In the third series focus is shifted more towards the secret services and MI5 in particular. John Deakin, whose shadow is present throughout all three series, has a past in the Ulster police. He is the \"fireproof\" high rank detective who decides which other high ranked detectives that may use which methods. Tony manages to discover who he really is, but not good enough. Deakin also has contacts in the secret services. And the final two episodes (\"The End User\" 1 & 2) deals with a story of illegal weapon smuggling to Northern Ireland.

{"id": "2228245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2228245", "title": "Quadrupole ion trap", "text": "Quadrupole ion trap\n\nA quadrupole ion trap is a type of ion trap that uses dynamic electric fields to trap charged particles. They are also called radio frequency (RF) traps or Paul traps in honor of Wolfgang Paul, who invented the device and shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1989 for this work. It is used as a component of a mass spectrometer or a trapped ion quantum computer.\n\nA charged particle, such as an atomic or molecular ion, feels a force from an electric field. It is not possible to create a static configuration of electric fields that traps the charged particle in all three directions (this restriction is known as Earnshaw's theorem). It is possible, however, to create an \"average\" confining force in all three directions by use of electric fields that change in time. To do so, the confining and anti-confining directions are switched at a rate faster than it takes the particle to escape the trap. The traps are also called \"radio frequency\" traps because the switching rate is often at a radio frequency.\n\nThe quadrupole is the simplest electric field geometry used in such traps, though more complicated geometries are possible for specialized devices. The electric fields are generated from electric potentials on metal electrodes. A pure quadrupole is created from hyperbolic electrodes, though cylindrical electrodes are often used for ease of fabrication. Microfabricated ion traps exist where the electrodes lie in a plane with the trapping region above the plane. There are two main classes of traps, depending on whether the oscillating field provides confinement in three or two dimensions. In the two-dimension case (a so-called \"linear RF trap\"), confinement in the third direction is provided by static electric fields.\n\nThe 3D trap itself generally consists of two hyperbolic metal electrodes with their foci facing each other and a hyperbolic ring electrode halfway between the other two electrodes. The ions are trapped in the space between these three electrodes by AC (oscillating) and DC (static) electric fields. The AC radio frequency voltage oscillates between the two hyperbolic metal end cap electrodes if ion excitation is desired; the driving AC voltage is applied to the ring electrode. The ions are first pulled up and down axially while being pushed in radially. The ions are then pulled out radially and pushed in axially (from the top and bottom). In this way the ions move in a complex motion that generally involves the cloud of ions being long and narrow and then short and wide, back and forth, oscillating between the two states. Since the mid-1980s most 3D traps (Paul traps) have used ~1 mTorr of helium. The use of damping gas and the mass-selective instability mode developed by Stafford et al. led to the first commercial 3D ion traps.\nThe quadrupole ion trap has two main configurations: the three-dimensional form described above and the linear form made of 4 parallel electrodes. A simplified rectilinear configuration is also used. The advantage of the linear design is its greater storage capacity (in particular of Doppler-cooled ions) and its simplicity, but this leaves a particular constraint on its modeling. The Paul trap is designed to create a saddle-shaped field to trap a charged ion, but with a quadrupole, this saddle-shaped electric field cannot be rotated about an ion in the centre. It can only 'flap' the field up and down. For this reason, the motions of a single ion in the trap are described by Mathieu equations, which can only be solved numerically by computer simulations.\n\nThe intuitive explanation and lowest order approximation is the same as strong focusing in accelerator physics. Since the field affects the acceleration, the position lags behind (to lowest order by half a period). So the particles are at defocused positions when the field is focusing and vice versa. Being farther from center, they experience a stronger field when the field is focusing than when it is defocusing.\n\nIons in a quadrupole field experience restoring forces that drive them back toward the center of the trap. The motion of the ions in the field is described by solutions to the Mathieu equation. When written for ion motion in a trap, the equation is\n\nwhere formula_2 represents the x, y and z coordinates, formula_3 is a dimensionless variable given by formula_4, and formula_5 and formula_6 are dimensionless trapping parameters. The parameter formula_7 is the radial frequency of the potential applied to the ring electrode. By using the chain rule, it can be shown that\n\nSubstituting Equation 2 into the Mathieu Equation 1 yields\n\nMultiplying by m and rearranging terms shows us that\n\nBy Newton's laws of motion, the above equation represents the force on the ion. This equation can be exactly solved using the Floquet theorem or the standard techniques of multiple scale analysis. The particle dynamics and time averaged density of charged particles in a Paul trap can also be obtained by the concept of ponderomotive force.\n\nThe forces in each dimension are not coupled, thus the force acting on an ion in, for example, the x dimension is\n\nHere, formula_12 is the quadrupolar potential, given by\n\nwhere formula_14 is the applied electric potential and formula_15, formula_16, and formula_17 are weighting factors, and formula_18 is a size parameter constant. In order to satisfy Laplace's equation, formula_19, it can be shown that\n\nFor an ion trap, formula_21 and formula_22 and for a quadrupole mass filter, formula_23 and formula_24.\n\nTransforming Equation 6 into a cylindrical coordinate system with formula_25, formula_26, and formula_27 and applying the Pythagorean trigonometric identity formula_28 gives\n\nThe applied electric potential is a combination of RF and DC given by\n\nwhere formula_31 and formula_32 is the applied frequency in hertz.\n\nSubstituting Equation 8 into Equation 6 with formula_33 gives\n\nSubstituting Equation 9 into Equation 5 leads to\n\nComparing terms on the right hand side of Equation 1 and Equation 10 leads to\n\nand\n\nFurther formula_38,\n\nand\n\nThe trapping of ions can be understood in terms of stability regions in formula_41 and formula_42 space. The boundaries of the shaded regions in the figure are the boundaries of stability in the two directions (also known as boundaries of bands). The domain of overlap\nof the two regions is the trapping domain. For calculation of these boundaries and similar diagrams as above see Müller-Kirsten.\n\nThe linear ion trap uses a set of quadrupole rods to confine ions radially and a static electrical potential on-end electrodes to confine the ions axially. The linear form of the trap can be used as a selective mass filter, or as an actual trap by creating a potential well for the ions along the axis of the electrodes. Advantages of the linear trap design are increased ion storage capacity, faster scan times, and simplicity of construction (although quadrupole rod alignment is critical, adding a quality control constraint to their production. This constraint is additionally present in the machining requirements of the 3D trap).\n\nIon traps with a cylindrical rather than a hyperbolic ring electrode have been developed and microfabricated in arrays to develop miniature mass spectrometers for chemical detection in medical diagnosis and other fields.\n\nQuadrupole traps can also be \"unfolded\" to create the same effect using a set of planar electrodes. This trap geometry can be made using standard micro-fabrication techniques, including the top metal layer in a standard CMOS microelectronics process, and is a key technology for scaling trapped ion quantum computers to useful numbers of qubits.\n\nA combined radio frequency trap is a combination of a Paul ion trap and a Penning trap. One of the main bottlenecks of a quadrupole ion trap is that it can confine only single-charged species or multiple species with similar masses. But in certain applications like antihydrogen production it is important to confine two species of charged particles of widely varying masses. To achieve this objective, a uniform magnetic field is added in the axial direction of the quadrupole ion trap.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2228278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2228278", "title": "Rose Bertin", "text": "Rose Bertin\n\nMarie-Jeanne Rose Bertin (2 July 1747, Abbeville, Picardy, France – 22 September 1813, Épinay-sur-Seine) was a French milliner (\"Marchande de modes\"), known as the dressmaker to Queen Marie Antoinette. She was the first celebrated French fashion designer and is widely credited with having brought fashion and \"haute couture\" to the forefront of popular culture.\n\nRose Bertin was the daughter of Nicolas Bertin (d. 1754) and Marie-Marguerite Méquignon, and spent her childhood in St Gilles in Picardie. She came from a family of small means; her mother worked as a sick nurse, which at the time was a profession with very low salary and status, and the financial situation became even worse after the death of her father. She and her brother Jean-Laurent received a modest education, but had a high level of ambition. \n\nAt the age of sixteen, Rose Bertin moved to Paris, where she became apprenticed to a successful milliner, Mademoiselle Pagelle, with clients among the aristocracy. Bertin’s early success cannot be attributed to her good relations with the Princesse de Conti, the Duchesse de Chartres and the Princesse de Lamballe, who would one day arrange her meeting with Marie Antoinette. After having acquired a big order for Pagelle, she became her business partner. \n\nIn 1770, Bertin opened her own dress shop, \"Le Grand Mogol\", on the Rue Saint-Honoré with the support of the Duchesse de Chartres (it moved to 26 Rue de Richelieu in 1789). She quickly found customers among influential noble ladies at Versailles, many of whom followed her from Mademoiselle Pagelle’s, including many ladies-in-waiting to the new Dauphine, Marie Antoinette.\n\nBefore Marie Antoinette arrived in France from Austria, she had been schooled in the nuances of \"galant\" spoken French and French fashions. She was introduced to Bertin in 1772. Twice a week, soon after Louis XVI’s coronation, Bertin would present her newest creations to the queen and spend hours discussing them. The queen adored her wardrobe and was passionate about every detail, and Bertin, as her milliner, became her confidante and friend. Her position as the designer of the queen also secured her the position as the leading fashion designer of the French aristocracy and, as French fashion was the leader in Europe, the central figure of European fashion. \n\nCalled \"Minister of Fashion\" by her detractors, Bertin was the brains behind almost every new dress commissioned by the queen. Dresses and hair became Marie Antoinette's personal vehicles of expression, and Bertin clothed the queen from 1770 until her deposition in 1792. Bertin became a powerful figure at court, and she witnessed—and sometimes effected—profound changes in French society. Her large, ostentatious gowns ensured that their wearer occupied at least three times as much space as her male counterpart, thus making the woman a more imposing presence. Her creations also established France as the center of the fashion industry, and from then on, dresses made in Paris were sent to London, Venice, Vienna, Saint Petersburg and Constantinople. This inimitable Parisian elegance established the worldwide reputation of French couture. \n\nIn the mid-18th century, French women had begun to \"pouf\" (raise) their hair with pads and pomade and wore oversized luxurious gowns. Bertin used and exaggerated the leading modes of the day, and created poufs for Marie Antoinette with heights up to three feet. The pouf fashion reached such extremes that it became a period trademark, along with decorating the hair with ornaments and objects which showcased current events. Working with Léonard Autié, the queen's hairdresser, Bertin created a coiffure that became the rage all over Europe: hair would be accessorized, stylized, cut into defining scenes, and modeled into shapes and objects—ranging from recent gossip to nativities to husbands' infidelities, to French naval vessels such as the \"Belle Poule\", to the pouf \"aux insurgents\" in honor of the American Revolutionary War. The queen's most famous coif was the \"inoculation\" pouf that she wore to publicize her success in persuading the king to be vaccinated against smallpox.\n\nMarie Antoinette also asked Bertin to dress dolls in the latest fashions as gifts for her sisters and her mother, the Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. Bertin's fashion dolls were called \"Pandores,\" and were made of wax over jointed wood armatures or porcelain. There were small ones the size of a common toy doll, or large ones as big or half as big as a real person, \"petites Pandores\" and \"grandes Pandores\". Fashion dolls as couriers of modes remained in vogue until the appearance of Fashion magazines.\n\nWith the queen's patronage, Bertin's name became synonymous with the sartorial elegance and excess of Versailles. Bertin's close relationship with the queen provided valuable background into the social and political significance of fashion at the French court. The frequent meetings between the queen and her \"couturière\" were met, however, with hostility from the poorer classes, given Bertin's high prices: her gowns and headdresses could easily cost twenty times what a skilled worker of the time earned in a year.\n\nDuring Marie Antoinette’s imprisonment, Bertin continued to receive orders from her former prized customer, for much smaller, almost negligible, orders of ribbons and simple alterations. She was to provide the former queen’s mourning outfit following the execution of Louis XVI, recalling a dream that Marie Antoinette had had years before of her favorite milliner handing her ribbons that all turned to black.\n\nThe French Revolution did not immediately diminish her business despite the emigration of many of her clients abroad, and she continued to be in favor of the queen, though the bills were significantly lower. \n\nAccording to Léonard Autié, he, Rose Bertin and Henriette Campan collectively contributed to the secret negotiations between the queen and Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau by informing her about political gossip and public opinion and the fear that Mirabeau would ally himself with the Duke of Orléans. Their information allegedly convinced the queen to meet Auguste Marie Raymond d'Arenberg in the rooms of her maid Marie-Élisabeth Thibault and ask him to meet with Mirabeau in the home of Florimond Claude, Comte de Mercy-Argenteau, resulting in contact between the queen and Mirabeau. \n\nBertin made several journeys abroad during the Revolution, which attracted attention. She made a trip to England and Germany in 1791-92, leading to suspicions that she was acting as Marie Antoinette's agent. According to these speculations, she secretly visited Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor to deliver a message from Marie Antoinette, as the latter's correspondence was scrutinized and an oral message through a loyal messenger was regarded as the safest method to deliver a sensitive message across borders. This is unconfirmed, but not improbable, as the queen is confirmed to have used her hairdresser Léonard Autié as a messenger during the Flight to Varennes, and it is noted that Henriette Campan claimed that the queen managed to get secret messages to her nephew the emperor during this period. Officially, these were business trips, and Bertin is confirmed to have been in Germany in July 1791, when her presence is noted at the French emigré court in the Castle Schoenbornhut in Koblenz, where she was said to have contributed to the extravagant fashion of the women attending the court. \n\nBertin was absent from France during the September Massacres, which resulted in her being placed in the list of emigrés. She managed to have herself removed from the list and returned to France in December 1792 to attend to her business. During this stay, popular legend says she destroyed her account books in order to spare the queen from having her bills used against her during her trial. However, this does not appear to be true: all the bills of the queen prior to August 1792 was already in the possession of the government through Henry, liquidator of the civil estate, and there was at that point not yet a trial planned against Marie Antoinette. It would therefore have been pointless for Bertin to destroy her account books for that reason, and the bills of Marie Antoinette was in fact inherited by her heirs, who would demand payment of them until 1830. \n\nIn February 1793, Rose Bertin left France for London. For a while, she was able to serve her old clients among the émigrés, and her fashion dolls continued to circulate among European capitals, as far away as Saint Petersburg. During these years, she mainly lived on demanding the payment of old bills owed to her by her old foreign clients, such as the queen of Sweden, Sophia Magdalena of Denmark. Her business in Paris still operated, despite her absence, through representatives she appointed and the money she sent to it from London, and she still delivered orders to Marie Antoinette.\n\nIn January 1795, Rose Bertin managed to have her name struck from the list of emigrés through her lawyer, who claimed that she had been absent legally since she left the country for business purposes on a legal passport in July 1792 (omitting her stay there in December 1792-February 1793), and she was thus free to return and resume her business. She allegedly acted as a secret messenger for the emigrés during this trip, and it is known that she provided them with funds, but this could have been merely a sign of her well-known generosity. \n\nHer business never quite recovered, partially because of the inflation and partially because the fashion excesses of the era had waned after the French Revolution ended, and she was eventually replaced as leading fashion designer by Louis Hippolyte Leroy.

Credited with breaking down barriers of racial segregation in professional wrestling, Harris is considered one of the first successful African-American professional wrestlers.\n\nHouston Harris was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, but later lived in East St. Louis, Illinois, and Benton Harbor, Michigan. He played baseball in the Negro Leagues for The House of David, where he was discovered to become a wrestler at a steel mill.\n\nHarris was trained by Joe Savoldi after meeting him at matches at the Naval Armory. Savoldi originally named Harris, BuBu Brasil, \"The South American Giant,\" but a promoter misprinted his first name as \"Bobo\" in an advertisement and it stuck.\n\nBrazil would have many matches with competitors such as Killer Kowalski, Dick the Bruiser, Johnny Valentine, and The Sheik, who feuded with Brazil over the course of several decades. These and other rivals would all fall victim to Brazil's finishing maneuver, the Coco Butt. Brazil also once wrestled Bill Miller to a draw, and challenged Bruno Sammartino for the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship in a battle of two top babyface competitors. On October 18, 1962, Brazil defeated \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers by hitting him in the groin causing Rogers to be unable to continue. Brazil refused the championship and they met a couple of weeks later and Rogers won. At the time the promoters were working a gimmick where the champ would be hit in the groin and the challenger wouldn't accept the title. The same scenario occurred in Toronto two weeks earlier with Bruno Sammartino and Rogers. Neither Brazil, nor Sammartino were officially recognized by the NWA as having won the World Heavyweight Championship. (This distinction is usually given to Ron Simmons, the first recognized African American world champion after winning the WCW World Heavyweight Championship).\n\nOn October 9, 1970, Brazil and El Mongol defeated Mr. Ito and The Great Ota in the first racially mixed match in Atlanta history.\n\nBrazil served as a mentor to wrestler \"Soulman\" Rocky Johnson. Brazil's manager was James Dudley, the first African American to be in charge of a major arena in the United States. Dudley would run to the ring waving a towel, as Brazil followed behind.\n\nBrazil retired in 1993 after a four-decade career. His last official match was in Chicago, Illinois against Kelly Kiniski, son of rival Gene Kiniski. Brazil was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame class of 1994 by Ernie Ladd. The following year, Brazil inducted Ladd into the WWF Hall of Fame.\n\nHarris had a wife and six children. After retiring from wrestling, he ran a restaurant called Bobo's Grill.\n\nHis son Karl wrestles as Bobo Brazil Jr. in the independent circuit. As of 2019 he still wrestles at 67 years old.\n\nHarris died on January 20, 1998, at the Lakeland Medical Center in St. Joseph, Michigan. He had been admitted to the hospital on January 14, after suffering a series of strokes.\n\n\n"}

Born in Cynthiana, Kentucky, he obtained a civil engineering degree from Colorado College in 1882 and a master's degree from the University of Virginia in 1886.\nIn the 1890s, working for the U.S. government in Alaska, he assembled the first iron steamship to be built in that territory. He also designed railroads in southwest Mexico, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela, and worked on the legendary Madeira-Mamoré Railway in Bolivia. In 1907, yellow fever forced him to return to the U.S. where he worked for John C. and Frederick Law Olmsted.\n\nIn 1912, he was hired as assistant engineer by George W. Perkins, chairman of the newly formed Palisades Interstate Park Commission (PIP), and in 1914, he was made chief engineer and general manager. Under his leadership, Bear Mountain State Park and Harriman State Park grew from an initial to . By 1919, it was estimated that a million people a year were coming to the park. In the early 1920s, Welch's engineering work gained nationwide attention when he built Storm King Highway into the sheer cliffs above the Hudson River north of Bear Mountain.\nWhen Welch started work on Bear Mountain State Park and Harriman State Park, there were no existing models or precedents to guide him. Welch organized a massive reforestation program, built 23 new lakes, a hundred miles of scenic drives and 103 children's camps, where 65,000 urban children enjoyed the outdoors each summer. He helped found the Palisades Interstate Park Trail Conference and served as chairman of the Appalachian Trail Conference.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America presented the Silver Buffalo Award to Welch in 1927 for his work in engineering and conservation.

After this, players #1 and #3 and players #2 and #4 played a best-of-five semifinal to determine the finalists while the remaining 64 players played three more games. The semifinals were followed by a best-of-five finals while the two other semifinalists played a best-of-five match to determine third and fourth place.\n\nThe first game of the finals looked like it would go Nyman's way when he bingoed with MUTAGENIC from an MU on his second play and then challenged off Wapnick's DOX. But Nyman later played a phony of his own (VERGINGS) and then got stuck with the Q while Wapnick drew both blanks and won by 38.\n\nIn game two, Wapnick drew both blanks again and won by almost 100 points, aided by the 102-point DYSURIC.\n\nGame three was tight until Nyman played two successive bingos and went on to a 530-victory. The fourth game again started close, until Wapnick scored 212 points on three successive turns (though he missed a 107-point bingo in the process) and took a seemingly insurmountable 174-point lead. A few turns later, Wapnick had the opportunity to take a 212 point lead with HELMING, but the play would have opened a triple-triple line with both blanks unseen so he opted for a more conservative 41-point play and still led by 170. Against the odds, Nyman came back with a 50-point X play and bingos with both blanks and went on to a devastating 9-point victory.\n\nThe key point in the final game came when Wapnick, holding a blank, played STUM instead of SMUR (of which he was unsure). Nyman then bingoed with BEDAWIN setting up an S-hook on the O column. Unable to play a bingo ending in S because of his STUM play, Wapnick instead played GROANERs when he could have blocked the O column with ORANGiER. Sure enough, Nyman drew an S and played VELURES for 91 points then coasted to an easy win to become the first non-North American to win the world championship.\n\n"}

{"id": "2228295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2228295", "title": "Sarbadars", "text": "Sarbadars\n\nThe Sarbadars (from \"sarbadār\", \"head on gallows\"; also known as Sarbedaran ) were a mixture of religious dervishes and secular rulers that came to rule over part of western Khurasan in the midst of the disintegration of the Mongol Ilkhanate in the mid-14th century (established in 1337). Centered in their capital of Sabzavar, they continued their reign until Khwaja 'Ali-yi Mu'ayyad submitted to Timur in 1381, and were one of the few groups that managed to mostly avoid Timur's famous brutality.\n\nThe Sarbadar state was marked by divisions in religious belief during its existence. Its rulers were Shi'i, though often Sunnis claimed leadership among the people with the support of Ilkhanid rulers. The leadership of the Shi'is stemmed chiefly from the charisma of Sheikh Khalifa; a scholar from Mazandaran, the shaikh had arrived in Khurasan some years before the founding of the Sarbadar state and was subsequently murdered by Sunnis. His successor, Hasan Juri, established the former's practices in the Sarbadar state. The followers of these practices were known as \"Sabzavaris\" after the city. The Sabzavaris, however, were divided; among their number were moderate Shi'is who were often at odds with the dervishes, adherents of a mystic ideology. The capital city of Sabzavar likely had a large Shi'ite community, but as the Sarbadars conquered the neighboring territory, they acquired cities with Sunni populations.\n\nThe Sarbadars are unique among the major contenders in post-Ilkhanid Persia in that none of their leaders ruled as legitimate sovereigns. None of them had a legitimate claim to the Ilkhanid throne, or were related to a Mongol or any other royal house, and none of them had previously held a high post within the Ilkhanate. While they on occasion recognized claimants to the Ilkhanid throne as their overlord, they did so purely as a matter of convenience, and in all other aspects they had no ties to the Ilkhanate. This fact had a strong influence regarding the nature of the Sarbadar political state.\n\nThe Sarbadars had a form of government which would, in modern times, probably be identified as an oligarchy or a republic. Unlike their neighbors, the Sarbadars had no dynastic lines; power usually went to the most ambitious. This view is not universally held, however. Some point to the fact that one of the Sarbadar rulers, Vajih al-Din Mas'ud, produced a son who also eventually reigned, named Lutf Allah. While seven other rulers separated the reign of Mas'ud and that of his son, those seven rulers are sometimes considered regents for Lutf Allah, until he was old enough to grab power for himself. Nevertheless, the seven are generally considered the heads of state in their own right.\n\nA ruler would hold power for as long as he could; the fact that several of them met violent deaths was a sign of the instability that plagued the state for most of its existence. The founder of the Sabadar state, 'Abd al-Razzaq, used the title of amir during his reign. While many of the Sarbadar leaders were secular, the dervishes also had their turns in power, and on occasion they ruled the state in co-dominion with each other; such partnerships, however, tended to fall apart quickly. Because the two sides held radically different views on how the Sarbadar government should be run, there were often drastic changes in policy as one side would supplant the other as the most powerful.\n\nThe Sarbadar state came into existence around early 1337. At that time, much of Khurasan was under the control of the Ilkhanid claimant Togha Temur and his amirs. One of his subjects, 'Ala' al-Din Muhammad, had jurisdiction over the city of Sabzavar. His oppressive taxation of the area caused an 'Abd al-Razzaq, a member of the feudal ruling class, to murder a government official in Bashtin, a district of the city. The official was a nephew of 'Ala' al-Din, and 'Abd al-Razzaq raised the standard of revolt. The rebels at first settled in the mountains, where they defeated militias sent against them and raided caravans and herds of cattle, and then in the summer of 1337 took possession of Sabzavar. Togha Temur was most likely campaigning in the west at this time, against the Jalayirids, making him unable to deal with the revolt. 'Abd al-Razzaq took the title of amir and had coins made in his name, but he was stabbed to death by his brother Vajih al-Din Mas'ud during an argument in 1338. Mas'ud, taking command of the Sarbadars, made peace with Togha Temur, promising to recognize him as sovereign and to pay taxes to him. The khan agreed, in the hope that it would put a stop to the Sarbadar raids on his supply trains.\n\nIn the meantime, Shaikh Kalifa's follower Hasan Juri had been preaching in towns all across Khurasan, with great success. His accomplishments attracted the suspicion of the government authorities, and in May 1336 he fled to eastern Iraq. When he returned some years later, Togha Temur's lieutenant and commander of the Ja'un-i Qurban Arghun Shah had him arrested in 1339 or 1340. He was eventually released, perhaps due to the insistence of Mas'ud, who soon after decided to take advantage of Hasan Juri's popularity. He joined Hasan's order as a novice, and had him proclaimed as joint ruler. Hasan Juri proclaimed that the Twelfth Imam would soon return. While the sharing of power began well, differences quickly emerged between the two. Mas'ud believed in accepting the nominal suzerainty of Togha Temur, while Hasan Juri was intent on establishing a Shi'i state. The two rulers each gained bases of support; the former had his family and the gentry, while the latter had the dervishes, the aristocracy, and the trade guilds. Both also had their own armed forces; Mas'ud had 12,000 armed peasants and a bodyguard of 700 Turkish slave troops, while Hasan Juri had an army composed of artisans and merchants.\n\nIn 1340 Mas'ud moved against the Ja'un-i Qurban under Arghun Shah; the latter was forced to abandon Nishapur and retreat to Tus. The Sarbadars continued to mint coins in Togha Temur's name, in the hope that he would ignore this move as he was campaigning in the west again at this time. The khan, however, moved against them; his forces were destroyed, and while fleeing to Mazandaran several important figures such as 'Ala' al-Din (formerly in charge of Sabzavar), 'Abd-Allah, and Togha's own brother 'Ali Ke'un were killed. The Sarbadars gained control of Jajarm, Damghan and Simnan, along with Togha's capital of Gurgan. Mas'ud and Hasan Juri, however, soon came into disagreement over several issues. Mas'ud, following the defeat of Togha Temur, gained a new suzerain in the form of Hasan Kucek of the Chobanids, as well as the latter's puppet khan Sulaiman. Mas'ud considered the move necessary; with the conquest of Simnan, the Chobanids were now neighbors. Since the Chobanids were Sunnis, however, this doubtless did not go over well with Mas'ud's co-ruler.\n\nWith the defeat of the Ja'un-i Qurban and Togha Temur, the Sarbadars still had one more force to contend with in Khurasan: the Kartids of Herat. Their leader Mu'izz al-Din Husain also recognized Togha Temur's overlordship, and when the Sarbadars threw off the khan's nominal rule, they became enemies. The Sarbadars decided to destroy the Kartids with an offensive campaign. The armies of the two forces met at the Battle of Zava on July 18, 1342. The battle started out well for the Sarbadars, but then Hasan Juri was taken and killed. His supporters, assuming (perhaps correctly) that his death had been the result of an assassin of Mas'ud, promptly retreated, turning the tide of the battle. The Kartids therefore survived. Following the return home, Mas'ud attempted to rule without the support of the dervishes, but his power was decreased. He attempted to end the threat of Togha Temur, who had in the meantime made his camp in the Amul region and was preventing the Sarbadars from staying in contact with the Chobanids. Mas'ud undertook a campaign against him in 1344 which got off to a good start, but ended in disaster. On the route from Sari to Amul, the Sarbadar army was trapped in a pincer movement, and Mas'ud was taken prisoner and executed. Most of the Sarbadar conquests were lost as a result of the two losses; only the region around Sabzavar, as well as maybe Juvain and Nishapur remained in their hands. Togha Temur returned to Gurgan and once again gained the allegiance of the Sarbadars.\n\nMas'ud's first three successors ruled for a period totaling only three years. Both of the first two men had served as his military commanders; Mas'ud's brother Shams al-Din came next, only to fall as well. These internal conflicts were countered by good news on the external front; namely, the death of Arghun Shah in 1343, and the rise of his successor Muhammad Beg, who abandoned the alliance of the Ja'un-i Qurban with Togha Temur in favor of one with the Sarbadars. Shams al-Din was replaced in turn by the dervish Shams al-Din 'Ali in 1347, marking the loss of power by Mas'ud's adherents. Shams al-Din 'Ali was an effective administrator, reorganizing the state finances, carrying out tax reforms, and paying officials in cash. As a religious man, he attempted to stamp out prostitution, drugs and alcohol, and lived a simple life. His military was effective; although he failed to take Tus, he was able to destroy a rebellion in Damghan in the west. He was, however, prevented from turning the Sarbadar state to the Shi'i creed by Mas'ud's supporters, who kept the government Sunni. In the meantime, he gained enemies among the opponents of the dervishes, as well as the corrupt officials of the state that hated his reforms. One of these officials named Haidar Qassab, who was possibly a member of the artisan guild, murdered him around 1352.\n\nShams al-Din 'Ali's successor was a member of the Sabzavari aristocracy named Yahya Karavi. Yahya was forced to deal with Togha Temur, who in spite of the loss of the allegiance of the Ja'un-i Qurban and, in 1349, the Kartids, still was a danger of the Sarbadars. His army of 50,000 dwarfed the Sarbadar army, which numbered only around 22,000. Yahya neutralized the khan by recognizing him as suzerain, striking coins in his name and paying taxes to him. He also promised to visit Togha Temur once a year. He was probably making one of these visits when he arrived in November or December 1353 at the khan's camp of Sultan-Duvin near Astarabad. Yahya and a group of his followers entered the camp and were allowed into Togha Temur's tent. There, they murdered the khan and his courtiers, then put to death the Mongol troops and killed the nomads' herds. With the death of Togha Temur, the last serious contender for the Ilkhanid throne was gone. The Sarbadar lands then expanded to the borders reached by Mas'ud, and then gained even more: the area around Ray, the city of Tus, and Astarabad and Shasman. Yahya, however, was murdered around 1356, possibly at the hands of Mas'ud's adherents. Mas'ud's son Lutf Allah was possibly involved in the murder.\n\nHaidar Qassib, the murderer of Shams al-Din 'Ali, now took advantage of the situation. Arriving from Astarabad, ostensibly to hunt down Yahya's killers, he installed Yahya's nephew Zahir al-Din Karavi to rule. Soon afterwards, however, he removed him from power and ruled in his own name. Unfortunately for him, he was unpopular with nearly everyone even before he came to power. As a former member of Shams al-Din 'Ali's party, the supporters of Mas'ud disliked him, and his murder of Shams al-Din 'Ali alienated him from the dervishes. Nasr Allah, Lutf Allah's tutor, allied with Yahya's murderers and rose in revolt in Isfara'in, the second city of the Sarbadars. Haidar moved to put the rebellion down, but before he could he was stabbed to death by an assassin hired by a Hasan Damghani. Lutf Allah now gained control of the state, but he soon came into conflict with Hasan Damghani as well. He was defeated, and in the process Mas'ud's adherents were mostly eliminated.\n\nHasan Damghani was now forced to deal with Amir Vali, who was a son of the former governor of Astarabad before its conquest by the Sarbadars. Amir Vali had taken advantage of Haidar Qassib's move out of Astarabad to return to the city. Amir Vali then claimed to be acting in the name of Luqman, the son of Togha Temur, although he never handed power over to him. Hasan sent two expeditions against him, both of which ended in failure; he himself led a third force, but met no more success, allowing Amir Vali to be in a position to gain more Sarbadar territory. Meanwhile, in the east a radical Shi'i named Darvish 'Aziz revolted and established a theocratic state in Mashhad in the name of the Twelfth Imam. Darvish 'Aziz gained more territory with his conquest of Tus. Hasan recognized that the entire Sarbadar state was in jeopardy: the Sabzavari dervishes might declare their support for the theocratic state at any time. He moved against Darvish 'Aziz, defeated him and destroyed the Mahdist state; Darvish 'Aziz went to Isfahan in exile. Soon afterward, however, an 'Ali-yi Mu'ayyad rose in revolt in Damghan and gained the support of Hasan's enemies. He recalled Darvish 'Aziz from exile and joined his order. While Hasan was besieging the castle of Shaqqan, near Jajarm, 'Ali-yi Mu'ayyad captured Sabzavar around 1361. In the process, he captured the possessions and families of many of Hasan's followers. When he demanded Hasan's head, they therefore complied.\n\n'Ali-yi Mu'ayyad enjoyed, by far, the longest reign out of all the Sarbadar rulers. The partnership with Darvish 'Aziz lasted for ten months; while 'Ali-yi Mu'ayyad, who was Shi'i, helped raised Shi'ism to the state religion, he opposed several of Darvish 'Aziz's theocratic ideas. Tensions were high when a campaign was begun against the Kartids of Herat. Even before they had met any resistance, the Sarbadar army erupted in violence. While on the march, 'Ali's men picked a quarrel with the dervishes; Darvish 'Aziz and many of his followers were killed trying to escape. 'Ali returned and attempted to destroy the power of the dervishes completely. He moved against their organization and forced them out of Sabzavar, and even destroyed the graves of Shaikh Khalifa and Hasan Juri. The dervishes, however, fled, being granted refuge by the Kartids, the Ja'un-i Qurban, and the Muzaffarids of Shiraz. Meanwhile, the Ja'un-i Qurban regained Tus, though the two sides seemed to have no further conflict. Amir Vali gained control of Simnan and Bistam, though Astarabad was temporarily reconquered by the Sarbadars (1365/6-1368/9. Administratively, 'Ali increased the quality of the coinage, and instituted tax reforms.\n\nIn 1370 Mu'izz al-Din Husain of the Kartids died, to be succeeded by his sons Ghiyas al-Din Pir 'Ali and Malik Muhammad. Pir 'Ali, a grandson of Togha Temur by his mother Sultan Khatun, considered the Sarbadars his enemy, and used the emigrant Sabzavaris in his realm to stir up discontent against Ali-yi Mu'ayyad. The latter responded by supporting Malik Muhammad, who ruled a small part of the Kartid lands from Sarakhs. Pir 'Ali then moved against his stepbrother, but Ali-yi Mu'ayyad stopped him by a flanking attack after overcoming one of Pir 'Ali's castles near the border, whose commanders were Sabzavaris. Pir 'Ali was forced to come to terms with his stepbrother. The fighting with the Sabadars, however, continued, and 'Ali was forced to throw his forces to defend Nishapur, leaving the western part of his lands exposed. At the same time, he made a hostile enemy out of Shah Shuja of the Muzaffarids. A revolt in 1373 in Kirman against Shah Shuja led by Pahlavan Asad received military support from 'Ali, but the rebellion was defeated in December 1374. The dervishes in Shiraz, meanwhile, found a leader in Rukn al-Din, a former member of Darvish 'Aziz's order. Shah Shuja gave them money and arms, and they conquered Sabzavar around 1376, forcing 'Ali to flee to Amir Vali. At about the same time, Nishapur was conquered by the Kartids of Pir 'Ali.\n\nThe new government in Sabzavar established a Shi'i rule based on the teachings of Hasan Juri. Not long afterward, however, Amir Vali arrived before the city. His group included Ali-yi Mu'ayyad, as well as the Muzaffarid Shah Mansur. 'Ali was reinstated as Sarbadar ruler once the city was captured, but many of his reforms had been abandoned. The partnership with Amir Vali furthermore did not last, and in 1381 the latter was besieging Sabzavar again. 'Ali, believing he had little other choice, asked for the assistance of Timur the Lame. He submitted to the conqueror in Nishapur, and Timur responded by ravaging Amir Vali's lands in Gurgan and Mazandaran. In Radkan, as he was returning from the victorious campaign, he confirmed 'Ali as governor of Sabzavar.\n\n'Ali remained loyal to Timur, dying in 1386 after being wounded during Timur's campaign in Lesser Luristan. As a reward for this loyalty, Timur never occupied Sabzavar with his own troops, and allowed 'Ali to retain his local administration. After 'Ali's death, the Sarbadar territories were split amongst his relatives, who mostly remained loyal to Timur as well and took part in his campaigns. Muluk Sabzavari did become involved with the revolt of Hajji Beg of the Ja'un-i Qurban (which had been forcibly submitted to Timur's rule around 1381) in Tus in 1389, and afterwards sought refuge with the Muzaffarid Shah Mansur in Isfahan, but was eventually pardoned by Timur and given the governorship of Basra near the end of 1393. That same year, following the conquest of Baghdad by Timur, the governorship of that city was given to 'Ali's nephew Khwaja Mas'ud Sabzavari, who had a force of 3,000 Sarbadars. Despite this, he was forced to retreat in 1394 when Sultan Ahmad of the Jalayirids marched to recapture the city, and he retreated to Shushtar. Following the death of Timur, the Sarbadars slowly fell out of prominence.\n\nHistorically, the Sarbadars have been considered a robber-state; they have been accused of being a group of religious fanatics who terrorized their neighbors, with little regard for legitimate rule. Considering the conduct of nearly all of the Persian states during this time period, this assessment seems needlessly harsh. Other historians have considered the Sarbadars to be an example of class struggle; the downtrodden rising up against oppressive taxation by their masters, and establishing a republic in the middle of several feudal states. This, however, is not entirely accurate either. 'Abd al-Razzaq was a member of the ruling class, which was taxed the heaviest at the time. It could however be said that it was definitely a struggle of a people with a certain belief system against an oppressive ruler desiring to establish what could be easily be labelled a republic. Religious orders were common in this period of Persian history, as the order of the Ilkhanate fell apart, to be replaced by a period of anarchy and incessant warfare. Aside from the Safavid dynasty of Persia in the 16th century, the Sarbadars were probably the most successful example of such orders, although they rarely managed to achieve the state that they so desired.\n\nThe Sarbadars had an indirect on northern Iran, where several Shi'i attempts to gain power locally were launched:\n\nMazandaran: During Shams al-Din 'Ali's reign, a supporter of Hasan Juri named 'Izz al-Din, with a group of fellow adherents, returned to his homeland in Mazandaran. They were apparently unable to accept the moderate tone taken by the Sabadars in Sabzavar. 'Izz al-Din died en route, leaving his son Sayyid Qivan al-Din (also known as Mir-i Buzurg) to lead the group. They arrived in Amul and set up a state together with Kiya Afrasiyab, a son of a Hasan Chulabi, who had destroyed the local Bavand dynasty in 1349. Like the Sarbadars, conflict soon erupted in this state between the secular rulers and the dervishes; the latter eventually won. Destroyed in 1392 by Timur, it emerged once more after his death, but only for a brief time.\n\nGilan: In Gilan, in northwestern Persia, a group of Shi'i shaikhs received help from the Mazandarani dervishes, and gained control of the region under Shaikh Amir Kiya. Due to the region's relative obscurity, the state survived until 1592, when it was absorbed by the Safavid Persians.\n\nSamarkand: A group of \"sarbadars\" (it is not known whether they actually called themselves that) was instrumental of the defeat of the khan of Moghulistan (the Eastern Chagatai Khanate), Ilyas Khoja, during his invasion of the Western Chagatai Khanate in 1365. The sarbadars of Samarkand closed the gates of the city and refused to open them for the invader. They withstood the subsequent siege and organized ambushes on the enemy until an epidemic began striking down the Moghul horses, forcing them to retreat. Shortly afterwards, an early ally of Timur, Husayn, forced his way into Samarkand and put most of the sarbadar leaders to death. Despite being a nomad, Timur decided to court the assistance of the sedentary sarbadars following the breakdown of the alliance with Husayn, and they were an important factor in his rise to power in the Chagatai horde.\n\n\n\n"}

Ten candidates were elected in Winnipeg, while every other constituency returned members by instant runoff voting.\n\nThe result was a second consecutive victory for the Progressive Party of Manitoba, which was supported by the United Farmers of Manitoba. The Progressives, led by Premier John Bracken, won twenty-nine seats out of fifty-five to win their second majority government. During the campaign, the Progressives stressed that they were not a party in the traditional sense and promised \"A business (not a party) government\". Many Progressive candidates simply described themselves as Bracken supporters.\n\nThe Conservatives won fifteen seats under the leadership of Fawcett Taylor, an improvement from seven in the election of 1922. This election re-established the Conservatives as the leading opposition party in Manitoba, and made the party a credible challenger for government in the next election.\n\nThe Manitoba Liberal Party was unable to regain the support it lost to the Progressive Party in the previous election. The Liberals won seven seats under the new leadership of Hugh Robson, down one from their 1922 total. After the election, many senior Liberals began to work for an electoral alliance with the Progressives. Robson, who opposed this plan, was persuaded to resign as leader in 1930. The alliance was formalized in 1932.\n\nThe Independent Labour Party fell to three seats, down from six in the previous election.

In the case of an automobile, WOT is when the accelerator is depressed fully, sometimes referred to as \"flooring it.\"\n\nIn the case of a diesel engine, which does not have a throttle valve, WOT is the point at which the maximum amount of fuel is being injected relative to the amount of air pumped by the engine, generally in order to bring the fuel-air mixture up to the stoichiometric point. If any more fuel were to be injected then black smoke would result.\n\nAt wide open throttle, manifold vacuum decreases. The higher manifold pressure in turn allows more air to enter the combustion cylinders, and thus additional fuel is required to balance the combustion reaction. The additional air and fuel reacting together produce more power. \n"}
{"id": "2228306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2228306", "title": "Jivanmukta", "text": "Jivanmukta\n\nA jivan mukta or mukta is someone who, in the Advaita Vedanta philosophy of Hinduism, has gained and assimilated infinite and divine knowledge and power and gained complete self-knowledge and self-realisation and attained \"kaivalya\" or \"moksha\" (enlightenment and liberation ), thus is liberated with an inner sense of freedom while living and not yet died. The state is the aim of \"moksh\"a in Advaita Vedanta, Yoga and other schools of Hinduism, and it is referred to as \"Jivanmukti\" (Liberation or Enlightenment).\n\nA \"Jivanmukti\" is also called \"atma-jnani\" (self-realized) because they are the knowers of their true self (\"atman\") and the universal self hence also called as \"Brahma-Jnani\". At the end of their lives, \"jivanmuktas\" destroy remaining \"karmas\" and attains Paramukti (final liberation) and becomes Paramukta. When a \"Jivanmukti\" gives his insight to others and teach them about his realisation of the true nature of the ultimate reality (Brahman) and self (\"Atman\") and takes the role of a guru to show the path of Moksha to others, then that \"jivanmukta\" is called as \"Avadhuta\" and some \"Avadhutas\" also achieves the title of \"Paramhamsa\". When a \"Rishi\" (Seer sage) becomes a \"Jivanmukta\" then that \"rishi\" is called Brahmarshi.\n\nSome of the examples of Jivan Mukta are Mahavira, Buddha, Adi Shankaracharya, Saint Dnyaneshwar, Kabirdas, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Ramakrishna Paramahansa, Ramana Maharshi, Vishwamitra, etc. They realized Self (\"atman\") i.e. God within their lifetime by travelling the path of pure Spirituality. They reached the stage of Enlightenment, Self-Realization, God-Realization, Jivan-mukti, Atma-jnana(all words are synonyms). They have negated the karma to zero, to reach the state of Jivan-Mukta. After gaining enlightenment, they retained their body, to disseminate the Jnana to masses. After leaving the body, they attained the Paramukti.\n\n\"Jivanmukta\" (जीवन्मुक्त) is an adjective derived from a combination of Sanskrit noun जीव \"jiva\", \"life\", and the past participle of the verb मुच् (much, or IAST muc), \"to liberate\". Monier-Williams gives the meaning \"emancipated while still alive\".\n\n\"Jivanmukti\" (जीवन्मुक्ति), the corresponding abstract noun means, \"liberation during life, liberation before death\", or \"emancipation while still alive\". This is the only meaning given in authoritative dictionaries of classical Sanskrit, including Monier-Williams. \nOther translations, not found in standard dictionaries and therefore presumably of more modern date, include \"self realization\", \"living liberation\", \"enlightenment\", \"liberated soul\", or \"self liberation\".\n\nThe various texts and schools of Hinduism describe \"Jivanmukti\" state of existence as one of liberation and freedom reached within one's life. Some contrast \"jivanmukti\" with \"videhamukti\" (moksha from samsara after death). Jivanmukti is a state that transforms the nature, attributes and behaviors of an individual, claim these ancient texts of Hindu philosophy. For example, according to Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad, the enlightened individual shows attributes such as:\n\nAdi Shankara explains that nothing can induce one to act who has no desire of his own to satisfy. The supreme limit of vairagya (\"detachment\"), is the non-springing of \"vasanas\" in respect of enjoyable objects; the non-springing of the sense of the \"I\" (in things which are the \"ānatman\") is the extreme limit of \"bodha\" (\"awakening\"), and the non-springing again of the modifications which have ceased is the extreme limit of \"Uparati\" (\"abstinence\"). The Jivanmukta gains divine and infinite knowledge and has complete self-knowledge and Self-realization, a Jivanmukta by reason of his ever being Brahman, is freed from awareness of external objects and no longer aware of any difference between the inner atman and Brahman and between Brahman and the world, he knows the he is same as Brahman and has an ever experiencing infinite consciousness. \"\"Vijnatabrahmatattvasya yathapurvam na samsrtih\"\" – \"there is no saṃsāra as before for one who has known Brahman\".\n\nThere are three kinds of \"prarabdha karma\": \"Ichha\" (\"personally desired\"), \"Anichha\" (\"without desire\") and \"Parechha\" (\"due to others' desire\"). For a self realized person, a Jivanamukta, there is no \"Ichha-Prarabdha\" but the two others, \"Anichha\" and \"Parechha\", remain, which even a jivanmukta has to undergo. According to the Advaita school, for those of wisdom \"Prarabdha\" is liquidated only by experience of its effects; \"Sancita\" (\"accumulated karmas\") and \"Agami\" (\"future karmas\") are destroyed in the fire of \"Jnana\" (\"knowledge\").\n\nThe term Paramukti is commonly used to refer to final liberation, which occurs upon the death of the body of someone who has attained Jivanmukti or Kaivalya during his or her lifetime. It implies the ultimate release of the soul (atman) from the Saṃsāra and karma and merger of the atman in Brahman, so when a Jivanmukta dies he becomes a Paramukta. In the Hindu view, when an ordinary person dies and his physical body disintegrates, the person's unresolved karma causes his atman to pass on to a new birth; and thus the karmic inheritance is reborn in one of the many realms of samsara. However, when a person attains Jivanmukti, he is liberated from karmic rebirth. When such a person dies and his physical body disintegrates, his cycle of rebirthing ends and he become one with Brahman, then that person is said to have achieved Paramukti and became a Paramukta, so, a Jivanmukta has a body while a Paramukta is bodyless and pure. When a Jivanmukta attains the state of Nirvikalpa Samadhi then he or she can become a Paramukta by his or her own will. A Jivanmukta who has attained the state of nirvikalpa samadhi, will, at an appropriate time, consciously exit from their body and attains Paramukti. This act of consciously and intentionally leaving one's body is called as Mahasamadhi.\n\nIn the \"śramaṇic\" traditions, the jivanmukta is called an \"arhat\" in Buddhism and \"arihant\" in Jainism.\n\nThe Advaita school holds the view that the world appearance is owing to \"avidya\" (ignorance) that has the power to project i.e. to superimpose the unreal on the real (adhyasa), and also the power to conceal the real resulting in the delusion of the Jiva who experiences objects created by his mind and sees difference in this world, he sees difference between the ātman (\"the individual self\") and Brahman (\"the supreme Self\"). This delusion caused by ignorance is destroyed when ignorance itself is destroyed by knowledge. When all delusion is removed there remains no awareness of difference. He who sees no difference between Self and Brahman is said to be a Jivanmukta. Jivanmukta experience infinite knowledge, infinite power and infinite bliss while alive and also after death i.e., after becoming Paramukta, while Videhmukta experiences these only after death.\nThere are four stages for becoming a Jivanmukta:–\n\n1. Sālokya – living in the same world.\n\n2. Sārūpya – having the same form\n\n3. Sāmīpya – being close to\n\n4. Sāyujya – merging into.\n\nSTAGE 1. The first stage is called sālokya — corresponding to the waking state of consciousness (jāgrata) — the realization that the entire vast universe of billions of galaxies and universes is all pervaded by the Divine Consciousness. (Viṣṇu means That which pervades the entire universe and everything in it.) It is the undifferentiated Ocean of Being.\nWhen this stage is achieved then the person gets the freedom from the idea that the world is separate and independent from us and is an ultimate source of abiding pleasure and joy.\n\nSTAGE 2. The second stage is sarūpya or sadhārmya — corresponding to the dreaming state of consciousness – realization that every being is interconnected and all \"apparently\" separate jivas are embodiments of the One Divine Consciousness. When this stage is achieved then the person gets the freedom from ahaṅkāra - the notion of self-identity and the notion of difference and the other, thus being able to cultivate empathy with all and universal compassion for all beings.\n\nSTAGE 3. The third stage samīpya — is intimacy with the Divine — corresponding to the unconscious dreamless state of consciousness – God-realization occurs when the nature of the saguṇa īśvara is cognized and one surrenders to Him/Her. When this stage is achieved then the person gets the freedom from all self-effort to achieve liberation, freedom from religion and its bondage and the relinquishing of all self-imposed burdens – achieving a state of equanimity, tranquility, abiding joy and peace.\n\nSTAGE 4. The final stage sāyujya — communion with, or unification with the Absolute Godhead — corresponding to the Turiya or inconceivable and inexpressible fourth state of consciousness – a merging with the Godhead bordering on complete identity.\nWhen this stage is achieved then the person becomes a complete Jivanmukta and gets the absolute freedom from rebirth and suffering —this is the final stage of Brahma-nirvāna.\n\nThe Advaita philosophy rests on the premise that noumenally the Absolute alone exists, Nature, Souls and God are all merged in the Absolute; the Universe is one, that there is no difference within it, or without it; Brahman is alike throughout its structure, and the knowledge of any part of it is the knowledge of the whole (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad II.4.6-14), and, since all causation is ultimately due to Brahman, since everything beside Brahman is an appearance, the Atman is the only entity that exists and nothing else. All elements emanated from the Atman (Taittiriya Upanishad II.1) and all existence is based on Intellect (Aitareya Upanishad III.3). The universe created by Brahman from a part of itself is thrown out and re-absorbed by the Immutable Brahman (Mundaka Upanishad I.1.7). Therefore, the Jiva (the individual self) is non-different from Brahman (the supreme Self), and the Jiva, never bound, is ever liberated. Through Self-consciousness one gains the knowledge of existence and realizes Brahman.\n"}

The presumed grievances brought about the uprising known as Bacon's Rebellion. This Rebellion was regarded as the first of the new colonies. Whether Bacon's Rebellion was serving the interest of the colonists, or the King, continues to be debated. The Declaration and the Rebellion as a whole was a long time coming and was the result of a crisis within Virginia's social, economic, and political problems. \n\nThe Declaration authored by Bacon cited eight points in its complaint against the governor:\n\n\nNathaniel Bacon accused Sir William Berkeley of being guilty of going against the King's interests: \"we accuse Sir William Berkeley as guilty of each and every one of the same, and as one who has traitorously attempted, violated, and injured his Majesty’s interest here by a loss of a great part of this his colony and many of his faithful loyal subjects\"\n\nThe Declaration listed a number of the governor's associates said to be \"his wicked and pernicious councilors, confederates, aiders, and assisters against the commonalty in these our civil commotions.\"\n\nNames listed included Sir Henry Chichley, William Claiburne Junior, Lieut.

He contended that those named had been enemies of the people of Virginia and of the King and English royalty. Bacon and his Rebellion felt that before they were to attack and cause an uprising against Sir Berkeley's administration, a treaty would be in order to give the administration a chance to surrender.\n\nBacon demanded that Sir William Berkeley and all persons listed turn themselves in within four days of the notice. Bacon continues with \"whatsoever place, house, or ship, any of the said persons shall reside, be hid, or protected, we declare the owners, masters, or inhabitants of the said places to be confederates and traitors to the people and the estates of them is also of all the aforesaid persons to be confiscated.\"\n\nNathaniel Bacon then called on the citizens of the state to seize the people mentioned in the declaration by the command of the king.\n\n\"These are therefore in his majesties name to command you forthwith to seize the persons above mentioned as Trayters to the King and Country and them to bring to Midle plantacon, and there to secure them untill further order, and in case of opposition, if you want any further assistance you are forthwith to demand itt in the name of the people in all the Counties of Virginia.\"\n\nThe Declaration was signed \"Nathaniel Bacon, General by Consent of the people.\"\n\n"}

Dorman won the case\n\nOne of the most popular petrol engines was the 1½-litre four-cylinder Type 4ED engine (following their less powerful 4EB and 4EC engines, used by several makers in the pre 1931 period), widely used by Frazer Nash and Lea-Francis during the 1920s and 30s, and in the H.R.G. light car from 1936 to 1939 which was sold with a guaranteed top speed of 90 mph. Another successful product, the 4½-litre 6-cylinder engine is best remembered as the power unit for Invicta and Lagonda cars.\n\nMeadows also produced marine engines after a visit from Hubert Scott-Paine in 1931 who was looking for some better engines for his prototype seaplane tender (RAF200) which was fitted at that time with Brooks engines. After some modification to allow the engines to be angled at 17 degrees, the British Power Boat Company selected Meadows 6-cylinder petrol engines for the high-speed seaplane tenders, each having two engines rated at 100 bhp, and being capable of 29 knots.\n\nIn the 1930s Meadows developed a flat-12 type-MAT/1 engine of 8858cc for military applications including the Tetrarch Light Tank. Later they built a 16litre 300 bhp flat-12 type-DAV petrol engine used in the Covenanter tank This engine was also used in the prototype A20 tank, although this weighed more than twice the Covenanter and so was considered underpowered. The later, and widely used, A22 Churchill tank was a development of the A20. Partly to provide more power, and also to improve production time, this was instead powered by a Vauxhall flat-12 engine termed the \"Twin-Six\", as it was based on two pre-existing Bedford six-cylinder lorry engines. This engine was slightly more powerful, but only to a rated 350 bhp. The Guy Armoured Car, made in 1939–1940, used the Meadows 4-cylinder 4-ELA petrol engine.\n\nMeadows also made the 600 bhp Rolls-Royce Meteor V-12 petrol tank engine from 1944. This came about because Rolls-Royce Merlin engines came under the Ministry of Aircraft Production, but tank engines came under the Ministry of Supply, and the huge demand for the Merlin engine was causing Meteor production to falter and this was in turn affecting Cromwell tank production. Meadows was already involved with the Ministry of Supply, so they were brought in from 1944 to manufacture Meteor engines to cover the shortfall. The Rover Company also produced Meteor engines in this period.\n\nMeadows started developing diesel engines in the 1930s, and a 5-litre 4-cylinder diesel developing 75 bhp at 2000rpm was launched at the 1935 Olympia Motor Transport Show. They introduced a 6-cylinder 100 bhp version in 1938. Both of these engines used a Lanova combustion chamber design, CAV injector pumps, and they were listed both for road transport and marine use. In 1938 they supplied diesel engines for the New Zealand Railways Standard class railcars.\n\nAfter World War II they resumed making diesel engines, but with a completely new design this time with direct injection and toroidal cavity pistons. The 6.9 litre 4-cylinder unit gave 85 bhp at 1800rpm, and the 10.35 litre 6-cylinder unit developed 150 bhp at 1800rpm. These were aimed at both vehicle, marine, and stationary markets, and there was a horizontal version of the 6-cylinder unit for flat underfloor mounting. The same two engines were rated at 60 and 90 bhp for continuous marine use at 1600rpm, and a larger engine of similar design rated at 130 bhp and of 15.5 litres capacity was also listed. One of the unusual features of these engines is the ability to swap the utilities from side to side and from end to end, which also allows for making handed-engines for twin-engined marine craft. For marine use helical reduction gears of different ratios, and epicyclic reversing gears were also available. Many engines were supplied to their neighbour in Fallings Park, Guy Motors for use in their buses and trucks. A small number of diesel engines was supplied for British Rail Railbuses in 1958. They also powered the Fowler Challenger crawler tractors, the 6DC-630 in the Mk III, and the 6DJ-970 in the Mk IV. Meadows adverts show they were also used in plant like rock-crushers, ditch diggers, compressors and other equipment used in road building. They were also used to power military FV2502 27.5kVA generator sets.\n\nEngine Models (list incomplete), the letter after the 'D' varies according to application (e.g. M = marine) :\n\nMeadows had started by making gearboxes in 1920, initially for lorries made by the Vulcan Motor & Engineering Co and then Coventry Climax Ltd. After engines were introduced in 1922 they sold complete engine, clutch, and gearbox packages, initially with either 3 or 4 speed gearboxes, and later with 4 or 5 speed gearboxes. During the early 1950s, Meadows supplied gearboxes for the Jowett Javelin car.\n\nThey were also responsible for making the Meadows Frisky microcar between 1957 and 1961.\n\nIn 1965, Henry Meadows was purchased by Jaguar.\n\n"}

When it opened in 1997, it was the tallest roller coaster in the world, and its speed of was tied for the fastest with Tower of Terror II, a similar roller coaster which opened two months earlier at Dreamworld in Australia. These two coasters were the first to utilize Linear Synchronous Motor (LSM) technology to propel vehicles to top speed. As of January 2020, it is the only reverse freefall coaster left in operation since the closure of Tower of Terror II in November of 2019.\n\nThe park originally intended to open the ride in 1996, but the opening was delayed because of several issues with the launch system. The ride was closed in late 2010 for refurbishment, and it emerged in 2011 as \"Superman: Escape from Krypton\". The refurbished ride featured new trains which face backward, speeds of up to , and it was painted with a new color scheme. As of 2013, Superman: Escape from Krypton has the third-tallest structure, the fifth-fastest speed and the third-longest drop of any roller coaster in the world.\n\nWhile in the planning stages, the ride was going to be named \"Velocetron\" and themed as The Man of Steel. The ride was announced on January 5, 1996 as Superman: The Escape, breaking records as the first roller coaster to reach , passing Desperado and Phantom's Revenge at . The ride was designed by Intamin, a Swiss roller coaster firm. It was originally intended to open on June 1, 1996. However, due to a range of problems with the launch system, its opening was delayed. In late 1996, there was a preview for season pass holders. After 10 months of testing and reengineering, the ride opened on March 15, 1997. After its opening, the media claimed Superman to be the fastest roller coaster in the world. However, since it was delayed, a similar roller coaster known as Tower of Terror, which also has a , had opened about a month earlier at Dreamworld in Australia. Superman therefore lost its claim as being the first roller coaster to reach , although it was then tied with Tower of Terror as the fastest roller coaster in the world. However, the ride became the first roller coaster in the world to go over 400 ft, therefore becoming the tallest roller coaster in the world at the time.\nIn June 2004, Superman: The Escape's seat belts were modified because of an incident on the Superman – Ride of Steel roller coaster at Six Flags New England. California State Regulators asked the park to make modifications to the rides' restraint systems to prevent a similar incident in the future.\n\nJust after July 4 weekend of 2010, Superman: The Escape ceased operations with no reason given. A sign posted in front of the ride indicated that it would not reopen until the 2011 season, with hints that there would be improvements made to the ride experience. After Superman: The Escape's sister ride, the Tower of Terror II at Dreamworld, underwent a major refurbishment in 2010 which entailed a new vehicle which launches backward, speculation turned to the possibility of a similar modification to the Magic Mountain ride. Six Flags Magic Mountain officials quickly denied rumors that it would receive a Bizarro retheming, similar to roller coasters at other Six Flags parks.\n\nOn October 20, 2010, Six Flags Magic Mountain officially announced the refurbishment and re-theming of Superman: The Escape, in addition to the construction of two new roller coasters. As part of the refurbishment, the ride was renamed to Superman: Escape from Krypton and featured new backward launching cars and a new color scheme. The upgraded ride reopened to the public on March 19, 2011.\n\nSuperman: Escape from Krypton closed again on February 5, 2012 (almost a year after the refurbishment), to prepare for the new 2012 attraction . Two drop towers, also built by Intamin, were integrated into the existing sides of Superman: Escape from Krypton's structure. The ride reopened when construction was finished on July 7, 2012.\n\nTo enable the construction of the park's 2013 roller coaster, Full Throttle, Superman: Escape from Krypton was temporarily closed from December 2012. It reopened in mid-January with Six Flags Magic Mountain stating the ride may have intermittent closures as the construction of Full Throttle continued.\n\nAt the entrance to the ride, the Superman \"S\" shield is imprinted and now painted onto the ground. The entrance area and queue are modeled after the Fortress of Solitude, Superman's headquarters. The station is lit green, modeled as Krypton, the planet that is full of Kryptonite rock that can take away Superman's powers. Inside is a crystalline-looking environment which recreates Superman's fortress in the Arctic. If the Velocetron name had been chosen, the queue and station would have had ancient ruins and a giant laser. A page on display in the Sky Tower, the park's observation tower, shows the concept art for Velocetron.\n\nThe roller coaster has two parallel tracks, which are identical. The vehicle is accelerated by Linear Synchronous Motors in reverse out of the station from 0 to in approximately 7 seconds. Riders experience a g-force of 4.5 during the launch. The vehicle then climbs up at a 90 degree angle. Riders climb this vertical section facing directly downward, before slightly stopping near the top of the tower. During the vertical section of the ride, riders experience weightlessness for about 6.5 seconds. The vehicle drops and is slowed down before re-entering the station.\n\nThe roller coaster originally featured two vehicles, each with three rows of four seats and one row of three seats for a total of 15 riders per vehicle. Both vehicles were built to only run forward. After the ride was refurbished in 2010, new \"streamlined\" vehicles with the Superman logo were introduced. The new vehicles were designed with low-profile sides to enhance the open-air feeling. Although they are wider, the row of the three seats in the older vehicle was reduced to two, resulting in a lower total of 14 riders per vehicle. Both of the new trains were configured to run backwards, though they were designed to run forward as well. It was reported that the park would eventually run one side forward to give riders a choice, but both trains have remained facing backward.\n\nThe steel track is approximately in length and the height of the tower is approximately . The tower is in an \"L\" shape with two parallel tracks. When the ride opened, the entire structure was painted white. After the ride was refurbished, the top third of the structure was painted red, the track was painted yellow and the rest was painted blue.\n\nFor the first four years of operation, Superman: Escape from Krypton was tied with Tower of Terror II as the fastest roller coaster in the world. In 2001, the speed record was taken by Dodonpa in Japan which features a top speed of . Superman: Escape from Krypton held the record for the tallest roller coaster in the world until 2003 when the record was taken by the Top Thrill Dragster at Cedar Point. , it has the fifth fastest speed, the third tallest structure and the third-highest drop in the world.\n\n"}

The law school is located in Arlington, roughly fifteen miles east-northeast of the university's main campus in Fairfax.\n\nU.S. News & World Report ranks the school 45th among American law schools, and it is the 3rd-highest-ranked law school in the Washington metropolitan area, behind Georgetown University Law Center and George Washington University Law School. As of 2017, the school had 525 students in its J.D., LL.M., JD/MBA, and JD/MPP programs. The median LSAT score among incoming J.D. students in 2018 was 163 and the median GPA was 3.76. The passage rate for first-time takers of the Virginia bar exam in July 2017 was 80.33%, fifth among Virginia's eight law schools.\n\nOn March 31, 2016, the Board of Visitors approved renaming the school after the late United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. The name change followed gifts of $20 million from an anonymous donor, and an additional $10 million from the Charles Koch Foundation conditioned on the renaming, and was announced as requiring approval by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia. The initial name, the Antonin Scalia School of Law, was changed to the current name after controversy over the acronym. The name change became effective on May 17, 2016.\n\n\nGeorge Mason University School of Law was authorized by the Virginia General Assembly in March 1979 and was founded on July 1, 1979. The school had started as the \"International School of Law\" (ISL), which opened in 1972 in a classroom at the Federal Bar Building on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC. In 1973, it moved into the home of former United States Chief Justice Edward Douglass White on Rhode Island Avenue, and in 1975 purchased the old Kann's Department Store in Arlington. Despite growth, ISL could never obtain accreditation. In 1976, it discussed a merger with George Mason University, which was interested in setting up a law school. In 1978, the Virginia State Council of Education denied GMU's proposal to start a law school and encouraged a merger with ISL instead. Later that year, the Council advised against allowing that merger, but the Virginia state legislature nonetheless approved the merger in early March 1979.\n\nThe school became fully accredited by the American Bar Association in 1986, but was still not widely known during the late 1980s. Since then, however, its rankings have risen rapidly.\n\nThe total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) for the 2017-18 academic year at Mason Law is $49,219 for in-state students attending full-time; the total cost of attendance for non-resident students attending full-time is $64,605. The Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years is $179,567 for residents, and $234,586 for non-residents. To combat the high cost of law school, George Mason's Board of Visitors voted in 2013 to freeze tuition through the 2016-2017 academic year.\n\nMason Law is somewhat distinctive in offering a wide variety of intense law tracks, each of which requires that approximately one-third of the credits for graduation be completed in the track, and law concentrations, which are elective specializations and have a less restrictive credit requirement as compared to the track program. The law tracks include Litigation Law, Patent Law, and Regulatory Law.\n\nThe law concentrations include Antitrust Law, Communications Law, Corporate and Securities Law, Criminal Law, Homeland & National Security Law, Immigration Law, Intellectual Property Law, International Business Law, Legal and Economic Theory, Litigation Law, Personal Law, Regulatory Law, Tax Law, and Technology Law.\n\nAlso, the school has a Legal Research, Writing and Analysis (LRWA) curriculum. Mason Law requires its students to complete four semesters (two years) of LRWA coursework. Students acquire the necessary skills for trial and appellate practice. The first-year LRWA curriculum is taught by third-year (and fourth-year evening) law students under the guidance of full-time faculty. During the first semester, students learn how to conduct legal research and write a predictive memorandum, while during the second semester, students compete in intramural oral arguments while producing both predictive and persuasive memoranda. The second year of LRWA is taught by legal practitioners, and consists of Appellate Writing and Legal Drafting. Student transcripts bear a separate grade-point average (GPA) for LRWA and writing-intensive coursework in addition to the overall GPA. Students must successfully complete 89 credits to graduate.\n\nIn addition to two semesters (5 credits total) of LRWA, the first-year curriculum is filled with foundation courses. First-year day students cover the following legal foundation courses: Torts (4 credits), Contracts (5 credits), Property (4 credits), Civil Procedure (4 credits), Legislation and Statutory Interpretation (2 credits), and Criminal Law (3 credits). In addition, every student is required to complete one semester of \"Economic Foundations of Legal Studies,\" a basic economics course taught by distinguished economists. First-year students may not take any electives.\n\nThe first-year students are graded according to a mandatory 3.25 curve.\n\nIn their second year of study, day students must complete a 4-credit Constitutional Law course and complete an additional 4 credits of LRWA. Students may select from a variety of upper-level electives in addition to these requirements.\n\nAccording to George Mason's official ABA-required disclosures, 56% of the Class of 2014 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation. Ten months after graduation, 84% of the Class of 2014 was employed in or about to begin full-time jobs requiring bar passage or jobs for which a J.D. provides an advantage. George Mason's Law School Transparency under-employment score is 16.8%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2014 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation.\n\nThe George Mason Law Library has a collection of electronic and print materials providing access to legal treatises, journals, and databases. Non-legal materials are available through the GMU University Libraries. It is a selective depository for U.S. Government documents, and it provides interlibrary lending services with other academic libraries, which enables students and faculty to borrow materials from major academic libraries. The library occupies four levels of the law school building. It has 14 study rooms, 70 carrel seats, and 196 table seats wired with electrical and network connections, and a wireless network is available. The library also operates 2 computer labs with a variety of software. The library employs 16 full-time staff members, including 6 librarians with degrees in law and library science and 3 technology specialists.\n\n\n\nProfessors from the Antonin Scalia Law School advocate with the federal government to expand copyright and reduce what the government asks from private corporations in return for public funding. In particular, they opposed a federal open-access mandate in 2020.\n\nOther Antonin Scalia Law School professors were criticised by lawmakers for their conflict of interest within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as they advocated for policies favorable to financial corporations which were also their paying clients.\n\nThe Antonin Scalia Law School partially overlapped at times with the George Mason Environmental Law Clinic or Free Market Environmental Law Clinic, which merged with the Energy & Environment Legal Institute (E&E Legal) (formerly the American Tradition Institute (ATI)), known for its climate science denialism and funded by the coal industry.\nAntonin Scalia Law School leadership in one occasion «admonished the professors for engaging in \"irresponsible advocacy\"» which had the goal to receive corporate donations in return for attacks on climate science.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is part of the \"WWE SmackDown vs. Raw\" (later renamed to simply \"WWE\") video game series based on the professional wrestling promotion World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It is the sequel to 2004's \"WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw\" and was succeeded by \"WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007\" in 2006.\n\nThe main focus of the game is to bring more realism and authenticity to the series with many new features, breaking away from the arcade-like gameplay that earlier games in the \"SmackDown!\" series possessed. As well as the addition of the new Buried Alive and Fulfill Your Fantasy matches, the game also included two new modes: General Manager and Create-An-Entrance.\n\nThis game is the first one in the \"SmackDown!\" series to be published for the PlayStation Portable. It is also the last game in the series to be released exclusively for the PlayStation 2. It is the best selling game for the PlayStation 2 console out of the series. A steelbook version of the game was released exclusively in Australia.\n\nA new momentum bar has been introduced to determine the flow of the match, replacing the old clean/dirty and \"SmackDown!\" meters. If the player chooses their wrestler to fight clean, he/she will be portrayed as a face, If they choose fight dirty, he/she will be portrayed as a heel. The player also has to deal with a stamina bar, which drains as the wrestlers fights; the more elaborate the move, the more the wrestler will be tired. However, this is an optional feature and can be removed in the options menu. The player has to regenerate their stamina bar to prevent becoming completely exhausted and unable to perform. Each character also has a new stamina attribute, making those with a low stamina rating tire more easily. Also included is a new Hardcore attribute, allowing those rated high to inflict more damage to their opponent with weapons.\n\nGrapples have been improved, with each character having more specialized grapple types than the previous game's unchangeable group of four grapples. Each character has choice of three out of seven grapples: Power, Speed, Technical, Brawler, Martial Arts, Luchadore, and Old School. Each character has as well a Clean/Dirty grapple and a Submission grapple, making the total of grapples five. A new power Irish whip has been included, giving more offense to the opponent but at the price of draining more stamina.\n\nThe game includes the SummerSlam, Backlash, ECW One Night Stand, Royal Rumble, No Mercy, No Way Out, Judgment Day, Unforgiven, New Year's Revolution, Vengeance, The Great American Bash, Taboo Tuesday, Survivor Series, and WrestleMania 21 PPV arenas, as well as the WrestleMania IX arena. There are also arenas based on each WWE television show (Raw, SmackDown!, Heat, and Velocity).\n\nThe arena crowd has also improved, with fully 3D characters replacing the mixture of 3D and 2D characters in the previous games.\n\nWWE Smackdown! vs. Raw 2006 features the video game debuts of 20 superstars, as well as the returns of Hulk Hogan (in both his 80's, nWo \"Hollywood\", and 2000's versions) and Stone Cold Steve Austin; both men had been left out from the previous game (and in Hogan's case, \"WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain\") due to their sabbaticals from the company.\n\n\"WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006\" includes an improved steel cage match, now allowing the player to escape through the cage's door. The Bra and Panties match has been replaced by a Fulfill Your Fantasy match, which is based on the costume-based diva match that occurred on the Taboo Tuesday pay-per-view event. Unlike the real event which is more battle royal–based, this version involves divas stripping their opponents to their bra and panties, spanking and throwing pillow shots instead. In addition, in Exhibition and in General Manager mode, the match can only take place in the SummerSlam arena.\n\nThe Buried Alive match, a feature requested by players for several years, finally makes its debut. The gameplay of the \"Buried Alive\" match is actually more reminiscent of a heavily improved casket match from \"\", in that the player had to trap their opponent in a casket to show a cut scene of the burial. Backstage fights are also improved and now include random people (referees, officials, and WWE personnel), who can be interacted with, backstage passing by during matches. In total, 100 different match types are available.\n\nThe series' trademark Season mode lasts for two in-game years, one for the \"RAW\" brand and one for the \"SmackDown!\" brand. The objective of the mode is to win both brands' two main championships, the WWE Championship (SmackDown!) and the World Heavyweight Championship (RAW). The mode features 100 different motion-captured cinematic cut scenes, real-time storytelling, and improved voice acting. Players have a choice of five original voices for created superstars. A new 3D customizable locker room is also included.\n\nIn contrast to the game's predecessor, some of the in-game legends also have voice-overs and are made playable in Season mode. In an interview, THQ designer Bryan Williams confirmed that only 32 superstars (which included Stone Cold Steve Austin, Mankind, and Hulk Hogan) could be used in season mode. Some of the standard characters in the game cannot be used in Season mode. These wrestlers include Steven Richards, Ric Flair, and Eugene.\n\nGeneral Manager mode, which could be compared to the \"Extreme Warfare\" games and \"Final Fire Pro Wrestling's\" Management of the Ring mode, is included for the first time. In this mode, the player takes the role of General Manager for either the \"SmackDown!\" or \"Raw\" brand. Players begin by picking one of the two brands, followed by a choice of simulating or participating in a draft, where a player can pick a total of 20 Superstars. The player then allocates the championships before beginning the season. This mode goes into depth, with e-mail capabilities, the ability to book matches and statistics of how the fans reacted to the show, among other features. When WrestleMania rolls around, the General Manager of the Year is awarded, along with some unlockable features.\n\nAs in the previous game, online play is available for those with a Sony Network Adapter. The title belts (including Create-A-Belt creations) can be defended online via a \"virtual WWE Championship\" with career leader boards and a permanent ID system that tracks all user stats. Players are also able to trade wrestlers created in the Create-A-Superstar mode with each other online. All arenas are also available for online play, including the unlockable WrestleMania IX Arena.\n\nThe game sports a variety of create modes. Create-A-Belt is a returning feature, with players now able to create Tag Team belts. Along with the created belts is the inclusion of title belts used in WWE during 2005, the WWE, World Heavyweight, Intercontinental, United States, WWE Tag Team, World Tag Team, Women's, and Cruiserweight championships. Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Championship and the WWE Hardcore Championship can also be won and defended in the game. The game also allows the player to defend and challenge for any of the titles in the game in Exhibition mode, a feature which was missing in previous games (after \"Smackdown 2: Know Your Role).\n\nThe Create-A-Superstar mode is much the same as the previous installments in this series. \"SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006\" adds a few new features, such as new items in the makeup category to give the player's created superstar more realistic facial features (such as wrinkles, a cleft chin, acne, and scars). Also included are new shirts and pants, which while unchangeable in color, look more realistic (as opposed to the \"painted on\" look of shirts from previous games).\n\nThe Create-A-Move-Set mode, much like Create-A-Superstar, remains the same, except for updated and new moves.\n\nThe Create-A-Stable mode has five pre-made stables such as the Basham Brothers and La Résistance. This mode gives players a chance to make wrestler 'groups' of 2-5 wrestlers, give a name for the stable, make an entrance (but not as advanced as the Create-An-Entrance mode) for the stable, and customize their teamwork attributes, deciding on how well they perform as a team in the ring.\n\nThe game also includes a new Create-An-Entrance mode, allowing the player to customize a wrestler's entrance, down to details such as pyrotechnics, arena lighting, and camera angles. The one-minute limit for all entrances that was enforced in previous games is now abolished. However, it received some criticism in comparison to sister game \"WWE Day of Reckoning 2\" which had more options, no loading times, and was easier to use.\n\nFor the first time in the \"SmackDown!\" series, a game is also available on the PlayStation Portable (PSP). Although it is very similar to the PS2 version, there are special features that are exclusive to this version that the PS2 version did not bear. Because of this, to unlock the full features of each game, USB connectivity between the PS2 and PSP is needed.\n\nJake \"The Snake\" Roberts is the exclusive PSP Legend and can only be played in the PS2 version by connecting the PSP to the PS2. However, before the PSP game was released, cheat devices also allowed Roberts to be unlocked. Other notable differences between the PS2 and PSP versions include the lack of in-ring commentary and the inclusion of voiceovers from the more popular wrestlers. The only major problem seen by most gamers was the game's horrendous loading times. They were so long that there was a warning about the load times when a created superstar is chosen for a match.\n\nThe PSP version includes some features that were not included in the PS2 version. These features include three exclusive minigames that are playable from the start. All of these minigames offer single player and multiplayer modes. In multiplayer mode, players can make use of PSP's Wi-Fi functionality. Each mode allows up to four players to join in and play over a local connection.\n\nThe first minigame, \"WWE Game Show\", tests the knowledge of wrestling fans by offering 500 multi-layered wrestling questions. The \"WWE Game Show\" covers every wrestling topic imaginable including costumes, trends, music, finishers, styles, history, feuds, and more. Most questions include excerpts of songs and have players guess the tune or players are shown a video clip and must guess the match the clip is from. The questions range from easy to extremely difficult. Other minigames include a poker game and Eugene's airplane game in which the player navigates Eugene around the ring in the fastest time.\n\nThe game received \"generally favorable\" reviews on both platforms, according to review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nThe game was praised by some critics for its depth of content. A GameSpot reviewer mentioned \"the sheer breadth of content makes it an easy choice for any wrestling enthusiast, and quite possibly the best wrestling game available for the system.\" Comparisons with the game and the highly acclaimed Nintendo 64 game \"WWF No Mercy\" were made, with some reviewers putting the game on par with \"No Mercy\". An IGN reviewer commented that \"there's no other wrestling game since \"No Mercy\" that offers this much replay, value, or depth\", while a Netjak reviewer quoted, \"\"WWF No Mercy\" on the Nintendo 64 ruled as the best wrestling game, but \"WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006\" is the new standard.\" In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave the PlayStation 2 version a score of three eights and one seven for a total of 31 out of 40.\n\nHowever, there were some complaints for the game's limitations of game modes. Critics such as \"X-Play\"'s reviewer felt that the General Manager mode \"does not go as far as it should--no underhanded options--but it's a great start,\" while an eToychest reviewer quoted about the Season mode \"for the first time through this more visual style of story has a lot going for it, but gameplay is about replayability, which is something that is sorely lacking here due to the limit placed on possible story arcs.\"\n\nFrom the game's release up until December 2006, the game sold 3.3 million copies. The PlayStation 2 version received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom. On 23 October 2006, the game was added to Sony's Greatest Hits collection.\n\n"}

It was named after Basarabi, a village in Dolj County, south-western Romania, nowadays an administrative component of the Calafat municipality. It is sometimes grouped with related Bosut culture, into the Bosut-Basarabi complex.\n\nThe Basarabi culture is related to the Hallstatt culture of the Iron Age period that, when normalised, is uniformly spread apart from a reduced number of sites in Muntenia, the central Moldavian Carpathians and Oltenia. \n\nThe Hallstatt A (12-11th BC) and B (10-8th BC) corresponds to the late Bronze Age, Hallstatt C (7th BC) to the early Iron Age, and Hallstatt D (6th BC) to the Iron Age. The Hallstatt culture probably consisted of many different peoples and language groups. The variant known as the Basarabi culture was present over much of Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia (Vojvodina), and central Moldavia up to the Dniester River (Nistru in Romanian) around 650 BC. \n\nDuring this period the Greeks founded cities along the Black Sea coast and the first written records describe their encounters with the indigenous people.\n"}

Founded in 1999, it was the first new CPS high school to be built in 20 years. It is a selective enrollment school, and teaches only at the Honors and AP levels (excluding the P.E. department). Northside has earned a reputation for academic excellence, and has been consistently ranked as the #1 high school in Illinois by \"US News and World Report\".\n\nIn 2014, it was ranked #3 in the nation by \"Newsweek\". The school's establishment, part of former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley's plan to reinvent the city's public school system, generated controversy in the city and in the education community. The facilities were built with a $52.5 million budget that critics said could have better served other schools in city.\n\nFounded in 1999, it was the first new Chicago Public School (CPS) high school to be built in 20 years.

Daley's plan to reinvent the city's public school system, generated controversy in the city and in the education community. The facilities were built with a $52.5 million budget that critics said could have better served other schools in city.\n\nAdmission to Northside Prep follows the selective enrollment application system. Factors considered in the application include a student's grades from 7th grade, standardized test scores, entrance exam scores, and socio-economic status. As of 2016-2017, the demographic makeup of Northside Prep HS was 30.0% white, 19.0% Asian, 29.0% Hispanic, 8.0% black, and 0.4% Native American. As of 2012-2013, 35.5% of the school's students were low-income, 6% were special education students, and 0.7% were limited English learners.\n\nNorthside College Prep is well known for the success of its students in the college admissions process, with over a quarter of the senior class gaining admission to the nation's top universities. Over 99% of the graduating senior class matriculates to college. In addition, the student body as a whole earns a large amount of financial aid from various sources.\n\n\nWith the exception of physical education classes, all courses in Northside are either Honors or (AP) (Advanced Placement). Northside has 24 advanced placement classes. Northside's math program is unique from most other high schools in that it uses the Interactive Mathematics Program, also known as IMP, instead of a traditional math track. IMP is very writing based, with students writing portfolios and projects instead of simply solving mathematical equations. Aside from four IMP courses, Northside also offers College Math, AP Statistics, AP Calculus BC, AP Calculus AB, and Multi-Variable Calculus.\n\nNorthside also offers special education services for incoming students with diagnosed disabilities. The school's Office of Specialized Services helps to arrange appropriate accommodations. Given its extremely competitive academic environment, Northside successfully lobbied the Chicago Board of Education to eliminate class rankings. This effort was led by former principal Dr. James Lalley.\n\nNorthside's classes run on a block schedule. Classes meet twice a week: on Mondays and Thursdays or Tuesdays and Fridays. The school day used to start at 8:16 a.m. and ended at 3:30 p.m. until the 2014–15 school year when the school day at Northside now starts at 8:00 a.m. and now ends at 3:04 p.m. (except for Colloquium schedule where it ends at 3:01 p.m.). Each block is 100 minutes long with an 8 minute passing period between blocks. Wednesdays are reserved for an approximately three-hour non-credit class on five-day weeks called Colloquium. Dozens of colloquia are offered, with a wide range of interest such as motorcycle repair, computers, robotics, consumer-education, sewing, quilting, art, photography, paper craft, and Asian calligraphy, and each relates to one specific theme that changes every year. Classes are chosen by students twice a year (every semester, or otherwise it is year-long); availability is dependent on popularity and student's year ranking: seniors get first pick, then juniors, sophomores, and lastly freshmen; all of this is done online, through sound programming, with student portals opening at 7 am for students to start registering. There are different dates for different year students. These are the only classes in which students either pass or fail. Colloquium clubs vary from year to year.\n\nAfter colloquium on Wednesdays, Northside College Prep has X and Y block classes. X and Y block classes are classes that students re-pick every week that will help them most that specific week. For instance if a student needs help in math homework they can choose a math tutoring class for either their X or Y block that week (each block used to be about 50 minutes long until the 2014–15 school year where now X and Y are 60 minutes long). Northside recently implemented and utilizes online student programming, in which students access and select their schedules through internet programming for both classes and colloquium. Courses for the upcoming school year are programmed at the end of the first semester of the current school year.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, Northside installed a 105-panel solar thermal system on the southern half of its roof. These solar panels work to heat the school's pool and have the capacity to provide hot water to the entire school. This project was head by Northside science teacher Mr. Mike Coy, and Alexandra Rojek, Northside's 2011 valedictorian.\n\nLocated behind the school is the Joy Garden, a continuation of Northside's efforts to become a more sustainable institution. The Joy Garden is a 10,000 square foot situated adjacent to the eastern front of the building and was built entirely through the efforts of students with the help of Urban Habitat Chicago. The garden is equipped with the latest in green technology, including a self-sustainable storm water management system and permeable concrete. However, it is more than just ecologically functional and friendly. This garden was built with a particular emphasis on providing a stimulating environment for special needs students. It extends from a traditional garden environment to one that is accessible to all students.\n\nNorthside competes in the Chicago Public League (CPL) and is a member of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA). The Boy's Varsity Cross Country Team won the IHSA Regional title in 2008 and was the City Champion in 2009. The Boy's Varsity Track and Field Team won the IHSA Sectional Title in 2013 and 2016. The Girl's Varsity Cross Country Team won the IHSA Regional title in 2011, 2015, and 2016. The Girls Varsity Cross Country Team won the IHSA Sectional Title in 2016. The Girl's Varsity Cross Country Team was the City Champion in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. The Girl's Varsity Track and Field Team won the IHSA Sectional Title in 2012. In 2016, under Coach Jon Gordon, the Northside College Prep Varsity Women Cross Country Team became the only CPS School to ever finish in the Top 6 in the State Cross Country Championships. The girl's varsity softball team were regional champions in 2011–12, 2012–13; and became the city champion. In 2013, The girls' varsity volleyball finished first in their conference (Red North). Pom-Pons team placed 1st in the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) city championship and placed 2nd in the IDTA state competition in 2013. Girls Swimming CPS city champions tie with Lane Tech in 2012 and champions in 2014. Boys Swimming CPS champions 2016 and 2017. In 2018, Northside formed its first Women's Badminton team, winning 1st place in Doubles, and finishing 2nd overall as a team in the very first CPS City Championship. \nSports Offerings:\n\n\n"}

Both have now been reclassified as \"Homo erectus\", and the genus \"Sinanthropus\" is disused. Beginning in the year 1928 to the year 1937, there were 14 fragmented skulls belonging to the hominids found in various locations in China. Peking and Chou K’ou-tien are two notable places with fossils found. It has been noted by researchers that it is likely that the fragmented skulls found were brought to the cave after being severed from the bodies they belonged to. This is very probable because of among the pieces found, most are teeth and jaw. Some skulls are missing large parts which indicates separation before they were fossilized, not the loss of pieces due to fossilization process. \n\n\"Sinanthropus\" contained four species:\n\nAt the time, the Sinanthropus were distinguished by the massiveness of the bone fragments that were found. The average cranial capacity found was measured at around 1075 c.c. More specificities described by researchers indicated that Sinanthropus has a different jaw than found in gorillas, similar cranial size to Pithecanthropus, and smaller molars than those found in Pithecanthropus. Researchers were also able to conclude that the teeth found were larger in comparison to Neanderthal men found at the time and the upper canine was long, wide, and similar to that of a tusk. The difference in teeth size created variability among the genus.\n\nIn the 1930s, papers were published regarding the Sinanthropus and they sought to examine the new hominids and their similar features to other discovered hominids. Dr. Weidenreich was a well-known contributor who was also received blame for a controversy surrounding Sinanthropus. He wrote a research paper about the similarities found in Sinanthropus and Pithecanthropus, where he mentioned the cranial size, jaw proportions and teeth size. Another researcher took an opposing stand and stated that Sinanthropus was “clearly Neanderthaloid”. These two conversations may be responsible for sparking the question revolving if the Sinanthropus was even to be considered a genus.\n"}

He was a member of the Democratic Party.\n\nBlackwell was born in Whitsett, Fayette County, Pennsylvania on August 1, 1931. After attending West Philadelphia High School, he took a job as a dockworker and briefly pursued a career as a boxer. In 1953, he was drafted into the United States Army and served in the Korean War. Blackwell was a boxing champion during his years in the Army. After his service ended, he returned to the docks as a longshoreman. In 1973, he became the president of the International Longshoremen's Association, Local 1332.\n\nBlackwell's professional political career began with election to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives where he served from 1973 to 1975.\n\n\"Lucien the Solution\" was best known as a vibrant member of the Philadelphia City Council from 1975 to 1991. While serving on the Council, Blackwell served several terms as Chairman of the Finance Committee, where he led the charge to divest pension funds from businesses doing business in South Africa. Blackwell also sponsored the Philadelphia's first law to create opportunities for minorities and women to compete to obtain city contracts. Blackwell was also heavily involved in legislation to create the Pennsylvania Convention Center and in passing the law that broke Philadelphia's long-standing building height limit, allowing for the construction of Philadelphia's One Liberty Place. Blackwell was perhaps best known for his fiery oratory on the Council floor and for serving as a mentor to the former Philadelphia Mayor (and Council President) John Street.

His mother, Anglique Marie d'Arlus, comtesse de Montrond (died 1827), was a royalist writer, said to be the author of the \"Troubadour barnois\", a song which has the refrain \"Louis, le fils de Henri, Est prisonnier dans Paris\". Casimir was imprisoned in 1794 in St. Lazare, where he met a woman. He bought her freedom and his own with 100 louis. They married and crossed to London, but the union proved unhappy, and they were divorced on their return to Paris.\n\nTurning to the fashionable world, Casimir de Montrond became famous for his successes. He was the confidant and political agent of Talleyrand, and his inside knowledge of politics enabled him to make a large fortune on the Bourse. In 1809 he was disgraced for some imprudent comments on the imperial system, and exiled from Paris. After spending some time at Antwerp he removed to Spa, where he was on intimate terms with Pauline Borghese, and in 1811 he returned to Antwerp; here he was arrested on Napoleon's orders and sent to the fortress of Ham. After a month's imprisonment, he received permission to reside, under police supervision, at Chátillon-sur-Seine, whence he presently escaped to England.\n\nHe returned to France at the first Bourbon restoration, and during the Hundred Days was entrusted with a mission to Vienna to convert Talleyrand to Napoleon's interests, to see Metternich and Nesselrode, and to bring back, if possible, Marie Louise and the King of Rome. The second restoration restored him to his social triumphs, though he was always under police supervision, and on Talleyrand's fall he accompanied him to Château de Valençay and continued to help with his intrigues. He followed Talleyrand to London in 1832. Montrond returned to Paris some time before his death in 1843.\n\nAccording to \"Recollections and Anecdotes\" of Captain Rees Howell Gronow, Montrond originated the sayings falsely attributed to Talleyrand:\n\n“La parole a été donnée à l’homme pour l’aider à cacher sa pensée.” \n[“Speech was given to man to aid him at concealing his thoughts.”]\n\n“Défiez-vous des premiers mouvements ; ils sont presque toujours bons.” \n[“Mistrust first impulses; they are nearly always good.”]\n"}

He was a pundit for BBC Sport football shows including \"Football Focus\" and \"The Football League Show\", until 2015 when he became both manager and a director at newly formed Salisbury.\n\nClaridge's career was known for its longevity and diversity. Born in Portsmouth, he has spent a number of periods with teams from Hampshire and Dorset, having begun his career with non-league Fareham Town in 1983. After failing to gain a permanent contract at local league club A.F.C. Bournemouth, Claridge spent three years at Weymouth, in his longest single spell with any club. From 1988 till 1996 Claridge played for a number of Football League teams, before moving to Leicester City with whom he played in the Premier League and won the 1997 Football League Cup. In 1998, he moved to Portsmouth, where he was also player manager from 2000 to 2001. After a spell with Millwall, he dropped down to the Southern Premier League to work as player-manager for Weymouth. After this ended in 2004, Claridge played for ten different clubs in a variety of leagues, never spending more than a season with one team. He has played at all levels of English football and has also appeared in 1000 professional or semi-professional football matches.\n\nAfter formally retiring from football in 2007, Claridge moved into media work for the BBC. His experience of the Football League has been used to position him as an expert at that level, though he works across a variety of different football programmes on the BBC. After retirement he occasionally played semi-professional football for clubs in south England, most recently in 2017 for Salisbury.\n\nClaridge was born in Portsmouth and grew up in Titchfield, a village near Fareham, and attended Brookfield Community School in Sarisbury Green. He was an adopted child.\n\nClaridge initially played for Fareham Town in the Southern League. He got into Football League side Bournemouth, though Claridge again stepped down the leagues after just seven games for Bournemouth to sign for Weymouth. \n\nIn October 1988 Claridge moved to Crystal Palace for a brief period before opting to join Division Four team Aldershot for season 88–89. He spent two years with the club before signing with Cambridge United for £75,000. He moved with Cambridge up into the Second Division (which later became the First Division) and stayed with the club for most of the next four years. His tempestuous relationship with manager John Beck, which was exacerbated by Claridge's gambling problems, eventually led to his being sold to Luton Town for only £120,000 in March 1992. With Luton in financial difficulties however he was sold back to Cambridge, for £190,000, just five months later (Beck having left the club by this time).\n\nIn January 1994 Claridge moved to Birmingham City for £350,000. In 1994–95, he became the first player since Trevor Francis to score 20 goals in a season for Birmingham, a performance that earned him the club's Player of the Year award. Claridge was transferred to Leicester City for £1.2 million in March 1996. It was at Leicester that Claridge reached the Premiership, scoring winning goals in both the 1996 play-off final that gave Leicester promotion and the 1997 League Cup final replay. In 1997 his autobiography \"Tales From The Boot Camps\", co-written with Ian Ridley, was first published.\n\nIn 1998 Claridge joined hometown club Portsmouth on loan and, following a brief period at Wolverhampton Wanderers, signed for Portsmouth on a permanent basis. From 2000 this was as a player-manager, though Claridge's reign lasted for just twenty-five games before he was demoted. After a period on loan with Millwall, he moved to the London club on a free transfer in 2001. He spent two seasons with Millwall before returning to Weymouth as the club's new player-manager. Weymouth just missed out on promotion to the Football Conference. Following Ian Ridley's resignation as chairman, Claridge also left to return to playing league football.\n\nIn his later playing career, chronologically, Claridge played for Brighton and Hove Albion, Brentford, Wycombe Wanderers, Gillingham, Bradford City and Walsall. In the summer of 2005 he was appointed as manager of Millwall, but following board-room changes he was relieved of his duties after just 36 days, before his team had played any competitive matches. His replacement was Colin Lee. The decision to dismiss Claridge was taken by new chairman Theo Paphitis, who stated to the BBC that \"we had a strong chance of being relegated under Steve\". Millwall were indeed relegated from the Championship that season.\n\nAt the start of the 2006–07 season Claridge didn't have a club. It was reported that Claridge had offered to play without payment in order to achieve the landmark of 1,000 games. Eventually in December 2006 he re-signed on a month-long contract with Bournemouth and his 1,000th first-team match was a 4–0 defeat to Port Vale on 9 December, at age 40.\n\nOn 16 January 2007 he signed a contract with Isthmian League Premier Division side Worthing to play in one game only, against AFC Wimbledon. The match ended in a 1–1 draw.\n\nOn 30 January 2007 Claridge joined Harrow Borough and scored on his debut in a 4–4 draw against Margate.\n\nIn September 2009, Claridge came out of retirement to play unpaid for his former club, the Conference South side Weymouth, who were in severe financial difficulties.\n\nClaridge then came out of retirement once more in October 2011 when he signed for Gosport Borough of the Southern League Division One South & West as a player-coach. On 22 October 2011, Claridge scored on his début for Gosport during their FA Trophy game against Southern League side Sholing; his first league goal came a week later on 29 October 2011 in a 2–1 defeat of Mangotsfield United at Privett Park \n\nOn 7 May 2012, Gosport were promoted to the Southern League Premier Division courtesy of Claridge's brace of goals in the play-off final against Poole Town. Having been losing 1–0, Claridge scored a last-gasp equaliser in the first minute of injury time to send the tie to extra-time; Claridge scored Gosport's third goal in the 98th minute as they ran out eventual 3–1 winners, and returned to the Premier Division after a 22-year absence.\n\nShortly after the playoff final, Claridge said he was contemplating retirement, however he later admitted he was considering playing for a further season following Gosport's promotion.\n\nOn 1 July 2017, the 51-year-old Claridge played for Salisbury in a friendly against Portsmouth due to a lack of players. Salisbury lost the match 3–0. On 15 August, he played in a Southern League Division One South & West match against Paulton Rovers, playing himself as a 78th-minute substitute in a 2–2 draw; he also started Salisbury's next match, a 3–2 FA Cup victory over Fareham Town, substituting himself off after 71 minutes after sustaining an injury. In an interview with BBC Sport in 2018, Claridge revealed that he had retired from playing as a result of this injury.\n\nDuring Claridge's time at Weymouth, he and Ian Ridley, who was club chairman at the time, were two of the subjects of a BBC documentary called \"Football Stories\"; he left Weymouth to begin to work in the media, initially for BBC Radio 5 Live. He works for the BBC mainly on \"The Football League Show\", and stated his opposition to the use of goal-line technology. He also has contributed scouting reports to \"The Guardian\".\n\nIn June 2008, Claridge was convicted of dangerous driving and sentenced to six months' imprisonment, suspended for two years, after speeding at in \"treacherous\" conditions. He already had nine points on his driving licence.\n\nBirmingham City\n\nLeicester City\n\n"}
