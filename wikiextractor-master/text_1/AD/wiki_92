It was the first time for an Asian country to host the event. Pope John Paul II presided over the event, marking his second trip to the country as Pope after his visit in 1981, and also the last papal visit in the country of the 20th century and 2nd millennium.\n\nSince the opening ceremony, the Pope underlines the importance of the Filipino Catholic Church. At the meeting of the Federation of Asian Bishops' Conferences (FABC), the Pope points out what are the new areas of the contemporary mission: the poor of cities, migrants, refugees, young people, the media and social communications. \"In the first millennium,\" he says, \"the Cross has been planted on the soil of Europe; in the second on that of America and Africa; we can pray that in the third Christian millennium in this vast and vital continent there will be a great harvest of faith to be harvested\".\n\nA week before the celebration of the World Youth Day proper, two representatives from each of countries all over the world gathered for an International Youth Forum (IYF) at the University of Santo Tomas. The Philippines sent eight representatives, while others were from the different Catholic religious youth organizations and campuses. These were the selected youth leaders and coordinators. During their five-day stay in UST, representatives were grouped and discussed issues and concerns laid out by the Episcopal Commission on Youth, on topics set months before.\n\nThe IYF was also a venue wherein few from these selected youth representative had able to have a short talk with the Pope.\nYoung pilgrims gathered from many different parts of the world to celebrate God together, to learn other cultures and to speak as \"brothers and sisters\" among themselves. There was also a Mass where some youths directly received Communion from the Pope. Youth pilgrims gathered from different parts of the world to worship and talk together. Different activities were held, including a traditional \"Barrio Fiesta\", where it was possible to search company and entertainment. During these days, Masses were celebrated every day in most parishes throughout the Philippines.\n\nThe closing Mass, held at Luneta Park, was estimated to have been attended by more than 5 million people, the second-largest papal gathering in history.\n\nThe event saw the presence of Catholic representatives of all Chinese communities: China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, and Singapore. Already on 12 January, the archbishop of Taipei, Joseph Ti-kang, celebrated mass with 5 priests of the \"official\" Chinese Roman Catholic Church. On 14 January, through Radio Veritas, the pope launches a message of reconciliation between the \"official\" and underground Chinese Church addressed to \"all the Catholic faithful\". At the end of the Mass in Luneta Park, the Pope greeted in Chinese, the language of China and Taiwan.\n\nThis was Pope John Paul II's last visit to the Philippines, as his scheduled return for the World Meeting of Families in January 2003 fell through due to the progression of Parkinson's disease.\n\nThe official song for World Youth Day 1995 was released in 1994, titled \"Tell the World of His Love\", composed by Trina Belamide.\n\n\"As the Father has sent me, so am I sending you\". (Jn 20:21) the same as that of the World Youth Day of 1994, which was celebrated at the diocesan level on Palm Sunday of that year, fall on March 22.\n\nRamzi Yousef, an Al-Qaeda member, attempted to assassinate the Pope in the Bojinka Plot, but the plan was discovered four days earlier and Yousef fled to Pakistan.\n\n"}

His artwork was shown in museums and at major galleries of Europe at his artistic height (in the 1930s). He was awarded various medals for his works, including a gold medal from the Russian tsar for his \"Battle of Borodin\".\n\nMatzek fought in the Austrian-Hungarian cavalry in World War I, and was imprisoned in Siberia after the October Revolution. He was able to escape, and in the following years he managed to walk back to Europe, although details of this trek are largely unknown. On a winter day after World War II, he was found sick and half-frozen by villagers of Balatun in Bosnia. He remained in the town, supported by the townspeople in exchange for painting frescos in their churches. Matzek was placed in the most honorable home in the community, of a young widow with three children, the mother of the sculptor Slobodan Pejić. For almost ten years, Matzek educated the boy (he was the only father the boy ever knew; they became inseparable and painted frescos together, the boy painting the lower parts and Matzek painting the upper areas), and eventually married the mother.\n\nIn Harkanovci there is the parish church of Our Lady, built in 1799, restored and expanded in 1938. The entire interior was painted with frescoes and stained glass was created for the windows. The frescoes were painted by Karl Matzek in the period from 1955 to 1957. His frescos decorate also churches/monasteries in Janja, in Dragaljevac, in Bijeljina and elsewhere. Earlier Matzek had been sentenced to death by communist authorities, but in Bosnia he was saved by the influence of the parish priest don Mirko Gazivode. In return he painted two murals in the church. Parishioners liked them and then ordered all other frescoes in the church.\n\nMatzek migrated to Perth, Western Australia, in 1958. There he painted the Stations of the Cross, a series of 14 pictures, in the \"Como Catholic Church\" and in 1961 a series of murals for the Church of Sts. Peter and Paul at the Redemptorist Monastery, North Perth. \nMatzek later moved to Canberra, where a sizeable Serbian immigrant population had accumulated beginning in 1949. The Serbs built St George Serbian Orthodox Church in 1966, after the Government granted them a block of land at the National Circuit, Forrest, close to Parliament House. In the following year, Matzek, then 77, was commissioned to decorate the interior of the church, and for the next 16 years, until his death in 1983, he devoted himself to painting the side walls, ceiling and altar screen, depicting episodes in Serbian history as well as Biblical scenes. Even though the Church itself is small in size, Matzek’s two 20-metre-long panoramas and murals have attracted visitors daily from all parts of Australia and overseas. \nTimes had been rough for many years after his arrival to Australia, but Matzek had hoped that his family could join him there eventually. Since he had moved to Australia and until his death, due to difficulties and expenses involved in global communication in those times, Matzek remained only in written contact with the family in Bosnia, hoping for a long time that they could join him. He sent art books and art journals to Pejić, and supported his family financially as much as possible.\n\nLater in his life, during his continued work with the Church, Matzek converted to the Orthodox faith as \"George\". Following a brief illness, Matzek died on 16 April 1983, and was buried at the St. Sava Monastery Cemetery in Canberra.\n\n"}

He was awarded a bachelor's and a medical degree by Johns Hopkins University in 1905, and took postgraduate courses in Berlin, Munich and Vienna. He returned to America in 1909 to join the teaching staff at Johns Hopkins. He rose to the position of assistant professor, lecturing in pharmacology from 1912 to 1932. His grandson, Kenneth Lasson, would later report that at that time Johns Hopkins had a faculty quota limiting the number of Jewish staff that could proceed to full faculty.\n\nIn 1928 Macht received the first degree of advanced research awarded at Yeshiva College, New York, being made Doctor of Hebrew Literature. From 1933 to 1941 he served as visiting professor of general physiology at Yeshiva College.\n\nFrom 1944 Macht was a consultant in pharmacology at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore until he suffered a stroke in 1957. He died four years later at the same hospital. Currently, Johns Hopkins honors Dr. Macht via the David I. Macht award.\n\nMacht published over 900 scientific studies, and three books. He introduced a number of new methods of treatment of diseases. His contributions include:\n\nThe term \"psychopharmacology\" (the branch of science concerned with the way drugs affect the mind and behaviour) was coined by Macht in 1920.\n\nMacht was known for his pioneering use of a technique he termed \"phytopharmacology\" which involved measuring the effects of drugs on plants. Macht's specific technique was to measure the growth rate of \"Lupinus albus\" seedlings when dosed with a test substance, and compare this against a control group of undosed seeds. The relative length of root growth would determine what he called the \"phytotoxic index\", and provide a measure of the toxicity of the substance to the plants.\n\nMacht applied his technique of phytopharmacology to a variety of substances, including the blood of people suffering from medical conditions. In 1930, he reported it could be used to demonstrate the presence of snake venom and menotoxin (a toxin thought to be present in the blood of menstruating women). He felt the technique could aid in the differential diagnosis of pernicious anemia, leprosy, pemphigus and other conditions. At the time of his death it was reported that his technique could serve as an indicator of mental illness, since \"\"the blood of persons suffering from certain types of mental illness acts as a poison on species of the European bean\"\". \n\nThe use of phytopharmacology as a predictor of toxicity to humans was mainly restricted to the work of Macht and Macht's work was published in the journal \"Science\". Currently, toxicity testing is mostly performed on animal subjects (both live animals and animal tissues), and the detection of individual toxins is performed with mass spectrometry.\n\nWhile Macht used the term phytopharmacology to refer to the effects of drugs on plants, the term is now only used to refer to the pharmacological usages of plants as medicine.\n\nMacht was an Orthodox Jew and a Doctor of Hebrew Literature, and he frequently advocated the position that there was a harmonious relationship between religion and science. He studied medical and other descriptions in the Bible and the Talmud, and published many papers that claimed to show that these were accurate descriptions of diseases or treatments. Such papers include:\n\n\n"}

In this television show, part of the Star Trek franchise, a Federation ship is stranded on the opposite side of the Galaxy as Earth in the late 2300s. On its way home the starship encounters many species of aliens and outer space phenomenon. In this episode their ship is split into two versions of itself sharing the same power source, while being attacked by a species of organ harvesting aliens known as the Vidiian.\n\n\"Voyager\" diverts through a dense nebula to prevent detection from two nearby Vidiian planets. As they exit it, the ship hits subspace-turbulence and suffers from power-failures. B'Elanna Torres prepares to begin a series of photon-bursts to keep the antimatter-reaction in the warp-engines alive; however, Voyager is bombarded with proton bursts from an unknown source. The bursts cause systems to fail across the ship, hull ruptures, and casualties, including the loss of Harry Kim through a hull breach and the newborn Naomi Wildman due to failures in her life-support system. Kes, en route to provide medical attention for the wounded, disappears through a space-time rift. As the crew recovers, Torres discovers there is air on the other side of the rift, and believes that it may be possible to rescue Kes. The bridge crew is forced to evacuate the bridge as it is engulfed in flames, but as she leaves, Captain Kathryn Janeway sees a ghostly image of the bridge-crew, calmly at their stations.\n\nThe viewer is then shown the immaculate bridge of \"Voyager\", where that version of Janeway watches a ghostly image of herself evacuate the bridge. This \"Voyager\" has not suffered from any ill effects, but is aware of a duplicate \"Voyager\" due to Kes's arrival through the rift. The respective crews are able to make contact with each other, and conclude that upon exiting the nebula, \"Voyager\" and its crew were duplicated as a result of a space-time rift, creating \"quantum doubles\". However, this did not replicate the anti-matter, and both ships are suffering from power-losses.\n\nThe two crews first attempt to merge the ships, but the effort is unsuccessful. Janeway from the undamaged \"Voyager\" crosses through the rift along with the duplicate of Kes. The two Janeways meet to discuss options, recognizing they would not be able to have the entire crew of the damaged \"Voyager\" evacuate to the undamaged one without creating a quantum imbalance. Janeway from the damaged \"Voyager\" states she will initiate a self-destruct of her ship to allow the undamaged one to regain power. Janeway from the undamaged ship asks her counterpart to delay the start of the self-destruct by 15 minutes to devise another option, and returns to her ship via the rift.\n\nThe undamaged \"Voyager\" is attacked by Vidiian ships; due to the lack of power, the ship is vulnerable and soon Vidiians appear on board the undamaged \"Voyager\" and begin harvesting vital organs from the crew. The damaged \"Voyager\" appears to be undetected by the Vidiians. Due to this fact, Janeway from the undamaged ship orders her Kim to collect baby Naomi Wildman and escape into the rift to the damaged \"Voyager\", and then begins a self-destruct of her \"Voyager\"; the explosion destroys the ship and the attacking Vidiians, leaving the damaged \"Voyager\" free and returning to normal power-reserves. Kim returns Naomi to her mother, and ponders whether this is really his \"Voyager\".\n\nWriter Brannon Braga was initially inspired to create an episode with a strange narrative structure, and the team felt like they needed a more action heavy episode. A similar episode was proposed, unsuccessfully, for and executive producer Jeri Taylor noted that difficulties that the writers encountered on that episode informed the structure of \"Deadlock\".\nThey decided to focus the story on the two Captain Janeways and their interactions, resulting in what actress Kate Mulgrew described as \"the most arduous and possibly the most satisfying work I've ever done, technically\".\n\nThe episode initially ran short, leaving the crew to shoot for extra days and write in extra material.\n\n\"Deadlock\" had a rating of 9/10 on TV.com, the highest of the season 2 of Voyager. It had Nielsen ratings of 5.8 points when it debuted in 1996 on UPN television. It was later voted the favourite episode of the second season during a fan poll.\nSimilarly Star Trek Monthly ranked the episode with 4/5 stars, and Cinefantastique 3/4.\n\nIn 2015, a \"Star Trek: Voyager\" binge-watching guide by W.I.R.E.D. suggested this episode should not be skipped.\n\n\"Den of Geek\" considers it one of the most brutal Voyager episodes and included it in their Voyager viewing guide in 2017. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" listed it in their top 15 episodes of \"Star Trek: Voyager\".

{"id": "2307416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2307416", "title": "Basoche", "text": "Basoche\n\nThe Basoche was the guild of legal clerks of the Paris court system under the pre-revolutionary French monarchy, from among whom legal representatives (\"procureurs\") were recruited. It was an ancient institution whose roots are unclear. The word itself derives from the Latin \"basilica\", the kind of building in which the legal trade was practiced in the Middle Ages.\n\nIt dated from the time when the profession of \"procureur\" (procurator, advocate or legal representative) was still free in the sense that persons rendering that service to others when so permitted by the law were not yet public and ministerial officers. For this purpose there was established near each important juridical centre a group of clerks, that is to say, of men skilled in law (or reputed to be so), who at first would probably fill indifferently the rôles of representative or advocate. Such was the origin of the Basoche of the parlement of Paris; which naturally formed itself into a guild, like other professions and trades in the Middle Ages.\n\nBut this organization eventually became disintegrated, dividing up into more specialized bodies: that of the advocates, whose history then begins; and that of legal representatives, whose profession was regularized in 1344, and speedily became a saleable charge. The remnant of the original clerks constituted the new Basoche, which thenceforward consisted only of those who worked as clerks for the procureurs, the richer ones among them aspiring themselves to attain the position of procureur. They all, however, retained some traces of their original conditions. \"They are admitted,\" writes an 18th-century author, \"to plead before M. le lieutenant civil \"sur les réferés\" and before M. le juge auditeur; so that the procureurs of these days are but the former clerks of the Basoche, admitted to officiate in important cases in preference to other clerks and to their exclusion.\"\n\nFrom its ancient past the Basoche had also preserved certain picturesque forms and names. It was called the \"kingdom of the \"Basoche\",\" and for a long time its chief, elected each year in general assembly, bore the title of \"king.\" This he had to give up towards the end of the 16th century, by order, it is said, of Henry III, and was thenceforth called the \"chancellor.\" At this time it is said that the order included 6,000 clerks. The Basoche had besides its \"maîtres des requêtes\", a grand court-crier, a referendary, an advocate-general, a \"procureur-général\", a chaplain, etc. In early days, and until the first half of the 16th century, it was organized in companies in a military manner and held periodical reviews or parades (\"montres\"), sometimes taking up arms in the king's service in time of war. Of this there survived later only an annual \"cavalcade\", when the members of the Basoche went to the royal forest of Bondy to cut the maypole, which they afterwards set up in the courtyard of the Palais de Justice, to the sound of tambourines and trumpets. We hear also of satirical and literary entertainments given by clerks of the Palais de Justice, and of the moralities played by them in public, which form an important element in the history of the national theatre; but at the end of the 16th century these performances were restricted to the great hall of the Palais.\n\nTo the last the Basoche retained two principal prerogatives. (1) In order to be recognized as a qualified procureur it was necessary to have gone through one's \"stage\" in the Basoche, to have been entered by name for ten years on its register. It was not sufficient to have been merely clerk to a procureur during the period and to have been registered at his office. This rule was the occasion of frequent conflicts during the 17th and 18th centuries between the members of the Basoche and the procureurs, and on the whole, despite certain decisions favouring the latter, the parlement maintained the rights of the Basoche. Opinion was favourable to it because the \"certificats de complaisance\" issued by the procureurs were dreaded. These certificats held good, moreover, in places where there was no Basoche. (2) The Basoche had judiciary powers recognized by the law. It had disciplinary jurisdiction over its members and decided personal actions in civil law brought by one clerk against another or by an outsider against a clerk. The judgment, at any rate if delivered by a \"maître des requêtes\", was authoritative, and could only be contested by a civil petition before the ancient council of the Basoche.\n\nThe Châtelet of Paris had its special basoche, which claimed to be older even than that of the Palais de Justice, and there was contention between them as to certain rights. The clerks of the procureurs at the \"cour des comptes\" of Paris had their own Basoche of great antiquity, called the \"empire de Galilée.\" The Basoche of the Palais de Justice had in its ancient days the right to create provostships in localities within the jurisdiction of the parlement of Paris, and thus there sprang up a certain number of local basoches. Others were independent in origin; among such being the \"regency\" of Rouen and the Basoche of the Parlement of Toulouse.\n\nIts powers faded over the years and towards the end, it had little genuine authority. It was abolished in the French revolution by the general decree of February 13, 1791. In modern French, \"basoche\" is a pejorative term for the legal trade as a whole.\n\n"}
{"id": "2307421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2307421", "title": "History of Illinois", "text": "History of Illinois\n\nThe history of Illinois may be defined by several broad historical periods, namely, the pre-Columbian period, the era of European exploration and colonization, its development as part of the American frontier, and finally, its growth into one of the most populous and economically powerful states of the United States.\n\nCahokia, the urban center of the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture, was located near present-day Collinsville, Illinois. Several burial mounds and adobe structures were created in Southern Illinois across the Mississippi River from St. Louis. A gigantic mound, known as Monk's Mound near Cahokia, is about the same height from its base as the Pyramid of Giza. Built around 1050 AD by an immense marshaling of human labor, this huge earth-work faced the site of a palisaded city that contained more than one hundred small artificial mounds marking burial sites. This Mississippi valley city of Cahokia is estimated to have had a population of about 16000 to 20000, the most concentrated population north of the Rio Grande until the late 1700s. Radiating out from Cahokia for many miles were tilled fields that supplied the corn for the urban dwellers. That civilization vanished circa 1400–1500 for unknown reasons. A severe earthquake that damaged Monk's Mound at that time might have challenged the supernatural powers claimed by the Cahokian chiefs. Cahokians might have also outstripped their water supply caused in part by large-scale deforestation, and the period of global cooling or mini Ice Age of the era might have caused recurring famines and migration. \n\nThe next major power in the region was the Illiniwek Confederation, a political alliance among several tribes. The Illiniwek gave Illinois its name. The Ho-Chunk, a Siouan people of the Chiwere subgroup & the alleged oldest continuous Siouan society, were also believed to claim some land north of the Rock River. During the Beaver Wars period of the 17th century, the Iroquois pushed through and briefly conquered Ohio, Indiana & Southern Michigan, forcing several peoples out of those regions. Several migrating groups of Miami & Mascouten-- the oldest known inhabitants of Indiana & S. Michigan-- spread throughout the western Great Lakes & Upper Mississippi region, living wherever they could. The known tribes were the Miami, Mascouten, Wea, Atchatchakangouen, Pepicokia, Mengakonkia, Pinakashaw & Kilatika. The Beaver Wars also caused a secondary conflict in the greater Wisconsin area known as the Second Fauk War, which pushed the ancestors of the Lakota/ Dakota out onto the plains & destabilized the Dakotas. \n\nThe French, who arrived during the 1670s- 80s and established the Illinois colony, helped to stabilize the region. The Miami & Mascouten subtribes merged back into two-- the Miami & Wea-- & returned to the east in the 1690s. In the aftermath of the Yamasee War (1715-1717) in the early 18th century, the French also offered aid to a breakaway group of Yuchi known as the Chisca, who had once resided in southeast Kentucky and had them migrate into Illiniwek territory. During the French & Indian War, English influence spread deep into and destabilized the Illinois Colony. The largely Algonquian-ized Chisca split away and returned to Kentucky, taking several of the Illiniwek peoples with them (although, some remained) and became known as the Kispoko. The Kispoko soon after merged with the Shawnee. Later, the remaining Illiniwek were pushed out onto the Great Plains, alike many other tribes and were broken down as several peoples fought for adequate land. Today, the remaining Illiniwek are part of a single tribe-- the Peoria of Oklahoma. \n\nFrench explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet explored the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers in 1673. As a result of their exploration, the Illinois Country was part of the French empire until 1763, when it passed to the British. The area was ceded to the new United States in 1783 and became part of the Northwest Territory.\n\nThe Illinois-Wabash Company was an early claimant to much of Illinois. An early western outpost of the United States, Fort Dearborn, was established in 1803 (at the site of present-day Chicago), and the creation of the Illinois Territory followed on February 3, 1809.\n\nOn December 3, 1818, Illinois became the 21st U.S. state. Early U.S. expansion began in the south part of the state and quickly spread northward, driving out the native residents. In 1832, some Native American \"Indians\" returned from Iowa but were driven out in the Black Hawk War, fought by militia.\n\nIllinois is known as the \"Land of Lincoln\" because it is here that the 16th President spent his formative years. Chicago gained prominence as a lake and canal port after 1848, and as a rail hub soon afterward. By 1857, Chicago was the state's dominant metropolis. (see History of Chicago).\n\nThe state has a varied history in relation to slavery and the treatment of African Americans in general. The French had black slaves from 1719 to as late as the 1820s. Slavery was nominally banned by the Northwest Ordnance, but that was not enforced. But when Illinois became a sovereign state in 1818, the Ordenance no longer applied, and there were about 900 slaves there. As the southern part of the state, known as \"Egypt\", was largely settled by migrants from the South, the section was hostile to free blacks and allowed settlers to bring slaves with them for labor. Proslavery elements tried to call a convention to legalize slavery, but they were blocked by Governor Edward Coles who mobilized anti-slavery forces, warning that rich slave owners would buy up all the good farm lands. A referendum in 1823 showed 60% of the voters opposed slavery, so efforts to make slavery official failed. Nevertheless, some slaves were brought in seasonally or as house servants as late as the 1840s. The Illinois Constitution of 1848 was written with a provision for exclusionary laws to be passed. In 1853, state senator John A. Logan helped pass a law to prohibit all African Americans, including freedmen, from settling in the state. After 1865 Logan reversed positions and became a leading advocate of civil rights for blacks.\n\nIn 1839, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, created a settlement they named Nauvoo. By 1840 church leadership envisioned Nauvoo as an economic, cultural and spiritual center--a religious utopia guided by church leaders. The city, situated on a prominent bend along the Mississippi River, quickly grew to 12,000 inhabitants, and was for a time rivaling for the title of largest city in Illinois. By the early 1840s, the Latter Day Saints built a large stone temple in Nauvoo, one of the largest buildings in Illinois at the time, which was completed in 1846. In 1844 Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, was killed in nearby Carthage, Illinois. In 1846, the Latter-day Saints under Brigham Young left Illinois for what would become Utah, but what was still then Mexican territory. A small breakaway group remained, but Nauvoo fell largely into abandonment. Nauvoo today has many restored buildings from the 1840s.\n\nDuring the Civil War, over 250,000 Illinois men served in the Union Army, coming 4th in the states. Starting with President Lincoln's first call for troops and continuing throughout the war, Illinois sent 150 infantry regiments; they were numbered from the 7th IL to the 156th IL. Seventeen cavalry regiments also served as well as two light artillery regiments. The most well worked soldier was Ulysses S. Grant of Galena. Throughout the war the Republicans were in control, under the firm leadership of Governor Richard Yates The Democrats had a strong Copperhead element that opposed the war and tried in local areas to disrupt the draft. In Chicago, Wilbur F. Storey made his Democratic newspaper the \"Chicago Times\" into Lincoln's most vituperative enemy.\n\nIn the 20th century, Illinois emerged as one of the most important states in the Union. Edward F. Dunne was a Chicago Democrat and leader of the progressive movement, who served as governor 1913–1917. He was succeeded by Frank O. Lowden, who led the war effort and was Republican presidential hopeful in 1920.\n\nDemocrat Adlai Stevenson served as governor in 1948–1952. William G. Stratton led a Republican statehouse in the 1950s. In 1960 Otto Kerner, Jr. led the Democrats back to power. He promoted economic development, education, mental health services, and equal access to jobs and housing. In a federal trial in 1973, Kerner was convicted on 17 counts of bribery while he was governor, plus other charges; he went to prison. Richard B. Ogilvie, a Republican, won in 1968. Bolstered by large Republican majorities in the state house, Ogilvie embarked upon a major modernization of state government. He successfully advocated for a state constitutional convention, increased social spending, and secured Illinois' first state income tax. The latter was particularly unpopular with the electorate, and the modest Ogilvie lost a close election to the flashy Democrat Dan Walker in 1972.\nThe state constitutional convention of 1970 wrote a new document that was approved by the voters. It modernized government and ended the old system of three-person districts which froze the political system in place.\n\nWalker did not repeal the income tax that Ogilvie had enacted and wedged between machine Democrats and Republicans had little success with the Illinois legislature during his tenure. In 1987 he was convicted of business crimes not related to his governorship. In the 1976 gubernatorial election, Jim Thompson, a Republican prosecutor from Chicago won 65 percent of the vote over Michael Howlett. Thompson was reelected in 1978 with 60 percent of the vote, defeating State Superintendent Michael Bakalis. Thompson was very narrowly reelected in 1982 against former U.S. Senator Adlai E. Stevenson III, and then won decisively against him in a rematch in 1986.\n\nThompson was succeeded by Republican Jim Edgar who won a close race in 1990 against his Democratic opponent, attorney general Neil Hartigan, and was reelected in 1994 by a wide margin against another Democratic opponent, state comptroller and former state senator Dawn Clark Netsch. In the elections of 1992 and 1994, the Republicans succeeded in capturing both houses of the state legislature and all statewide offices, putting Edgar in a very strong political position. He advocated increases in funding for education along with cuts in government employment, spending and welfare programs. He was succeeded by yet another Republican, George H. Ryan. Ryan worked for extensive repairs of the Illinois Highway System called \"Illinois FIRST\". FIRST was an acronym for \"Fund for Infrastructure, Roads, Schools, and Transit\". Signed into law in May 1999, the law created a $6.3 billion package for use in school and transportation projects. With various matching funds programs, Illinois FIRST provided $2.2 billion for schools, $4.1 billion for public transportation, another $4.1 billion for roads, and $1.6 billion for other projects. In 1993 Illinois became the first Midwestern state to elect a black person to the US senate before the term of Carol Moseley Braun.\n\nRyan gained national attention in January 2003 when he commuted the sentences of everyone on or waiting to be sent to death row in Illinois—a total of 167 convicts—due to his belief that the death penalty was incapable of being administered fairly. Ryan's term was marked by scandals; he was convicted of corruption in federal court and sent to prison.\n\nRod Blagojevich, elected in 2002, was the first Democratic governor in a quarter century. Illinois was trending sharply toward the Democratic party in both national and state elections. After the 2002 elections, Democrats had control of the House, Senate, and all but one statewide office. Blagojevich signed numerous pieces of progressive legislation such as ethics reform, death penalty reform, a state Earned Income Tax Credit, and expansions of health programs like KidCare and FamilyCare. Blagojevich signed a bill in 2005 that prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment, housing, public accommodations, and credit. Other notable actions of his term include a strict new ethics law and a comprehensive death penalty reform bill. Despite an annual budget crunch, Blagojevich oversaw an increase in funding for health care every year without raising general sales or income taxes. Republicans claimed that he simply passed the state's fiscal problems on to future generations by borrowing to balance budgets. Indeed, the 2005 state budget called for paying the bills by shorting the state employees' pension fund by $1.2 billion, which led to a backlash among educators. In December 2008, Blagojevich was arrested on charges of conspiracy and solicitation to commit bribery with regard to appointing a U.S. Senator. He was convicted in federal court and sent to prison.\n\nPat Quinn became governor on January 29, 2009, after Blagojevich was removed from office. Quinn was elected to a full term in office in the 2010 gubernatorial election. As governor he faced severe short-term budget shortfalls and a long-term state debt, all in the context of the worst national economic slump since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Quinn has pushed for spending cuts and tax increases, while trying to raise ethical standards, protect public-sector labor unions, and maintain environmental standards. Quinn faced a state with a reputation for corruption—the two previous governors both went to federal prison—and after two years polls showed Quinn himself was the \"Nation's most unpopular governor.\" Quinn in 2012 feared Illinois was \"on the verge of a financial meltdown because of pension systems eating up every new dollar and health care costs climbing through the roof.\" The state for decades had underfunded its pension system for state employees. By early 2013 the main issue remained a financial crisis in meeting the state's budget and its long-term debt as the national economic slump—the Great Recession—continued and Illinois did poorly in terms of creating jobs. In May 2013, Illinois' state (public) universities, colleges, and community colleges agreed, pending formation and passage of the legislation before the end of the state's legislative session, at Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan and other members' repeated urging, to gradually assume more of the burden- half of a percent of the retirement and pension costs per fiscal year starting in 2015 (it would likely take roughly 10 to 20 years for them to assume the full cost; school districts likely will have to do the same at some point- Chicago Public Schools already bear the entire cost). Programs will likely be cut, tuition will probably keep on being raised too, and property taxes also might well increase, but it would make a sizable dent in the almost $100 billion unfunded retiree pension liability that is a large part of the state's fiscal crisis.\n\nMost pre-1940 names have been selected from the WPA Guide This is a list of people from Illinois; people are not included if they left the state before beginning a career.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2307422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2307422", "title": "Super President", "text": "Super President\n\nSuper President is an American animated cartoon that aired Saturday mornings on NBC from September 16, 1967 to December 28, 1968. The series was produced by the DePatie–Freleng animation company.\n\nIn the show, the President of the United States has inhuman superpowers, including increased strength and the ability to change his molecular composition, and uses them to protect the free world, as well as his hapless Vice President. The show was relentlessly criticized for its bad taste and low quality, and was cancelled after thirty episodes, midway through its second season.\n\nThe President of the United States, former Astronaut James Norcross (voiced by Paul Frees) is given superpowers as the result of a cosmic storm during a space mission. The future President gains increased strength and the Metamorpho-like ability to change his molecular composition at will to any form required (like granite, steel, ozone, water and even electricity). A hidden panel in the Oval Office allows him access to his secret base, a hidden cave beneath the \"Presidential Mansion\" (a somewhat modified White House). Super President travels either by using a futuristic automobile/aircraft/submarine called the Omnicar, or by using jets built into his belt.\n\nDespite the fact that the character's name is \"Super President,\" for some reason only Norcross' chubby, pipe-smoking advisor Jerry Sales knows that the leader of the Free World is also a red and white-costumed superhero in his off-hours.\n\nA total of thirty episodes of \"Super President\" were produced. Two episodes appeared in each show. Each episode also included an episode of \"Spy Shadow\" starring secret agent Richard Vance (voiced by Ted Cassidy) who had learned in Tibet how to command his shadow (also voiced by Ted Cassidy) to act independently of himself, an ability he put to good use as an Interspy operative battling a variety of villains, including the evil forces of S.P.I.D.E.R. (\"Society for Plunder, International Disorder, Espionage and Racketeering\"). Spy Shadow had the power to slip through small openings, hide himself in another person's shadow, and was invulnerable to harm thanks to his insubstantial nature, but his fists remained decidedly solid. Spy Shadow's only weakness is the inability to appear in total darkness for \"there can be no shadow without light\".\n\n\"Super President\" came under fire from critics and TV watchdog groups, including Action for Children's Television, for its depiction of a national leader who was an invincible superhuman. The National Association of Broadcasters said, \"An all-time low in bad taste, with the President of the United States in a Superman role. NBC was responsible for this direct ideological approach to totalitarianism. We fear that there may be other broadcasters who are irresponsible enough to keep it in circulation.\"\n\nIn \"The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows\", David Perlmutter says that the show is \"perhaps the worst animated program in the late 1960s (its producers admitted it themselves),\" and calls the superhero president \"arguably the most implausible superhero narrative idea ever invented.\" \n\n\n\nKevin Scott Collier. \"The Animated Administration of James Norcross, a.k.a.

{"id": "2307434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2307434", "title": "Martingale (tack)", "text": "Martingale (tack)\n\nA martingale is any of several designs of tack that are used on horses to control head carriage. Martingales may be seen in a wide variety of equestrian disciplines, both riding and driving. Rules for their use vary widely; in some disciplines they are never used, others allow them for schooling but not in judged performance, and some organizations allow certain designs in competition. \n\nThe two most common types of martingale, the standing and the running, are used to control the horse's head height, and to prevent the horse from throwing its head so high that the rider gets hit in the face by the horse's poll or upper neck. When a horse's head gets above a desired height, the martingale places pressure on the head so that it becomes more difficult or impossible to raise it higher.\n\nThe standing martingale, also known as a \"tiedown\" or a \"head check\", has a single strap which is attached to the girth, passes between the horse's front legs and is fixed to the back of the noseband. To prevent it from catching on other objects, it also has a neck strap. A variation is attached to a breastplate in lieu of a neck strap. When correctly fitted for English riding, it should be possible to push the martingale strap up to touch the horse's throatlatch.\n\nA variation of the standing martingale, called a \"tiedown\", is seen almost exclusively in the western riding disciplines. A tiedown is adjusted much shorter than a standing martingale and is intended primarily to prevent the horse from flipping its head up when asked to abruptly stop or turn in speed events. Users also claim that it gives the horse something to brace against for balance. It consists of an adjustable strap, one end which attaches to the horse's breastplate and the other which attaches to a noseband on the bridle. The noseband can be of leather, but may also be of lariat rope, or even plastic-covered cable, which can make the western tiedown considerably harsher than the English-style standing martingale. It is properly adjusted when it puts no pressure on the horse's nose when held at a normal position, but will immediately act if the horse raises its nose more than a few inches.\n\nWith both pieces of equipment, the slack is taken up out of the strap when the horse raises its head above the desired point, and pressure is placed on the horse's nose. \n\nThe standing martingale is competition legal for show hunter and hunt seat equitation riders over fences in the US, show jumping competitions in the UK, and is permissible and in common use in fox hunting, polocrosse, horseball, and polo. It is also seen on some military and police horses, partly for style and tradition, but also in the event of an emergency that may require the rider to handle the horse in an abrupt manner. It is not legal for flat classes. The tiedown is commonly seen in rodeo and speed events such as gymkhana games, but is not show legal in any other western-style horse show competition.\n\nThe standing martingale is more restrictive than the running martingale because it cannot be loosened in an emergency. A horse that trips in a standing martingale could potentially fall more easily because its range of motion is restricted. If a horse falls wearing an incorrectly fitted standing martingale, the animal cannot extend its neck fully, plus will have a more difficult time getting back up.\n\nDue to the risk of injury to the cartilage of the nose, the martingale strap is never attached to a drop noseband. Because of the risk of both nose and jaw injuries, it also should not be attached to any type of \"figure 8\" or \"grackle\" noseband. A standing martingale can be attached to the cavesson (the upper, heavier strap) of a flash noseband, but not to the lower, \"flash\" or \"drop\" strap. \n\nAny martingale may cause pain to the horse if misused in combination with certain other equipment. If used in conjunction with a gag bit, a standing martingale can trap the head of the horse, simultaneously asking the horse to raise and lower its head and providing no source of relief in either direction. This combination is sometimes seen in polo, in some rodeo events, and occasionally in the lower levels of jumping. \n\nOveruse or misuse of a martingale or tiedown, particularly as a means to prevent a horse from head-tossing, can lead to the overdevelopment of the muscles on the underside of the neck, creating an undesirable \"upside down\" neck that makes it more difficult for the horse work properly under saddle. It may also lead to the horse tensing the back muscles and moving incorrectly, especially over fences. This may put excessive pressure on the horse's spine, reduce the shock-absorbing capacity of the leg anatomy, and can over time lead to lameness. There is also a risk of accidents: If a horse is sufficiently \"trapped\" by a combination of a too-short martingale and too-harsh bit, the horse may attempt to rear and, inhibited by the action of the martingale, fall, potentially injuring both horse and rider.\n\nThe \"running martingale\" consists of a strap which is attached to the girth and passes between the horse's front legs before dividing into two pieces. At the end of each of these straps is a small metal ring through which the reins pass. It is held in the correct position by a neck strap or breastplate.\n\nA running martingale is adjusted so that each of the \"forks\" has about an inch of slack when the horse holds its head in the normal position. When correctly adjusted, the reins make a straight line from the rider's hand to the bit ring when the horse's head in at the correct height and the running martingale is not in effect.\n\nWhen the horse raises its head above the desired point, the running martingale adds leverage through the reins to the bit on the bars of the horse's mouth. The leverage created by this pressure encourages the horse to lower its head. A running martingale provides more freedom for the horse than a standing martingale, as the rider can release pressure as soon as the desired result is achieved. Additionally, if a horse happens to trip on landing after a fence, the rider can loosen the reins and the horse will have full use of its head and neck. \n\nBecause of this safety factor, the running martingale is the only style of martingale permitted for use in eventing competitions and horse racing. Some show jumpers also prefer the running martingale due to the extra freedom it provides. Running martingales are also used outside of the competition arena on young horses being trained in the Saddle seat, western riding, and many other disciplines. \n\nThe German martingale, also called a Market Harborough, consists of a split fork that comes up from the chest, runs through the rings of the bit and attaches to rings on the reins of the bridle between the bit and the rider's hand. It acts in a manner similar to a running martingale, but with additional leverage. It is not show legal and is used primarily as a training aid.\n\nA running martingale is generally used with rein stops, which are rubber or leather stops slipped onto the rein between the bit and the ring of the martingale. Rein stops are compulsory at Pony Club and British Eventing Events. They are an important safety feature that stops the martingale from sliding too far forward and getting caught on the bit ring or on the buckles or studs that attach the reins to the bit. Sanctioning organizations require a running martingale to be used in conjunction with rein stops if the reins are buckled to the bit. \n\nThe primary difficulty in use of a running martingale is the inability to raise the horse's head in the event of the animal bucking. If adjusted too short, lateral use of the reins may be impeded. If used improperly, the force exerted by the running martingale on the horse's mouth can be severe and for this reason the standing martingale is preferred in some circles. Improper use includes use on the reins of a curb bit; adjustment too short, so that the equipment pulls the horse's head below the proper position.\n\nThe Irish martingale is not a true martingale in the sense of a device that affects the rider's control over the horse. Thus, it is sometimes known as a semi-martingale. It is a simple short strap with a ring on either end. The reins are each run through a ring on either side before being buckled. The Irish martingale's purpose is not to control the head, but to prevent the reins from coming over the horse's head, risking entanglement, should a rider fall. It is used mostly in European horse racing.\n\n"}

She is best known for her role as Opal Cortlandt on the ABC daytime soap opera, \"All My Children\".\n\nLarson was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the daughter of Ruth Evangeline (née Boyce), an interior decorator, and John Charles Larson, an aerospace engineer. She has three sisters. Larson attended the same high school as Dorothy Lyman, who played Opal on \"All My Children\" before her. She enrolled at the University of Minnesota (eventually, she finished her education at Hunter College), and began singing in nightclubs with a group called Just Us. It was not long before Just Us was discovered and headed to New York City, where they recorded several soundtracks, including the one for the film, \"Rachel, Rachel\", starring Joanne Woodward.\n\nLarson and her sister traveled throughout Europe in a bus, before she settled in Paris, France. She became a model, and was soon appearing in major American and European fashion spreads. While in Paris, she also landed her first film role (as a Swedish au pair) in \"Deadly Trap\", starring Faye Dunaway and Frank Langella. Her next film role was as Jeanne Moreau's rival for her character's younger lover in the film, \"Dear Louise\".\n\nLarson made her Broadway debut in \"Death and the King's Horseman\" (1987).

Designed by and manufactured at the Italian \"carrozzeria\" Pininfarina factory, the monocoque, front-engine, rear drive \"Sport Spider\" debuted at the November 1966 Turin Auto Show with styling by Tom Tjaarda.\n\nFiat later marketed the car as the Spider 2000 (1979-1982). After being retired by FIAT, Pininfarina continued the production of the model under his own brand as Pininfarina Spider Azzura for the North American market and Pininfarina Spidereuropa for the European market for three more years, from 1983 until 1985.\n\nHonoring its legacy, in 2015 a successor of the Fiat 124 Spider was presented at the LA Auto Show.\n\nThe Fiat 124 Sport Spider was designed by Pininfarina and styled in-house by Tom Tjaarda. The 124 Sport Spider, 124 Sport Coupé and 124 sedan share much of their running gear – and, in the case of the coupé, platforms. The Sports Spider uses a shorter platform along with a shorter wheelbase, and in contrast to the Pinifarina styled and manufactured spider, Fiat designed and manufactured the coupé in-house.\n\nThe succession of build series of the 124 were designated internally as AS, BS, BS1, CS and CSA. AS models had a torque tube transmitting power to the rear wheels; this crack-prone design was replaced by a trailing-arm rear axle with the second series (BS) during 1969 — which was manufactured alongside the AS for the first six months of 1970. The early AS cars also have smaller taillights, while the BS receives a mesh grille and black-rimmed gauges inside. In July 1970 the 1.6-liter BS1 appeared; this model is recognizable by its twin humps on the bonnet and bumper overriders. The CS series Spider arrived during 1972. Also in 1972, a sports version of the Spider debuted, required for type-approval of its rally version, and was marketed as 124 CSA (C-Spider-Abarth). The vehicle has a capacity of 128 hp. In three years, Fiat manufactured less than 1000 CSA models, which were intended for sale to individual clients.\n\nThe car was manufactured by Fiat (with a Pininfarina body) in Turin until October 1981, when Pininfarina took over manufacture in their San Giorgio Canavese plant. Serial numbers started over from zero, while the eleventh digit in the Vehicle Identification Number was switched from an 8 to a 5. The Fiat Spider 2000 ended manufacture in July 1982, and after the Italian summer holidays production of Pininfarina-badged cars commenced in its place.\n\nThe four-cylinder engine used in the spider and coupé is a double overhead cam, aluminum crossflow head version of the sedan's pushrod unit. It started in 1966 with a capacity of 1438 cc progressively increasing to 1608 cc in 1970 (although this was reduced to 1,592 cc in 1973), 1,756 cc in 1974 and finally 1,995 cc in 1979. The Fiat Twin Cam engine was designed by ex-Ferrari engineer Aurelio Lampredi. Bosch fuel injection replaced the previously used Weber carburetors midway through 1980. In 1981 and 1982, Fiat USA, Inc. partnered with Legend Industries to create approximately 700 turbo models for US markets. There was also a supercharged model called \"Volumex\" offered toward the end of production, which was sold only in Europe, where it cost 35% more than a regular, fuel-injected Spidereuropa. This family of engines remained in production into the 1990s giving it one of the longest production-runs in automotive history. The double overhead cam (DOHC) version was the first mass manufactured DOHC to utilize reinforced rubber timing belts, an innovation that would come into nearly universal use in the decades after its introduction. Its family powered race cars such as the FIAT 131 Mirafiori, 124 Special T, Lancia Beta Montecarlo, Delta Integrale and many others.\n\nSuspension is conventional by unequal length wishbones and coil over damper at the front and by coil sprung live rear axle at the rear which is located by a transverse link (Panhard rod) and two pairs of forward extending radius rods to react to braking and acceleration forces, and to control axle wind-up.\n\nThe coupé and spider were marketed in the Canada and US beginning in 1968. In 1969, the Spider featured four-wheel disc-brakes, double overhead cams, hesitation wipers, steering-column mounted lighting-controls, radial-ply tyres and a five-speed manual transmission. An optional three-speed automatic transmission from General Motors was available from 1979 through 1985 for North America as well as Japan. The Spider's convertible top was known for its simplicity of use — allowing a seated driver to quickly raise or lower the top. When the engine was upgraded to two litres, the model was renamed the \"Fiat 2000 Spider.\" For the 1980 model year a version with a catalytic converter and Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection was introduced for California and optional in the other 49 states. For 1981 this engine, with , became standard fitment in North America.\n\nFiat subsequently stopped marketing the Spider and the X1/9 — to have their marketing assumed by their respective \"carrozzerie\". In Europe, the Ritmo Cabrio was also marketed by Bertone rather than Fiat themselves. In the US, Fiat turned over marketing and support of the Spider and the X1/9 to International Automobile Importers, Inc., headed by Malcolm Bricklin.\n\nThe Fiat Abarth 124 Rally is a street legal rally version of the 124 Sport Spider sold to the masses, known also as \"124 Abarth Stradale\", introduced in November 1972.\nIts main purpose was to receive FIA homologation in the special grand touring cars (group 4) racing class, and replace the 1.6-litre Fiat Sport Spider rally cars which were presently being campaigned. At the time 124 had already won the 1972 European Rally Championship at the hands of Raffaele Pinto and Gino Macaluso.\nThe 124 Rally was added to the Sport Spider range, which included the 1600 and 1800 models; the first 500 examples produced were earmarked for the domestic Italian market.\n\nAmongst the most notable modifications over the standard spider there were independent rear suspension, engine upgrades, lightweight body panels, and a rigid hard top.\n\nIn place of the usual rear solid axle, there is independent suspension from lower wishbones, the original trailing arms, an upper strut and an anti-roll bar. At the front a radius rod on each side was added to the standard double wishbones.\n\nThe Abarth-tuned type \"132 AC 4.000\" 1.8-litre, twin-cam engine was brought from the standard 118 to by replacing the standard twin-choke carburettor with double vertical twin-choke Weber 44 IDFs, and by fitting an Abarth exhaust with a dual exit muffler. The 9.8:1 compression ratio was left unchanged.\n\nThe transmission is the all-synchronised five-speed optional on the other Sport Spider models, and brakes are discs on all four corners.\nDespite the four-point roll bar fitted, kerb weight is , roughly less than the regular 1.8-litre Sport Spider.\n\nEngine bonnet, boot lid and the fixed hard top are fibreglass, painted matt black, the rear window is perspex and the doors aluminium. Front and rear bumpers were deleted and replaced by simple rubber bumperettes. A single matte black wing mirror was fitted.\nMatte black wheel arch extensions house Pirelli CN 36 tyres on four-spoke alloy wheels.\nInside centre console, rear occasional seats, and glovebox lid were eliminated; while new features were anodised aluminium dashboard trim, a small three-spoke leather-covered Abarth steering wheel, and Recaro corduroy-and-leather bucket seats as an extra-cost option.\nThe car carries Fiat badging front and rear, Abarth badges and \"Fiat Abarth\" scripts on the front wings, and Abarth wheel centre caps.\nOnly three paint colours were available: Corsa red, white, and light blue.\n\nIn 1971 the 124 Spider was prepared for the World Rally Championship when Abarth became involved with its production and development. Abarth designer Ing. Colucci was responsible for getting the 124 Spider into Group 4 rally trim. Over this period the Abarth Spider was relatively successful with wins at the 1972 Hessen Rally, Acropolis Rally, 1973 Polish Rally, 19th on the 1973 RAC rally and seventh to mostly the Alpine Renaults on the 1973 Monte Carlo Rally. The Spider continued to perform with first, second and third in the 1974 eighth Portuguese TAP Rally, sixth in the 1974 1000 Lakes, fourth in the 1975 Monte Carlo Rally and also with Markku Alén driving the spider to third place. By 1976 the days of 124 rallying were numbered due to the appearance of the Fiat-Abarth 131.\n\nThe model ended in 1985 after almost 200,000 spiders alone had been manufactured, with 75% for the US market. There were nine models of the spider, the AS, BS, BS1, CS, CSA (Abarth), CS1, CS2, CS0, and DS.\n\nThe 124 name was revived in 2016 through a joint venture with Mazda, using the new Mazda MX-5 platform. After considering possibly marketing the result as an Alfa Romeo Spider, the car was brought to the market as a Fiat. It was unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November 2015 and made available in late 2016. The engine is a turbocharged 1.4 MultiAir with 160 HP (119 kW) from the Fiat range.\n\n"}

Using the multibeam echosounder system and direct measurement by an ultra-deep-sea lander a maximum water depth of ± at for the Dordrecht Deep was recorded. Later analysis confirmed that the Dordrecht Deep with an extent of 80 × 95 km and a maximum depth of about at was the deepest location in the fracture zone. At the position of the Diamantina Deep, the water depth was only . This was shallower than previously thought, and confirmed that the Sunda Trench, rather than the Diamantina Fracture Zone, contains the deepest point in the Indian Ocean.

Indeed, much of the route comprises roads that were formerly part of the N7 between the cities, prior to motorway and other bypasses. Some of the R445 route also comprises local link roads to new N7/M7 route sections.\n\nThe official description of the R445 from the \"Roads Act 1993 (Classification of Regional Roads) Order 2012\" reads:\n\nBetween its junction with N7 at Maudlings in the county of Kildare and its junction with N80 at Stradbally Road in the town of Portlaoise in the county of Laois via Dublin Road, Poplar Square, Main Street and Limerick Road in the town of Naas: Newhall, Buckleys Cross: Liffey Bridge, Main Street and Edward Street in the town of Droichead Nua; and Ballymany Cross; Dublin Street and Claregate Street in the town of Kildare; Cherryville Cross, Mayfield (including link road to M7); Mooreabbey and Dublin Street in the town of Monasterevin; and Clogheen in the county of Kildare: Kilinure, Ballybrittas, Cappakeel, New Inn Cross, Greatheath, Ballydavis; Rathbrennan and Dublin Road in the town of Portlaoise in the county of Laois \n\nand\n\nbetween its junction with N80 at Abbeyleix Road in the town of Portlaoise and its junction with N62 at Benamore in the county of North Tipperary via Grattan Street in the town of Portlaoise; Clonboyne, Cloncourse; Portlaoise Road, Main Street, Market Square, Bridge Street and Patrick Street at Mountrath; Holy Cross, Moorefield Cross, Rush Hall, Derrin Cross, Borris-in-Ossory and Ballaghmore Lower in the county of Laois: and Cooleeshill in the county of Offaly \n\nand\n\nbetween its junction with the N62 at Parkmore in the county of North Tipperary and its junction with N52 at Tullahedy via Inane in the county of North Tipperary Ouris and Busherstown in the county of Offaly: Greenhills in the county of North Tipperary: Moneygall in the county of Offaly: Toomevara, Clashnevin, Lisbunny: Dublin Road, Thomas MacDonagh Street, Pearse Street, Kickham Street, Ashe Road and Clare Street in the town of Nenagh: and Springfort Cross in the county of North Tipperary\n\nand\n\nbetween its junction with N52 at Lissenhall in the county of North Tipperary and its junction with the N18 at Cratloemoyle in the county of Clare via Ballinteenoe, Kilmastulla, Gortybrigane and Birdhill in the county of North Tipperary: Dalys Cross, Mountshannon, Annacotty and Groody Bridge in the county of Limerick: Parkway Roundabout, Dublin Road, Clare Street, Lock Quay, Abbey River Bridge, Northern Relief Road, Castle Street, Thomond Bridge, High Road, Sexton Street North, Northern Ring Road, Ennis Road, Caherdavin Cross and Ennis Road in the city of Limerick: Lansdowne Bridge at the boundary between the city of Limerick and the County of Clare: and Meelick in the county of Clare.\n\nAncillary roads constructed as part of the N7 \"Naas Road\" widening and junction separation scheme are classified as the R445. These offer local access to Johnstown and Kill. They connect to the existing R445 at \"Maudlin's Interchange\" (Junction 9 on the N7, start of the M7 motorway).\n\nHere the R445 route follows the \"Dublin Road\" into Naas (this route was the N7 prior to the construction of the M7 in 1983). The route continues through Naas along \"Poplar Street\" and \"Main Street\", before leaving the town along the \"Limerick Road\". South of Naas, the R445 becomes a dual carriageway for and crosses the M7 motorway at Junction 10, continuing west to Newbridge along the town's \"Dublin Road\", crossing the River Liffey via \"Liffey Bridge\" onto \"Main Street\". The route continues along \"Edward Street\", leaving the town as the \"Kildare Road\". The R445 links to the M7 motorway at Junction 12, and crosses the Curragh beside the motorway before veering into Kildare Town. The route sections through Newbridge and Kildare formed the N7 until the extension of the M7 motorway between Junction 10 and Junction 13.\n\nThe R445 continues on the \"Dublin Road\" east of Kildare. This runs through the town via \"Dublin Street\", \"Claregate Street\" and the \"Limerick/Cork Road\". The R445 meets Junction 14 of the M7 motorway at \"Mayfield\". From here, the route continues west through Monasterevin via \"Mooreabbey\" and \"Dublin Street\". The R445 passes through Ballybrittas on the way to Portlaoise, meeting the M7 motorway again at Junction 16. The \"Dublin Road\" brings the R445 into Portlaoise where it joins the N80. The R445 begins again where it leaves the N80 at the junction of \"Grattan Street\" and \"Abbeyleix Road\", following the former street out of the town, to meet the M7/N7 at Junction 18.

The R445 passes through Nenagh via the \"Dublin Road\", \"Thomas MacDonagh Street\", \"Pierce Street\", \"Kickham Street\", \"Ash Road\" and \"Clare Street\". The route meets the N52 west of Nenagh. From the Carrigatogher Roundabout the R445 leaves the N52 road and continues along the old N7 route to Birdhill which was redesignated in April 2010. The route between Birdhill and Annacotty was redesignated as R445 in September 2010 following the opening of the Birdhill to Limerick section of the M7.\n\nOn 22 December 2010, following the opening of the M7 Castletown to Nenagh motorway project the old N7 route was reclassified as R445 from Borris-in-Ossory to Nenagh passing through the towns of Roscrea, Moneygall and Toomevara.\n\nFinally, the route through Limerick city, which formed the N7 prior to the opening of the \"Southern Ring Road\" in 2004, is also now the R445. \n\nThe route passes by Annacotty, and enters Limerick along the \"Dublin Road\" through Castletroy. The road crosses the \"Groody Bridge\" at the beginning of a new road section also opened in 2004 (also designated the N7 at the time). This brings the Dublin Road and R445 to the \"Parkway Roundabout\", where it meets the \"Childers Road\". The R445 continues as the \"Dublin Road\", \"Clare Street\" and \"Lock Quay\" before crossing the \"Abbey Bridge\" across the Abbey River. The R445 passes through King's Island as the \"Northern Relief Road\" and \"Castle Street\" (passing by King John's Castle). The route crosses the River Shannon via \"Thomond Bridge\" and follows \"High Street\", \"Sexton Street\" and the \"Northern Ring Road\" (past LIT). At \"Caherdavin Cross\" (\"Ivan's Cross\") the route follows the \"Ennis Road\" west out of the city to meet the N18 in County Clare at the \"Coonagh Roundabout\".\n\n"}

During the subsequent centuries, it was largely displaced by Spanish and evolved into some of the modern Nahuan languages in use today (other modern dialects descend more directly from other 16th-century variants). Although classified as an extinct language, Classical Nahuatl has survived through a multitude of written sources transcribed by Nahua peoples and Spaniards in the Latin script.\n\nClassical Nahuatl is one of the Nahuan languages within the Uto-Aztecan family. It is classified as a central dialect and is most closely related to the modern dialects of Nahuatl spoken in the valley of Mexico in colonial and modern times. It is probable that the Classical Nahuatl documented by 16th- and 17th-century written sources represents a particularly prestigious sociolect. That is to say, the variety of Nahuatl recorded in these documents is most likely to be more particularly representative of the speech of Aztec nobles (\"pīpiltin\"), while the commoners (\"mācēhualtin\") spoke a somewhat different variety.\n\nStress generally falls on the penultimate syllable. The one exception is the vocative case. When used by men it has the suffix -e, where stress falls on the final syllable, e.g. Cuāuhtliquetzqui (a name, meaning \"Eagle Warrior\"), but Cuāuhtliquetzqué \"O Cuauhtliquetzqui!\"\nWhen women use the vocative, the stress is shifted to the final syllable without adding any suffix.\n\"Oquichtli\" means \"man\", and \"Oquichtlí\" means \"O man!\"\n\nMaximally complex Nahuatl syllables are of the form CVC; that is, there can be at most one consonant at the beginning and end of every syllable. In contrast, English, for example, allows up to three consonants syllable-initially and up to four consonants to occur at the end of syllables (e.g. \"strengths)\" (\"ngths\" = ). Consonant clusters are only allowed word-medially, Nahuatl uses processes of both epenthesis (usually of /i/) and deletion to deal with this constraint.\n\nFor such purposes, \"tl\" , like all other affricates, is treated as a single sound, and not all consonants can occur in both syllable-initial and syllable-final position.\n\nAt the time of the Spanish conquest, Aztec writing used mostly pictograms supplemented with a few ideograms. When needed, it also used syllabic equivalences; Diego Durán recorded how the \"tlacuilos\" could render a prayer in Latin using this system but it was difficult to use. The writing system was adequate for keeping such records as genealogies, astronomical information, and tribute lists, but it could not represent a full vocabulary of spoken language in the way that the writing systems of the Old World or the Maya civilization's script could.\n\nThe Spanish introduced the Latin script, which was then used to record a large body of Aztec prose and poetry, which somewhat diminished the devastating loss caused by the burning of thousands of Aztec codices by the Spanish authorities.\n\nOn the , the language is written in a Latin script, including four letters with macrons or long vowels: ā, ē, ī, ō. Many other foreign letters such as \"b\" or \"k\" are used only in foreign names, such as in Francitlān (France).\n\nThe orthography used there is outlined below:\na c ch cu e hu i l* m n o p qu t tl tz x y z ā ē ī ō ll* h*\nNotes:\n\nNahuatl literature is extensive (probably the most extensive of all Indigenous languages of the Americas), including a relatively large corpus of poetry (see also Nezahualcoyotl). The \"Huei tlamahuiçoltica\" is an excellent early sample of literary Nahuatl.\n\nA bilingual dictionary with Spanish was first published in 1611, \"Vocabulario manual de las lenguas castellana y mexicana\" and is \"the most important and most frequently reprinted Spanish work on Nahuatl,\" according to the World Digital Library.\n\nNow, Classical Nahuatl is used by black metal groups of Mexico supporting \"indigenismo\", such as Kukulcan, Tlateotocani and Comando de Exterminio.\n"}

In 1951, Wheatley had played Sherlock Holmes in the first TV series about the fictional detective, but no recordings of it are known to exist.\n\nBorn in Tolworth, Surrey, the son of William Henry Wheatley, a bank clerk, and his wife Rose (née Towers), Alan Wheatley was initially an industrial psychologist. Later, he worked as a radio announcer before turning to stage and screen acting in the 1930s, as a player during the black-and-white era of film and television. Wheatley made his film debut in \"Conquest of the Air\" (1936), which remained unreleased for four years. During the Second World War, he worked for BBC Radio, as both an actor and an announcer.\n\nWheatley starred as Sherlock Holmes in the 1951 BBC TV series, which was the first such series though not the Holmes character's first appearance on television. The programme aired live for six episodes, and apparently no recordings were made. In the later Robin Hood series, Wheatley appeared regularly as the Sheriff in the first three seasons; in the fourth and final season, his role was mostly taken over by that of the Deputy Sheriff (John Arnatt) as a result of Wheatley's departure from the series. He also had roles in \"Danger Man\" and \"The Avengers\". Wheatley played the first character to be killed on-screen by a Dalek in \"Doctor Who\", when he appeared as Thal leader Temmosus in the 1963–64 serial \"The Daleks\".\n\nHis film credits include: \"Caesar and Cleopatra\" (1945), \"The Rake's Progress\" (1945), \"Appointment with Crime 1946, \"Brighton Rock\" (1947), \"Calling Paul Temple\" (1948), \"The Pickwick Papers\" (1952), \"Spaceways\" (1953), \"Simon and Laura\" (1955), \"A Jolly Bad Fellow\" (1964) and \"Tomorrow at Ten\" (1964) among others. He also appeared in \"Inn for Trouble\" (1960), a film spin-off of the TV comedy \"The Larkins\".\n\nWheatley was also a prolific stage actor. His theatre credits included Clifford Bax's \"The House of Borgia\" (1935), the lead in \"This Way to the Tomb\", and the tormented soul, Harry, in \"The Family Reunion\". He appeared in two versions of the thriller play \"Rope\", in 1950 and 1953, and starred as Abanazar in the Cole Porter musical pantomime \"Aladdin' at the London Coliseum \"in 1960. He also played the Abbé in a BBC radio adaptation of \"The Count of Monte Cristo\", with Andrew Sachs (as Dantes) in 1987, and the High Lama in the 1981 BBC Radio 4 \"Classic Serial\" version of \"Lost Horizon\", with Derek Jacobi as Hugh Conway.\n\nWheatley died in Westminster, London in 1991.\n"}

{"id": "2307506", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2307506", "title": "Rey Valera", "text": "Rey Valera\n\nReynaldo Valera Guardiano, better known as Rey Valera (born May 4, 1954 in Meycauayan, Bulacan, Philippines), is a Filipino singer, songwriter, music director, film scorer and television host. He wrote and produced songs that were recorded by various singers, most notably Sharon Cuneta. He is currently the head judge of the singing contest segment \"Tawag ng Tanghalan\" in a variety noontime show It's Showtime. He is the Cousin of Former Abra Governor Vicente P. Valera.\n\nRey Valera started his recording career in 1977 after becoming a band member from a group called Electric Hair Band for seven years. He waxed his first single as a solo singer – songwriter with the song \"Ako si Superman\", which he wrote supposedly for Rico Puno. His former boss at Vicor Records gave him the opportunity to sing his song and at the same time hired him as one of Vicor's in-house producers. Valera wrote the song \"Mr. D.J.\" and \"Kahit Maputi Na Ang Buhok Ko\" for Sharon Cuneta as part of the album \"DJ's Pet\", released in 1978.\n\nRey also made songs for other artists such as Rico Puno's \"Sorry Na, Pwede Ba\", \"Daigdig Ng Ala-ala\"; Geraldine's \"Pangako\"; Pol Enriquez' \"Ayoko na Sa 'Yo\" and many more. While he made songs for his peers, he made albums for himself such as \"Naaalala Ka\", \"Rey Valera Vol. 2\", \"Walang Kapalit\", \"Hello\", \"The Rey Valera Christmas Album\", \"Gabay Mo Ako\", \"Rey Valera's Greatest Hits Vol. 1\", \"Rey Valera's Greatest Hits Vol. 2\", \"Pirapirasong Ala-ala\", \"Sa Kabila Ng Lahat\", \"Kung Sakaling Iibig Muli\", \"FM Ka, AM Ako\", \"Home Sweet Home\", \"Ang Mahalaga\", etc. Most of these albums made golds and platinums.\n\nRecently, Vicor Music Corporation compiled Valera's recorded songs in their library in a 4-disc album entitled, \"Walang Kapalit\", as part of Vicor's 40th anniversary.\n\nHe was finally inducted to the Philippines Eastwood City Walk of Fame in 2009.\n\nHe won the MYX Magna Award 2015 in the recent 2015 MYX Music Awards.\n\nOne of his initial projects as a request from Tito Sotto who was the vice president of the Vicor Music Corporation at that time was to make a song for a twelve-year-old mayor's daughter named Sharon Cuneta. It was a daunting challenge, as Rey initially could not figure out what kind song would be fitting for her; she was too young to be taken seriously to be given a love song, and a bit too old to be given a nursery rhyme.\n\nIt dawned upon Rey to write a song about the people who were responsible for playing songs on the radio; the DJs. Wherever radio station the song would be submitted in, it was almost always guaranteed that it would be played as it was their song. The song, Mr. DJ,made remarkable sales on the chart.\n\nSharon stated in a recent interview by Deborah Kan in Star News Asia, that she has been always thankful for and grateful to Rey, for writing her first hit song. \"Mr. DJ\".\n\nThe two have been friends ever since, and in 1992, Sharon paid tribute to her favorite composer when she recorded Sharon Sings Valera.\n\nWhen Sharon Cuneta and her then husband Gabby Concepcion separated, Rey composed the song, \"Kahit Wala Ka Na\" (Even When You're Gone). When Sharon and Rey met at Cinema Audio, she asked why he was not writing songs for her anymore. Rey replied that he did write one for her and submitted the song to VIVA for it to be an inspiration or a battleground for Sharon. Both of them found out that the song has been shelved for two years at VIVA. Sharon immediately recorded the song and used it in her movie, \"Single Mother\"(former title). It was retitled to \"Kahit Wala Ka Na\".\n\nSharon's biggest blockbuster movies were lifted from popular songs of Rey, thus Sharon singing Valera has been an always-winning chemistry.\n\nIn 1983, Rey faced one of the worst challenges of both his career, and personal life; an impostor was using his name and was committing crimes, among them were car-napping and rape. The list even extended to marrying numerous women, and even petty crimes like \"borrowing\" money and personal items, all under Rey Valera's name. Rey made numerous newspaper statements announcing that there is an imposter posing as him. Rey also wrote and released a song entitled, \"My Fans Are in Trouble\" to warn his fans through the medium of music, with the lyrics depicting his helplessness to stop this impostor. What Rey feared most was not the money, but the physical harm people the impostor had fooled might do to him. Ultimately in 1984, Rey decided to quit show business at the peak of his career to protect his fans and also to make up for the time he lost with his family during his fame. When Rey made a comeback in 1988, he wore his hair long so that his impostor (who had kinky hair), would have a harder time posing as him if the impostor ever resurfaced. The impostor has never been heard from ever since.\n\nRey now talks about the impostor topic on less serious, even humorous tone, to help forget the traumatic experience it had caused. Looking back, he even dubbed his impostor \"Rey Bolero\" ( Rey the Deceiver / Smooth Talker ) when he talks about it to his friends and interviews, which was also mentioned on the \"Na-Scam Ka Na Ba\" interview on the Filipino television channel QTV11 which aired around September 2006.\n\nIn May 2008, a friendlier, funnier impostor had emerged on the Filipino television show Bubble Gang, in the persona of comedian/parodist Michael V. He even used \"Rey Bolero\" as his screen name. A segment of the show featured Michael V. as Rey Bolero, singing Mas Tanga 'ko Sa'yo ( I'm Dumber Than You Are ) – A parody of one of Rey Valera's well known songs, Pangako Sa'yo ( I Promise To You ). His costume was even patterned after Rey Valera's late 1970s attire.\n\nThe idea proved to be a hit, and a second Rey Valera song was soon used on the same show and segment, also by Michael V. himself. The song, \"Kung Kailangan Mo Ako\" ( If You Need Me ), was parodied into Kung Kailangan Mo Bato ( If You Need A Stone / To Get Stoned—a slang use of the word \"stone\", as in illegal substance / getting high )\n\nOn October 31 of the same year, Rey Valera, and Michael V. as Rey Bolero ( now mimicking Rey Valera's clothes and hairstyle at the time) performed a duet and was one of the highlights of the heavily promoted, \"taped as live\", two-part Bubble Gang 13th Anniversary special. A narration was heard before the two artists entered the stage; \"Do the singers that Michael V. impersonate ever get angry?\" – (translated from Tagalog). They sang a medley of the two previously mentioned parodied songs. The segment ended with Rey Valera mock-swinging his guitar at Michael V., and the former mock-chasing the latter towards the backstage.\n\nValera 's songs are also favorite titles and theme songs of soap operas like \"Ula, Batang Gubat\" (\"Malayo Pa Ang Umaga\"), \"Sa Sandaling Kailangan Mo Ako\" (\"Kung Kailangan Mo Ako\"), \"Pangako Sa 'Yo\" (\"Pangako\"), from ABS-CBN.\n\nRecently, Valera's song's have been revived as theme songs for soap operas. They are: Maging Sino Ka Man (which has spawned a second book, ), Walang Kapalit, Tayong Dalawa and Juan Dela Cruz from ABS-CBN. All of these ABS-CBN shows have turned into a massive hit, making them top-rating and be part of every Filipino's lives .\n\nRey was film scoring movies during his singing career, but after the trouble his impostor has caused, Rey focused on his musical directing career. He particularly liked scoring music for action films, giving fight scenes and chase sequences fast paced, rock-themed music, which reflects his roots as a rock band member.\n\nRey's songs made marks also as theme songs and movie titles. These include several Sharon Cuneta movies such as \"Maging Sino Ka Man\", \"Pangako sa 'Yo\", \"Kahit Wala Ka Na\", \"Tayong Dalawa\"; \"Sinasamba Kita\", \"Romansa\", \"Hiwalay\"; \"Carnap King\", \"Barumbado\", and \"Baby Ama\"; \"Pasong Tirad, The Gregorio del Pilar Story\", \"Tampisaw\".\n\nThere are very few people are aware that Rey wrote music for movies, even fewer are aware that he also wrote music for R-18 \"Bold\" films. He accepted making music for movies and considered it an opportunity, as these projects usually pitted his songwriting skills to follow fresh and often unusual themes and topics, often deviating from pop love songs which he was usually typecast into.\n\nThe theme song \"Ambon\" (Raindrop) from the film \"Tampisaw\" emphasizes on the singer's hunger and deprivation of love, and that a single \"raindrop\" of love would be enough for her to live on.\n\nThe theme song \"Nagpapanggap\" (Pretending/Deceiving) from the film \"Kerida\" (\"The Mistress\") depicts a person's awareness that her lover is only pretending to love her, and yet she has this pragmatic acceptance and is even thankful that she was loved, no matter how false that love may be.\n\nThe theme song \"Sa Gitna ng Buhay Ko\" (In The Middle of My Life) from the film \"Naglalayag\" (\"Silent Passage\") follows the movie's theme of a middle-aged woman falling in love with a man half her age. The song relates to her life as the times of the day, asking questions such as, \"why did love arrive at only NOON?\"\n\nIn 2002, Rey reunited with his contemporaries Rico J. Puno and Hajji Alejandro in a series of concerts called \"Greatest Hits\", highlighting the music of their own time. They also launched a VCD recording of their concert. Nonoy Zuñiga and Marco Sison joined the group in the following year. The group continues to perform both locally and internationally\n\nAlthough they were formally named \"The Greatest Hits\", the group felt that using the name \"The Greatest Hitmakers\" was more proper, as the former referred to the 'songs' and not the group members themselves. The group has successfully performed even with the absence of one or two members, usually concentrating on a core trio group ( e.g. Rey, Hajji, Rico / Rey, Hajji, Marco / Rey, Rico, Marco ) and varies between concert to concert, depending on each member's availability. This flexibility of the group's roster combined with miscommunication with the each show's promoter and other reasons has often led to various names for the group such as \"The Hitmakers\", \"The Greatest Hits\", \"The Great Hitmakers\" \"GH5\", \"GH4\" and such.\n\nIn July 2005, Rey Valera released the music album \"Panghabangbuhay\", with his children's band called \"Saling Ket\". Whenever possible, Rey has been performing with them in almost all of his performances and still continues to do so.\n\nOn November 9, 2006, Rey was inducted to Bulacan's own \"Walk of Fame\", in the \"Hardin ng Mga Bayani at Sining\" ( The Garden of the Heroes and Arts/Artists), Malolos City, Bulacan.\n\nRey was among the few Bulakeños who was given the title of \"Alagad ng Sining at Kultura ng Bulacan\", loosely translated as \"Disciple of the Arts and Culture of Bulacan\", or simply put, Great Artist of Bulacan.\n\nAn inductee was given a tile with his/her name on it, and a small pile of a then wet cement to leave a hand print. The names on the Walk of Fame embody the Bulakeños who have brought pride to Bulacan in the fields of arts and culture.\n\nIn December 2009, Rey is finally inducted to the \"Philippines Eastwood City Walk of Fame\" for contributing his singing & composing songs. \"Philippines Eastwood City Walk of Fame\" is similar to the \"Hollywood Walk of Fame\" in California, USA.\n\nOn August 17, 2007, Vina Morales won the First Asean IKon Champion with her interpretation of Valera's hit song, \"Pangako\". The song was used as a theme song for ABS-CBN's soap opera TV series, \"Pangako Sa 'Yo\" (2000) and its 2015 remake, which was also sung by Morales.\n\n Rey once again performed with Rico J. Puno, and Nonoy Zuniga, along with Claire de la Fuente, Eva Eugenio and Joey Albert at the Philippine International Convention Center under the name, Legends of OPM.Like its predecessor group, \"The Greatest Hitmakers\", the concept proved to be a hit, and a repeat performance was done on March 5 of the following year.\n\nRey won as the MYX Magna Award 2015 Winner for contributing his success as a composer, guitarist, musical director & singer and also a performer.\n\nLegend:\n\n( ) music score only\n( * ) music score and theme song\n( ** ) theme song only\n( *** ) movie title and theme song\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A six-time NBA All-Star forward, he was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2008. Nicknamed AD, he finished ninth on the all-time NBA scoring list at the time of his retirement. In 2010, he was appointed acting head coach of the Denver Nuggets in the absence of stricken head coach George Karl.\n\nDantley attended DeMatha Catholic High School in Hyattsville, Maryland, where he played under coach Morgan Wootten and assistant coach Terry Truax.\n\nDantley was a forward at Notre Dame from 1973 to 1976. He was a consensus first-team All-American in 1974–75 and 1975–76. He ranks second on Notre Dame's career scoring list with 2,223 points and holds the school record for free throws made (615) and free throws attempted (769).\n\nDantley had a stellar collegiate career for the Fighting Irish. As a freshman, he played an important role in one of the biggest games in college basketball history, Notre Dame's 1974 upset to end UCLA's record 88-game winning streak. That UCLA team, coached by John Wooden, featured Bill Walton, Jamaal Wilkes (then known as Keith Wilkes), and Dave Meyer.\n\nDantley led Notre Dame in scoring in 1974–75 (30.4 points per game) and 1975–76 (28.6 points per game), while also leading the team in rebounding those two seasons with marks of 10.2 and 10.1 rebounds per game, respectively. He was also the leading scorer on the 1976 US Olympic team that captured the gold medal in Montreal.\n\nDantley turned pro in 1976 after his third season at Notre Dame. He graduated from Notre Dame with a degree in economics in August 1978.\n\nIn the 1976 NBA draft Dantley was drafted sixth overall by the Buffalo Braves. He became the third Buffalo player in five years to receive the NBA Rookie of the Year Award when he won it after the 1977 season.\n\nBuffalo traded Dantley to the Indiana Pacers before the 1977–78 NBA season, making him the first NBA Rookie of the Year to be traded following his rookie season. Indiana traded him after 23 games to the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nHe stayed with the Lakers through the following season before being traded again, this time to the Utah Jazz. It was the third time in two years that he had been traded; the Jazz were his fourth team in as many years in the league.\n\nIn Utah, Dantley reached his peak establishing his reputation as a prolific scorer, twice leading the league in scoring (in 1981 and 1984). He averaged over 30 points per game each season between 1981 and 1984, though he missed 60 games in 1983 after tearing ligaments in his right wrist. In his seven years with the Jazz, Dantley picked up all six of his All-Star appearances and two All-NBA second-team honors. Dantley's 1980–1984 seasons include two of the top three and four of the top seven spots in true shooting percentage for players averaging at least 30 points per game.\n\nUtah traded Dantley to the Detroit Pistons after the 1986 season. Dantley was still an effective scorer but did not get as many shots with Isiah Thomas, Joe Dumars, Vinnie Johnson, and Bill Laimbeer all averaging at least 10 points per game. Dantley was knocked unconscious while diving for a loose ball in Game 7 of the 1987 Eastern Conference Finals. By starting the season with the 1988-89 Pistons, he is listed as a member of one of the top 10 teams in NBA history. Midway through the 1989 season Detroit traded Dantley to the Dallas Mavericks for Mark Aguirre due to personal conflicts with Isiah Thomas.\n\nDantley played two more seasons in the NBA before retiring after a 13-game stint with the Milwaukee Bucks in 1991.\n\nDantley finished his career with an average of 24.3 points per game. He scored his points with a mix of flat-footed mid-range jump shots, high-percentage opportunities close to the basket, and frequent trips to the free throw line. For his career, he shot .540 from the floor—16th in NBA history—and .818 from the free throw line. He led the league in free throws six times and ranks ninth all-time in that category. He shares the record with Wilt Chamberlain for most free throws made in a regular-season NBA game with 28.\n\nAlthough listed as a small forward due to his size, Dantley played primarily in the low post, similar to a power forward. \n\nOne of the all-time great free throw shooters, he had a set routine of four two-handed dribbles and two spins of the ball before every free throw. In addition, \"prior to each free throw, he would recite his mantra from junior high that adept lip readers couldn’t mistake: “Over the front rim, backspin, follow through.” Fundamentals were not lip service but a way of life for Dantley.\" \n\nHis ability to score in the low post was even more remarkable considering one of his legs is significantly shorter than the other. To compensate for the nearly 2 inch difference in leg length, he wore custom-made inserts in his shoes. \n\nUtah retired Dantley's uniform number (#4) on April 11, 2007.\n\nDantley enjoyed outstanding success at every level of basketball, including high school, college, Olympics, and the NBA. On April 7, 2008, he was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame, 16 years after he retired.\n\nDantley was an assistant basketball coach at then-Towson State from August 1993 to 1996. Dantley had played for Towson head coach Terry Truax in high school.\n\nDantley later worked for the Denver Nuggets as an assistant coach for eight seasons. He briefly served as the team's head coach during the 2009–10 NBA season, filling in for George Karl, who was fighting cancer.\n\nIn addition to playing professionally, in his spare time, Dantley coaches basketball to aspiring players in Silver Spring, Maryland.\n\nHis son Cameron Dantley was the starting quarterback for the Syracuse Orange during the 2008 season.\n\nSince 2013 Dantley has been working part-time as a crossing guard for Maryland's Montgomery County Public Schools. He has said that he likes both the job and the fact that it provides health benefits.\n\nDantley also works as a referee for high school and receational league games in the DC area.\n\n\n"}

The core book was first printed in 1970 as From Bindu to Ojas, while the title of the 1971 publication comes from a statement his guide, Bhagavan Das, made during Ram Dass's journeys in India. The cover features a mandala incorporating the title, a chair, radial lines, and the word \"Remember\" repeated four times.\n\nThe book is divided into four sections:\n\nThe first section is a short autobiography, describing Alpert's successes as a psychologist, his research with Timothy Leary into psychedelics at Harvard, and his subsequent anxiety when this research did not resolve his spiritual questions. He then describes his first journey to India and his initiation into a Guru-chela relationship with Neem Karoli Baba, and spiritual renaming as \"Baba Ram Dass\", or \"servant of god\". Ram Dass closes the first section of the book with this passage:\n\nThe second section, the largest, is a free-form collection of metaphysical, spiritual, and religious aphorisms, accompanied by illustrations.\n\nThe third section is a manual for starting on a yogic or spiritual path, and includes various techniques for yoga, pranayama, and meditation, as well as quotations from respected teachers of many religions and spiritual traditions.\n\nThe last section, entitled \"Painted Cakes Do Not Satisfy Hunger\" (a Zen commentary on liturgy), contains a list of recommended books on religion, spirituality, and consciousness. The book lists are divided into \"Books to hang out with\", \"Books to visit with now & then\", and \"Books it's useful to have met\".\n\nThe book has remained in print since its initial publication in 1971, and has sold over two million copies. The work was originally distributed in pamphlet form by the Lama Foundation, then published as a book in 1971. Its original title was From Bindu to Ojas, with illustrations by Lama community residents. In 1971, when \"Be Here Now\" was first published by the Lama Foundation in New Mexico, some preliminary copies were sent to India. That original edition underwent several revisions as noted later by Ram Dass in \"Be Love Now\" (2010): \"When it was read to Maharaj-ji, he told me to change some of the parts about Baba Hari Dass, who had been my sadhana tutor...\" Those changes, introduced after \"Hari Dass was no longer involved in the intense physical work and management of the Nainital temples\", were presented without a critical revision.\n\nIn 1977, the Lama Foundation gave the copyright and half the proceeds from the book to the Hanuman Foundation in support of its spiritual and humanitarian projects.\n\nThe book is currently published by Three Rivers Press, an imprint of Random House.\n\nA french version was published in 1975 (Editions Robert Dumas), and is available on the web since 1997.\n\n\"Be Here Now\" is one of the first guides for those not born Hindu to becoming a yogi. For its influence on the hippie movement and subsequent spiritual movements it has been described as a \"countercultural bible\" and \"seminal\" to the era. In addition to introducing its title phrase into common use, \"Be Here Now\" has influenced numerous other writers and yoga practitioners, including Steve Jobs, Wayne Dyer, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti.\n\nThe first section of the book inspired the lyrics to George Harrison's song \"Be Here Now\", written in 1971 and released on his 1973 album \"Living in the Material World\".\n\nRam Dass wrote two sequels to \"Be Here Now\". The first was \"Still Here: Embracing Aging, Changing, and Dying\" (2000), and the second was \"Be Love Now: The Path of the Heart\" (2011).\n"}

Battle mode (the standard \"Bomberman\" game), is joined by tennis, golf and baseball games. At the center of all this is the \"Living\" mode, a character building feature in which the player can design a Bomberman for use in any of the battle modes.\n\nBattle Mode is the centerpiece of this and all other \"Bomberman\" games. This mode is essentially the standard \"Bomberman\" formula; in the game, players navigate grid-based mazes, planting bombs in an attempt to hit other players (while avoided being hit by a bomb themselves). There are several different variations of Battle Mode, although they all center around the standard \"Bomberman\" gameplay.\n\n\nBaseball has two modes: a single-match mode (exhibition) and a pennant race in which the player takes part in a league match of thirty games against five CPU teams. Aiming is automatic, causing most of the gameplay to revolve around well-timed button presses (baserunning is also automatic; fielding can even be set to be automatic).\n\nGolf can either be played in exhibition mode or in a tournament mode, with a total of eighteen holes available. Like Mario Golf, shots are handled with a timer bar at the bottom of the screen. A vertical bar moves along the horizontal one; a button press stops the bar, determining the power of the shot. The bar then moves in the opposite direction, eventually passing a stationary bar. A second button press stops the moving bar again; the closer it is to the stationary bar, the more accurate (i.e. straight) the shot will be.\n\nTennis has doubles and singles modes on clay, hard and grass courts.

The \"club of nine\" was an informal group of law firms that comprised Allen & Overy, Clifford Chance, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Herbert Smith, Linklaters, Lovells, Norton Rose, Slaughter and May and Stephenson Harwood. The members of the \"club of nine\" had an informal \"no-poaching\" agreement and the firm's senior partners would meet. \n\nIn 1996, Stephenson Harwood was asked to leave the ‘club of nine’ due to its stagnant performance. The \"club of nine\" was disbanded in 2000.\n\nThe Magic Circle, contrary to the \"club of nine\", is no informal grouping of law firms. Initially, the Magic Circle's membership was described by commentators as comprising the UK firms with strong corporate practices or international work. At the time, these firms were Allen & Overy, Clifford Chance, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Linklaters, and Slaughter and May. Generally, the Magic Circle firms have among the highest earnings per-partner and earnings per-lawyer of UK-headquartered law firms.\n\nIn 2004, Slaughter and May's then senior partner, Tim Clark, said: \"It's a funny concept. I don't know where the term came from or who founded it. It's mainly something that comes up when we talk to journalists or they talk to us. We don't describe ourselves as a Magic Circle firm in any of our marketing material.\" Linklaters' then head of corporate, David Cheyne, said: \"City law firms years ago used to provide information to each other so they could keep in touch with what was going on, but that ended yonks ago... It seems to be a term to describe the leading City firms and there is some truth in it.\" Then corporate partner at Herbert Smith Freehills and former investment banker Henry Raine said: \"The phrase was coined by a legal magazine and referred to firms which were very strong in corporate or international work. At the time, Herbert Smith was languishing in the corporate stakes, and so was consigned to the outer darkness.\"\n\nIn 2013, \"The Lawyer\" argued that Clifford Chance and Slaughter & May should no longer form part of the Magic Circle. It argued that Clifford Chance’s profitability does not match the other Magic Circle firms, and Slaughter & May operates a different (UK-focused) model and its revenue is less than half of the other Magic Circle firms.\n\nAs of 2017\"The Lawyer\" magazine no longer considers Slaughter and May to form part of the Magic Circle due to its lower revenues and UK domestic focus. In 2017, \"The Lawyer\" magazine stated that \"Slaughters fits the silver circle bill in every respect. London-centric, sky-high PEP, top-tier work, an aura of prestige: Slaughter and May is far more like Macfarlanes than the Magic Circle quartet it is commonly lumped in with. To put it in the same category as Allen & Overy, Clifford Chance, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Linklaters would be inaccurate, and to say it is in a class of its own is frankly showing the firm too much deference.\" Other commentators still consider Slaughter and May to be a member of the Magic Circle.\n\nAmong the large firms not included in the term are Herbert Smith, Lovells, Norton Rose and Stephenson Harwood, which mostly confine their international efforts to English-speaking countries. \nAlso, at the time the term was coined, Herbert Smith's corporate practice was focused on privatisation work, which had dried up. Arguably, for this reason, it was not included in the initial Magic Circle. Smaller firms such as Herbert Smith have been seen as more progressive than other older UK law firms, especially in hiring practices conducive to women employees, and have made progress since the global financial crisis when over-leveraged Magic Circle firms were threatened with real fears of insolvency.\n\nTop U.S. white-shoe law firms, such as Sullivan & Cromwell and Cravath, Swaine & Moore, do not franchise out legal offices in the same way, and their international satellite offices service clients for US law only.\n\nThe Silver Circle is an informal term for perceived elite corporate law firms headquartered in the United Kingdom that are the main competitors for the Magic Circle in the United Kingdom. The term was coined by \"The Lawyer\" magazine in 2005 in response to the pre-existing term, Magic Circle. These firms have a lower turnover than the members of the Magic Circle, but consistently have an average profits per equity partner (PEP) and average revenue per lawyer (RPL) far above the UK average (and, in some instances, higher than members of the Magic Circle). Contrary to what the term Silver Circle may suggest, there is no Golden Circle.\n\nUK law firms, including Magic Circle law firms, have experienced increased competition from US law firms both domestically (from US law firms with a UK presence) and internationally.\n\nIn 2013, \"The Lawyer\" argued that the term Magic Circle would lose its relevance, becoming \"outmoded\": \"It will remain an easy shorthand to denote the UK-heritage firms with the biggest revenues, the most international work and which consistently outperform the rest of the [UK] market on profitability.\" It was argued that by 2023 global law firms will rather be split between the Global Elite law firms, International Business law firms and Super Boutique law firms.\n\nThe Global Elite law firms comprise Allen & Overy, Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, Clifford Chance, Davis Polk & Wardwell, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Latham & Watkins, Linklaters, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, Sullivan & Cromwell, Kirkland & Ellis and Weil, Gotshal & Manges.\n\nThe International Business law firms comprise Ashurst, Norton Rose Fulbright, Hogan Lovells, DLA Piper, Jones Day, Baker & McKenzie, White & Case, Herbert Smith Freehills, King & Wood Mallesons and Sidley Austin.\n\nThe Super Boutique law firms comprise Cravath, Swaine & Moore, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, Slaughter and May, Debevoise & Plimpton and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.\n\nIn 2014, it was reported that Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer wished to discard its Magic Circle designation in the US in favour of being part of the Global Elite. Similarly, in 2014, Linklaters’ then managing partner, Simon Davies, said \"The Magic Circle isn’t what it used to be in the context of the US market or any market. I don’t think it’s going to gain power or momentum and I don’t think it’s a strengthening brand in itself.\" and \"At the end of the day we see ourselves as one of the leading global law firms, not one of the leading Magic Circle firms\".\n\nThe following barristers' chambers in the United Kingdom are occasionally, by analogy, described by commentators as the Bar's Magic Circle:\n\n\nIn August 2018, research from The Lawyer, however, showed that South Square Chambers received more instructions from the Magic Circle law firms than any other chamber. Barristers from it worked on 64 matters for the Magic Circle law firms since 2015.\n\n\n"}

The first democratic bloc that consisted of smaller parties was formed during the election. The \"Democratic Bloc\" included the People's Movement of Ukraine (\"Rukh\"), Helsinki Watch Committee of Ukraine, Green World Association, and other organizations. It managed to obtained 111 seats out of 442 in Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament). The democratic deputies formed the \"Narodna Rada\" group, which consisted of around 90 to 125 members and was the opposition to the conservative-communist \"group of 239\" in the parliament (\"for the sovereign Soviet Ukraine\"). Ihor Yukhnovskyi became the leader of the group. The considered lack of parliamentary seats for the \"Democratic Bloc\" became one of the causes of the October 1990 \"Revolution on Granite\". The first of Ukraine's large-scale radical protest campaigns of Ukraine centered on Maidan Nezalezhnosti (the other ones being the 2001 \"Ukraine without Kuchma\", the 2004 Orange Revolution, and the 2013–14 Euromaidan).\n\nDuring the next parliamentary election of 1994 the above-mentioned parties didn't cooperate as \"Democratic Bloc\" but rather went their separate ways. Eventually, by the end of the 2000s, the People's Movement of Ukraine became part of the Our Ukraine block. Helsinki Watch Committee of Ukraine ceased to exist. Its 1990s offspring, Ukrainian Republican Party merged with Ukrainian People's Party and became part of Our Ukraine. The Green World Association transformed itself into the Party of Greens of Ukraine, but that party hasn't won any seats in the Ukrainian Parliament since the 1998 parliamentary election.\n\nAfter the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election only People's Movement of Ukraine was represented in Verkhovna Rada. \nIn the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election this party participated in 3 constituencies; but its candidates lost in all of them and thus the party won no parliamentary seats.\n"}

Remington manufactured approximately 65,000 Model 51 pistols in .32 ACP and .380 ACP calibers from 1918 to 1927, though small numbers were assembled into the mid-1930s.\n\nJohn Pedersen designed or was instrumental in the design of many firearms for the Remington Arms Company. He had worked in concert with John Browning to design the Remington Model 17 which served as the basis for the Remington Model 31, Ithaca 37, Browning BPS, and Mossberg 500. He designed the Pedersen device that converted the M1903 Springfield into an autoloading pistol-caliber longarm. Pedersen later worked for the US Army and provided competition to John Garand building an autoloading rifle to fire a full-power rifle cartridge. His design used innovative wax lubricated cases and a toggle-bolt system much like that of the Luger pistol but eventually lost out to the M1 Garand.\n\nMade in .380 ACP and later in .32 ACP caliber, it was marketed as a pocket pistol. While the European market embraced small-caliber pocket pistols, the American market favored revolvers at the time. The complex trigger and safety mechanisms made the handgun more expensive than the Browning-designed competition, and the Model 51 was not much smaller. Furthermore, Remington was a company known for their long arms; their handguns had previously been limited to revolvers forced to play second fiddle to Colt in terms of sales. The Remington Model 51 also had only limited commercial success as it was priced around US$15.75 (in 1920, California minimum wage US$0.33 per hour). This was in spite of the marketing claims of it be \"self aiming\" due to the advanced approach to ergonomics used by Pedersen. If competing with cheaper single-action blowback autoloaders made sales difficult, the stock market crash made sales nearly impossible. Impending autoloading pocket pistols like the Walther PPK ended any chance of further success by Remington pistols. For the smaller calibers it was made in, blowback operated pistols were cheaper, only slightly heavier, and did not produce excessive recoil.\n\nAn advantage of Pedersen's design is that it allows for a lighter slide than a straight blowback operated pistol, and hence an overall lighter short arm, with the hesitation lock contributing to less felt recoil for this intuitive pointing pistol. General George S. Patton owned a Remington 51 and was thought to favor the pistol. Despite critical praise, no government or private agency is known to have adopted the Model 51 for use. An anchor proof marking on some pistols has led to the mistaken belief that they were US Navy pistols bolstered by the fact that the Navy did indeed recommend a .45-caliber version for adoption. Some examples are seen today with inventory numbers, however their provenance is not well known and understood to have numbered one, two or six. Subsequently, the Navy ran extensive tests on the M53 and concluded it was “...a simple, rugged and entirely dependable weapon, which should be suitable in every respect for a service pistol.”\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, inventor Ross Rudd designed and prototyped a .45 ACP caliber pistol based on the Pedersen layout but with an inclined surface in place of the locking surface. This served to delay the opening of the breech rather than locking it. The pistol was planned for manufacture but was never produced. The Italian firm Benelli produced limited numbers of B76, B80, and B82 pistols similar to the Rudd pistol; however, they utilized an inertial locking system\n\nThe Remington R51 is a redesigned Model 51 initially released in February 2014 before supply and recall issues by Remington, believed to be built by Para Ordnance, a company recently acquired by the Freedom Group.\n\nDespite its shortcomings, the design was recommended for adoption by the Navy Board during the First World War as the scaled-up .45 caliber Remington Model 53. Testing of the prototype against production M1911 showed the Remington design to be more reliable. Remington demanded a large advance payment to tool up for the gun, but negotiations were cut short by America's entrance into World War I. Available factories were tooled to produce the M1911 so investment in ramping-up production for another pistol did not make sense. Production of the 1911 kept pace with wartime demands and Remington itself was eventually contracted to produce the Colt weapon.\n\nBecause of a lower bore axis, lighter slide, and locked breech, the Remington 53 boasted much less felt recoil than the M1911. This fact was attested to by noted firearms expert Julian Hatcher. The Remington pistol was also more accurate, lighter, and had fewer moving parts than the 1911. Despite its advantages over the M1911, there was too little civilian market to support a large-bore pistol at that time, a military contract was now unlikely, and the M1911 already had a firm foothold. Remington abandoned the larger pistol and focused on the Model 51.\n\nIn 2014, Remington announced a redesigned Model 51 in 9mm Luger caliber called the R51.\n\n\n\n"}

It is believed that he built the great Mosque City of Bagerhat, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nHe is also known by the name \"Ulugh Khan\", and this suggests that he is of Turkic origin, possibly an Uzbek. Initially a noble under the Tughlaq Sultanate, Khan Jahan seems to have migrated to Bengal following the Capture of Delhi by the Timurid Empire led by Timur in 1398.\n\nAfter migrating to Bengal, Khan and his companions were welcomed by 12 Muslim saints to Champanagar (which was renamed Barobazar after the 12 saints). Khan stayed here for a number of years. 126 dighis are attributed to him and mosques built during his stay include Gorar, Golakata, Jor-Bangla, Pir Pukur, Satgachia, Monohar, Sukkur Mollick, Nungola, Pathagar and Adina. Damdama and the dighis of Galakata and Saudagar can also be found here. Khan completed the road built by Ghazi, which originally went from Barobazar to Jessore, extending it to Bagerhat.\n\nKhan was able to acquire a forest area in the Sundarbans as a jagir from Sultan Mahmud Shah of Bengal. The official title \"Khan-i-Azam\" was given to him displaying that he was an officer and local ruler under the Bengal Sultanate. Khan worked with his two deputies, Burhan Bura Khan and his son, Fateh Khan, to clear up a lot of dense forest area in order to set up human settlements and rice cultivation. He and his group of sappers embanked the land along streams to keep saltwater out and dug hundreds of tanks (known as dighis) for water storage. This area he governed came to be known as Khalifatabad and stretched up north to Naldi in Lohagara. He built numerous mosques here such as Singair, Bibi Begeni, Chunakhola, Ranabijoypur, Nine Dome, Zinda Pir and Reza Khuda as well as the Ghora dighi. Most notably, he built the Sixty Dome Mosque which was one of the largest during this period.\n\nKhan also travelled to Jessore where he established the township of Murali-Qasba. It was situated near a number of little towns such as Bogchar and he built a road to connect them all (now known as Khanjalir Jangal). He left behind two disciples here, Gharib Shah and Beram Shah; to carry on preaching Islam as he continued. The tombs of Beram Shah, Burhan Khan and Fateh Khan, dighis of Sarbabad, Mirzapur, Lashkar and mosques of Mathbari, Maguraghona, Masjidkur, Gharib Shah, Shubharara Mosque can be found in Murali-Qasba. In Phultala, he established the Poyogram-Qasba. Two mosques that were built here were as large as the Sixty Dome Mosque but are now ruins. The roads in this town had a \"rectangular cheeseboard pattern\". One of the roads still in use is Khanjali Road and one of the mosques which isn't in ruins here is Dakshin Dihi mosque. One of Khan's houses and Shahabatir Dighi can also be found in Poyogram.\n\nHe founded numerous caravanserais, constructing hundreds of mosques as well as madrasas, roads and bridges. There is a single-domed mosque attached to his tomb. The Sixty Dome Mosque was also used as his central assembly hall and as a madrasa. He excavated a large number of dighis, especially when constructing mosques to enable wudhu facilities. The most notable dighis are the Khanjali Dighi, excavated in 1450 and located near his tomb, and Ghoradighi, measuring to the west of the Sixty Dome Mosque. He is said to have built a highway from Bagerhat to Chittagong, a long road from Samantasena to Badhkhali, and a road running from Shuvabara to Daulatpur in Khulna.\n\nHis role as administrator of Khalifatabad did not stop him from also preaching the religion of Islam to the local people which he focused on even more after retiring. His humanitarian work such as establishment of dighis for clean water was a number of reasons why the local Hindus were attracted to Islam. He led a simple life and had a number of disciples; most notably, Shaykh Muhammad Tahir (better known as Pir Ali), who is buried near him. It is unknown how, but Khan died on 25 October 1459 (27 Dhul Hijjah 863 AH).\n\nAfter his death, he was buried in a mazar near one of his mosques and dighis. The dighi contains crocodiles which are considered to be descended from the two crocodiles which Khan rode on. The great-grandmother of Haji Faqir Humayun Kabir, a guardian of the shrine, is said to have fought with them. Hundreds of visitors visit the shrine everyday, and also pet the resident crocodiles.\n\nKhan Jahan introduced a new architectural style in his buildings, which is named after him. The Khan Jahan style architecture is seen throughout the modern-day Khulna Division. The Khan Jahan Ali Airport is a proposed airport in Mongla to be named after him.\n\nOne of the Bangladesh Navy's auxiliary ships is named after him as \"BNS Khan Jahan Ali\". The ship was made by Ananda Shipyard & Slipways Limited and handed to the Bangladesh Navy on 6 November 2014. The 80-metre-long tanker can carry 2,400 tons of diesel and 120 tons of aviation fuel. It can go 24.5 km per hour with full load and can refuel two war ships simultaneously. The ship was commissioned on 6 September 2015. Previously, there was an oil tanker with the name \"BNS Khan Jahan Ali\". This was an Ex-Soho Maru (T1056) made by Setoda's Naikai Shipbuilding in 1963. It was sold after 1983 and commissioned on 14 July 1987 as a naval tanker. It was decommissioned after 28 years on 5 September 2015.\n\n\n"}

It was established in 1484 and as part of the Royal Household operates under the authority of the Crown. The Lord Lyon King of Arms holds a similar role within Scotland. A separate private body called the Flag Institute, financed by its own membership, also maintains a registry of United Kingdom flags that it styles 'the UK Flag Registry', though this has no official status under UK law.\n\nCertain classes of flag enjoy a special status within English planning law and can be flown without needing the planning permission normally required for advertisements. These include any country’s national flag, civil ensign or civil air ensign; the flag of the Commonwealth, the European Union, the United Nations or any other international organisation of which the United Kingdom is a member; a flag of any island, county, district, borough, burgh, parish, city, town or village within the United Kingdom; the flag of the Black Country, East Anglia, Wessex, any Part of Lincolnshire, any Riding of Yorkshire or any historic county within the United Kingdom; the flag of St David; the flag of St Patrick; the flag of any administrative area within any country outside the United Kingdom; any flag of Her Majesty’s Forces; and the Armed Forces Day flag.\nNational and subnational flags of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe flags of England and of Scotland are ancient war flags which became by usage the national flags of the Kingdom of England (which included Wales) and of the Kingdom of Scotland respectively and continued in use until the Act of Union 1707. Thereafter they were as \"de facto\" flags of those parts of the United Kingdom. The flag of Wales was formalised in 1959, but has ancient origins, the dragon was used as a battle-flag by countless Welsh rulers, the current flag being a redesign of the flag carried by Henry Tudor. The Flag of Northern Ireland is controversial. The coat of arms of the Government of Northern Ireland, a red cross on a white field, defaced with a Red Hand of Ulster within a six pointed star topped with a crown, became used as a local flag, though the end of the province's Government in 1973 ended its official status. This flag has continued to be the internationally recognisable de facto flag of Northern Ireland through its use by international sporting organisations (for example FIFA, UEFA, and the Commonwealth Games) to represent Northern Ireland, though locally it has the allegiance mainly of the Unionist community. The St Patrick's Saltire is also sometimes used by the UK government in London to represent Northern Ireland when a discrete Northern Ireland flag is required.\n\nIn 1999, the maritime flags of the British Overseas Territories were updated at the request of the Ministry of Defence. The white discs were removed from the field of the flags and each respective coat of arms was increased in size for ease of identification. As the MoD only had authority over sea flags, the Governments of the Overseas Territories were free to continue using the flags with white discs on land. The Overseas Territories' governments did switch to the updated flags over a staggered period of time, however some old-style flags with white discs may still be seen. Such flags have generally been adopted by Order in Council. Civil (Red Ensign) flags are under the control of the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Transport and are split into two categories: Category 1 is to register ships of unlimited tonnage and type. category 2 is to register commercial ships and yachts of up to 150 gross registered tons.\n\nPrior to 1999, all Governors' flags had smaller discs and the outer green garland without the gold ring. Therefore, the dates given do not reflect this minor, consistent change.\n\nFlags are often used to represent counties, cities and towns. Where these are based on a council's banner of arms they are technically for the use of the council, but they are often used to represent the wider area, including by official bodies such as the Department for Communities and Local Government.

{"id": "2307653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2307653", "title": "Esteban Manuel de Villegas", "text": "Esteban Manuel de Villegas\n\nEsteban Manuel de Villegas (Matute, La Rioja, 5 February 1589Nájera, La Rioja, 3 September 1669) was a 17th-century Spanish poet.\n\nVillegas studied grammar in Madrid and later enrolled at the University of Salamanca on 20 November 1610. There he obtained a degree in Law, though he never entered the legal profession. Though he was the royal treasurer in Nájera, he did not obtain any of the positions he wanted. Despite coming from a wealthy family, he spent his entire life in financial difficulties due to his numerous children and his continuous involvement in litigation. At the age of 36, he married Doña Antonia de Leyva Villodas, twenty years younger than him. In 1659 he was tried by the Inquisition which accused him of believing himself in possession of the absolute truth. He was jailed after responding that he knew more about thorny questions than the Church Fathers. He wrote satires against religious communities. Many of these writings are lost, as they were confiscated by the Inquisition. The Inquisition condemned him to four years of exile in Santa María Ribarredonda, but he was pardoned after a year. It seems probable that the rest of the sentence was remitted, for the report of the local inquisition lays stress on Villegas’s simple piety, on the extravagance of his attire, and on the eccentricity of his general conduct and conversation, so marked as to suggest a mental disturbance. He died at the age of 80 in Nájera.\n\nVillegas wrote a lyrical book that was very original for its time, \"Las Eróticas\" (Nájera, 1618, later widely reprinted, especially by Sancha in Madrid, 1774 and 1797), the cover of which bore under a rising sun the motto \"Me surgente, quid istae?\". This book earned him more than a few enemies because of his excessive pride, and he tried to suppress the emblem of the copies that he could; Lope de la Vega referred to this in his \"Laurels for Apollo\", but did not mention Villegas by name.\n\nThe book is divided into two parts; the first is written in heptasyllables, imitation of Anacreontic style and matter; the second is in endecasyllables, being historical in content. It contained very delicate poems in short meters, which he managed with special skill. This book of poems contains very free translations of Horace, elegies, idylls, epigrams and some sonnets. It handles the syllables quantitatively and it uses Sapphic, Adonic, and Anacreontic meters rather than the forms then current in Spanish literature. This is why his poetry is purely formal, strictly following form and with many circumlocutions. For this reason he set a strong precedent for Neoclassicism in the 18th century. His longer works have a strong flavour of culterano, as in his \"Ode to Philip III\". His intention to introduce quantitative meter only appears in his introduction to the \"adónicos sáficos\", since these lend themselves well to a hendecasyllabic form:\n\nHe also, fortunately, tried to adapt Spanish poetry to the Anacreontic style; he was imitated during the 18th century in this lyric subgenre, specially cultivated in Villegas' style, particularly by Juan Meléndez Valdés and José Iglesias de la Casa. Also his gracefully rhythmic pastoral \"Cantilenas\" was much imitated. At an advanced age, he translated Boethius' \"De consolatione Philosophiae\" and, wiser after his encounter with the Inquisition, left in Latin the part corresponding to free will. He wrote in addition two volumes to \"Disertaciones\" in which he commented on the classics which had been lost. This work was lost into the hands of Father Martín Sarmiento shortly thereafter. In addition he composed \"Discurso contra las comedias\" and \"Antiteatro\", which were never published.\n\n"}

It is a strap that runs forward from the bottom of the girth or surcingle, and forks. The forks continue to a ring on either side of the bridle or halter, at the base of the crownpiece. Running through those rings, the forks follow the cheekpieces to the bit. They may attach to the bit or pass through the bit rings and attach to themselves below the horse's neck.\n\nA chambon prevents the horse from raising its head beyond a fixed point. Raising the head causes the length of the chambon along the cheekpieces to shorten and thus puts reciprocal pressure on the horse's mouth and on the horse's poll. Horses generally dislike pressure behind the poll and learn to release the pressure by lowering their head, and when in motion, this encourages the horse to relax its back and bring its hindquarters further under its body, thus encouraging collection.\nThe chambon has the opposite function to an overcheck or bearing rein, which is used to raise the horse's head.\n\nThe chambon is used mostly in training horses via lungeing. The chambon was originally intended for lungeing and free schooling. It is advanced equipment for use by knowledgeable trainers. A chambon is not a way to quickly fix the head set of a horse; its purpose is to help develop the correct muscles. Chambons help a horse to develop the muscles of their back and topline. It applies pressure to the poll and mouth of the horse when he raises his head, releasing when the horse stretches long and low, down toward the ground. When a horse is lunged correctly, and the chambon is correctly adjusted, the horse stretches down and raises his back.\n\nBefore using a chambon, the horse is taught to give correctly while worked in hand. If not, the horse may not understand that it needs to lower its head in response to the pressure, and thus may panic when it feels the upward and ungiving pressure on the bit, and possibly rear. The advantage of the chambon is that it only comes into effect when the horse raises its head, so the horse has some control on its action. It generally works very well on horses in adjusting their head position. However, it has no direct effect on the hindquarters, so the handler must use a lungeing whip or other method to encourage impulsion in the horse.\n\nIf a horse is not lunged properly, he may begin to go on his forehand. Chambons can also cause sore neck muscles if overused.\n"}
{"id": "2307667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2307667", "title": "Lugaru", "text": "Lugaru\n\nLugaru: The Rabbit's Foot is the first commercial video game created by Indie game developer Wolfire Games. It is a cross-platform, open-source 3D action game. The player character is an anthropomorphic rabbit utilizing a wide variety of combat techniques to battle wolves and hostile rabbits. The name \"Lugaru\" is a phonetic spelling of \"loup-garou\", which is French for werewolf. It was well reviewed and was fairly well received among the shareware community, especially among Mac users.\n\nThe story takes place on the island of Lugaru, an unknown number of years after the fall of the human race; all of the characters are anthropomorphic animals. The story focuses on Turner, a mildly famous retired warrior rabbit who lives in a small village with his family and friends.\n\nUnbeknownst to Turner, a pack of wolves from a nearby island had killed and eaten all of the prey that lived there, and came to Lugaru to find more food. Not wanting to make the same mistakes as before, they plan to conserve their food supply by enslaving and farming the citizens of the local rabbit kingdom rather than hunting their new food supply to extinction. Afraid for his life, the rabbit king Hickory agreed to this takeover, provided that the wolves do not harm him. To secure the deal, he sent Jack, one of his most loyal servants, to kill the local raiders, since they would be the only real resistance the wolves would encounter. To do this, Jack decides to trick Turner into killing the raiders. Jack manipulates Skipper, a close friend of Turner's, convincing him to leave Turner's village undefended as part of a ploy to spur him into killing the raiders. Jack tells him nothing about the wolves, and assures him that no one will actually be harmed during the attack. He then pays the raiders to kill everyone in the village, including Skipper.\n\nJack's plan is largely successful. The raiders lure Turner away from the village and attack while he is absent, murdering his entire family and nearly all of his friends. Jack stages his own death during the attack. Turner makes it his mission to avenge the deaths of his loved ones, and begins to systematically kill all of the raiders, unwittingly opening the way for the wolves to conquer Lugaru. However, everything did not go exactly to plan: the raiders decided to keep Skipper alive for a ransom. Once most of the raiders have been killed, Turner encounters Skipper in one of the raiders' camps. Skipper tells Turner how Jack manipulated him, which prompts Turner to return to his village and confirm the location of Jack's corpse. After seeing that Jack's body is missing, Turner correctly surmises that Jack had gone to the Rocky Hall (the location of the Rabbit Kingdom's monarchy) after betraying him, and decides to pursue him there.\n\nAfter Turner reaches the Rocky Hall, one of the guards there informs Turner that Jack has set a bounty on him. However, most of the guards see Turner as a hero and refuse to attack him, instead pretending that they haven't seen him. Grateful, Turner leaves the Hall and goes north to continue pursuing Jack. On the way, Turner encounters and is forced to fight a desperate guard in need of money who had tracked him after he left the hall, a wolf, and five rabbit soldiers Jack had sent to kill him. Despite this, Turner finally tracks Jack down, finding him not far from where the soldiers were defeated. Seeing no reason to continue the charade, Jack explains the entire situation to Turner before being killed by him in single combat.\n\nHaving learned the terrible truth, Turner confronts king Hickory about the wolves. Hickory orders his guards to kill Turner, but in light of Hickory's dealings with the wolves, they refuse. With the full support of the king's guard, Turner proceeds to take power in a bloodless coup. He then vows to the other rabbits that he will meet with the Alpha wolf, and if need be, kill him. Hickory, determined to kill Turner and reclaim the throne, uses his connections with the wolf pack to send three wolf assassins to try and kill him before he reaches the Alpha. However, Turner manages to defeat the assassins and later finds Hickory hiding in the mountains with two of his most loyal guards. Not knowing the fate of the assassins, Hickory threatens Turner with them, and is shocked when Turner reveals he was able to kill them. Turner confronts Hickory over his cowardice in not even trying to fight against the wolf conquest, angering him, and prompting him to attack. Turner kills Hickory in the ensuing battle and takes his sword.\n\nBolstered by his recent victories, and growing misanthropic due to his recent struggles, Turner finally reaches the wolves' den and kills every wolf there, including the mothers and children. Ash, the Alpha wolf, arrives later. Ash warns that if Turner defeats him it would mean ruin for the rabbits as they would overpopulate, causing famine and civil war without the wolves enforcing the natural order. Turner counters this by stating that if he does not kill the wolves, they would just lose control and kill all the rabbits again, starving themselves out, and that a death by his hand would be more honorable. In the ensuing battle, Turner manages to successfully overpower Ash and defeat him. After this he returns to the Rocky Hall, where he is offered the chance to become king, since no one would dare challenge the power of a rabbit who killed an entire wolf pack. Turner declines, feeling that he is not up to governing, and decides to wander the island trying to find a new purpose for his life.\n\nMost of Lugaru's gameplay consists of Hand-to-hand combat with a heavy emphasis on Martial arts, and in many cases the combat incorporates knives, swords, and bo staves. The player can perform disarms, reversals, and counter-reversals. Despite the focus on melee combat, the player is not limited to outright attacking their enemies, since Lugaru has pronounced elements of stealth gameplay, and actively rewards players for defeating foes while remaining undetected.\n\nLugaru's combat controls are entirely original. There are only three context-sensitive action buttons: one \"attack button\", a \"jump button\", and a more general \"crouch-reverse\" button. This setup puts special emphasis on the timing and positioning of attacks to maximize their effectiveness, rather than memorizing complicated key combinations to do more damage.\n\nThere is no HUD, so the player must rely entirely on visual cues to determine Turner's current state of health; most notably the character's posture, visible injuries on his body, darkness and blurred vision. The player must also keep note of various environmental factors such as sounds, the direction of the wind and the presence of blood on their weapons; since wolf enemies have a strong sense of smell, are less approachable from downwind, and can also smell blood from both open wounds and soiled weaponry. Similarly, rabbits have great hearing and are sensitive to noises generated by rustled bushes.\n\nThe game can be played in campaign mode, which includes mission-specific objectives and the storyline, as well as a \"challenge\" mode, which involves the player progressing through a series of fourteen maps with the goal of clearing them of all hostile creatures. There is also an interactive tutorial.\n\n\"Lugaru\" was made almost solely by David Rosen, including the game engine, models, animations and story. It was one of the first independently produced video games to employ ragdoll physics. It uses a unique combat system that bases attacks and counters on timing and context rather than different key combinations. \nOriginally released January 28, 2005 for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux\nfollowed that year as target platforms.\n\nIn 2010, after the success the first Humble Indie Bundle Lugaru was part of, Wolfire released the source code of Ryan C. Gordon's code branch of \"Lugaru\" under the GNU General Public License on May 11, 2010.\n\nThe source code availability allowed the game to be ported to additional platforms such as AmigaOS 4 or OpenPandora. In November 2016 David Rosen relicensed all assets under the open content CC BY-SA 3.0 Creative Commons license which makes Lugaru a fully free video game. In the beginning of 2017 the HD version followed. Development continues on a GitLab repository by the community.\n\nTim Soret would later improve the game's graphical textures, and Wolfire currently sells this updated version as \"Lugaru HD\".\n\nDavid Rosen has announced that \"Overgrowth\" would be the sequel to \"Lugaru\". A remake of \"Lugaru\" was included in \"Overgrowth\".\n\nLugaru also has a number of mods made by the many fans of the game. Players can choose to download the \"Lugaru Downloader\" (discontinued, seeks a new developer) which gives them a list of all the fan-made mods so far. \"Lugaru Downloader\" also extracts and backs up the files and installs the mod automatically, rather than forcing users to back up files themselves and risk errors and glitches. The Wolfire forums contain a link and information, and the website comes with the download link and info.\nAdvanced modding, namely modifying skeletons to work custom animated characters into the game, 3D dodel customization, animation editing and map editing have been made possible by reverse-engineering the file formats and writing Python plugins for Blender. An overview of all modification resources, done modifications and how-to documentation can be found in this thread on the Wolfire forums.\n\nGame designer Jacob Driscoll reviewed Lugaru in his web series, \"Game Design by Jacob Driscoll\".\n\nIan Beck of InsideMacGames gave Lugaru an 8.25 out of 10 after an in-depth, three-page review. He criticized the game's linear story as a minor drawback and the ragdoll physics as being \"mildly ridiculous\". However, he praised the game's graphics as being \"very good\" (with consideration given to the game's low budget), and he also praised the motion blur, slow motion effects, and the attention the developer gave to environmental details like the blood effects on both the terrain and the character models. He especially praised the context-based combat system.\n\nStephen Kelly of Blue Mage Reviews praised Lugaru's \"advanced, innovative combat system\" and noted that the game's \"strategic depth prolongs replay value\", while mentioning that the game can be frustratingly difficult at times, and has poor visuals. He also said, \"It's a testament to the core gameplay that it continues to entertain well after the story mode is completed, and its blend of unusual ideas should be remembered and learned from in the future.\" \n\nAs of June 2013, GameRankings lists only a single review for the game: David Vizcaino of Gamers Daily News, who gave \"Lugaru\" an 8.3, stated the game is \"well worth trying out if you're looking for something fun/challenging to play\".\n\nGamingOnLinux reviewer Hamish Paul Wilson gave the game 8/10, stating that it is \"an impressive feat, if anything over ambitious and yet still executed with a fair amount of competence and skill. Though it has some rough edges, it offers an experience unparalleled by any other title, be it the console fighting games that established the genre or its counterparts on the desktop computer.\"\n\n\n"}

His residences were served at New York's Bellevue Hospital and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. He then went to Europe for further study.\n\nHaving an interest in aviation, he became Flight Surgeon with the rank of First Lieutenant in Army Medical Corps Reserve. He began studying the problems of high-altitude flight, and in 1938 the Aeromedical Field Laboratory located at Wright Field requested him to develop an oxygen-mask for use in high-altitude aircraft.\n\nIt was in 1940 that he first met Jacqueline Cochran, a female pilot who held three women's speed records. The two would form a lifelong friendship. With Cochran's influence, Lovelace developed a research program focusing on women's capabilities for spaceflight. Lovelace believed women could be highly suitable for space because they were smaller and lighter for small space vehicles. Lovelace used his privately owned clinic to test twenty-five women. The women who were chosen all had to fulfill Lovelace's requirements: be under the age of 35, in good health, hold a second class medical certificate, have a bachelor's degree, hold and FAA commercial pilot rating or better, and have over 2,000 hours of flying time. Prior to beginning testing, Lovelace's women had to undergo thorough examinations which included numerous x-rays and four hour eye exams. The women's bodies were physically tested by using special stationary bikes to test their respiration and ice water was shot into their ears to induce vertigo to see how quickly the women could recover. Twelve of Lovelace's women were chosen but testing ended suddenly due to the United States Navy no longer granting them a testing facility.\n\nDuring World War II he served in the United States Air Force. He personally performed experiments in escape and the use of the parachute at high-altitude. On 24 June 1943 he bailed out of an aircraft flying at 40,200 feet. After the parachute opened he was knocked unconscious, and he suffered frostbite when his gloves were ripped off. For this test he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n\nHis wife Mary had two sons, but both died of poliomyelitis in 1946. The couple also had three daughters. In 1947 they moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, and he joined his uncle at Lovelace Clinic, with whom he established the Lovelace Medical Foundation, currently known as the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, in Albuquerque. He became the chairman of the Board of Governors. His first hire was Clayton Sam White for director of research. Lovelace used this clinic to promote the development of medical aerospace technology.\n\nIn 1958 he was appointed the chairman of the NASA Special Advisory Committee on Life Science. As head of NASA's Life Sciences, he would then play a key role in the selection of the astronauts chosen for Project Mercury. In 1959 he also began examinations to determine the physical suitability of women candidates for the astronaut training program. In 1964 he was appointed NASA’s Director of Space Medicine.\n\nIn 1965 Lovelace and his wife were flying in a private plane near Aspen, Colorado. Their pilot became disoriented and flew into a blind canyon. All three people were killed in the crash.\n\n"}

Admiral Nimitz recommended that a ship be named in honor of the surgeon for his dedicated service, after Capt.

She sailed from the Admiralties on 1 October 1944 and arrived at Port Purvis on Florida Island, in the Solomons, on 4 October 1944. Following intensive training with PT boats at Tulagi, she sailed on 27 October 1944 for the Russell Islands and rendezvoused with a convoy of landing craft bound for New Georgia Island. Departing on 29 October 1944, the group proceeded to Cape Torokina, Bougainville, where the landing craft debarked troops. \"Gendreau\" escorted the landing craft back to the Russells on 1 November 1944, and returned to Port Purvis the next day.\n\nFrom 17 February through 20 February 1945, \"Gendreau\" was in dry dock, being repaired by its seamen and members of the repair ship . Lieutenant Martin Victor became captain of \"Gendreau\" at this time.\n\nIn March 1945, following three months of escort and ASW duty shuttling between islands of the South Pacific, \"Gendreau\" rehearsed for the coming Okinawa invasion after which she escorted landing craft to the Russell Islands and Port Purvis, arriving at Port Purvis on 7 March 1945, and returning to the Russells four days later. Underway from the Russells on 12 March 1945, she called at Ulithi on 21 March 1945 for final staging and sortied four days later with a task force for the Ryukyus.\n\nOn L-Day, 1 April 1945, \"Gendreau\" was off the southeast coast of Okinawa protecting amphibious ships. Before dawn a Japanese plane attacked the DE but was shot down and crashed a few yards to starboard. A few hours later she closed the invasion beaches and delivered the landing craft to their assigned positions well in advance of the final bombardment and initial landings. The next day she was in the destroyer screen when another enemy plane attacked her at dawn, but with the aid of other ships she managed to shoot it down. On 3 April 1945, a plane strafed her and then, on its second pass, tried to crash her, but \"Gendreau\"s gunfire blew it out of the air and the plane crashed 25 yards (23 m) away. On 5 April 1945 she joined a hunter-killer group.\n\nOn 6 April 1945, a torpedo bomber aimed a torpedo at the DE, but it exploded upon hitting the water. \"Gendreau\" shot down the bomber astern. The following day she destroyed another attacking plane. On 12 April 1945, without warning, a torpedo bomber roared in and released a torpedo which passed just under the bow and exploded some distance beyond. On 16 April 1945, two enemy planes homed in on her, but two American fighters swooped in from behind and shot down the attackers.\n\n\"Gendreau\" departed Okinawa on 22 April 1945 with a convoy, touching at Saipan five days later and returning to Okinawa on 2 May 1945. She departed the next day for Ulithi, arriving there on 7 May 1945. Underway again on 23 May 1945 with a mixed convoy, she called at Okinawa on 29 May 1945 and escorted convoys in these waters. On 10 June 1945, while supporting the American troops who were wresting the island from Japan, \"Gendreau\" was hit by shellfire from a hidden 150 mm (5.9 in) gun. She lost power and began taking water, but outstanding damage control had her under control in 15 minutes and nearly restored her to normal within two hours. Two men were killed and two others wounded.\n\nAfter repairs at Kerama Retto and later at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, she joined Vice Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf's Task Force on 13 July 1945, for training and minesweeping in the East China Sea. On 26 July 1945 she rescued a friendly fighter pilot who had ditched at sea, picking him up only 32 minutes after the crash. At the end of the month a bad typhoon caused her to roll nearly 60° and buckled steel plating. On 31 July 1945 she escorted damaged battleship to Guam and returned to Okinawa on 12 September 1945, where four days later, another typhoon parted her port anchor chain. She departed on 22 September 1945 to act as courier ship during the Allied occupation of the Japanese homeland.\n\nThus, after a short but distinguished war career, \"Gendreau\" stood out of Tokyo Bay on 4 November 1945 bound home via Pearl Harbor, arriving at Portland, Oregon on 22 November 1945. Around this time, the departing captain of \"Gendreau\", Lieutenant Commander Martin Victor, gave the following farewell address to the crew:\n\nIn February 1946 she proceeded to San Diego for training exercises and then departed the following month on a Far Eastern cruise. \"Gendreau\" arrived at Shanghai, China, on 14 April 1946, and sailed to Hulutato, Manchuria, and then to Tsingtao and Chinwangtao, China. Further patrols brought her to Okinawa and Shanghai again May to June, and on 1 July 1946 she headed for California, arriving at San Diego on 19 July 1946. After training and repairs, she cast off on her last Far Eastern cruise, calling at Pearl Harbor and Guam en route to Japan.\n\n\"Gendreau\" arrived in Japan on 19 March 1947. In the spring and summer of 1947, \"Gendreau\" stood patrol duty off the Korean coast, calling at Yokosuka, Japan on 21 May 1947, and thence returning to station. On 1 September 1947, she sailed from Japan for Pearl Harbor and San Diego, putting in at the latter port 19 September 1947.\n\n\"Gendreau\" decommissioned on 13 March 1948 and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Diego. \"Gendreau\" was stricken on 1 December 1972. \"Gendreau\" was sold on 11 September 1973 and broken up for scrap.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2307679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2307679", "title": "Comprehensive examination", "text": "Comprehensive examination\n\nIn higher education, a comprehensive examination (or comprehensive exam or exams), often abbreviated as \"comps\", is a specific type of examination that must be completed by graduate students in some disciplines and courses of study, and also by undergraduate students in some institutions and departments. Unlike final examinations, comprehensive examinations are not linked to any particular course, but rather test knowledge across one or more general fields of study.\n\nGraduate-level comprehensive examinations are sometimes also known as preliminary examinations (\"prelims\"), general examinations (\"generals\"), qualifying examinations (\"quals\"), or as major field examinations. If these examinations are held orally, they may be known colloquially as \"orals\". The comps most commonly come after the student has completed required coursework and before starting on the dissertation; successful passage of the comps is sometimes required for a student to be considered a \"Ph.D. candidate\".\n\nThe form and general requirements for the comprehensive exam vary according to the faculty or department, degree sought, university, and country, but typically tests knowledge of the student's subject area and two or more related areas, and may be used to determine a candidate's eligibility to continue his or her course of study. At the graduate level, the purpose of the comprehensive exam is to ensure the student is familiar enough with her area of research to make original contributions.\n\nThere is no standard definition for what such exams entail, with some universities having almost no exam, whilst at other universities the process is quite rigorous. The exams thus take a number of forms, including an informal meeting of just a few hours, a critical review of one's academic portfolio, the submission of an academic paper which may take several hours or months to write, or a series of proctored exams taking anywhere from a few hours to two days.\n\nThe comprehensive examination system is used primarily in US and Canadian higher education, but it has also been adopted by some programs in other countries such as Pakistan and India. Other countries use alternative forms of evaluating Ph.D. candidates: in the United Kingdom, for example, students typically must first enroll in an M.Phil. program and are then admitted to doctoral study only upon successfully defending their research proposal.\n\nSome colleges or universities in the United States require undergraduate students to pass comprehensive examinations in order to receive their degree. These include Wabash College, Kenyon College, Bethany College, The Catholic University of America, The University of Iowa, Maryville College, Occidental College, Reed College, The University of the South, Eckerd College, Millsaps College, Earlham College, Hanover College, Rosemont College, St. Anselm College, Shimer College, Whitman College, and University of Dallas.\n\nMany degree programs require students to pass comprehensive examinations within colleges or universities that don't otherwise require them. The same is true for many schools and colleges within larger universities. These include Texas A&M-Commerce Honors College, The University of Virginia's Politics Honors Program, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Mass Communications program.\n\nIn some terminal non-thesis Master's programs, successful completion of a comprehensive examination, conducted online or through the university's testing center, is a requirement for graduation during a student's last semester of coursework. A prominent example of such is the Major Field Test for Master of Business Administration (MFT-MBA) which has been used in the MBA programs of over 300 U.S. universities.\n\nA comprehensive exam may also be required for a master's degree earned on the way to the completion of a doctoral program. In such cases, students might take an oral exam and/or field exam in order to both earn a Master's in their field and advance to the status of doctoral or PhD candidate. Typically, one exam will question the student on theory while the other will show competency or expertise in their chosen subfield (or major field) within their program. This also allows students enrolled in the program who do not wish to continue to the completion of a doctoral degree to leave early and in good standing with a Master's.\n\nIn most doctoral programs, students must take a series of written cumulative examinations on the subject of their study in the first year or two of the PhD program. These cumulative exams are often given on a pass/fail basis and a graduate student who seeks to continue in the PhD program must pass a minimum number of these cumulative exams. After this minimum number of cumulative exams is passed, this degree requirement is considered to be met, and the PhD student no longer takes these exams but continues work on other PhD requirements. In some fields, such as history, the student must pass the comprehensive examinations before submitting a dissertation proposal.\n\nTypically, comprehensive exams consist of either a written or an oral exam, but some programs require both. In others, a written exam is taken, and depending on the grade, the student may or may not have to continue with an oral exam. In some fields, the level of detailed knowledge required is relatively limited, while in others such as economics the level of detail is similar to a final exam.\n\nComprehensive examinations are often based on a reading list agreed upon by the student and his or her committee, which is staffed by the primary supervisor and several advisors, normally professors at the university, but not necessarily in the same faculty. They also frequently have a standardized component for all students in the discipline, or may be entirely standardized. This reading list may comprise dozens or hundreds of books and other works.\n\nFor some social science and many humanities disciplines, graduate students might not have studied the discipline at the undergraduate level. These examinations will be the first set of comprehensive exams, and be based either on graduate coursework or on specific preparatory reading (sometimes up to a year's work in reading).\n\nPreparing for comprehensive exams is normally both stressful and time consuming. Passing them allows the student to stay, begin doctoral research, and rise to the status of a doctoral candidate. Failing usually results in the student leaving the program or re-taking the test after some time has passed. A second failure normally guarantees dismissal from the graduate program, though progress on previous attempts may convince the student's program to grant a third, final attempt. Some schools have an intermediate category, passing at the master's level, which does not permit the student to continue doctoral study, but does allow the student to leave with a master's degree despite not having completed a thesis.\n\nIn some U.S. graduate programs, particularly in the natural sciences, the majority of students do not have master's degrees when they begin doctoral work, and the successful students will earn doctorates without getting master's degrees on the way. In these programs, a student who does not pass \"comps\" or \"prelims\" on the second attempt will generally be allowed to earn a terminal master's degree but is not permitted to become a candidate for a doctoral degree. At some institutions, students who pass the exam and are formally accepted as PhD candidates are technically entitled to a Master of Arts or Master of Sciences degree, but submitting an application is required, so no master's degree will be awarded unless the student specifically requests it. Other institutions issue an All But Dissertation certificate after a student has passed the comprehensive exams.\n\nPhD students at some Canadian universities must complete their comprehensive exams by the end of their second year; those who fail to pass with a sufficiently high mark may retake the examination usually only once. Failure to pass a second time will normally result in expulsion from the program. Students who pass are distinguished with the title \"PhD candidate.\"\n\n\n"}

Sinister (meaning \"left\" in Latin) is merely a directional indicator, and does not carry the negative connotations of the word in modern English.\n\nIt is commonly believed to be an indicator of an illegitimate birth in the family line, and is used in this way in literary contexts. However, in medieval England, there was no single mark of difference for bastardy. Until the late fourteenth century, the same marks of cadency were used for both illegitimate and legitimate children, but thereafter the arms of some bastards took the form of a plain or party field with their fathers' arms on a figure such as a bend, fess, chief, chevron or quarter.\n\nThe baton sinister can be seen in the arms of the Duke of Grafton, descended from an illegitimate son of King Charles II of England. Today, the College of Arms in England uses a bordure wavy to mark an armiger as illegitimate. The Court of the Lord Lyon in Scotland uses a bordure compony to denote the same.\n\n\n"}

Cedillo was a Democratic member of both the California State Assembly and the California State Senate.\n\nCedillo was a candidate for California's 32nd congressional district seat, vacated by Hilda Solis. The California's 32nd Congressional District Special Election, 2009 was held on May 19, 2009. Cedillo lost the primary to Board of Equalization Member Judy Chu.\n\nCedillo grew up in the Boyle Heights area of Los Angeles. His father worked as a mechanic at American Can in Vernon and was a member of the United Steelworkers of America. His mother was a garment worker at Sears and Times-Mirror Press.\n\nCedillo attended Lorena Street and Euclid Avenue Elementary, Stevenson Junior High and Roosevelt High. He graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with a bachelor's degree in Sociology in 1977, and he received a Juris Doctor degree from the Peoples College of Law, in Los Angeles, in 1983.\n\nHe was a close friend of Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, whom he met at Roosevelt High. The friends both became active in Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA) and attended the People's College of Law.\n\nCedillo worked for the Service Employees International Union (SEIU Local 660), Los Angeles County's largest union, where he served as general manager from 1990 to 1996. In his years as general manager, he protected youth programs and played a critical role in securing $364 million in federal assistance to ensure that the Los Angeles County Health Care system remained afloat. President Bill Clinton stated that his decision to provide funding \"was reached after critical consultations with SEIU\". Cedillo was fired from the union after losing a power struggle with Local 660's board of directors.\n\nCedillo won a special election on January 13, 1998, to the California State Assembly's 46th district, and served there until 2002.\n\nIn 2002, he was elected to the State Senate. Cedillo attempted to have driver's licenses to illegal aliens reinstated, and was the author of the California DREAM Act. He also worked on increasing and expanding access to health care, developing regional solutions to combat homelessness, and encouraging economic development in his Downtown Los Angeles district. Gil Cedillo is a member of the Council of La Raza.\n\nCedillo was re-elected in 2006, defeating South Pasadena City Councilman Mike Ten, a Republican. Cedillo received 71,199 votes, Ten received 18,581 votes, and Murray Levy, a Libertarian candidate, received 3,469 votes. He was Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Immigration and the Economy and was a member of the Senate standing committees on Appropriations, Health, Public Safety, Rules, and Transportation and Housing.\n\nOn September 28, 2006, Cedillo was arrested along with approximately 200 others for blocking Century Blvd. in front of LAX, during a protest supporting the right for employees to unionize at the LAX hotels.\n\nOn January 8, 2009, Cedillo announced his candidacy for the 32nd Congressional District seat, which was vacated by Congresswoman Hilda Solis. Congresswoman Solis accepted an appointment from President-elect Barack Obama as United States Labor Secretary. In the blanket primary (now superseded by Proposition 14's \"top two\" primary system), Cedillo competed against Judy Chu, a former Monterey Park assemblywoman and vice-chairman of the State Board of Equalization; the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, voted to endorse Chu. Cedillo received a majority of other major endorsements, including eight members of California's Congressional Delegation, LA Sheriff Lee Baca, Los Angeles Police Chief Bill Bratton, and more than 100 current and former public officials, including Senator Gloria Romero, Senator Ron Calderon, and Assemblymember Ed Chavez, who all dropped out of the race and endorsed Cedillo. Chu defeated Cedillo with 15,338 votes (31.9%) to Cedillo's 11,244 votes (23.4%).\n\nFollowing his failed bid for U.S. Congress, Cedillo was elected to the California State Assembly's 45th District seat in 2010. The seat had been vacated by Kevin de León, who won the 22nd State Senate seat. Cedillo served as chairman of California's Latino Congressional Caucus. In 2010, Cedillo authored California's SRC 113, a resolution for a statewide boycott of the State of Arizona, following Arizona's passage of SB 1070, an illegal immigration enforcement bill. \n\nCedillo tried nine times, since 1998, to get bills passed in the California State Legislature that would allow people unlawfully residing in California to obtain driver's licenses. In 2001 and 2002 Governor Gray Davis vetoed two of Cedillo's bills that would have permitted this. In the midst of the 2003 recall election, Davis backed and signed SB 60 (2003), Cedillo's driver's license bill. After Davis was recalled and Arnold Schwarzenegger became governor, the state legislature, with Schwarzenegger's support, repealed the new law before it went into effect. Senator Cedillo agreed to repeal the law he wrote under the agreement with the Governor to work on a bipartisan bill. In 2004, Schwarzenegger vetoed AB 2895, an identical bill to Senator Cedillo's SB 1160 that stalled in the legislature, saying that it did not meet his security concerns. The governor wanted a \"marked license\" that was identifiable. AB 2895 was introduced to the legislature by one of Cedillo's closest allies, Speaker of the Assembly Fabian Núñez.\n\nIn 2005, Cedillo authored SB 60, another driver's license bill. He made new modifications to the proposal, specifying that illegal immigrants would not be able to use the driver's license for purposes of identification for boarding airplanes, opening bank accounts, registering to vote, or other rights of U.S. citizens. Again, Schwarzenegger refused to sign the bill, on the grounds that it did not satisfy his security concerns. After Schwarzenegger vetoed the bill, Cedillo threatened to file a lawsuit against the Governor because of his belief that the Department of Motor Vehicles misinterpreted SB 976 (1993), which first prohibited the issuance of driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. Illegal immigrants in the process of becoming legal residents, and citizens considered to have authorized presence but not legal permanent residency status, are known as people residing under the color of the law.\n\nIn 2006 and 2009 Cedillo again brought the proposal before the California legislature, failing both times. On October 3, 2013, California Governor Brown signed AB 60, allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses. Cedillo remarked, ″It took a long time, but now it’s here. Today signifies much more than just another bill being signed by our governor. Today is history in the making because it is the day we return justice back to the people.″\n\nIn 2011, Cedillo authored a pair of assembly bills to allow illegal aliens to obtain financial aid for universities through both private and public sources. The assembly bills, known as AB 130 and AB 131 for private and public financial aid respectively, became law. The measures have drawn both praise and criticism from various organizations. Proponents claim that the bill would finally narrow the gap in education for a US citizen and an illegal alien, thus providing equality and greater opportunity. Critics have said that the measure is a waste of taxpayer money for an already cash-strapped California with tuition costs increasing and many students unable to continue their education.\n\nIn August 2011, at nearly the same time AB 131 was passed by the Senate, AB 353 also passed. The bill allows drivers without a license who are stopped at checkpoints to have a licensed driver retrieve the vehicle and thereby avoid having the vehicle impounded for 30 days.\n\nIn 2010, Cedillo attempted to reverse a pay cut approved by voters in 2009 for all 120 lawmakers (Prop. 25). Cedillo filed a claim in December 2010 with the California Victim Compensation and Government Claims Board seeking back pay for what he maintains were illegal pay and benefit cuts. His complaint stemmed from the 2009 decision by the California Citizens Compensation Commission to slash legislators' pay and benefits by 18 percent. The cut reduced their remuneration from US$116,208 to $95,291.\n\nBecause of term limits, Cedillo could not run for reelection to the California State Legislature in 2012. He ran for a seat on the Los Angeles City Council representing Council District 1 and was elected in 2013.\n\nIn December 2013, Cedillo authored a Los Angeles City Council resolution urging President Obama to halt most deportations and to expand the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to \"all immigrant families who are not engaged in criminal activity.\"\n\nIn May 2017 Cedillo authored a motion requiring companies to disclose whether they were\ninvolved with the construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall promised by President Donald Trump before being able to work with the City of Los Angeles.\n\nGil Cedillo ran for reelection in Council District 1 in Los Angeles. His opponents were Jesse Rosas, Giovany Hernandez, and Joe Bray-Ali. In the primary election Cedillo won 49.4 percent, missing the threshold to avoid a runoff election. Challenger Joe Bray-Ali drew 38 percent, more than any other challenger, and was able to face Cedillo in the runoff. Cedillo defeated Bray-Ali in the runoff with over 70 % of the voters in Council District 1 on May 16, 2017.\n\n"}

{"id": "2307710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2307710", "title": "Azure Dreams", "text": "Azure Dreams\n\nAzure Dreams, released in Japan as , is a PlayStation video game developed by Konami and was originally released in Japan on November 13, 1997. A stripped-down version was later released on the Game Boy Color. A semi-sequel, \"\", was released on the Nintendo DS in 2005.\n\nAzure Dreams is set in the desert town of Monsbaiya. The town prospers because of a Monster Tower located over it. A skilled monster tamer named Guy disappears in the tower and is never seen again. His son, Koh, enters the tower when he turns 15 and meets a familiar named Kewne - a monster that can speak to humans. Kewne and Koh embark on a quest to reach the top of the Monster Tower and find the truth about Guy's fate.\n\nThe game offers a lot of choice in respect to how individual players wish to play. The main focus of the game is entering the tower and destroying its denizens, collecting treasure and monster eggs to hatch into \"familiars\". Each monster has hidden spells, unique traits, and abilities. But an interesting side mission is the improvement of the town of Monsbaiya. With his acquired riches, Koh can finance the building of a theatre, hospital, racing track, casino, bowling alley, and gym. Some buildings allow the appearance of specific love interests (such as the Hospital making way for Cherrl to appear and the library making Mia available), while others offer minigames and the ability to acquire currency at a faster rate. Koh can also improve the furnishings and decorate his home.\n\nThe player is also given the option of pursuing romantic ambitions in Koh's life. There are seven characters that he may develop a relationship with, from tomboy Nico to stuck-up, selfish Selfi. There are a few differences that exist between the Japanese and American versions of the game, in the Japanese version it had voiced dialogue for every character, the title screen was dramatically changed, the intro movie was narrated and the angel/cherub was more animated, larger and looked much different. The monster book graphics were also redone. The Japanese version has a seahorse like selector with more colorful elemental bars, for example the water one has vines growing on it. The layout of the picture and text was different also with the Japanese version having the monster text off to the right and the stats under the picture. The buttons were also completely changed from the Japanese version, and not just an O, X swap. This relationship-building aspect of the game is absent from the Game Boy Color version.\n\nEvery time Koh enters the Tower, he returns to level one; however, any familiars hatched outside the Tower retain their current level. As such, progression through the higher levels of the Tower relies on strengthening the familiars or equipment. Strengthening weapons and shields can be an uphill battle, because the items that add a +1 to their attack or defense are often far outnumbered by Rust Traps, one of the many varieties of randomly generated traps that only become visible once activated. One remedy to this is to use types of equipment that do not rust. Furthermore, once in the Tower, there are only three ways of exiting it: If Koh \"dies\" within the Tower, he returns to town but loses all equipment he carried; a familiar can be sacrificed using a specific item found within the Tower, called an Oleem, allowing Koh to escape and keep all of his other equipment; and a Wind Crystal can be found in the Tower that allows escape at any time.\n\nAnother unique point of \"Azure Dreams\" is the random map generator: every time Koh enters the Monster Tower, the levels are randomly generated so as to make every monster-hunting experience different.\n\nIn many ways, \"Azure Dreams\" is a graphical roguelike. Activity within the main dungeon is turn-based, with one move or attack corresponding to a turn (e.g. when the player takes a step, so do opposing monsters). Randomly generated dungeons and treasures are also features shared with the genre.\n\nThe game's soundtrack was composed by Hiroshi Tamawari.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \"A randomly generated dungeon map might conceivably add to the replay value, but as it is, \"Azure Dreams\" will not exactly have many gamers coming back for long.\"\n\nThe game received \"average\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.\n"}

He is perhaps best known as the character \"Lonely\" in the TV thriller series \"Callan\", starring Edward Woodward; and that of shop steward Harry in the Yorkshire Television sitcom \"The Gaffer\".\n\nBorn Russell Ellis in Glasgow, Hunter's childhood was spent with his maternal grandparents in Lanarkshire, until returning to his unemployed father and cleaner mother when he was 12. He went from school to an apprenticeship in a Clydebank shipyard. During this time, he did some amateur acting for the Young Communist League before turning professional in 1946.\n\nUnder the stage name Russell Hunter, he acted at Perth Rep and at the Glasgow Unity Theatre also performing in the very first Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1947 in \"The Plough and the Stars\" by Seán O'Casey, was a comedian in summer variety shows and toured with a one-man show.\n\nHunter worked in repertory theatre and Scottish variety before making his film debut in \"Lilli Marlene\" (1950). In the same year, he appeared in the film \"The Gorbals Story\", which featured members of the Glasgow Unity Theatre including Archie Duncan and Roddy McMillan. The film also featured Hunter's first wife, Marjorie Thomson. He followed these by playing a pilot in the Battle of Britain drama \"Angels One Five\" in 1951.\n\nAs an actor, he joined Peter Hall's Royal Shakespeare Company, working with Peggy Ashcroft and Dame Edith Evans.\n\nHis most memorable role was the timid, smelly petty criminal, Lonely, unlikely accomplice to a clinical spy-cum-assassin, in the downbeat 1967 television spy series \"Callan\". Reportedly, he said of his identification with Lonely that \"I take more baths than I might have playing other parts. When Lonely was in the public eye I used only the very best toilet water and a hell of a lot of aftershave.\"\n\nAfter playing Costard in a BBC television production of \"Love's Labour's Lost\" (1965), Hunter was cast as Lonely in ITV's \"Armchair Theatre\" production \"A Magnum for Schneider\" in 1967, which introduced the secret agent Callan to the screen. Four series followed (1967, 1969–72). Hunter and Edward Woodward reprised their roles in both a 1974 feature film of the same name and, seven years later, in the television film \"Wet Job\", by which time Lonely had gone straight, got married and was running a plumbing company called Fresh and Fragrant. The title plays on \"wet job\" the euphemism for murder or assassination.\n\nDuring his years with \"Callan\", Hunter acted in the Hammer horror film \"Taste the Blood of Dracula\" (1970) and took the roles of Crumbles, Dr Fogg and Dr Makepeace in an ITV production of \"Sweeney Todd\" (1970), He also appeared in the British comedy film \"Up Pompeii\" (1971) as the Jailer.\n\nHe had two notable appearances in one-man plays performed on BBC Scotland in the early 1970s: \"Cocky\", where he played Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn, which ended with his speech to the jury defending Helen McDougal, Burke's wife, in the Burke and Hare case, and \"Jock\", where he played an archetypal Scottish soldier guarding a military museum. In 1974 he played Ted, a simple-minded but kind-hearted man in a two-part story in \"Rooms (TV Series)\", two-part dramas concerning the various drifters who rent rooms in a lodging house. In 1975 he played a Scottish painter in the BBC's adaptation of the \"Lord Peter Wimsey\" story \"The Five Red Herrings\". In 1979, at the artist's request, he opened the Edinburgh Festival Exhibition of the Glasgow artist Stewart Bowman Johnson held at the Netherbow Gallery. \nHunter's other TV credits include \"The Sweeney\", \"Ace of Wands\" (as the evil magician Mr Stabs, a role he reprised in an episode of the anthology series \"Shadows\"), \"Doctor Who: Robots of Death\", \"Farrington of the F.O.\", \"The Bill\", \"A Touch of Frost\", \"Taggart\", sitcoms \"Rule Britannia\" (1975) as the Scotsman Jock McGregor and shop steward in \"The Gaffer\" (1981–83), and his last ever TV appearance, in the BBC drama \"Born and Bred\". In his last years he reprised his \"Doctor Who\" role for a series of audio plays released on CD, \"Kaldor City\". He also appeared in an episode of \"Mind Your Language\" as a minor character in the episode \"I Belong To Glasgow\". He also appeared in the TV sitcom Lovejoy as a Scottish submariner in the episode \"Angel Trousers\".\n\nHe also appeared as different characters in the pilot and series of the BBC sitcom \"Rab C. Nesbitt\".\n\nIn 1949, Hunter married Marjorie Thomson and had two daughters. In 1970, he married actress Caroline Blakiston after they both appeared in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" at the Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park. They had a son and a daughter. His third marriage, in 1991, was to fellow performer Una McLean.\n\nAlthough in the advanced stages of cancer, Hunter's last theatrical stint was in the Reginald Rose play \"12 Angry Men\" at the same, if inconceivably expanded, Edinburgh Festival Fringe, with which he had remained inextricably linked.\n\nDespite being ill, Hunter received positive reviews for his appearances in the feature film \"American Cousins\" late in 2003 and as a priest in the film \"Skagerrak\". In November, \"American Cousins\", Hunter's last movie role, received the Special Jury Prize at the Savannah Film Festival in the United States, ending a career spanning six decades.\n\nRussell Hunter died aged 79 at Edinburgh's Western General Hospital of lung cancer.\n"}

When he was nine years of age, Ullathorne's family relocated to Scarborough, where he began his schooling. He is a descendant of Saint Thomas More through his great-grandmother, Mary More.\n\nAt 12 he was taken from school and placed in his father's office to learn the management of accounts. The intention was to send him to school again, but Ullathorne wished to go to sea, and at the age of 15, with his parents' permission, he made the first of several voyages to the Baltic Sea and Mediterranean. While attending Mass in Memel he experienced something in the nature of a conversion, and on his return asked the mate if he had any religious books. Ullathorne was given a translation of Marsollier's \"Life of St Jane Frances de Chantal\", which deepened his religious devotion. At the end of this voyage he returned home. In February 1823, aged 16, he was sent to Downside, near Bath, where he was mentored by John Bede Polding, afterwards the first Archbishop of Sydney, who influenced him greatly.\n\nIn 1823 Ullathorne entered the monastery of Downside Abbey, taking the vows in 1825, taking the additional name \"Bernard\", after Bernard of Clairvaux. He was ordained priest in 1831, and in 1832 went to New South Wales as vicar-general to Bishop William Placid Morris (1794–1872), whose jurisdiction extended over the Australian missions. It was mainly Ullathorne who caused Pope Gregory XVI to establish the hierarchy in Australia. In 1836, Bede Polding sent Ullathorne back to Britain, to recruit more Benedictines. While in England, he visited Ireland, where he met Mary Aikenhead. He returned to Australia in 1838 with five Sisters of Charity. Ullathorne returned to in England in 1841, suffering what Judith F Champ says would in modern terminology be described as \"burnout\". He then took charge of the Roman Catholic mission at Coventry, where he recovered his health and spirits.\n\nUllathorne had turned down bishoprics in Hobart, Adelaide, and Perth as he did not wish to return to Australia, but in 1847 he was consecrated bishop as Vicar Apostolic of the Western District, in succession to Bishop C.M. Baggs (1806–1845), but was transferred to the Central District in the following year. Ullathorne helped found St Osburg's Church in Coventry.\n\nOn the re-establishment of the hierarchy in England and Wales, he became the first Roman Catholic Bishop of the Diocese of Birmingham. During his nearly four decades of tenure at the see 67 new churches, 32 convents and nearly 200 mission schools were built. In 1888 he retired and received from Pope Leo XIII the honorary title of Archbishop of Cabasa. He died at Oscott College and his monument is in the crypt of St. Chad's Cathedral, Birmingham, although he was buried in the sanctuary of the Church of St Dominic and the Immaculate Conception at Stone, Staffordshire. There is Bishop Ullathorne RC School in Coventry which is named after him.\n\nOf Ullathorne's theological and philosophical works the best known are \"The Endowments of Man\" (1882); \"The Groundwork of the Christian Virtues\" (1883); \"Christian Patience\" (1886). For an account of his life see his \"Autobiography\", edited by A. T. Drane (London).\n\n"}

Formerly named for Benjamin Franklin, the mall houses 200 stores, a movie theatre, two food courts, and seven theme restaurants and was visited by an estimated 18 million people in 2006.\n\nOpened in 1989, Franklin Mills was the second built and formerly owned by the Mills Corporation and is now managed by the Simon Property Group. Along with King of Prussia, Simon has control of Pennsylvania's two largest malls.\n\nOn September 16, 2014, Simon Property Group renamed the mall from Franklin Mills to Philadelphia Mills.\n\nThe Philadelphia Mills site was formerly home to Liberty Bell Park Racetrack. It is located approximately one mile west of Interstate 95, at the intersection of Woodhaven Road (Pennsylvania State Route 63) and Knights Road.\n\nPhiladelphia Mills mall is designed in the shape of a thunderbolt in commemoration of Benjamin Franklin's kite-and-key experiment. The mall's former logo from when it was called Franklin Mills included a red kite with a lightning bolt on the right side and the string ending on the letter \"A\" of \"FRANKLIN\". The mall is separated by its four Neighborhoods: Red, Blue, Yellow, and Green, and has six main entries including its neighborhood color entries, plus Aqua at the Grand Court and the Orange entry in its Green Neighborhood near the former Steve & Barry's. There are also entries at either side of the AMC 14 theater for moviegoers after mall hours.\n\nThe mall is the first Mills mall to have two food courts. \"Cafe Court\" is at Red Neighborhood 1 and is anchored by GAP. \"Cafe Freedom\" is a larger food court at Green Neighborhood 4, and as of early 2016, \"Cafe Freedom\" was renamed as \"Dining Pavilion\" and has undergone renovations. The mall once had graphics, usually hanging from the ceiling, but in the later years, they were removed. The mall also previously had two video courts, one was removed in the 2000s, and the other one which was removed in August 2014. From the mall's opening until 2012, an animatronic likeness of Benjamin Franklin's face hung from the ceiling at the Grand Court between Neighborhoods Blue & Yellow, which would announce the time hourly. Almost all main mall entries have a graphic at its entry. Throughout the mall, there are several sets of projection TVs hanging from the ceiling known as \"Mills TV\", showing video loops of music videos and advertisements, as of the early 2010s however, They were eventually replaced by double-faced Daktronics LED boards.\n\nThe mall consists primarily of factory outlet stores. As of November 2011, the surviving major anchor tenants included Marshalls and Burlington. When the mall first opened in 1989 the original anchors were JCPenney; Sears; Ports of the World, Reading China and Glass, and Phar-Mor. Over time, the Ports was re-branded as Boscov's, and was later replaced by Steve & Barry's. Reading China & Glass closed and its building was split between Marshalls and OfficeMax. Sears left the mall for the first time and was replaced by General Cinema, itself acquired by AMC Theatres. OfficeMax later left the mall, and Sears returned taking the OfficeMax space. Original stores remaining in the mall include Bed, Bath and Beyond & Modell's, which have been joined by Forever 21, Last Call, H&M, & Off 5th, among others. As of November 29, 2011, 3 of the mall's 5 main anchors were vacant. On December 15, 2011, it was announced that JCPenney would be returning to the mall as a department store, in its original location; the outlet store had been closed as part of a nationwide realignment by the retailer of all its outlet stores. On March 17, 2017, JCPenney announced that its store would be closing as part of a plan to close 138 stores nationwide; the store closed on July 31, 2017.\n\n"}

{"id": "2307762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2307762", "title": "Reverend Harry Powell", "text": "Reverend Harry Powell\n\nReverend Harry Powell is a fictional character in Davis Grubb's 1953 novel \"The Night of the Hunter\". He was portrayed by Robert Mitchum in Charles Laughton's 1955 film adaptation, and by Richard Chamberlain in the 1991 made for TV remake. He was voted 29th on the American Film Institute's top 50 villains of all time list.\n\nPowell is a self-declared itinerant preacher, who is also a con artist, and serial killer. He has the words \"LOVE\" tattooed on the knuckles of one hand and \"HATE\" tattooed on the other, a fact that he explains to his victims by using his hands in a sermon about the eternal struggle between good and evil. He spreads the gospel up and down the Ohio River in the late 1920s and early 1930s, gaining the trust of wealthy widows, marrying them and then killing them for their money. Driven by a fanatical hatred of women and sex, he believes that he is doing God's work, as \"[God's] book is full of killin's.\" He roams the West Virginia and Ohio countryside along the river, leaving a trail of murdered women in his wake, until he is arrested for grand theft auto in Parkersburg and sent to the state prison in Moundsville.\n\nThere he meets Ben Harper, who is sentenced to hang for killing two men while robbing a bank of $10,000. However, despite Powell's wheedling questions as to the money's location, Harper takes the secret to the grave. After Harper's execution, Powell leaves prison and heads downriver to Harper's home in Cresap Landing to find the money. He meets Harper's widow, Willa, and her children, John and Pearl, and ingratiates himself into the family by pretending to have been the prison chaplain and a good friend of Ben's; Willa and Pearl are smitten, but John doesn't trust him. Powell learns that the children know where the money is, and marries Willa to have access to them.\n\nAfter Willa learns the truth about her marriage, Powell kills her and drops her body in the Ohio River. After he threatens to kill John, Pearl reveals the secret: the money is hidden in her doll. The children escape, doll in tow, and ride down the river on their father's old skiff. John and Pearl drift for days until they find a farmhouse near Williamstown run by Rachel Cooper, who takes care of homeless, orphaned, and abandoned children.\n\nHowever, Powell has followed their trail and comes to the house one day claiming to be the children's father. Rachel is not fooled and pulls a gun on him; he leaves, but vows to return later. After nightfall, the desperate preacher charges into the farmhouse only to be shot by Rachel. Yelping in pain, Powell runs into the barn and is arrested the next morning after Rachel calls the state police in Parkersburg. Harry Powell is tried and convicted for multiple murders, including Willa's, and sentenced to death.\n\nAuthor Grubb based Harry Powell on Harry Powers, who lived in Quiet Dell, West Virginia (near Clarksburg), and lured several widows and their children there by way of \"lonely heart\" ads in newspapers. He murdered several of them and was subsequently hanged in 1932 at the state prison in Moundsville.\n\nThe Reverend Powell character has become one of cinema's most popular, influential villains. Mitchum's performance has reaped widespread acclaim; he later said Powell was his favorite role. Stephen King has called Powell one of the greatest villains in fiction.\n\nThe tattoos on Powell's knuckles of the words \"LOVE\" and \"HATE\" have become one of the most iconic images in film history; it has been referenced and parodied in films ranging from \"Do the Right Thing\" and \"Blazing Saddles\" to \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\", as well as television shows such as \"The Simpsons\" and \"Seinfeld\" and songs by groups such as The Clash and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.\n\nThe \"Ren & Stimpy\" character Reverend Jack Cheese, who goes around preaching \"the gospel of meat,\" is based on Powell. His knuckle tattoos say \"PITY\" and \"SELF PITY\". In the episode \"It's a Dog's Life\", meanwhile, Stimpy is shown to have the words \"Love\" and \"Hate\" tattooed on his upper and lower lip. \"Ren & Stimpy\" creator John Kricfalusi has called \"The Night of the Hunter\" his favorite film.\n\nIn the \"Supernatural\" episode \"Form and Void\", protagonist Sam Winchester plays part of Powell's speech on love and hate from \"The Night of the Hunter\" as part of a trap he sets.\n\n"}

She graduated from New York University and published cartoons and humour essays in \"The New Yorker\" before moving to the West Coast, hiring an agent, and finding work in radio and, eventually, television. Her first radio writing credit was in 1943 on \"Pabst Blue Ribbon Time\" with Groucho Marx, the \"Camel Caravan\" with Jimmy Durante and Garry Moore, \"The Drene Show\" with Rudy Vallee, \"Duffy's Tavern\", and \"The Kenny Baker Show\". In 1950, she became one of the staffers hired by legendary comedy writer Goodman Ace (who'd previously hired her for some work on Danny Kaye's short-lived 1940s' radio show) for \"The Big Show\" (1950–52), the ninety-minute weekly program hosted by actress Tallulah Bankhead. Considered one of the last great variety shows of the classic old time radio era, this Sunday night comedy marathon featured some of the biggest entertainers of the era.\n\nShe moved on to television as one of the writers for Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca's groundbreaking \"Your Show of Shows\". Diamond was reputed to have been the inspiration for the Sally Rogers character on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\", which centered on the head writer for a fictitious, mercurial television comedian. While writing for another Caesar vehicle, \"Caesar's Hour\", Diamond earned an Emmy nomination. She also worked for Goodman Ace once again, writing for Perry Como's successful \"Kraft Music Hall\" television series.\n\nDiamond wasn't always taken seriously by her writing peers. Bob Schiller, who had also written for \"Duffy's Tavern\" and \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\", told author Jordan R. Young (for \"The Laugh Crafters\"), \"The jury is still out on whether Selma was a comedy writer. She was really a very interesting character—salty, and she was—exactly what you saw on camera is what she was.\"\n\nIn 1960, she released a comedy album based around her humorous conversational style called \"Selma Diamond Talks...and Talks and Talks and Talks...\" (Carleton LPX 5001, 1960).\n\nIn 1970, she wrote the book \"Nose Jobs for Peace\", published by Prentice-Hall ( )\n\nBy the 1960s and 1970s, Diamond was familiar as a frequent guest on \"The Jack Paar Show\" and \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\", and she made numerous film appearances, including Stanley Kramer's comedy \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" (as the unseen telephone voice of Spencer Tracy's wife, Ginger Culpepper), \"Bang the Drum Slowly\" (as hotel switchboard operator Tootsie), and \"All of Me\" (as Margo). In 1982, she appeared in \"My Favorite Year\" with a memorable small role as wardrobe mistress for \"King Kaiser's Comedy Calvalcade\", a fictional show which clearly echoed the time and venue of her work for Sid Caesar. She was also a semi-regular for four seasons of the Ted Knight comedy series \"Too Close For Comfort\".\n\nFor many years, Diamond resided in a co-op apartment at 60 Sutton Place South in Manhattan until she moved out in the late 1970s. The diminutive Diamond, who was a chain smoker, was one of the original cast of \"Night Court\" until she was stricken with lung cancer and died at age 64 in Los Angeles. She was buried in Hillside Memorial Park in Culver City, Los Angeles County, California. By tragic coincidence, her successor playing the bailiff, Florence Halop, was also lost to lung cancer after her one year in the cast of \"Night Court\".\n\n"}

The company's national support office is located in Williams Landing.\n\nDespite the similar logo, name and type of outlets, Target Australia carries no corporate connection or relation to the US discount retailer, Minneapolis, MN-based Target Corporation.\n\nIn 1926, George Lindsay and Alex McKenzie opened their first store in Geelong selling dress fabrics, bedding and furnishings. Lindsay had begun his retail empire five years earlier, running a store in Ouyen, Victoria, but moved to Geelong to increase the opportunity for growth. The company progressively established stores throughout Victoria, running with a policy of selling quality goods at half the normal rate of profit.\n\nIn 1968, Myer Emporium purchased the chain of 16 stores and renamed the company Lindsay's Target, with an aim to expand the business. With the stores rebranded as Target, it quickly established itself throughout Australia, and within 3 years had stores in Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and New South Wales. In March 1973, \"Lindsay's\" was dropped from the company name when the business was renamed Target Australia Pty Ltd.\n\nBy 1982, Myer was operating 27 stores under the Target brand, but sold 22 of these with 14 going to GJ Coles & Coy Ltd.\n\nIn August 1985, Myer Emporium Ltd and GJ Coles & Coy Ltd merged to become Coles Myer Limited. In 1996, Coles Myer merged the Target and Fosseys brands, and their first speciality store Baby Target was established. Then in 1998, their second speciality store, Target Home opened. Fosseys stores were later renamed Target Country, becoming the third speciality store under the Target name.\n\nIn 2001, Target announced its first ever loss, to the sum of $43m. New senior management was soon put in place, with Target repositioning itself from a store directly competing with Coles Myer stablemate Kmart and Woolworths Limited's Big W, to a more stylish, up-market, but still value-for-money, alternative to speciality stores. Store fittings and layouts were altered to reflect this change. In 2006 Target appointed Launa Inman as managing director, named Telstra Business Women of the Year in 2003, a result of her achievements as an apparel retail buyer for the company. Her position saw Target's $32 million loss at the end of 2000 turn into a $68 million profit 18 months later.\n\nPrior to its November 2007 takeover of Coles Group, Wesfarmers stated in August 2007 that it would consider converting some Kmart stores to the Target brand.\n\nIn May 2009, Target stopped providing free plastic bags for its customers, but in 2013 reversed this decision. In November 2011, Dene Rogers, the former chief executive of North American retailer Sears Canada, replaced Inman as Target's managing director, but by April 2013 Rogers had been replaced by former chief operations director at Coles Stuart Machin.\n\nIn February 2016, Wesfarmers restructured Target and Kmart under a single 'Department Stores' division, headed by Kmart managing director Guy Russo. An accounting scandal that created $21 million in fraudulent profits was reported on 11 April 2016. Although it is not believed CEO Stuart Machin orchestrated or ordered the accounting irregularities, he took the blame for the scandal and departed Target.\n\nIn June 2016 at a Wesfarmers annual strategy briefing Guy Russo announced that Target would be exiting toy sales, pet care and luggage.\n\nTarget announced in April 2016 it would relocate its Geelong head office to Melbourne, resulting in an unspecified number of redundancies. Following the April 2016 announcement, Wesfarmers confirmed in December that Target would relocate to Williams Landing in late 2018.\n\nIn June 2017, Wesfarmers announced that Target and Kmart would be merging some of their back office operations including procurement. Some Target stores would be converted to Kmart stores while other Target and Target Country stores would be closed. As part of the Target to Kmart store conversions, three have taken place, two being in Victoria, at Doncaster East, another at Broadmeadows, and a third in Western Australia at Victoria Park East, all of which were Target's that were converted into Kmart stores.\n\nAs of 2020, Target has 284 stores throughout Australia: 191 Target stores, and 93 Target Country stores. There have been 24 closures, 13 Target stores and 11 Target Country stores, since the announcement of store closures in 2016.\n\nIn May 2020 further store closures and consolidations were announced.\nUp to 1,300 jobs could disappear.\n\nCurrent Store Formats\n\nTarget\n\nTarget department stores are the majority of Target stores located throughout Australia, and stock the full range of Target's products. \n\nTarget Country\n\nFosseys was established in 1926 at George Street, Sydney by Alfred Bristow Fossey and grew to 148 stores throughout Australia, with an annual turnover of $300 million. As part of the acquisition of Grace Bros, which had purchased JB Young's of Queanbeyan who owned Fossey's, Myer and later Coles Myer came to own Fossey's. Coles Myer used the Fosseys brand to unify a range of smaller variety stores trading under a range of other names, including Coles Variety stores, which had been the foundation of GJ Coles & Coy Ltd.\n\nColes Myer merged the operations of Fosseys with Target in 1996, redesigning Fosseys stores to focus on family apparel retailing in rural Australia. It also introduced Fosseys-branded merchandise with attributes of value, convenience and confidence. By 2001, all Fosseys stores located close to Target stores were closed; the remaining Fosseys stores, rebranded Target Country, continue to focus on apparel sales in smaller towns without full-merchandise Target stores. From the mid 1990s onwards there was a rebranding of some Grace Bros stores in regional NSW to Target. This included a large number of stores which had previously been part of the Dubbo based Western Stores. Locations which converted from Grace Bros to Target and then Target Country include Bathurst, Cowra, West Wyalong, Forbes, and Young.\n\nAs of 1 July 2007, employees of Fosseys (Australia) Pty Ltd were transferred to Target Australia Pty Ltd, and Fosseys as a legal entity was dissolved. As at June 2008, there were 118 Target Country stores throughout Australia.\n\nIn Charters Towers, Queensland the long established Pollard's Store became a Fosseys and is now, most likely the only Target or Target Country store which features leadlight windows.\nFormer Store Formats\n\nUrban by Target\n\nUrban by Target was a format tried by Target initially at South Yarra, Victoria at The Jam Factory, after taking over a closed Virgin Megastore. The format was introduced in 2010, with a second location opened in 2011, at Flemington, Victoria at Flemington Village. A third location was also opened in 2011, at Pasadena, South Australia, at Pasadena Shopping Centre. The format was smaller than a traditional Target department store, and was focused on clothing and home wares. The location at Flemington was closed down, followed by Pasadena, which remained but converted into a traditional Target department store. South Yarra was renovated with the new logo, in black instead of red, although this location was closed down permanently. \n\nTarget Outlet\n\nTarget Outlet was a format tried by Target at the Target in Dandenong, Victoria at Dandenong Plaza. The format was discontinued around 2014.\n\nBaby Target\n\nIn 1996, Target introduced \"Baby Target\" as a standalone store format specifically for baby products. The concept had limited success and was ultimately closed down soon after.\n\nTarget Home\n\nAnother format tried by Target was the homewares-themed store \"Target Home\", but was later discontinued. Target Home stores have since been phased out to become larger Target stores, and still stock a larger range of homewares in a number of locations in Australia and New Zealand including Joondalup and Carousel in WA, Edwardstown in SA, Highpoint and Greensborough in VIC, and Westfield Warringah Mall in NSW and Tauranga, North Island.\nIn March 2007, Target launched a 42-piece winter collection designed by Stella McCartney. A number of metropolitan stores sold out of the range as soon as 10 minutes after opening, and items from the collection soon began appearing for sale on eBay at inflated prices. Another Stella McCartney collection was released in October 2010, to lesser fanfare.\n\nIn May 2007, Target announced its next designer range from Joshua Goot to a mixed reaction, and subsequently produced a collaboration with American designer Zac Posen in April 2008. In the same month, Australian fashion designer Collette Dinnigan released a range of lingerie labelled the 'Wild Hearts' collection.\n\nIn February 2012, Target launched a line of women's lingerie designed by American burlesque dancer and model Dita Von Teese. Throughout 2012, Target also announced designer collaborations for children with Collette Dinnigan and Ksubi and Roberto Cavalli for women.\n\nIn March 2016, Target launched a collection of women's, men's, children's and home wares by Jean-Paul Gaultier.\n"}

It begins in the north at Streatham Hill railway station, being an end-on junction with \"Streatham Hill\" and continues south to Norbury where the A23 becomes \"London Road\". Because Streatham existed in Saxon times, it is likely the road existed as early as 1068, when it is mentioned in literature.\n\nIn 2002 it was voted, in a contentious BBC/Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment poll, to be \"Britain's Worst Street\" – largely thanks to its traffic problems, and a generally poor ambience (run-down shopfronts, damaged pavements). However, it is a busy shopping area in the day, and a busy nightlife area in the evening.\n\nEven before this report had appeared, a plan was being formulated by Transport for London Street Management (who are legally responsible for the road and pavement maintenance, signage and street furniture) and the London Borough of Lambeth's Highways and Streatham Town Centre Management teams to improve Streatham High Road.\n\nThis sets out to \"promote the needs of pedestrians, shoppers, cyclists and public transport before the needs of traffic on the A23\".\n\nThe first phase was implemented in 2004–05, with new lighting and street furniture. Lambeth is also funding a shop front improvement scheme.\n\nAfter 0.6 mile (0.96 km) there is a large junction complex, where \"Tooting Bec Gardens\" (A214) and \"Mitcham Lane\" (A216) join the A23. This is the point where most of the traffic chaos ensues. Following that point the road is relatively straight: it follows the line of the London to Brighton Way Roman road. On the east is Streatham Common; and at the end of the High Road is Norbury Park. Here the final small section is within the London Borough of Croydon.\n\n"}

{"id": "2307785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2307785", "title": "Autobianchi A112", "text": "Autobianchi A112\n\nThe Autobianchi A112 is a supermini produced by the Italian automaker Autobianchi. It was developed using a shrunken version of the contemporary Fiat 128's platform. The mechanicals of the A112 subsequently underpinned the Fiat 127. It was introduced in November 1969, as a replacement for the Bianchina and Primula, and was built until 1986, when it made way for the more modern Autobianchi Y10 (branded in most export markets as the Lancia Y10). Over 1.2 million A112s were produced in Autobianchi's Milan factory.\n\nThe A112 was available only with a 3-door body. It was offered with the OHV engine of 903 cc from the Fiat 850 capable of attaining 42 PS (31 kW). The Autobianchi represented the first appearance of this engine in a front-engine, front-wheel drive configuration which would later become familiar to a wider range of drivers in the top selling Fiat 127 and its derivatives. Claimed power increased to in 1971, but without any mechanical changes having taken place. Performance remained unchanged as well, this was most likely simply a correction to the claimed output.\n\nThe A112 reached a very particular market; by 1984 female buyers represented 35% of A112 owners and about a third were in the 18-24 age range.\n\nIn September 1971 the A112 E (\"E\" for Elegant, which also became its name after the 1973 facelift) was introduced.<ref name=\"TAM77/78\"></ref> This featured a roof painted in a contrasting colour, improved seats, higher grade trimming and equipment, as well as a five-speed gearbox later in life. The mechanics were originally identical to the regular version, now referred to as the \"Normale\", but from 1975 until 1977 the Normale' received a less powerful engine. A performance edition \"Abarth\" was introduced too.\n\nIn March 1973 the A112 received a makeover. The grille was new, with a larger mesh, and the bumpers were now of rubber with chrome insert (although the Normale retained the old metal bumpers with rubber strips). A new style of alloys were also available, and the seats and dashboard underwent some changes. The A112E was renamed Elegant, and was no longer only available in two-tone paintjobs. The Abarth was also available in single paints, and on two-tone models the contrasting shade was restricted to a black bonnet. The Scorpion logos on the flanks were removed, and it received a new chess pattern upholstery. Engines remained 903 cc and 982 cc for the Abarth.\n\nIn 1975 the third series arrived. The insides in the rear were recontoured, so that the car now became a five-seater (instead of four). The easiest way to spot a third series is that it received new, much larger vents on the C-pillars, as well as redesigned taillights - with integrated reversing lights on the Elegant and Abarth. The Abarth also received a new larger 1050 cc engine (\"70HP\"), while the Normale's output dropped to in July 1975. All engines were still pushrod units, derived from the old tipo 100 engine first introduced in the Fiat 600. In 1976, due to new emissions standards, the Elegant lost two horsepower, now down to . Third series Normales still received metal bumpers, but from now on they were painted black (instead of being chromed) and no longer had a rubber strip. This was the last model to have the diamond shaped turn signals on the front fenders, with later models receiving more orthodox rectangular ones. The A112 elegant had metal bumpers with a thick layer of black rubber over it. There was a metal strip horizontal in the middle of the bumpers. \n\nRayton Fissore showed (and then sold) a special-bodied version of the A112 called \"Otas\" in 1976, with aerodynamically styled bodywork reminiscent of that of the Porsche 928.\n\nIn November 1977 the \"Nuova A112\" (new A112) was introduced: The most obvious difference is a slightly taller roof, with a marked edge around the sides. This improved interior habitability considerably. Autobianchi also at this time modified the upmarket version branded as the \"A112 Elegant\" with an engine enlarged to 965 cc, now promising and improved torque. The taillights of the fourth series were different (and short-lived, as they were altered again in 1979) with a stepped appearance, taller towards the outside of the car and narrower towards the center.\n\nLater, there were also \"A112 Elite\" and \"A112 LX\" versions which received even more comfortable equipment. The 903 cc engine of the lesser A112 Normale remained unchanged. Beginning in March 1979, French and Swiss market A112 Abarths came equipped with a standard five-speed transmission, helping lower noise and fuel consumption, especially at higher speeds.\n\nIn July 1979 the car underwent another styling modification, receiving large black plastic cladding on the rear, surrounding new taillights, and new side trim and bumpers. The grille was also new, and there was black plastic wheelarches to link all of the plastic parts together. The extractor vents behind the rear side windows were also larger, of black plastic, and wrapped around the pillar. In terms of transmissions, the five-speed transmission already seen in Abarths in some markets now became available on additional models. The fifth gear was an overgear, while the ratios of the four lower speeds and the final gearing remained unchanged. The front turn signals were moved from the front of the fenders to a spot just in front of the leading edge of the doors, while a small badge denoting the trim level appeared in the turn signal's old place.\n\nIn terms of trim levels, the Normale now became the Junior, and the Elite version was added, a notch above the Elegant in the lineup. There were some very light modifications to the interior. A large, rollback canvas sunroof became available on the Junior, and a rear window wiper became optional across the range. Aside from the new transmission there were no notable mechanical changes. Power outputs remained at 42, 48, and 70 PS (31, 35.5, and 51.5 kW respectively). The Abarth also received the new five-speed gearbox, as well as new alloy wheels and foglights as standard.\n\nA lot of the plastic excesses of the fifth series were reversed for the sixth series, which was introduced in the autumn of 1982. New smoother bumpers, removal of the wheelarch trim, and a less heavy grille treatment brought back some of the original elegance of the A112, while the interior was also completely renovated. Another new version arrived, the top-of-the-line LX, which featured tinted windows, velvet seat trimming, power windows, metallic paintwork, and a digital clock amongst other creature comforts. Mechanically, the LX was identical to the Elite, with the five-speed transmission and 965 cc engine. The Elegant version was discontinued, with the Elite taking its position in the lineup. The sixth series also received new body-colored vents on the C-pillar, and the front corner lights were incorporated into the top of the bumper.\n\nThis was the first A112 to be marketed with Lancia badging, originally only in Sweden and in Switzerland. In Sweden, this car had already been sold by Lancia dealers with \"Autobianchi\" badging. In the Swiss and Swedish markets, the 903 cc engine no longer passed their stricter emissions standards, so the Junior received the same 965 cc engine as did the Elite and LX.\n\nThe seventh series, presented in 1984, only saw minor changes, largely remaining the same as the sixth. The taillights were again redesigned and were now joined by a reflective strip. The rear license plate was relocated to the bumper and the dashboard received modifications, more noticeable in the better equipped Elite and LX versions. The Abarth received standard front foglights, which were optional on the other versions. The Abarth also has red seatbelts. While the Junior retained small hubcaps, and the Abarth received alloys, the rest of the range now received full-face hubcaps. The front corner lights were now white, instead of orange as before. The engines remained as before, all models except the lowest-priced Junior now used five-speed transmissions.\n\nBy this time, only France, Italy and Israel still used the \"Autobianchi\" badge; all others had switched to calling the car a Lancia. At the time of the seventh series introduction, a total of 1,115,000 A112s had been built.\n\nAs the new Autobianchi Y10 was introduced in 1985, the A112 range was cut down considerably, with only the Junior remaining on sale as a low-priced alternative. It was no longer called Junior, however, now being marketed simply as the \"Autobianchi A112\". Other than the name change, there were no design changes to the car. Production continued into 1986, at which point 1,254,178 Autobianchi A112s had been built.\nThe most interesting version was the A112 Abarth, introduced in September 1971 at the same time as the Elegant. It was prepared by the motorsports division of the Fiat Group, at first with a 982 cc engine, obtained by increasing the stroke, coupled to a sportive exhaust, a twin carburetor, and a different camshaft. In 1975, displacement was increased to 1,050 cc, while power climbed from 58 HP to 70 HP at 6600 rpm, for a weight of only . The two engines were offered in parallel until production of the smaller unit ended in late 1976. The 1975 model was also the first A112 to use a (optional) five-speed manual gearbox. These changes turned the A112 into a nervous machine, much admired by young performance enthusiasts.\n\nThe car was entered in various rallying events throughout Europe and even spawned a one-make trophy: the Campionato A112 Abarth spanned eight editions, from 1977 to 1984, and adopted contemporary Group 1 rules, which meant nearly-stock cars. Some famous Italian rally drivers, including Attilio Bettega, Fabrizio Tabaton and Gianfranco Cunico, were among the winners of the championship. The increasing popularity of the A112 in historic rallies and hillclimbs led to the reintroduction of a one-make trophy, called Trofeo A112 Abarth, in 2010. Abarths have often led hard lives, having been preferred by young owners with aggressive driving styles. Formula One driver Olivier Panis is one of many to have crashed an A112 Abarth.\n\nStarting from 1982 this car was also badged as Lancia A112 in some markets outside of Italy.\n\nThe A112 Giovani is a one-off concept car based on the A112 and designed by Pininfarina. It debuted in 1973 at the Geneva Motor Show and was received well by both the press and public. It is based on mostly standard A112 mechanicals but is powered by the 982 cc Abarth engine from the A112 Abarth producing and of torque. The car was named \"Giovani\", the Italian word for youth, as it was designed as an entry level, sporty car for younger buyers. Unlike the standard A112, the Giovani features a convertible roof design with a removable hardtop roof. The body is made mainly from composite plastics and features integrated bumpers, as well as a radiator grille in the shape of the Autobianchi logo. It also does not have a latch on the trunk lid, with the trunk latch only being accessible via the passenger compartment. The interior features a plastic dashboard and metal seat frames with seats made from the same semi-soft plastics often used in boats. The A112 Giovani is currently owned by Italian collector Corrado Lopresto, who also owns the Lancia Sibilo and Lancia Stola concepts.\n\n\nThe A112 was the first modern three-door supermini hatchback to be produced in Europe, arriving 18 months before the more successful Fiat 127. At the time of its launch, its main competitors were booted smaller cars including the Mini, Citroen 2CV, Renault 4 and Hillman Imp. However, the 1970s saw the arrival of a host of small cars (mostly hatchbacks) which met the growing demand for \"supermini\" type cars in the mould of the A112. A year after the launch of the Fiat 127 came the Renault 5. Within a few years, the A112 had gained a host of other competitors including the Ford Fiesta, Peugeot 104, Vauxhall Chevette and Volkswagen Polo, as well as Japanese offerings, the most popular of which in Europe was the Datsun Cherry. This type of car proved hugely popular all over Europe. Despite its popularity on continental markets, it was never offered in Britain, although Fiat did enjoy considerable success there with its 127 and even more so with its Uno successor from 1983. However, its successor, the Y10 (sold in Britain as a Lancia) was available in right-hand drive for the British market from 1985, but was not a strong seller there.\n\n"}

{"id": "2307799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2307799", "title": "In the Garden of Iden", "text": "In the Garden of Iden\n\nIn the Garden of Iden is a 1997 science fiction novel by American writer Kage Baker. Although it is set entirely in the 16th century, in Spain and England, it is a science fiction story revolving around the activities of a group of immortal cyborgs, individuals who appear human but have been transformed by high technology.\n\nMendoza is a cyborg, who, like others of her kind, has been rescued from certain death as a small child and turned into an immortal machine, then made to work for \"The Company\". She loves her work and hates 'mortals'. All that changes when, on her first mission, she encounters love and learns the terrible price she has paid to live forever.\n\nThis novel is the first in a series about \"The Company\" and its servants, human and otherwise. The series continues with \"Sky Coyote\", \"Mendoza in Hollywood\", \"The Graveyard Game\", and \"The Life of the World to Come\". The collection \"Black Projects, White Knights\" consists of Company stories, and there are allusions in the collection \"Mother Ægypt and Other Stories\".\n\nThe story is told by Mendoza, a cyborg botanist. In the introduction, she describes a 24th-century organization called Dr. Zeus Inc., or simply \"The Company\". The Company has the secrets of immortality and time travel. Unfortunately the immortality treatment can only be used on young children; and time travel is difficult, expensive, and only possible when going into the past and returning to your own time. History cannot be changed.\n\nDr. Zeus uses the technology simply to get rich. By travelling far into prehistory, the company creates its own immortal cyborg agents, who then have the mission of preserving cultural artifacts and other valuable items for sale in the 24th century. Usually these items are hidden in safe places, but in the case of extinct species, for instance, they are kept in secret Company caches run by the cyborgs. In the 24th century the Company then 'finds' the long-lost objects and sells them.\n\nThe cyborgs are expected to arrive in the 24th century the old-fashioned way, by living through the intervening millennia. On the way, they can create more cyborgs from those who would otherwise die as children.\n\nMendoza and her companions journey to England, to the county Kent estate of Sir Walter Iden, who keeps a collection of exotic plants in a walled garden. Mendoza's job is to take genetic samples. Iden's estate also includes a recreation of the place where Alexander Iden, a Kentish nobleman, captured and killed Jack Cade, a rebel leader during the civil wars in the previous century. Alexander Iden and Jack Cade are both historical figures, as well as being characters in William Shakespeare's play, \"Henry VI, part 2\". The fictional Sir Walter may have purchased both title and estate rather than inheriting them.\n\nMendoza tells how she is snatched as a child from the Inquisition in Spain, having first been sold by her real parents to some 'noble Christians' who want her for pagan rites, but are instead arrested. In prison she is called Mendoza, after the name used by the pagans. She does not remember ever having a name of her own before that, her parents simply calling her \"daughter\" (\"hija\" in Spanish). She does not even know her family name, or the name of her village. One of the Inquisitors is Joseph, a cyborg, who is able to deliver her to his fellow agents for 'augmentation'.\n\nFifteen years later she returns to Spain for her first mission. Although she trained as a botanist and wants to go the New World, she has to spend time in Europe on an expedition to England. She finds that the expedition leader is Joseph, the cyborg who saved her. He is about 20,000 years old, having been recruited from the Basque region as a child when his village was massacred. Joseph is a Facilitator, a 'fixer', a top agent. He is also world-weary, cynical and irreverent. His passion is his work, like all the cyborgs, but he also has a deep-seated hatred of religious fanaticism, partly because his parents were killed by a cult, partly because of what he has seen in his long life. The group also includes Nefer, whose specialty is farm animals, and Flavius, a technician.\n\nThe mission is to travel to England as part of the entourage of Prince Philip of Spain, who is going to marry Queen Mary. Then they will go to the estate in Kent of Sir Walter Iden, who has been persuaded to let them sample rare plants from his garden. Mendoza is not pleased by all this. She is already deathly afraid of all 'mortals' as she calls them, and is further dismayed by the prospect of going to cold, wet, violent, disease-ridden England.\n\nWhen they arrive, without Flavius who stays in London, two things quickly change her mind. One is a hedge of \"Ilex tormentosum\", or Julius Caesar's Holly, a plant with tremendous medicinal properties. It is already rare and, in the future, it is extinct. The other is Nicholas Harpole, Sir Walter's secretary. Nicholas is \"tall even for an Englishman\" and has a horse-like face but is very intelligent and well-educated. She is immediately attracted to him, and Joseph, always on the lookout for an advantage, encourages her to seduce Nicholas. This she does, and settles in for a long stay, having decided that the Garden is full of unusual plants that will take years to catalogue.\n\nNicholas, it turns out, has a dark past, having been a member of an ecstatic Christian cult that practised sexual freedom. Deciding that the cult leader was simply exploiting his fellows, he broke away and began preaching radical ideas, for which he was arrested and put in chains. Although Nicholas is illegitimate, he had well-connected friends and was freed with the warning to sin no more.\n\nMendoza also has problems. As she matures, she finds she emits \"Crome radiation\", a psychic field which can have unpredictable effects on time and space. This is not supposed to be possible for cyborgs, who are screened for such abilities when recruited. (In a later Company story, we learn that Joseph caused the tests to be fudged because otherwise Mendoza would be tortured to death by the Inquisition.)\n\nAs the novel progresses, she is increasingly torn by love for Nicholas and the need to lie to him, to play her assigned part. Nicholas himself is suspicious of Mendoza and her companions. Old Sir Walter Iden, having been given rejuvenating treatments by Joseph as payment for their stay, decides to sell the estate and move to London. The entire household is already amazed by his transformation from doddering old man to virile middle-age. Joseph is furious but can do nothing. Then, while the household is being inventoried for the sale, Joseph is damaged in an accident which would have killed a normal human. Though he talks his way out of the immediate situation with his usual skill, he is eventually found out by Nicholas, who sees him doing self-repairs to his internal machinery.\n\nNicholas, having been prepared to elope with Mendoza, confronts her, believing her to be a devil in human form. She admits that, even in her own eyes, she is no longer human. Nicholas flees the estate.\n\nLater she learns he has returned to preaching in Rochester, and has been condemned to burn by the new Catholic authorities. She runs away herself to Rochester, but is unable to convince him to recant. At this point Joseph appears, having followed Mendoza. His only purpose now is to prevent her becoming a Company renegade. He denounces Nicholas as just another fake messiah who can only lead others to destruction along with himself. He reveals to Nicholas that he has lived many thousands of years and has yet to see anything resembling the Truth that Nicholas and his like preach. Telling Nicholas that \"of all the burnings I've witnessed, this is one I will actually enjoy\" he takes Mendoza away.\n\nThe next morning, they witness Nicholas' death. Returning to the Iden estate, Joseph promises to pull strings and get Mendoza sent to the New World, as she originally wanted.\n\nIn the final chapter, Mendoza arrives at \"New World One\" in the South American jungle. It is a secret Company base run like a luxury hotel, where the servants are Mayans rescued from sacrifices. She settles into her new air-conditioned existence, with an unknowable future.\n\n\nThis novel is primarily concerned with language, culture and personality. The darker side of \"The Company\" is only hinted at here, with Mendoza resigned to working for an entity that knows everything she is ever going to do, so anything that happens to her is more likely to be planned than accidental.\n\nThe novel provides much detail on Elizabethan language and culture. Technological anachronisms, such as the cyborgs' superhuman abilities, serve only as background to the main action. The Company operatives' most important assets are Joseph's silken tongue and quick wits.\nHowever, Joseph's guidance and actions also lead to Nicholas' downfall, and thus to Mendoza's crash. Having progressed from naïve child to boisterous cadet cyborg to dangerously besotted agent, she is twisted inside, though outwardly numb.\n\nJoseph himself has been a loyal Company man for millennia, acting role after role and seeing all things as temporary. By the end of the novel it is clear that he regards Mendoza as a daughter, not just an operative playing that role for the Company.\n\nA theme introduced here, and recurring in the later stories, is dislike of religious fervor in all its forms, from oppressive establishments to messianic cults and even, later, to fanatic pursuit of vegetarianism, abstinence, and animals' rights.\n\n"}

After the war ended, he founded the interior-decorating business George Spencer. \n\nIn 1961 he published his memoir, \"Crowded Canvas\". \"The New York Times\" described the book as telling the first 50 years of his life, and as for the future, it quoted him stating: \"The First Duke of Marlborough was 52 when he fought the Battle of Blenheim.

From this date its diplomatic activity did not know rest, because the confidence he had gained of Philip IV of Spain and he was in charge to manage a very important part of his political and diplomatic relations during twenty-five years in Italy, Germany and Switzerland, during the decline of the Spanish political power in Europe.\n\nHe was ambassador in Rome (1631) and marched to Bavaria in 1633, territory then at the center of the bloodiest fights of Thirty Years' War. Here, with the position of resident ambassador in the court of Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria, leader of the Holy League, he pursued the union of the pro-Habsburg forces with the German Emperor Ferdinand II and with Catholic powers. In this year, the king Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden died in the battle of Lützen; this settled down a tense calm only interrupted by the murder of the marshal Wallenstein, head of the armies of Ferdinand II, when his alleged treason in favor of Sweden was discovered (no treason on the part of Wallenstein has ever been proven. This is pure speculation) .\n\nIn 1634, the battle of Nördlingen took place between the Swedish armies and those of the German empire supported by Spanish troops, the latter being victorious. In 1636, Emperor Ferdinand II died, and Diet of Regensburg took place for the election of his successor, where Saavedra went as representative of Spain. His diplomatic activity intensified when Richelieu declared war to Spain in 1635, and with the successive defeats of the Spanish troops by the French armies. Ultimately he became Spanish plenipotentiary at Regensburg in 1636 and at Münster in 1648.\n\nAfter the signing of the Treaty of Münster, Saavedra retired into the Madrid convent of the \"Agustinos Recoletos\". Here he died in 1648. He is buried at the Cathedral Church of Saint Mary in Murcia.\n\nIn 1640 Saavedra published the anti-Machiavellian emblem book \"Empresas Políticas. Idea de un príncipe político cristiano\" (\"Political Maxims. Idea of a Christian Political Prince\"), a hundred short essays about the education of a prince. This work was written primarily for the son of King Philip IV. It passed through a number of editions and was translated in several languages. An unfinished historical work, entitled \"Corona gótica, castellana, y austriaca políticamente ilustrada\", appeared in 1646. Another work ascribed to Saavedra, the \"República literaria\", was published posthumously in 1670; it is a satirical discussion on some of the leading characters in the ancient and modern world of letters.\nSaavedra's \"Idea de un príncipe político cristiano\" (\"The Idea of a Christian political prince\", 1640) was a very erudite work that uses the literary sort of emblem, put by Andrea Alciato with his \"Emblemata\" translated in 1549 and that has a mainly moral and philosophical character. His work, however, was mainly inspired by the \"Emblemata política\" (1618), by Jakob Bruck Angermunt, being the intention of the author to compose a guide for the suitable political formation of a Christian prince. As a historian wrote \"Corona gótica, castellana y austríaca\" (1648), that tried to be a biographical repertoire of the Visigothic kings of Spain.\n\nThe style of Saavedra Fajardo is baroque and, sometimes ballast by a barren erudition and a meticulous style.\n\nA Spanish high school in the Infant Don Juan Manuel neighborhood of Murcia is named after him. In Algezares, its birthplace town, there is a school with his name. In addition, the main street of the town is also named after him.\n\nMadrid has a street with his name in the 28011 postal code.\n\n"}

Tanner attended Florida State University; he stood tall and weighed during his active career.\n\nHe is the son of the late Chuck Tanner, who played all or parts of eight seasons in Major League Baseball (1955–62) and managed in the Majors for 19 seasons (1970–88) for the Chicago White Sox, Oakland Athletics, Pittsburgh Pirates and Atlanta Braves. During Bruce Tanner's one season in the Majors — with White Sox — his father was in his final season as skipper of the Pirates.\n\nBorn in New Castle, Pennsylvania, Tanner was selected by the White Sox in the fourth round of the 1983 Major League Baseball draft and was in his third season in the ChiSox farm system when he was recalled from the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons.

It is affiliated with the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth.\n\nSpalding University traces its origins to Nazareth Academy, one of the oldest educational institution west of the Alleghenies. Nazareth Academy was founded in 1814 by the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth and was located in Nelson County near Bardstown, Kentucky. Spalding was named after Mother Catherine Spalding, foundress of the Sisters.\n\nIn 1829 the legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky granted the school a charter allowing the school to confer degrees. In 1920, the Sisters opened Nazareth College in Louisville, Kentucky's first, four-year, Catholic college for women. The Louisville and Nazareth campuses merged. In 1969, the school was renamed Spalding College and in 1971 all instructional activity was moved to the Louisville campus. In 1973, Spalding College became co-educational and an independent college in the Catholic tradition open to students of all faiths and backgrounds. In 1984, Spalding College became Spalding University.\n\nSpalding offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in the areas of health sciences, natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and education.\n\nLocated in downtown Louisville, Spalding University's urban campus is located between the main business/government district of the city and Old Louisville in an area referred to as the South of Broadway (SoBro) neighborhood.\n\nWhen Spalding University, originally called Nazareth College, opened in 1920, its sole building was the 1871 structure known as the Tompkins-Buchanan-Rankin House. This Italianate building was designed and built by architect Henry Whitestone for the family of Joseph T. Tompkins, a wealthy dry-goods merchant and importer. Later, the Buchanans and Rankins lived here. George C. Buchanan was a distiller who aspired to make the mansion one of the greatest in Louisville, and had it redecorated in 1880. Although the facade of this Italianate structure has disappeared, the north and south sides of the original building are visible; on the north are three deeply projecting bay windows, and on the south, a two-story loggia. In 1918 the residence was vacant, so the Sisters of Nazareth purchased it for $75,000 as the site of the college they planned to open in Louisville. The fact that this house is one door north of Presentation Academy, also operated by the Sisters, was fortunate.\n\nAs successive owners occupied the mansion, they added such treasures as a hand-tooled leather ceiling from Florence for one parlor, ebony mantels, and a large hand-carved hat-rack, which Mr. Buchanan purchased at the New Orleans Exposition. The stained glass of the mansion is one of its outstanding features. When Dr. John Coolidge, one-time Director of Harvard's Fogg Art Museum, visited Louisville, he said that Spalding University had the most marvelous display of nineteenth-century stained glass he had ever seen.\n\nErected in 1942, the Administration Building, which was attached to the front wall of the 1871 building, fills not only the space of the two lots north of the original building but also that of the former terrace in front of the mansion. The old stained glass street number, 851, no longer faces the street, but it still gleams brightly in the passageway between the newer building and the old Whitestone mansion.\n\nIn December 1973 the mansion was designated a Kentucky Landmark. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in April 1977.\n\nToday, the Mansion and the complex it forms with its adjoining wings are used primarily for academic and faculty offices and classrooms. In addition to all of the College of Education's programs, the academic units based in the Mansion are business, liberal studies, creative and professional writing, psychology, communication and criminal justice studies.\n\nSpalding's Center for Behavioral Health, a nonprofit public clinic supported and staffed by the School of Professional Psychology, is located in the east wing of the complex, and Spalding's Center of Peace and Spiritual Renewal is located on the top floor of the central Mansion. Mass is still held every Tuesday in the Mansion chapel.\n\nThe primary administrative operations of Spalding University no longer are housed in the Mansion and now are based in the Egan Leadership Center (901 S. Fourth St.), where the office of admissions, most student services and the academic deans are located, and the Third Street Academic Center (845 S. Fourth St.), where the offices of the president and provost exist, as well as the finance, institutional effectiveness, human resources and advancement/fundraising departments.\n\nThe Egan Leadership Center is located at 901 South Fourth Street and is named after Spalding's former President, Sister Eileen Egan. Sister Egan served the university for 25 years until her retirement in 1994. Containing over on three floors, the building houses a 125-seat lectorium and the university bookstore on the first level. The second and third floors house student services offices, such as admissions, the office of the registrar, financial aid, advising and student development and campus life.\n\nHome of the Spalding art department, with studio classrooms and individual studios offered to students participating in the program.\n\nOriginally opened in 1961, the residence formerly known as Our Lady of Louisville Hall only housed 116 students. An addition was constructed and opened in 1968 bumping the total occupancy to 350 residents. In 1970 the hall was renamed in honor of Sister Charles Mary Morrison who served as registrar and Dean from 1925 to 1950. The building currently houses undergraduate and graduate students in 165 dormitory-style rooms on the north side of the building and shares the south side with the Kentucky College of Art and Design (KyCAD).\n\nThe Spalding Suites opened in the fall of 2011 and are designed as apartment-style living for students who choose to live on campus. The Suites were designed for true community living as all residents share a common living room, kitchen and bathroom within their suite.\n\nResidents can choose to live in a private bedroom within an 8-person suite, a double bedroom within an 8-person suite or a double bedroom within a 4-person suite. Bedrooms come equipped with a standard twin size bed, desk and chair, cable box, and wardrobe. All bedrooms have windows and blinds and a private lock.\n\nThe building at 824 S. Fourth St. is the home of Spalding's men's and women's basketball and women's volleyball teams, as well as the Golden Eagles' NCAA Division III athletic department. It is also famous as the location where Louisvillian Muhammad Ali was introduced to boxing as a young boy in 1954. At that time, the boxing gym in the lower level of the building was called the Columbia Gym. The lower level of the building is now the site of Spalding's student fitness center, lounge and health clinic as well as the athletic department offices. The first level includes the basketball/volleyball courts as well as a 700-seat auditorium. An upper level includes a ballroom that is used for campus events.\n\nThe building's name was changed from Spalding University Center to Columbia Gym on Jan. 17, 2018 in honor of Ali's history there. The renaming took place on what would have been Ali's 76th birthday. The introduction of Ali (then Clay) to boxing at Columbia Gym was serendipitous and has become a key part of Ali lore. He stopped by the building for a Louisville Service Club event that was occurring upstairs and offered free snacks. He parked his red Schwinn bicycle out front while he went inside, and when he came back out, it had been stolen. An irate Clay was told out to report the theft to a local police officer named Joe Martin, who was on site because he also happened to run the Columbia Gym and train young boxers. Clay informed Martin that his bike had been stolen and said he planned to beat up the thief. Martin replied to Clay that if he wanted to do that, he better learn to fight first, leading him to try boxing.\n\nIn honor of Ali and Martin's encounter, a replica red bike now hangs over the front entrance of Columbia Gym.\n\nIn 1963 Spalding University purchased the former Columbia Auditorium for use in administrative, recreational, athletic, religious, and cultural events, including public lectures by notable public figures. The auditorium seats about 700 people in its main floor and balcony.\n\nThe building was designed by Louisville architect Thomas J. Nolan in 1925 in a classic style in accordance with Vignola. The external walls are of Bedford limestone with buff brick trim. Interior floors and staircases are marble. The Knights of Columbus commissioned the building to serve as a center for their many activities.\n\nAfter the economic depression of 1929, the Knights of Columbus could not maintain it, so it was used by other groups. During World War II it was a service club for military personnel. It was also used by the Louisville Orchestra in that group's early days. Perhaps the best-known use of the gymnasium in the building was the housing of Golden Gloves Boxing events during the 1950s. It was there that Cassius Clay (later Muhammad Ali) trained as a teenager.\n\nSpalding University is a member of Division III of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which it joined fully in 2012. The Golden Eagles have 14 varsity sports programs (six men's, eight women's) and are members of the St. Louis Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SLIAC). About 30 percent of Spalding's undergraduate students participate in varsity sports. Spalding's athletic director is Roger Burkman, who was a member of the University of Louisville's 1980 NCAA Division I basketball championship team.\n\nIn 2006, Spalding changed the name of its athletic nickname from Pelicans to Golden Eagles via a selection committee that included student input. The Golden Eagle was picked because it embodies strength, courage and strong vision. The image of the Pelican, which embodies peace, justice, service and spiritual values, remains on the university's official seal. In 2018, Spalding unveiled its first official Golden Eagle mascot, a blue-and-gold bird named Ollie, as selected by a campus-wide vote.\n\n\n\n"}

She was born at Beaudesert Castle in Warwickshire.. Her grandfather was Peter de Montfort (1205-1265), the first Speaker of the House of Commons, whose wife was Alice Audley.\n\nHer marriage to William Montagu was arranged by Eleanor of Castile, the first wife of King Edward I of England. Edward was eager to make peace with the aristocracy after the battle, and things were fairly well patched up within a few years. His wife’s role in arranging the marriage was part of an elaborate system of arranged marriages designed to reinforce the power of the King and his aristocracy.\n\nBoth Elizabeth and her husband came from wealthy families, and they donated some of their money to various causes. Elizabeth was a major benefactor of the Priory of St Frideswide, Oxford, now Christ Church Cathedral at Oxford University. Her tomb now lies between the Latin Chapel, whose construction she funded, and the Dean’s Chapel, where she was originally buried under its magnificent painted ceiling (now faded by time).\n\nShe also donated a large piece of land to St. Frideswide in exchange for a chantry. This meant that two chantry priests would say daily mass in black robes bearing the Montacute and Montfort coats of arms. This continued until the Reformation.

The term describes a critical view of overconsumption and excessive production of short-lived or disposable items over durable goods that can be repaired.\n\nIn its August 1, 1955 issue Life magazine published an article titled \"\"Throwaway Living\"\".\nThis article has been cited as the source that first used the term \"throw-away society\".\n\nAs a consequence of economic growth, we have seen both increased production and increased product waste during the last century. Between the start of New York City waste collections in 1905 and 2005 there was a tenfold rise in \"product waste\" (packaging and old products), from 92 to 1,242 pounds (42 to 563 kilograms) per person per year. Containers and packaging now represent 32 percent of all municipal solid waste. Non-durable goods (defined as products in use for less than three years) constitute 27 percent, while durable goods comprise 16 percent.\n\nDisposable tableware was a key part of the business strategy of chain fast food restaurants in the US. In order for the business model to work, fast food chains found it economically advantageous to convince consumers through advertising campaigns to carry their own tableware to a waste bins, in order to avoid labor expenses incurred in clearing tables. By establishing a custom in which customers are encouraged to carry disposables, some of the internal costs of the disposable tableware can be offset.\n\nIn 2002, Taiwan began taking action to reduce the use of disposable tableware at institutions and businesses, and to reduce the use of plastic bags. Yearly, the nation of 17.7 million people was producing of disposable tableware waste and of waste plastic bags, and increasing measures have been taken in the years since then to reduce the amount of waste. In 2013, Taiwan's Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) banned outright the use of disposable tableware in the nation's 968 schools, government agencies and hospitals. The ban is expected to eliminate of waste like disposable cups yearly.\n\nIn Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, laws banning use of disposable food and drink containers at large-scale events have been enacted. Such a ban has been in place in Munich, Germany since 1991, applying to all city facilities and events. This includes events of all sizes, including very large ones (Christmas market, Auer-Dult Faire, Oktoberfest and Munich City Marathon). For small events of a few hundred people, the city has arranged for a corporation offer rental of crockery and dishwasher equipment. In part through this regulation, Munich reduced the waste generated by Oktoberfest, which attracts tens of thousands of people, from 11,000 metric tons in 1990 to 550 tons in 1999.\n\nChina produces about 57 billion pairs of single-use chopsticks yearly, of which half are exported. About 45 percent are made from trees – about 3.8 million of them – mainly cotton wood, birch, and spruce, the remainder being made from bamboo. Japan uses about 24 billion pairs of these disposables per year, and globally about 80 billion pairs are thrown away by about 1.4 million people. Reusable chopsticks in restaurants have a lifespan of 130 meals. In Japan, with disposable ones costing about 2 cents and reusable ones costing typically $1.17, the reusables better the $2.60 breakeven cost. Campaigns in several countries to reduce this waste are beginning to have some effect.\n\nGarbage produced because of the rise in disposable products is often shipped from richer to poorer nations, causing environmental and social problems for developing nations. Most notable are the large shipments of trash from North America and Western Europe to Africa and Asia due to the relatively low cost of disposal. By the 1990s, over half of all nations in Africa have faced negative externalities from toxic waste dumped by richer countries. Waste, both toxic and non-toxic is often dumped without safety regulations. It is thrown in unlined and unregulated landfills where it contaminates soil and water, and even burnt, which circulates toxins in the air. Recently, electronic waste shipped to Nigeria has increased due to higher consumption of electronics by North America Europe, with hundreds of shipments of old electronics dropped off at Lagos, Nigeria, every month. A significantly large percentage of the trash being hazardous waste shipped with the \"explicit intent of cheap (and unsafe) disposal\". China, also, receives huge amounts of waste, often toxic material, averaging 1.9 million tons per year, because companies find it cheaper to ship garbage away rather than dispose of it themselves. \n\nIn 2004, a University of Arizona study indicates that forty to fifty percent of all edible food never gets eaten. Every year $43 billion worth of edible food is estimated to be thrown away.\n\n\"Planned obsolescence\" is a manufacturing philosophy developed in the 1920s and 1930s, when mass production became popular. The goal is to make a product or part that will fail, or become less desirable over time or after a certain amount of use. Vance Packard, author of \"The Waste Makers\", book published in 1960, called this \"the systematic attempt of business to make us wasteful, debt-ridden, permanently discontented individuals.\"\n\nProducers make goods disposable rather than durable so that consumers must continue to repurchase the good, earning the producer a steady supply of customers, rather than a one-time purchase. Profit is maximized for the firm when the usefulness of a good is \"uneconomically short\", because firms can spend the least amount possible creating a nondurable good, which they sell repeatedly to the customer.\n\nGoods are often replaced even before their usefulness runs out. The perceived durability of a good in a throwaway society is often less than its physical durability. For example, in fast fashion, consumers buy the latest, novelty item because producers market styles that pass with the seasons. There is pressure on producers to advertise an increased number of \"seasons\", creating new styles so consumers can update their wardrobes often by buying cheap and flimsy, yet stylish clothes to keep up with current fashion trends. Items that once were considered durable items are now almost exclusively disposable, so it is actually more difficult for consumers who want a durable version to find anywhere selling one. The shift to disposable was ostensibly because of reasons such as convenience or hygiene, even if the inconvenience of using a durable version is very slight, or there is no proven increase in hygiene. This can lead to higher costs over time, more waste produced, more resources used, and lesser quality goods.\n\nNot only has there been a movement by manufacturers towards goods that are less durable and not maintainable, producers have also withheld technology that would make common goods more durable, such as in the manufacture of light bulbs.\n\nPope Francis frequently speaks about a \"throwaway culture\" in which unwanted items and unwanted people, such as the unborn, the elderly, and the poor, are discarded as waste. In his encyclical Laudato si', he discusses pollution, waste, the lack of recycling, and the destruction of the Earth as symptoms of this throwaway culture.\n\nFrancis stated that in a throwaway culture, even human lives are seen as disposable. He also cited the dangers of this culture in connection with immigration, saying, \"A change of attitude towards migrants and refugees is needed on the part of everyone, moving away from attitudes of defensiveness and fear, indifference and marginalization – all typical of a throwaway culture – towards attitudes based on a culture of encounter, the only culture capable of building a better, more just and fraternal world.\"\n\n"}

Founded in 1872, the club represents the best sportsmen in the University of Cambridge. Membership is by election only, and the usual criterion is that the candidate should have his Blue, to have competed in a match or race against the University of Oxford, in his particular sport. Many famous sporting names have been, or are, members – Rob Andrew, Mike Atherton, Chris Brasher, Ted Dexter, Gavin Hastings, Tony Lewis, and George Nash to name just a few.\n\nApplication for membership is open to any man who is either a member of any college at the University of Cambridge or who has been admitted \"ad eundem\" to the University. He must have spent at least one term in residence, and must have earned a Full Blue, Half Blue or Second Team Colours (in a full blue sport) by representing the University against Oxford in a Varsity match.\n\nProspective members are elected in the style of a traditional English gentlemen's club. A prospective applicant must be proposed, seconded and have six further members sign their application form. The proposer is normally the team captain for the relevant sport and the seconder must be a member of the Hawks' Committee. The application is then reviewed by the committee: two \"no\" votes will reject an applicant, and he may not be proposed again at a later date. Certainly in recent years this has been extremely rare: as long as a prospective applicant has the relevant sporting credentials he is almost always admitted.\n\nMembers are admitted for life. The number of \"Hawks-in-residence\" at the University is limited to 230, not including MAs; there are several thousand members worldwide.\n\nOccasionally, individuals are admitted as an \"Honorary Hawk\" without fulfilling the above criteria (for example Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who did not study at Cambridge).\n\nSince 1993 individuals have also been elected to The \"Hawks Dining Rights Club\". Members may use the clubhouse but do not become Hawks. Neither the Cambridge-only nor the men-only restrictions apply in this case, and the majority of members of this type are local business people and professionals who contribute to the costs of running the Club, and to \"The Hawks’ Trust\" which is a charity supporting all sportsmen and women at the University. There are slightly fewer dining rights members than Hawks-in-residence, and the number peaked at 160 in 1998.\n\nThe Club colours are maroon and gold; members may wear the Club tie. Honorary members and Dining rights members wear a plain tie with a gold Hawk.\n\nThe Club's Committee consists of a President, Honorary Secretary and eight ordinary members, and is elected each academic year by the Hawks-in-residence.\n\nThere is a Management Committee of the Trustees, the President and the Secretary of the Club, the Stewards, the Administrator and the DRC President, who guide the Club's development.\n\nThe Hawks' Club was formed in 1872 when a proposal to allow members of other colleges into the \"St John's College Eagles\" club was rejected. This led to the Hawks' being set up as an equivalent club university-wide. In its early history it was primarily a cricket club, but by the turn of the century other sports were well represented.\n\nAs is common with student-run organisations, records are patchy in places and old lists of presidents and members have long been lost. The record is better for the period 1889–1963, as during this time a picture of each year's president was added to a display in the clubhouse, and these have survived to the present day. During the 1950s a number of subsequently notable sportsmen were presidents, and several are listed below.\n\nIt is not known whether a Blue was originally a prerequisite for membership; some early presidents do not appear to have competed against Oxford in any sport. However, the personal 'suitability' of candidates for membership does not appear to have changed since the Club was founded. The Club website states that \"\"Candidates have to be clubbable\"\" (i.e. \"clubbable\" in the sense of a traditional gentlemen's club) and \"\"the Hawks' Club remains unashamedly elite\"\", claiming to include only \"\"the top one per cent\"\" of University sportsmen.\n\nThe clubhouse was originally on Trinity Street, but by the 1890s it had moved to a St John's College property in All Saints' Passage. It remained there until 1966 when financial troubles meant the property had to be sold, despite surviving through both world wars, during which the Club was closed. After this it briefly occupied the same premises as the Pitt Club, until conflicts of interest regarding the differing objectives of the two clubs made this no longer possible. \n\nThere was no clubhouse until 1986, when a four-storey building at 18 Portugal Place became available. This property was bought by a group of members, who restored it from its previous existence as a dilapidated hotel staff hostel. The restored clubhouse was opened by the Duke of Edinburgh in October 1992. It consists of a bar, members' lounge, dining room space for some 25-30 people, and the Club steward's flat on the top floor.\n\nResident Hawks voted in advisory votes in 2017 (85% in favour) and January 2019 (89% in favour) on the question of allowing resident \"Ospreys\" (Cambridge women's sports club) to pay for access arrangements to the Hawks’ clubhouse. 1,400 non-resident Hawks (out of 4,480 members) voted 89% in favour of the proposal in an online ballot run by Electoral Reform Services in February and March 2019.\n\nThe Club actively supports students who have financial difficulties keeping up their sport. Each year the Club awards a number of bursaries to members of the University under the auspices of the \"Hawks' Charitable Trust\". These awards are equally available to both men and women, and total several thousand pounds each year.\n\nThe Club promotes \"Rumboogie\" and \"Resurrection\", events each Wednesday and Sunday evening at the Cambridge nightclubs \"Ballare\" and \"Kuda\" (more commonly known as \"Cindies\" and \"Life\" to the student population). At the end of each Michaelmas term it hosts a dinner in London for its members, usually at one of the large hotels, the night before the Varsity Rugby Match. It also hosts an event each June during May Week in the style of a Cambridge May Ball - \"The Hawks' Event\", at Fenner's Cricket Ground, which is organised and run by the Committee. In recent years a \"Hawks' Charity Dinner\" has been held in Lent term and a \"Charity Ball\" in Michaelmas in conjunction with the Ospreys' Club.\n\nin 2012, the Club raised £4000 for a local charity that aims to help disadvantaged children access sporting initiatives.\n\nIn 2004 two Club awards were introduced: \"Hawk of the year\" and \"Team of the year\":\n\nIn 2010, the \"International Honours Book\" was created to record and detail the representative achievements of its members. There are currently full internationals in residence in fencing, squash, rifle shooting, rowing and rugby union.\n\nAn old boys magazine called \"The Hawk\" is published aperiodically. the most recent issue was No. 9, published in October 2005. The magazine includes, among other things, news of current University teams and results, obituaries of notable members, and Club notices.\n\nOn 17 November 2010, the Hawks' Club launched the Hawks' Talks Speaker Series in conjunction with the Cambridge Union Society. Designed to bring distinguished members of the Club and other notable sportsmen to Cambridge, the Series seeks to host one major sporting-related speaker at the Union each term. \n\nList of Speakers in the Hawks' Talks Series: \n17 Nov. 2010: Gavin Hastings (CURUFC, Scotland & Lions); \n18 Feb. 2011: Mike Brearley (CUCC, MCC & England)\n\nMembers have various reciprocal rights with a number of similar clubs around the world.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n\nOverseas\n\n\nNotable members include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The group is led by singer-songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Fred Thomas (former member of His Name Is Alive). Albums by the group are known for soundscapes which hearken back to Detroit soul.\n\nThe band was originally conceived as a basement recording project and did not play any live shows until 2002. The band built up a considerable following on the back of numerous limited-edition 7\" record and CD-R releases, resulting in the indie pop albums \"All Your Summer Songs\", released in 2003 on Polyvinyl Records, and \"Every Night\", released in 2004 on Polyvinyl. \"All Your Summer Songs\" was listed as one of the top 50 albums of 2003 by Pitchfork. \"Every Night\" introduced new singer Betty Marie Barnes, who became the nearest to a permanent female singer that the band ever had.\n\nBy 2007, Barnes had semi-left the band and Thomas took over as the band's sole front person. SLGTM's music also changed and the resulting \"Fill Up The Room\" (2007, K Recs) album was more adventurous both lyrically and musically than the band's previous two albums.\n\nFollowing another European tour in 2008, Thomas retired the band to concentrate on other projects including City Center, and his record label, Life Like.\n\nThe band reunited in 2012 with a changed line-up, and released \"Sunglasses\" on Polyvinyl Records. For Record Store Day 2012, \"All Your Summer Songs\" was re-issued on white vinyl in a special limited edition of 250. The band released \"One Kiss Ends It All\" in 2013, and continued touring into 2015.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2307848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2307848", "title": "Hicklin test", "text": "Hicklin test\n\nThe Hicklin test is a legal test for obscenity established by the English case Regina v. Hicklin (1868). At issue was the statutory interpretation of the word \"obscene\" in the Obscene Publications Act 1857, which authorized the destruction of obscene books. The court held that all material tending \"to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences\" was obscene, regardless of its artistic or literary merit.\n\nThe modern English law of obscenity began with the Obscene Publications Act 1857, also known as Lord Campbell's Act. Lord Campbell, the Chief Justice of Queen's Bench, introduced the bill, which provided for the seizure and summary disposition of obscene and pornographic materials. The Act also granted authority to issue search warrants for premises suspected of housing such materials.\n\n\"Regina v. Hicklin\" involved one Henry Scott, who resold copies of an anti-Catholic pamphlet entitled \"The Confessional Unmasked: shewing the depravity of the Romish priesthood, the iniquity of the Confessional, and the questions put to females in confession.\" When the pamphlets were ordered destroyed as obscene, Scott appealed the order to the court of Quarter Sessions. Benjamin Hicklin, the official in charge of such orders as Recorder, revoked the order of destruction. Hicklin held that Scott's purpose had not been to corrupt public morals but to expose problems within the Catholic Church; hence, Scott's intention was innocent. The authorities appealed Hicklin's reversal, bringing the case to the consideration of the Court of Queen's Bench.\n\nChief Justice Cockburn, on April 29, 1868, reinstated the order of the lower court, holding that Scott's intention was immaterial if the publication was obscene in fact. Justice Cockburn reasoned that the Obscene Publications Act allowed banning of a publication if it had a \"tendency… to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences, and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall.\" \"Hicklin\" therefore allowed portions of a suspect work to be judged independently of context. If any portion of a work was deemed obscene, the entire work could be outlawed.\n\nAdoption of obscenity laws in the United States was largely due to the efforts of Anthony Comstock. Comstock's intense lobbying led to the passage in 1873 of an anti-obscenity statute known as the Comstock Act. Comstock was appointed postal inspector to enforce the new law. Twenty-four states passed similar prohibitions on materials distributed within the states. The law criminalized not only sexually explicit material, but also material dealing with birth control and abortion. Although lower courts in the U.S. had used the Hicklin standard sporadically since 1868, it was not until 1879, when prominent federal judge Samuel Blatchford upheld the obscenity conviction of D. M. Bennett using \"Hicklin\", that the constitutionality of the Comstock Law became firmly established. In 1896, the Supreme Court in \"Rosen v. United States\", , adopted the Hicklin test as the appropriate test of obscenity.\n\nHowever, in 1933, the Hicklin test ended on the federal level when, in \"United States v. One Book Called Ulysses\", 72 F.2d 705 (2d Cir. 1933), Judge John Woolsey found \"Ulysses\" to not be obscene. Avoiding the Hicklin test, he said instead that in evaluating obscenity, a court must consider (1) the work as a whole, not just selected passages that could be interpreted out of context; (2) the effect on an average, rather than the most susceptible person; and (3) contemporary community standards. Finally, adults could read something without worrying if it would corrupt a child.\n\nFinally, in 1957, the Supreme Court ruled in \"Roth v. United States\", that the \"Hicklin\" test was inappropriate. In \"Roth\", Justice Brennan, writing for the majority, noted that some American courts had adopted the Hicklin standard, but that later decisions more commonly relied upon the question of \"whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.\" This \"Roth test\" became essentially the new definition of obscenity in the United States.\n\n"}

The name comes from the fact that it is the special orthogonal group of order 4.\n\nIn this article \"rotation\" means \"rotational displacement\". For the sake of uniqueness rotation angles are assumed to be in the segment except where mentioned or clearly implied by the context otherwise.\n\nA \"fixed plane\" is a plane for which every vector in the plane is unchanged after the rotation. An \"invariant plane\" is a plane for which every vector in the plane, although it may be affected by the rotation, remains in the plane after the rotation.\n\nFour-dimensional rotations are of two types: simple rotations and double rotations.\n\nA simple rotation about a rotation centre leaves an entire plane through (axis-plane) fixed. Every plane that is completely orthogonal to intersects in a certain point . Each such point is the centre of the 2D rotation induced by in . All these 2D rotations have the same rotation angle .\n\nHalf-lines from in the axis-plane are not displaced; half-lines from orthogonal to are displaced through ; all other half-lines are displaced through an angle less than .\n\nFor each rotation of 4-space (fixing the origin), there is at least one pair of orthogonal 2-planes and each of which is invariant and whose direct sum is all of 4-space. Hence operating on either of these planes produces an ordinary rotation of that plane. For almost all (all of the 6-dimensional set of rotations except for a 3-dimensional subset), the rotation angles in plane and in plane – both assumed to be nonzero – are different. The unequal rotation angles and satisfying , are almost uniquely determined by . Assuming that 4-space is oriented, then the orientations of the 2-planes and can be chosen consistent with this orientation in two ways. If the rotation angles are unequal (), is sometimes termed a \"double rotation\".\n\nIn that case of a double rotation, and are the only pair of invariant planes, and half-lines from the origin in , are displaced through and respectively, and half-lines from the origin not in or are displaced through angles strictly between and .\n\nIf the rotation angles of a double rotation are equal then there are infinitely many invariant planes instead of just two, and all half-lines from are displaced through the same angle. Such rotations are called isoclinic or equiangular rotations, or Clifford displacements. Beware: not all planes through are invariant under isoclinic rotations; only planes that are spanned by a half-line and the corresponding displaced half-line are invariant.\n\nAssuming that a fixed orientation has been chosen for 4-dimensional space, isoclinic 4D rotations may be put into two categories. To see this, consider an isoclinic rotation , and take an orientation-consistent ordered set of mutually perpendicular half-lines at (denoted as ) such that and span an invariant plane, and therefore and also span an invariant plane. Now assume that only the rotation angle is specified. Then there are in general four isoclinic rotations in planes and with rotation angle , depending on the rotation senses in and .\n\nWe make the convention that the rotation senses from to and from to are reckoned positive. Then we have the four rotations , , and . and are each other's inverses; so are and . As long as lies between 0 and , these four rotations will be distinct.\n\nIsoclinic rotations with like signs are denoted as \"left-isoclinic\"; those with opposite signs as \"right-isoclinic\". Left- and right-isoclinic rotations are represented respectively by left- and right-multiplication by unit quaternions; see the paragraph \"Relation to quaternions\" below.\n\nThe four rotations are pairwise different except if or . The angle corresponds to the identity rotation; corresponds to the central inversion, given by the negative of the identity matrix. These two elements of SO(4) are the only ones that are simultaneously left- and right-isoclinic.\n\nLeft- and right-isocliny defined as above seem to depend on which specific isoclinic rotation was selected. However, when another isoclinic rotation with its own axes , , , is selected, then one can always choose the order of , , , such that can be transformed into by a rotation rather than by a rotation-reflection (that is, so that the ordered basis , , , is also consistent with the same fixed choice of orientation as , , , ). Therefore, once one has selected an orientation (that is, a system of axes that is universally denoted as right-handed), one can determine the left or right character of a specific isoclinic rotation.\n\nSO(4) is a noncommutative compact 6-dimensional Lie group.\n\nEach plane through the rotation centre is the axis-plane of a commutative subgroup isomorphic to SO(2). All these subgroups are mutually conjugate in SO(4).\n\nEach pair of completely orthogonal planes through is the pair of invariant planes of a commutative subgroup of SO(4) isomorphic to .\n\nThese groups are maximal tori of SO(4), which are all mutually conjugate in SO(4). See also Clifford torus.\n\nAll left-isoclinic rotations form a noncommutative subgroup of SO(4), which is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of unit quaternions. All right-isoclinic rotations likewise form a subgroup of SO(4) isomorphic to . Both and are maximal subgroups of SO(4).\n\nEach left-isoclinic rotation commutes with each right-isoclinic rotation. This implies that there exists a direct product with normal subgroups and ; both of the corresponding factor groups are isomorphic to the other factor of the direct product, i.e. isomorphic to . (This is not SO(4) or a subgroup of it, because and are not disjoint: the identity and the central inversion each belong to both and .)\n\nEach 4D rotation is in two ways the product of left- and right-isoclinic rotations and . and are together determined up to the central inversion, i.e. when both and are multiplied by the central inversion their product is again.\n\nThis implies that × is the universal covering group of SO(4) — its unique double cover — and that and are normal subgroups of SO(4). The identity rotation and the central inversion form a group C}} of order 2, which is the centre of SO(4) and of both and . The centre of a group is a normal subgroup of that group. The factor group of C in SO(4) is isomorphic to SO(3) × SO(3). The factor groups of by C and of by C are each isomorphic to SO(3). Similarly, the factor groups of SO(4) by and of SO(4) by are each isomorphic to SO(3).\n\nThe topology of SO(4) is the same as that of the Lie group SO(3) × Spin(3) = SO(3) × SU(2), namely the topology of . However, it is noteworthy that, as a Lie group, SO(4) is not a direct product of Lie groups, and so it is not isomorphic to .\n\nThe odd-dimensional rotation groups do not contain the central inversion and are simple groups.\n\nThe even-dimensional rotation groups do contain the central inversion and have the group as their centre. From SO(6) onwards they are almost simple in the sense that the factor groups of their centres are simple groups.\n\nSO(4) is different: there is no conjugation by any element of SO(4) that transforms left- and right-isoclinic rotations into each other. Reflections transform a left-isoclinic rotation into a right-isoclinic one by conjugation, and vice versa. This implies that under the group O(4) of \"all\" isometries with fixed point the subgroups and are mutually conjugate and so are not normal subgroups of O(4). The 5D rotation group SO(5) and all higher rotation groups contain subgroups isomorphic to O(4). Like SO(4), all even-dimensional rotation groups contain isoclinic rotations. But unlike SO(4), in SO(6) and all higher even-dimensional rotation groups any pair of isoclinic rotations through the same angle is conjugate. The sets of all isoclinic rotations are not even subgroups of SO(2), let alone normal subgroups.\n\nSO(4) is commonly identified with the group of orientation-preserving isometric linear mappings of a 4D vector space with inner product over the real numbers onto itself.\n\nWith respect to an orthonormal basis in such a space SO(4) is represented as the group of real 4th-order orthogonal matrices with determinant +1.\n\nA 4D rotation given by its matrix is decomposed into a left-isoclinic and a right-isoclinic rotation as follows:\n\nLet\nbe its matrix with respect to an arbitrary orthonormal basis.\n\nCalculate from this the so-called \"associate matrix\"\n\nand\nThere are exactly two sets of and such that and . They are each other's opposites.\n\nThe rotation matrix then equals\n\nThis formula is due to Van Elfrinkhof (1897).\n\nThe first factor in this decomposition represents a left-isoclinic rotation, the second factor a right-isoclinic rotation. The factors are determined up to the negative 4th-order identity matrix, i.e. the central inversion.\n\nA point in 4-dimensional space with Cartesian coordinates may be represented by a quaternion .\n\nA left-isoclinic rotation is represented by left-multiplication by a unit quaternion . In matrix-vector language this is\n\nLikewise, a right-isoclinic rotation is represented by right-multiplication by a unit quaternion , which is in matrix-vector form\n\nIn the preceding section (#Isoclinic decomposition) it is shown how a general 4D rotation is split into left- and right-isoclinic factors.\n\nIn quaternion language Van Elfrinkhof's formula reads\n\nor, in symbolic form,\n\nAccording to the German mathematician Felix Klein this formula was already known to Cayley in 1854.\n\nQuaternion multiplication is associative. Therefore,\nwhich shows that left-isoclinic and right-isoclinic rotations commute.\n\nThe four eigenvalues of a 4D rotation matrix generally occur as two conjugate pairs of complex numbers of unit magnitude. If an eigenvalue is real, it must be ±1, since a rotation leaves the magnitude of a vector unchanged. The conjugate of that eigenvalue is also unity, yielding a pair of eigenvectors which define a fixed plane, and so the rotation is simple. In quaternion notation, a proper (i.e., non-inverting) rotation in SO(4) is a proper simple rotation if and only if the real parts of the unit quaternions and are equal in magnitude and have the same sign. If they are both zero, all eigenvalues of the rotation are unity, and the rotation is the null rotation. If the real parts of and are not equal then all eigenvalues are complex, and the rotation is a double rotation.\n\nOur ordinary 3D space is conveniently treated as the subspace with coordinate system 0XYZ of the 4D space with coordinate system UXYZ. Its rotation group SO(3) is identified with the subgroup of SO(4) consisting of the matrices\n\nIn Van Elfrinkhof's formula in the preceding subsection this restriction to three dimensions leads to , , , , or in quaternion representation: .\nThe 3D rotation matrix then becomes\n\nwhich is the representation of the 3D rotation by its Euler–Rodrigues parameters: .\n\nThe corresponding quaternion formula , where , or, in expanded form:\nis known as the Hamilton–Cayley formula.\n\nRotations in 3D space are made mathematically much more tractable by the use of spherical coordinates. Any rotation in 3D can be characterized by a fixed axis of rotation and an invariant plane perpendicular to that axis. Without loss of generality, we can take the -plane as the invariant plane and the -axis as the fixed axis. Since radial distances are not affected by rotation, we can characterize a rotation by its effect on the unit sphere (2-sphere) by spherical coordinates referred to the fixed axis and invariant plane:\n\nBecause , the points lie on the 2-sphere. A point at rotated by an angle about the -axis is specified simply by . While hyperspherical coordinates are also useful in dealing with 4D rotations, an even more useful coordinate system for 4D is provided by Hopf coordinates , which are a set of three angular coordinates specifying a position on the 3-sphere. For example:\n\nBecause , the points lie on the 3-sphere.\n\nIn 4D space, every rotation about the origin has two invariant planes which are completely orthogonal to each other and intersect at the origin, and are rotated by two independent angles and . Without loss of generality, we can choose, respectively, the - and -planes as these invariant planes. A rotation in 4D of a point through angles and is then simply expressed in Hopf coordinates as .\n\nEvery rotation in 3D space has an invariant axis-line which is unchanged by the rotation. The rotation is completely specified by specifying the axis of rotation and the angle of rotation about that axis. Without loss of generality, this axis may be chosen as the -axis of a Cartesian coordinate system, allowing a simpler visualization of the rotation.\n\nIn 3D space, the spherical coordinates may be seen as a parametric expression of the 2-sphere. For fixed they describe circles on the 2-sphere which are perpendicular to the -axis and these circles may be viewed as trajectories of a point on the sphere. A point on the sphere, under a rotation about the -axis, will follow a trajectory as the angle varies. The trajectory may be viewed as a rotation parametric in time, where the angle of rotation is linear in time: , with being an \"angular velocity\".\n\nAnalogous to the 3D case, every rotation in 4D space has at least two invariant axis-planes which are left invariant by the rotation and are completely orthogonal (i.e. they intersect at a point). The rotation is completely specified by specifying the axis planes and the angles of rotation about them. Without loss of generality, these axis planes may be chosen to be the - and -planes of a Cartesian coordinate system, allowing a simpler visualization of the rotation.\n\nIn 4D space, the Hopf angles parameterize the 3-sphere. For fixed they describe a torus parameterized by and , with being the special case of the Clifford torus in the - and -planes. These tori are not the usual tori found in 3D-space. While they are still 2D surfaces, they are embedded in the 3-sphere. The 3-sphere can be stereographically projected onto the whole Euclidean 3D-space, and these tori are then seen as the usual tori of revolution. It can be seen that a point specified by undergoing a rotation with the - and -planes invariant will remain on the torus specified by . The trajectory of a point can be written as a function of time as and stereographically projected onto its associated torus, as in the figures below. In these figures, the initial point is taken to be , i.e. on the Clifford torus. In Fig. 1, two simple rotation trajectories are shown in black, while a left and a right isoclinic trajectory is shown in red and blue respectively. In Fig. 2, a general rotation in which and is shown, while in Fig. 3, a general rotation in which and is shown.\n\nFour-dimensional rotations can be derived from Rodrigues' rotation formula and the Cayley formula. Let be a 4 × 4 skew-symmetric matrix. The skew-symmetric matrix can be uniquely decomposed as\ninto two skew-symmetric matrices and satisfying the properties , and , where and are the eigenvalues of . Then, the 4D rotation matrices can be obtained from the skew-symmetric matrices and by Rodrigues' rotation formula and the Cayley formula.\n\nLet be a 4 × 4 nonzero skew-symmetric matrix with the set of eigenvalues\nThen can be decomposed as\nwhere and are skew-symmetric matrices satisfying the properties\n\nMoreover, the skew-symmetric matrices and are uniquely obtained as\n"}

He was a federal deputy for the State of Rio de Janeiro from 1995 to 2011.\n\nHe is best known for his book \"O que é isso, companheiro?\" (literally \"What is this, comrade?\") written in 1979. The book tells of the armed resistance to the military dictatorship in Brazil, and particularly describes the 1969 episode of the kidnapping of the American ambassador Charles Burke Elbrick, in which Gabeira took part as a member of MR8, a group trying to fight the military dictatorship installed in Brazil five years prior. \n\nThe book was made into a movie in 1997, titled \"Four Days in September\" in English. The movie was nominated for many awards, including an Oscar at the Best Foreign Language Film at the 70th Academy Awards. \n\nBecause of his role in the kidnapping of the ambassador Charles Burke Elbrick, Gabeira cannot enter the United States and its territories. Gabeira has asked for a visa revision three times, and was denied each time. In a May 2009 interview with Ragga magazine, Gabeira said \"I was in error\" in kidnapping the American ambassador in 1969 and that he would never participate in anti-American activity now. \n\nFernando Gabeira was one of the founding members of the Green Party of Brazil, but left the group in 2002 to join the Workers' Party. He became known for his positions sometimes considered controversial on certain societal subjects, such as the professionalization of prostitution, same-sex marriage and the legalization of cannabis.\n\nRecently he rejoined the Greens, due to his disappointment with Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's government, and also because of the way the Worker's Party was dealing with its remaining far-left members.During his exile in the 1970s, Gabeira lived in several countries including Chile, Sweden and Italy. In Stockholm, where he spent most of his exile, he studied anthropology at Stockholm University and worked as a journalist as well as a metro conductor He returned to Brazil in 1979, where he began to act as a journalist and writer, defending the end of the military regime.\n\nAfter 1985, Fernando Gabeira started to support the causes of minority rights and the environment.\n\nGabeira has repeatedly voiced his ideological support for the legalization of marijuana, for equal marriage laws and for the legalization of abortion. He ran for the mayoral office of Rio de Janeiro in 2008, and was defeated by Eduardo Paes in the runoff round on October 26 (49.3% – 50.7%). He also lost a bid to become Governor of Rio de Janeiro in 2010.\n\nGabeira is a cousin of Leda Nagle, a well-known Brazilian TV hostess. He lived for a decade in exile from Brazil during the military dictatorship, and returned to his country in 1979. Just after his return, a photo of Gabeira wearing a very small knitted swimsuit on Ipanema beach turned into a national scandal. Many years later, Gabeira revealed that his scandalous bathing suit was indeed the bottom part of one of Leda Nagle's bikinis.\n\nIn 1979, he wrote the book \"What is it, mate?\", about his participation in the armed struggle against the military regime in Brazil (1964–1985) and his subsequent exile in Europe. The book won the Jabuti Literature Prize in the biography and (or) memories category in 1980 and was made into the film Four Days in September by filmmaker Bruno Barreto in 1997.\n\nIn 1980, he released \"The Twilight of the Male\", a continuation of \"What is it, mate?\" .\n\nIn 1981, he launched \"Entradas e Bandeiras\" , a book in which he chronicles his return to Brazil and his abandonment of Marxist ideology, starting to fight for issues such as ecology, pleasure and sexual freedom. In the same year, he launched \"Hôte da utopia\", in which he deepens his new ideological positioning.\n\nIn 1982, he launched \"Sinais de vida on Planeta Minas\", in which he tells the feminist struggles against the conservative society of the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais , through the biographies of five women from Minas Gerais. Among them, Dona Beja and Ângela Diniz .\n\nIn \"Goiânia, 57th street - the nuclear plant in the land of the sun\", launched in 1987, Gabeira narrated the radiological accident that occurred in Goiânia in September of that year. \n\nIn 2000, he launched the book \"Marijuana\" , in which he discusses the decriminalization of its use, its therapeutic functions, the social role it plays etc.  .\n\nIn 2006, he launched the book \"Navigation in the fog\" , under a Creative Commons license, dealing with the Leech Scandal in 2005. \n\nIn 2012, he released the book \"Onde Está Tudo Aquilo Agora\" .\n\nIn 2017, he released the book \"Tropical Democracy: An Apprentice's Notebook\", in which he recounts the events of Dilma Roussef 's impeachment, as well as an overview of the last thirty years of Brazilian democracy.\n\nGabeira is the son of Paulo Gabeira and Isabel Nagle, both Lebanese immigrants. His surname was aportuguesado from the transliterations \"Jabara\" or \"Gebara\" (in Arabic : جبارة )‎).\n\nHe was married to Brazilian fashion designer, Yame Reis, with whom he had two daughters, Tami and Maya. The couple divorced in 1999. \n\nHis daughter Maya has since become a top female big wave surfer. She said the trauma of her parents' divorce drove her to leave home at age 15 and go to Australia on a student program. She moved to Hawaii in 2004 at age 17 to surf world class waves. She quickly emerged as the world's top female big-wave surfer, winning global championships surfing challenging spots like Mavericks, Waimea, Todos Santos, and South Africa's shark-infested \"Dungeons\". She told \"Huck Magazine\" in 2007: \"My dad and I are very similar. All the energy he's put into improving the country I have as well – only I've been channeling it into my surfing.\" She added: \"My dad has a really strong character, is incredibly bright and I’ve learned a lot from him.\"\n\n"}

It was published in 1985. It was the second book published by Gemmell, after \"Legend\", published a year earlier. The book is set in the same fictional world as \"Legend\", that of the Drenai, but is not a sequel in the usual sense as the events of the two books take place around a century apart. Thus the main protagonists of \"Legend\" are long since dead and play little part in \"The King Beyond the Gate\", other than passing mentions. This set a precedent for the entire Drenai series, in which very few characters appear in more than one novel, the gaps between novels sometimes running to centuries, giving a more epic, historical flavour to the series.\n\n\"The King Beyond the Gate\" takes place a century after \"Legend\" Druss The Legend is gone, the Earl of bronze a legend in himself. The Drenai are now under the rule of Ceska, a usurper of the throne who over time has become a mad power hungry emperor. Ceska rules with an iron fist, with the Joinings, and the Dark Templars as his tools of terror. The Joinings are horrifying werebeasts, made by the merging of man and animal, an ancient machine of the old times making the merging of two species possible, the result, a towering beast of such savagery that one alone becomes an army itself. The Dark Templars are priests of darkness, with power beyond that of normal men. Thus it falls to men of courage and those that choose the path of light to overthrow a tyrant--- Tenaka Khan and his companions must forge alliances and unlikely friendships to overcome a time of horror and turmoil.\n\nFollowing on from other Gemmell works where the main characters are powerful men past their prime, the three characters of Tenaka, Ananaïs and Decado are all three less able to rely on physical endurance and dumb luck, and instead use experience and bluff to survive. This story also offers a much grittier view of the Drenai world compared to Legend. The “Joinings” are new to the saga, melding of animals and men (and women).\n"}

After his death, she kept his embalmed heart, contained in a casket of ivory and silver, with her for the rest of her life, and it was buried alongside her when she died. In line with this devotion to her late husband, she named the abbey \"Dulce Cor\" (Latin for Sweet Heart). Their son, also John, became King of Scotland, but his reign was tragic and short.\n\nUnder the first abbot, Henry, the abbey was built in deep-red, local sandstone in the Early English style. It was founded as a daughter house to the nearby Dundrennan Abbey; thus this \"novum monasterium\" (new monastery) became known as the \"New Abbey \".\n\nOther abbots included - Henry, 1275; Eric, 1290; John, 1300; Thomas, 1400; William, 1470; Robert, 1503; John, 1539; Gilbert, 1565-1612.\n\nThe immediate abbey precincts extended to and sections of the surrounding wall can still be seen today. The abbey church, dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, in common with all Cistercian monasteries, measures , and the central tower rose to a height of .\n\nThe Abbot of Sweetheart was a member of the First Estate and sat \"ex officio\" in the Parliament. The Cistercian Order—whose members were commonly known as the White Monks because of the white cowl which they wear over their religious habit—built many great abbeys after their establishment around 1100. Like many of their abbeys, the New Abbey's interests lay not only in prayer and contemplation but in the farming and commercial activity of the area, making it the centre of local life.\n\nDuring the First War of Scottish Independence, King Edward I of England himself resided at the abbey in 1300, while campaigning in Galloway. After 50 years of warfare in the region, however, the abbey was left in a dilapidated state. The Bishop of Galloway bemoaned Sweetheart’s \"outstanding and notorious poverty\". Archibald Douglas, 3rd Earl of Douglas (1328-1400), often referred to as Archibald the Grim, became a major benefactor of the abbey and financed wholesale repairs and the rebuilding of the abbey complex. The depredations suffered by the abbey in subsequent periods, however, caused the graves of the foundress and her husband to be lost.\n\nThe abbey continued in quiet obscurity until it was eventually suppressed in the Scottish Reformation.\n\nStarting in 1565, the Scottish crown placed the abbey under a series of commendatory abbots. The last Cistercian abbot was Gilbert Broun, S.O.Cist. (died 1612), who continued to uphold the Catholic faith long after the Reformation. He was charged several times with enticing to \"papistrie\" from 1578 to 1605, until finally he was arrested in 1605, in spite of the resistance of the whole countryside, and transported to Edinburgh, where he was tried and sentenced to exile. In 1624, the last of the monks died and the abbey buildings and land passed into the hands of Sir Robert Spottiswoode, son of the Archbishop of St Andrews, who assumed the title of Lord of New Abbey.\n\nWhen, in 1633, King Charles I established the Diocese of Edinburgh, he pleaded with Spottiswoode to relinquish the lands of New Abbey, which he wanted to grant to the new diocese. Though Spottiswoode agreed, he was not paid for the lands, and when the royal grant to the diocese was cancelled, the king restored the estate back to Spottiswoode in 1641. He was soon forced into exile, however, so the estate continued in possession of the Crown.\n\n\nThe village which stands next to the ruins today, is now known as New Abbey. At the other end of the main street is Monksmill, a corn mill. Although the present buildings date from the late 18th century, there was an earlier mill built by and for the monks of the abbey which serviced the surrounding farms.\nThe abbey ruins dominate the skyline today and one can only imagine how it and the monks would have dominated early medieval life as farmers, agriculturalists, horse and cattle breeders. Surrounded by rich and fertile grazing and arable land, they became increasingly expert and systematic in their farming and breeding methods. Like all Cistercian abbeys, they made their mark, not only on the religious life of the district but on the ways of local farmers and influenced agriculture in the surrounding areas.\n\nA 14th century prayer book known as The Sweetheart Abbey Breviary is now in the National Library of Scotland in Edinburgh.\n\n"}

Set in a universe filled with bio-mechanical beings allied with classical element-themed tribes, the story follows two friends from the fire-based village of Ta-Koro on a quest to find the owner of the Mask of Light, a mystical artifact that can potentially defeat Makuta, an evil entity threatening the island. The story is based on the latter half of the toyline's 2003 narrative.\n\nThe project was first proposed in 2001, during the original run of the Bionicle toyline. Lego contacted multiple writers for the project, including original Bionicle contributors Bob Thompson and Alastair Swinnerton, and Hollywood writers Henry Gilroy and Greg Weisman. Production began in 2002, taking approximately a year to complete. A major part of the graphical design was adjusting the characters so they could work in human-like ways while still resembling the original toys. The music was composed by Nathan Furst, who used orchestral and tribal elements to create the score. Voice casting was handled by Kris Zimmerman, and the voicework was done with the setting and mythos of Bionicle in mind.\n\nMultiple studios were involved in the development and distribution of \"Mask of Light\": it was co-produced by Lego and Create TV & Film, developed by Creative Capers Entertainment and CGCG, and post-production was handled 310 Studios and Hacienda Post. It was released in September 2003 on home video and DVD, distributed by Miramax Home Entertainment and Buena Vista Home Entertainment. Upon release, the film reached high positions in VHS and DVD charts, and received generally positive reviews from journalists. \"Mask of Light\" was followed by two prequel films, \"\" (2004) and \"\" (2005), and a stand-alone sequel \"\" (2009).\n\n\"The Mask of Light\" takes place on a tropical island in the Bionicle universe. According to legend, the Great Spirit Mata Nui created the island's masked Matoran inhabitants. Mata Nui was sent into a coma by his envious spirit brother Makuta, who began a reign of terror on the island. His reign ended when six guardians, known as Toa, freed the island from his regime. The Matoran, alongside the Toa and Turaga leaders, live in Element-themed regions of the island. The events of \"The Mask of Light\" take place during the latter half of the 2003 storyline.\n\nThe film starts when two Matoran from the fire village of Ta-Koro called Jaller and Takua discover a Great Kanohi, a Toa mask imbued with Elemental power. The two Matoran then participate in a multi-tribal game of Kohlii, the island's national sport: the match reveals developing tensions between the Fire Toa Tahu and the Water Toa Gali. At the end of the match, the Mask is accidentally revealed and the Turaga recognize its powers. They announce that it heralds the arrival of a seventh Toa destined to defeat Makuta and awaken Mata Nui. Jaller and Takua are sent on a quest to find the Seventh Toa, guided by the Mask. In the meantime, Makuta sends three of his Rahkshi \"sons\" to retrieve the Mask. During an attack on Ta-Koro which destroys the village, Tahu is poisoned, causing him to become increasingly erratic and worsening his already-strained relationship with Gali.\n\nDuring their journey together, Jaller and Takua receive aid from the Air Toa Lewa, and the Ice Toa Kopaka, the latter of whom temporarily immobilizes the Rakhshi by trapping them in a frozen lake. After this, Takua is threatened by Makuta, and abandons Jaller in an attempt to shield him. Makuta then releases three more Rakhshi, who attack the Earth village of Onu-Koro as Takua arrives. Tahu, Kopaka, Lewa and Gali arrive to help the Earth Toa Onua and the Stone Toa Pohatu: during the battle, Tahu is further corrupted and goes insane, forcing the Toa to capture him and flee. Takua decides to rejoin Jaller, while Gali and the other Toa purge the Rakhshi poison from Tahu, resulting in his reconciliation with Gali.\n\nArriving at Kini Nui, a great temple at the island's centre, Jaller and Takua are confronted by all six Rahkshi. The six Toa mount a united offensive and defeat five of them, but a surviving Rahkshi attacks Takua. Jaller sacrifices himself to protect Takua, and Jaller's final words prompt Takua to don the Mask of Light: the Mask transforms him into Takanuva, the Toa of Light. Defeating the final Rakhshi, he constructs a craft powered by the worm-like creatures inside the Rahkshi to guide him to Makuta. Traveling to his lair beneath Mata Nui, the two hold a Kohlii contest for the island's fate. At Takanuva's bidding, the Toa, Turaga and Matoran gather together in the chamber, and witness Takanuva merging with Makuta to form a single powerful being. With Takanuva's willpower dominant, the being raises a gate leading deeper beneath the island, through which the gathered people flee. The being also revives Jaller before the gate collapses on top of it. The Turaga proceed to awaken Mata Nui using the Mask of Light, which in turn revives Takanuva. The film ends with Takanuva discovering , the Matoran's original home.\n\n\nThe concept for a movie based on the Bionicle toyline was proposed as early as 2001, when Bionicle became an unexpected commercial success for Lego: this idea was originally inspired by the fact that Lego advertised Bionicle as if it were a movie, and they had received inquiry emails and licensing requests from multiple film studios. Deciding to make the movie while retaining full creative control, Lego began discussing with potential partners, knowing that the film needed to come out while Bionicle was still looming large in the public consciousness. Lego's eventual partner was production entity Create TV & Film. With the initial partnership set up, Lego created some development assets and went round various animation studios to find one that would develop the film. They narrowed it down to two studios, one of which was Creative Capers Entertainment. Creative Capers convinced Lego to employ them after producing a well-received short animated segment featuring Lewa. Creative Caper's three principles, directors Terry Shakespeare and David Molina, and producer Sue Shakespear, all took up their respective roles for the film's production. The deal was reportedly worth $5 million. In a later interview, Shakespeare referred to the film's aesthetic as \"primary colors that were coded to the areas\", saying it had a \"younger feel\" when compared to its prequel. He also referred to the film as \"very intimate, very organic\".\n\nThe film began full production in 2002. While most projects of its type took 18–24 months to complete, the development team completed the film in 13 months. The project's budget was later estimated as being between $3.5 to $5 million. In addition to Creative Capers, Taiwanese studio CGCG created most of the animation: at the time, overseas outsourcing was a rarity for CGI movies. By the end of production, the film ran to 77 minutes of raw footage. At this stage, 310 Studios was brought in to handle post production, which mostly entailed cutting the film's length down by 7 minutes. According to 310 Studios president Billy Jones, the hardest part of this was deciding which pieces needed to be cut, as they were impressed with everything that had been produced. 310 Studios also created the opening title and ending credit sequences. Lego also partnered with Miramax to distribute the film, along with developing a future full feature-length theatrical film.\n\nFive different people were involved in the creation of the film's story and script: executive producer Bob Thompson, original Bionicle co-creators and writers Alastair Swinnerton and Martin Riber Andersen, and Hollywood writers Henry Gilroy and Greg Weisman. The script-writing process began in 2002. Gilroy became involved after a meeting with Thompson, and enjoyed working on the script as he greatly admired the Bionicle mythos. Two draft scripts were originally created to see who would write the better script: one by Swinnerton, and one from Gilroy. Due to time constraints, the Gilroy script was accepted with some of Swinnerton's ideas included. Gilroy's most difficult task was creating the dialogue for the Toa: he needed to take into account Thompson's own interpretations, and what the majority of fans thought they should sounds like. In the end, he attempted to stay true to original portrayals while giving the voice actors something unique to work with. He also needed to balance their portrayals and screentime, as each of the six needed a chance to shine. The script went through eight different drafts before the final version, although this was far less than Gilroy was used to seeing on other projects. During planning stages, a lot of time was devoted to how characters interacted with each other: cited examples were Lewa's style of speaking, and Kopaka's stoic behaviour. These traits were accentuated for the film to give the characters more distinction and depth. He also needed to avoid putting in out-of-context pop culture references, which would not fit into the setting of Bionicle. As part of the world and character development, expressions and exclamations unique to the world were created: a cited example is Jaller saying \"You could have been Lava-Bones\" when Takua narrowly escapes being killed by a flood of lava.\n\nThe characters of Bionicle had been portrayed in various ways across multiple media, including the official comics, Flash animations used for online videos, and CGI commercials for the sets. The team decided to use the models from the CGI commercials as their working base for the film models. Before commencing with designing the characters, the team went to Lego's Denmark headquarters and received lessons in the Bionicle design process. The team were originally not going to alter the characters that much, but they needed them to be emotive, which necessitated a redesign. The first step in creating the character models was redrawing the skeleton, then adding muscle pods that would interweave with the skeleton: the muscle gave the characters a more textured appearance, and were added to the shoulders, calves, abdomen and chest cavity. Each character was given a \"heart light\", a pulsating light in their chest which would fluctuate even when the character was stationary in-shot. They also adjusted the eyes, making the sockets shallower than on the sets and giving them a pupil-like glow. While redesigning the Toa, the team consulted with the original Lego staff to determine what materials the characters were made of: the muscles were compared to rubber, the bones described as a mesh of titanium alloy and carbon fibre, while the armour was made of Kevlar. In general, the outer shells remained mostly unchanged from the sets, although the visible gears were removed and armour was fitted to their backs. The Toa were also bulked up a little when compared to their sets so their feats would be believable for viewers.\n\nSeveral external features were redesigned for the movie, including the introduction of a movable mouth to allow for a more human character, and a four-pronged mechanical tongue to make them look less like dolls. Other characters used lights behind their masks to form mouth movement. Particular emphasis was placed on the eyebrows and lips of characters. The main change from the original models was the inclusion of hands, which was a necessity if the character performances were to be made realistic. Custom texture maps were created for each character so they would appear unique. In addition to reinventing old characters, the team created original character designs with Lego staff. Makuta, who had only been briefly glimpsed in the comics and web animations, was created through a \"Frankenstein principle\", taking parts and pieces from multiple Bionicle sets to create the ultimate Bionicle villain. Other original creations included Takua's pet crab Pewku, and a Gukko Bird designed to transport two Matoran. The Rahkshi are described by Bob Thompson as \"like hounds hunting down the [Mask of Light]\". They were created by Swinnerton, and comic writer Alan Grant helped develop their characters. They were designed to appear more machine-like than the rest of the cast, and their design were strongly inspired by the bio-mechanical artworks of H. R. Giger.\n\nVoice casting was managed by Kris Zimmerman, who chose voice actors that seemed to suit certain roles: the Matoran were voiced by young adults, while the Turaga were voiced by older actors. The voice actors and their performances were chosen so they would not sound like they came from a specific area of the world, instead sound like they came from and belonged in the Bionicle universe. A notable event during recording was a behind-the-scenes incident between Michas and Francis: originally cast in the respective roles of Jaller and Takua, Michas came into a recording session in a muddled state and began reading Takua's lines by mistake. When Francis came in, he read Jaller's lines: when the staff heard them and were favourably impressed, the actors permanently switched roles. Voice acting for the project was mostly done in 2002, but dialogue was re-recorded during Additional Dialogue Recording (ADR) into 2003: approximately 30% of the final film's dialogue was done during ADR. Audio and music post-production was handled by Hacienda Post. The company's president Tim Borquez served as sound supervisor. \"Mask of Light\" was the first time in any media that Bionicle characters spoke.\n\nThe music was composed by Nathan Furst, whose preferred composition style of grand orchestra and electronica was what the film's producers were looking for. Initially ignorant of the Bionicle universe, he explored the official website after getting the job as composer to get better context for his music. This and discussions he had with staff helped in the creation of eight or nine specific themes. The overall style is grand orchestral, but includes elements of electronic and tribal music. Furst used elements of African, Polynesian, and Eastern European music to communicate the fact that Mata Nui was an island, and when he could he incorporated his music into the action rather than leaving it as a standalone element within scenes.\n\nOriginally unavailable for purchase as a soundtrack, Furst published the score of \"Mask of Light\" as a digital album with Rising Phoenix Records in 2017, fourteen years after the film's release. The album, titled \"Bionicle: Mask of Light Original Score Soundtrack (14th Anniversary Release)\", was published on March 10, 2017. It is fully remastered and contains the complete score as heard in the film, consisting of eighteen tracks which comprise approximately an hour of music.\n\n\n\"Mask of Light\" was first announced in April 2002 for release in September the following year. It was Lego Media's (later becoming Create TV & Film in early 2003) first project based on original characters and storylines, and their first direct-to-video production. It initially released on 16 September 2003 for home video and DVD. It went on to release in 27 different countries over the next eight weeks. It was released under the Miramax Home Entertainment label through Buena Vista Home Entertainment. Prior to its release, the film received a world premiere at Legoland in Carlsbad, California on 13 September: the premiere featured a huge mosaic built of Lego and a special effects show, in addition to special guests and costumed characters. The following year, the film received its television premiere on Cartoon Network's Toonami program block.\n\nAt release, the film ranked high in multiple sales charts. In the \"Top Kid Video\" compiled by \"Billboard\", it came close to the top of the charts upon release. Upon release, the film ranked at #2 on Amazon.com's VHS best seller list, coming in behind the VHS release of \"\". According to Lego's 2003 financial report, the game was top-selling VHS release in the United States in its first week, and ranked at #4 in a similar list compiled by \"The Hollywood Reporter\". It was also among the top premiere DVDs of the year. The game's rental sales were also high, being placed at #8 in the animated direct-to-video charts and totalling $4.24 million revenue by October 2004. According to \"Animation Magazine\", the film is considered to be a commercial success.\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a favourable ranking of \"B+\", calling it a \"well-constructed CGI adventure\" and saying that those who did not understand the story would enjoy the effects and action sequences. DVDTalk's Don Houston was generally positive about both the film and its additional content: he called the visuals \"exceptionally crisp and clear\" when compared to other films of its type, and gave high praise to the voice acting and noting darker themes within the film. His main criticism was that it relied heavily on foreknowledge of earlier Bionicle storylines. Sci Film.org praised the film's design and visuals, but felt that the film was too short, echoed Houston's criticism of a need for foreknowledge, and said that it was \"too respectful\" when compared to other films like \"\". Jules Faber of Digital Views Daily said the story had been designed with children in mind, and again praised the visuals despite seeing some stilted animations and poorly-done environmental effects. He was generally positive about the DVD's audio and visual quality. Both Houston and Faber noted homages to other well-known films, including \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", and the works of Ray Harryhausen.\n\n\"Mask of Light\" won a Golden Reel Award for Best Visual Effects in a DVD Premiere Movie in December 2003. In addition, it won the Best DVD release award at the 2004 Saturn Awards. In 2014, Vulture.com made mention of the movie in a 2014 retrospective on Lego's history in the movie industry. That same year, \"Radio Times\" ranked it as among the best movies based on toys, say that the developers \"did a better-than-average job of translating the appeal of the toys to screen\".\n\n\"Mask of Light\" was promoted by Lego with new toys based on the film's characters, a video game based on its story that released in 2003, and a novelisation of the film. Two further Bionicle movies were confirmed prior to the release of \"Mask of Light\", with the second being another direct-to-video feature and a third for theatrical release. The second movie, \"\", released in 2004. The third movie, \"\", was released as a direct-to-DVD feature in 2005. Both films were produced by the same creative team behind \"Mask of Light\". A fourth film by a different studio, \"\", was released in 2009 through Universal Pictures Home Entertainment. A four-episode television series based on the rebooted Bionicle toyline aired in the first quarter of 2016 on Netflix.\n\n"}

WUSL broadcasts from a class B signal with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 27,000 watts from a tower located in the Roxborough section of Philadelphia, and its studios are located in Bala Cynwyd.\n\nIn 1961, the 98.9 frequency signed on as WPBS \"\"We're Philadelphia's Bulletin Station\"\", under common ownership with the city's largest daily newspaper at the time, \"The Evening Bulletin\" (pre-dating the 1969 existence of television's Public Broadcasting Service). The station was cross-promoted with the newspaper and featured an easy listening format. At one point, WPBS was called \"Velvet Stereo\".\n\nIn 1976, the newspaper sold the station to LIN Broadcasting, which at the time also owned WFIL 560. WPBS changed calls to WUSL, which stood for \"US-1\", and Program Director Jim Nettleton instituted a Soft Adult Contemporary format mixed with standards which had crossed over to the 1960s/1970s pop charts (e.g. Engelbert Humperdinck, Barbra Streisand, etc.)\n\nOn July 3, 1981, the station switched to a \"3-in-a-row\" country music format as \"Continuous Country, US-99FM\". Two months later, co-owned WFIL switched to a more personality and information-leaning country station. WUSL signed off the country format in the early hours of October 9, 1982, to become a CHR/Urban Contemporary a.k.a. CHUrban station as \"The All New Kiss 99FM\". At this time, LIN Broadcasting was the owner of WUSL.\n\nWUSL branded as \"99FM\" for a few weeks until late October 1982, when it rebranded as \"The New Power 99fm\". Within months, the station had surpassed WDAS-FM in the ratings. Stations around the country adopted the \"Power\" brand (but not always with an Urban, CHUrban or CHR format). WUSL continues to be the dominant urban leader in Philadelphia today.\n\nIn 1982, the station began presenting its annual major concert event, \"PowerHouse.\"\n\nEZ Communications, owner of rival WIOQ, purchased WUSL in July 1994.\n\nIn February 1997, EZ Communications was attempting to merge with American Radio Systems of Boston, and exchanged its Philadelphia stations, WIOQ and WUSL, plus $10 million, for Evergreen's four FM and two AM stations in Charlotte: WPEG, WBAV (AM/FM), WNKS, WRFX and WFNZ. After the merger, WUSL focused its programming on a younger audience while WDAS served an older demographic.\n\nOne of the most well-known programs to air on WUSL was a morning zoo-style show called \"The Carter & Sanborn Morning Show\" (or \"Carter & Sanborn in the Morning\"), which was hosted by Brian Carter and Dave Sanborn. The show featured a cast of off-beat characters, all voiced by Sanborn, including wise-cracking horoscope reader \"Horace, the Taurus\" and fall down drunk blues singer \"Lunchmeat Mumford\". During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the show was a main draw in Philadelphia among younger members of all demographics. Bill Simpson, who would later host a nighttime show on both incarnations of WJJZ (first at 106.1 and later at 97.5), used the alias Dave Sanborn on the show, which often created confusion with the well-known jazz saxophonist David Sanborn, especially among those who were not regular listeners. The show was briefly revived in 2005 on WDAS after that station dropped Tom Joyner from its schedule.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1998, Power 99 aired the groundbreaking hip hop show \"Radioactive\", hosted by Colby Colb. Also on the show were DJ Ran, DJ Cosmic Kev and Robert \"Laid Back\" Black. Colby Colb started as an intern at the station and following the success of Radioactive went on to host nights (6–10pm), mornings with Wendy Williams and Dee Lee (The Dream Team). The Dream Team would become one of the biggest urban morning shows in the country competing closely with market leader Howard Stern who was on WYSP at the time. Their success was short lived as Wendy Williams left in August of 2001 to go back to New York City to do afternoons on WBLS. Colb would leave WUSL 6 months later in March of 2002 to help launch WWPR (Power 1051) in New York City. From 2002 until 2011, WUSL had been the only urban contemporary station in Philadelphia, when Radio One's WPHI-FM switched formats to urban contemporary from rhythmic contemporary again. Former Power 99 host Colby Colb would become the Program Director of WPHI as they battled WUSL in the early/mid 2000s in one of the most heated radio battles in the country.\n\nWUSL was also the home of the controversial Star and Buc Wild Morning Show from late 2005 to May 2006. It was also the home of Miss Jones in the Morning, Shamara – \"The Midday Princess\" and The POWER 99FM's Hot Boyz with Poochman, Mikey Dredd and Uncle O at night.\n\nThe 2013 on air line up consisted of \"The Rise N Grind Morning Show\" with Mina SayWhat (former DJ of Sirius/XM's The Heat), and Mikey Dredd (former member of the Hot Boyz). SayWhat left the station in December 2017.\n\nWUSL has won numerous awards for its news and public affairs programming, a hallmark of which was their Sunday morning programming. From its inception as Power 99, Sunday morning was dedicated to two public affairs shows: \"Sunday Morning Live\", hosted by longtime news anchor Loraine Ballard Morrill and later \"Empower Half Hour\" with Lehronda Upshur. Morrill and Upshur continue to host shows and broadcast news and traffic on other iHeartMedia stations (WDAS, WISX and WIOQ) as programming changes have forced public affairs shows from Power 99 to those other stations.\n\nThe station was one of 10 awarded the 2007 Crystal Radio Award for public service awarded by the National Association of Broadcasters. Winners were honored at the Radio Luncheon on April 17, 2007, during the NAB Show in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n\nWUSL is short-spaced to WAWZ (licensed to serve Zarephath, New Jersey as they operate on first adjacent channels (98.9 and 99.1) and the transmitters they are broadcast on are only 53 miles apart. The minimum distance between two Class B stations operating on first adjacent channels according to current FCC rules is 105 miles.\n\n"}
{"id": "2307936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2307936", "title": "Spectacular Bid", "text": "Spectacular Bid\n\nSpectacular Bid (February 17, 1976 – June 9, 2003) was an American Thoroughbred race horse. In a racing career which lasted from 1978 through 1980, Spectacular Bid won 26 of 30 races, set several track records and earned US$2,781,607, a then-record sum. He won Eclipse Awards in each of his three seasons.\n\nSpectacular Bid was the leading American two-year-old of 1978, when his wins included Champagne Stakes and the Laurel Futurity. In early 1979 his wins included the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes as he built up a run of twelve consecutive victories. Spectacular Bid's attempt at winning the Triple Crown failed as he sustained a controversial defeat in the Belmont Stakes. He recovered from injury to win the Marlboro Cup and confirm his status as the best American colt of his generation. In 1980, racing as a four-year-old, Spectacular Bid was undefeated in nine races and was named American Horse of the Year.\n\nAt the end of the 1980 season, Spectacular Bid was retired to stud, where his record as a sire of winners was mixed.\n\nSpectacular Bid was bred at Buck Pond Farm near Lexington, Kentucky by Madelyn Jason and her mother, Mrs. William Gilmore. He was a very dark gray (described as \"steel-gray\" and \"battleship-colored\") during his racing career although, like all grays, his coat lightened as he aged, and he eventually took on a \"flea-bitten gray\" appearance.\n\nHis sire was Bold Bidder, stakes winner of 13 races who also sired the 1974 Kentucky Derby winner, Cannonade. His grandsire was Bold Ruler, a U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee and an eight-time Leading sire in North America. His dam was the gray mare Spectacular by Promised Land, who, as a descendant of the broodmare Fly By Night, was a member of the same branch of Thoroughbred Family 2-d which also produced the Kentucky Derby winners Northern Dancer and Cannonade. Spectacular Bid was inbred 3x3 to the stallion To Market, meaning that this horse appears twice in the third generation of his pedigree. As of 2012 he remains one of the two most inbred Kentucky Derby winners in the last 50 years (Big Brown was similarly inbred to Northern Dancer).\n\nAs a yearling, Spectacular Bid was sold at auction for US$37,000 (equivalent to $ in ) at the 1977 Keeneland September yearling sale to Harry and Teresa Meyerhoff of Hawksworth Farm, on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. The colt was sent into training with Grover G. \"Bud\" Delp, who remained his trainer throughout his career.\n\nSpectacular Bid began his racing career on June 30, 1978 at Pimlico Race Course, where he came within 2/5ths of a second of the track record for 5 1/2 furlongs. Three weeks later at his next start at Pimlico, an allowance race, he equalled the track record of 1:04.2. He notched stakes victories in the Grade III World's Playground Stakes, the Grade I Champagne Stakes, the Young America Stakes, the Grade I Laurel Futurity (in which he set a track record, a rarity for a two-year-old in a route race, running 1 miles in 1:41.6), and the Heritage Stakes. He also finished second in the Dover Stakes and had his only out-of-the-money finish in the Tyro Stakes. Spectacular Bid's regular jockey was the teenager Ronnie Franklin.\n\nBy the end of his first year of racing, Spectacular Bid had won seven races in nine starts, set one track record and tied another, won US$384,484 and been unanimously voted the Eclipse champion two-year-old colt for the year.\n\nSpectacular Bid's second year of racing began where his first left off, as he reeled off five wins in rapid succession: the Hutcheson Stakes, the Fountain of Youth, the Florida Derby (all at Gulfstream Park), the Flamingo Stakes (at Hialeah), and the Blue Grass Stakes (at Keeneland Race Course). After the Florida Derby, which Spectacular Bid won by 4½ lengths despite meeting trouble in running, Delp reprimanded Franklin in public over his ride: \"You idiot! You nearly killed that horse!\". Franklin defended himself by claiming that the other riders had colluded to stop Spectacular Bid obtaining a clear run.\n\nSpectacular Bid's attempt at the Triple Crown began with the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs in May 1979. The crowd of 125,000 made him the 3/5 favorite, with California champion Flying Paster the bettors' second choice. Spectacular Bid seemed nervous before the start, but Delp was so confident of victory that as the horse paraded in front of the fans, he called, \"Go bet! Go bet!\" Spectacular Bid was restrained by Franklin in the early stages before moving up on the outside to take the lead on the far turn. He drew clear in the straight and won by 2¾ lengths over General Assembly, with Golden Act in third. After suffering a leg cut during the race, Flying Paster finished fifth. Spectacular Bid was the last two-year-old champion to win the Kentucky Derby until Street Sense in 2007.\n\nSpectacular Bid's next step in the quest for the Triple Crown came at the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico. Bumped early, he ran wide and by the final stretch was in command. He handily won the race, outpacing his competitors to win by 5½ lengths from Golden Act, with nine lengths back to Screen King in third. His time of 1:54.2 was faster than that of Seattle Slew or Affirmed, and by official time faster than Secretariat (though Secretariat's time in this race was disputed and in 2012 changed to 1:53.0). When asked about the colt's prospects of winning the Triple Crown in the Belmont Stakes, Franklin claimed that \"we're a cinch.\"\n\nOn the morning of the Belmont Stakes, a freak accident was discovered: Spectacular Bid had stepped on a safety pin. The pin had become embedded in his hoof, later leading to an infection that required the hoof to be drilled to cure the problem. However, after the discovery of the injury, Spectacular Bid did not seem lame and was entered into the race. Three days prior to the race, Franklin was fined after he engaged in a fist fight with Angel Cordero, Jr. in the jockeys' preparation room due to a dispute over an earlier race at Belmont. In the Belmont, Franklin rode Spectacular Bid aggressively early in the mile and a half race and went to the lead before half way. Spectacular Bid held a clear lead entering the stretch but began to struggle and was overtaken by Coastal, who challenged along the inside rail. The favorite faded in the closing stages and lost second place to Golden Act near the finish. Some commentators speculated that Delp and Franklin had been intent on emulating Secretariat's performance in 1973 and that their tactics were intended to maximize the margin of victory. Delp, who had commented dismissively on Coastal's chances before the race, offered few excuses: \"[Spectacular Bid] may not be a mile-and-a-half horse. The best horse won. I got beat, that's all. Tomorrow's another day.\" Franklin, who was replaced by Bill Shoemaker in Spectacular Bid's subsequent races, admitted that he had ridden a poorly judged race, explaining that he had very little experience of race-riding over long distances.\n\nSpectacular Bid's failure to win the Belmont began a record-breaking drought: after Affirmed in 1978, no horse would complete the Triple Crown until American Pharoah achieved the feat in 2015. Spectacular Bid and American Pharoah are also the last two 2-year-old champions to run in the Belmont with Triple Crowns on the line.\n\nFollowing the Belmont Stakes, Spectacular Bid took two months off to recover from the injury. He returned to racing with Hall of Fame jockey Bill Shoemaker, who rode him through most of the remainder of his career. His first race back was in August 1979 in an allowance race at Delaware Park. He won by more than 17 lengths and set a new track record for 1 miles, 1:41.6. Spectacular Bid followed this performance with a win at the Marlboro Cup at Belmont Park, beating both horses he had lost to in the Belmont Stakes: Coastal and Golden Act. He was scheduled to race in the Marlboro against 1978 Triple Crown winner Affirmed, but Affirmed's owners bowed out of the race in reaction to a 133-pound impost assignment to Affirmed.\n\nSpectacular Bid did meet Affirmed in the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont in October, where he made repeated challenges and finished second to the Triple Crown winner. This was the last race Spectacular Bid lost, and the only time, apart from the Belmont, in which he raced over a mile and a half. He finished the year with one more race, the Meadowlands Cup, again setting a track record at 1 miles, 2:01.2. At the end of the year, he was unanimously awarded the title of Eclipse champion three-year-old colt for the year and was runner-up to Affirmed in the vote for Horse of the Year. His winnings for this year totalled US$1,279,333.\n\nAs a four-year-old, Spectacular Bid started in nine races, winning them all for earnings of US$1,117,790. He set five track records at distances of 7 furlongs, 1 mile, 1¼ miles, and twice at 1⅛ miles.\n\nHis first three races were part of the \"Strub Series\", all held at the Santa Anita Park course that the late Charles H. Strub owned and built. Spectacular Bid carried 126 pounds in each race and defeated Flying Paster each time. The first race in the series was the Grade II Malibu Stakes at 7 furlong. Spectacular Bid ran the distance in 1:20, which stood as a track record for 27 years until Santa Anita removed its dirt track in favor of an artificial surface. Then he won the Grade II San Fernando Stakes, and finally, he won the Grade I Strub Stakes at 1¼ miles, running the fastest 1¼ miles ever on a dirt track, 1:57.8, and breaking a 30-year-old record of 1:58.2 set by Hall of Famer Noor carrying under 130 pounds in 1950. As of 2018, Spectacular Bid's time still stands as the world record on a dirt track.\n\nSpectacular Bid also won the Grade I Santa Anita Handicap (carrying 130 lbs) on a sloppy track March 2. Then he moved to Hollywood Park Racetrack, where he won the Mervyn Leroy Handicap carrying 132 lbs on May 18 and the Grade I Californian Stakes, carrying 130 lbs in a track record time of 1:45.8. He then shipped to Arlington Park to win the Grade III Washington Park Handicap by ten lengths under 130 lbs. His time of 1:46.2 for 1⅛ miles broke the track record, which had been jointly held by Damascus. Then it was on to Monmouth Park for the Grade I Monmouth Handicap, which he won under 132 lbs, defeating champion filly Glorious Song. Delp caused some controversy by withdrawing Spectacular Bid from the Marlboro Cup after the horse was assigned a weight of 136 lbs.\n\nSpectacular Bid concluded his career with a walkover in the Woodward Stakes on September 20, 1980, at Belmont, covering the 1¼ miles in 2:02.4. A plan to race in the Jockey Club Gold Cup was aborted on the day of the race when an injury to the horse's left front ankle flared up. Delp thereafter announced Spectacular Bid's retirement.\n\nDuring his final year, Spectacular Bid compiled then-record earnings of US$2,781,607 and was named American Champion Older Male Horse and Horse of the Year. In the voting for the latter award, he received 181 of the 200 votes, beating Genuine Risk (14 votes), Temperence Hill (4) and John Henry (1).\n\nFollowing his last race, Spectacular Bid was syndicated for a then-record US$22 million and put to stud at Claiborne Farm in Kentucky, where his initial stud fee was US$150,000. He made a promising start to his breeding career, but his later record was disappointing. The quality of mares he attracted fell, and his stud fees declined over the years. He was eventually sold and moved in 1991 to Milfer Farms in Unadilla, New York, where he lived out the remainder of his years, continuing to attract visits and letters from admirers. He was never pensioned from stud duty, covering ten mares at a fee of $3,500 in the last year of his life.\n\nSpectacular Bid was sent to stud at Claiborne Farm, which is where Secretariat was also sent to stud. Secretariat's paddock at Claiborne Farm bordered three other stallions: Drone, Sir Ivor, and Spectacular Bid. Secretariat did not pay much attention to Drone or Sir Ivor, but he and Spectacular Bid became friendly and occasionally raced each other along the fence line between their paddocks.\n\nSpectacular Bid sired 253 winners, including 47 stakes winners that won more than US$19 million. His most notable progeny include: Bite the Bullet (19 starts 5-4-2 for US$216,809; sire of 19 SW in Australia), Spectacular Love (won G1 Belmont Futurity Stakes), Spectacular Sue, Maison Close, Lay Down, Festivity, Spectacular Joke, Princess Pietrina, Lotus Pool, Esprit d'Etoile, Legal Bid and Sweettuc. At the time of his death, his daughters had produced 69 stakes winners, including the European Champion Sprinter Mozart.\n\nSpectacular Bid died from a heart attack on June 9, 2003, and was buried at Milfer Farms. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living winner of the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes.\n\n\"The Blood-Horse\" magazine ranked Spectacular Bid at #10 in the Top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century. He was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1982. In their book \"A Century of Champions\", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris ranked him as the third best North American horse of the 20th century (behind Secretariat and Citation) and the ninth best in their global ranking.\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" quoted jockey Bill Shoemaker as saying that Spectacular Bid was the best horse he ever rode.\n\n\n"}

The band members included L. Mental (vocals), Daniel Benia (bass), Juan Campodónico (guitars), P.P. Canedo (drums), and Carlos Casacuberta. The group released two albums, \"El Peyote Asesino\" (Orfeo, 1995) and \"Terraja\" (Surco/Universal, 1998), the latter being produced by Gustavo Santaolalla. \"Terraja\" \nfirst received recognition for hit single \"Mal de la cabeza\".\nThe name El Peyote Asesino, comes from the hallucinogenic cactus the Huicholes (Mexican indigenous culture) used in their rituals.\n\nBy the time of their second presentation, at Big Bang, the group was complete. Pepe Canedo (drums) and Carlos Casacuberta (voice and guitar). After that show, they continued with many other shows in the underground scene of Montevideo. Unconventional sounds, Mexican slang and distorted guitars were always part of the band. The influence of the Beastie Boys was most notable in this band.\nIn 1994 they presented their first demo at the \"Generación 95\" contest sponsored by a national television network show (\"Rock de primera\") and a radio network ( X FM 100.3). With this demo they won the contest and as a prize they received the possibility of working on an album in a real recording studio, which was recorded between July and August of the following year.\n\nOn December 1995 their first album '’’El Peyote Asesino'’’ was launched (Orfeo). Gabriel Casacuberta (brother of Carlos Casacuberta) and Luis Restuccia were the ones in charge of the production of this album.\nThis album sold over a thousand copies, which made it the highest selling rock album in Uruguay, during the first months of 1996. Meanwhile, the group increased their live performances and started coming out of the Montevideo underground scene.\nOn January of 1996 the band filmed its first video '’’L. Mental'’’ which spread throughout most of the local TV stations.\n’'’El Peyote Asesino'’’ the most known track of the album, got a place in the top ten singles of X FM reaching the first spot in only 18 days.\n\nDuring the month of September the band starts recording their second album, \"Terraja\", in the Can Am Recorders studio, city of Los Angeles, California. Once they finished recording it, they went on tour with the Mexican Molotov and Control Machete, playing in many parts of Mexico.\n\"Terraja\" was finally edited in August 1998, in different countries such as Mexico, Argentina, Uruguay, Puerto Rico and the United States.\nThe band returned to Argentina, one month after the album was edited, to perform along with Molotov, Cypress Hill, Bersuit Vergarabat and Árbol. Later that month, they played in Uruguay for the last time along with Plátano Macho and Molotov, before they split up for several years.\n\nTen years after their split up, they performed live at the '’’Pilsen Rock'’’ festival \nand shortly after in the '’’Teatro de Verano'’’.\n\nIn 2016 they once again performed in the Teatro de Verano on the nights of the 12th and the 13th of may. Although Carlas Casacuberta wasn't able to play due to health problems. Guests Matias Rada filled on Casacuberta's role instead while Bruno Torterolla played the keyboard. \n"}

Abandoning this design after three years' trial, he returned home and began his literary career by contributing articles to a local journal, \"La Abeja montañesa\" in 1858. He also wrote much in a weekly paper, \"El Tío Cayetín\", and in 1864 he collected his powerful realistic sketches of local life and manners under the title of \"Escenas montañesas\" (\"Mountain scenes\").\n\nPereda fought against the revolution of 1868 in \"El Tío Cayetín\", writing the newspaper almost single-handed. In 1871 he was elected as the Carlist deputy for Cabuérniga. In this same year he published a second series of \"Escenas montañesas\" under the title of \"Tipos y paisajes\"; and in 1876 appeared \"Bocetos al temple\", three tales, in one of which the author describes his disenchanting political experiences.\n\nThe \"Tipos trashumantes\" belongs to the year 1877, as does \"El Buey suelto\", which was intended as a reply to the thesis of Balzac's work, \"Les Petites misères de la vie conjugale\". More and more pessimistic as to the political future of his country, Pereda took occasion in \"Don Gonzalo González de la Gonzalera\" (1879) to ridicule the Revolution as he had seen it at work, and to pour scorn upon the \"nouveaux riches\" who exploited Liberalism for their personal ends. Two novels by his friend Pérez Galdós, \"Doña Perfecta\" and \"Gloria\", drew from Pereda a reply, \"De Tal palo tal astilla\" (1880), in which he endeavours to show that tolerance in religious matters is disastrous alike to nations and to individuals. The \"Esbozos y rasguños\" (1881) is of lighter material, and is less attractive than \"El Sabor de la Tierruca\" (1882), a striking piece of landscape which won immediate appreciation.\n\nNew ground was broken in \"Pedro Sánchez\" (1883), where Pereda leaves his native province to portray the disillusion of a sincere enthusiast who has plunged into the political life of the capital. Pereda's masterpiece is \"Sotileza\" (1884), a vigorous rendering of marine life. In \"La Puchera\" (1889) he returned to the marine subjects which he knew and loved best. Again, in \"Peñas arriba\" (1895), the love of country life is manifested in the masterly contrast between the healthy fields and the corrupt, squalid cities.\n\nPereda's fame was now established; the statutes of the Spanish Academy, which require members to reside at Madrid, were suspended in his favor (1896). But his literary career was over. The death of his eldest son, the disastrous campaign in Cuba and the Philippines (during the Spanish–American War), darkened his closing years, and his health failed long before his death.\n\nPereda belongs to the native realistic school of Spain, which, founded by the unknown author of \"Lazarillo de Tormes\", was continued by Mateo Alemán, Cervantes, Quevedo and many others. He saw, knew, understood character; he created not only types, but living personages, such as Andres, Cleto and Muergo in \"Sotileza\", Pedro Juan and Pilara in \"La Puchera\"; and he personified the tumult and calm of the sea with more power than Víctor Hugo displayed in \"Les Travailleurs de la mer\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2307949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2307949", "title": "Tom Swifty", "text": "Tom Swifty\n\nA Tom Swifty (or Tom Swiftie) is a phrase in which a quoted sentence is linked by a pun to the manner in which it is attributed. Tom Swifties may be considered a type of wellerism. The standard syntax is for the quoted sentence to be first, followed by the description of the act of speaking. The hypothetical speaker is usually, by convention, called \"Tom\" (or \"he\" or \"she\").\n\nThe name comes from the Tom Swift series of books (1910–present), similar in many ways to the better-known Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew series, and, like them, produced by the Stratemeyer Syndicate. In this series, the young scientist hero underwent adventures involving rocket ships, ray-guns and other things he had invented.\n\nA stylistic idiosyncrasy of at least some books in this series was that the author, \"Victor Appleton,\" went to great trouble to avoid repetition of the unadorned word \"said\", using a different quotative verb, or modifying adverbial words or phrases in a kind of elegant variation. Since many adverbs end in \"ly\" this kind of pun was originally called a Tom Swiftly, the archetypal example being \"'We must hurry,' said Tom Swiftly.\" At some point, this kind of humor was called a Tom Swifty, and that name is now more prevalent.\n\nThis excerpt (with emphasis added) from the 1910 novel \"Tom Swift and His Airship\" illustrates the style:\n\"Oh, I'm not a professor,\" he said quickly. \"I'm a professional balloonist, parachute jumper. Give exhibitions at county fairs. Leap for life, and all that sort of thing. I guess you mean my friend. He's smart enough for a professor. Invented a lot of things. How much is the damage?\"\n\n\"No professor?\" cried Miss Perkman indignantly. \"Why I understood from Miss Nestor that she called some one professor.\"\n\n\"I was referring to my friend, Mr. Swift,\" said Mary. \"His father's a professor, anyhow, isn't he, Tom? I mean Mr. Swift!\"\n\n\"I believe he has a degree, but he never uses it,\" was the lad's answer.\n\n\"Ha! Then I have been deceived! There is no professor present!\" and the old maid drew herself up as though desirous of punishing some one. \"Young ladies, for the last time, I order you to your rooms,\" and, with a dramatic gesture she pointed to the scuttle through which the procession had come.\n\n\"Say something, Tom — I mean Mr. Swift,\" appealed Mary Nestor, in a whisper, to our hero. \"Can't you give some sort of a lecture? The girls are just crazy to hear about the airship, and this ogress won't let us. Say something!\"\n\n\"I — I don't know what to say,\" stammered Tom.\nThe Tom Swifty, then, is a parody of this style with the incorporation of a pun.\n\nA much earlier example may be found, for example, in Dickens' \"Our Mutual Friend\":\n\"How Do You Like London?\" Mr Podsnap now inquired from his station of host, as if he were administering something in the nature of a powder or potion to the deaf child; \"London, Londres, London?\"\n\nThe foreign gentleman admired it.\n\n\"You find it Very Large?\" said Mr. Podsnap, spaciously.\n\n\nTom Swifties first came to prominence in the United States with the 1963 publication of the book \"Tom Swifties\" by Paul Pease and Bill McDonough. The spread of Tom Swifties was abetted by an article in the May 31, 1963 edition of \"Time\" magazine, which also announced a contest for its readers to submit their own Tom Swifties. Included was a special category, \"Time Swifties,\" which were to contain a reference to \"Time\" magazine however, only a few submissions were made of this nature. Among the submissions that were subsequently printed was \"Someone has stolen my movie camera!\" Tom bellowed and howled.\n\nThe \"Time\" contest caused the popularity of Tom Swifties to grow, for a period of some years. Tom Swifties found a large teenage audience on the joke column on the last page of each month's issue of \"Boys' Life\", the magazine for Boy Scouts.\n\nIn January 2017 Jack Waley-Cohen appeared on the British BBC Radio 4 programme \"The Museum of Curiosity\"; his hypothetical donation to this imaginary museum was \"A Book of Tom Swifties\".\n\n"}

He produced albums by Jorge Drexler (Frontera, Sea, Eco, 12 Segundos de Oscuridad), Luciano Supervielle, Bajofondo (Tango Club, Mar Dulce, Presente), El Cuarteto de Nos (Raro, Bipolar, Porfiado), La Vela Puerca (El impulso), OMAR, Sordromo, No Te Va Gustar, Santullo and Ximena Sariñana among others. He created the Bajofondo project alongside iconic producer and two-time Academy Award winner for Best Original Score Gustavo Santaolalla (Brokeback Mountain and Babel). He has been awarded with various Latin Grammy, Premios Gardel and Graffiti awards for his work as a producer, as well as with many golden records.\n\nBorn in Uruguay in 1971, at an early age Campodónico and his family were exiled to Mexico after the 1973 coup. In 1984, back in Montevideo, he began to be part of several rock and pop bands, like Públicas Virtudes, played with different songwriters as a sideman and made music for theatre and advertising. He even was a guitar teacher.\n\nIn the mid 1990s, along with other musicians, he created the band el Peyote Asesino, the first in Uruguay which fused hip-hop, rock and grunge. They also incorporated concepts that became popular in the 90s but still maintained a unique Uruguayan dimension. The band was very popular in Uruguay, influencing other bands and getting adequate circulation. They caught the attention of Gustavo Santaolalla, one of the most important Latin rock professionals, producer of Divididos, Café Tacuba and Molotov, among others. In Los Angeles Santaolalla produced Peyote's second CD entitled \"Terraja\", giving it international exposure.\n\nCampodónico along with Gustavo Santaolalla created Bajofondo in 2001, with the idea of bringing together a collective of Argentine and Uruguayan artists dedicated to creating “contemporary music of the Rio de la Plata\". The project, which appeared under the name Bajofondo Tango Club, initially was an alliance of producers, musicians and singers that took shape in the recording studio, and the release of their first album was the culmination of this process. The album Bajofondo Tango Club, released in November 2002, features a very long list of guest artists. Bajofondo Tango Club won the prestigious Premio Gardel as the \"Best Electronica Music Album\" in Argentina –where the sales reached Triple Platinum- and a Latin Grammy award as the \"Best Instrumental Pop Album\". The album has sold more than 300,000 copies all over the world. \nBajofondo evolved from a producer's concept into a full touring band of eight members (including Santaolalla and Campodónico) that traveled the world. \nThe Bajofondo team launched the solo effort of pianist and composer Luciano Supervielle in 2005. In 2007 they released their second album called Mar Dulce.\nPresente, the third Bajofondo album was released in 2013 and won two Latin Grammys.\n\nCampodónico developed his role as a DJ and remixer, under the name \"Campo\". He has done remixes for Mala Rodríguez and Badfellas, among others.\nIn 2011, he developed a musical project and band under the same name, built upon the instrumental spine of Bajofondo's musicians and a group of composers and performers from different genres and different locations such as songwriter Martin Rivero, Swedish singer Ellen Arkbro, VJ and singer Verónica Loza and electronic musician Pablo Bonilla. \nCAMPO's debut album was produced by Campodonico himself alongside Gustavo Santaolalla; with Joe Chiccarelli, sound engineer of The Strokes, The Shins and The White Stripes.\nThe independent released album, was nominated for a European MTV Europe award, the Grammys, and Latin Grammys. \nEntertainment Weekly pick Campo's song \"1987\" as one of the \"25 songs to download before the Grammys\".\n\nWhen Peyote Asesino split up in 1999, Campodónico found refuge in music production, working with several Uruguayan bands. At that time Jorge Drexler, who was in Madrid and had significant experience there, called him to work and Campodónico along with Carlos Casacuberta (another former member of Peyote) produced his album \"Frontera\" for Virgin / EMI Spanish which was recorded in Uruguay, entirely on a PC. The album was received by the Spanish press with countless accolades, emphasizing the new sound aesthetics of Drexler.\nCampodónico also produced Drexler's albums Sea (2001), Eco (2004) and 12 segundos de oscuridad (2006).\nIn 2006 he did the artistic direction and production of the album \"Raro\" from the group \"El Cuarteto de Nos\" which was nominated in 2007 for a Latin Grammy in the category of \"Best Rock Song\" for \"Yendo a la casa de Damián.\" He was also the producer of Cuarteto's Bipolar (2009) and Porfiado (2012), that won two Latin Grammy Awards. In 2007, along with Gustavo Santaolalla he worked with Calle 13 and produced the song Tango del Pecado included on the album Residente o Vistante.\nIn 2008 he was the co-producer of the album Mediocre from Mexican songwriter Ximena Sariñana.\nIn 2011 he produced the album of Argentinean songstress Deborah del Corral, Nunca o una eternidad.\nBesides the three Bajofondo albums, Campodónico produced with Gustavo Santaolalla all Bajofondo related projects, like Luciano Supervielle's Bajofondo presenta Supervielle (2005) and Reverie (2010), Santullo (2009) and Campo (2011).\n\nCampodónico's music has been used for many syncs in TV series and commercials. Famous Honda Acura commercial, the Warner Channel serie Nikita and the Introduction of the TV GLOBO soap opera A Favorita (Brazil) used the song \"Pa' Bailar\", from Bajofondo's Mar Dulce.\nThe song \"Los Tangueros\", reached number 2 on the Club Playlist on the Dance Chart in Billboard magazine in the United States. \nThe song \"Mi Corazón\" included in Bajofondo Tango Club, has been played in many parts of the world in both commercials, on television programs and in an HBO series. \"Montserrat\" has been used by Macy's. \nHe produced a song for the soundtrack of the film Shrek II.\nIn 2013 Campodónico along with Jaime Roos and Pablo Bonilla, composed the original soundtrack for the Uruguayan film Jugadores con Patente.\n\nWith Peyote Asesino:\n\nWith Bajofondo:\n\nWith Campo:\n\nJorge Drexler\n\nCuarteto De Nos\n\nLuciano Supervielle\n\n\nSantullo\n\n\nXimena Sariñana\n\n"}

Enterohepatic circulation is an especially important concept in the field of toxicology as many lipophilic xenobiotics undergo this process causing repeated liver damage.\n\nHepatocytes metabolize cholesterol to cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. These lipid-soluble bile acids are conjugated (reversibly attached) mainly to glycine or taurine molecules to form water soluble primary conjugated bile acids, sometimes called \"bile salts\". These bile acids travel to the gall bladder during the interdigestive phase for storage and to the descending part of the duodenum via the common bile duct through the major duodenal \npapilla during digestion. 95% of the bile acids which are delivered to the duodenum will be recycled by the enterohepatic circulation.\n\nDue to the pH of the small intestine, most of the bile acids are ionized and mostly occur as their sodium salts which are then called “primary conjugated bile salts.” In the lower small intestine and colon, bacteria dehydroxylate some of the primary bile salts to form secondary conjugated bile salts (which are still water-soluble). Along the proximal and distal ileum, these conjugated primary bile salts are reabsorbed actively into hepatic portal circulation. Bacteria deconjugate some of the primary and secondary conjugated bile salts back to lipid-soluble bile acids, which are passively absorbed into hepatic portal circulation. Finally, the conjugated bile acids which remained un-ionized conjugated bile acids are passively absorbed.\n\nVenous blood from the ileum goes straight into the portal vein and then into the liver sinusoids. There, hepatocytes extract bile acids very efficiently, and little escapes the healthy liver into systemic circulation. \n\nThe net effect of enterohepatic recirculation is that each bile salt molecule is reused about 20 times, often multiple times during a single digestive phase.\n\nThe presence of biliary acids in the intestines helps in absorption of fats and other substances.\n\nBilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid in the liver by the enzyme glucuronyltransferase, making it soluble in water. Much of it goes into the bile and thus out into the small intestine. Although 95% of the secreted bilirubinoid bile is reabsorbed by the small intestine, conjugated bilirubin is not reabsorbed in small intestine. All conjugated bilirubin in the large intestine is metabolised by colonic bacteria to urobilinogen, which is then further oxidized to urobilin and stercobilin. Urobilin, stercobilin and their degradation products give feces its brown color. However, just like bile, some of the urobilinogen reabsorbed is resecreted in the bile which is also part of enterohepatic circulation. The rest of the reabsorbed urobilinogen is excreted in the urine where it is converted to an oxidized form, urobilin, which gives urine its characteristic yellow color.\n\nEnterohepatic circulation of drugs describes the process by which drugs are conjugated to glucuronic acid in the liver, excreted into bile, metabolized back into the free drug by intestinal bacteria, and the drug is then reabsorbed into plasma. For many drugs that undergo this process, lower doses of drugs can be therapeutically effective because elimination is reduced by the 'recycling' of the drug. But for a small number of drugs that are very toxic to the intestine (e.g. irinotecan), these molecules which would not otherwise be very toxic can become so because of this process, and therefore inhibition of this step can be protective. For the majority of drugs which undergo enterohepatic circulation that are not toxic to the intestine, inhibition of this process leads to a reduction of the levels of drug and reduced therapeutic effect. For example, antibiotics that kill gut bacteria often reduce enterohepatic drug circulation and this requires a temporary increase of the drug's dose until the antibiotic use is discontinued and the gut repopulates with bacteria. This effect of antibiotics on enterohepatic circulation of other drugs is one of several types of drug interactions.\n\nPharmacokinetic models of the enterohepatic circulation process has been summarized in a recent article.\n\n"}

Chicago is also home to the largest futures exchange in the world, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nAcross the state, other Fortune 500 world headquarters based in Illinois include State Farm in Bloomington and John Deere in Moline. As of 2017, Illinois ranked fourth in the nation for the most Fortune 500 based companies with a total of 36. For six consecutive years, Chicagoland was ranked the nation's top metropolitan area for corporate relocations.\n\nThe 2018 total gross state product for Illinois was $857 billion, placing it fifth in the nation. The 2017 median household income was $62,992, one of the nation's highest. In 2016, the nine counties of the Chicago metropolitan area accounted for 77.3% of the state's total wages, with the remaining 93 counties at 22.7%. The state's industrial outputs include machinery, food processing, electrical equipment, chemical products, publishing, fabricated metal products and transportation equipment. Corn and soybeans are important agricultural products. Service industries of note are financial trading, higher education, logistics, and medicine.\n\nMost of the state of Illinois lies outside the Chicago metropolitan area and inside the North American Corn Belt. Corn, soybeans, and other large-field crops are grown extensively. These crops and their products account for much of the state's economic output outside Chicago. Much of the field crop is remanufactured into feed for hogs and cattle. Dairy products and wheat are important secondary crops in specific segments of the state. \nIn addition, some Illinois farmers grow specialty crops such as popcorn and pumpkins. The state is the largest producer of pumpkins among the U.S. states. There is a large watermelon growing area centered on Lincoln, Illinois. Illinois wine is a growing industry. In December 2006, the Shawnee Hills were named Illinois's first American Viticultural Area (AVA).\n\nManufacturing in Illinois accounts for 14% of the state's total output and generates $101 billion in economic activity. Illinois's manufacturing sector grew out of its agricultural production. A key piece of infrastructure for several generations was the Union Stock Yards of Chicago, which from 1865 until 1971 penned and slaughtered millions of cattle and hogs into standardized cuts of beef and pork.\n\nIn 1893 Illinois manufacturers formed the Illinois Manufacturers' Association in opposition to the Sweatshop Law of 1893 that prohibited child labor and mandated an eight-hour workday. Governor Peter Altgeld had made Florence Kelley the Chief Factory Inspector for the state of Illinois. The association sponsored a number of cases which led to the Illinois Supreme Court finding that Section 5 of the Act, which limited women's working weeks to 48 hours and their day to eight hours, unconstitutional in 1895. After Governor Altgeld was not re-elected in 1896 and Kelley was removed from her position, flagrant violations of the child labor provision were reported.\n\nThe centralized location of Illinois made it a key manufacturing hub, especially for farm machinery and specialty motor vehicles. Smaller Cities like Aurora, Peoria, Decatur, Rockford and other cities became major manufacturing centers in the 20th century. In downstate Illinois, the John Deere Company became one of the world's largest makers of farm machinery, and Caterpillar achieved similar dominance in its diversified line of off-road vehicles.\n\nThe Chicago area, meanwhile, began to produce significant quantities of telecommunications gear, electronics, steel, automobiles, and industrial products.\n\nAs of 2004, the leading manufacturing industries in Illinois, based upon value-added, were chemical manufacturing ($16.6 billion), food manufacturing ($14.4 billion), machinery manufacturing ($13.6 billion), fabricated metal products ($10.5 billion), plastics and rubber products ($6.8 billion), transportation equipment ($6.7 billion), and computer and electronic products ($6.4 billion).\n\nIllinois currently ranks second in the Midwest for total installed renewable power capacity and fifth nationally for installed wind power capacity. The renewable energy economy has created 114,000 jobs in Illinois and will continue to see growth after a $15 billion investment from the Future Energy Jobs Act in 2016.\n\nGovernor J.B. Pritzker committed Illinois to the U.S. Climate Alliance in 2019 which will further drive economic growth in renewable energy across the state.\n\nBy the early 2000s, Illinois's economy had moved toward a dependence on high-value-added services such as financial trading, higher education, logistics, and medicine. In some cases, these services clustered around institutions that hearkened back to Illinois's earlier economies. For example, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a trading exchange for global derivatives, had begun its life as an agricultural futures market.\n\nIn the late 2010s, the Chicago Metropolitan Area continued to lead the nation in luring corporate relocations or expanded corporate facilities.\n\nIn 2018, Illinois set a new tourism record with 117 million tourists which represented a 3 million person increase from the previous year. Visitors spent nearly $42 billion in spending the same year.\n\nThe Institute of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign publishes a \"flash-index\" that aims to measure expected economic growth in Illinois. The indicators used are corporate earnings, consumer spending and personal income. These indicators are measured through tax receipts, adjusted for inflation. 100 is the base, so a number above 100 represents growth in the Illinois economy, and a number below 100 represents a shrinking economy. Data from the index, from 6/1981 to the present, can be found here.\n\n"}

May 18, 2002, New York City) was an actress and Yiddish theatre empresaria.\n\nBorn Zypora Tannenbaum, she worked in her native Poland as a midwife for many years, delivering hundreds of children, including during World War II when she witnessed horrendous suffering. After emigrating to the United States in 1954, she became an actress.\n\nSpaisman, during her career as an actress, was long associated with the Folksbiene Yiddish Theatre in NYC and, along with Morris Adler, kept it alive for 42 years. Following a dispute with the Folksbiene's new management in 1998, she founded the Yiddish Public Theatre.\n\nThe Folksbiene Yiddish Theatre, originally located on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in what was then known as the Forward Building and later ensconced across from the Central Synagogue in its Community House building (both locations during Spaisman's tenure), is the longest-running Yiddish theatre company in the world. Founded in 1915 as an amateur group dedicated to producing non-commercial Yiddish theater and world drama in Yiddish translation, it turned professional in later decades. It was sustained by Morris Adler, who joined the company in 1934, and Spaisman, who joined twenty years later. During Spaisman and Adler's tenure, the Folksbiene remained a bastion for Yiddish literary culture. \n\nIn 1998, Ms. Spaisman's position with the company was taken over by Zalmen Mlotek and Eleanor Reissa, who were then named co-artistic directors. They invited Spaisman to stay on as a \"consultant\" but she opted to start her own company, the Yiddish Public Theater, which endured for one year before its demise.\n\nZypora Spaisman assayed the role of Sheva Haddas in Paul Mazursky's film \"Enemies, a Love Story\" (1989), an adaptation of Isaac Bashevis Singer's novel of the same name.\n\nA documentary by Dan Katzir about Spaisman and her Yiddish Public Theater, \"Yiddish Theater: A Love Story,\" was released to much acclaim in 2006.\n\nIn the summers, Zypora Spaisman worked as a camp nurse at Camp Boiberik, in Rhinebeck, NY. The camp was an offshoot of The Sholem Aleichem Folk Institute.\n\nShe was married to Joseph Spaisman until his death; the couple had one son, who survived her following her sudden and unexplained death from cerebral trauma on May 18, 2002, aged 86.\n\n"}
{"id": "2307964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2307964", "title": "Fantasy football (association)", "text": "Fantasy football (association)\n\nFantasy football (less commonly referred to as fantasy association football worldwide but known as fantasy soccer in the United States and Canada) is a game in which participants assemble an imaginary team of real life footballers and score points based on those players' actual statistical performance or their perceived contribution on the field of play. Usually players are selected from one specific division in a particular country, although there are many variations. The original game was created in England by Bernie Donnelly on Saturday 14 August 1971 and is still going strong 45 years later. Fantasy football has evolved in recent years from a simple recreational activity into a significant business due to exposure via the internet.\n\nAn emerging variant is club-based fantasy football in which participants select players from within their own club. Participating clubs typically have more than one football team and adopt club fantasy football to increase communication and banter between teams. Some clubs charge a nominal amount for players to enter a team and either use the proceeds as a fundraiser or to fund the fantasy league prizes. Club fantasy football leagues tend to be less sophisticated than the national variety since most clubs run them on a spreadsheet. Niche sports websites now offer online versions with both paid and free versions available.\n\nMost fantasy football leagues, especially those run by national newspapers, ask participants to select 11 players within a price budget. There is usually a restriction on the number of players per club; a typical selection would be to select 1 goalkeeper, 4 defenders, 4 or 3 midfielders and 2 or 3 forwards. Some games are squad-based, where participants choose not just a first eleven but also a set of substitutes. Normally you can only use max. 3 players of one team.\n\nIn smaller leagues played by a small group of people, players are bought by bidding between the rival managers rather than for a set amount of money. This means a particular player can only play for one team, and thus any points he accrues are credited to that team only. Typically, most leagues offer the chance to transfer players in and out of the team as the season progresses, in case of injury, suspension or loss of form.\n\nPoints are then gained or deducted depending on players' performances. Points systems vary between games, but points are typically awarded for some or all of the following achievements:\n\nAs well as the above, points can be deducted for some or all of the following:\n\nThe number of points each achievement or offense is credited with varies between different games. For example, in the Daily Telegraph league, three points are awarded for an assist, and five for a goal. Due to the emphasis placed on assists and goal-scoring, the value of players can differ greatly from real-life football, both in terms of individuals and position. For example, Claude Makelele, a world-class central midfield player, was rarely considered a valuable player in fantasy football because he was not an attacking player, as evidenced by three league goals in eight years at Real Madrid and Chelsea, and zero for the French national team in seventy-one appearances.\n\nFor this reason, some fantasy football games changed their scoring system to put a greater emphasis on real player performance instead of emphasizing goals and assists. For instance, the game KAISER uses player scores gained by computer analyses based on dozens of different criteria. These scores are supplied by the data provider OPTA.\n\nThe game Oulala Fantasy Football uses a sophisticated scoring system. With 70 different points scoring criteria, which includes a matrix of any action that a player can perform, the criteria of 70 rises to a total of 275 dependent on each player's position on the field. Detailed actions include corners won, shots on/off target, successful dribbles and provoking an offside as well as many more others. These stats are sourced from Opta Sports and update in real time. Oulala ceased to exist in 2018. \n\nMost fantasy football games provide a choice of joining either private or public leagues. Public leagues are open to everybody and mostly there are leagues for each club or leagues for each country. League members then compete against each other and in some cases there is cash prizes for winning those leagues. Private leagues let the manager play with their friends only. Some games combine this with having unique teams in the leagues. This means that every Premier League player exists only once. As a result, there is a lot of activity on the transfer market where players are exchanged in between the community members.\n\nAt the start of the season, fantasy football leagues can be set up in various ways. For leagues with unique teams, i.e. leagues where every player exists only once, there are at least two different starter options. Option 1 is a player auction. Every player is auctioned and the manager of a community needs to bid for the players. Managers have a certain budget for the auction. Option 2 is a player draft. Each manager is allocated a certain number of players.\n\nFor leagues without unique teams, i.e. every manager can own every player if he has sufficient funding, there is usually neither a draft nor an auction but managers can pick their players until they have used up their budget.\n\nVarious fantasy football games with unique teams offer the option of a player auction. At the beginning of the season, players are put on a transfer market and manager can bid for them. Some games even continue this auction system during the season (e.g. kaiser.co.uk). Kaiser also offers the opportunity to take the league to the next season. In this case new leagues can be started throughout the season without making it less interesting.\n\nThe draft is an option to jump-start a league. This is especially interesting for leagues that are set up during the season. From day one, managers can line up their team for the next match day and trade players with other community members or using the computer. The draft is a common feature for National Football League fantasy football games and the German Bundesliga. More than one Premier League manager game offers a similar feature.\n"}

It encompasses five Southern Illinois counties (and parts of three others) in the St. Louis Metropolitan Statistical Area. The region's most populated city is Belleville, with 45,000 residents. The Metro East is the second largest urban area in Illinois after the Chicago metropolitan area and, as of the 2000 census, the population of the Metro East statistical area is 702,597 residents, a figure that has risen above 700,000 in 2010. The significant growth in the Metro East is mainly due to people in smaller outlying towns in Illinois moving to the area for better economic/job opportunities. \nThe Metro East is a loose collection of small and mid-sized cities sitting along the American Bottom and the bluffs of the Mississippi River. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the five counties of the region have a total area of 6,974 km (2,692 mi). 6,787 km (2,620 mi) of it is land and 186 km (71 mi) of it (2.74%) is water.\n\nAs of the 2010 census, the most populated cities in the region include\n\nAs of the 2010 census, there had been a major shift in population from the older rust belt industrial cities in the Mississippi River bottom, such as East St. Louis and Alton, to the more suburban satellite cities, such as, Belleville, Edwardsville, and O'Fallon sitting on the bluffs. This is mainly due to continued white flight.\n\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 599,845 people, 229,888 households, and 160,260 families residing in the five Metro East counties.\n\nThe most common language is English, although various other languages are spoken. German speakers exist in southeastern Madison, and Clinton, and southern and eastern St. Clair Counties. Spanish is spoken in the Fairmont City area, and in parts of Clinton County. The largest concentration of African-Americans is in Madison, Venice, western Granite City, East St. Louis, Washington Park, Belleville, Cahokia, Alorton and Alton. Secondary languages tend to be cultural or reminiscent of ancestry, and not related to the general business of the area.\n\nNotes: \n\n\n\n\nThe Metro East is connected with Missouri by the Metro Link light rail train. The Metrolink includes 11 stations on the Illinois side of St Louis, from the East St. Louis Riverfront, through Belleville Illinois, and ending at Scott Air Force Base. It links the Metro East to downtown St. Louis, area universities, downtown Clayton, and the major commercial airport, Lambert St. Louis International.\n\nSt. Clair County (East St. Louis, Washington Park, Fairview Heights, Swansea, O'Fallon, Cahokia, Belleville, Shiloh, and Scott AFB) share public transit with the St. Louis metropolitan area, including bus and rail.

He studied at the University of Paris, and is said to have had some curious adventures at one time working in a mine. He was, however, a scholar by natural taste, and became eventually a teacher at the Collège de Plessis, and on the death of Ramus was made professor of Latin in 1572 in the Collège de France.\n\nIn the meanwhile Passerat had studied law, and had composed much agreeable poetry in the Pléiade style, the best pieces being his short ode \"Du Premier jour de mai\" and the villanelle whose first line is \"J'ay perdu ma tourterelle\".

He is often illustrated as a short, bearded man dressed in gray clothes and a red hat.\n\nIn modern Danish culture Julemanden is the equivalent of the English Father Christmas although the roots of the character reach into Danish folklore and mythology wherein Julemanden is a mythical character who is said to bring Christmas presents to children in Denmark on Christmas Eve, celebrated December 24.\nAccording to myths, he would come to houses either by foot or by sleigh and often wears fur to keep him warm.\n\nJulemanden is a relatively new phenomenon in Denmark, appearing some time after World War 2.\nUntil then, there was \"Nissefar\", \"Nissekongen\" or \"Julenissen\" - a character with several resemblances to the modern \"Julemand\".\nThis tradition is traced back centuries when people believed in Nisser (elves, leprechauns, spirits or mystical entities rarely or never seen directly). Local folklore dictated the expected actions of the Nisser, which could be moody creatures resulting in all kinds of fortunes or even disasters.\n\nThe role of the \"Julenisse\" was to bring good fortune to the family and to achieve this, he would have to be treated well especially around Jul (December). This was achieved by feeding him, traditionally with some form of porridge (now rice porridge). Traditionally, the porridge was to be placed in the household attic as this was said to be the place where the Nisse supposedly lived and if the Nisse was satisfied with the meal he would bring good fortune to the household in the coming year.\n\nThe \"Julenisse\" is still, however, \"celebrated\" and he acts as a stand-in for \"Julemanden\" in early December, to entertain the childish mind, bring small gifts and sometimes plays tricks on the household, kindergarten etc. where such \"creatures\" can prosper.\n\nThe gift-giving Nisse that became \"Nissekongen\" seems to have drawn influences from the American \"Santa\", when American culture began making an impact in Denmark, but rather than outright copying him, local traditions were tweaked, eventually resulting in a \"Father Christmas\" type character with only traces of the original \"Nisse\" and in some respects indistinguishable from \"Santa\".\n\nIn an attempt to attract more than 800,000 tourists, the Tivoli theme park in Copenhagen replaced their Julemanden display to that of its Russian counterpart – Father Frost in 2011.\n\nIn Denmark a special postal address is used by Post Danmark for children who want to write to Julemanden:\n\n\"Rensdyrvej\" translates as \"Reindeer Way\", while the PO Box number 2412 is a reference to 24 December.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his role in the television sitcom \"Hogan's Heroes\" as Corporal Louis LeBeau.\n\nBorn in 1926 in Paris, France, Clary was the youngest of 14 children. At the age of twelve, he began a career singing professionally on a French radio station and also studied art in Paris. In 1942, because he was Jewish, he was deported to the Nazi concentration camp at Ottmuth, in Upper Silesia (now Poland). He was tattooed with the identification \"A5714\" on his left forearm. He was later sent to Buchenwald concentration camp.\n\nAt Buchenwald, he sang to an audience of SS soldiers every other Sunday, accompanied by an accordionist. He said, \"Singing, entertaining, and being in kind of good health at my age, that's why I survived. I was very immature and young and not really fully realizing what situation I was involved with ... I don't know if I would have survived if I really knew that.\"\n\nWriting about his experience, Clary said, \n\nWe were not even human beings. When we got to Buchenwald, the SS shoved us into a shower room to spend the night. I had heard the rumours about the dummy shower heads that were gas jets. I thought, 'This is it.' But no, it was just a place to sleep. The first eight days there, the Germans kept us without a crumb to eat. We were hanging on to life by pure guts, sleeping on top of each other, every morning waking up to find a new corpse next to you. ... The whole experience was a complete nightmare — the way they treated us, what we had to do to survive. We were less than animals. Sometimes I dream about those days. I wake up in a sweat terrified for fear I'm about to be sent away to a concentration camp, but I don't hold a grudge because that's a great waste of time. Yes, there's something dark in the human soul. For the most part, human beings are not very nice. That's why when you find those who are, you cherish them.\nClary was liberated from Buchenwald on April 11, 1945. Twelve other members of his immediate family were sent to Auschwitz concentration camp; Clary was the only survivor. When he returned to Paris after World War II, he learned that three of his 13 siblings had not been taken away and had survived the Nazi occupation of France.\n\nClary returned to the entertainment business and began singing songs that not only became popular in France, but in the United States as well. Clary made his first recordings in 1948; they were brought to the United States on wire and were issued on disk by Capitol Records. He went to the U.S. in October 1949. One of Clary's first American appearances was a French language comedy skit on \"The Ed Wynn Show\" in 1950. Clary later met Merv Griffin and Eddie Cantor. This eventually led to Clary meeting Cantor's daughter, Natalie Cantor Metzger, whom he married in 1965, after being \"the closest of friends\" for 15 years. Cantor later got Clary a spot on \"The Colgate Comedy Hour\". In the mid-1950s, he appeared on NBC's early sitcom \"The Martha Raye Show\" and on CBS's drama anthology series \"Appointment with Adventure\".\n\nClary's comedic skills were quickly recognized by Broadway, where he appeared in several popular musicals, including \"New Faces of 1952\", which was produced as a film in 1954. In 1952, he appeared in the film \"Thief of Damascus\" which also starred Paul Henreid and Lon Chaney, Jr. In 1958, he guest-starred on NBC's \"The Gisele MacKenzie Show\". He also guest starred on the colour revival of ‘’The Munsters’’ – ‘‘The Munsters Today’’ in 1989 as Louis Schecter, Lily's acting coach, in the episode \"Green Eyed Munster\".\n\nIn 1965, the diminutive 155 cm (5 ft 1 in) Clary was offered the role of Corporal Louis LeBeau on a new television sitcom called \"Hogan's Heroes\", and he accepted the role when the pilot sold. The series was set in a German prisoner of war (POW) camp during World War II, and Clary played a French POW who was a member of an Allied sabotage unit operating from inside the camp.\n\nAsked about parallels between LeBeau's incarceration and his own, Clary said, \"Stalag 13 is not a concentration camp. It's a POW camp, and that's a world of difference. You never heard of a prisoner of war being gassed or hanged. When the show went on the air, people asked me if I had any qualms about doing a comedy series dealing with Nazis and concentration camps. I had to explain that it was about prisoners of war in a Stalag, not a concentration camp, and although I did not want to diminish what soldiers went through during their internments, it was like night and day from what people endured in concentration camps.\"\n\nClary became one of the last two surviving principal cast members of \"Hogan's Heroes\", with Kenneth Washington (Sergeant Richard Baker, final season), when Cynthia Lynn (Helga, first season, 1965–1966) died on March 10, 2014. He is the last surviving original principal cast member.\n\nAfter \"Hogan's Heroes\" went off the air, Clary maintained close ties to fellow \"Hogan's Heroes\" cast members Werner Klemperer, John Banner and Leon Askin, whose lives were also affected by the Holocaust. Following the show's cancellation, he appeared in a handful of feature films with World War II themes, including the made-for-television film \"Remembrance of Love\", about The Holocaust. Clary also appeared on the soap operas \"Days of Our Lives\", \"The Young and the Restless\", and \"The Bold and the Beautiful\".\n\nClary appeared in the 1975 film \"The Hindenburg\", which portrayed a fictional plot to blow up the German airship after it arrived at the Lakehurst Naval Air Station. He played Joseph Späh, a real-life passenger on the airship's final voyage.\n\nClary spent years touring Canada and the United States, speaking about the Holocaust. He is a painter, painting from photographs he takes on his travels.\n\nClary wrote a memoir, \"From the Holocaust to Hogan's Heroes: The Autobiography of Robert Clary\" in 2001. \n\nToday, Robert Clary lives in his Beverly Hills home where he has retired, and has become an artist, where he maintains his backyard as a Parisian garden, and runs his own website.\n\n\n\n"}

On film, Yarnell played Dot Matrix (body acting, with Joan Rivers performing the voice) in the 1987 Mel Brooks movie \"Spaceballs\".\n\nThe Shields and Yarnell comedy act originated in their partnership. Their specialty was a series of skits called \"The Clinkers\" in which they assumed the personae of robots, with many individual, deliberate motions (as opposed to normal smooth motion) stereotypical of robots and early animatronics, enhanced by their ability to refrain from blinking their eyes for long stretches of time.\n\nTheir dance and mime performances were featured 1977-1978 on their own CBS television comedy-variety program, \"The Shields and Yarnell Show\". They appeared on 400 national television shows in the US, including \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour\", \"The Red Skelton Show\", \"The Muppet Show\" (1979), and \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\". The pair played the \"Six-Hundred-Dollar People\" created by Dr. Loveless, Jr. in the 1979 TV movie \"The Wild Wild West Revisited\". They performed in the unsuccessful Broadway musical production \"Broadway Follies\" in New York City, which closed after only one performance following bad reviews that night. Career highlights included shows for two American Presidents, a command performance for Queen Elizabeth II, and a tour of China with comedian Bob Hope.\n\nTheir television special \"Toys on the Town\", written by Shields, earned an Emmy Award.\n\nThey won an award as Las Vegas \"Entertainer of the Year,\" dual Georgies for \"Rising Stars of the Year\" and \"Special Attraction of the Year\" from the American Guild of Variety Artists.\n\nShields and Yarnell married in 1972 and divorced in 1986. Shields opened a jewelry and art business in Sedona, Arizona, while Yarnell remarried and moved to Norway. They reunited periodically to tour with their act.\n\nIn 2002, Shields met Laurie Burke, a singer-songwriter in Sedona, and the two were married on September 25, 2006. Burke was diagnosed with a brain tumor the next spring, and died on April 25, 2007. Shields married Jennifer Griffiths in December 2009. The couple divorced in 2014. Shields currently resides in Verde Valley, Arizona, where he creates paintings, sculptures, and jewelry design.\n\nYarnell moved to Sandefjord, Norway, in 1998 with her third husband Bjørn Jansson. She died of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm on July 29, 2010, at the age of 66.\n\n"}

{"id": "2307991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2307991", "title": "Marshrutka", "text": "Marshrutka\n\nMarshrutka (Russian & Ukrainian: \"маршру́тка\" , from \"marshrutn[oy]e taksi\") or routed taxicab, is a form of public transportation such as share taxi which originated in the Soviet Union and is still present in Russia and other countries of CIS, in Baltic states, Bulgaria, Georgia, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Armenia. The role of the modern marshrutka is theoretically similar to the share taxi, which uses minibuses in some other countries. The first marshrutka was introduced in Moscow, Russia in 1938.\n\nThe Russian word \"маршрутка\" is the colloquial form for \"маршрутное такси\", which literally means \"routed taxi\" (\"маршрут\" referring to a planned route that something follows, and \"такси\" meaning \"taxi\"). The word \"маршрут\" is from the German word \"Marschroute\", which is composed of the words \"Marsch\" (a walk, march) and \"Route\" (route).\n\n\"Route taxicabs\" were introduced in Moscow for the first time in the USSR in 1938, operated by ZiS-101 limousines. They offered ordinary people a chance to ride in luxurious ZiS cars, otherwise reserved for high officials. At first they were meant mainly for tourists and serviced mainly stations and airports.\n\nUnlike ordinary taxicabs using taximeters, routed taxicab rides charged by zones, like trams, buses and trolley buses. The fares ranked cheaper than those of ordinary taxis but higher than in large-scale public transport. Unlike ordinary taxis, where a passenger could enjoy a private ride, the routed taxicab would pick up and drop passengers along its route. During communist rule, state-owned taxicab parks operated all marshrutkas.\n\nOther large Soviet cities (apart from Moscow) organized routed taxis. For example, Gorky had a routed taxi line between Sormovo and the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin. , the full fare was 3½ roubles; a similar service cost 1 rouble with a bus, or 50 kopecks with a tram.\n\nDuring the World War II of 1941-1945, as the Red Army requisitioned cars, routed taxi services ceased. They resumed in Moscow in 1945. Only by the 1950s did they re-appear in most cities where they had operated before the war. ZiS-110 and GAZ-12 ZIM cars served widely in this role until the mid-1960s.\n\nRouted taxicabs also offered interurban services. From Moscow they drove to distant cities, like Simferopol, Kharkiv, Vladimir, Tula, and Riazan. For example, the Moscow-Yalta route operated in the summer, taking two days, with a night stop in Belgorod (near Kursk).\n\nIn the 1960s, RAF-977 minibuses became the most common routed-taxi vehicles, replacing passenger cars. Municipal authorities operated the routes; thus, the quality and concept varied greatly between regions. The fare gap between buses and routed taxicabs lessened. For example, in Moscow the standard bus fare cost 5 kopecks, and the minibus fare was 15 kopecks on most routes; in Gorky a regular bus-ride cost 6 kopecks, and a routed-taxi ride 10 kopecks.\n\nLater, the new model RAF-2203 Latvija (introduced in 1975) replaced the RAF-977 minibuses. Eventually, practically all marshrutka services used RAF-2203 Latvijas; many people referred to marshrutkas as \"Latvias\" or \"RAFicks\".\n\nThe introduction of market economies greatly changed the supply of transportation in the urban population in the CIS. The demand for faster and more versatile public transit came to be fulfilled dramatically, while the demand for the underfunded municipal transportation system dropped; people were willing to pay premium for better service. Although buses (like Ikarus, LAZ, PAZ, RAF, and KAvZ, as well as irregular imported used minibuses), obtained on a secondary market, had been used by entrepreneurs as a back-up on the busiest routes since the early 1990s, it wasn't until the auto manufacturer GAZ rolled out in 1996 the first mass-produced Russian minibus, GAZelle, that the modern system took shape.\n\nGAZelle was an instant hit. The cheap, easy-to-repair, and lease-friendly passenger minibus with a capacity of twelve seated passengers was exactly what entrepreneurs needed. An initial investment of around US$8,000 could be paid off in less than a year given some luck. A lot of individual entrepreneurs entered the market, as well as some larger companies. At this time, licensing for public transportation in particular was not required. The vehicle only had to pass annual safety check-ups, which were relatively easy, since local authorities trusted GAZ cars. Moreover, the GAZelle could be easily equipped to run on natural gas.\n\nDuring this period, most marshrutkas followed well-established public transit routes.\n\nWitnessing the success of privately owned public transportation led to some reaction from the society. Local authorities responded by toughening safety and licensing requirements—like mandatory free transportation of a certain number of disabled passengers upon request and \"package deals\" in route licensing—tying the privilege to drive on a lucrative route to the chore of driving several not-so-profitable ones. The market became dominated either by large companies or by unions of owner-operators of individual minibuses. Some of municipal public transportation companies entered the business, and prices dropped due to increased competition.\n\nAnother consequence was a massive response from car and bus manufacturers. Old manufacturers introduced smaller, more manoeuvrable models (like PAZ or KAZ) and started licensed assembly of minibuses (KrAZ started assembling Iveco minibuses). Diesel-engined models in the form of the new Isuzu Bogdan, Tata Etalon and others have seen immense popularity. The capacity grew from fifteen sitting passengers to jam-packed small buses of fifty. The busiest routes in major cities now use full-size privately owned buses operating at the same price with municipal companies. The original GAZelle saw a few official modifications to its body, length and passenger capacity to better serve buyer demands, including models featuring diesel engines.\n\nIn Russia, GAZelle, Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, Peugeot Boxer, Fiat Ducato, Renault Master, Volkswagen Crafter, Iveco Daily and Ford Transit vans are usually used as route taxis, although in eastern parts the Japanese minibuses like Toyota Hiace are more popular. Often they (except GAZelle and Japanese vans) are refurbished from vans to special enterprises (such as ST Nizhegorodets, PKF Luidor, Promteh-NN and others) by cutting windows, inserting the glass, installing seats, automatic sliding doors, trim and handrails (are licensed manufacturers of vans for a given activity and are sold through the official dealer network). Route taxis congregate at train stations, metro stations, and transfer points at the end of tram and trolly bus routes. Minibuses are also used, such as PAZ-3205 (in small towns), PAZ-3204, Bogdan, Hyundai County, as well as small buses from China.\n\nIn St. Petersburg the route is identified as \"Kxxx\" with \"xxx\" being the number of the bus, tram and trolley bus routes being followed and \"K\" standing for the Russian word for \"commercial\" (коммерческий, \"kommerchesky\"). There are routes traveled solely by route taxis — cross-city routes connecting termini of the metro. Usually, the route taxi will not depart the start point of a route until all seats are occupied.\n\nIn the Gazelle no standing places due to a lack of height, and filled the cabin, they do not stop at the request of people standing at the bus stop, and stop when the one or more seats become vacant (the driver monitors the filling and turns away extra passengers at the entrance), and in all other shuttles stand-up and they stay there, regardless of occupancy. The taxi will skip stops if they are not requested and (if operated with a GAZelle or similar) by-pass hailing riders until it has empty seats. The fare is commonly one and a half or twice the fare of a regular bus.\n\nThe appeal for the route taxi passenger is officially considered to be a faster ride in less-crowded conditions than regular transport; the taxi routes that follow cross-city routes are most often the fastest. However, collapse of municipal transport services in many cities makes it absolutely impractical to commute without the help of marshrutkas at all.\n\nIn St. Petersburg average marshrutka fare is 35 roubles (.70 euro) per person, with intercity bus fares reaching 70 roubles (1.40 euros). In other cities (e.g., Novosibirsk) it can be as low as 20 roubles (.40 euro) per person. Passengers either pay with cash or transportation cards (e-wallet).\n\nIn 2016 Moscow has banned marshrutkas and integrated private buses into the city transport network. Private buses now operate on set routes and accept regular tickets. However, marshrutkas with routes leading to or originating from Moscow Oblast are allowed to operate in the city and in 2019 are still common in the districts bordering Moscow Oblast such as Vykhino-Zhulebino, Novokosino or Levoberezhny.\n\nIt is relatively cheap and fast to ride a marshrutka. The only drawback foreigners have noticed is the poor noise insulation, which makes it so that you have to practically scream at the driver to request a stop.\n\nIn Ukraine, the Bogdan A091 and A092 buses are the most common route taxi which can be found operating in towns and cities. Generally the fare is higher than city owned public buses. Alighting the bus is possible regardless of the designated bus stop, but generally this is up to driver's discretion. State Automobile inspection (ДАІ) forbids picking up passengers outside of the designated bus stops. Marshrutkas do not require tickets, although a passenger can ask for a ticket when paying the fare as a receipt for expense claim purposes.\n\nEtalons and Bogdans usually have a conductor on board selling the tickets. In the GAZelle or converted van, the fare is paid directly to the driver, either upon pickup or departure of the passenger. It is common etiquette for passengers to relay the fare of fellow passengers to the driver, and the change back on crowded buses.\n\nIn Kyiv, Ukraine and probably other places marshrutkas evolve into \"everybody pays\" fast buses. The vehicles can be small, medium-size, and sometimes big buses, with a higher fare than on ordinary municipally funded buses. The main thing about marshrutkas is they do not carry pensioners and the disabled; depending on the city, students, law enforcement workers, and civil servants (pass holders) ride for free. Marshrutkas will not take more free passengers (e.g. disabled) than the strictly limited quantity of one per vehicle, while in ordinary buses, trolleybuses and trams the number is not limited and more categories of people (pensioners, etc.) have the right to ride for free. This is the reason why there are many times more marshrutkas in the city than ordinary buses, trolleybuses and trams altogether. \n\nSince municipally funded buses must transport pass holders for free, naturally pass holders tend to use a municipal bus versus a private bus. The word \"taxi\" is needed just to answer the question why they have no free-ride obligations as part of their franchise, as ordinary municipal buses, which are usually \"full of free riders\", are unprofitable and bring economical loss. A marshrut may even charge the same fare as a municipal bus in the city, but marshrut will still be profitable since there is an effective doubling of the price due to there being one or no free pass riders on board.\n\nIn the 1990s when local authorities temporarily lost their ability to finance city bus work, the bus drivers installed in their buses windows tablets with inscription \"Taxomotor.\" That just meant that every passenger has to pay the fare.\n\nSo, now marshrutkas are public route microbuses, middle-size buses and sometimes big buses which go usually faster than ordinary buses and more frequently, but do not take month subscription tickets and take no more privileged free passengers than the strictly limited quantity of per one marshrutka.\n\nStopping marshrutka in the city, at established stops, comes out of practice, being difficult because of the large number of passengers and the high frequency of the stops.\n\nIn Minsk, Belarus, the fleet of vehicles is the same as Russia, consisting of Mercedes-Benz Sprinter and Ford Transit.\n\nIn Moldova, \"rutierele\" run all over the capital and to most large cities in the country. Most rutierele are white and have only the roof vent and front windows for airflow. Rutierele will usually seat around 16 people with space for another 15 to 20 to stand while holding railing.\n\nIn Yerevan, Armenia, marshrutkas ( \"maršrutka\" or երթուղային տաքսի \"ert’uġayin tak'si\") cost the same as larger buses (100 AMD in 2018), with the fare being paid when the passenger exits. There are no tickets issued. Marshrutkas can be hailed anywhere along their route, though they do have specific stops and riders can exit at any point if the driver is willing to pull over. While the law requires that marshrutkas stop only at designated stops while on major streets, compliance with this law depends on the driver and the degree of police enforcement at any given time.\n\nMarshrutkas are the primary form of vehicular intercity transit in Armenia (outside of the Ararat Valley, where some full-sized bus lines operate). For example, as of January 2016, there is an hourly route between Yerevan and Ijevan — an approximately two-hour trip — costing 1500 AMD. From most bus stations in Armenia, it is possible to find marshrutka routes connecting to several nearby small or mid-size cities.\n\nIn Tbilisi, Georgia, marshrutkas (\"მარშრუტკა\" \"marshrutka\"; officially, \"სამარშრუტო ტაქსი\", \"samarshruto taksi\", \"route taxi\") vary in cost from 50 tetri to 80 tetri. Up until 2011, all marshrutkas in Tbilisi had a common fare of 50 tetri. However, after introducing new Ford Transit minibus vehicles, the price went up and is now at 80 tetri. Marshrutkas stop upon passengers' request. There are no specific stops. In most Marshrutkas, the driver is paid in cash, but all cabs can accept payments from Tbilisi Metroman card (pre-loaded city transportation card).\n\nBulgarian marshrutkas are customized passenger vans. They have been modified to include large windows in the back, rails and handles.\nIn some cases, seating has been modified — popular routes carrying more passengers typically have more standing space.\n\nSofia's marshrutka system is considerably developed and has existed since the late 1980s, offering many routes crossing through the city centre, communicating with outer suburbs and nearby villages. The Sofia fleet includes such models as the Peugeot Boxer, Citroën Jumper, Ford Transit, Iveco Daily and Renault Master. Other cities have adopted a similar system and models available vary from city to city.\n\nSimilar to public transport, they operate along numbered routes around the city and have a fixed fare (1.50 leva in Sofia, equivalent to €0.75 as of 2014); the fare is paid upon getting in. Marshrutkas are not obliged to stop anywhere on the route, although there are popular spots where they do slow down. Marshrutka drivers are asked to stop and pick one up in a taxi-like manner; the getting-off is arranged with the driver, often by just standing up and approaching the door. Sometimes the driver will ask for consent to veer off the charted path to avoid a traffic jam or roadworks.\n\nMarshrutkas are commonly white, although their colour can vary, and they are often partially covered in advertising. There are about 50 marshrutka lines in Sofia alone; the lines being operated by separate private companies. About 10 lines operate in Plovdiv.\n\nIn Romania, \"microbuze\" or \"maxi-taxi\" supplied the need of affordable public transportation in smaller towns when some local administrations dismantled the expensive community-owned systems of buses. In Bucharest, this form of transportation appeared in the early 1980s, when the ITB began using them as a peak-hour service, beginning to use Irannational-made Mercedes-Benz T2 vans, being supplemented in the late 1980s by Rocar-TV vans. In 1990, the newly-founded RATB sold off its operations to private operators, who began using them in competition to the RATB. They enjoyed wide popularity, especially from 2003 to 2007, and from 2011 onwards, when the RATB lost the rights to operate suburban routes. On the Black Sea shore, it is very common to travel from Constanţa or Mangalia to the resorts on microbuze, especially in those resorts where the competing train service is far from the beach and/or lodging facilities. The minibuses (microbuze) have been criticised for their shady operations, lack of safety and primitive transportation conditions.\n\nHistorically, marshrutkas (\"mikroautobuss\" in Latvian) were a common means of transport in larger cities of the Latvian SSR, the RAF-2203 was the only minibus used for this purpose.\n\nIn today's Latvia, marshrutkas are no longer in service in most cities, including Riga. Minibuses with a fixed schedule and fixed bus stops have taken over as the prevailing means of transport in places where marshrutkas once dominated.\n\nIn Lithuania, marshrutkas had been in service in a variety of cities since the end of the 1980s – mostly in Vilnius and Kaunas, but also in Klaipėda, Šiauliai and elsewhere. They were mainly used as public transportation in city limits but sometimes their routes extended outside the city limits. Marshrutkas were widely used, with travelers themselves explaining that the marshrutkas are a much faster way of public transportation than buses or trolleybuses.\n\nNowadays marshrutkas are banned in Vilnius, Kaunas, Panevėžys, Šiauliai and Klaipėda.\n\nIn Estonia, marshrutkas (\"Marsruuttakso\" in Estonian) are used in Tallinn. They are mostly used on routes connecting the city to small towns nearby, such as Saku, Saue and Kose where most people have cars and demand for public transport is lower but the many departure times are still useful. Late evening departures may have higher fares because local trains and other alternative means of transportation are not running. In late evening marshrutkas are also good choice for suburbs where bus services end around midnight, but some marshrutkas continue to run.\n\nIn Central Asia (at least in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan), standing room is allowed on marshrutkas. Indeed, drivers will often encourage passengers to board the marshrutka and cram together until there is not enough space for another passenger to board. In such a case, once a passenger exits the marshrutka, the driver will stop for others and allow them on until it is full again. Marshrutkas may be boarded at bus stops, but will usually stop other places if hailed, and often won't stop at bus stops unless a passenger requests an exit or a prospective passenger hails the marshrutka.\n\nPassengers may request to exit at any point but may have to wait until the driver deems that it is convenient to stop.\n\nThe typical Central Asian marshrutka is usually a white minibus branded \"Mercedes\", though may come in any number of colours, sometimes used to distinguish a specific route. The models most commonly used have a vent in the roof that may be opened by passengers if the atmosphere inside becomes too stuffy. Though not the norm, other vehicles are used as well.\n\nThe normal price per fare in Bishkek is 10 som and there are no transfers. Some routes may charge as much as 15 som per fare, such as marshrutkas heading to Dordoy Bazaar, which is on the outskirts of the city. From Manas International Airport to Osh bazaar in Bishkek is 40 som. In Almaty, on 3 January 2008, bus fare was increased from 40 tenge to 60 tenge (about 40 cents). Prices range throughout Central Asia, dependent on whether it is a city or village, the local cost of living, distance covered by route, and government policy.\n\nThere is no domestic marshrutka tradition in Finland as the country has not been a part of Soviet Union. Public transport has been tightly controlled using licensing for taxis and hereditary route concessions or a complete takeover by city transport authorities for bus traffic since the 1930s leaving no possibilities for marshrutka-type services.\n\nAs the regulation applies only to \"domestic\" transportation, there are marshrutkas operating in Finland. In international transportation, Russian marshrutkas have been operating after the breakup of Soviet Union between Helsinki and St Petersburg. They can be boarded only for trips crossing the Finnish-Russian border. Marshrutkas are the cheapest way of traveling between Helsinki and St Peterburg.\n\nSimilar systems can be found in South East Asia, like the Philippines with minibuses called jeepneys and Thailand with minibuses called songthaew.\n\nSome African countries have a similar system, with minibuses called matatu (Kenya), dala dala (Tanzania) or tro tro (Ghana).\n\n\n"}

The erection of the marquisate of Baudricourt in 1719 had the effect of changing the name of the village which was called Saint-Menge until 1766.\n\nIn July 1767 letters patent of Louis XV allowed that the name of Bassompierre be attributed to the seigniory of Baudricourt.

{"id": "2308023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308023", "title": "Great Pumpkin", "text": "Great Pumpkin\n\nThe Great Pumpkin is an unseen character in the comic strip \"Peanuts\" by Charles M. Schulz. According to Linus van Pelt, the Great Pumpkin is a supernatural figure who rises from the pumpkin patch on Halloween evening, and flies around bringing toys to sincere and believing children. Linus continues to have faith in the Great Pumpkin, despite his friends' mockery and disbelief. The Great Pumpkin was first mentioned in the strip on October 26, 1959.\n\nEvery year, Linus sits in a pumpkin patch (a place Linus believes is the most sincere and lacking in hypocrisy) on Halloween night waiting for the Great Pumpkin to appear. Invariably, the Great Pumpkin fails to turn up, but a humiliated yet undefeated Linus stubbornly vows to wait for him again the following Halloween. Linus acknowledges the similarities between the Great Pumpkin and Santa Claus, the existence of which Linus considers to be ambiguous (in the television special, Linus tells Charlie Brown he'll stop believing in the Great Pumpkin when Charlie Brown stops believing in Santa Claus, while writing to the Great Pumpkin that Santa Claus has better publicity). Charlie Brown attributes Linus's belief in the Great Pumpkin to \"denominational differences\". Linus is faithful to the belief of the Great Pumpkin, even creating a Great Pumpkin magazine at one point. \n\nThe Great Pumpkin was first mentioned by Linus in \"Peanuts\" in 1959, and Schulz reworked the premise many times throughout the run of the strip. It inspired the 1966 animated television special \"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\" and had brief mentions in \"You're Not Elected, Charlie Brown\" (1972) (by which Linus almost blows his chances in a school election); \"It's the Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown\" (1974) in which Sally expresses her concerns about the Easter Beagle's reality to Linus, citing her previous experience with the non appearance of the Great Pumpkin; and \"You're a Good Sport, Charlie Brown\" (1975), wherein Linus enters the pumpkin patch to make a makeshift motorcycle helmet for Charlie Brown for a motocross race, with Charlie being teased as being the Great Pumpkin by some race fans. It was also briefly referenced in \"The Peanuts Movie\" (2015), where Linus says he hopes the new kid in town, later revealed as the Little Red-Haired Girl, would be willing to believe in it. The best-known quote regarding Linus and the Great Pumpkin, originally from the comic strip but made famous by the TV special, is: \"There are three things I have learned never to discuss with people: religion, politics, and the Great Pumpkin.\"\n\nWhile Schulz usually avoided outright politics, he enjoyed his Great Pumpkin strips and incorporating religious references in many comics and animated cartoons.\n\nAlthough the Great Pumpkin is supposedly believed in only by Linus—the strips of October 29 and November 1, 1961 make mention of officially reported Great Pumpkin sightings in Connecticut, Texas and New Jersey. In these strips, reports transmitted through indirect speech lead to phenomena of unreliable narration.\n\nThe Great Pumpkin has been a symbol of strong faith and foolish faith, leading to vastly different interpretations of creator Charles Schulz's own faith. As described in the book on Schulz's religious views, \"A Charlie Brown Religion\", Schulz's views were very personal and often misinterpreted. Linus' seemingly unshakable belief in the Great Pumpkin, and his desire to foster the same belief in others, has been interpreted as a parody of Christian evangelism by some observers. Others have seen Linus' belief in the Great Pumpkin as symbolic of the struggles faced by anyone with beliefs or practices that are not shared by the majority.\n\nStill others view Linus' lonely vigils, in the service of a being that may or may not exist and which never makes its presence known in any case, as a metaphor for mankind's basic existential dilemmas. Charles Schulz himself, however, claimed no motivation beyond the humor of having one of his young characters confuse Halloween with Christmas. In the 1959 sequence of strips in which the Great Pumpkin is first mentioned, for instance, Schulz also has Linus suggest that he and the other kids \"go out and sing pumpkin carols\", something which he also asks the trick-or-treating kids in the special itself.\n\nCollege football coach Dee Andros (1924–2003), was known by the nickname \"The Great Pumpkin\" as head coach (1965–75) and athletic director (1976–85) at Oregon State University in Corvallis.\n\nAs the head coach of the orange and black Beavers, Andros had a round physique and often wore an orange windbreaker. He was first dubbed with the nickname in 1966 by a member of the Spokane press on Halloween weekend in Pullman, Washington, as his OSU team routed host Washington State's Cougars, 41–13.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Braniff Airways painted its fleet in bright colors, for visual appeal and marketability. The airline's first 747-200 airliners were delivered painted in a striking shade of orange, causing several air traffic control centers across the US to welcome the new Braniff acquisitions with the phrase \"Welcome, Great Pumpkin\". The 1973 Petersen Publications annual, \"Air Progress: World's Greatest Aircraft,\" had its chapter devoted to the 747 headed \"The Great Pumpkin Lives!\"\n\nIn 1996, Burlington Northern SD60M #9297 (renumbered 8197 in 2008, renumbered 1474 in 2014) was jokingly dubbed the \"Great Pumpkin\" by employees because of its bold orange paint scheme, one of many prototype paint designs created by the then newly formed Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (BNSF), a merger of Burlington Northern and the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway (Santa Fe). This scheme eventually became the basis for BNSF's \"Heritage I\" paint design, while the \"Great Pumpkin\" nickname has stuck among railfans for this particular locomotive.\n\nOne episode from season 2 was called \"It's the Great Pancake, Cleveland Brown\".\n\nIn the opening cameo of \"Treehouse of Horror II\" the Peanuts gang in Halloween costumes are passing in front of the Simpson house. The final segment of \"Treehouse of Horror XIX\" (the fourth episode of the twentieth season of \"The Simpsons\"), called \"It's the Grand Pumpkin, Milhouse\", is a parody of \"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\" and contains numerous references to the \"Peanuts\" characters. Milhouse Van Houten wears the same clothes and plays the same role as Linus van Pelt. Lisa Simpson is modeled after Sally Brown, and Bart is patterned after Charlie Brown (even saying \"Good grief!\" at one point). A redesigned version of Santa's Little Helper can be seen sleeping atop his dog house a la Snoopy, while Homer is seen sleeping on top of the family house in a similar manner.\n\nWhen Marge first speaks, her voice is replaced with a muted trombone sound, a parody of the \"wah wah wah\" voice that is used for adults in all \"Peanuts\" specials. The dance scene during the Halloween party is a parody of the dance scene in \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" right down to Kang and Kodos in a nonspeaking cameo as the twins \"3 and 4\". Parts of the segment had music by Vince Guaraldi (best known for composing music for animated adaptations of the \"Peanuts\" comic strip), which they had obtained the rights to use.\n\nIn the episode segment, Milhouse waits in a pumpkin patch on Halloween for the Grand Pumpkin (which Bart made up) with Lisa. After Lisa sees everyone at school having a Halloween party, she grows tired of waiting and leaves in frustration. Milhouse starts to cry and his tears and childlike belief bring the Grand Pumpkin to life. However, the Pumpkin is appalled to find that his kindred pumpkins are being carved up on Halloween and made into pumpkin bread, originally thinking it was bread especially made for pumpkins until Milhouse revealed it is made from them, and vows revenge. He devours Homer as he carves a pumpkin, then marches to the school and eats Nelson who threatens to stab a yellow pumpkin. It becomes apparent at this point that the Grand Pumpkin is racist towards this type of pumpkin and then eats Groundskeeper Willie after being offered roasted pumpkin seeds. Realizing that Milhouse can bring things to life by believing in them, Lisa tells him about \"Tom Turkey\", a symbol of Thanksgiving. Milhouse starts to believe in Tom Turkey, who comes to life and kills the Grand Pumpkin, freeing everyone he ate. However, when Tom Turkey learns that people eat turkeys on Thanksgiving from Bart, he vows revenge and starts angrily chasing children around the school, devouring some of them whole as Marge wishes the viewers happy holidays.\n\nA sketch in the episode \"Vegetable Funfest\" of the stop-motion parody show \"Robot Chicken\" featured a \"Peanuts\" parody in which Linus tires of never seeing the Great Pumpkin. He conducts a magical ritual involving burning a chicken in a pentagram to summon the entity, which is revealed to be Lovecraftian in nature, feeding on children. The Great Pumpkin murders Linus and proceeds to stalk the other characters with similar intentions. Charlie Brown is saved by the similarly demonic Kite-Eating Tree, which consumes the Pumpkin. Charlie Brown declares that his deceased friends can now rest in peace. The murdered characters are then shown in Hell dancing with the devil as Schroeder plays his piano.\n\nWhen the \"Peanuts\" strip was first introduced in Italy, Halloween was almost unknown there as a festivity. The earlier translations turned the pumpkin into a watermelon \"(\"Il Grande Cocomero\")\" because it was felt as a more Mediterranean fruit-figure and its name sounded better. The intentional mistranslation did somehow stick in the Italian pop culture, so that it was kept in all the later translations. There was also a movie named after \"Il grande cocomero\" in 1993, directed by Francesca Archibugi.\n\nThe Major League Baseball player Dan Johnson is nicknamed \"The Great Pumpkin\" due to his orange-red beard and his notable late-season/autumn performance. Johnson was called to the majors late in three separate seasons (2008, 2010, 2011), and subsequently hit clutch home runs that propelled his team into the playoffs.\n\nSeason 4, episode 7 of the television series \"Supernatural\" is called \"It's the Great Pumpkin, Sam Winchester\".\n\nOn October 30, 2015, the \"Wizard of Id\" comic strip made a tribute to Linus and the Great Pumpkin. The wizard makes a spell \"making a dream come true for a special little boy\". The last panel shows a large pumpkin, growling, chasing a boy who has a blue blanket (ostensibly Linus).\n\nCharlie Brown, Linus, and the Great Pumpkin are referenced in Helloween's song \"\", alluding to the events in It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown:\n\n\"\"Someone's sitting in a field, never giving yield.\"\n\"Sitting there with gleaming eyes.\"\n\"Waiting for Big Pumpkin to arise.\"\"\n\n\"\"Bad luck if you get a stone\"\n\"like the good old Charlie Brown, you think Linus could be right.\"\n\"The kids will say it's just a stupid lie.\"\"\n\nIn October 2010, forty-four years after the initial airing of \"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\", the Great Pumpkin was the topic of a licensed use by the online game \"Poptropica\". The site's 15th island is Great Pumpkin Island, and features several of the \"Peanuts\" characters interacting with players. As the island follows the same plot as the original TV special, the Great Pumpkin does not appear, and turns out to be Snoopy with a pumpkin on his head.\n\n"}

These rights are specifically identified in a Constitution, or have been found under Due Process of law.\n\nSome universally recognised rights that are seen as fundamental, i.e., contained in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the U.N. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, or the U.N. International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, include the following:\n\nThe Canadian Bill of Rights Citation: S.C. 1960, c. 44 Enacted by: Parliament of Canada is the most important document in the protection of the human rights of Canadians. \n\nEnacted by: Parliament of Canada\n\nDate assented to: 10 August 1960\n\nCitation: S.C. 1960, c. 44\nIn Canada, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms outlines four Fundamental Freedoms. These are freedom of:\n\nEurope has no identical doctrine (It would be incompatible with the more restrained role of judicial review in European law.) However, EU law recognizes many of the same human rights and protects them through other means.\n\nSee also: Copenhagen criteria, and European Convention on Human Rights, which every member state of the EU has to comply with and for which the European Court of Human Rights has final appellate jurisdiction.\n\nThe Indian fundamental rights, contrasted with such rights contained in the US bill of rights, present several peculiarities. The fundamental rights in India are far more elaborate than in the United States. Thus, for example, the US bill of rights (first ten amendments) only names some rights. The Supreme Court, through the process of judicial review, decides the limitations on \nThere are seven main fundamental rights of India:\n\nNewly implemented 7th Fundamental right in India is\n\nIt was added in the constitution after the 86th amendment in the year 2002 under article 21A. It is the most recently implemented fundamental right. The RTE Act enabled this right in the year 2010.\n\nA recent addition was made to the list of fundamental rights in India in 2017.\n\nThough many fundamental rights are also widely considered human rights, the classification of a right as \"fundamental\" invokes specific legal tests courts use to determine the constrained conditions under which the United States government and various state governments may limit these rights. In such legal contexts, courts determine whether rights are fundamental by examining the historical foundations of those rights and by determining whether their protection is part of a longstanding tradition. Individual states may guarantee other rights as fundamental. That is, States may add to fundamental rights but can never diminish or infringe upon fundamental rights by legislative processes. Any such attempt, if challenged, may involve a \"strict scrutiny\" review in court.\n\nIn American Constitutional Law, \"fundamental rights\" have special significance under the U.S. Constitution. Those rights enumerated in the U.S. Constitution are recognized as \"fundamental\" by the U.S. Supreme Court. According to the Supreme Court, enumerated rights that are incorporated are so fundamental that any law restricting such a right must both serve a compelling state purpose and be narrowly tailored to that compelling purpose.\n\nThe original interpretation of the United States Bill of Rights was that only the Federal Government was bound by it. In 1835, the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Barron v Baltimore\" unanimously ruled that the Bill of Rights did not apply to the states. During post-Civil War Reconstruction, the 14th Amendment was adopted in 1868 to rectify this condition, and to specifically apply the whole of the Constitution to all U.S. states. In 1873, the Supreme Court essentially nullified the key language of the 14th Amendment that guaranteed all \"privileges or immunities\" to all U.S. citizens, in a series of cases called the Slaughterhouse cases. This decision and others allowed post-emancipation racial discrimination to continue largely unabated.\n\nLater Supreme Court justices found a way around these limitations without overturning the Slaughterhouse precedent: they created a concept called Selective Incorporation. Under this legal theory, the court used the remaining 14th Amendment protections for equal protection and due process to \"incorporate\" individual elements of the Bill of Rights against the states. \"The test usually articulated for determining fundamentality under the Due Process Clause is that the putative right must be 'implicit in the concept of ordered liberty', or 'deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.'\" Compare page 267 Lutz v. City of York, Pa., 899 F. 2d 255 - United States Court of Appeals, 3rd Circuit, 1990.\n\nThis set in motion a continuous process under which each individual right under the Bill of Rights was incorporated, one by one. That process has extended more than half a century, with the free speech clause of the First Amendment first incorporated in 1925 in Gitlow v New York. The most recent amendment completely incorporated as fundamental was the Second Amendment right to possess and bear arms for personal self-defense, in McDonald v Chicago, handed down in 2010 and the Eighth Amendment's restrictions on excessive fines in Timbs v. Indiana in 2019.\n\nNot all clauses of all amendments have been incorporated. For example, states are not required to obey the Fifth Amendment's requirement of indictment by grand jury. Many states choose to use preliminary hearings instead of grand juries. It is possible that future cases may incorporate additional clauses of the Bill of Rights against the states.\n\nThe Bill of Rights lists specifically enumerated rights. The Supreme Court has extended fundamental rights by recognizing several fundamental rights not specifically enumerated in the Constitution, including but not limited to:\nAny restrictions a government statute or policy places on these rights are evaluated with strict scrutiny. If a right is denied to everyone, it is an issue of substantive due process. If a right is denied to some individuals but not others, it is also an issue of equal protection. However, any action that abridges a right deemed fundamental, when also violating equal protection, is still held to the more exacting standard of strict scrutiny, instead of the less demanding rational basis test.\n\nDuring the Lochner era, the right to freedom of contract was considered fundamental, and thus restrictions on that right were subject to strict scrutiny. Following the 1937 Supreme Court decision in \"West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish\", though, the right to contract became considerably less important in the context of substantive due process and restrictions on it were evaluated under the rational basis standard.\n\n"}

During the struggle against Napoleon he took the patriotic side, was elected deputy, and at Cadiz produced his first play, \"Lo que puede un empleo\", a prose comedy in the manner of the younger Leandro Fernández de Moratín. \"La Viuda de Padilia\" (1814), a tragedy modelled upon Alfieri, was less acceptable to the Spanish public.\n\nMeanwhile, the author became more and more engulfed in politics, and in 1814 was banished to Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera on the Barbary Coast, where he remained until 1820, when he was suddenly recalled and appointed prime minister. During the next three years he was the most unpopular man in Spain; denounced as a revolutionist by the Conservatives and as a reactionary by the Liberals, he alienated the sympathies of all parties, and his rhetoric earned for him the contemptuous nickname of Rosita la Pastelera (Rosie the compromiser/cake maker).\n\nExiled in 1823, he took refuge in Paris, where he issued his \"Obras literarias\" (1827), including his \"Arte poética\", in which he exaggerated the literary theories already promulgated by Luzan.\n\nReturning to Spain in 1831, he became prime minister on the death of Ferdinand VII, but proved incapable of coping with the insurrectionary movement and resigned in 1834. It is worth noting that, before retiring, Martinez de la Rosa, as President of the Cabinet, approved the royal decree that finally abolished the Spanish Inquisition.\n\nHe was ambassador at Paris in 1839-1840 and at Rome in 1842–1843, joined the Conservative party, held many important offices, and was president of congress and director of the Spanish academy at the time of his death, which took place at Madrid on the 7th of February 1862.\n\nAs a statesman, Martinez de la Rosa never rose above mediocrity. It was his misfortune to be in place without real power, to struggle against a turbulent pseudo-democratic movement promoted by unscrupulous soldiers, and to contend with the intrigues of the king, the court camarilla and the clergy. But circumstances which hampered him in politics favoured his career in literature. He was not a great natural force; his early plays and poems are influenced by Leandro Moratín or by Juan Meléndez Valdés; his \"Espíritu del siglo\" (1835) is a summary of all the commonplaces concerning the philosophy of history; his \"Doña Isabel de Solís\" (1837–1846) is an imitation of Walter Scott's historical novels.\n\nThrough the accident of his exile at Paris he was thrown into relations with the leaders of the French Romantic Movement, and was so far impressed with the innovations of the new school as to write in French a romantic piece entitled \"Abén Humeya\" (1830), which was played at the Porte Saint-Martin. On his return to Madrid Martinez de la Rosa produced \"La Conjuracíon de Venecia\" (April 23, 1834), which entitles him to be called the pioneer of the romantic drama in Spain.\n\n\n \n"}

It has been regarded as \"one of the most important C++ books\" by Scott Meyers.\n\nThe book makes use of and explores a C++ programming technique called template metaprogramming. While Alexandrescu didn't invent the technique, he has popularized it among programmers. His book contains solutions to practical problems which C++ programmers may face. Several phrases from the book are now used within the C++ community as generic terms: \"modern C++\" (as opposed to C/C++ style), policy-based design and typelist.\n\nAll of the code described in the book is freely available in his library Loki.\nThe book has been republished and translated into several languages since 2001.\n\nPolicy-based design, also known as policy-based class design or policy-based programming, is the term used in \"Modern C++ Design\" for a design approach based on an idiom for C++ known as policies. It has been described as a compile-time variant of the strategy pattern, and has connections with C++ template metaprogramming. It was first popularized in C++ by Andrei Alexandrescu with \"Modern C++ Design\" and with his column \"Generic<Programming>\" in the \"C/C++ Users Journal\", and it is currently closely associated with C++ and D as it requires a compiler with highly robust support for templates, which was not common before about 2003.\n\nPrevious examples of this design approach, based on parameterized generic code, include parametric modules (functors) of the ML languages, and C++ allocators for memory management policy.\n\nThe central idiom in policy-based design is a class template (called the \"host\" class), taking several type parameters as input, which are instantiated with types selected by the user (called \"policy classes\"), each implementing a particular implicit interface (called a \"policy\"), and encapsulating some orthogonal (or mostly orthogonal) aspect of the behavior of the instantiated host class. By supplying a host class combined with a set of different, canned implementations for each policy, a library or module can support an exponential number of different behavior combinations, resolved at compile time, and selected by mixing and matching the different supplied policy classes in the instantiation of the host class template. Additionally, by writing a custom implementation of a given policy, a policy-based library can be used in situations requiring behaviors unforeseen by the library implementor. Even in cases where no more than one implementation of each policy will ever be used, decomposing a class into policies can aid the design process, by increasing modularity and highlighting exactly where orthogonal design decisions have been made.\n\nWhile assembling software components out of interchangeable modules is a far from new concept, policy-based design represents an innovation in the way it applies that concept at the (relatively low) level of defining the behavior of an individual class. Policy classes have some similarity to callbacks, but differ in that, rather than consisting of a single function, a policy class will typically contain several related functions (methods), often combined with state variables or other facilities such as nested types. A policy-based host class can be thought of as a type of metafunction, taking a set of behaviors represented by types as input, and returning as output a type representing the result of combining those behaviors into a functioning whole. (Unlike MPL metafunctions, however, the output is usually represented by the instantiated host class itself, rather than a nested output type.)\n\nA key feature of the \"policy\" idiom is that, usually (though it is not strictly necessary), the host class will derive from (make itself a child class of) each of its policy classes using (public) multiple inheritance. (Alternatives are for the host class to merely contain a member variable of each policy class type, or else to inherit the policy classes privately; however inheriting the policy classes publicly has the major advantage that a policy class can add new methods, inherited by the instantiated host class and accessible to its users, which the host class itself need not even know about.) A notable feature of this aspect of the policy idiom is that, relative to object-oriented programming, policies invert the relationship between base class and derived class - whereas in OOP interfaces are traditionally represented by (abstract) base classes and implementations of interfaces by derived classes, in policy-based design the derived (host) class represents the interfaces and the base (policy) classes implement them. In the case of policies, the public inheritance does not represent an is-a relationship between the host and the policy classes. While this would traditionally be considered evidence of a design defect in OOP contexts, this doesn't apply in the context of the policy idiom.\n\nA disadvantage of policies in their current incarnation is that the policy interface doesn't have a direct, explicit representation in code, but rather is defined implicitly, via duck typing, and must be documented separately and manually, in comments. The main idea is to use commonality-variability analysis to divide the type into the fixed implementation and interface, the policy-based class, and the different policies. The trick is to know what goes into the main class, and what policies should one create. The article mentioned above gives the following answer: wherever we would need to make a possible limiting design decision, we should postpone that decision, we should delegate it to an appropriately named policy.\n\nPolicy classes can contain implementation, type definitions and so forth. Basically, the designer of the main template class will define what the policy classes should provide, what customization points they need to implement.\n\nIt may be a delicate task to create a good set of policies, just the right number (e.g., the minimum necessary). The different customization points, which belong together, should go into one policy argument, such as storage policy, validation policy and so forth. Graphic designers are able to give a name to their policies, which represent concepts, and not those which represent operations or minor implementation details.\n\nPolicy-based design may incorporate other useful techniques. For example, the template method pattern can be reinterpreted for compile time, so that a main class has a skeleton algorithm, whichat customization pointscalls the appropriate functions of some of the policies.\n\nThis will be achieved dynamically by concepts in future versions of C++.\n\nPresented below is a simple (contrived) example of a C++ hello world program, where the text to be printed and the method of printing it are decomposed using policies. In this example, \"HelloWorld\" is a host class where it takes two policies, one for specifying how a message should be shown and the other for the actual message being printed. Note that the generic implementation is in codice_1 and therefore the code is unable to be compiled unless both policies (codice_2 and codice_3) are provided.\n\ntemplate <typename OutputPolicy, typename LanguagePolicy>\nclass HelloWorld : private OutputPolicy, private LanguagePolicy {\n\nclass OutputPolicyWriteToCout {\n};\n\nclass LanguagePolicyEnglish {\n\nclass LanguagePolicyGerman {\n\nint main() {\n\nDesigners can easily write more codice_4s by adding new classes with the member function codice_2 and take those as new codice_4s.\n\nLoki is the name of a C++ software library written by Andrei Alexandrescu as part of his book \"Modern C++ Design\".\n\nThe library makes extensive use of C++ template metaprogramming and implements several commonly used tools: typelist, functor, singleton, smart pointer, object factory, visitor and multimethods.\n\nOriginally the library was only compatible with two of the most standard conforming C++ compilers (CodeWarrior and Comeau C/C++): later efforts have made it usable with a wide array of compilers (including older Visual C++ 6.0, Borland C++ Builder 6.0, Clang and GCC). Compiler vendors used Loki as a compatibility benchmark, further increasing the number of compliant compilers.\n\nMaintenance and further development of Loki has been continued through an open-source community led by Peter Kümmel and Richard Sposato as a SourceForge project. Ongoing contributions by many people have improved the overall robustness and functionality of the library. Loki is not tied to the book anymore as it already has a lot of new components (e.g. StrongPtr, Printf, and Scopeguard). Loki inspired similar tools and functionality now also present in the Boost library collection.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2308091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308091", "title": "Richard Montagu", "text": "Richard Montagu\n\nRichard Montagu (or Mountague) (1577 – 13 April 1641) was an English cleric and prelate.\n\nMontagu was born during Christmastide 1577 at Dorney, Buckinghamshire, where his father Laurence Mountague was vicar, and was educated at Eton. He was elected from Eton to a scholarship at King's College, Cambridge, and admitted on 24 August 1594. His name occurs in the list of junior fellows for the quarter Midsummer to Michaelmas 1597. He graduated BA before Lady Day 1598, MA 1602, BD 1609. He assisted Sir Henry Savile in the literary work he carried on at Eton, and the second book issued from the Eton press was his edition of \"The two Invectives of Gregory Nazianzen against Julian\", 1610. He was also to have edited Basil the Great, but the work was never completed.\n\nIn 1610, he received the living of Wootton Courtney, Somerset; on 29 April 1613, he was admitted Fellow of Eton and in the same year received the rectory of Stanford Rivers, Essex. On 9 December 1616 he was installed Dean of Hereford, a post which he exchanged with Oliver Lloyd for a canonry of Windsor, in which he was installed on 6 September 1617. He was admitted Archdeacon of Hereford on 15 September 1617. He held also the rectory of Petworth, Sussex, where he rebuilt the parsonage, and was chaplain to the king. He held these preferments with his fellowship at Eton by dispensation from James I.\n\nOn the death, in 1614, of Isaac Casaubon, with whom he had previously corresponded about the \"Exercitationes ad Baronii Annales\" (against Baronius), Montagu was directed by the King to publish the work. It appeared the same year, and in 1615 James requested him to prepare an answer to Baronius on similar lines. This work, based on studies of classical and patristic antiquity, was at first apparently held back at Archbishop George Abbot's command, but it was issued in 1622 under the title of \"Analecta Ecclesiasticarum Exercitationum\". In the epistle dedicatory addressed to the King, Montagu states his object to be to trace the origins of Christian faith and doctrine, and show that the Anglican position was derived from the \"ancient founts\". Montagu's aim was to support the Church of England against its enemies. He would not recognise the foreign Reformed bodies as lawful branches of the church. He never completed the task which he had set himself.\n\nIn his \"Diatribae upon the first part of the late History of Tithes\", 1621, he entered directly into the controversy of the day, in an attempt to beat John Selden on tithes. Controversy against Catholic teachers in his parish was answered in a pamphlet called \"A Gag for the New Gospel\", by Matthew Kellison; he replied in \"A Gagg for the New Gospell? No. A New Gagg for an old Goose\", 1624. The 'Gagg' had contained forty-seven propositions which it attributed to the Church of England. Of these Montagu only allowed eight to be her true doctrine, again demarcating Anglican doctrine on two fronts. He also issued a defensive work, rebutting Marco Antonio de Dominis who charged Montagu with supporting \"praying unto saints and angels in time of need\". It proved a magnet for controversy, with answer after answer coming from the presses. There was a complaint from two East Anglian ministers, John Yates and Nathaniel Ward; Ward had been overseas to 1624, and it was a few years later that he became vicar of Stondon Massey, close to Stanford Rivers in Essex, and one of Thomas Hooker's anti-Laudian group. The House of Commons referred the book to Abbot. Abbot applied for authority to the King, and remonstrated with Montagu. But James himself approved of his work. \"If that is to be a Papist\" he said, \"so am I a Papist\". The matter did not rest with the King's death.\n\nControversy around Montagu's positions played an important part in the period 1625–9, both in publications and in political moves, and was one of the issues setting the tone for the reign of Charles I. Montagu had the open support of three bishops (John Buckeridge, John Howson, and William Laud). His \"Appello Caesarem: a just Appeale from two unjust Informers\" (London, 1625) came out with an imprimatur from Francis White, dean of Carlisle, after George Abbot's refusal to license it. It was partly written in self-justification, but also attacked some Calvinist tenets, including the perseverance of the saints. Francis Rous defended double predestination against Montagu in \"Testis Veritatis\" (1626).\n\nThe House of Commons took up the matter, and accused the author of dishonouring the late King (James I). A debate on the matter was followed by Montagu's committal to the custody of the serjeant-at-arms. He was, however, allowed to return to Stanford Rivers on giving a bond. Charles then made Montagu one of his chaplains, and let the Commons know on 9 July that he was displeased. On 11 July parliament was prorogued. On 2 August, when the parliament was sitting at Oxford, Montagu was too ill to attend, and after discussion in which Edward Coke and Robert Heath took part, the matter was allowed to drop. But the question was too serious to rest for long. On 16 and 17 January 1626 a conference was held by Charles's command, as the result of which the bishops of London (George Montaigne), Durham (Richard Neile), Winchester (Lancelot Andrewes), Rochester (Buckeridge), and St. David's (Laud) reported to George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham that Montagu had not gone further than the doctrine of the Church of England, or what was compatible with it.\n\nThe January meeting was followed shortly by a watershed conference beginning 11 February, prompted by Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick in Buckingham's house, York House, Strand, and later called the York House conference. It took place with the Bishop of Lichfield (Thomas Morton) and the master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge (John Preston), representing the opposition to Montagu and Francis White. Buckeridge, supported by White and John Cosin, defended Montagu's orthodoxy. Buckeridge even denied that the Council of Trent had erred in any directly fundamental article of faith. A second conference was held a few days later, at which Montagu defended his theses in person against Morton and Preston. The two days of discussion, attended by nobility, changed no minds.\n\nThe committee of religion renewed their censure of the \"Appeal\", and the House of Commons voted a petition to the King that the author might be fitly punished and his book burned. The King issued a proclamation (14 June 1626) commanding silence on points of controversy. In March 1628 the House of Commons again appointed a committee of religion to inquire into the cases of Montagu, Roger Mainwaring, and Cosin.\n\nMontagu still had the strongest supporters at court in Laud and Buckingham himself; and on the death of George Carleton, bishop of Chichester and an opponent, he was appointed to the vacant see. He was elected on 14 July 1628 and received dispensation to hold Petworth with his bishopric. On 22 August Montagu was confirmed in Bow Church. During the ceremony one Jones, a stationer, made objection to the confirmation but the objection was over-ruled as informal; and on 24 August he was consecrated at Croydon, on the same day that news came of Buckingham's assassination. A bitter pamphlet, called \"Anti-Montacutum, an Appeale or Remonstrance of the Orthodox Ministers of the Church of England against Richard Mountague\", was published in 1629 at Edinburgh. The House of Commons again took up the matter, and attempts were made at conciliation, by the issue of the declaration prefixed to the Thirty-nine Articles and printed in the \"Book of Common Prayer\", by a letter from Montagu to Abbot disclaiming Arminianism, by the grant of a special pardon to Montagu, and by the issue of a proclamation suppressing the \"Appello Caesarem\".\n\nIn his diocese Montagu lived at Aldingbourne and Petworth. His process to recover the estate and manor of Selsey, Sussex was decided against him by Robert Heath, now chief justice, in the common pleas, in 1635. He was still engaged in his research into ecclesiastical history, and published several treatises. In 1638 he was at work on a book on the Eucharistic Sacrifice, which he submitted to the approval of Laud. He was also apparently at this time much mixed up in the tortuous negotiations with the papacy which were conducted through Gregorio Panzani; at the same time Montagu was asking licence for his son to visit Rome, and the matter became in the hands of William Prynne a plausible accusation of romanising.\n\nOn the translation of Matthew Wren, bishop of Norwich, to Ely, Montagu was appointed to the vacant see. He was elected on 4 May 1638, and the election received the royal assent on 9 May. He had long been suffering from a quartan ague, as well as gout and kidney stones. He was again attacked in the House of Commons on 23 February 1641 on account of a petition from the inhabitants of St. Peter Mancroft, Norwich, against an inhibition directed by the bishop against Mr. Carter, parson of that parish, and a commission was appointed to consider his offences. Before any further steps were taken, he died on 13 April 1641, and was buried in Norwich Cathedral.\n\nBesides works already mentioned, Montagu wrote:\n\n\n\n"}

The band consists of Matt Berninger (vocals), Aaron Dessner (guitar, piano, keyboards), Bryce Dessner (guitar, piano, keyboards), Scott Devendorf (bass) and Bryan Devendorf (drums).\n\nFounded by Matt Berninger, Aaron Dessner, and Scott and Bryan Devendorf, The National released their self-titled debut album, \"The National\" (2001), on Brassland Records, an independent record label founded by Dessner and his twin brother, Bryce Dessner. Bryce, who had assisted in recording the album, soon joined the band, participating as a full member in the recording of its follow-up, \"Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers\" (2003).\n\nLeaving behind their day jobs, the National signed with Beggars Banquet Records and released their third studio album, \"Alligator\" (2005), to widespread critical acclaim. The band's fourth and fifth studio albums, \"Boxer\" (2007) and \"High Violet\" (2010), increased their exposure significantly. In 2013, the band released its sixth studio album, \"Trouble Will Find Me\", which was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards. In 2017 the band released the album \"Sleep Well Beast\", which won the Grammy award for Best Alternative Music Album at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards. Their eighth studio album, \"I Am Easy to Find\", was released on May 17, 2019.\n\nFour of the band's albums were included on \"NME\"s 2013 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\nMatt Berninger and Scott Devendorf met in 1991 while attending the University of Cincinnati's DAAP college of graphic design program, where they also met Mike Brewer, Casey Reas and Jeff Salem. Together, the five of them formed the lo-fi garage band Nancy, named after Berninger's mother, aspiring to sound like Pavement. The band was together for five years, and released one album, \"Ruther 3429\", on Wife Records before breaking up after Berninger, Devendorf, Reas and Salem moved to Brooklyn.\n\nBryan, Bryce, and Aaron were childhood friends who played in several bands together over the years. When their last effort, Project Nim, broke up in 1998, they joined Matt and Scott in Brooklyn via the Devendorf relationship.\n\nWhen the band was formed in 1999, it was called \"The National\", although the domain name of the band's website is americanmary.com because, according to Matt Berninger, \"[i]t's a song off our first record. We never thought of changing the (website) name, although we should have.\" Several of the members continued to work day jobs, including being involved in New York's dot-com boom, while performing free Sunday night shows regularly at Lower East Side venue Luna Lounge.\n\nTheir first album \"The National\" was eventually released in 2001 on Brassland Records, a label founded by band members Aaron and Bryce Dessner, along with their friend Alec Hanley Bemis. When reviewing the album, Jason MacNeil of \"No Depression\" wrote, \"...The National has created nearly a dozen picture-perfect Americana bar-soaked gems with its debut album. From the opening notes of 'Beautiful Head', the delicate line between polished roots-oriented pop and alt-country has rarely been walked so deliberately with the payoff so favorable.\"\n\nThe National's second album \"Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers\", released in 2003, was the band's first collaboration with record producers Paul Heck and Peter Katis, who would later also produce the band's critically acclaimed albums \"Alligator\" and \"Boxer\". After the release of the album, renowned DJ Bernard Lenoir invited them to perform on his Black Sessions twice on France Inter. Publications such as \"Uncut\" and the \"Chicago Tribune\" named it an album of the year.\n\nIn 2004, they released the \"Cherry Tree\" EP. The EP featured \"All the Wine,\" a song that would appear on their next record. The release of the EP garnered further success and landed them on a successful tour with The Walkmen.\n\nIn the same year, the band quit their day jobs and signed to a new label, Beggars Banquet Records, because the process of running their own label was becoming \"too complicated\".\n\nTheir first album on Beggars Banquet, \"Alligator\", was released in 2005. The album was met with much critical acclaim and featured highly in \"Album of the Year\" charts in the \"Los Angeles Times\", Insound, \"Uncut\", and many other publications. \nThe album allowed the band increased exposure. \"NME\" and Pitchfork Media ranked \"Alligator\" as a top album of the 2000s.\n\n\"Alligator\" brought the band increased attendance at concerts, including sold-out shows at The Troubadour in Los Angeles and Webster Hall in New York. They also played at numerous festivals including the 2006 Pitchfork Music Festival, Reading and Leeds Festivals, Pukkelpop, and more.\n\nTheir fourth album, \"Boxer\", was released on May 22, 2007, and also received widespread critical praise. The album features contributions from various guest artists, including Sufjan Stevens and Doveman. It was voted as the No. 2 best album of the year by Stereogum.com and the No. 1 album of the year by \"Paste\". The song \"Slow Show\" from \"Boxer\" was featured on the NBC series \"Chuck\" and \"Parenthood\", as well as on The CW's \"One Tree Hill\" in its fifth season. The song \"Start a War\" was featured on the international science fiction series \"Defying Gravity\", ABC's \"Brothers and Sisters\", Fox's \"House\", NBC's \"Parenthood\", NBC's \"Friday Night Lights\", Lionsgate film \"Warrior\". The track \"Fake Empire\" was featured in the Season 2 Premiere of the HBO series \"Hung\", also on the 9th episode, season 5 of \"Person of interest\", and on the third episode of season 2 of NBC's \"Chuck\" and in the pilot episode of \"Southland\". An instrumental version of the song was featured in Barack Obama's campaign video \"Signs of Hope and Change\" during his 2008 United States presidential campaign, and the song was also played at the 2008 Democratic National Convention.\n\nOn September 26, 2007, the band performed \"Apartment Story\" on \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\".\n\nIn the summer of 2008, along with Modest Mouse, they opened for R.E.M. on the promotional tour for the R.E.M. album \"Accelerate\". That summer they played many festivals in North America and Europe, including Coachella, Roskilde, Sasquatch, Glastonbury, Haldern Pop, Rock Werchter, Optimus Alive!, Oxegen, Benicàssim, Lowlands, O2 Wireless, T in the Park, All Points West, and Lollapalooza.\n\n\"Boxer\" made numerous \"album of the decade\" lists, including Pitchfork Media, \"Aquarium Drunkard\", \"Paste\", and more.\n\nIn May 2008, the band released their first feature-length documentary film titled \"A Skin, a Night\" on DVD. The film, directed by filmmaker Vincent Moon, documents the lives of the band surrounding the recording of \"Boxer\" and just before a show at the London venue Koko. Along with the release of the DVD was a CD collection of B-sides and rarities titled \"The Virginia EP\". The National's collaboration with Vincent Moon began long before the filming of \"A Skin, a Night\". Vincent Moon discovered the band after the release of their first album and became friends with its members after a show at Paris' La Guinguette Pirate.

He also represented the West Germany national team, winning the FIFA World Cup in 1990.\n\nIn 2005, he was named as a member of the greatest Bayern Munich XI in the club's history.\n\nAugenthaler played generally in the position of central defender or, especially in the later part of his career, libero (sweeper). In his years with Bayern Munich he won the Bundesliga title seven times and the DFB-Pokal three times. In the European Cup he was runner-up in 1982, vs. Aston Villa (0–1) and again in 1987, although he missed the final due to suspension, when Bayern lost 2–1 to FC Porto.\n\nFrom 1984 until the end of his career as player in 1991 Klaus Augenthaler also captained his club side.

There are many environmental elements that affect an individual. Examples of these elements are urbanization, crowding, noise, mass media, technology, and the explosive growth of information.\n\nThere are a wide variety of symptoms that have been found to be associated with sensory overload. These symptoms can occur in both children and adults. Some of these symptoms are:\n\nSensory overload can result from the overstimulation of any of the senses.\n\nSensory overload has been found to be associated with other disorders and conditions such as:\n\nThere are many different ways to treat sensory overload. One way to reduce this tension is to participate in occupational therapy; however, there are many ways for people with symptoms to reduce it themselves. Being able to identify one's own triggers of sensory overload can help reduce, eliminate, or avoid them. Most often the quickest way to ease sensory overload symptoms is to remove oneself from the situation. Deep pressure against the skin combined with proprioceptive input that stimulates the receptors in the joints and ligaments often calms the nervous system. Reducing sensory input such as eliminating distressing sounds and lowering the lights can help. Calming, focusing on music works for some. If a quick break does not relieve the problem, an extended rest is advised. People with sensory processing issues may benefit from a sensory diet of activities and accommodations designed to prevent sensory overload and retrain the brain to process sensory input more typically. It is important in situations of sensory overload to calm oneself and return to a normal level.\n\nThere are three different methods to address sensory overload: avoidance, setting limits, and meditation. The process of avoidance involves creating a more quiet and orderly environment. This includes keeping the noise to a minimum and reducing the sense of clutter. To prevent sensory overload, it is important to rest before big events and focus your attention and energy on one thing at a time. Setting limits involves restricting the amount of time spent on various activities and selecting settings to carefully avoid crowds and noise. One may also limit interactions with specific people to help prevent sensory overload.\n\nIt can be difficult to distinguish and understand information when experiencing sensory overload. Even such meaningless stimuli such as white noise or flickering lights may induce sensory overload. Sensory overload is common among consumers as many corporations compete with each other especially when advertising. Advertisers will use the best colours, words, sounds, textures, designs and much more to get the attention of a customer. This can influence the consumer, as they will be drawn to a product that is more attention grabbing. However, policy makers and advertisers must be aware\nthat too much information or attention-grabbing products can cause sensory overload.\n\nImplications of public policy in regards to information overload have two main assumptions. The assumptions the policymakers have are, first, to assume that consumers have a great deal of processing capacity and a great deal of time to process information. Secondly, consumers can always absorb the information without serious concern about how much information has been presented. As researchers have pointed out, policymakers should better understand the difference between the process and availability of information. This will help decrease the possibility of information overload. In some cases, the time to process such information in a commercial can be 6 out of 30 seconds. This can lead consumers confused and overloaded with such fast-paced information thrown at them. To understand how consumers process information three factors must be analyzed. Factors such as the amount of information given, the source of corrective information and the way in which it is all presented to the consumer. Different types of media have different processing demands. An optimal outcome for policy makers to influence advertisers to try is to present information through a TV commercial stating simple facts about a product and then encourage the audience to check out their website for more details. Therefore, their quick processing time of a commercial was not overloaded with information thus saving the consumer from sensory overload.\n\nConsumers today are forced to learn to cope with overloading and an abundance of information, through the radio, billboards, television, newspapers and much more. Information is everywhere and being thrown at consumers from every angle and direction. Therefore, Naresh K. Malhotra, the author of Information and Sensory Overload presents the following guidelines. First, consumers must try to limit the intake of external information and sensory inputs to avoid sensory overload. This can be done by tuning out irrelevant information presented by the media and marketers to get the attention of the consumer. Second, record important information externally rather than mentally. Information can be easily forgotten mentally once the individual becomes overloaded by their sense. Thus it is recommended for a consumer to write down important information rather than store it mentally. Third, when examining a product, do not overload their senses by examining more than five products at a time. This will lead to confusion and frustration. Fourth, process information where there is less irrelevant information around. This will eliminate external information and sensory distractions such as white noise and other information presented in an environment. Finally, it is important to make consuming a pleasant and relaxed experience. This will help diminish the stress, overwhelming feeling, and experience of sensory overload.\n\nUsing the senses in marketing can be a useful sales tactic. Most commonly, marketers will take advantage of humans four out of five senses to increase the amount of information being presented to the customer. \n\nNot many studies have been done on sensory overload, but one example of a sensory overload study was reported by Lipowski (1975) as part of his research review on the topic that discussed the work done by Japanese researchers at Tohoku University. The Tohoku researchers exposed their subjects to intense visual and auditory stimuli presented randomly in a condition of confinement ranging in duration from three to five hours. Subjects showed heightened and sustained arousal as well as mood changes such as aggression, anxiety, and sadness. These results have helped open the door to further research on sensory overload.\n\nSociologist Georg Simmel contributed to the description of sensory overload in his 1903 essay \"The Metropolis and Mental Life.\" Simmel describes an urban landscape of constant sensory stimuli against which the city-dweller must create a barrier in order to remain sane. For Simmel, the sensory overload of modern urban life depletes the body’s reservoirs of energy, leading, among other things, to a jaded or blasé [blasiert] mentality and a calculating, instrumentalizing approach to others. Simmel's approach can be compared to Freud's writings on Shell shock as well as Walter Benjamin's analysis of \"shock\" and urban life in his 1939 essay \"On Some Motifs in Baudelaire.\"\n\n"}

At the 2006 census, its population was 96,786, in 20,297 families.\n\nYasuj is an industrial city in the Zagros Mountains of southwestern Iran. The term \"Yasuj\" is also used to refer to the entire region.\n\nYasuj has both a sugar processing plant and a coal-burning powerplant that generates electricity for the area.\n\nThe people of Yasuj speak the Luri language.\n\nThe area of Yasuj has been settled since as early as the Bronze Age. Findings include the Martyrs Hills (dating from 3rd millennium BC), the Khosravi Hill from the Achaemenian period, the ancient site of Gerd, the Pataveh bridge, and the Pay-e Chol cemetery. Yasuj is the place where Alexander III of Macedon and his Macedonian forces stormed the \"Persian Gates\" (\"Darvazeh-ye Fars\"), and found a way into the Persian heartland (331 BC).\n\nThe Yasuj Museum, which opened in 2002, displays coins, statues, pottery, and bronze vessels recovered from surrounding archaeological sites.\nYasuj was called Tal-e Khosrow (Khosrow Hill) in the last century.\n\nYasuj has the typical continentally-influenced Mediterranean climate (Köppen \"Csa\") of western Iran, though because of its location in the direct line of rain-bearing winds from the Persian Gulf it is the wettest Iranian city south of the Elburz Mountains with an annual rainfall nine times that of Isfahan and twice that of Kermanshah. The heavy precipitation allows the existence of small glaciers on the highest Zagros peaks – in contrast the Kuhrud Mountains to the east have no glaciers despite being of the same height due to aridity. The long dry season sees only on average of rainfall between June and September, with the wet season extending into October, unlike many other mediterranean climates.\n\nThe economy of Yasuj is based on the following local activities:\n\n\nBy 2014 a new refinery will be constructed by the private sector, at a cost of $2.2 billion. It will produce petrol, gasoil, kerosene, furnace oil, liquefied gas, asphalt, and sulfur.\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}

It is an ester formed from methoxycinnamic acid and 2-ethylhexanol. It is a liquid that is insoluble in water.\n\nIt is primarily used in sunscreens and other cosmetics to absorb UV-B rays from the sun, protecting the skin from damage. It is also used to reduce the appearance of scars.\n\nOften used as an active ingredient in sunscreens combined with oxybenzone and titanium oxide for its use in protection against UV-B rays.\n\nOne study performed in 2000 raised safety concerns about octyl methoxycinnamate by demonstrating toxicity to mouse cells at concentrations lower than typical levels in sunscreens. However, another study concluded that octyl methoxycinnamate and other sun screening agents do not penetrate the outer skin in sufficient concentration to cause any significant toxicity to the underlying human keratinocytes.\nEstrogenic and neurological effects were noted in laboratory animals at concentrations close to those experienced by sunscreen users and were also shown in vitro. Octyl methoxycinnamate has been shown to be light sensitive with a decrease in UV absorption efficiency upon light exposure. This degradation causes formation of the Z-octyl-p-methoxycinnamate from the E-octyl-p-methoxycinnamate. In contrast, the OMC does not show degradation when kept in darkness for extended periods of time.\n\nA study carried out in 2017 by the Research Centre for Toxic Compounds in the Environment at Masaryk University, Czech Republic, indicates that octyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC) may damage human cell DNA. When exposed to sun rays, the spatial arrangement of its molecules changes and isomerisation takes place. While until now only unchanged EHMC has been researched, Massaryk University researchers focused on its isomers and found out that it has a significant genotoxic effect under lab conditions. It means that it may potentially damage human DNA and cause genome mutations which may lead to serious health risks.\n\nConcern about effects on coral reefs resulted in a bill in the state legislature of Hawaii to limit use of sunscreens containing octyl methoxycinnamate and oxybenzone. For the same reasons, the government of Palau signed a law in 2018 (scheduled to come into force in 2020) that restricts the sale and use of sunscreen and skincare products that contain a list of ten different chemicals, including the UV filters octyl methoxycinnamate, oxybenzone and octocrylene, with fines of USD 1000 for retailers who violate the law and the power to confiscate such products from non-commercial users.\n\nOctinoxate contains a stereocenter and a double bond.

{"id": "2308163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308163", "title": "Riss glaciation", "text": "Riss glaciation\n\nThe Riss glaciation, Riss Glaciation, Riss ice age, Riss Ice Age, Riss glacial or Riss Glacial (, ', ' or (obsolete) ') is the second youngest glaciation of the Pleistocene epoch in the traditional, quadripartite glacial classification of the Alps. The literature variously dates it to between about 300,000 to 130,000 years ago and 347,000 to 128,000 years ago. It coincides with the glaciation of North Germany. The name goes back to and who named this cold period after the river in Upper Swabia in their three-volume work ' (\"The Alps in the Ice Age\") published between 1901 and 1909.\n\nThe Riss glaciation was defined by Penck and Brückner as the Lower (\"Niedere\") or Younger Old Moraines and Old Terminal Moraines High Terraces (\"Jüngere Altmoränen und Alt-Endmoränen-Hochterrassen\"). The type locality lies near Biberach an der Riß in the area of the outer northeastern Rhine Glacier. Results gained from over a century of research show that in almost all glacial periods, several ice advances took place. Today it is thought that there were, \"in toto\", at least eight to fifteen ice advances. In the Riss stage, too, there were several advances of the ice sheet, so that it can be divided into interstadials (ice retreats) and stadials (ice advances), and at least one hitherto unnamed warm period.\n\nThe present-day division differs from the original Penck classification. The beginning of the Riss ice age, according to the 2002 Stratigraphic Table of Germany, was the end of the Holstein interglacial (known as the Mindel-Riss interglacial in the Alpine Foreland and corresponding to the \"Samerbe\", \"Thalgut\", \"Praclaux\" and \"La Côte\"). Its end is the start of the Eem interglacial (Riss-Würm interglacial). It is thus roughly contemporaneous with the Saale glaciation of the North German glacial sequence. The Riss is paralleled by MIS 6, 8 and 10, which would therefore place it about 350,000 and 120,000 years ago. Excluded from the Riss glaciation is the so-called Old Riss (\"Ältere Riß\"), the time of the greatest ice advance in the Alpine region: today it is referred to as the Haslach-Mindel complex (in Bavaria and Austria), Hoßkirch complex (in Baden-Württemberg) or Great Glaciation in Switzerland.\n\nThe classification of ice ages in Switzerland varies from that used in the Bavarian and Austrian Alpine Foreland. The glaciation complex between the end of the Holstein and the beginning of the Eem interglacials is referred to as the Penultimate Ice Age and the Great Glaciation. It is divided into two additional interstadials, the so-called Double Holstein Event of Meikirch (\"doppelte Holstein-Vorkommen von Meikirch\"), which is not identical, however, with the Holstein interglacial.\n\nDuring the period of maximum glaciation, ancient man (Homo heidelbergensis – later the Neanderthals) retreated behind the permafrost boundary and, in the warmer periods, spread beyond it to the north and northeast. Not until the Weichsel-Würm ice age did modern Cro-Magnon man settle these regions, in about 40,000 BC.\n\nAt the beginning of the Riss ice age almost all of today's river valleys were created. The glaciation of the Alps, even before the Holstein interglacial and towards the end of the major glaciations, resulted in glaciers advancing in several phases far into the Alpine Foreland, further than all other known ice sheet advances, and the main glaciers had established themselves along today's river valleys. During the Riss, glaciers advanced into the Bavarian and Austrian Alpine Foreland probably four times. The first two advances have not been confirmed with certainty because they are overlaid by the two stadials at the end of the Riss glaciation that extended well to the north.\n\nThe ice sheet advances of the cold period were mostly well beyond the glacial lake of the previous ice sheet. In most areas, the Riss terminal moraines have formed as low embankments, for example in the area of the Inn Glacier, the Isar-Loisach Glacier, the Iller Glacier, and in the area of the western Rhine Glacier. In the type region in Biberach there is a clear, but rather atypical double moraine ridge, also atypical is the double terrace here, which is probably due to heavy erosion as the meltwater runoff moved from the Wellheim dry valley and Altmühl valley into the present day Danube valley, a process that took place during the Riss glaciation. The double ridge of the type region (\"Doppelwallriß\", with an outer and inner ridge) is a result of two superimposed sequences of glacial deposits which indicates that the Riss was subdivided into at least two stadials.\n\nIn the west the Rhône Glacier covered large parts of the Swiss Plateau and reached as far north as the northern Folded Jura and as far south as Lyon. To the northeast, it transitioned without any sharp demarcation into the Linth Glacier and Reuss - Aare Glacier; only the Napf area remaining ice-free. Further to the northeast, the Reuss-Aare Glacier combined with the Rhine glacier. This extended north beyond the present-day River Danube to the area of the Swabian Jura. In Bavaria, the Riss moraines form a little subdivided countryside without bogs and lakes, where they are not covered by the younger deposits of the Würm glaciation. The gravels associated with the Riss moraines form the present high terraces of the Danube tributaries.\n\nDuring the Riss, the Salzach and Dachstein glaciers were somewhat smaller than during the Günz and Mindel glaciations, the latter extending in each case to the Hausruck and Kobernauß Forest ridge (subalpine molasse).\n\n\n"}

Owned by the Univision Local Media subsidiary of Univision Communications, it is the only full-power Spanish-language television station in the state of Ohio. WQHS-DT's studios and transmitter are located on West Ridgewood Drive in suburban Parma.\n\nThe station is available on Charter Spectrum throughout the Cleveland–Akron–Canton market (channel positions vary per locality), as well as on DirecTV and Dish Network channel 61. However, neither WQHS nor Univision's national feed is carried by many independent cable providers in outlying areas of the market, such as MCTV in Massillon and Wooster, Buckeye Broadband in Sandusky, and Armstrong Cable in Medina, Orrville and Ashland. This is likely due to financial demands as the must carry rule would normally apply in these areas.\n\nWQHS is one of two Univision-owned or -affiliated stations, alongside KUNS-TV in Seattle, Washington, located in a media market that borders Canada, although neither are available on cable or satellite providers in that country.\n\nA previous license owned by Kaiser Broadcasting occupied channel 61 as WKBF-TV from January 1968 to April 1975. It was the first actual independent station to sign on in Cleveland, and the first on the UHF dial. Despite some innovative local programming, and an inventory of some popular off-network shows, WKBF struggled for the majority of its existence due to poor revenue growth. The station failed to achieve profitability while competing against rival independent WUAB (channel 43), which signed on nine months after WKBF in September 1968. By 1975, Kaiser Broadcasting and its then-partner Field Communications sold off WKBF's assets to WUAB's owner United Artists Broadcasting, and purchased a minority ownership in the station (which was relinquished when WUAB was sold to Gaylord Broadcasting and when Kaiser fully merged with Field; both of which occurred in 1977).\n\nKaiser then shut channel 61 down and returned the license to the Federal Communications Commission. WKBF was one of two stations in the Kaiser Broadcasting chain to cease operations permanently; the other was Philadelphia station WKBS in 1983.\n\nAfter WKBF ceased operations, rumors abounded concerning potential companies that could file for the UHF channel 61 license in Cleveland, yet none came forward right away. After a few years, the FCC began to accept applications for channel 61 (as a distinctly separate license from WKBF), and Balaban Stations won the license in 1980.\n\nThe current licensed station on UHF channel 61 signed on the air as WCLQ on January 13, 1981. The station's logo was similar to WKBF's design, but with a neon glow effect. As with WKBF, WCLQ originally operated as an independent station; it carried a general entertainment programming format with a mix of classic cartoons, off-network dramas, westerns, sitcoms, and other syndicated programs. The station even revived a character from the old channel 61 (The Ghoul, portrayed by Ron Sweed, the host of a Friday night horror movie showcase) in 1982.\n\nNot unlike similar flailing high-numbered UHF stations at the time, unlike its predecessor, the station was only able to gain profitability due to its partnership with Preview, an early over-the-air scrambled subscription television service similar to other regional over-the-air pay television services that aired movies and local sporting events in the evening and on weekends (or for a much larger portion of the broadcast day in some markets), such as SelecTV in Milwaukee and Philadelphia, or ONTV and Spectrum in Chicago. Preview was discontinued in 1983 and WCLQ was sold to Channel Communications the following year.\n\nIn 1985, WOIO (channel 19) and WBNX-TV (channel 55) both signed on as independents with entertainment formats to create further competition, which took viewers away from WCLQ. WOIO surpassed channel 61 in the ratings immediately and WBNX steadily grew in its own right as an independent by increasing its cable coverage as well as its over-the-air signal coverage. It became apparent that Cleveland was unable to support four independent stations at the same time and as a result, WCLQ began to experience profit losses. It was at this time that WCLQ was dropped from TV Guide listings and cable television lineups in St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada (across Lake Erie from Cleveland).\nAs a result, Channel Communications decided to put WCLQ up for sale in May 1986. Earlier that year, the new owners began running Home Shopping Network programming from midnight to 6 a.m., later expanding that summer to include another block from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. In August, HSN's broadcasting arm Silver King Television bought the station outright, running HSN programming 18 hours a day, while entertainment programming continued to air from 4 to 10 p.m.\n\nOnce the sale was finalized in November 1986, the station's call letters were changed to WQHS (a \"-TV\" suffix was added to the calls in 1992), entertainment programming was completely dropped and WQHS began carrying HSN programs 24 hours a day for the better part of the next 15 years, during which time much of WCLQ's syndicated programming (including sitcoms and cartoons) was picked up by WBNX.\n\nPlans emerged in the late 1990s to convert WQHS-TV back into a general entertainment independent station by 2002, mirroring the local programming-infused format that was already adopted by the company's stations in cities such as Atlanta, Dallas–Fort Worth and Miami; however, USA Broadcasting (owned by USA Networks) decided to sell its television stations in 2000. The Walt Disney Company made a bid to acquire the group, but was outbid by Spanish-language broadcaster Univision Communications.\n\nAs a result, WQHS-TV joined Univision on January 14, 2002 (as one of the few USA Broadcasting stations that was acquired by Univision not to join its secondary network TeleFutura upon its launch). Today, with the absence of affiliates for the other major Spanish networks such as Telemundo, Azteca América and Estrella TV, WQHS continues to serve as the only Spanish-language network-affiliated station in northern Ohio.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nOn April 22, 2013, Univision Communications announced that it had signed an affiliation deal to carry getTV, a classic movie network owned by Sony Pictures Television, that debuted on the digital subchannels of Univision's owned-and-operated stations. On January 27, 2014, WQHS activated 61.3 for getTV, skipping over 61.2 (which eventually picked up UniMas in late 2014). On August 18, 2014, WQHS activated 61.4 for Escape (which would eventually become Court TV Mystery). In September 2019, 61.5 was activated, airing the CBS-owned cooking/DIY/lifestyle oriented Dabl network.\n\nWQHS shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 61, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal continued to broadcasts on its pre-transition UHF channel 34. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 61, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition.\n\nUnlike most Univision stations, WQHS does not have a regular local newscast. A station carries a series of pre-recorded brief news updates during the day titled \"Noticias 61 al minuto\", produced by sister station KMEX-DT in Los Angeles and anchored by Socorro Cruz.\n\n"}
{"id": "2308183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308183", "title": "Pulpitis", "text": "Pulpitis\n\nPulpitis is inflammation of dental pulp tissue. The pulp contains the blood vessels the nerves and connective tissue inside a tooth and provides the tooth’s blood and nutrients. Pulpitis is mainly caused by bacterial infection which itself is a secondary development of caries (tooth decay). It manifests itself in the form of a toothache.\n\nIncreased sensitivity to stimuli, specifically hot and cold, is a common symptom of pulpitis. A prolonged throbbing pain may be associated with the disease. However, pulpitis can also occur without any pain.\n\nReversible pulpitis is characterised by intermittent, brief discomfort initiated by a hot, cold or sweet stimulus. The pain evoked is of short duration and there is no lingering or spontaneous pain. The pain ceases within a short period after removal of the stimulus. With a reversible pulpitis, sleep is usually not affected and no analgesics are necessary.  Usually no apical change is evident on the radiograph. Pulp vitality tests are positive and it is possible to preserve a healthy vital pulp.\n\nIrreversible pulpitis, in contrast, is characterised by a constant severe pain that arises without provocation. Characteristics may include sharp pain upon thermal stimulus, lingering thermal pain, spontaneity and referred pain. Sometimes the pain may be accentuated by postural changes such as lying down or bending over. If a stimulus is applied, the pain persists for minutes or hours after removal of the stimulus. These indicate that the vital inflamed pulp is not capable of healing and it is often indicated for the pulp to be removed as it is too damaged. Sleep may be disturbed and over-the-counter painkillers are often taken in an attempt to provide relief, but are usually ineffective.\n\nPulpitis may be caused by bacteria from dental caries that penetrate through the enamel and dentin to reach the pulp, or it may be mechanical, a result of trauma, such as physical abuse of the tooth from excessive orthodontic force during orthodontic treatment and drilling or thermal insults, including overheating from insufficiently cooled dental drills and use of dental curing lights. More often it is from physical trauma rather than dental treatments.\n\nInflammation is commonly associated with a bacterial infection but can also be due to other insults such as repetitive trauma or in rare cases periodontitis. The inflammation of dental pulp is mainly caused by an opportunistic infection of the pulp by a commensal oral microorganism. To reach the pulp, the most common route of the microorganism is through dental caries as well as from trauma, dentinal cracks and exposed dentin. Exposed dentin gives the microorganisms access to the pulp of the tooth through the dentinal tubules. In the case of penetrating decay, the pulp chamber is no longer sealed off from the environment of the oral cavity.\nWhen the pulp becomes inflamed, pressure begins to build up in the pulp cavity, exerting pressure on the nerve of the tooth and the surrounding tissues. Pressure from inflammation can cause mild to extreme pain, depending upon the severity of the inflammation and the body's response. Unlike other parts of the body where pressure can dissipate through the surrounding soft tissues, the pulp cavity is very different. It is surrounded by dentin, a hard tissue that does not allow for pressure dissipation, so increased blood flow, a hallmark of inflammation, will cause pain.\n\nThe infection can also come from the apical foramen of the root. Cells in the dental pulp trigger an immune response from the invasion of foreign microorganisms. The inflammation of the pulp is a side effect of the immune response and causes pain.\n\nPulpitis can often create so much pressure on the tooth nerve that the individual will have trouble locating the source of the pain, confusing it with neighboring teeth, called referred pain. The pulp cavity inherently provides the body with an immune system response challenge, which makes it very difficult for a bacterial infection to be eliminated.\n\nIf the teeth are denervated, this can lead to irreversible pulpitis, depending on the area, rate of infection, and length of injury. This is why people who have lost their dental innervation have a reduced healing ability and increased rate of tooth injury. Thus, as people age, their gradual loss of innervation leads to pulpitis.\n\nIn the pulp, just as in other areas of the body, inflammation can be present. Inflammation of the pulp does not take place until the bacteria in the decay have reached the pulp. Bacterial products may reach the pulp much earlier and begin the inflammatory response. The inflammation may be acute or chronic because just like other tissues in the body, the pulp will react to irritants with innate and/or adaptive immune responses.\n\nInnate immunity in the pulp is not specific but uses receptors to recognize molecular patterns common to microbes to initiate bacterial killing (phagocytosis). The components of the innate response of the dentin/pulp complex to caries include at least the following six: (1) outward flow of dentinal fluid; (2) odontoblasts; (3) neuropeptides and neurogenic inflammation; (4) innate immune cells, including immature dendritic cells (DCs), natural killer (NK) cells, and T cells, as well as (5) their cytokines and (6) chemokines. Although the first two items are not classic components of innate immunity, they are uniquely involved in the initial inflammatory response to caries.\n\nOdontoblasts, (the cells that form dentin) have cellular processes that extend into dentinal tubules and are the first to encounter the caries bacterial antigens. They express low levels of interleukin 8 (IL-8) and genes related to chemokines and chemokine receptors. The odontoblasts have been shown to attract immature dendritic cells.\n\nDendritic cells (DCs) are a heterogeneous leukocyte (white blood cell) population. DCs in healthy peripheral tissues (steady state) are in an immature state. The cells are capable of sensing microbes as well as antigen capture and processing capabilities. A rapid accumulation of pulpal DCs has been observed beneath cavity preparations, and an increased number of DCs accumulated under caries. Immature DCs are therefore considered to be part of the innate phase of pulpal immune response.\n\nPersistent infection leads to the activation of adaptive immunity. A transition to an adaptive immune response will take place in the dental pulp as the caries and bacteria approach the pulp. Antigens are recognized individually and lines of lymphocytes are developed to produce specific antibodies which attach to the recognized cells and initiate their destruction. Phagocytes remove the remains. B cells and T cells are the major lymphocytes involved.\n\nA variety of cytokines have been observed in the pulp. Patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic irreversible pulpitis have been shown to have an almost 23-fold increase in the cytokine IL-8 in the pulp. Cytokines in the pulp interact with each other. The ultimate effect on pulpal inflammation and healing is dependent upon the integrated actions of these inflammatory mediators.\n\nIn addition to the lymphocytes, macrophages also provide defense against certain intracellular pathogens. Activated macrophages can function as class II antigen-presenting cells, similar to pulpal dendritic and B cells. In addition, activated macrophages secrete many inflammatory mediators.\n\nMacrophages in the pulp become activated after receiving two signals. The first is a priming stimulus and the second is an activating signal. The priming stimulus is secreted by activated T-helper cells. The activating stimulus may include bacterial lipopolysaccharides, muramyl dipeptide, and other chemical mediators.\n\nMacrophages are professional phagocytes in innate immune responses. Activated macrophages are effective killers that eliminate pathogens in both innate and adaptive immune responses, and are also important in tissue homeostasis, through the clearance of senescent cells, and in remodeling and repair of tissue after inflammation. The number of macrophages increases with the progression of caries and is always higher than that of DCs at all stages of the caries invasion.\n\nAccording to the Brännström's hydrodynamic theory, activated nociceptors from fluid movement and other irritants through the patent dentine tubules result in pulp pain. Unmyelinated, slow conducting C-fibers aid in feeling a slowset, burning pain. According to neuronal studies, 70-80% of pulpal axons are unmyelinated. Highly myelinated Aδ-fibers, which allow for fast conduction, are responsible for the sharp, shooting paining.\n\nThus, the stimulus intensities are based on various fibers. Fast-conducting Aβ and Aδ-fibers provide the lowest stimulus intensities (typically referred to as prepain sensations), and those sensations eventually receive higher stimulation levels. The dull aches are associated with C-fibers and slow Aδ-fibers. As inflammation intensifies, the A-fibers are increasingly activated. C-fiber innervation and Aδ-fibers are polymodal receptors that are sensitive to capsaicin and inflammatory mediators.\n\nThe pain mechanisms associated with pulpitis are similar to those of the rest of the body (i.e. receptors, intracellular signaling, transmitters, etc.). The inflammatory mediators act on specific receptors relating to nociceptive neurons, leading to the production of second messengers and activation of phospholipases and protein kinases. The second messengers regulate receptors ion channels that deal with sensitization. The ion channels open based on pain stimuli propagating action potentials in sensory neurons.\n\nIn order for excitability and conduction to occur, voltage-gated sodium channels must be activated. Changes in sodium channel (NaCH) expression occur after inflammatory lesions, which may generate different pain states seen when neuronal fibers are activated. Studies have been done on major NaCh isoforms to examine expression patterns. Nav1.6 nodal accumulations do not vary in size or immunofluorescence staining activity in typical or atypical nodal sites; however, the proportion of typical nodal sites decreases and increase in atypical nodes in painful tooth samples compared to normal tooth samples. Nav1.7 has an increased expression in typical and atypical nodal sites in painful samples. As a result, an increased co-expression of multiple isoforms at demyelinating nodal sites in painful dental pulp. This isoforms of sodium channels may be a main factor in pain sensations due to their production of axonal excitability properties.\n\nNeuropeptides are increasingly being researched for having a role in molecular mechanisms involved with pain, including ion channels and inflammation. Substance P (SP) is a neuropeptide produced by capsaicin neuron cell bodies (localized in trigeminal ganglia and dorsal root) and plays a major role in dental pain and inflammation. Other peptides include cGRP, galanin, somatostatin, and neurokinin A-B. The biological effects of SP are expressed by the binding of specific G protein-coupled NK receptors. Interaction with SP receptors induces vasodilation and allows for plasma extravasation and mastocyte degranulation. SP is highly expressed in dental pulp and dentin. When pain, thermal, and/or chemical stimulation is present, SP production and release increases. Current studies focus on whether controlling Substance P expression may control tooth pain.\n\nIn addition, dental caries is more likely to develop pulpitis due to less time for the dental pulp to react and protect itself by occluding the dentinal tubules. Based on the tooth injury, sensory nerve fibers react to pulpitis by growing terminal branches into the adjacent surviving pulp, which also changes the cytochemical phenotype. This neural growth typically lasts few a few days and function and form is retained. Thus, pain is poorly localized, and the level of pain stemming from pulpitis varies based on severity, quality, duration, onset, trigger.\n\nAs caries invades dentin, the number of permeable dentinal tubules correlates with the degree of pain. Intrapulp pressure have an effect on the sensory nerves of varying diameters: blocking larger diameter Aδ-fibres and activating smaller C-fibers. Under hypoxic environments and pulp degeneration (symptom of pulpitis), C-fibers may still function. Once reparative dentin forms, odontoblasts associated with the dentin change, and the pulpal fibroblasts lose p75 expression, which is a neurotrophin receptor.\n\nPulp sensibility tests are routinely used in the diagnosis of pulpitis. Pulp testing is combined with information taken from history, examination and other special investigations such as radiographs in order to reach a diagnosis. Pulp sensibility tests assess the pulp’s sensory response to a stimulus. There are 3 general types:\n\n\nCold tests: Most commonly, ethyl chloride is sprayed onto a small ball of cotton wool and is applied to the tooth, which produces intense cold. Alternatively, CO2 snow and other refrigerants such as dichlorodifluoromethane (DDM) have been shown to be effective.\n\nHeat tests: Gutta percha can be heated and directly applied to the tooth to produce heat.\n\n\nEPT is based on the stimulation of sensory nerves in the pulp. It does not provide information on vascular supply to the pulp. The probe tip of the test device is placed directly onto the tooth surface and an electrical stimulus is produced. This stimulus causes an ionic change across the neural membrane, inducing an action potential in the myelinated nerves. The threshold of pain is determined by increasing the voltage. A tingling sensation is felt once the voltage reaches the pain threshold. This threshold level varies between patients, and is affected by factors such as age, pain perception, tooth surface conduction and resistance.\n\nThe requirements of an EPT are appropriate application method, careful interpretation of the results, and an appropriate stimulus. EPT must be done with tooth isolation and conduction media. Key factors in pulp testing are the enamel and dentine thickness, and the number of nerve fibers in the underlying the pulp. EPT is not used in patients with orthodontic bands or crowned teeth, as the current may be conducted to adjacent teeth, resulting in false-positive responses. Pulp nerve fibers also respond to lower current intensities and only a small number of pulpal nerves are required to create responses when electrical stimulation is applied. This means that EPT may result in false-positive responses in teeth with pulpal necrosis. Furthermore, as pulpal and periodontal nerve thresholds overlap, the periodontal nerves may give a false indication of tooth sensibility.\n\nPossible explanations for false-positives include:\n\n\nStudies have indicated that there is little correlation between histopathological status of the pulp and clinical information. A negative EPT response showed localized necrosis in 25.7% of cases and 72% of cases. Thus, 97.7% of cases with a negative response to EPT indicated that a root canal treatment should be carried out.\n\n\nOnce the pulp has become inflamed, the tooth can be diagnostically divided into two categories: reversible pulpitis and irreversible pulpitis\n\nThis is the condition where the pulp is inflamed and is actively responding to an irritant. This may include a carious lesion that has not reached the pulp.\n\nSymptoms include transient pain or sensitivity resulting from many stimuli, notably hot, cold, sweet, water and touch. The pulp is still considered to be vital. This means that once the irritant is eliminated, usually by removal of decay and the placement of a restoration, that the pulp will return to its normal, healthy state. When it becomes painful and decayed the tooth may become known as a \"hot tooth\" and local anesthetic may work as well.\n\nThis is the condition where the pulp is irreversibly damaged. The pulp cannot recover from the insult and damage. For example, decay that has reached the pulp of the tooth introduces bacteria into the pulp. The pulp is still alive, but the introduction of bacteria into the pulp will not allow the pulp to heal and it will ultimately result in necrosis, or death, of the pulp tissue.\n\nSymptoms associated with irreversible pulpitis may include dull aching, pain from hot or cold (though cold may actually provide relief) lingering pain after removal of a stimulus, spontaneous pain, or referred pain.\n\nClinical signs may include reduced response to electronic pulp testing and painful response to thermal stimuli. Today electronic pulp testers are rarely used for diagnosis of the reversibility of pulpitis due to their unreliable nature. Instead they should only be used to test the vitality of teeth.\n\nThe pulp of a tooth with irreversible pulpitis may not be left alone to heal. That is at least the general viewpoint of the dental profession, and not every dentist would agree that a dead tooth must be treated. No statistics are known but it is possible to have a trouble-free tooth after irreversible pulpitis, albeit a dead tooth. The tooth may be endodontically treated whereby the pulp is removed and replaced by gutta percha. An alternative is extraction of the tooth. This may be required if there is insufficient coronal tissue remaining for restoration once the root canal therapy has been completed.\n"}

Caulkins won forty-eight national championships and set American records in all four strokes over a range of distances as well as in the individual medley (IM) events, which combine all four strokes over the course of a single race. Her versatility brought Caulkins many titles and awards, and as a result she is considered one of the greatest swimmers of all time. By the time she retired from competitive swimming in 1984, Caulkins had set five world records and sixty-three American records (more than any other American swimmer, male or female).\n\nCaulkins was born in Winona, Minnesota in 1963. She swam for the Westside Victory Swim club and later the Nashville Aquatic Club (NAC) in Nashville, Tennessee, where she was trained by future University of Texas and U.S. Olympic coach Paul Bergen. For her high school education, she attended the all-girls Harpeth Hall School in Nashville. Caulkins' older sister Amy was also a competition swimmer and water polo player.\n\nAs a 9-year-old, Caulkins had been training as a swimmer for a little over a year when she watched the 1972 Munich Olympics on television, and decided that she wanted to swim in the Olympics and win a gold medal. In a 1997 interview, Caulkins credited her Olympic dream as her inspiration and motivation.\n\nThirteen-year-old Caulkins competed in her first U.S. national swimming championships in 1976. A year later, she returned to the 1977 U.S. Short-Course Championships to set U.S. records in the 200-yard and 400-yard individual medley events. She set a third U.S. record while finishing second behind Canadian swimmer Robin Corsiglia in the 100-yard breaststroke.\n\nAt the age of 15, Caulkins won five gold medals and a silver medal at the 1978 World Championships in West Berlin. She won the 200-meter individual medley, the 400-meter individual medley, and the 200-meter butterfly, and was a member of the winning U.S. teams in the 4×100-meter medley relay, and the 4×100-meter freestyle relay. In the process, she set four world records and one American record. Largely as a result of her performance in Berlin, Caulkins won the 1978 James E. Sullivan Award, given by the Amateur Athletic Union in recognition of the most outstanding American amateur athlete of the year. At 15 years old, she was the youngest-ever recipient of the Sullivan Award.\n\nShe followed her World Championship success with a series of dominating finishes in U.S. competition. At the 1979 U.S. Short-Course Championships in East Los Angeles, California, she set five U.S. records in the 100-yard breaststroke, 500-yard freestyle, the 400-yard individual medley, the 200-yard individual medley, and the 100-yard freestyle on the first leg of the 400-yard relay. She also helped her club team, Nashville Aquatic, win the 400-yard medley relay and place second in the 800-yard freestyle relay. Despite setting the new records, however, she was not at her physical best; she was suffering from the after-effects of a viral infection. Three months later, she won four gold medals and two silvers at the 1979 Pan American Games in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\nFollowing her gold-medal performance at the 1978 World Championship, Caulkins was expected to win multiple medals at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, USSR, and qualified to compete in five individual events at the U.S. Olympic Trials, and likely would have been selected as a member of one of the relay teams as well. However, the U.S. Olympic team boycotted the 1980 Games at the behest of U.S. President Jimmy Carter, following the Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan. Caulkins' dream of Olympic gold was deferred by war and politics, so she quietly looked ahead to 1984.\n\nAs an 18-year-old high school senior, she set four American short-course records at the 1981 U.S. Short-Course Championships in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In each of the four events, she bettered her own previously-set American record: the 100-yard breaststroke, 200-yard backstroke, the 200-yard individual medley, and the 400-yard individual medley.\n\nOver the next three years, Caulkins maintained her training regimen while attending the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where she swam for coach Randy Reese's Florida Gators swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) competition from 1982 to 1984. Caulkins followed her older sister Amy to the University of Florida, where Amy was already an established member of the Florida Gators swim team. With Caulkins leading the way as a freshman, the Gators won the NCAA team championship in 1982; the Gators finished second in 1983 and third in 1984. Individually, in three years as a Gator swimmer, she won sixteen NCAA championships and twelve Southeastern Conference (SEC) individual titles, and received twenty-one All-American honors. She was the SEC's Female Swimmer of the Year in 1983 and 1984, and was recognized as the SEC's Female Athlete of the Year in 1984. She was the recipient of the Honda Sports Award for Swimming and Diving for three consecutive years, recognizing her as the outstanding college female swimmer of the year.\n\nAt the 1982 U.S. Short-Course Championships in Gainesville, the 19-year-old again won national championships in the 200-yard backstroke, 400-yard individual medley, the 200-yard individual medley, and the 100-yard breaststroke. With thirty-nine national championships to date, Caulkins surpassed the legendary Johnny Weissmuller's record total of thirty-six.\n\nEven as she continued to win against fellow Americans in 1982 and 1983, however, she was slumping and falling behind her international competition. She set no new international records, and was increasingly frustrated with her own performances. At the 1982 World Championships in Guayaquil, Ecuador, she finished a distant third in both the 200-meter and 400-meter individual medley events against her East German competition, and failed to place in the third event in which she was entered. At the 1983 U.S. Long-Course Championships in Fresno, California, she finished five seconds slower than her own American record in the 400-meter individual medley and finished second behind Mary T. Meagher in the 200-meter butterfly. At the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela, held later the same month, she likewise won her two signature events in the 200-meter and 400-meter individual medley, but did not approach her own personal bests.\n\nAfterward, Caulkins rededicated herself to coach Randy Reese's rigorous training methods. In an international invitational meet of 26 nations held in Austin, Texas in January 1984, she defeated her East German rivals in both individual medley events. At the NCAA national championships later that spring, she won four individual titles in the 200- and 400-yard individual medleys, 100-yard breaststroke, and 200-yard butterfly, and was a member of the Gators' winning relay teams in the 4×100-yard and 4×200-yard freestyle events. She set new NCAA records in three events, and a new American record in the 200-yard individual medley.\n\nAt the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California, Caulkins served as the captain of the U.S. women's swim team, and finally realized her childhood dream of winning an Olympic gold medal. On July 29, she won her first gold medal in the 400-meter individual medley, beating Australian Suzie Landells by over nine seconds. On August 3, she won her second gold medal in the 200-meter individual medley with an Olympic record time of 2:12.64, besting fellow American Nancy Hogshead by over two and a half seconds. And later that same day, she won her third gold medal by swimming the breaststroke leg as a member of the winning U.S. team in the 400-meter medley relay, together with teammates Theresa Andrews (backstroke), Mary T. Meagher (butterfly), and Nancy Hogshead (freestyle). She also finished fourth in the 100-meter breaststroke, one second behind winner Petra van Staveren.\n\nCaulkins ended her competition swimming career having set five world records and sixty-three American records, and having won forty-eight national championship titles.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1984 Olympics, the 21-year-old Caulkins decided to forgo her senior year of NCAA eligibility at the University of Florida to focus on completing her degree requirements, and announced her retirement from competition swimming. She graduated from Florida with her bachelor's degree in broadcasting in 1985, and was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a \"Gator Great.\" Caulkins was inducted into the Florida Sports Hall of Fame in 1983, the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1990, and the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame in 1996.\n\nShe married Mark Stockwell, an Olympic Swimming Medalist from Australia and a fellow University of Florida alumnus, and has lived in Australia since shortly after graduating from the University of Florida. They live in Queensland, Australia with their five children.\n\nCaulkins is now an American-Australian dual citizen. In 2008, she was recognized, under her married name, Tracy Anne Stockwell, \"For service to sport as an administrator and proponent of sporting opportunities for women\" with the Medal of the Order of Australia by the Australian government. After receiving the medal, the American transplant described herself as \"one proud Australian.\"\n\nWomen's 200-meter butterfly\n\nWomen's 200-meter individual medley\n\nWomen's 400-meter individual medley\n\nWomen's 4×100-meter freestyle relay\n\nNote: All record times and locations are sourced to USA Swimming's list of world records.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2308222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308222", "title": "Anuak people", "text": "Anuak people\n\nThe Anuak, also known as the Anyuak, Anywaa Anywaa and Anywaa, are a Luo Nilotic ethnic group inhabiting parts of East Africa. The Anuak belong to the larger Luo family group. Their language is referred to as Dha-anywaa. They are primarily found in villages situated along the banks and rivers of southeastern South Sudan as well as southwestern Ethiopia, especially the Gambela Region. Group members number between 250,000 and 300,000 people worldwide. Many of the Anuak people now follow Christianity. It is one of the first of the Nilotic groups to become almost entirely Christian, the other being the Shilluk (Collo).?\n\nThe Anuak are from the family of Nilotes. They have lived in the area of the Upper Nile for hundreds of years and consider their land to be their tribal land. Hundreds of thousands of Anuak people immigrated to the United States to escape the wars, where they live mostly in Minnesota, which had a refugee resettlement program. \n\nUnlike other Nilotic peoples in the Upper Nile, whose economies are based on raising cattle, the Anuak are herdsmen and farmers. They are believed to have a common origin with their northern neighbors, the Luo and Shilluk. Also, they share a similar language with their neighbors to the south, the Acholi.\n\nThe Luo peoples are scattered all over Eastern Africa, including Sudan and Ethiopia; they identify as a people who have preserved their cultural heritage wherever they reside. The Luo- speaking people of Eastern Africa are found beyond the Sudan and Ethiopia in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and the Congo. Their language(s) and dialects belong to the broader cluster of Nilo-Saharan languages.\n\nThe Gambela region is hot and tropical with rich, fertile, well-watered soil coming from the rivers. Much is carried down from the mountains of the highlands, which has a cooler, drier climate. The differences in geography have caused self-identification by Ethiopians into distinctive categories of \"lowlanders\", such as the Anuak and other indigenous groups in the area, as opposed to the \"highlanders.\" The latter, including the Amhara, Oromo, and Tigrayan ethnicities, comprise the majority of the population of Ethiopia.\n\nThe Anuak and others who live in the lowlands of Gambela complain of racial discrimination and marginalization by other ethnicities in Ethiopia. This has affected the Anuaks' access to education, health care and other basic services, as well as limiting opportunities for development of the area.\n\nThe Anuak of Sudan live in a grassy region that is flat and virtually treeless. During the rainy season, this area floods, so that much of it becomes swampland with various channels of deep water running through it.\n\nThe Anuak people of Ethiopia and Sudan live of a subsistence economy and have a strong dependence on their rivers. They grow their crops among the riverbanks which in turn provides them a stable and efficient supply of food. When the dry season occurs, the Anuak people hunt the animals that are in search of the waterways. When it is not the dry season, they partake in a large amount of fishing. The Anuaks also chose when to migrate their cattle based on which season is occurring (migrate in dry the dry season). The migration of domesticated animals is not as important to them as it is to other cultures because the Anuak people do not have as much livestock as most as they focus more on agriculture. The Anuaks engage in agriculture, hunting, fishing, pastoralism and gathering to meet their economic needs.\n\nThe Anuak villages are very tight-knit with little contact with the outside world. The villages are run by people called Headmen, whose power can easily be removed if deemed unsatisfactory by the people. The ways in which the Anuak people govern themselves are very democratic. The Anuak's tend to not trust outsiders based on past experiences with the Ethiopian Government and also the other tribal groups who share the same land.\n\nThe Anuak Justice Council (AJC) is an umbrella organization for the Anuak that advocates for non-violent solutions to alleged human rights abuses being perpetrated against the Anuak in the Gambela region of Ethiopia by Ethiopian Defense Forces. The AJC's approach to restoring peace, justice and the rule of law to this area is by means of international advocacy, increasing public awareness and utilizing established legal processes.\n\nSince 2005, the AJC filed several complaints against the government of Ethiopia with several international bodies including, International Criminal Court concerning alleged December 2003 atrocities targeting the Anuak in the Gambela Region. However, the government has denied any involvement in the event. Allegedly, several eyewitnesses who were US citizens were in Gambela during the time of killing and testimonies of several international organizations such as the Genocide Watch report \"Today is the day of killing the Anuaks!\" and the International Human Rights Law Clinic's reports submitted to the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. In May, 2004, the BBC reported that 20 members of an illegal armed gang, including their leader, an escaped convict known as \"Major Kut\", were killed by Ethiopian security forces following a shootout in the Gambela region, and that approximately 200 people had been killed in the ethnic violence that began in 2002, ending with the death of Kut.. The December 13, 2003 killing of the Anuak people was alleged to have been sparked by the death of 8 Ethiopia highlanders who were killed by unknown groups. However, the strife did not start in 2003, but earlier on, several groups fighting the government of Ethiopia massacred the Anuaks of Itang in 2002 , the same location where the alleged ambush occurred.\n\nAnuak militants have allegedly attacked Government forces and non-Anuak civilians. In June 2006, the BBC reported that men dressed in military garb attacked passengers on a bus, killing sixteen, as part of the widespread violence that has occurred in the country.\n\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) released a report on March 24, 2005 that documents systematic and widespread atrocities committed against the Anuak by Ethiopian military units and local Ethiopians. HRW indicates that these acts meet the definition of crimes against humanity; however, no one really knows full details of what has occurred.\n\nAccording to Anuak militants, Anuak men (and some women) continue to be subject to arbitrary arrest, beatings, detentions and extrajudicial killings in Ethiopia . Rape of Anuak women is allegedly widespread as part of the wartime atrocities. The Anuak continue to suffer huge problems with basic access to water, health care or clinics, food, and education, just like the rest of Ethiopia. Even though the country currently has one of the fastest-growing economies and GDPs, poverty still exists. Entire generations of Anuak children are unable to attend school, and are growing up, without any formal or informal education at all.\n\nAccording to exiled Anuaks, the Anuak have been the targets of military oppression by Ethiopian governments. Genocide Watch placed the Anuak massacre on its emergency list of ongoing genocides in the world. \"The situation reminds me of Rwanda in 1993, when all the early warning signs were evident but no one paid attention,\" Dr. Gregory Stanton, president of Genocide Watch, said. Various external actors and governments are involved in proxy wars and conflicts in numerous borders in the unstable region of the horn of Africa, including in Gambela, thus ethnic conflicts could possibly spark and resume.\n\n\n"}

It is the only member of the genus \"Urotriorchis\".\n\nThe long-tailed hawk is a distinctively shaped raptor with a very noticeable long, barred tail and is dark grey on its upperparts and chestnut on its underparts with a contrasting white throat and undertail coverts. In flight the white flight feathers on the underwing are heavily barred with dark grey. There is a rare morph which has a grey breast, with a paler grey throat but still has the white undertail coverts. The bill is black, the eyes, cere, legs and feet are yellow. Juveniles are browner, with a white-breasted \"plain\" morph and a \"marked\" morph which has the breast streaked with brown. It has a wingspan of and a total length of , including the tail of . Females are about 15% larger than males. Since the tail comprises about 56% of this raptor's total length, this species ties with the cinereous harrier as the raptor with the longest tail relative to its body size.\n\nIt is a rather vocal bird which is often first detected by the long drawn out screech given by birds perched in the canopy.\n\nThe long-tailed hawk occurs in the tropical rainforests of western and central Africa, from Guinea in the west, along the Gulf of Guinea coast south to northern Angola, east to the southern Central African Republic, northern Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and western Uganda.\n\nThe long-tailed hawk primarily eats squirrels, especially scaly-tailed squirrels, and small birds; it can also hunt chickens in the villages close to the forest. It kills prey by breaking the neck. It has also been known to attack hammer-headed fruit bats. Its strong legs and feet suggest its main prey are mammals. The mating season occurs in July and August, when the pair build a nest on a high tree. Little is known regarding nesting and breeding the young, an adult was seen feeding a fledged juvenile in Sierra Leone in August.\n\nThe generic name \"Urotriorchis\" was coined by Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1874 and combines \"Uro-\", from the Greek \"tail\", and \"triorchis\", a kind of hawk thought to have three testicles—for further details see \"Eutriorchis\". \"Macro-\" is from the Greek for \"long\", so \"macrourus\" means \"long-tailed\", as in the English name.\n"}

Based in Louisville, Kentucky, it manufactures several well known brands throughout the world, including Jack Daniel's, Early Times, Old Forester, Woodford Reserve, Canadian Mist, GlenDronach, BenRiach, Glenglassaugh, Finlandia, Herradura, Korbel, and Chambord. Brown–Forman formerly owned Southern Comfort and Tuaca before selling them off in 2016.\n\nAs of fiscal 2016 the company had sales of $3.08 billion. The roughly 40 members of the Brown family, cousins that are descendants of founder George Garvin Brown, control more than 70% of the voting shares and in 2016 had a net worth of $12.3 billion.\n\nThe company was founded in 1870 by George Garvin Brown, a young pharmaceuticals salesman in Louisville, who had the then-novel idea of selling top-grade whiskey in sealed glass bottles.\n\nIn 2005, the company sold its Lenox division (one of the oldest and most famous manufacturers of fine china in the United States), which had been acquired in 1983, to Department 56 for $USD 160 million. The income generated by the sale was distributed to the shareholders in the form of a one time special dividend.\n\nIn 2006, the company acquired the Chambord liqueur brand (a super-premium black raspberry liqueur produced in France) for $US 255 million.\n\nIn 2007, the company acquired Tequila Herradura, a Mexican company that produces the Casa Herradura tequila brand (a super-premium tequila produced in Mexico) for $US 776 million, while it also sold its Hartman Luggage division (one of the leaders in the travel goods industry and originally a subdivision of Lenox), to Clarion Capitol Partners. One year later, it sold the Bolla and Fontana Candida Italian wine brands to Gruppo Italiano Vini (GIV). The terms of neither sale were disclosed.\n\nIn 2011, the company sold Fetzer Vineyards and associated brands to the Chilean wine producer Viña Concha y Toro S.A. for $US 238 million.\n\nIn 2016, the Southern Comfort and Tuaca brands were sold to Sazerac Company for $543 Million.\n\nIn 2016, Brown–Forman also reached an agreement to purchase The BenRiach Distillery Company Limited for approximately £285 million. The purchase brought GlenDronach, BenRiach, and Glenglassaugh to Brown–Forman's portfolio.\n\nThe company is a sponsor of the Brown–Forman Retailer of the Year awards given by the American Beverage Licensees.\n\nBrown–Forman has two classes of common stock, both of which are traded publicly on the New York Stock Exchange. The Class A shares carry voting privileges and are thinly traded due to control by the Brown family while the Class B shares are non-voting stock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2009, \"Newsweek\" magazine ranked Brown–Forman in their \"Green Rankings\" which examines 500 of the largest corporations on their environmental track record. Brown–Forman was ranked 63rd out of 500 overall, and was ranked 3rd in the food and beverage industry sector.\n\nIn 2011, Brown–Forman was accused of illegally subsidizing its distributors in China, and subsequently delaying payment to them as agreed under contract. The Shanghai Administration for Industry and Commerce fined Brown–Forman 2 million renminbi (US$320,000) for illegal subsidization.\n\n"}

He is currently the host of \"The Sean Salisbury Show\" on SB Nation Radio.\n\nSalisbury was born in Long Beach, California. He attended Orange Glen High School in Escondido, California. During his senior year at Orange Glen, he was a highly recruited quarterback, choosing USC over UCLA, BYU, Stanford, Notre Dame, Cal, Arizona and Arizona State.\n\nSalisbury averaged 26.5 points per game his senior year and was a high school All-American basketball player. UCLA and USC both offered Salisbury basketball scholarships. Salisbury has three children, Dylan, Dodge, and Shea.\n\nSalisbury became USC's starting quarterback midway through the 1982 season, which they ended with a record of 8–3; NCAA sanctions prevented them from playing in a bowl game. In 1983 the Trojans, still under sanctions, fell to a record of 4–6–1, their first losing season in 22 years. Salisbury suffered a season-ending injury early in the 1984 season, but was on the team as USC won the Rose Bowl over Ohio State. In his 1985 senior year, Salisbury was the main quarterback through a 6–5 campaign, but lost the starting job to Rodney Peete before they fell to Alabama in the Aloha Bowl. Salisbury finished his USC career as the school's all-time leader in pass completions (346) and yards gained (4,481), breaking marks previously held by Paul McDonald; both records were later broken by Peete. Salisbury was also second in pass attempts (602) and fourth in touchdowns (25). He also ranked fourth in USC history in total offense (4,127 yards), trailing Charles White, Marcus Allen and Jimmy Jones.\n\nDuring his ten-year career, Salisbury was a member of the Seattle Seahawks, Indianapolis Colts, Minnesota Vikings, San Diego Chargers and Houston Oilers as well as the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League. In 1988, Salisbury led the Winnipeg Blue Bombers to a Grey Cup championship over Matt Dunigan and the BC Lions.\n\nAfter getting his start on the Comedy Central show \"BattleBots\", Salisbury went on to become an NFL analyst on ESPN, appearing on \"SportsCenter\" and \"NFL Live\".\n\nIn 2004, Salisbury was offered a job with the Arizona Cardinals by his former coach and fellow co-worker at ESPN, Dennis Green, to become their new quarterbacks coach. Salisbury pondered for weeks, but eventually declined and stayed on with ESPN.\n\nSalisbury was hired as a consultant for the 2005 remake of \"The Longest Yard\". On the set, Salisbury taught Adam Sandler proper quarterback mechanics, cadences, and footwork. Sandler later offered Salisbury a role in the 2006 film he produced, \"The Benchwarmers\".\n\nOn May 9, 2006, Salisbury began broadcasting on ESPN Radio 1000, Chicago with Steve Rosenbloom. He also did guest spots on the ESPN Classic comedy program \"Cheap Seats\", where he provided his signature breakdowns of the action in a more comedic manner. He has covered for Mike Golic on \"Mike and Mike in the Morning\".\n\nIn 2007, Salisbury's No. 12 football jersey was retired at his alma mater, Orange Glen High School, an honor no other person in school history has ever received. \"I can't believe I'm having my number retired like John Elway, Marcus Allen, Larry Bird or Magic Johnson,\" Salisbury said. \"In my own little world, I will always cherish being the first at my high school to be honored like this.\"\n\nAfter ESPN, Salisbury worked briefly for OPENSports.com and KRLD-FM 105.3 The Fan, the CBS Radio affiliate in Dallas. On September 25, 2009, Salisbury provided the color commentary for the Lingerie Football League (LFL) presentation of Friday Night Football. \n\nOn October 20, 2010, it was announced Salisbury would host a pilot for a sports comedy talk show called Inside Sports: News You Can Almost Trust. The show aired on Versus in January. Producer Mark McClure called the show \"ESPN meets Comedy Central's Daily Show with some SNL skits, too. Sean will be our Jon Stewart.\" After the pilot aired the show was retooled as a more serious \"Inside Sports Unleashed\", which began taping on May 12, 2011.\n\nOn September 9, 2013, Salisbury became part of the Yahoo! Sports Radio network lineup as co-host of \"The War Room\" with John Granato airing from 3:00 pm to 7:00 pm ET daily.\n\nHe has been the host of \"The Sean Salisbury Show\" on beIN Sports since its debut on April 17, 2017.\n"}

Its distribution extends to Maine.\n\nAdult beetles emerge from the soil in the late spring or early summer and begin breeding, and a population may go through one to three generations in a summer.\n\nThe false potato beetle feeds on solanaceous weeds such as horsenettle, \"Solanum carolinense\". It also feeds on other solanaceous plants, such as species of ground cherry or husk tomato, \"Physalis\" spp., and bittersweet, \"Solanum dulcamara\", but no growth and reproduction occurs when feeding on the potato, \"Solanum tuberosum\".\n\n\"L. juncta\" can be easily confused with its close cousin the Colorado potato beetle, \"Leptinotarsa decemlineata\". While the adult false potato beetle has alternating black and white strips on its back, just like the Colorado potato beetle, one of the white strips in the center of each wing cover is missing and replaced by a light brown strip. The eggs are slightly larger and fewer are found in a cluster. The hump-backed larva is similar, but with only one row of dark spots on each side. The two species are apparently incapable of crossbreeding. Of the two, only the Colorado potato beetle is a serious pest.\n\n"}
{"id": "2308363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308363", "title": "Passage Meditation", "text": "Passage Meditation\n\nPassage Meditation is a book by Eknath Easwaran, originally published in 1978 with the title Meditation. The book describes a meditation program, also now commonly referred to as Passage Meditation. Easwaran developed this method of meditation in the 1960s, and first taught it systematically at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nThe program is an eight-point program intended for the \"spiritual growth\" of the practitioner. The first step in the program involves meditating on a text passage, and since the 1990s the method as a whole has come to be known as \"Passage Meditation\" (not Easwaran's term). The book has been frequently reprinted and translated into 14 languages. It is reported that more than 200,000 copies were sold in the period of 1978 to 2001.\n\nThe first edition of the book had the full title \"Meditation; commonsense directions for an uncommon life\" (1978). A second edition in 1991 was subtitled \"a simple eight-point program for translating spiritual ideals into daily life\", and a third, revised edition of the book was published posthumously as \"Passage Meditation; Bringing the Deep Wisdom of the Heart Into Daily Life\" (2008).\n\nA fourth, revised edition was published as \"Passage Meditation – A Complete Spiritual Practice: Train Your Mind and Find a Life that Fulfills\" (2016). The fourth edition included a new part, not contained in earlier editions, with approximately 80 pages of \"Questions and Answers\" to numerous questions about meditation (pp. 182–264).\n\nAll editions of \"Passage Meditation\" contain a chapter dedicated to each of the eight practices or \"points\" of Easwaran's method of meditation. Each edition also contains a preface by the author in which he explains how he discovered the passage meditation method.\n\nMeditating on a passage is the first point in Easwaran's eight point program of Passage Meditation, and he recommends practicing it for 30 minutes each day on first rising. The other seven points are to be woven in at various times throughout the day or week. Each of the book's eight main chapters are dedicated to explaining one of the eight points:\n\n\nMeditation on a passage involves silent, focused repetition during meditation of memorized selections from scriptures of the world and writings of great mystics. According to Easwaran, the practice of meditating on a specific passage of text (Easwaran suggests the Prayer of Saint Francis or Psalm 23 as examples) has the effect of eventually transforming \"character, conduct, and consciousness.\" The term passage is chosen to describe a spiritually-inspired text that one meditates on, during an extended period of time set aside for meditation, as compared to a mantram (or mantra). Easwaran collected an anthology of selections from the world's spiritual texts, God Makes the Rivers to Flow, for use in meditation.\n\nRepetition of a mantram. Easwaran describes a mantram as a short, powerful spiritual formula which can be repeated, at any time during the day or night, to call up the best and deepest in ourselves, and help to slow down, to become more one-pointed, and to put others first.\n\nSlowing Down is an important spiritual discipline. Living faster and faster gives no time for inner reflection or sensitivity to others, making our lives tense, insecure, inefficient, and superficial. Slowing down helps achieve freedom of action, good relations with others, health and vitality, calmness of mind, and the ability to grow.\n\nOne-pointed attention helps to unify consciousness and deepen concentration. Training the mind to give full attention to one thing at a time, whether it is in science or the arts or sports or a profession, is a basic requirement for achieving a goal.\n\nTraining the senses means freeing the mind from the tyranny of likes and dislikes so as to \"live in freedom\", \"live intentionally\"\n\nPutting others first. Dwelling on ourselves builds a wall between ourselves and others. Those who keep thinking about their needs, their wants, their plans, their ideas, cannot help becoming lonely and insecure. As human beings, it is our nature to be part of a whole, to live in a context where personal relationships are supportive and close.\n\nSpiritual Fellowship with people whose companionship is elevating, and working together for a selfless goal without expecting any reward or recognition, augment and enhance the individual's capacities.\n\nEaswaran says that the eight points, though they may at first seem unrelated, are closely linked. \"Quieting your mind in morning meditation, for instance, will help your efforts to slow down at work, and slowing down at work will, in turn, improve your meditation ... Unless you practice all of them, you cannot progress safely and far\".\n\nPassage Meditation does not require adherence to any particular religion or belief.\n\nThe fourth edition (published in 2016) also contains about 80 pages dedicated to answering numerous questions about how to practice the program.\n\nWorkers in professional fields, as well as writers of popular books, have cited or been influenced by the passage meditation program. Sometimes, the passage meditation program has been included among resources for complementary and alternative medicine.\n\nSeveral empirical research studies have examined the effects on health professionals and college undergraduates from receiving training in the Passage Meditation (PM) program. Peer-reviewed research, published in professional psychology and health journals, has shown that following the passage meditation program reduces stress and increases confidence in tasks such as caregiving\n\nThese studies mostly used randomized methods. Like much recent research on meditation (e.g., on mindfulness meditation), research studies on Passage Meditation have neither postulated nor claimed to infer the operation of supernatural or other non-natural, non-psychological processes. Research on Passage Meditation through early 2007 was reviewed in chapter 6 of \"Spirit, science and health: How the spiritual mind fuels physical wellness\".\n\nIn \"Neurology Now\", published by the American Academy of Neurology, the article \"Meditation as Medicine\" states that various well-designed studies show that meditation can increase attention span, sharpen focus, improve memory, and dull the perception of pain, and lists Passage Meditation as a common meditation method.\n\nPassage Meditation has sometimes been integrated into college curricula.\n\nIn 2001, \"Publishers Weekly\" reported that the book \"Meditation\" (later republished in as \"Passage Meditation\") had \"sold more than 200,000 copies since its 1978 debut.\" English editions have been published in the US, the UK, and India.\nNon-English translations of the book have been published in Bulgarian, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Hungarian, Korean, Lithuanian, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovenian, Spanish, and Telugu,\nThe four US editions are:\n\n\nEnglish-language editions have been published in the United Kingdom by Taylor & Francis (1979, , , 237 pages) and in India by Penguin (1996, , , 237 pages), and Jaico (2008, , , 251 pages).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2308370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308370", "title": "List of U.S. security clearance terms", "text": "List of U.S. security clearance terms\n\nSecurity clearance levels are used as part of a method to control access to information that should not be freely available to all personnel.\n\nThe different organizations in the United States Federal Government use different terminology and lettering, as is discussed below.\n\nSecurity clearance levels often appear in employment postings for Defense related jobs, and other jobs involving substantial amounts of responsibility, such as air traffic control or nuclear energy positions. Employers generally prefer to hire people who are already cleared to access classified information at the level needed for a given job or contract, because security clearances can take up to a year to obtain. In general, most employers look for candidates who hold an active Department of Defense (DoD) collateral clearance or a blanket TS/SCI-cleared (Top Secret / Sensitive Compartmented Information) individual who has a counterintelligence (CI), full-scope polygraph (FSP), also known as expanded scope screening (ESS).\n\nSecurity clearances can be issued by many United States of America government agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of State (DOS), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Energy (DoE), the Department of Justice (DoJ), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). DoD issues more than 80% of all clearances. There are three levels of DoD security clearances:\nAdditionally, the United States Department of Energy issues two levels of security clearances:\nDespite the common misconception, a public trust position is not a security clearance, and is not the same as the confidential designation. Certain positions which require access to sensitive information, but not information which is classified, must obtain this designation through a background check. Public Trust Positions can either be moderate-risk or high-risk.\n\nInformation \"above Top Secret\" is either Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) or special access program (SAP) which are phrases used by media. It is not truly \"above\" Top Secret, since there is no clearance higher than Top Secret. SCI information may be either Secret or Top Secret, but in either case it has additional controls on dissemination beyond those associated with the classification level alone. In order to gain SCI Access, one would need to have a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI). Compartments of information are identified by code words. This is one means by which the \"need to know\" principle is formally and automatically enforced. \n\nIn order to have access to material in a particular SCI \"compartment\", the person must first have the clearance level for the material. The SCI designation is an add-on, not a special clearance level. Someone cleared at the SECRET level for some compartment X cannot see material in compartment X that is classified TOP SECRET. But the reverse is not true: a person cleared for TOP SECRET with access to X material can also access SECRET material in compartment X. The codeword flags for SECRET and TOP SECRET material in every compartment are different, and each codeword is classified at the level it protects (the SECRET codeword for a compartment is itself classified SECRET, etc.) \n\nAs long as the holder of a clearance is sponsored, the clearance remains active. If the holder loses sponsorship, the holder is eligible for re-employment with the same clearance for up to 24 months without reinvestigation, after which an update investigation is required.\n\nA Periodic Reinvestigation is typically required every five years for Top Secret and ten years for Secret/Confidential, depending upon the agency. Access to a compartment of information lasts only as long as the person's need to have access to a given category of information.\n\nUnclassified (U) is a valid security description, especially when indicating unclassified information within a document classified at a higher level. For example, the title of a Secret report is often unclassified, and must be marked as such. Material that is classified as Unclassified // For Official Use Only (U//FOUO) is considered between Unclassified and Confidential and may deal with employee data.\n\nFor access to information at a given classification level, individuals must have been granted access by the sponsoring government organization at that or a higher classification level, and have a need to know the information. The government also supports access to SCI and SAPs in which access is determined by need-to-know. These accesses require increased investigative requirements before access is granted.\n\nThe following investigations are used in clearance determinations:\n\nMany other investigative products have been used to grant clearances in the past. While some of them are still used to determine suitability for employment or enlistment, only the above are used to grant clearances.\n\nCertain accesses require persons to undertake one or more polygraph tests:\n\nSensitive compartmented information (SCI) is a type of classified information controlled through formal systems established by the Director of National Intelligence. To access SCI, one must first have a favorable SSBI and be granted SCI eligibility. Because the SSBI is also used to grant collateral top secret eligibility, two are often granted together and written TS/SCI. Access to individual SCI control systems, compartments, and subcompartments may then be granted by the owner of that information. Note that additional investigation or adjudication may be required.\n\nIn general, military personnel and civilian employees (government and contractor) do not publish the individual compartments for which they are cleared. While this information is not classified, specific compartment listings may reveal sensitive information when correlated with an individual's résumé. Therefore, it is sufficient to declare that a candidate possesses a TS/SCI clearance with a polygraph.\n\n"}

He is married and has three children. He lives in Ormond Beach, Florida. He and his sons are partners in Grand Touring Vodka.\n\nSacks has spent most of his career as a research and development (R&D) driver for many NASCAR teams. He won the 1985 Firecracker 400 at Daytona International Speedway acting as an R&D driver for DiGard Motorsports.\n\nEarly in his racing career, Sacks was a successful driver in what is now the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour. Competing from 1980 to 1983, he won 17 races at Stafford Motor Speedway. Nineteen-eighty two was an especially good year for him, as he won the track championship that year, as well as the Spring Sizzler, The Ferrera 100 and the Fall Final]. Greg also won the Dogwood Classic at Martinsville Speedway, the Bud Classic at Oswego Speedway, the Thompson 300 at Thompson International Speedway, the World Series of Asphalt at Thompson Speedway and the Race of Champions at Pocono Raceway.\n\nIn 1983, he made his NASCAR Winston Cup Series debut in the Pepsi 400 at Daytona in the No. 5 car owned and sponsored by his father, Arnie. He only completed nineteen laps until experiencing engine failure, finishing 38th out of 40 cars. Sacks competed in four more events that season, posting a best finish of 17th in the Champion Spark Plug 400 at Michigan International Speedway, the only race he finished that year.\n\nIn 1984, Sacks made a full attempt at the NASCAR Winston Cup Series, once again in a car owned by his father, only now it ran as No. 51. Sacks made 29 out of the 30 races, finished 19th in points and runner-up to Rusty Wallace for the NASCAR Rookie of the Year award. 1985 got off to a rough start for Sacks. After the first four races, his father's team folded.\n\nSeven races later, Sacks was able to drive the No. 49 car owned by 1966 NASCAR Rookie of the Year James Hylton. Before the Firecracker 400, DiGard Motorsports asked Sacks to drive their R&D car. Sacks qualified ninth and defeated pole-sitter Bill Elliott to earn his only NASCAR Winston Cup Series victory. The win was considered to be one of NASCAR's biggest upsets, as Sacks's car was only scheduled to run a set number of laps before going behind the wall to make changes, but his car kept competing for the win, therefore DiGard decided to let Sacks race as normal. After DiGard's regular driver Bobby Allison quit the team days after the race, the team let Sacks finish the season in their regular car. The next year, Sacks found himself running a limited schedule as DiGard slowly went bankrupt.\n\nIn 1987, he signed on to drive the No. 50 Pontiac for the Dingman Brothers, where he struggled with qualifying for each race. Three-quarters of the way through 1988, Sacks left the team to drive for Buddy Baker's team, the No. 88 Oldsmobile. Despite posting two top ten finishes in the first ten races of the 1989 season, Sacks was replaced by rookie Jimmy Spencer. Sacks was unemployed for a brief period, then joined on with Tom Winkle's No. 48 Pontiac for most of the season, joining with Hendrick Motorsports for the Autoworks 500 at Phoenix International Raceway as part of the driving team gathering in-race footage for the \"\"Days of Thunder\"\" movie.\n\nSacks started off 1990 in a familiar situation with no ride, driving part-time for Hendrick's development team. He participated in the Busch Clash at Daytona and at Darlington in the TranSouth 500, driving the No. 46 'City Chevrolet' Lumina \"\"Days of Thunder\"\" movie car. Four races later, Sacks was rewarded with a part-time ride at Hendrick, driving the No. 18 Ultra Slim-Fast Chevrolet, finishing second at Talladega Superspeedway in the Winston 500. After Darrell Waltrip was injured in a practice crash at Daytona, Sacks drove the No. 17 car for three races—the Champion Spark Plug 400, Busch 500, and the Heinz Southern 500, with a best finish of second at Michigan during this three-race stretch. The highlight of his season was winning the pole position at the Pepsi Firecracker 400. Following a crash in practice by teammate Waltrip, NASCAR officials noted that several teams had made modifications, and NASCAR made the teams spot-weld the blocks back into place, causing a loss of power. Trying to make up for lost speed, Sacks caused a 23-car pileup at the end of the first lap, taking out eight cars, including Sacks. No one was seriously hurt in that race, but it gave Sacks a reputation of being an excellent qualifier, as shown in 1989, when he won the pole in just his second Busch Series race. Sacks was signed to a three year deal to drive the #18 for Hendrick and Paul Newman, with backing from Ultra Slim-Fast, but following the season Ultra Slim-Fast pulled out, the team was folded, and Sacks was released. \nSacks started off 1991 at the Daytona 500 driving his own No. 18 car, but crashed early in the race. He ran ten more races that year in the No. 47 Oldsmobile for Derick Close, posting two top-twenty finishes. He started 1992 with Larry Hedrick Motorsports, but suffered injuries in a lap five crash at the Champion Spark Plug 400, and only drove one race for the rest of the season. He moved on to Tri-Star Motorsports in 1993, and finished sixth at the DieHard 500. In 1994, Sacks set the track record at Atlanta when he won the pole. Nineteen-ninety four also marked the second time in his Cup career that he completed the full schedule, piloting the No. 77 Ford owned by D.K. Ulrich. Sacks raced part-time in the Cup and Busch series over the next two years, winning a Busch Series event in a one-race deal for Diamond Ridge Motorsports at Talladega Superspeedway in 1996. The next year, he started out driving the No. 20 Ford for championship owner Harry Ranier, but was soon released as sponsorship funding ended; following his release, he sued the team, claiming breach of contract. Later in the season, he filled in for rookie driver Robby Gordon, who had suffered burns in the Indianapolis 500. After Gordon was released later in the year, Sacks finished the season for the team.\n\nIn 1998, it looked like Sacks had finally found a steady ride, driving the No. 98 Ford for Cale Yarborough. However, on lap 136 of the Texas 500 at Texas Motor Speedway, Sacks lost control of his car and wrecked, suffering life-threatening injuries. He missed the rest of the season.\n\nSacks made his return in 1999 in the Busch Series, but only qualified for one of the several races he attempted. Sacks tried his hand at Winston Cup again in 2000, attempting that year's Daytona 500 in the No. 96 Chevrolet. He did not make the field. After making sporadic races in modifieds, Sacks announced his return to the Winston Cup Series and Busch Series in the summer of 2002, driving the No. 05 Chevy. Sacks teamed with Loren Fossie to form \"Team Franchisit/Sacks Racing\". Originally set to debut at the Brickyard 400, the date was pushed to the fall race at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Nothing was ever heard from the team since, and it is not clear if the team was originally planned as a marketing tool for Franchisit.\n\nIn 2004, Sacks formed Daytona Speed Inc., with Ed Raabe and James Wilsberg. Making its first attempt at Chicagoland Speedway, the team did not make a race until the Pennsylvania 500 the next month. In February 2005, Raabe departed to form his own race team (Chevrolet), leaving all of the (Dodge) Daytona Speed equipment in the care of Sacks. Sacks ran both Pocono races in 2005, and finished 43rd in both of them.\n\nThe team attempted a part-time schedule in 2006, but failed to make the field for any race. In early 2007, an arbitrator forced his sponsor Who's Your Daddy? to pay over a million dollars to Sacks after a contract violation.\n\nSacks was to attempt a partial schedule in the ARCA/ReMAX series in 2008. He tried to qualify for the ARCA race at Daytona but missed the field after posting the 48th best qualifying time.\n\nSacks drove the No. 88 car owned by Dale Earnhardt Jr. in the Nationwide Series Subway Jalapeño 250 on July 2 at Daytona. Sacks finished 21st after qualifying 7th.\n\nSacks and his family, who own Grand Touring Vodka, sponsored JR Motorsports for the 2011 Nationwide Series season.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2308411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308411", "title": "Centennial Beach", "text": "Centennial Beach\n\nCentennial Beach is a public aquatic park located at 500 W. Jackson Avenue in Naperville, Illinois. The Beach is within an abandoned, double quarry alongside the DuPage River. The facility covers almost 6 acres (24,000 m²) of land with a full two acres (8,000 m²) or 6.2 million gallons of open water from Lake Michigan, all tested, re-circulated and chlorinated on site. \n\nAmong its features is a sand beach next to the shallow end of the pool which offers a zero-depth entry. At the zero depth area of the pool, there are 2 large water play features which pour water from about up, and water spouts that shoot up water for children to play in and cool off. The shallow end of the pool goes from to , getting deeper as you walk further into the pool. In the area there are 3 lanes for lap swimmers, where Centennial Beach’s swim team, The Mudrats, practice each weekday morning before open swim hours. \n\nThe shallow end also has a slide that was added in 2008. The shallow end also has an area called the “channel.” This area is right next to the deep end and the diving boards. In the channel there is a pool lift for people who cannot use the ladders to get into the pool, they can be let in on the lift. The deep end of the beach has 2 floating rafts in the middle for swimmers to swim out to. The deep end also has 4 piers on the sides of the deep end for swimmers to sit and relax on without sitting on the walkway. \n\nThe deep end has an NCAA and USS-approved diving complex, which houses two one-meter springboards and one three-meter board. \n\nCentennial beach is open on all non-school days from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Centennial Beach’s open swim hours are 11:00 am – 8:00 pm Monday through Saturday and 11:00 am – 6:00 pm on Sunday. The Beach opens early on Saturdays and Sundays for “Adult Float” which is a time where adults can come in with any sort of floating devices (not allowed during regular open swim time) and swim with them. Adult float is every Saturday and Sunday from 9:00–10:55 am. Every Saturday morning at 7:00 am the Centennial Beach lifeguards train and do drills for 2 hours before the pool opens. In the event of inclement weather, poor conditions, low attendance, or insufficient staffing the manager may close the beach or certain sections of the beach. In mid-August the beach begins to close earlier than usual due to early darkness. \n\nCentennial Beach receives about 2,500 visitors on an average warm summer day. Over the course of a year the beach receives about 155,000. The beach plays host to various athletic events and is known for its nationally competitive lifeguard team.\n\nCentennial Beach has an adjacent skatepark to the west. The skatepark opens at 9:00 AM, and closes at dusk. This facility includes skating elements, such as half-pipes, quarter pipes, fun boxes, rails and more. This skate park is unsupervised, and free of charge for non-motorized skateboards, in-line skates, and scooters. The use of a bicycle can only be used during bike hours at some sport complexes. Any other wheeled or sliding devices will be prohibited from the park. Skate at your own risk.\nCentennial Beach also has a baseball field that is used by the Naperville Little League. Naperville Little League wouldn't be a program if boys and girls ages 7 years of age through 12 years of age weren't on teams. The league a child will play in corresponds with the distract the school they attend too. This complex was made possible by donations and other community groups and was completed in 2005. Recently, added in new bleachers, fencing around the fields, and a new entryway. There will be many parking spots for parents to park in even if they aren't going to Centennial Beach. Near two ball fields there is a park, with a kid area, and a place where older kids can go and wander around. \n\nCentennial Beach has long held some of the most sought after jobs for high school and college students. Jobs include Lifeguards and Guest Services, affectionately referred to by the rest of the staff as \"Cashhousers.\" Not only are there jobs at Centennial Beach, you can work for the Park District to strive to make more positive impacts. If you or someone you know that lives in the area and is passionate about the outdoors, staying on top of things, likes being active, and having fun then check out; part time or full-time jobs in Naperville, Illinois on the Park District website. \n\nCentennial Beach has a strict swimming requirement for the deep end which is blocked off by a pool safety rope. Swimmers who are not passed the 8th grade must be able to past the deep water test every year once in order to be able to swim in the deep water. Those who pass the deep water test receive a wristband, in this case they wear it to ensure they are able to use the diving boards and swim in the fifteen foot deep end. One hundred meters is the total distance a participant must swim, swimming the stroke freestyle.\n\nDeep Water Test Times — 12:50 pm, 2:50 pm, and 5:50 pm\n\nThese are the only set times available for participants who have not passed the 8th grade to take the deep water test. However, if a participant passes the test and acts in ways of struggle a lifeguard at any point of time could remove their wristband. Everyone in the deep end must follow directions, and stay cautious of their surroundings at all times.\n\nEvery weekend there will be an adult float for participants to relax on inner tubes or swim around. The beach allows eighteen years of age and older on Saturday and Sunday from 9am-10:55am to swim during adult swim. However, nobody under the age of eighteen may enter the beach until 11am. This allows for adults to freely swim in the deep end with no distractions; such as, screaming children, loud noises, in this case it will allow adults to relax.\n\nSafety is a major priority at Centennial Beach. Centennial Beach’s licensed guards are trained in CPR, First Aid, and Ellis Lifeguarding. Many Beach guards also have a SCUBA certification. The lifeguards at Centennial Beach have received annual and national recognition for outstanding aquatics safety. The lifeguards are continually ranked among best of all Ellis insured facilities. New applicants to be lifeguards at Centennial Beach begin training in the chilly water in May. Training is extremely vigorous and time consuming. Veteran guards at the Beach are also required to attend pre-season training for the season which begins at the beginning of May. During pre-season training the head-guards and veteran guards teach the new guards CPR, lifeguarding skills, and first-aid. Training six days a week for the whole month of May and continues into June depending on individual applicant's readiness. If by the end of pre-season training the head-guards do not feel that a new applicant guard is ready they will not be given a job as a guard. Training to become a lifeguard at Centennial Beach is very difficult and usually more than 70% of lifeguard applicants do not make it through training.\n\nThe Grill was added to Centennial Beach in 2011. From afar employees in the kitchen can be spotted with neon shirts. It houses a full kitchen, including grills and fryers. Their menu ranges from the classic beach food, burgers and chicken fingers, to healthy choices, including grilled chicken and wraps. Everyone can either pay with card or cash. If a membership card is used, a discount will be applied to the order. There are two main cash registers, but on a really hot day towards the right of the building they open up a third which is hidden and not many people notice it. In this case, having a third register open helps out the line when it becomes super long on busy days.\n\nCentennial Grill Hours:\n\n— Monday-Saturday: 11am-7pm\n\n— Sunday: 11am-6pm\n\nThey also have a secret menu, which only dedicated patrons will know (ask for the beach soda). One may have to be careful on busy days because the lines may become 50 to 60 people long. Every order is well prepared so it will be fresh to the sight.\n\nThe bathhouse was constructed in 1934 using stones from the old Main Street bridge. The bathhouse includes a front office where patrons can pay for memberships or one-time visits to the beach, a manager’s office, showers, lockers, washrooms, changing rooms, and a lower guard house. The old side office of the bathhouse, which was removed after 2011 renovations, used to be used as a concession stand. Anyone who lives in Naperville will receive a discount off their ticket, as for others who aren't in the area they will have to pay full price. Once anyone enters on either side of the entryway, there will be four family restrooms. The men's restroom as you enter will be on the far left, women's restroom will be slightly to the right. Once in the men or woman's restroom, you will notice two drinking fountains, stalls to change into, storage for belongings, washrooms, and showers. The bathhouse had an old side office within which was later removed after 2011 renovations, it was used as a concession stand. Below the bathhouse, down the stairs there will be the guard house, where lifeguards on/off duty will stay and relax before they go out on the beach to watch over families.\n\nCentennial Beach has a swim team for children up to age 18. The mascot for the Beach’s swim team is the Mudrats. The swim team helps to enhance competitive strokes, conditioning, starts, turns, and more. The Mudrats have swim practice each weekday morning in the Centennial Beach lap lanes unless there is bad weather. The Mudrats have practice at Naperville Central High School on Fridays so that they can practice starts and turns since the beach is too shallow to dive into and has dark water so it is more difficult to do turns. Attendance for each swimmer is taken within 5 minutes of each practice. There are a total of 5 practices a week, every swimmer must attend 3 out of 5 in order to qualify to swim at all of the meets. Swim caps and goggles are mandatory for each practice. Swim meets cannot be placed without the dedication of parents. There are up to seventeen opportunities for parents to volunteer and help out the Mudrats swim team. All workers who decide on working a meet must arrive 45 minutes before the start time. A Mudrat could win or lose and the coaches and parents will always strive for them to do their best no matter what. \n\nCentennial Beach was purchased by the Permanent Memorial Committee in 1931. The Committee was appointed by Judge Win Knoch, General Chairman of the Naperville Centennial Celebration, and consisted of 33 residents who each paid $500, a total of $16,500, to purchase the of 1 large and 1 small limestone quarry (later merged to create 1 swimming pool) as well as other land in Downtown Naperville near the DuPage River from the Von Oven estate. The actual development of the pool began in 1932 as a memorial for Naperville’s 100th Anniversary.\nDuring the early years of the beach Naperville residents swam for free and non-residents had to pay 10 cents for children and 35 cents for adults to swim at the pool for the day. On Sundays and holidays the price went up to 50 cents per person. In the beach’s first year it made $6,000.\n\nAccording to a booklet produced by the Naperville Park District in 2006 to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Beach, in the 1930s, income from the Beach was used to finance city projects.\n\nThe limestone bathhouses were completed in 1935. To commemorate the building of the bathhouse in 1935 the Beach held its first water show. More water shows took place at the Beach in the 1940s and 1950s, which served as a culmination of Red Cross summer swimming, water ballet, and diving classes.\n\nCentennial Beach held its first Aquathon event in 1955. This Aquathon included community members doing water skiing demonstrations, high-dive exhibitions and synchronized swimming. Proceeds for this aquathon were donated to the then-new Edward Hospital.\n\nIn 1956 a similar event (to the aquathon) took place at the Beach. The fire department supplied an exciting fountain from the middle raft. The proceeds for this event went to the new fire station.\n\nIn 1969 the District assumed responsibility for Centennial Beach.\n\nIn 1970 the “Save the Beach Committee” was formed, composed 34 community members, to keep the pool from shutting down.\n\nIn 1976 the diving area was re-done, along with a new circulation and chlorination system the next year.\n\nIn 1981, when the Beach celebrated its 50th anniversary the Aquathon was resurrected with similar activities and shows to celebrate the Beach’s earlier years.\nThe aquathon was done again at Centennial Beach on July 8, 2006 for the Beach’s 75th anniversary. The 2006 aquathon included activities like sandcastle and sand burying contests, greased watermelon and innertube races, bozo buckets and tug-of war, kayak demonstrations, scavenger hunts, pier tag tournaments, live music entertainment, cartoonist, face painters, balloon artists, a skate challenge, a water polo tournament, and a variety of unique and entertaining water-based performances for all ages. The aquathon of 2006 was all day, from 11am-8pm.\n\nDuring a significant flood on July 18, 1996, 17 inches of rain caused water levels to rise to the top of the high dive (three meters), contaminating the chlorinated water with river water and storm water. After 2 weeks and 3 days the of waters receded, and the beach was emptied, cleaned and refilled.\n\nFrom 2002–2004 more than 2 million dollars of renovations were put into the beach. Renovations included new concrete decks around the facility, a new circulation system, new lighting and sound systems, new staircases leading to the bathhouses and water play features.\n\nOn April 22, 2006 Centennial Beach held its first “Bottom-Feeder Ball.” The bottom-feeder ball was a birthday party for the Beach’s 75th anniversary. The bottom-feeder ball was a dinner held at the bottom of the empty quarry. The funds from this event were used to purchase the beach’s slide for the shallow end. The bottom-feeder ball began at 3:30 and had a variety of different types of entertainment that did not end until dark. The bottom-feeder ball had numerous posters for guests to look at, T-shirts to embellish, and the Waubonsie Valley High School Jazz Combo and the Naperville North High School Symphonic Orchestra performed. Guests received a 3-course dinner at the ball and the opportunity to see the bottom of the Beach while it was empty.\n"}

The name of the dance (pronounced \"ah-PAHSH\", not \"uh-PATCH-ee\", like the English pronunciation of the Native American tribe) is taken from the term for Parisian underworld of the time.\n\nThe dance is sometimes said to reenact a violent \"discussion\" between a pimp and a prostitute. It includes mock slaps and punches, the man picking up and throwing the woman to the ground, or lifting and carrying her while she struggles or feigns unconsciousness. Thus, the dance shares many features with the theatrical discipline of stage combat. In some examples, the woman may fight back.\n\nIn many films and cartoons depicting the Apache dance, the music traditionally used is \"Valse des Rayons\" from the ballet \"Le Papillon\" by Jacques Offenbach.\n\nIn fin de siècle Paris young members of street gangs were labelled Apaches by the press because of the ferocity of their savagery towards one another, a name taken from the native North American indigenous people, the Apache. In 1908, dancers Maurice Mouvet and Max Dearly began to visit the low bars frequented by Apaches in a search for inspiration for new dances. They formulated the new dance from moves seen there and gave to it the name \"Apache\". Max Dearly first performed it in 1908 in Paris at the Ambassadeurs and Maurice in Ostend at the Kursaal. A short while later, in the summer of 1908, Maurice and his partner Leona performed the dance at Maxim's, and Max Dearly made an even bigger impact with it, partnered with Mistinguett, in the Moulin Rouge show, \"La Revue du Moulin\".\n\nA 1902 Edison movie of two Bowery dancers, Kid Foley and Sailor Lil doing a \"Tough dance\" which is similar in style, survives.\n\nThe \"Valse des rayons\" (also called the \"Valse chaloupée\") from Jacques Offenbach's ballet \"Le Papillon\" was used in a 1908 production at the Moulin Rouge and has become the music most associated with the dance.\n\nIn \"The Mothering Heart\", a 1913 short drama film directed by D. W. Griffith, an Apache dance is shown in a restaurant cabaret.\n\nThe famous French 10-part 7-hour silent film \"Les Vampires\" (1915, re-released on DVD in 2005) about an Apache gang \"Vampires\" contains a number of Apache dance scenes performed by real street Apache dancers, rather than actors. A notable detail is that during part of the waltz the man holds firmly onto the woman's hair, rather than her body.\n\n\"Parisian Love\" (1925) shows Clara Bow as an Apache dancer, with the dance itself being the first scene in the film.\n\nIvor Novello performs an Apache dance in the British silent film \"The Rat\" (1925).\n\nIn \"Hot Heels\" (1928) an Apache dance is performed by Glenn Tryon and Patsy Ruth Miller.\n\nIn the 1929 Mickey Mouse cartoon \"Mickey's Follies\", a rooster and hen perform the dance, interrupting it partway through so the hen can rush to her nest and lay an egg.\n\nIn \"Doughboys\" Buster Keaton in drag dances the woman's part in an Apache dance.\n\nIn \"The Apache Kid\" (1930), a Krazy Kat cartoon, Columbia's male version of Krazy and his girlfriend, Kitty, perform the dance, interrupting it repeatedly so they can puff at cigarettes.\n\nIn Charlie Chaplin's \"City Lights\" (1931) the Tramp sees an Apache dance in a nightclub and, thinking it is real, interrupts it.\n\nThe landmark 1932 Hollywood film musical \"Love Me Tonight\" features the song \"Poor Apache.\"\n\nOlive Oyl, Bluto and Popeye do the Apache in \"Popeye The Sailor 017 - The Dance Contest\" (1934).\n\nIn 1934's Limehouse Blues (film), nightclub owner Harry Young, George Raft, does an Apache dance with his star performer and lover Tu Tuan Anna Mae Wong.\n\nAlso in 1934 the Adagio Dancers, artists Alexis and Dorrano, perform the 'Danse Apache' in a British Pathe short set in a seedy French bar and watched by some \"toffs\".\n\nIn the 1934 Happy Harmonies cartoon \"Toyland Broadcast\", two dolls Apache dance on piano keys, playing the music of \"Valse des rayons\", and ending when the girl doll throws the boy doll off the piano and against a spittoon.\n\nIn the 1935 movie \"Charlie Chan in Paris\", Charlie Chan's agent (played by Dorothy Appleby) is murdered following her performance of an Apache dance.\n\nIn the 1936 film \"The Devil Doll\", a pair of the titular dolls perform an Apache dance to the tune of the \"Valse des rayons\" on a music box.\n\nIn the 1936 British comedy, \"Queen of Hearts\", Gracie Fields performed a satirical version of Apache dance, at one point throwing her male partner through a stage window.\n\nIn the 1937 serial \"Blake of Scotland Yard\" there is an Apache dance sequence set in a café in Paris.\n\nIn the British film \"Okay For Sound\" (1937) The Crazy Gang witness an Apache dance performed by the dancers Lucienne and Ashour in which the female dancer triumphs.\n\nIn the 1937 Silly Symphony \"Woodland Café\" a bad-boy spider and a good-girl fly perform a French Apache dance.\n\nIn the 1938 Jessie Matthews musical, \"Sailing Along\", the actress delivers a comic Apache stage performance with her co-star Jack Whiting.\n\nIn \"You're in the Army Now\" (1941) a comic Apache dance is performed to Offenbach's \"Valse dey rayons.\"\n\nIn \"The Gang's All Here\" (1943) Charlotte Greenwood does a short, comic version of an Apache dance.\n\nIn \"Pin Up Girl\" (1944), Betty Grable, Hermes Pan and Angela Blue perform a musical number dressed as Apache dancers.\n\nIn \"Lake Placid Serenade\" (1944) Everett McGowan & Ruth Mack - performed the Apache dance on Ice skates named \"Cafe de Apache\" produced by Republic Films\n\nIn 1944, the opening scene of \"Die Frau Meiner Träume\" (The Woman of My Dreams), one of the last major Agfacolor musicals produced in Nazi Germany, features the actress-dancer Marika Rökk in an acrobatic Apache dance with two men. The film was extremely popular not only in Germany, but made it to the Soviet film distribution after the war, enjoying similar popularity. The big production finale was taken into the curriculum of the Soviet Film Institute and served as an example of a well crafted musical staging. \nIn the 1946 film, \"The Razor's Edge\", the main characters visit the Rue de Lappe and experience apache dancers in a rather seedy bar. One of the main characters Sophie (portrayed by Ann Baxter) has fallen into alcoholism following the death of her husband and child. Having lost touch with the rest of her friends, they happen upon her at the bar with her 'apache' lover - they dance.\n\nIn the 1947 film \"Crime Doctor's Gamble\", Dr. Robert Ordway (played by Warner Baxter) visits a seedy Parisian cabaret with an Apache dance sequence. The dance ends with the male dancer Don Graham twirling the female dancer Dolores Graham around by her hair.\n\nIn the 1949 comedy film \"Totò Le Mokò\", Antonio Lumaconi (Totò Le Mokò, played by Totò) performs an Apache dance with Flora Torrigiani.\n\nAn episode of \"I Love Lucy\", \"The Adagio\" (1951, season one, episode twelve), revolved around Lucy wanting to learn an Apache dance. In another episode, \"The French Revue\" Fred and Ethel perform an Apache dance in the hopes of starring in an act at the club with a French singer.\n\nIn the movie \"Ma and Pa Kettle on Vacation\" (1952), Marjorie Main, Ma, takes the woman's part in an apache dance in a night club, where she plays the aggressive role, throwing about the hapless male dancer.\n\nApache Dancers Don & Dolores Graham performed the apache dance in \"Phantom of the Rue Morgue\" (1954).\n\nOn October 9, 1955 an Apache dance was performed on The Jack Benny Program entitled \"Massage and Date with Gertrude\". Jack, and his date Gertrude were trying to eat their dinner at a French Nightclub while French Apache dancers kept interrupting their meal. The female dancer actually picked Benny up and tossed him out onto another diner's lap.\n\nAlso in 1955, the movie \"\"Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy\"\" features an apache dance in the scene introducing the title characters, where some of the dance interrupted in a predictably slapstick manner.\n\nAn example of an Apache dance number is seen in Twentieth Century Fox's film \"Can Can\" (1960) starring Frank Sinatra, Shirley MacLaine and Maurice Chevalier. The number is performed by Shirley MacLaine along with five male dancers as they toss and thrash her about. In this version she fights back and eventually \"kills\" all five dancers with a knife.\n\nAn episode of \"The Muppet Show\", (1976, season one, episode five), included a \"French tango\" performed by guest Rita Moreno.\n\nAn Apache dance also figures in the musical \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\" (1968). When Andrew Lloyd Webber set out to create a more than usually fascinating musical mix and included a wide variety of musical genres in this show, he added a very French number. When Joseph's brothers are explaining their impoverished state, after selling Joseph into slavery and experiencing the seven lean years, they sing about \"Those Canaan Days\" reminiscing of better days. Included within that number is an Apache Dance, a brief joyous celebration of what once was and a poignant expression of their regret for their actions.\n\nIn the movie \"Moulin Rouge!\" (2001), \"El Tango de Roxane\" is performed as a tango with Apache elements.\n\nIn the Apocalyptica video \"I Don't Care\" (2007), Apache dance is featured in a scene between Adam Gontier and a woman.\n\nIn the Pink video \"Try\" (2013), the singer and male dancer Colt Prattes can be seen performing an interpretation of the Apache dance choreography by The golden Boyz - R J Durrell and Nick Florez - and aerial choreographer Sebastien Stella.\n\n"}

SLS hold regular Scottish events including SLS Conference in November and SLS Council in February. In addition, its members are often invited to hear major speakers at Labour Party events throughout the year. Glasgow University Labour Club and Edinburgh Labour Students are the two biggest clubs within SLS.\n\nThe organisation was founded as the Organisation of Labour Students (SOLS) in 1970/71, however it is a direct descendant of the Scottish Association of Labour Student Organisations (SALSO) which had existed since 1946. In the 1960s SALSO's UK equivalent, the National Association of Labour Student Organisations (NALSO), was taken over by Trotskyists and disaffiliated from the Labour Party. SALSO, however, successfully resisted any take-over attempts.\n\nSOLS remained famous for its hostility to Trotskyism and its members were key to recovering control of the National Organisation of Labour Students, NOLS, from the Militant tendency in 1975 and the following year SOLS members took the famous \"icepick express\" (a bus with an icepick - the weapon used to kill Leon Trotsky - attached to the front) to that year's NOLS conference at Lancaster University. This incident is recalled in some detail in Michael Crick's book on the Militant tendency. (see Clause Four Group.) Those who were involved included Bill Speirs, Ian Davidson and Dave Smith (NOLS chair).\n\nSLS is made up of affiliated Labour Clubs at universities across Scotland.\n\nSLS has an executive committee, elected on a yearly basis, currently including:\n\n\nAll positions are elected at the annual SLS Conference held in February.\n\nThe SLS committee includes representatives from each of the 4 liberation campaigns recognised by Labour Students: Women's, LGBT+, Disabled Students and Black Minority Ethnic. Each campaign is autonomous and hold events and discussions designed at highlighting issues relevant to them to the wider Labour Students movement.\n\nSLS members are involved in election campaigning in Scotland and across the UK, and the organisation mobilises its members to take part in campaigns in marginal seats across the country.\n\nIn addition to this, for the first time in 2007/08 SLS ran its own issue-based priority campaign. 'Changing Perceptions - Homelessness' intended to challenge the perception young people have of the homeless in Scotland.\n\nIn 2008 SLS ran a Pro Choice Lobbying Campaign against attempts during the passage of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill by Conservative Party MP Nadine Dorries to reduce the upper limit for abortions to 20 weeks from the current 24 weeks of pregnancy. Her amendment was defeated by 332 votes to 190, with a separate 22-week limit opposed by 304 votes to 233 - with MPs continuing to support the 24-week limit.\n\nSLS are also actively involved in opposing the Scottish National Party plans to introduce a Local Income Tax which SLS claim would hit students who have to work to support themselves while studying.\n\nAs of 2014 SLS officially supports the return of the post-study work visa and free education.\n\nThe SLS priority campaign for 2019/20 is the unionisation of workers in student unions across Scotland.\n\n1967: Robin Cook \n1976: Robin Wales <br>\n1978: David Smith \n1979: Margaret Curran \n1980: John Boothman \n1981: Geoff Norris <br>\n1982: Paul Robertson\n1984: Sarah Boyack \n1985: Susan Deacon\n1986: Pat McFadden\n1987: Paul Greatrix\n1988: Billy Halliday\n1992: Jason Wassell \n1994: Joanne Milligan \n1997: Gregg McClymont \n1998: Alex Foulkes \n2001: Blair McDougall \n2002: Blair McDougall* \n2002: Gemma Doyle & John Woodcock\n2003: Adam Hug \n2004: Neil Bibby \n2005: Kenny Young \n2006: Kenny Young \n2007: Victoria Jamieson \n2008: Jillian Merchant \n2009: Dean Carlin \n2010: Ross MacRae \n2011: Ross MacRae \n2011: Mary Roberts \n2012: Lewis Miller \n2013: Stephen Donnelly \n2014: Oliver Milne \n2015: Erin Mulhatton \n2016: Pippa Weaver \n2017: Kate Shaw Nelson \n2018: Kirsten Muat \n2019: Andrew Wilson (resigned mid-term) \n2019: Mariam Shaaban (elected following Andrew Wilson's resignation)\n\nNote: Blair McDougall served two terms because the Youth and Student Conference was cancelled following the death of Scotland's First Minister, Donald Dewar.\n\n"}

It has played an important role in the calibration of the Cepheid variable period-luminosity relation for estimating distances. Other than the Magellanic Clouds, it is the only Local Group dwarf irregular galaxy where RR Lyrae-type variables have been observed; this factor, along with an unusually low abundance of interstellar dust both within IC 1613 and along the line of sight enable especially accurate distance estimates.,\n\nIn 1999, Cole et al. used the Hubble Space Telescope to find that the dominant population of this galaxy has an age of ~7 Gyr. Using its Hess diagram, they found that its evolutionary history may be similar to that of the Pegasus Dwarf Irregular Galaxy. Both galaxies are classified as Ir V in the DDO system. Also in 1999, Antonello et al. found five cepheids of Population II in IC 1613, giving self-evident support for the existence of a very old stellar population component of IC 1613.

{"id": "2308429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308429", "title": "EuroSpeedway Lausitz", "text": "EuroSpeedway Lausitz\n\nThe EuroSpeedway Lausitz is a race track located near Klettwitz (a civil parish of Schipkau, Oberspreewald-Lausitz district) in the state of Brandenburg in northeast Germany, near the borders of Poland and the Czech Republic. It was originally named Lausitzring as it is located in the region the Germans call Lausitz (Lusatia), but was renamed \"EuroSpeedway Lausitz\" for better international communication. The EuroSpeedway has been in use for motor racing since 2000. Among other series, DTM (German Touring Car Championship) and Superbike World Championship take place there annually.\n\nThe EuroSpeedway has a feature which is unique in continental Europe: a high-speed oval race track, as used in the United States by NASCAR and IndyCar. The 3.2 km (2 mi) tri-oval (similar to Pocono Raceway) was used twice in 2001 and 2003 by open seater CART races named \"German 500\" (won by Kenny Bräck and Sébastien Bourdais), plus a few British SCSA races. In 2005 and 2006, the German Formula Three Championship held races at the oval, with a pole position lap average speed of 251.761 km/h and a race average of 228.931 km/h.\n\nAs far back as 1986, in the former socialist East Germany, it was planned to convert one of the huge open coal mine pits into a race track. In the late 1990s, this idea was taken up again in order to build a replacement for the AVUS in Berlin.\n\nWinding in the infield of the high-speed tri-oval, there is a regular road race track for automobile and motorbike racing, using various track configurations up to roughly 4,500 m. The stands around the tri-oval have a capacity of 120,000, while the huge main grandstands have 25,000 seats, and unlike many circuits, the entire circuit can be seen from the main grandstand. Also a test oval with long straights and steeply banked corners is located next to the track. All tracks can be connected to form an 11 km long endurance racing course, but this option was not yet used for a major event, but as a test track capability.\n\nLike all modern tracks, the EuroSpeedway was built to the highest possible safety standards. However, in its first year of operation there were three serious accidents at the track. On 26 April 2001 former Formula One driver Michele Alboreto was killed while testing an Audi R8 Le Mans Prototype racecar. On 3 May the same year a track marshal was killed when he was hit by a touring car during a test session. On 15 September 2001 Alex Zanardi, two-time champion of the American CART series, lost both his legs in an accident on the venue's oval.\n\nThe official EuroSpeedway anthem \"Speed Kings\" was recorded by the veteran East German band Puhdys in 2000.\n\nThe last concert of German hard rock band Böhse Onkelz took place on 17 and 18 June 2005 at the EuroSpeedway Lausitz under the name Vaya Con Tioz, in front of approximately 120,000. It was the biggest open air show by a German band ever.\n\nOn October 9, 2005, EuroSpeedway played host to the A1 Grand Prix series on its road course. The fastest lap of the meeting by Frenchman Nicolas Lapierre was 0.45 seconds slower than the lap record for the 4.345 km circuit held by Heikki Kovalainen.\n\nEuroSpeedway played host to Round 6 of the 2010 Red Bull Air Race World Championship. As the last two events of the 2010 Championship (Rounds 7 and 8) were cancelled, the 2011 series was cancelled as well. The series then suffered an overall three-year hiatus before finally returning in late February 2014, September 2016 and September 2017.\n\nThe circuit will close to the public following the conclusion of the 2017 racing season due to Dekra purchasing the circuit to run it as a testing ground for road car innovations. However, the DTM and Red Bull Air Race World Championship will continue to host events at the venue in 2018.\n\nOn November 1, 2017 the DEKRA acquired the EuroSpeedway Lausitz as a test site, especially for autonomous driving. In April 2019 test and verification of communication elements took place on the EuroSpeedway Lausitz. Participants were Ford, Samsung, Vodafone, Huawei, LG Electronics and others. Topics were communication matters.\n\nDEKRA organised also an Open-air festival, that will take place in May 2019\n\nComplementary racing events, such as DTM are on the agenda.\n\n\n"}

It was acquired by Porsche Engineering in 2012 from its former owners, Prototipo SpA. Porsche now call the site Nardò Technical Center.\n\nThe track is long and is round, has four lanes for cars and motorcycles totaling in width and has a separate inner ring for trucks at a width of . In the cars/motorcycle ring the lanes are banked at such a degree that a driver in the outer most lane doesn't need to turn the wheel while driving at speeds of up to . In essence, at the so-called neutral speed which is different for the four lanes, one can drive as if in a straight lane. However extremely fast cars still require the steering wheel to be turned when going faster than the maximum neutral speed. For example the Koenigsegg CCR which set a speed record for a production car at the Nardò Ring did so with the steering wheel at a 30° angle. This speed record has since been beaten by the Bugatti Veyron at Volkswagen Group's private Ehra-Lessien straight line test track in Germany, and hence the CCR only holds the speed record for the Nardò Ring. In the process of fighting a turn as needed when going faster than the neutral speed quite a bit of potential top speed is lost and hence a fast car will go faster in a straight line than what is possible on the Nardó Ring. Even at the neutral speed, in a banked turn a car runs a bit heavier than it would in a straight line, since the downforce created by the banking increases the rolling resistance on the tires. There has been one fatality at the ring.\n\nThe neutral speed for the four car/motorcycle lanes are respectively:\nDuring regular weekly working activity the maximum speed allowed on the circular track is . Higher speeds are only allowed at times when a client gets the track for its exclusive use.\n\nThe neutral speed for the truck ring is between and over the width of the track, highest in the outer most part of the lane.\n\nThe plant also includes other tracks; the most important is 6.222 km handling circuit, completely inside the circular one. It is characterized by a long main straight and sixteen curves of different radius and variable lateral slope. It can provide useful results for durability, reliability, vehicle dynamics and tire tests of both cars and motorbikes.\n\nThe track was featured in British TV series \"Top Gear\" in the series 18 opener, when Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May drove in a Lamborghini Aventador, a Noble M600 and a McLaren MP4-12C, respectively, to see who could reach the highest speed. The track had previously been featured in a 1992 episode of the show when footage of the Jaguar XJ220 been driven by Martin Brundle was shown as the car's top speed was tested.\n\n\nDuring one of the first secret speed tests on a Bugatti Veyron prototype, driven by Loris Bicocchi, one of the wheels exploded carrying the fender with it. The fender raised and brought the front hood with it which collapsed and smashed the windshield causing the car to lose control and slamming into the guard rail at a speed of 398 km/h.\n\nAlthough the car had broken brakes, Loris managed to save himself with only minor injuries by braking the car by crawling on the guard rail.\n\nLoris received an invoice from the Nardò Technical Center where they said he damaged 1800 meters of guardrail. Bugatti then took charge of any expenditure.\n\n"}

He earned a BSc and MSc in physics at the Technion, and a PhD at Tel Aviv University. His specializations are spectroscopy of super cold molecules, molecular clusters and cluster impact chemistry, and the quantum properties of helium clusters. He then worked as a scientist at the Negev Nuclear Research Center near Dimona. He was officially a soldier in the Israel Defense Forces during his work as a nuclear scientist, and eventually reached the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. In 1968 he abandoned his job at the reactor and joined Lekem, an Israeli intelligence agency responsible for collecting scientific and technical information from abroad.\n\nIn May 1981, Even leaked the news of preparations to carry out \"Operation Opera\" to opposition leader Shimon Peres. Peres subsequently wrote a letter of protest to Prime Minister Menachem Begin, and the operation was delayed for a month.\n\nIn 1993, Even participated in the first Knesset hearing on gays and lesbians, and revealed that the IDF had dismissed him and revoked his security clearance after it discovered he was gay. His testimony led to Yitzhak Rabin's government changing the law and regulations to allow homosexuals to serve in the army in any position, including one requiring a high security clearance. In 1996, after Even's employer, Tel Aviv University, refused his then-partner, Amit Kama, spousal rights equal to those it granted to the spouses of staff in heterosexual marriages, he sued the university with help from the Association for Civil Rights in Israel. Even won the case, setting a legal precedent.\n\nIn 2004, Even and Kama married in Canada. On 10 March 2009, the Family Court ruled that Even and Kama could legally adopt their 30-year-old foster son, Yossi Even-Kama, making them the first same-sex male couple in Israel whose right of adoption was legally acknowledged.\n\nIn December 2012 Even set yet another legal precedent by divorcing Kama.

Bistros are defined mostly by the foods they serve.

Landlords could supplement their income by opening their kitchen to the paying public. Menus were built around foods that were simple, could be prepared in quantity and would keep over time.

The first recorded use of the word appears in 1884. A popular folk etymology of the word claims that it originated among Russian troops who occupied Paris following the Napoleonic Wars (from быстро, \"quickly\"), which was allegedly shouted by Russian officers or Cossacks who wanted to be served quickly.

The game was won 27–22 and France went on to win the tournament with a Grand Slam. He played a starring role in the 1999 and 2003 Rugby World Cups, playing in all France’s matches in both tournaments. The highlight of his career was probably the 1999 Rugby World Cup final, where he ended on the losing side as France were beaten 35–12. He also played a barnstorming role in the 1999 semi-final defeat of the All Blacks. He is only one of two French forwards to have participated in four Grand Slam-winning teams.\n\nHe was a regular member of Bernard Laporte’s squads, playing in all France's matches in the 2004 Six Nations Championship. Magne played in the mid-year Tests against and but missed the November internationals through injury. His last international appearances were against the All Blacks during France's mid-year tour to New Zealand in June 2007. He was not selected in the French squad for the 2007 Rugby World Cup; he was placed on the reserve list but was not called upon.\n\nIn June 2005, Magne signed a two-year contract with London Irish. At the end of his contract, in 2007, he returned to France and took up a coaching position with his former club, CA Brive. On 1 June 2008 Magne declared that he won't be the coach for the next season.\n\nOn 9 November 2009 the Greek Rugby Federation announced that Magne would be taking over as the new coach of the Greece national team.\n\n"}

{"id": "2308513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308513", "title": "Joseph Arch", "text": "Joseph Arch\n\nJoseph Arch (10 November 1826 – 12 February 1919) was an English politician, born in Barford, Warwickshire who played a key role in unionising agricultural workers and in championing their welfare. Following their enfranchisement, he became a Member of Parliament.\n\nJoseph Arch came from a family that had lived in the Warwickshire village of Barford for three generations and had owned their own cottage there since the 18th century. He started work at the age of nine as a crow-scarer, working 12 hours a day. Afterwards he became a plough-boy, progressing to mastery of all-round skills, which enabled him to move around the Midlands and South Wales, earning a reasonable wage. At the same time he observed the terrible conditions in which the majority of agricultural labours lived. These were later described by the Countess of Warwick in the introduction she wrote to his autobiography.\n\nReturning home, Arch married in 1847 and eventually had seven children. He also became a Primitive Methodist preacher but was discriminated against in the village by the parson and his wife, with whom his family had always been at odds. During this period he educated himself politically from old newspapers and became a supporter of Liberalism. It was therefore to him as a well-respected and experienced agricultural worker, that his destitute fellow workers eventually turned for help in their fight for a living wage. Called to address an initial meeting held on 7 February in the Stag's Head public house in Wellesbourne, Arch had been expecting an attendance of fewer than thirty. Instead, he found on his arrival that over 2,000 agricultural labourers from all the surrounding area had arrived to hear him speak. The meeting was therefore held under a large chestnut tree opposite on a dark, wet, winter night, with the labourers holding flickering lanterns on bean poles to illuminate the proceedings.\n\nAfter further meetings, it was agreed to elect a committee, which met at the old farmhouse of John Lewis in Wellesbourne. Then on Good Friday, 29 March 1872, farm workers from all parts of South Warwickshire met in Leamington to form the Warwickshire Agricultural Labourers Union and after agitation up and down the country, the National Agricultural Labourers' Union was established on 29 May with Arch as its president. Following the withdrawal of their labour, when farmers and landowners found their reprisals were no longer effective, there was a temporary rise in the workers' wages, whereupon they ceased to organise. Later lock-outs of union members by farm owners became widespread and the union finally collapsed in 1896, although it was replaced a decade later by the National Union of Agricultural and Allied Workers in 1906.\n\nDuring the high point of the union agitation, Arch was identified with the popular cause and many agricultural labourers would display his portrait in their homes. He also became the subject of such rallying songs as\nIn 1873 he was invited over by the Canadian government and examined the suitability of the country for British emigration. Impressed by his report, during the next few years his Union helped over 40,000 farm labourers and their families to emigrate there and to Australia.\n\nArch also turned to agitating for the widening of the voting franchise, which until then only included property owners, and this resulted in the passing of the 1884 Parliamentary Reform Act. In the ensuing 1885 General Election, Arch was returned as the Liberal Party MP for North West Norfolk, the first agricultural labourer to enter the House of Commons. Losing his seat with William Gladstone’s defeat in June 1886, he was re-elected to the same constituency in 1892, when he was one of twelve labouring class MPs in parliament. Though he was appointed as a member of the Royal Commission on the Aged Poor in 1893, he seldom spoke and his former supporters came to perceive him as pompous and out of touch. Now they sang about him\n\nIn 1898, Arch published a pugnacious and opinionated autobiography, upon which \"The Spectator\" commented at the start of its long review that \"One cannot help wishing that this book were more of an autobiography, and less of a polemic against Mr. Arch's adversaries, political and social. Retiring from Parliament before the 1900 General Election, Arch returned to his home in Barford, where he continued to live until his death nineteen years later.\n\nThe old ‘Wellesbourne Tree’ died in 1948 but the spot was marked by a commemorative stone at the old meeting place, now renamed Chestnut Square. In 1952, the National Union of Agricultural Workers erected a bus shelter there and set up inside it a commemorative plaque which still remains. A replacement tree was also planted where every year union representatives once gathered on 7 February and then went on to Barford to lay a wreath upon Arch's grave. Though the unions no longer do this, the Wellesbourne Action Group organises a walk from Barford to Wellesbourne in June each year along the footpath known as the Joseph Arch Way. There is now also a Joseph Arch Road in the village which runs off the A439 roundabout, while in Barford the old coaching inn has been renamed the Joseph Arch pub.\n\nThe Museum of English Rural Life has an archive with holdings relating to Arch which include personal diaries and ledgers and the Union collecting boxes. There are also curious plaster casts of his hands and wrists (Object number, 75/16/1-2).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2308519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308519", "title": "Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord", "text": "Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord\n\nWizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord is the first game in the \"Wizardry\" series of role-playing video games. It was developed by Andrew Greenberg and Robert Woodhead. In 1980, Norman Sirotek formed Sir-Tech Software, Inc. and launched a Beta version of the product at the 1980 Boston Computer Convention. The final version of the game was released in 1981.\n\nThe game was one of the first Dungeons & Dragons-style role-playing games to be written for computer play, and the first such game to offer color graphics. It was also the first true party-based role-playing video game.\n\nThe game ended up as the first of a trilogy that also included \"\" and \"\".\n\nStarting in the town, which is represented only as a text-based menu, the player creates a party of up to six characters from an assortment of five possible races (Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes, Hobbits), three alignments (Good, Neutral, Evil), and four basic classes (Fighter, Priest, Mage, Thief), with four elite classes (Bishop: priest and mage spells; Samurai: fighter with mage spells; Lord: fighter with priest spells, and Ninja: fighter with thief abilities) unlocked once the characters have progressed sufficiently. Good and evil characters normally cannot be assigned to the same party.\n\nAfter characters are equipped with basic armor and weaponry, the party descends into the dungeon below Trebor's castle. This consists of a maze of ten levels, each progressively more challenging than the last. Classes have multiple spells, each with seven levels, that characters learn as they advance.\n\nThe style of play employed in this game has come to be termed a dungeon crawl. The goal, as in most subsequent role-playing video games, is to find treasure including ever more potent items, gain levels of experience by killing monsters, then face the evil arch-wizard Werdna on the bottom level and retrieve a powerful amulet. The goal of most levels is to find the elevator or stairs going down to the next level without being killed in the process.\nThe graphics of the original game are extremely simple by today's standards; most of the screen is occupied by text, with about 10% devoted to a first-person view of the dungeon maze using high-resolution line graphics. By the standards of the day, however, the graphics improved on the text-only games that had been far more common. When monsters are encountered, the dungeon maze disappears, replaced by a picture of one of the monsters. Combat is against from 1 to 4 groups of monsters. The game's lack of an automap feature, which had not been invented at the time of its release, practically forces the player to draw the map for each level on graph paper (included in the box) as they walk through the 20x20 dungeon maze, step by step – failing to do this often results in becoming permanently lost, as there are many locations in the maze that have a permanent \"Darkness\" spell upon the square (making the player walk blindly) or a \"Teleport\" spell sending the player to a new location. A magic spell can be used to determine the current location of the party, and at higher levels there is a teleport spell that can be used to quickly transition between the maze levels. Care is necessary when teleporting as the player must enter both the level and coordinates to teleport to (the number of steps north, south, east, or west from his current location) and it is easily possible to land in a trap or solid stone, ending the game. The original releases of Wizardry also do not announce that the player has teleported and play resumes as if one step forward was taken.\n\nThe game has unforgiving difficulty as players cannot save their progress within the dungeon; they must exit the dungeon first. In the event of a total party kill, play cannot be resumed; however, a new party may recover the bodies and items of dead adventurers. Later Wizardry games made it easier by restarting at the point in the dungeon where the characters died. It can take hundreds of hours to finish the game.\n\nWizardry saves the player's party and game progress onto a scenario disk. After booting, a new one may be created with a blank floppy disk or an existing one used. Completion of \"Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord\" is necessary to play the sequels Wizardry II and III since they require the characters from the first game to be imported from a scenario disk.\n\nA series of exploits that involves the identification ability of Bishops allows characters to gain massive experience points and gold by attempting to Identify an item in a non-existent equipment slot. According to co-author Robert Woodhead, these cheats were actually a bug caused by the game's lack of bounds-checking, which was disabled to fit within 48K of RAM. When the IBM PC version of the game was released, the bug was declared to be a feature and deliberately included.\n\nBecause the Apple ][ computer was 5 1/4\" floppy based, the game was saved to slow data rate floppy disk. If something bad happened to the adventuring party, e.g. the entire party being killed by evil ninjas, the player could quickly open the floppy drive door, disengaging the write head from the disk as it attempted to save the results of the recent negative event. This would result in players being marked *LOST*. The game would then usually allow these to be recovered and restored to the Inn at the castle. While not foolproof, the alternative of a character being dead, made this hardware hack worth attempting to get a \"do over.\"\n\nAndrew Greenberg, then a Cornell University student, began the project's development in 1978, and the game was in an early playable state by fall 1979, when it became popular among fellow students. \"Wizardry\" drew influences from earlier games from the PLATO system, most notably the 1977 role-playing game \"Oubliette\". It was initially coded in Applesoft BASIC, but Greenberg and Woodhead rewrote it in UCSD Pascal after BASIC proved too slow to be playable. They had to wait for a run-time system, not available until early 1981, before publishing it. The game took two and a half man-years to complete, but the delay benefited \"Wizardry\" by permitting almost one year of playtesting and game balancing before release, distinguishing it from others such as \"Ultima I\". Frederick Sirotek, Norman's businessman father and the company's financier, insisted that the packaging and documentation be professional, also distinguishing the game from others sold in Ziploc bags.\n\nThe Commodore 64/128 versions of \"Wizardry\" 1-3 share a common code base with the Apple originals, as they all use the same run-time 6502 Pascal interpreter which provides support for overlays and low-level functions to interface with the hardware. USCD Pascal was also used for the IBM versions, but with an x86 version of the interpreter.\n\nLengthy load time and extensive disk access was a problem with \"Wizardry\"; however, the Commodore versions, which particularly suffer from this, provided a variety of workarounds. In C128 mode, the VDC memory is used to store overlays and REUs are supported in both C64 and C128 mode. Wizardry 2-5 also detect if 16k or 64k of VDC memory is present and can use the 1571 drive's burst mode for faster load time.\n\n\"Werdna\" and \"Trebor\" are Greenberg and Woodhead's first names spelled backwards. Their names also appear as initials (i.e., ACG and RJW) on the map of the eighth and ninth floors.\n\nSir-Tech published \"Wizardry\", Revision 2 in 1982, which implemented a number of new features. John M. Morrison for \"The Space Gamer\" No. 50 commented that \"By this time, your old disk should be wearing out. I definitely recommend sending the $5 in to transfer backup characters, as you'll get Revision 2 to boot.\"\n\n\"Wizardry\" shipped in September 1981 and almost immediately became a hit, the most popular Apple II game of the year. By 30 June 1982 it had sold 24,000 copies, making it one of the best-selling computer RPGs in North America up until that time. In comparison, \"Temple of Apshai\" (1979) had sold 30,000 copies and \"\" (1981) sold 20,000 copies at the time. \"Electronic Games\" described \"Wizardry\" in 1983 as \"without a doubt, the most popular fantasy adventure game for the Apple II at the present time.\" \"Wizardry\" eventually sold 200,000 copies, over the course of three years, outselling the original \"Ultima\" during that time. Based on sales and market-share data, \"Video\" magazine listed \"Wizardry\" tenth on its list of best selling video games in February 1985, and ninth on the best seller list in March 1985, with \"II Computing\" listing \"Wizardry\" third on its list of top Apple II games as of October–November 1985 (behind \"Zork\" and \"Sargon III\", and ahead of \"Zaxxon\" and \"Ultima III\").\n\nWithin months of \"Wizardry\"s release at least two commercial game trainers for it appeared, despite Sir-Tech denouncing their use. The game also had perhaps the first strategy guide, \"The Wizisystem\", which promised that \"the average player\" could succeed in the game with \"a successful, easy-to-follow format\". A child psychiatrist reported success in using the game as therapy. The game eventually led to a series of eight games spanning twenty years, and helped set genre standards with its intuitive layout and interface.\n\nForrest Johnson reviewed \"Wizardry\" in \"The Space Gamer\" No. 46. He commented that \"\"Wizardry\" represents a leap in computer game design. It is certainly the best D&D-style computer game on the market\". The game was reviewed in 1982 in \"The Dragon\" #65 by Bruce Humphrey. Humphrey stated that \"There is so much good about this game, it's difficult to decide where to begin\", and concluded by describing it as \"not easily beaten or solved, I recommend it to anyone tired of mediocre programs and ho-hum dungeon encounters.\" \"Computer Gaming World\" that year praised it as \"one of the all-time classic computer games\", complex yet playable. With no major faults, the only minor one described in the review is the ease with which parties can initially be killed.\n\nThe Macintosh version of the game, known by fans as \"MacWizardry\", was reviewed in 1986 in \"Dragon\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers called MacWizardry \"a delightful reintroduction of a marvelous classic.\" In a subsequent column, the reviewers gave the Mac version of the game 4 out of 5 stars. Jerry Pournelle named it one of two games of the month for March 1986, writing \"I don't know what the fascination of Wizardry I is; if I describe it in objective terms, it seems boring—which it certainly is not, as witness the time it has eaten this month\".\n\nThe \"Wizardry\" series was ported to various Japanese computers such as the NEC PC-8801 and became popular there. Along with \"Ultima\", it inspired JRPG series like \"Dragon Quest\" and \"Final Fantasy\".\n\nIn 1984 \"Softline\" readers named the game the most popular Apple program of all time. The game was the top-rated adventure for five years in \"Computer Gaming World\"s reader poll, until \"Ultima IV\" replaced it in 1986, and with a score of 7.69 out of 10, in 1988 \"Wizardry\" was among the first members of the magazine's Hall of Fame, honoring those games rated highly over time by readers, as the magazine's 1982 review predicted. In 1990 the game received the ninth-highest number of votes in a survey of \"Computer Gaming World\" readers' \"All-Time Favorites\", and in 1991 and 1993 the magazine's Scorpia wrote that \"while mainly hack-and-slash, it's still a grand expedition, even today\". In 1996, the magazine named \"Wizardry\" the 16th best game ever. The editors wrote, \"The seminal dungeon romp, this RPG sent AD&D fans scrambling to buy Apple IIs.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2308525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308525", "title": "Death of James Ashley", "text": "Death of James Ashley\n\nJames Ashley was a British man shot dead by police at his flat in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, on 15 January 1998, while unarmed and naked. Armed officers had been sent to raid the flat based on reports that Ashley kept a firearm and a quantity of cocaine there, and to arrest Ashley and another man in connection with a stabbing. No firearm or significant quantity of drugs was found, the other man was not present, and it later emerged that Ashley was not implicated in the stabbing. Ashley, likely woken by the noise of the raid, was out of bed when an officer entered his bedroom. On seeing the officer, Ashley raised one arm and the officer reacted by firing a single shot. Later that morning Sussex Police's chief constable, Paul Whitehouse held a press conference in which he praised the conduct of the operation. \n\nTwo inquiries were held by outside forces under the auspices of the Police Complaints Authority (PCA), both of which strongly criticised the raid. The first found that the use of armed officers breached national guidelines, that the raid team had been inadequately trained, and that the officers in charge of it had received no training for their roles and had misrepresented intelligence in order to gain authorisation for the operation. The second inquiry accused Whitehouse, Deputy Chief Constable Mark Jordan, and Sussex's two assistant chief constables of colluding to obstruct the first. It suggested that Whitehouse knowingly gave false statements in his press conference, and recommended criminal charges against three of the four. The officer who shot Ashley was charged with murder in 2001 but acquitted on the grounds of self-defence. The officers who led the operation were charged with misconduct in public office and were also acquitted. No criminal charges were brought against the chief officers, but Jordan and Whitehouse both faced disciplinary proceedings. Jordan was suspended and allowed to retire in 2001. Whitehouse resigned in the same year under pressure from the Home Secretary, David Blunkett. His successor publicly apologised to Ashley's family in 2003.\n\nAshley's father and son sued the police for negligence and battery, in Ashley v Chief Constable of Sussex Police. The police offered to settle all damages under the action for negligence and the other claims were struck out at the High Court, which the family appealed. The case reached the House of Lords (then the United Kingdom's highest court), where the appeal was successful. The lords confirmed that the threshold for a plea of self-defence in a civil case was higher than in a criminal one and that it was for the litigants, not the judge, to decide which causes of action to pursue, even where no further damages were available. \n\nAshley's death has been compared to other mistaken police shootings, and was one of the cases considered in a 2003 report by the PCA which recommended stronger control of armed operations and equipping armed officers with non-lethal alternatives such as Tasers.\n\nJames \"Jimmy\" Ashley was a 39-year-old man from Liverpool living in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, on the south coast of England. He was suspected by Sussex Police of being involved in the distribution of heroin, and the police had heard unsubstantiated rumours that he owned a gun. Ashley and a group of friends occupied three of the six flats in a converted house in Western Road. The police placed the building under surveillance in October 1997, though the operation was wound up without producing any substantive evidence.\n\nOn 7 January 1998, Ashley was present when a friend he had been drinking with, Thomas \"Tosh\" McCrudden, stabbed and seriously wounded another man in an argument outside a pub in Hastings town centre, though Ashley's only involvement was to pull McCrudden away from the victim. In the following week, armed officers were deployed to pursue several leads but failed to apprehend McCrudden. Officers believed McCrudden was staying in the Western Road house and formulated a plan to raid it. Detectives obtained a search warrant based on a tip-off from an officer in the regional crime squad that a large quantity of cocaine had been delivered to the house, and the plan to use armed officers was authorised by the deputy chief constable, Mark Jordan, based on the rumour that Ashley had a firearm. The officers conducting the raid were briefed that McCrudden was dangerous and known to be in the flats and about the potential firearm. They were also told that Ashley was wanted for shooting a man in Eastbourne and had a previous conviction for attempted murder. At the time, it was the largest firearms operation in the force's history, using 25 armed officers.\n\nOn 15 January, at approximately 04:30, officers from Sussex Police executed a search warrant on the Western Road house. The operation had three stated objectives—the apprehension of McCrudden, the retrieval of the cocaine, and the seizure of the firearm. It used a technique known as \"Bermuda\", which was originally designed for hostage-rescue operations but had become standard in Sussex Police for rapid entry operations to secure evidence. The technique was known to be high-risk as it involved lone officers rapidly entering an assigned room before calling in backup if a threat was found, and had previously been criticised in the media, while other police forces had discontinued its use. Only four of the six occupants of the flats were the target of the raid, but the police did not have details of which occupants lived in which of the flats. The police also lacked plans for the building, hampering the raid as they encountered a locked internal door. Once opened, the door blocked the entrance to Ashley's flat, further delaying the officers.\n\nAshley had been naked in bed when his girlfriend woke him to investigate a noise, likely caused by police forcing doors in the building. As he moved towards the door of his darkened bedroom, he suddenly encountered one of the officers. Ashley raised his arm, to which the officer reacted by firing a single shot at a range of about . Ashley was hit in the armpit and the bullet travelled to his heart, killing him almost immediately. At the conclusion of the raid, no firearms or significant quantity of drugs was found. Three men in two other flats were arrested but McCrudden was not among them and none were wanted by the police; all three were later released without charge. On the day of the raid, Sussex Police's chief constable, Paul Whitehouse, held a press conference at which he announced that Ashley had been wanted for attempted murder. He praised the conduct of the operation, and claimed that the deployment of armed officers had been justified and necessary.\n\nAn inquiry was launched by neighbouring Kent Police under the supervision of the Police Complaints Authority (PCA), and led by Barbara Wilding, an assistant chief constable. Two police constables (including PC Christopher Sherwood, the officer who shot Ashley) were suspended, along with three more senior officers—a superintendent and two inspectors. Two superintendents from other police forces, experts on police firearms policy, gave evidence to the Kent Police inquiry that the operation did not follow national guidelines for police use of firearms, and that the use of armed officers was not necessary to apprehend McCrudden as there was no evidence that he had access to firearms; further, if a firearm was believed to be in the flat, the preferable tactic would have been to arrest the suspects on the street rather than send police officers into the building. The investigation further found that the use of armed officers in earlier attempts to arrest McCrudden again breached national guidelines in that senior officers improperly granted authority for the use of firearms, and that on several occasions armed officers deployed without authorisation at all. \n\nThe inquiry revealed that neither the police officer in charge of the manhunt for McCrudden (the incident commander) nor the intelligence commander on the operation were adequately trained for their roles and that they had been warned against the use of the \"Bermuda\" tactic by national experts because it presented too high a risk for the stated objectives, and that the police had failed to prepare for the operation by obtaining plans for the building and details of other occupants. It also emerged that the officers deployed on the raid had never trained as a group in the use of the tactic, and that Sherwood had never been trained in it individually. The Kent inquiry concluded that the basis for the raid was \"not merely exaggerated, it was determinably false\" and that the officers involved in its planning had \"concocted\" the evidence and planned to misrepresent it in order to justify the operation.\n\nThe PCA commissioned a second inquiry, convened in August 1998 and chaired by Sir John Hoddinott, chief constable of Hampshire Constabulary, to investigate the conduct of Sussex's chief officers, after Wilding's report accused them of obstructing her investigation. Hoddinott interviewed Whitehouse, Jordan, and Sussex's two assistant chief constables, Nigel Yeo and Maria Wallis, over allegations that they had misled the original inquiry by claiming that they could not recall key details and that they had misrepresented the intelligence that led to the raid. The Hoddinott inquiry suggested that the incident commander and intelligence commander both knew that neither McCrudden nor the cocaine were in the building, or that they at least exaggerated the strength of the intelligence, in order to bolster their case for authorisation to the deputy chief constable. In particular, the tip off from the regional crime squad was in fact in relation to a potential drugs shipment to an unrelated address, the belief that McCrudden was inside was exaggerated from a report of an unidentified man entering the building, and the report of a firearm was based on nothing more than rumour. \n\nHoddinott sharply criticised Whitehouse and the press conference he held on the day of the raid, in which, according to the report, Whitehouse \"wilfully failed to tell the truth as he knew it; he did so without reasonable excuse or justification and what he published and said was misleading and therefore likely to injure the public interest\". His report suggested there was \"evidence of collusion between some or all of the chief officers\" of Sussex Police to conceal what they already knew at the time of the press conference (that Ashley was unarmed, that no significant quantity of drugs had been found, and that McCrudden was not present), and that \"an arguable case of attempting to pervert the course of justice might be made out\", though he concluded that a charge of misconduct in public office was more credible. Hoddinott also accused Jordan of malfeasance, discreditable conduct, and supporting Whitehouse's false statements, and Yeo, one of the assistant chief constables, of malfeasance.\n\nSherwood was charged with murder and tried at the Old Bailey in London in 2001, but was acquitted after the trial judge, Mrs Justice Anne Rafferty, directed the jury to find him not guilty. Sherwood claimed self-defence, telling the court that he feared for his life, believing—based on the briefing for the operation—that Ashley's outstretched arm was holding a firearm and was about to shoot. In directing the jury, the judge stated that no evidence had been presented that Sherwood fired other than in self-defence, and in her summing up suggested that \"those who should be held accountable were not present\" in her court. The superintendent and two inspectors suspended after the first inquiry were then prosecuted for misconduct in public office in relation to their planning and execution of the raid. The prosecution alleged that the three had deliberately failed to give an accurate representation of the intelligence but all three were found not guilty at Wolverhampton Crown Court when the Crown Prosecution Service declined to offer any evidence. Nigel Sweeney, prosecuting, told the court that the depth of \"corporate failing\" within Sussex Police made it impossible to place criminal liability with individual officers. Following the verdict Ashley's family announced their intention to sue Sussex Police for negligence. \nHoddinott's report was forwarded to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for consideration of charges against the chief officers of Sussex Police for misconduct in public office, but the CPS dropped the case on the grounds of insufficient evidence. Whitehouse was suspended for three weeks while the Sussex police authority considered Hoddinott's report but was reinstated with written advice, in which the authority told him it was \"not satisfied that you have not committed a disciplinary offence\", and instructed him that \"your role as a strong and supportive commander of your force should never be confused with your duty never to mislead or misinform\". He resigned in 2001 after the Home Secretary, David Blunkett, wrote to the police authority, instructing them to consider dismissing Whitehouse. Jordan was also suspended after the report and faced internal disciplinary proceedings following the CPS's decision not to pursue criminal charges, but was allowed to retire on medical grounds in 2001. The three middle-ranking officers acquitted of misconduct in public office remained suspended pending internal disciplinary proceedings, which were dropped in 2003. The officers, along with two others involved in Ashley's death, sued the force the following year, claiming it had been negligent in failing to train them properly and that they had suffered psychiatric injury as a result of the shooting and subsequent criminal and disciplinary proceedings. Their case was thrown out at the High Court and an appeal in 2006 was dismissed on the grounds that the damages suffered were too remote from the alleged negligence to be reasonably foreseeable.\n\nThe local coroner opened an inquest in the immediate aftermath of Ashley's death but it was adjourned pending the outcome of the police investigations and criminal proceedings. In 2001, the coroner informed the interested parties that the inquest would not be resumed. As a result, the family began campaigning for a public inquiry into the circumstances of Ashley's death and the subsequent investigations. The government considered the request but no such inquiry was held.\n\nWhitehouse's successor as chief constable, Ken Jones, almost immediately introduced changes to the force's policies on conducting armed operations. He also issued an apology on behalf of the force in 2003, travelling to Liverpool to make the apology to Ashley's mother in person. He said \"James should not have died but, and this will be of small comfort to his loved ones and friends, his death has resulted in safer firearms procedures for us all\". Ashley's family welcomed the apology but, with the backing of their local MP, Louise Ellman, continued to campaign for a public inquiry.\n\nAshley's son and father sued Sussex Police for the torts of negligence (in respect of the planning of the operation and the shooting itself), battery, false imprisonment, and misfeasance in public office. The case was first heard by Mrs Justice Linda Dobbs in the High Court in 2004 as \"Ashley v Chief Constable of Sussex Police\". The police admitted false imprisonment and to negligence in relation to the planning of the raid but denied liability for all other counts (including negligence regarding the shooting itself). They offered to pay the full amount of damages sought by the Ashleys under those causes of action. Mrs Justice Dobbs ruled, on summary judgment, that the police's offer meant that continuing with the other claims would be an abuse of process, and that the action for battery had no realistic prospect of success as the burden of proof was on the claimants, who could not negate Sherwood's self-defence claim from the criminal trial.\n\nThe Ashleys appealed the striking out of their claim for battery to the Court of Appeal, where the case was heard in 2006. The Court of Appeal held that the judge had erred in her decision that the battery claim had no realistic prospect of success and in her decision that the burden of proof rested with the claimant to disprove a defence of self-defence in a civil case. The court allowed the family's appeal, holding that—in a civil action for battery—the burden was on the respondent (the police) to prove their claim of self-defence, and that the claim had to be based on both an \"honest\" and a \"reasonable\" belief of being in imminent danger, a higher standard than in criminal law. The court (by a majority) also held that continuing the claim for battery would not be an abuse of process, even though the police had offered to pay all the compensation sought by the family under the claims for negligence and false imprisonment (meaning that they would receive no further damages if their claim for battery succeeded).\n\nThe police appealed the decision to the House of Lords, then the United Kingdom's court of last resort. The Law Lords considered two main issues, both in relation to the battery claim. The first was the standard for a self-defence claim in a civil case and whether, in a case of a mistaken belief that the defendant was under attack, that belief must be both honest \"and\" reasonable, and the second was whether it would be an abuse of process to allow the battery claim to proceed given the police's offer to pay all the damages sought. On the first, the lords unanimously upheld the Court of Appeal's finding that both criteria must be met for a defence of self-defence to succeed in a tort action. Lord Scott noted that \"it is fundamental to criminal law [...] that, as a general rule, no-one should be for a crime he or she did not intend to commit or be punished for the consequences of an honest mistake\" but that \"the function of the civil law is [...] to identify and protect the rights that every person is entitled to assert against, and require to be respected by, others\" and that the law \"must strike a balance between these conflicting rights\". He concluded that \"it is one thing to say that if A's mistaken belief was honestly held he should not be punished by the criminal law. It would be quite another to say that A's unreasonably held mistaken belief would be sufficient to justify the law in setting aside B's right not to be subjected to physical violence\". \n\nThe lords were split on the second point, the minority (Lord Bingham and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry) believing that, although tort law could be vindicatory in nature, no further vindication would be achieved by allowing the claim for battery given that no further damages were available, and that allowing the claim would amount to an attack on the not guilty verdict in Sherwood's criminal trial. Lord Carswell, quoting Lord Justice Auld from the Court of Appeal, opined that \"the civil courts exist to award compensation, not conduct public inquiries\". Nonetheless, the majority (three to two) held that the battery claim was not an abuse of process and that it was for the litigants, not the judiciary, to decide which actions to pursue, noting that the success of the claim would not expose Sherwood to double jeopardy, and noting again the different purposes of tort and criminal law.\n\nAlthough the case merely confirmed existing law, rather than changing it or creating new law, it was still deemed significant for its confirmation that the standard for a claim of self-defence was higher in a civil case than a criminal one, and for Lord Scott's analysis of the differing purposes of criminal and civil law and the confirmation that a \"not guilty\" verdict in a criminal court did not preclude civil liability.\n\nAccording to Nick Davies, in an investigation for \"The Guardian\" newspaper in 2001, Ashley's death was one of 41 incidents in the preceding decade in which police in England and Wales shot a person who turned out not to have a firearm. Of those shootings, at least 15 proved fatal. In 28 of the 41 cases, the person shot had a replica firearm or some other kind of weapon, and another six were accidental discharges, leaving seven (including Ashley) which Davies described as \"disturbing\". Davies concluded that \"this might look like a [...] a licence for police officers to kill. In reality, it indicates something very different but equally disturbing[...]: police use of firearms is inherently dangerous. The more police are armed, the more they will shoot the wrong people. And the law which surrounds this is inadequate and incapable of fixing the blame when things go wrong\". Davies described Ashley's shooting as \"merely the final shot in a volley of error unleashed by just about every rank in Sussex police\".\n\nAshley's death has been compared by the media and academics to several other mistaken shootings by police officers in Britain, in particular the 1983 shooting of Stephen Waldorf, the 1985 death of John Shorthouse, the 1999 death of Harry Stanley, and the 2005 death of Jean Charles de Menezes. Waldorf was a film editor shot and seriously injured by police officers in London after he was mistaken for an escaped criminal; he later sued the police and was awarded substantial damages. Shorthouse was a five-year-old boy who was shot dead during an armed police raid on his parents' home in Birmingham. Stanley was shot dead by a police armed response team who mistook a table leg he was carrying for a firearm; after two inquests, a criminal investigation, and an independent inquiry it was eventually decided that the officers involved would not face criminal or disciplinary proceedings. Menezes was a Brazilian electrician who was wrongly identified as a fugitive terrorist involved in a failed suicide bombing the day before and was shot by counter-terrorism officers when he boarded a London Underground train.\n\nAmong Jones's first actions as the new chief constable was to strengthen Sussex Police's procedures for the deployment of armed officers. In January 2003, a PCA report considered 24 police shootings from 1998 to 2001, including Ashley's. Among its recommendations were that armed police officers also be equipped with non-lethal options, such as tasers, to reduce the chances of further shootings, a recommendation that was endorsed by Ashley's mother. The report also recommended stronger command and control of firearms operations.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2308530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308530", "title": "Livio Dante Porta", "text": "Livio Dante Porta\n\nLivio Dante Porta (21 March 1922 – 10 June 2003) was an Argentine steam locomotive engineer. He is particularly remembered for his innovative modifications to existing locomotive systems in order to obtain better performance and energy efficiency, and reduced pollution. He developed the Kylpor and Lempor exhaust systems. The Lemprex was under development at the time of his death.\n\nPorta was born in Paraná, Entre Ríos, and studied civil engineering, concluding his studies in 1946, at a time when steam was already giving way to diesel and electric locomotives in Europe and North America.\n\nNaturally Porta's first projects were in Argentina. Taking the work of Andre Chapelon in France as his starting point he set out to show that the steam locomotive was far from reaching its maximum potential. His first locomotive project in 1948 took the remains of a 4-6-2 converting it into a 4-cylinder compound 4-8-0 named 'Presidente Peron'/'Argentina'. This machine, Porta's first project, still holds a number of locomotive efficiency records.\n\nPorta moved to Patagonia in 1957 as general manager of the Red de Ferrocarril Industrial de Rio Turbio coal railway (Ramal Ferro Industrial Río Turbio) in Santa Cruz; his work allowed the steam locomotive fleet to remain in service for another 40 years. In 1960 he returned to Buenos Aires to become head of thermodynamics at the National Institute of Industrial Technology (INTI). His writings on steam technology, mostly unpublished, are voluminous.\n\nIn early 1983 Porta and his family moved to the United States to work on steam locomotive development for the American Coal Enterprises project. This was the only time in his life he lived outside of Argentina for any great length of time. After the collapse of this project he returned to Argentina in 1986 with further work being undertaken in that country as well as Brazil and Paraguay. In 1992 Porta was contracted by the Cuban government to implement an extensive project on rational use of energy, which included modern steam rail traction as well as general industrial steam modernisation of power stations and sugar mill plants. His final steam project was the development of a steam bus in the capital of Buenos Aires along with Gustavo Durán; Porta had already designed a modern steam car whilst at INTI during 1970.\n\nPorta continued advancing steam technology right up to the time of his death: from the mid-1990s he worked for the Cuban Sugar Ministry (Minaz) on locomotives using new fuels such as bagasse; he also considerably influenced many later steam projects worldwide, notably those of David Wardale and the 5AT Project, Phil Girdlestone, Roger Waller, Shaun McMahon, and Nigel Day.\n\nIn 2001 he supported Shaun McMahon's heavy rebuilding and modification of a 500 mm-gauge Garratt for the Southern Fuegian Railway that had been produced in Argentina in 1994. McMahon included larger cross section for tubing, insulation of the boiler and improved front end as well as combustion system in line with Porta's teachings over the years; the economy of this modern steam engine was improved vastly, more than doubling train length. As a tribute to Porta's lifetime work and in celebration of his upcoming 80th birthday, McMahon named the locomotive \"Ing. L.D. PORTA\" when it was presented to the public on 11 December 2001. A second Garratt with similar technical specifications was built by Phil Girdlestone in South Africa and delivered to the FCAF in 2006. A third is now under construction again with similar technical features, in Ushuaia.\n\nHe was a devoted family man and he and his wife, Ana Marie, had four children. One of his three sons died of cancer at an early age. On 7 July 1976, during Argentina's Dirty War, his daughter was taken at gunpoint from her home and never seen again.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2308535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308535", "title": "The Fairyland Story", "text": "The Fairyland Story\n\nGameplay has often been compared to other Taito platform games, such as \"Bubble Bobble\", \"The NewZealand Story\" and \"Liquid Kids\". A Japanese MSX version developed and published by Hot-B was released in 1987, while a Sharp X68000 port was developed and published in 1991 by SPS. \"The Fairyland Story\" would be included in the arcade game collections \"Taito Legends 2\", \"Taito Memories Jokan,\" and \"Taito Legends Power-Up\". A 2003 port for Japanese mobile phones was made available through the I-mode and EZweb network services.\n\n\"The Fairyland Story\" is a platform arcade game. The player controls the witch Ptolemy through a series of single-screen stages, with the objective being to defeat all of the enemies on each screen. Ptolemy's main weapon is her projectile magic, which will temporarily transform the enemies into large cakes. While in a \"caked\" form, the enemies can be destroyed either by further magic attacks or by being dropped off a platform, possibly squashing other enemies below. Squashing more than one enemy results in an award of more points and, sometimes, in extra bonuses. 2000 points are awarded for squashing an enemy below a cake, with each additional enemy doubling the number of points awarded. If two or more enemies are killed at once in one spot, a coin will appear in that spot, which may be collected for additional points, and if more are collected, will multiply in points, so as long the player doesn't lose a life.\n\nPtolemy's enemies are based upon typical fantasy beings - these include Orcs, pig-like soldiers, Salamanders, dragon-like creatures that can breathe fire, Wizards, mages that can make Ptolemy shrink and disappear, Clerics, bishops who can multiply themselves, Golems, and Wraiths, hooded creatures can phase through Ptolemy's magic. If Ptolemy takes too long to clear a level of a last remaining enemy, eventually that enemy will disappear without an award of points. If, however, Ptolemy takes too long to clear more than one enemy from the level, a flying devil, named Horned, appears to kill Ptolemy. The devil is invulnerable to Ptolemy's magic, and the only way to survive is for Ptolemy to kill all remaining enemies. This game element is very similar to the \"Beluga\" or \"Skel Monsta\" fish that limit the time allowed for each level in the later Taito game \"Bubble Bobble\".\n\nPtolemy's deaths are animated in different ways, depending on the enemy who kills her. She can sometimes collect some utility bonuses which increase her power and range of her magic for a short while or offensive bonuses that, most usually, result in the cake-ification and destruction of all on-screen enemies. At various intervals between levels, an intermission screen appears during the game showing Ptolemy riding on the back of a large, wingless blue dragon named Rodemy. A message appears on each of these intermission screens, either congratulating the player or warning of some hazard in the next level. Many of these messages contain incorrect English idioms or grammar typical of Engrish.\n\n\"The Fairyland Story\" was released by Taito in Japan in July 1985 and in North America later that year. It was designed by Hiroshi \"ONIJIST\" Tsujino, best known for designing \"The Ninja Warriors\", with music composed by Tadashi Kimijima. While working at Taito's Yokohama Institute, Tsujino drafted an idea for a game where the player had to defeat enemies by crushing them under large cakes, which he claims to be partly inspired by his addiction to Namco's \"Dig Dug\". Early versions of the game were said to have been \"monotonous\" and left Tsujino largely unhappy with the outcome — being inspired by Broderbund's \"Lode Runner\" for the Apple II, he gave the game a larger emphasis on strategy and memorization, featuring reworked stage designs. The game's final boss took a week to complete. Executives at Taito were against the idea of the game having an ending and demanded that the team remove it, however Tsujino ignored their request.\n\nAn MSX port, developed and published by Hot-B, was released on September 3, 1987. This port featured degraded graphics and sound from the arcade version, typical for most arcade ports on the MSX, but had new stages, to perhaps make up for the degradation in graphics and sound. Some of these new stages are based on other Taito properties, like level 37 resembling Mr. Chack'n from \"Chack'n Pop\". The port also featured two new enemies, the Iron Golem, which is the same as the Golem enemy but immune to Ptolemy's magic, and Fleck, an enemy that can use the same magic as Ptolemy. Hot-B was also developing a port for the Famicom, but the port was later cancelled for unknown reasons. Later, in 1991, a Sharp X68000 port was developed and published by SPS, and was released on September 27, 1991. Unlike the MSX port, however, this was a more straightforward port of the arcade version, like most arcade ports on the Sharp X68000. It added several features not found in the original arcade version, like level progress and high score saving, and the choice between two soundtracks, the choices being an emulation of the original soundtrack, or a remixed soundtrack. In 2003, a port was made available for Japanese mobile phones via the I-mode and EZweb network services. Not much information is known about this port besides some screenshots, and some of the music from this port appearing in a soundtrack album for mobile games made by Taito. Emulated versions of the original arcade version would later be included on the arcade collections \"Taito Legends 2\", \"Taito Memories Jokan,\" and \"Taito Legends Power-Up.\"\n\nReviewing \"Taito Legends 2\", Kristan Reed of Eurogamer wrote \"The Fairyland Story\" \"is a lot of fun - although lacks the two-player co-op fun, sadly. (...) Hugely addictive, though.\"\n\nPtolemy appears as a player character in \"Space Invaders DX\" (1994), \"Pop'n Pop\" (1998), \"Daifugo Party\" (2010), and \"Arkanoid vs. Space Invaders\" (2017). She has also made cameo appearances in several other games, including \"The New Zealand Story\" (1988), \"Bubble Symphony\" (1994), \"Bubble Memories\" (1996), and \"Arkanoid DS\" (2007). (1987) has a secret island based on \"The Fairyland Story\", named Magical Island, with the enemies and music from it being used in the secret island. Ptolemy herself does not appear in most versions of \"Rainbow Islands\" that feature the secret island\",\" however, she does make a cameo appearance in the Game Boy Color port of \"Rainbow Islands\" in the cutscenes proceeding and after Magical Island. The Worm enemy makes appearances in both \"Don Doko Don\" (1989) and \"Don Doko Don 2\" (1991). Many of the \"Bubble Bobble\" and \"The New Zealand Story\" gameplay elements, and even some graphics and bonuses, first appeared in \"The Fairyland Story\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2308563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308563", "title": "Dollar sign", "text": "Dollar sign\n\nThe dollar sign or peso sign ($ or ) is a symbol used to indicate the units of various currencies around the world, including the peso and the US dollar. The symbol can interchangeably have one or two vertical strokes. In common usage, the sign appears to the left of the amount specified, e.g. \"$1\", read as \"one dollar\".\n\nThere are several hypotheses about the origin of the dollar sign.\n\nThe sign is first attested in Spanish American, American, Canadian, Mexican, and other British business correspondence in the 1770s, referring to the Spanish American peso, also known as \"Spanish dollar\" or \"piece of eight\" in North America, which provided the model for the currency that the United States adopted in 1792 and the larger coins of the new Spanish American republics such as the Mexican peso, Peruvian eight-real, and Bolivian eight-sol coins.\n\nThis explanation holds that the sign evolved out of the Spanish and Spanish American scribal abbreviation \"pˢ\" for pesos. A study of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century manuscripts shows that the \"s\" gradually came to be written over the \"p\", developing into a close equivalent to the \"$\" mark. A variation, though less plausible, of this hypothesis derives the sign from a combination of the Greek character \"psi\" (ψ) and \"S\".\n\nThere are a number of other hypotheses about the origin of the symbol, some with a measure of academic acceptance, others the symbolic equivalent of false etymologies.\n\nAmong the various hypotheses, the simplest one is that the barred S is actually a typo modified 8, from its obvious link with the pieces of eight, the popular name of the Spanish dollar. The added (single or double) bar should be the same commonly used to distinguish a letter dedicated to a currency value, like £.\n\nDeniers minted by Manfred of Hohenstaufen in the Kingdom of Sicily between 1258 and 1266 had what can be construed as an early dollar symbol. These coins were widely circulated outside Europe due to the Crusades, including the Crusade that targeted Tunis.\n\nAnother hypothesis holds that the sign derives from the symbolic representation of the Pillars of Hercules. This representation can have either a banner separately around each pillar, or, as in the Spanish coat of arms, a banner curling between them.\n\nIn 1492, Ferdinand II of Aragon adopted the symbol of the Pillars of Hercules and added the Latin warning \"Non plus ultra\" meaning \"nothing further beyond\", indicating \"this is the end of the (known) world\". But when Christopher Columbus came to America, the legend was changed to \"Plus ultra\", meaning \"further beyond\". The Pillars of Hercules wrapped in a banner thus became a symbol of the New World. The link between this symbol and the dollar sign is more clearly seen in Spanish coins of the period, which show two pillars, each with a separate banner, rather than one banner spanning both pillars. In this example the right-hand pillar resembles the dollar sign, and additionally directly relates to the use of money.\n\nThe symbol was adopted by Charles V and was part of his coat of arms representing Spain's American possessions. The symbol was later stamped on coins minted in gold and silver. The coin, also known as Spanish dollar, was the first global currency used in the world since the Spanish Empire was the first global empire. These coins, depicting the pillars over two hemispheres and a small \"S\"-shaped ribbon around each, were spread throughout America, Europe, and Asia. According to this, traders wrote signs that, instead of saying \"Spanish dollar\" (piece of eight, \"real de a ocho\" in Spanish or \"peso duro\"), had this symbol made by hand, and this in turn evolved into a simple S with two vertical bars. When the United States gained their independence from Great Britain, they created the US dollar, but in its early decades they continued to use the Spanish dollar, which was more trusted in all markets, until the Coinage Act of 1857, passed on February 21, 1857, officially demonetized foreign currency.\n\nThe United States, even after independence, was still using the pound sterling as currency. This is attested in state legislation of the early 1780s, referring to pounds and pence, which predated the U.S. Constitution and federal legislation.\n\nGiven the origin of this theory – related to Spanish (and Portuguese) colonisation of the Americas – it is likely that the or peso signs share the same origin, and that the double stroke usage is merely a stylistic variant, rather than a distinct character.\n\nSeveral alternative hypotheses relate specifically to the dollar sign drawn with two vertical lines.\n\nA dollar sign with two vertical lines could have started off as a monogram of 'USA', used on money bags issued by the United States Mint. The letters U and S superimposed resemble the historical double-stroke dollar sign : the bottom of the 'U' disappears into the bottom curve of the 'S', leaving two vertical lines. It is postulated in the papers of Dr. James Alton James, a professor of history at Northwestern University from 1897 to 1935, that the symbol with two strokes was an adapted design of the patriot Robert Morris in 1778. Robert Morris was such a zealous patriot – known as the \"Financier of the Revolution in the West\" – that James came to believe that this hypothesis is viable. A similar idea claims that the letters U and S would stand for unit of silver, referencing pieces of eight again, but that is unlikely since one would expect it to be in Spanish instead.\n\nThe $1 United States Note issued by the United States in 1869 included a symbol consisting of a partially overlapping U and S, with one of the bars of the U intersecting the S.\n\nAnother hypothesis is that it derives from the symbol used on a German Thaler. According to Ovason (2004), on one type of thaler one side showed a crucifix while the other showed a serpent hanging from a cross, the letters NU near the serpent's head, and on the other side of the cross the number 21. This refers to the Bible, Numbers, Chapter 21 (see Nehushtan).\n\nA similar symbol, constructed by superposition of \"S\" and \"I\" or \"J\", was used to denote German Joachimsthaler (\"S\" and \"J\" standing for St. Joachim who gave his name to the place where the first thalers were minted). It was known in the English-speaking world by the 17th century, appearing in 1686 edition of \"An Introduction to Merchants' Accounts\" by John Collins.\n\nRobert Morris was the first to use this symbol in official documents and in official communications with Oliver Pollock. The U.S. dollar was directly based on the Spanish Milled Dollar when, in the Coinage Act of 1792, the first Mint Act, its value was fixed (per the U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8, clause 1 power of the United States Congress \"To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures\") as being \"of the value of a Spanish milled dollar as the same is now current, and to contain three hundred and seventy-one grains and four sixteenth parts of a grain of pure, or four hundred and sixteen grains of standard silver\".\n\nAccording to a plaque in St Andrews, Scotland, the dollar sign was first cast into type at a foundry in Philadelphia, United States, in 1797 by the Scottish immigrants John Baine, Archibald Binney, and James Ronaldson.\n\nThe dollar sign did not appear on U.S. coinage until February 2007, when it was used on the reverse of a $1 coin authorized by the Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005.\n\nThe dollar sign appears as early as 1847 on the $100 Mexican War notes and the reverse of the 1868 $1000 United States note. The dollar sign also appears on the reverse of the 1934 $100,000 note.\n\nIn Japanese and Korean, the Han character 弗 has been repurposed to represent the dollar sign due to its visual similarity.\n\nBecause of its use in early American computer applications such as business accounting, the dollar sign is almost universally present in computer character sets, and thus has been appropriated for many purposes unrelated to money in programming languages and command languages. \n\nThe dollar sign \"$\" has Unicode code point U+0024 (inherited from Latin-1).\n\n\nThere are no separate characters for one- and two-line variants. This is typeface-dependent.\n\nThere are also three other code points that originate from other East Asian standards: the Taiwanese small form variant, the CJK fullwidth form, and the Japanese emoji. The glyphs for these code points are typically larger or smaller than the primary code point, but the difference is mostly aesthetic or typographic, and the meanings of the symbols are the same.\n\nHowever, for usage as the special character in various computing applications (see following sections), U+0024 is typically the only code that is recognized.\n\n\n> touch my_first_file\n> echo \"This is my file.\" > !$\n\n\nIn addition to those countries of the world that use dollars or pesos, a number of other countries use the $ symbol to denote their currencies, including:\n\nAn exception is the Philippine peso, whose sign is written as ₱.\n\nThe dollar sign is also still sometimes used to represent the Malaysian ringgit (which replaced the local dollar), though its official use to represent the currency has been discontinued since 1993.\n\nSome currencies use the \"cifrão\" (), similar to the dollar sign, but always with two strokes:\n\n\nHowever, in Argentina, the $ sign is always used for pesos, and if they want to indicate dollars, they always write U$S 5 or US$5 (5 US dollars).\n\nIn the United States, Mexico, Australia, Argentina, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Pacific Island nations, and English-speaking Canada, the dollar or peso symbol precedes the number. Five dollars or pesos is written and printed as $5, whereas five cents is written as 5¢. In French-speaking Canada, the dollar symbol usually appears after the number ().\n\nSome virtual world and gaming platforms have used the $ symbol to refer to their own virtual currencies, for example:\n\n\nThe symbol is sometimes used derisively to indicate greed or excess money such as in \"Micro$oft\", \"George Luca$\", \"Lar$ Ulrich\", \"Di$ney\", \"Chel$ea\" and \"GW$\"; or supposed overt Americanisation as in \"$ky\". The dollar sign is also used intentionally to stylize names such as A$AP Rocky, Ke$ha, and Ty Dolla $ign or words such as ¥€$. In 1872, Ambrose Bierce referred to the California Governor as $tealand Landford.\n\nIn Scrabble notation, a dollar sign is placed after a word to indicate that it is valid according to the North American word lists, but not according to the British word lists.\n\nThe dollar sign was used as a letter in Turkmen alphabet from 1993 to 1999.\n\n\n"}

McCarty played for the NBA's New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Phoenix Suns, and the Los Angeles Clippers. He last served as head coach of the Evansville Purple Aces.\n\nBorn in Evansville, Indiana, the 6-foot, 10-inch (2.08 m) McCarty played college basketball at the University of Kentucky where he was a part of the team that won the NCAA championship in 1996. In 1994, McCarty's made three-pointer completed Kentucky's 31-point comeback over LSU—the biggest second-half rally in NCAA history. He was selected by the Knicks with the 19th pick in the 1996 NBA Draft.\n\nMcCarty played for the Knicks until October 1997, when he was traded to the Celtics. McCarty played in all 82 games that season, starting 64 of them. He also established career highs in virtually every category during this season. Over the next few years, he was one of Boston's top options off the bench, often making a key defensive play or three point shot. He became a fan favorite in Boston for his gutsy play, hustle, and penchant for making the big shot. He was also a favorite of Hall of Fame player and current announcer Tommy Heinsohn, who often exclaimed, \"I love Walter!\" after some of McCarty's plays.\n\nIn February 2005, McCarty was traded, along with an undisclosed amount of cash, to the Suns for a second-round pick as a result of the Celtics' youth movement. He signed with the Clippers in the offseason of 2005.\n\nIn June 2007, McCarty accepted an assistant coach job at the University of Louisville under head men's basketball coach Rick Pitino, under whom he played at Kentucky and with the Celtics.\n\nIn June 2010, McCarty was named as an assistant coach for the Indiana Pacers under Jim O'Brien, replacing Lester Conner. Walter also played for O'Brien during his tenure with the Celtics.\n\nIn 2011, McCarty was let go by the Pacers when Frank Vogel took over as head coach.\n\nIn August 2013, McCarty joined the Boston Celtics as an assistant coach for the 2013–14 NBA season.\n\nOn March 22, 2018, McCarty was hired as the head men's basketball coach in University of Evansville. On November 12, 2019, McCarty led Evansville to their first victory over a #1 ranked opponent in a 67-64 victory over Kentucky at Rupp Arena in Lexington. On December 27, 2019, McCarty was placed on administrative leave after UE received \"a troubling report about Coach McCarty’s interactions with a member of the campus community\" which appeared to violate Title IX. UE stated that they have \"received reports of unwelcome conduct by Coach McCarty since his arrival in March 2018\" and that McCarty's success does not \"in any way outweigh the need to uphold the standards that define our university.\" Assistant coach Bennie Seltzer was named as interim coach. \n\nAfter additional reports of inappropriate conduct came to light, Evansville fired McCarty on January 21, 2020. In a statement, school officials said that McCarty had been counseled the previous year for inappropriate behavior, and had taken part in Title IX training. The statement added that while the investigation would continue, \"the facts uncovered thus far\" demanded McCarty's immediate firing. In a letter to the university community obtained by local NBC affiliate WFIE-TV, UE president Christopher Pietruszkiewicz said that the investigation had uncovered \"persistent and troublesome facts\" about McCarty's behavior, and that McCarty had attempted to \"improperly influence witnesses.\" Based on this and other incidents, Pietruszkiewicz and other school officials concluded that it was \"untenable\" for McCarty to remain as head coach. Both the university's statement and the letter from Pietruszkiewicz said, \"There is no place at UE for any behavior by any University employee or student that jeopardizes the safety and security of others.\"\n\nHe appeared in the 1998 film \"He Got Game\" as the character \"Mance\". In 2003, McCarty released the CD \"Moment for Love\", an R&B/soul album to generally positive reviews. He sang the National Anthem prior to All-Star Saturday Night on the eve of the 2006 NBA All-Star Game. McCarty has two daughters, Gabrielle and Sasha.\n\n"}

Paid content is usually copyrighted. \n\nSome internet content has always historically been paid for — until recently there has been little discussion about paying for scientific, technical and medical (STM) content as well as certain trade information.\n\nPrinted newspaper circulation has fallen steadily since the advent of the internet – in 2008 in the USA alone newspapers lost $64.5 billion in market value. As newspapers' online readership has increased, the newspaper industry has been forced to re-evaluate their business models in the light of falling advertising revenues. While online editions of newspapers have been extremely popular, advertising rates online are lower than for print media, and revenues from them have not been sufficient to offset the loss of revenue from print.\n\nIn 2009, Rupert Murdoch proposed a method of micropayments for online newspaper content. From June 2010, certain News International titles were only available as paid content.\n\nThe music industry has had some success in creating new markets of legal downloading where lower costs and accessibility have led to success, and some suggest there are parallels between the major victims of digitalisation – the music industry and the media.\n\nThe MP3 file can often be duplicated, passed on and exchanged – without capacity boundaries or losses suffered by an individual. These features of MP3 files as an example of digital content are one of the main reasons for the huge revenue collapses in the music and media industry since the existence of the Internet. Online games, however, as an example of digital services, is only a right to participate when the purchased input is offered and traded. This right can be traded and passed on, but, contrary to MP3 files, the vendor forfeits the benefit of this right at the moment it is passed on.\n\nSince the popularization of digital distribution platforms, it has become particularly common for games to feature paid content. Said content is often unlockable via online microtransactions. The act of payment may provide access to a previously restricted feature or content in the game, or permission to download additional content.\n\nIn comparison to content on the traditional internet, content for mobile services has never been free.\n\nThere is some evidence of opportunity for revenue already – custom publishing is one area proven to be thriving in the online media world. Another is the common payment system implemented in Slovakia and Slovenia by Piano Media. In this model publishers agree to go behind a paywall simultaneously and then start to charge the customer for access to all newspapers and all articles. While not all content is paid, exclusive content is and the model enables publishers who are unable to erect a pay-wall by themselves to start earning revenue outside of advertising from the internet.\n\nThe increased accessibility and interactivity of online journalism has also created new opportunity in the guise of crowdsourcing, enabling people to get investigative journalists working on stories that they themselves have suggested and funded.\n\nSome success in new models for paid content is being found in the use of paywalls, especially \"soft\" paywalls, which blend into freemium models. Newspapers, in particular, have been implementing paywalls in an attempt to increase revenue, which has been diminishing due to a decline in print subscriptions and advertising revenue. The approaches to paywall implementation range. For example, \"The New York Times\" experimented with a metered paywall, on which they spent a reported $40 million to code and took 14 months to implement. Other publications have turned to providers to implement a solution for them, such as Weekly World News, which announced in January 2013 that they would be utilizing a pay model.\n\nUse of pay what you want has also proven successful, at least for special promotions.\n\nPay After Reading (PAR) is a new business model and the principle for paid Internet content. This principle was applied for the first time by Slydoo on their Travel guides generator and means that the end users has access to information available in the database, not public, not free of charge, however, payment for the information occurs only after downloading / reading this information. The main reason for this approach is to overcome the natural block that has any user who should pay for the information / content without the detail knowledge of this information upfront. The author (Radomir Adamek) of this principle assumed that this model will become usual for most applications working with paid content.\n\n"}
{"id": "2308589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308589", "title": "Agility Association of Canada", "text": "Agility Association of Canada\n\nAgility Association of Canada (AAC) is a dog agility organization in Canada. Agility began in Canada when Art Newman, of North Gower, Ontario, founded what was then referred to as the Agility Dog Association of Canada in 1988. It quickly spread from central Ontario outwards to ultimately encompassing almost all of the provinces and territories. As of June 2005, there were 103 officially recognised membership clubs listed and hundreds of unofficial clubs thriving throughout Canada.\n\nThere are 3 performance levels in AAC agility - Starters, Advanced, and Masters. All dogs must start off at a Starters level and may only climb to the next level when they have achieved enough legs or \"Q's\" to complete a title. Once a title is completed they then must move up to the next level at the next trial they attend.\n\nThere are 3 class levels in AAC agility - Regular, Specials, and Veterans. Most dogs enter at a Regular class level in their respective height divisions. A dog may be moved to or start in the Specials division and will have to jump one height lower than what their Regular height would be. This is usually done in special circumstances such as when a dog measures just over its Regular height or the dog's build isn't conducive to performing at its Regular height. A dog may be entered in the Veterans division when they reach the age of 7 or if the dog is over the age of 5 and has been competing in Specials for a minimum of 12 months.\n\nThere are up to 6 height divisions available to compete in within the 3 class levels. The Regular class offers 8\", 12\" 16\", 20\" and 24\" height divisions. Specials and Veterans offers 4\" 8\" 12\" 16\" and 20\" height divisions. A dog will be measured at the highest point of its scapula to determine what height division it will compete in. The handler is given a choice of what division the dog will compete in according to the chart below:\n\nAAC offers 6 classes that a dog and handler can compete in: Standard, Steeplechase, and the games Gamblers, Jumpers, Snooker, and Team Relay.\n\nThe Standard Class is a course consisting of obstacles that must be performed in a set order under a specific time frame. In \"Starters\" the course must have a minimum of 15 obstacles and maximum of 17 obstacles with at least one change of handling and some minor obstacle discrimination. In \"Advanced\" the course must have a minimum of 17 obstacles and maximum of 19 obstacles with a greater amount of distance and directional control at a faster speed. A \"Masters\" course must have a minimum of 18 obstacles and maximum of 20 obstacles with the dog switching easily from side to side at a fast pace, discerning between major obstacle discriminations, and working at further distances with greater control.\n\nThe Challenge class is to provide a Standard course that test the speed and handling skills of the agility team at an international level. The course design for this class should reflect World Championship level Standard agility courses in their pace, difficulty and handling requirements. The dog and handler team must navigate the course as set by the judge, in accordance with current masters Standard performance rules. Only dogs eligible to compete in Masters Standard may enter the Challenge class for placement and qualifying scores. \n\nThe Steeplechase demonstrates a dog's ability to maintain a high speed while jumping along with performing the A-frame and weave poles with control. This class is run with the same number of obstacles as the Standard class. The Steeplechase must incorporate at least 6 jumps, a tunnel, the A-frame, 12 weaves poles, the tire jump, and the spread jump with either the weave poles or A-frame being used twice.\n\nGamblers involves accumulating as many points as possible via point-valued obstacles in the \"opening\" before having to perform the \"gamble\". The gamble involves executing the gamble obstacles in a prescribed order from a great distance fault free. If the dog successfully completes the gamble then the opening points will double. If a dog attempts the gamble but isn't successful then the opening points value will be kept. If a dog does not attempt the gamble in the required time a total of zero points will be awarded. Points in the opening sequence are as follows:\n\nThe gamble will be assigned a time of 40 seconds in the opening and 20 seconds or more for the \"Starters\" level, 18 seconds or more for the \"Advanced\" level, and 15 seconds or more for the \"Masters\" level. The gamble sequence must consist of 3 obstacles in \"Starters\", 3-4 obstacles in \"Advanced\", and 3-5 obstacles in \"Masters\". To qualify a Regular dog must achieve an opening point total 20 points in \"Starters/Advanced\" and 28 points in \"Masters\" while Veteran dogs must accumulate an opening point total 16 points in \"Starters/Advanced\" and 22 points in \"Masters\" along with successfully completing the gamble.\n\nJumpers involves a course of jumps and tunnels that will demonstrate the dog's natural jumping ability. To qualify the dog must complete the course fault free under the standard course time. In \"Starters\" traps (decoy jumps or tunnels) or not allowed whereas in \"Advanced\" and \"Masters\" traps are allowed along with weaves poles in the \"Masters\" level only.\n\nSnooker is derived from the billiard game of the same name. The object is to accumulate as many points as possible before the clock runs out. Each obstacle is assigned a specific point value from 2 to 7 with 3 or 4 red jumps interspersed throughout valued at 1 point. Obstacles numbered 2-7 must be laid out in a Standard course fashion to be attempted in the closing sequence. In the opening a dog must successfully complete a single red jump before moving onto one of the point obstacles then another red jump/obstacle combo and so on - all at the handler's choice. A red jump may only be taken once. If the red jump is faulted the dog must complete another red jump before attempting an obstacle of choice. After a minimum of 3 red jump/obstacle combinations the dog may then attempt the closing sequence and proceed to the finish line. To qualify and Regular \"Starters\" or \"Advanced\" dog must accumulate 37 points (Veteran dogs need 32 points) while a \"Masters\" dog must accumulate 40 points (Veterans need only 34 points).\n\nThe Team Relay consists of a team of 2, 3, or 4 dogs and handlers where each team member completes a section of a Standard course before passing a baton to the next team member who continues on with the next section of the course and so on. The baton is passed within an exchange box where those team members not running have to reside until the baton is passed off to them. To qualify all team members must run a clean round. In \"Starters\" and \"Advanced\" each dog is required to perform a minimum of 9 obstacles and no more than 10 obstacles with one contact and a set of 6 weave poles required on course. In \"Masters\" each dog is required to perform a minimum of 12 obstacles with one contact and a minimum of 10 weave poles required on course.\n\nThere are 11 titles that can awarded to a dog who completes the minimum requirements in its respective division and level. All of the titles can also be awarded to Special and Veteran level dogs with either an S or V preceding the title - hence a Special level dog could be awarded the Special Agility Dog of Canada (SADC) and a Veteran level dog could be awarded the Veteran Agility Dog of Canada (VADC).\n\nAfter the coveted ATChC/SATChC/VATChC is achieved a dog may then work towards the following awards using a combination of Master Standard classes, Master Games classes, and Steeplechase qualifying scores: \n\n"}

The quay is situated upstream from the mouth of the Singapore River and Boat Quay.\n\nClarke Quay was named after Sir Andrew Clarke, Singapore's second Governor and Governor of the Straits Settlements from 1873 to 1875, who played a key role in positioning Singapore as the main port for the Malay states of Perak, Selangor and Sungei Ujong. \n\nClarke Quay is also the name of a road along the quay, part of which has since been converted into a pedestrian mall. Clarke Street, located next to Clarke Quay, was officially named in 1896, and was originally two streets known simply as East Street and West Street in north Kampong Malacca. Similar to Clarke Quay, Clarke Street has since been converted into a pedestrian mall.\n\nThe Hoklos (Hokkien) refer to Clarke Street as \"gi hok kong si au\" (义福公司后), meaning \"behind the new Gi Hok Kongsi\" (house). The new Gi Hok Kongsi was near Carpenter Street. Another Chinese reference, which only refers to the Southern bank around Read Bridge area, was \"cha chun tau\" (柴船头), meaning \"jetty for boats carrying firewood\". Small \"tongkangs\" carrying firewood from Indonesia berthed at this jetty. The firewood trade was primarily a Teochew enterprise.\n\nThe Singapore River has been the centre of trade since modern Singapore was founded in 1819. During the colonial era, Boat Quay was the commercial centre where barge lighters would transport goods upstream to warehouses at Clarke Quay. \n\nAt the height of its prosperity, dozens of bumboats jostled for mooring space beside Clarke Quay. This continued well into the later half of the 20th century. By this time, the Singapore River had also become very polluted. The government decided to relocate cargo services to a new modern facility in Pasir Panjang. The bumboats and lorries departed to their new home and Clarke Quay fell silent.\n\nThe government then cleaned up the Singapore River and its environment from 1977 to 1987. Plans were made to revamp the area and turn it into a flourishing commercial, residential and entertainment precinct. These plans took into serious consideration the historical value of Clarke Quay, making it mandatory that new buildings complement the historical character of the area and that certain old buildings be restored.\nClarke Quay Festival Village, the biggest conservation project for the Singapore River, was developed and officially opened on 10 December 1993. In later years, Clarke Quay was managed and owned by CapitaLand. \n\nIn 1996, the advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi, and their sister company Zenith, moved into Clarke Quay as the pioneers to develop a creative hub. Two years later, they were awarded Ad Age International Agency of the Year. They had taken over the karaoke Party Doll premises. \n\nTen years later, works were commenced to revamp the Clarke Quay area to give the place a better tenant mix. The development also saw major changes to the exterior and riverside areas. \n\nAlsop Architects an International Architecture practice was commissioned to redesign the shophouse facades, streetscapes and riverfront dining areas in two development phases. The newly redeveloped Clarke Quay consistently attracts over 2 million visitors a year and is a major social and tourist component of brand Singapore. Crucial to its success is the ingenious moderation of the micro-climate through the design of sophisticated shading and cooling systems which reduce the ambient temperature by 4 degrees Celsius while enhancing the riverfront and streets with tremendous visual interests. The project won in 2007 Cityscape Architectural Review Award (Tourism, Travel & Transport – Built) and the Cityscape Asia Awards, Best Waterfront Development in 2008.\n\nThe Satay Club and a number of establishments vacated Clarke Quay to make way for new tenants. The upgraded Clarke Quay features the Zirca, The Clinic, Forbidden City by the Indochine Group and the whole development was completed in October 2006.\n\nThe Clarke Quay area at present is drastically different from the preservation/conservation effort from 1993.\n\nAt present, five blocks of restored warehouses house various restaurants and nightclubs. There are also moored Chinese junks (\"tongkangs\") that have been refurbished into floating pubs and restaurants. The Cannery is one of the anchor tenants of the place. There are over 5 different concepts in one block. Another anchor tenant, The Arena, will be home to Singapore's First Permanent Illusion Show (starting August 2008) starring J C Sum and 'Magic Babe' Ning. The G-MAX reverse bungee, the first in Singapore, is located at the entrance which opened in November 2003. Notable restaurants and nightclubs include Hooters and Indochine. River cruises and river taxis on the Singapore River can be accessed from Clarke Quay. One of its most popular attractions is its exciting host of CQ's signature events happening once every quarter. Clark Quay has become known as a hub of Singaporean nightclubs including Zirca, and up until 2008, the Ministry of Sound. Now it hosts the Singaporean nightlife institution, Zouk, after it moved from its previous home on Jiak Kim Road.\n\nClarke Quay MRT station on the North East line is located within the vicinity. A new SOHO concept development cum shopping centre called Clarke Quay Central, above the MRT station, was completed in 2007.\n\nIn July 2012, Hong Kong lifestyle retail store GOD opened a 6,000 square foot flagship store in the Quay.\nIt closed in 26 April 2015.\n\n\n"}

The capital of Mardin Province, it is known for the Artuqid (Artıklı or Artuklu in Turkish) architecture of its old city, and for its strategic location on a rocky hill near the Tigris River that rises steeply over the flat plains. The city has a Kurdish majority with a significant Arab and Assyrian population.\n\nThe territory of Mardin and Karaca Dağ was known as Izalla in the Late Bronze Age (variously: Azalzi, Azalli, Izalla), and originally part of a Hurrian kingdom.\n\nThe city and its surrounds were absorbed into Assyria proper during the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365-1020 BC), and then again during the Neo Assyrian Empire (911-605 BC).\n\nThe ancient name was rendered as \"Izalā\" in Old Persian, and during the Achaemenid Empire (546-332 BCE) according to the Behistun Inscription it was still regarded as an integral part of the geo-political entity of Assyria (Achaemenid Assyria, Athura).\n\nIt survived into the Assyrian Christian period as the name of Mt. Izala (Izla), on which in the early 4th century AD stood the monastery of Nisibis, housing seventy monks.\n\nIn the Roman period, the city itself was known as \"Marida\" (\"Merida\"), from a Syriac/Assyrian Neo-Aramaic language name translating to \"fortress\".\n\nBetween c.150 BC and 250 AD (apart from a brief Roman intervention when it became a part of Assyria (Roman province) it was part of the Neo-Assyrian kingdom of Osroene.\n\nIn the late 3rd century AD Shapur II conquered Mardin and Osroene into the Sassanid Empire (224-651 AD) after which the region became part of the province of Assuristan.\n\nByzantine Izala fell to the Seljuks in the 11th century. During the Artuqid period, many of Mardin's historic buildings were constructed, including several mosques, palaces, madrassas and khans. Mardin served as the capital of one of the two Artuqid branches during the 11th and 12th centuries. The lands of the Artukid dynasty fell to the Mongol invasion sometime between 1235 and 1243, but the Artuqids continued to govern as vassals of the Mongol Empire. \nDuring the battle of Ain Jalut in 1260, the Artuqid governor revolted against Mongol rule. Hulagu's general and Chupan's ancestor, Koke-Ilge of the Jalayir, stormed the city and Hulegu appointed the rebel's son, al-Nasir, governor of Mardin. \nAlthough, Hulagu suspected the latter's loyalty for a while, thereafter the Artuqids remained loyal unlike nomadic Bedouin and Kurd tribes in the south western frontier. The Mongol Ilkhanids considered them important allies. For this loyalty they showed, Artuqids were given more lands in 1298 and 1304. Mardin later passed to the Aq Qoyunlu, a federation of Turkic tribes that controlled territory all the way to the Caspian Sea.\n\nDuring the medieval period, the town (which retained significant Assyrian and Armenian populations) became the centre for episcopal sees of Armenian Apostolic, Armenian Catholic, Church of the East, Syriac Catholic, churches, as well as a stronghold of the Syriac Orthodox Church, whose patriarchal see was headquartered in the nearby Saffron Monastery from 1034 to 1924.In 1451 the Kara Koyunlu besieged the castle of Mardin, damaging the city after their failed attempt to take the stronghold. About half a century later, in 1507, Ismail I of the Safavids succeeded to capture the city and the castle. \n\nA few years later in 1515, the city yielded to the Ottomans, who were bitter rivals of the Safavid dynasty, though the castle still remained under the control of Ismail I. One year later, the Ottomans under the leadership of Selim I besieged the city anew and eventually annexed it in 1517. During this time, Mardin was administered by a governor directly appointed under the Ottoman Sultan's authority.\n\nThe city experienced a relatively tranquil period under Ottoman rule, without any significant conflicts or plights. This period of peace was finally halted when the Ottoman Empire came into conflict with the Khedivate of Egypt. During this time the city came under the rule of insurgents associated with the Milli clan. In 1835, the Milli tribe was subdued by the military troops of the Wāli of Diyarbekir Eyalet, Reşid Mehmed Pasha. Between 1847 and 1865 the city's population suffered from a notable cholera epidemic, with the exact number of fatalities not known. During World War I Mardin was one of the sites affected by the Armenian Genocide. On the eve of World War I, Mardin was home to over 12,000 Assyrians and over 7,500 Armenians. During the armed conflicts and plights caused by the war, many were sent to the Ras al-'Ayn Camps, though some managed to escape to the Sinjar Mountain with help from local Chechens. Kurds and Arabs of Mardin typically refer to these events as \"fırman\" (government order), while Syriacs call it \"seyfo\" (sword). After the Armistice of Mudros Mardin was one of the Turkish cities that was not occupied by the troops of the Allied Powers.\n\nIn 1923, with the founding of the Republic of Turkey, Mardin was made the administrative capital of a province named after it. Many Assyrian survivors of the violence later on left Mardin for nearby Qamishli in the 1940s after their conscription in the Turkish military became compulsory.\n\nThrough a passed law in 2012 Mardin became a metropolitan municipality, which took office after the Turkish local elections in 2014. \n\nA bishopric of the Assyrian Church of the East was centred on the town when it was part of the Roman province of Assyria. It was a suffragan see of [Edessa], the provincial [metropolitan see]. \nIt eventually became part of the Catholic Church in the late 17th century AD following a breakaway from the Assyrian Church, and is the (nominal) seat of three sees of the Catholic Church : the current Chaldean Catholic Eparchy of Mardin and two (now) titular sees under the ancient name of the town : former Armenian Catholic Archeparchy of Mardin, now Titular see of Mardin only, and former Syriac Catholic Eparchy of Mardin and Amida, now titular see (initially as mere Eparchy).\n\nMardin has often been considered an open-air museum due to its historical architecture. Most buildings use the beige colored limestone rock which has been mined for centuries in quarries around the area.\n\n\n\n\nIn the 2014 local elections, Ahmet Türk of the Democratic Regions Party (DBP) was elected mayor of Mardin. However, on 21 November 2016 he was detained on terror charges after being dismissed from his post by Turkish authorities. A trustee was appointed as mayor instead. In the Municipal elections in March 2019 he was re-elected. He was dismissed from his post in August 2019, accused of supporting terrorism. Mustafa Yaman, the Governor of Mardin Province was appointed as acting mayor. \n\nHistorically, Mardin produced sesame. Tourism is an important industry in Mardin.\n\nDuring the late Permian ~250 mya the Afro-Arabian plate started opening up. The East African continental rift initiation is believed to have started around 27-31 million years ago with the beginning of the basaltic volcanism of the Afar Plume. This rift system would cause a contractional tectonic process to occur in which the Arabian Plate was pushed in a north-easterly direction towards the Eurasian plate. The divergence in the East African Rift would eventually cause the closure of the Tethys Ocean as the Arabian Plate made its first inception of collision with Eurasia between 25-23 million years ago, and complete closure around 10 mya and creation of the Mardin High.\n\nMardin has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and cold, wet, and occasionally snowy winters. Temperatures in summer usually increase to due to Mardin being situated right next to the border of Syria. Snowfall is quite common between the months of December and March, snowing for a week or two. Mardin has over 3000 hours of sun per year. The highest recorded temperature is . Average rainfall is about 641.4 mm (25 inches) per year.\n\nMardin-Kızıltepe, with +48.8 °C (119.84 °F) on August 14, 1993, holds the record for the highest temperature ever recorded in Turkey.\n\n\nMardin is twinned with:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2308625", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308625", "title": "Boat Quay", "text": "Boat Quay\n\nBoat Quay is a historical quay in Singapore which is situated upstream from the mouth of the Singapore River on its southern bank. It spans from the shophouses near UOB Centre, stretching along one bank of the Singapore River, all the way till Elgin Bridge.\n\nIt was the busiest part of the old Port of Singapore, handling three-quarters of all shipping business during the 1860s. Because the south of the river here resembles the belly of a carp, which according to Chinese belief is where wealth and prosperity lay, many shophouses were built, crowded into the area.\n\nThough serving aquatic trade is no longer Boat Quay's primary role, the shophouses on it have been carefully conserved and now house various bars, pubs and restaurants. Therefore, Boat Quay's social-economic role in the city has shifted away from that of trade and maritime commerce, and now leans towards more of a role accommodated for tourism and aesthetics for the commercial zone of which encloses the Singapore River. It is the soft front to the cosmopolitan banking and financial sectors lying immediately behind it.\n\nBoat Quay is also the name of the road along the quay, which has since been converted into a pedestrian mall.\n\nSince the founding of modern Singapore in 1819, the Singapore River was the artery for much of the island's trade and economic activities. The south bank of the river, where most of the commerce took place, is known as Boat Quay.\n\nIn the 1820s, the area was swampy and built over with raft houses occupied by local traders. It was reclaimed with earth taken from a small hill where Commercial Square, now Raffles Place, stands.\n\nAs early as 1822, Sir Stamford Raffles had already designated the area south of the river to be developed as a Chinese settlement. Boat Quay was completed in 1842 and the Chinese, mostly traders and labourers, settled there in large numbers. Conditions were squalid but Boat Quay flourished, rapidly exceeding in volume the trade on the north bank where the Europeans had their offices, houses and government buildings.\n\nIn the midst of Boat Quay were the trading offices of some of Singapore's leading towkay (Hokkien for business owners) and philanthropists, such as Tan Tock Seng and Tan Kim Seng. The level of activity on the river was an indicator of the island's economic status. In prosperous times, hundreds of bumboats would fight for limited berthing space. Goods were carried from ships anchored in the river, to the road by lighters and coolies. Traders bought and sold many items, from raw materials such as rubber, tin, and steel, to perishables such as rice and coffee, and many other manufactured goods.\n\nBoat Quay was very resilient to change. Its role did not diminish even when a new harbour was built at Tanjong Pagar in 1852. On the contrary, it continued to grow, spurred on by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, when steamships started calling at the port of Singapore. In fact, during that period, three-quarters of Singapore's overall trading business was transacted from Boat Quay.\n\nIts decline really began in the 1960s, as mechanisation and computerisation gradually usurped the bumboat's role in the shipping industry. In September 1983, the government opened a modern, high-tech cargo centre in Pasir Panjang. This led to the rapid demise of Boat Quay's river trade, as the highly mechanised container port replaced the laborious and hazardous lighter system. Therefore, during the mid-1980s, after all the trading companies had moved out and the lighters removed, Boat Quay was devoid of activity, with the river deserted.\n\nBoat Quay is now a business, dining, nightlife, and entertainment district for a mixture of locals, Western expats, and Western, Asian, and global tourists.\n\nThe Singapore government cleaned-up the river in 1983 and moved the remaining shipping industry's lighters were moved to a new quay near Pasir Panjang. Therefore, the Boat Quay was deserted and unused from 1983 to 1989.\n\nIn 1986, the Urban Redevelopment Authority announced plans to preserve Boat Quay as part of a master plan for conserving the whole of the Singapore River and its environs.\n\nOn 7 July 1989, an area encompassing South Bridge Road, Circular Road, Lorong Telok and North Canal Road was gazetted. The two- and three-storey shophouses in that area, with their characteristic five-foot way beneath projecting upper floors, were preserved and transformed into new businesses. The shophouses and godowns along the river bank were restored in the 1990s and are now bustling shops, restaurants and bars.\n\nWhen the area became a conservation area in 1989, redevelopment began and by 1993 all historic shophouses were under reconstruction. The Singapore Urban Redevelopment Authority issued stringent guidelines for the restoration but did not provide cash grants or tax relief for conservation projects but waived some of the development charges, car parking requirements and car park deficiency charges.\n\nThe historic shophouses could now easily be re-used for modern businesses, such as restaurants, cafes, bars and small shops. The interior of the buildings could be modified with the new use in mind, in some cases using new non-traditional interior ornamentation, materials, and colours. For instance, the interior of the Opera Cafe at No. 40 Boat Quay was modified to create an ambiance similar to an opera stage-set. The ground floor of the Lim Family Shophouse at No. 58 Boat Quay was converted into a Japanese restaurant. The upper floor is used as a weekend flat for the Lim family, who lived in the building since 1908. The architect Mok Wei Wei created more open space by demolishing some of the original partition walls, but kept and restored the original teak floors, paint colour on the window frames, wooden balcony doors, and tile roofs. The historic blackwood furniture and art pieces were also restored and re-used.\n\nMultiple startup companies also rent offices around the Boat Quay and nearby Circular Road area.\n\nBoat Quay is one of the early roads established when the Singapore River was the main port area of the colonial city. In the 19th century, the Chinese had several names for this road, referring to different sections of it:\n\nSome of the quay's colloquial English names included:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2308627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308627", "title": "Motion aftereffect", "text": "Motion aftereffect\n\nThe motion aftereffect (MAE) is a visual illusion experienced after viewing a moving visual stimulus for a time (tens of milliseconds to minutes) with stationary eyes, and then fixating a stationary stimulus. The stationary stimulus appears to move in the opposite direction to the original (physically moving) stimulus. The motion aftereffect is believed to be the result of motion adaptation.\n\nFor example, if one looks at a waterfall for about a minute and then looks at the stationary rocks at the side of the waterfall, these rocks appear to be moving upwards slightly. The illusory upwards movement is the motion aftereffect. This particular motion aftereffect is also known as the \"waterfall illusion\".\n\nAnother example can be seen when one looks at the center of a rotating spiral for several seconds. The spiral can exhibit outward or inward motion. When one then looks at any stationary pattern, it appears to be moving in the opposite direction. This form of the motion aftereffect is known as the \"spiral aftereffect\".\n\nNeurons coding a particular movement reduce their responses with time of exposure to a constantly moving stimulus; this is neural adaptation. Neural adaptation also reduces the spontaneous, baseline activity of these same neurons when responding to a stationary stimulus (see, for example, Barlow & Hill, 1963; Srinivasan & Dvorak, 1979; Glasser, Tsui, Pack, & Tadin, 2011). One theory is that perception of stationary objects, for example rocks beside a waterfall, is coded as the balance among the baseline responses of neurons coding all possible directions of motion. Neural adaptation of neurons stimulated by downward movement reduces their baseline activity, tilting the balance in favor of upward movement.\n\nAristotle (approx. 350 B.C.) reported illusory movement after viewing constant movement, but did not specify its direction. The first clear specification of the motion aftereffect was by Jan Evangelista Purkyně (1820) who observed it after looking at a cavalry parade. Robert Addams (1834) reported the waterfall illusion after observing it at the Falls of Foyers in Scotland. According to Verstraten (1996) the term waterfall illusion was coined by Thompson (1880). According to Wade, Thompson, and Morgan, (2014), the most comprehensive single article on the phenomenon is by Gustav Adolf Wohlgemuth (1911) https://archive.org/details/onaftereffectofs01wohl .\n\n\n\n\n"}

It stars Kōji Yakusho, Aoi Miyazaki, and Masaru Miyazaki. It won the FIPRESCI Prize and Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival. It was released in Japan on 20 January 2001.\n\n\"Eureka\" is a drama set mainly in rural Kyushu, Japan, and is almost entirely shot in sepia tone. It tells the story of the lasting effects of a violent experience on three people, a teenage brother and sister, Naoki and Kozue Tamura and a bus driver, Makoto Sawai. These three are the sole survivors after the bus is hijacked by a gunman. The actual violent events which traumatise them are not shown in detail. The extent to which the three have been affected slowly becomes apparent. Naoki and Kozue do not return to school, do not speak and become dissociated from their parents. Some time after the hijack, their mother abandons the family. Later their father is killed in a car crash. It is not clear whether his death is suicide. The two children continue to live alone in the family home. Meanwhile, Makoto is finding it impossible to carry on normal life and takes to the road, leaving his estranged wife living in the family home with his elderly father, elder brother, his wife and their daughter. After some time, Makoto returns home to find that his wife has left him. He cannot return to driving a bus and takes a job as a day-labourer with an old school-friend.\n\nRelationships between Makoto and his brother begin to deteriorate and Makoto moves in with Naoki and Kozue. He takes over the housekeeping and makes sure they eat properly. Kozue now begins to communicate a little but Naoki remains mute. The detective who dealt with the hijacking begins to harass Makoto about the murder of a woman in the neighbourhood, apparently without any evidence. While Makoto is out at work one day, the children's older student cousin Akihiko arrives and states he intends to stay to look after the children. He and Makoto are uneasy with each other but the four people settle down into a kind of family arrangement.\n\nA further murder takes place and this time the victim is a friend of Makoto's. He is arrested and questioned by the detective but is finally released. He talks to his friend and co-worker about his wish to return to driving and forms a plan to get all of them, Naoki, Kozue, Akihiko and himself away from their troubles. He buys an old bus which they convert for living accommodation and they all set off on an extended tour of the island. Kozue becomes more relaxed as they travel around but Naoki appears more disturbed. It eventually becomes clear that it is Naoki who is the murderer. Makoto confronts him and persuades him to give himself up. The remaining three carry on with the journey until Makoto finally loses his temper with Akihiko's cynical and shallow outlook and throws him off the bus. Makoto and Kozue continue on their journey until, finally, when they reach the peak of the highest mountain in Kyushu, both realise they are able to face ordinary life again. As they reach this understanding the film briefly turns to colour.\n\nFor \"Eureka\", writer and director Shinji Aoyama got inspiration from the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin attack. According to \"The Guardian\", his research \"also took in accounts of Holocaust survivors and studies of Israeli terrorists, as well as his own experiences of growing up in a society of widening generation gaps.\" Aoyama stated that he was influenced by Alain Resnais's film \"Hiroshima mon amour\", John Ford's film \"The Searchers\", Sonic Youth's album \"Daydream Nation\", and Jim O'Rourke's album \"Eureka\". The film was shot in black-and-white and printed in color. Filming took place in Kyushu. The last scene was shot near the volcano Mount Aso.\n\nThe film had its world premiere in the Competition section at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival on 18 May 2000. It was released in Japan on 20 January 2001.

It is located in the southern slope of the east hill. The cave's beauty comes from its many varieties of mineral formations called speleothems. The Chicago Academy of Sciences considers the Cave of the Mounds to be \"the significant cave of the upper Midwest\" because of its beauty, and it is promoted as the \"jewel box\" of major American caves. In 1987, the United States Department of the Interior and the National Park Service designated the cave as a National Natural Landmark.\n\nThe limestone from which the cave was carved began forming approximately 488 million years ago, during the Ordovician Period. During this time, much of North America was covered with warm, shallow seas. Over millions of years, calcium carbonate shells from tiny marine organisms accumulated on the sea floor, forming enormous quantities of limestone. The type of limestone in which the cave was formed is called galena dolomite because of its high concentration of the lead ore galena.\n\nThe cave began forming about a million to a million and a half years ago, in a manner similar to many caves. A large crack in the surface of the rock, called the cave's \"lifeline\", allowed rain water to seep into the stone. In the air, rain combines with carbon dioxide to form a weak carbonic acid. Though this acid is not very strong, it is strong enough to dissolve away the limestone after it seeps in through the \"lifeline\". Over time, large cavities were dissolved in the stone and as the water table dropped, the water drained out and the cavities filled with air. Now that the cavities are filled with air instead of water, the water droplets coming from the \"lifeline\", which are saturated with dissolved calcium carbonate, deposit solid calcium carbonate, which builds up over time to create speleothems. This is a very gradual process, usually taking 50 to 150 years to form one cubic inch of material, and continues to this day.\n\nThe area around the Blue Mounds, Dane County, was first settled by Europeans in 1828 by Ebenezer Brigham, a successful lead miner from Massachusetts. He had traveled to Wisconsin to join in the lead rush of the late 1820s. After arriving, he set up operations just north of where the cave lies today. Ebenezer's house later became a trading post, an inn, a stagecoach stop, and the first post office in Dane County. Ebenezer Brigham later became a colonel and helped build and command Fort Blue Mounds during the Blackhawk War. He died after a long life, not knowing that a beautiful cave existed beneath his Brigham Farm.\n\nOn August 4, 1939, Cave of the Mounds was discovered accidentally when limestone quarry workers blasted a section of the quarry and exposed an opening to the cave. Work at the quarry then immediately stopped and was never continued. Soon after, the cave was closed to prevent damage from curious souvenir seekers who removed pieces of stalactites and stalagmites to take home. There are still foot-sized holes in the flowstone left by these early explorers. The cave was reopened in May, 1940, after lights and wooden walkways had been installed. Since then, the wooden walkways have been replaced with concrete ones to accommodate the many visitors. Theatrical lighting has also been installed to further highlight the colors and shapes inside the cave. In 1987, the cave was designated a National Natural Landmark by the United States Department of the Interior and the National Park Service. To be considered a NNL, \"a site must be one of the best examples of a natural region's characteristic biotic or geologic features.\"\n\nCave of the Mounds is home to many varieties of speleothems. As with most caves, stalactites and stalagmites are common. Formations found inside the cave include:\n\nThese formations come in many different brilliant colors such as reds, browns, blues, and grays. The reds and browns are caused by the presence of iron oxide in the formation. Similarly, blues and grays are caused by manganese oxide. Some speleothems are even partially luminescent and give off light for a brief period after exposure to another light.\n\nThe cave is located 20 miles west of Madison, off U.S. Highways 18/151 in Blue Mounds, Wisconsin. Since its opening in 1940, the cave has hosted millions of tourists.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his work on the history of the Hangul alphabet.\n\nLedyard was born while his family happened to be in Syracuse for work during the Depression. He grew up in Detroit and Ann Arbor, Michigan, and moved with his family to San Rafael, California in 1948. After high school, he attended the University of Michigan and San Francisco State College, but did not do well, and in 1953 he joined the army to avoid the draft. Luckily, he missed so much basic training due to illness that he had to repeat it, and during that time opportunities opened up for language training, one of his interests.\n\nHe was scheduled for one year intensive Russian language training at the Army Language School in Monterey, but was soon reassigned to Korean. He graduated too high in his class to be sent to Korea, but after a few months was able to get a posting in Tokyo in July, 1955, and then a transfer to Seoul in November. While there he looked up the families of his Korean teachers, ate in town, and taught at the American Language Institute. When his superiors found out, he was accused of fraternization and reassigned to Tokyo, after only nine months in Korea, and returned to the US in December.\n\nThe next spring he enrolled in the University of California at Berkeley, in Chinese language and literature, studying under, among others, Peter Alexis Boodberg and Zhao Yuanren, as there was no Korean Studies program in the United States at the time. For his bachelor's degree in 1958 he translated the \"Hunmin Jeongeum Haerye\" into English; for his master's degree in 1963 he documented early Korean–Mongol diplomatic relations; and with a year for research in Seoul for his dissertation, he received his PhD in 1966 and a position at Columbia, at the Centre for Korean Research, succeeding William E. Skillend. He was made a full professor in 1977, and retired in 2001.\n\nLedyard's dissertation was \"The Korean Language Reform of 1446,\" on King Sejong's alphabet project, but concerned with the political implications and controversies of hangul as much as its creation. Unfortunately, he failed to copyright his dissertation, and it was distributed in microfilm and photocopy, so that he could not copyright it and publish without substantial revision. He was finally convinced to do so by the first director of the National Academy of the Korean Language, Lee Ki-Moon, and the book was published in Korea in 1998.\n\nHe has also published on Korean cartography, the alliance between Korea and China during the first Japanese invasions, and the relationship between the wars of the Three Kingdoms and the founding of the Japanese state from Korea. He also wrote a book about the journal written by the 17th century Dutch explorer Hendrick Hamel who was held hostage in Korea for 13 years. The title of this book is 'The Dutch come to Korea' and was first published in 1971. He was invited to visit North Korea in 1988.\n\nLedyard believes, following, French orientalist, Jean-Pierre Abel-Rémusat in 1820, that the basic hangul consonants were adopted from the Mongolian Phagspa script of the Yuan dynasty, known as the 蒙古篆字 \"měnggǔ zhuānzì\" (Mongol seal script).\n\nOnly five letters were adopted from Phagspa, with most of the rest of the consonants created by featural derivation from these, as described in the account in the \"Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye\". However, which letters the basic consonants were differs between the two accounts. Whereas the \"Haerye\" implies that the graphically simplest letters ㄱㄴㅁㅅㅇ are basic, with others derived from them by the addition of strokes (though with ㆁㄹㅿ set apart), Ledyard believes the five phonologically simplest letters ㄱㄷㄹㅂㅈ, which were basic in Chinese phonology, were also basic to hangul, with strokes either added or subtracted to derive the other letters. It was these five core letters which were taken from the Phagspa script, and ultimately derive from the Tibetan letters ག ད ལ བ ས. Thus they may be cognate with Greek Γ Δ Λ Β and the letters C/G D L B of the Latin alphabet. (The history of the S sounds between Tibetan and Greek is more difficult to reconstruct.) A sixth basic letter, ㅇ, was an invention, as in the \"Haerye\" account.\n\nThe creation of the vowel letters is essentially the same in the two accounts.\n\nThe \"Hunmin Jeong-eum\" credits the 古篆字 \"\"Gu\" Seal Script\" as being the source King Sejong or his ministers used to create hangul. This has traditionally been interpreted as the \"Old\" Seal Script, and has confused philologists because hangul bears no functional similarity to the Chinese seal scripts. However, 古 \"gǔ\" had more than one meaning: besides meaning \"old\", it could be used to refer to the Mongols (蒙古 \"Měng-gǔ\"). Records from Sejong's day played with this ambiguity, joking that \"no one is more \"gu\" than the \"Meng-gu\"\". That is, \"Gu Seal Script\" may have been a veiled reference to the Mongol Seal Script, or Phagspa alphabet. (\"Seal script\" is a style of writing, used for name seals and official stamps. Phagspa had a seal script variant modeled after the appearance of the Chinese seal script of its day. In this guise it was called the 蒙古篆字 Mongol Seal Script, with only the initial character distinguishing it from the 古篆字 credited by the \"Hunmin Jeong-eum\" as the source of hangul.) There were many Phagspa manuscripts in the Korean palace library, and several of Sejong's ministers knew the script well.\n\nIf this were the case, Sejong's evasion on the Mongol connection can be understood in light of Korea's relationship with China after the fall of the Yuan dynasty, as well as the Korean literati's contempt for the Mongols as \"barbarians\". Indeed, such China-centered resistance kept hangul out of common use until the dawn of the twentieth century.\n\nAlthough several of the basic concepts of hangul came from Indic phonology through the Phagspa script, such as the relationships among the homorganic consonants and, of course, the alphabetic principle itself, Chinese phonology also played a major role. Besides the grouping of letters into syllables, along the lines of Chinese characters, it was Chinese phonology, not Indic, that determined which five consonants were basic, and therefore to be retained from Phagspa. These were the tenuis (non-voiced, non-aspirated) plosives, \"g\" for ㄱ , \"d\" for ㄷ , and \"b\" for ㅂ , which were basic to Chinese theory, but which were voiced in the Indic languages and not considered basic; as well as the sibilant \"s\" for ㅈ and the liquid \"l\" for ㄹ . (Korean ㅈ was pronounced in the 15th century.)\n\nThe basic hangul letters have been simplified graphically, retaining the essential shape of Phagspa but with a reduced number of strokes. For example, the box inside Phagspa \"g\" is not found in hangul ㄱ [k]. This simplification allowed for complex clusters, but also left room for an additional stroke to derive the aspirate plosives, ㅋㅌㅍㅊ. On the other hand, the non-plosives, nasals \"ng\" (see below) ㄴㅁ and the fricative ㅅ, were derived by \"removing\" the top of the tenuis letter. (No letters were derived from ㄹ.) This clears up a few points. For example, it's easy to derive ㅁ from ㅂ by removing the top of ㅂ, but it's not clear how you'd get ㅂ by adding something to ㅁ, since ㅂ is not analogous to the other plosives: if they were derived, as in the traditional account, we'd expect them all to have a similar vertical top stroke.\n\nSejong also needed a null symbol to refer to the lack of a consonant, and he chose the circle, ㅇ. The subsequent derivation of the glottal stop ㆆ, by adding a vertical top stroke by analogy with the other plosives, and the aspirate ㅎ parallel the account in the \"Hunmin Jeong-eum\". The phonetic theory inherent in this derivation is more accurate than modern IPA usage. In the IPA, the glottal consonants are posited as having a specific \"glottal\" place of articulation. However, recent phonetic theory has come to view the glottal stop and [h] to be isolated features of 'stop' and 'aspiration' without a true place of articulation, just as their hangul representations based on the null symbol assume.\n\nThe \"ng\" is the odd letter out here, as it is in the \"Hunmin Jeong-eum\". This may reflect its variable behavior. Hangul was designed not just to write Korean, but to accurately represent Chinese. Besides the letters covered here, there were quite a few more used to represent Chinese etymology. Now, many Chinese words began with \"ng\", at least historically, and this was being lost in several regions of China by Sejong's day: that is, etymological \"ng\" was either silent or pronounced in China, and was silent when borrowed into Korean. The expected shape of \"ng\" had the additional problem that, by being just the vertical line left by removing the top stroke of ㄱ, it would have been easily confused with the vowel ㅣ . Sejong's solution solved both these problems: the vertical stroke from ㄱ was added to the null symbol ㅇ to create ᇰ, graphically representing both regional pronunciations as well as being easily legible. (If your browser doesn't display this, it's a circle with a vertical line on top, like an upside-down keyhole or lollipop.) Thus ᇰ was pronounced \"ng\" in the middle or end of a word, but was silent at the beginning. Eventually the graphic distinction between the two silent initials ㅇ and ᇰ was lost.\n\nTwo additional details lend credence to Ledyard's hypothesis. For one, the composition of obsolete ᇢᇦᇴ \"w, v, f\" (for Chinese initials 微非敷), from the graphic derivatives of the basic letter ㅂ \"b\" [p] (that is, ㅁㅂㅍ \"m, b, p\") by adding a small circle under them, is parallel to their Phagspa equivalents, which were similarly derived by adding a small loop under three graphic variants of the letter \"h\". Now, this small loop also represented \"w\" when it occurred after vowels in Phagspa. The Chinese initial 微 represented either \"m\" or \"w\" in various dialects, and this may be reflected in the choice of ㅁ [m] plus ㅇ (from Phagspa [w]) as the elements of hangul ᇢ. Not only is the series ᇢᇦᇴ analogous to Phagspa, but here we may have a second example of a letter composed of two elements to represent two regional pronunciations, \"m\" and \"w\", as we saw with ᇰ for \"ng\" and \"null\".\n\nSecondly, most of the basic hangul letters were originally simple geometric shapes. For example, ㄱ was the corner of a square, ㅁ a full square, ㅅ was a caret-like Λ, ㅇ was a circle. In the \"Hunmin Jeong-eum\", before the influence from Chinese calligraphy on hangul, these are purely geometric. However, ㄷ was different. It wasn't a simple half square, like we might expect if Sejong had simply created it \"ex nihilo\". Rather, even in the \"Hunmin Jeong-eum\", it had a small lip protruding from the upper left corner. This lip duplicates the shape of Phagspa \"d\" [t], and can be traced back to the Tibetan letter \"d\", ད.\n\nThe seven basic vowel letters were not taken from Phagspa, but rather seem to have been invented by Sejong or his ministers to represent the phonological principles of Korean. Two methods were used to organize and classify these vowels, vowel harmony and iotation.\n\nOf the seven vowels, four could be preceded by a \"y-\" sound (\"iotized\"). These four were written as a dot next to a line: ㅓㅏㅜㅗ. (Through the influence of Chinese calligraphy, the dots soon became connected to the line, as seen here.) Iotation was then indicated by doubling this dot: ㅕㅑㅠㅛ. The three vowels which could not be yotized were written with a single stroke: ㅡㆍㅣ.\n\nThe Korean language of this period had vowel harmony to a greater extent than it does today. Vowels alternated according to their environment, and fell into \"harmonic\" groups. This affected the morphology of the language, and Korean phonology described it in terms of \"yin\" and \"yang\": If a word had \"yang\" ('bright') vowels, then most suffixes also had to have a \"yang\" vowel; and conversely, if the root had \"yin\" ('dark') vowels, the suffixes needed to be \"yin\" as well. There was a third group called \"mediating\" ('neutral' in Western terminology) that could coexist with either \"yin\" or \"yang\" vowels.\n\nThe Korean neutral vowel was ㅣ \"i\". The \"yin\" vowels were ㅡㅜㅓ \"eu, u, eo\"; the dots are in the \"yin\" directions of 'down' and 'left'. The \"yang\" vowels were ㆍㅗㅏ, \"ə, o, a\", with the dots in the \"yang\" directions of 'up' and 'right'. The \"Hunmin Jeong-eum\" states that the shapes of the non-dotted letters ㅡㆍㅣ were also chosen to represent the concepts of \"yin\" (flat earth), \"yang\" (sun in heaven), and mediation (upright man). (The letter ㆍ \"ə\" is now obsolete.)\n\nThere was a third parameter in designing the vowel letters, namely, choosing ㅡ as the graphic base of ㅜ and ㅗ, and ㅣ as the base of ㅓ and ㅏ. A full understanding of what these horizontal and vertical groups had in common would require knowing the exact sound values these vowels had in the 15th century. Our uncertainty is primarily with the letters ㆍㅓㅏ. Some linguists reconstruct these as , respectively; others as . However, the horizontal letters ㅡㅜㅗ do appear to have all represented mid to high back vowels, .\n\nLedyard, Gari K. \"The Korean Language Reform of 1446\".

The question put before the Court was whether there was an implied trust on behalf of the wife for all her years of labour on the ranch.\n\nIn a 4-1 decision, a majority of the Court dismissed the wife's application. Speaking for the majority, Justice Martland upheld the trial judge's finding that the wife's labour was not beyond what was normally expected of a ranch wife. Martland J. held that since there was no financial contribution nor intention to create a trust, there could be no resulting trust, relying on a similar English case, \"Gissing v. Gissing\".\n\nIn dissent, Laskin J. argued that the Court did not need to examine intent in order to find a trust; rather a constructive trust based in equity could be found.\n\nLaskin's dissent proved to be among his most famous. Many scholars, himself included, believed that his dissent was a major factor in his unexpected promotion to Chief Justice several years later.\n\nCanadian feminists publicized the case across the country.

The film features a cast of Native American and Indigenous Mexican actors consisting of Rudy Youngblood, Raoul Trujillo, Mayra Sérbulo, Dalia Hernández, Ian Uriel, Gerardo Taracena, Rodolfo Palacios, Bernardo Ruiz Juarez, Ammel Rodrigo Mendoza, Ricardo Diaz Mendoza, and Israel Contreras. Similar to Gibson's earlier film \"The Passion of the Christ\", all dialogue is in a modern approximation of the ancient language of the setting. Here, the Indigenous Yucatec Maya language is spoken, with subtitles, which sometimes refer to the language as Mayan. This was the last film Gibson directed until 2016's \"Hacksaw Ridge\" ten years later.\n\nSet in Yucatán, Mexico, around the year 1502, \"Apocalypto\" portrays the hero's journey of a young man named Jaguar Paw, a late Mesoamerican hunter and his fellow tribesmen who are captured by an invading force. After the devastation of their village, they are brought on a perilous journey to a Mayan city for human sacrifice at a time when the Maya civilization is in decline. The film was a box office success, grossing over $120 million worldwide, and received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising Gibson's direction, Dean Semler's cinematography, the performances of the cast, and the portrayal of Mayan civilization.\n\nAll of the ethnic tribes and peoples depicted in the film were Maya, as Gibson wanted to depict the Maya city built for the story as an \"Unknown world\" to the character. \n\nWhile hunting in the Mesoamerican rainforest, Jaguar Paw, his father Flint Sky, and their fellow tribesmen encounter a procession of refugees fleeing warfare. The group's leader explains that their lands were ravaged and they seek a new beginning. He asks for permission to pass through the jungle. Flint Sky comments to his son that the visitors were sick with fear and urges him to never allow fear to infect him.\n\nAt sunrise the next morning, the tribe's village is raided by a group led by Zero Wolf. Huts are set on fire, many villagers are killed, and the rest of the adults are taken captive. Jaguar Paw nearly kills the sadistic raider Middle Eye, who kills the captive Flint Sky in retaliation and names Jaguar Paw \"Almost\". Jaguar Paw's heavily pregnant wife Seven and their young son Turtles Run escape by hiding in a small natural pit cave that also serves as a water reservoir, but are left trapped when Jaguar Paw is captured. The raiders then lead the captives on a long forced march through the jungle, leaving the children behind to fend for themselves.\n\nOn the journey, Cocoa Leaf, a badly wounded captive, is killed by Middle Eye, eliciting anger from Zero Wolf, who threatens his fellow raider with death if he kills another captive without permission. As the party approaches the Mayan city from which the raiders come, they encounter razed forests and failed maize crops, along with villages decimated by an unknown disease. A little girl infected with the illness prophesies Zero Wolf's death and the end of the Mayan world. Once the raiders and captives reach the city the females are sold as slaves while the males are escorted to the top of a step pyramid to be sacrificed before the Mayan King and Queen.\n\nAs a result of a solar eclipse and the superstitions surrounding it, Jaguar Paw and the remaining captives are spared from being sacrificed. Instead, they are taken to be used as target practice by Zero Wolf and his men, and offered their freedom if they can run to safety before being killed. Jaguar Paw is injured but kills Zero Wolf's son Cut Rock, and escapes into the jungle. Zero Wolf and eight of his comrades chase after him in vengeance. Back in his native jungle, Jaguar Paw now has the advantage and taunts his pursuers. Most of the hunters—including Zero Wolf and Middle Eye—are gradually killed off via natural hazards and traps laid out by Jaguar Paw, until there are only two left.\n\nThe drought breaks and heavy rain begins to fall, threatening to drown Jaguar Paw's family, who are still trapped in the pit cave despite their attempts to escape. Seven gives birth to another son, who is born into the now dangerously rising water. Meanwhile, the two remaining raiders chase Jaguar Paw out of the undergrowth towards the coast. As they reach the beach, all three are stopped in their tracks by the sight of conquistador ships anchored off the coast and Spaniards making their way ashore, holding up a large cross. Jaguar Paw flees while the two raiders remain, seemingly mesmerized at the conquerors' presence. Jaguar Paw returns in time to save his family from the flooded pit and is overjoyed at the sight of his new baby son.\n\nSometime later, as the reunited family looks out over the water at the Spanish ships, Jaguar Paw decides not to risk approaching the conquerors, insisting his family head back into the jungle. They depart in search of a new home and a new beginning.\n\nScreenwriter and co-producer Farhad Safinia first met Mel Gibson while working as an assistant during the post-production of \"The Passion of the Christ\". Eventually, Gibson and Safinia found time to discuss \"their mutual love of movies and what excites them about moviemaking\".\n\nGibson said they wanted to \"shake up the stale action-adventure genre\", which he felt was dominated by CGI, stock stories and shallow characters and to create a footchase that would \"feel like a car chase that just keeps turning the screws.\"\n\nGibson and Safinia were also interested in portraying and exploring an ancient culture as it existed before the arrival of the Europeans. Considering both the Aztecs and the Maya, they eventually chose the Maya for their high sophistication and their eventual decline.\n\nThe two researched ancient Maya history, reading both creation and destruction myths, including sacred texts such as the \"Popul Vuh.\" In the audio commentary of the film's first DVD release, Safinia states that the old shaman's story (played by Espiridion Acosta Cache, a modern-day Maya storyteller) was modified from an authentic Mesoamerican tale that was re-translated by Hilario Chi Canul, a professor of Maya, into the Yucatec Maya language for the film. He also served as a dialogue coach during production. As they researched the script, Safinia and Gibson traveled to Guatemala, Costa Rica and the Yucatán peninsula to scout filming locations and visit Maya ruins.\n\nStriving for a degree of historical accuracy, the filmmakers employed a consultant, Richard D. Hansen, a specialist in the Maya and assistant professor of archaeology at Idaho State University. As director of the Mirador Basin Project, he works to preserve a large swath of the Guatemalan rain forest and its Maya ruins. Gibson has said of Hansen's involvement: \"Richard's enthusiasm for what he does is infectious. He was able to reassure us and make us feel secure that what we were writing had some authenticity as well as imagination.\"\n\nOther scholars of Mesoamerican history criticized the film for what they said were numerous inaccuracies. A number of scholars have also risen to defend the film citing ignorance or political correctness as the primary motivator for the criticisms. A recent essay by Hansen on the film and a critical commentary on the criticisms of the film is now published.\n\nGibson decided that all the dialogue would be in the Yucatec Maya language. Gibson explains: \"I think hearing a different language allows the audience to completely suspend their own reality and get drawn into the world of the film. And more importantly, this also puts the emphasis on the cinematic visuals, which are a kind of universal language of the heart.\"\n\nThe production team consisted of a large group of make-up artists and costume designers who worked to recreate the Maya look for the large cast. Led by Aldo Signoretti, the make-up artists daily applied the required tattoos, scarification, and earlobe extensions to all of the on-screen actors. According to advisor Richard D. Hansen, the choices in body make-up were based on both artistic license and fact: \"I spent hours and hours going through the pottery and the images looking for tattoos. The scarification and tattooing was all researched, the inlaid jade teeth are in there, the ear spools are in there. There is a little doohickey that comes down from the ear through the nose into the septum – that was entirely their artistic innovation.\" An example of attention to detail is the left arm tattoo of Seven, Jaguar Paw's wife, which is a horizontal band with two dots above – the Mayan symbol for the number seven.\n\nSimon Atherton, an English armorer and weapon-maker who worked with Gibson on \"Braveheart\", was hired to research and provide reconstructions of Maya weapons. Atherton also has a cameo as the cross-bearing Franciscan friar who appears on a Spanish ship at the end of the film.\n\nMel Gibson wanted \"Apocalypto\" to feature sets with buildings rather than relying on computer-generated images. Most of the step pyramids seen at the Maya city were models designed by Thomas E. Sanders. Sanders explained his approach: \"We wanted to set up the Mayan world, but we were not trying to do a documentary. Visually, we wanted to go for what would have the most impact. Just as on \"Braveheart\", you are treading the line of history and cinematography. Our job is to do a beautiful movie.\"\n\nHowever, while many of the architectural details of Maya cities are correct, they are blended from different locations and eras, a decision Farhad Safinia said was made for aesthetic reasons. While \"Apocalypto\" is set during the terminal post-classic period of Maya civilization, the central pyramid of the film comes from the classic period, which ended in A.D. 900, such as those found in the Postclassic sites of Muyil, Coba, and others in Quintana Roo, Mexico, where later cities are built around earlier pyramids. The temples are in the shape of those of Tikal in the central lowlands classic style but decorated with the Puuc style elements of the northwest Yucatán centuries later. Richard D. Hansen comments, \"There was nothing in the post-classic period that would match the size and majesty of that pyramid in the film. But Gibson ... was trying to depict opulence, wealth, consumption of resources.\" The mural in the arched walkway combined elements from the Maya codices, the Bonampak murals (over 700 years earlier than the film's setting), and the San Bartolo murals (some 1500 years earlier than the film's setting).\n\nGibson filmed \"Apocalypto\" mainly in Catemaco, San Andrés Tuxtla and Paso de Ovejas in the Mexican state of Veracruz. The waterfall scene was filmed at Eyipantla Falls, located in San Andrés Tuxtla. Other filming by second-unit crews took place in El Petén, Guatemala. The film was originally slated for an August 4, 2006, release, but Touchstone Pictures delayed the release date to December 8, 2006, due to heavy rains and two hurricanes interfering with filming in Mexico. Principal photography ended in July 2006.\n\n\"Apocalypto\" was shot on high-definition digital video, using the Panavision Genesis camera. During filming, Gibson and cinematographer Dean Semler employed Spydercam, a suspended camera system allowing shooting from above. This equipment was used in a scene in which Jaguar Paw leaps off a waterfall.\n\nA number of animals are featured in \"Apocalypto\", including a Baird's tapir and a black jaguar. Animatronics or puppets were employed for the scenes injurious to animals.\n\nThe soundtrack to \"Apocalypto\" was composed by James Horner in his third collaboration with director Mel Gibson. The soundtrack lacks a traditional orchestral score and instead features a large array of exotic instruments and vocals by Pakistani singer Rahat Fateh Ali Khan.\n\nWhile Mel Gibson financed the film through his Icon Productions, Disney signed on to distribute \"Apocalypto\" for a fee in certain markets under the Touchstone Pictures label. The publicity for the film started with a December 2005 teaser trailer that was filmed before the start of principal photography and before Rudy Youngblood was cast as Jaguar Paw. As a joke, Gibson inserted a subliminal cameo of the bearded director in a plaid shirt with a cigarette hanging from his mouth posing next to a group of dust-covered Maya. A clean-shaven Gibson also filmed a Mayan-language segment for the introduction of the 2006 Academy Awards in which he declined to host the ceremony.\nOn September 23, 2006, Gibson pre-screened the unfinished film to two predominantly Native American audiences in the US state of Oklahoma, at the Riverwind Casino in Goldsby, owned by the Chickasaw Nation, and at Cameron University in Lawton. He also did a pre-screening in Austin, Texas, on September 24 in conjunction with one of the film's stars, Rudy Youngblood. In Los Angeles, Gibson screened \"Apocalypto\" and participated in a Q&A session for Latin Business Association and for members of the Maya community. Due to an enthusiastic response from exhibitors, Disney opened the film on more than 2,500 screens in the United States.\n\nAccording to Mel Gibson, the Mayan setting of \"Apocalypto\" is \"merely the backdrop\" for a more universal story of exploring \"civilizations and what undermines them\". The background to the events depicted is the terminal Postclassic period, immediately prior to the arrival of the Spanish, ca. 1511, which the filmmakers researched before writing. \n\nThe corrosive forces of corruption are illustrated in specific scenes throughout the film. Excessive consumption can be seen in the extravagant lifestyle of the upper-class Maya, their vast wealth contrasted with the sickly, the extremely poor, and the enslaved. Environmental degradation is portrayed both in the exploitation of natural resources, such as the over-mining and farming of the land, but also through the treatment of people, families and entire tribes as resources to be harvested and sold into slavery. Political corruption is seen in the leaders' manipulation, the human sacrifice on a large scale, and the slave trade. The film shows slaves being forced to create the lime stucco cement that covered the temples, an act that some historians consider a major factor in the Maya decline. One calculation estimates that it would take five tons of jungle forestry to make one ton of quicklime. Historical consultant Richard D. Hansen explains, \"I found one pyramid in El Mirador that would have required nearly 650 hectares (1,600 acres) of every single available tree just to cover one building with lime stucco... Epic construction was happening... creating devastation on a huge scale.\"\n\nThe filmmakers intended this depiction of the Maya collapse to have relevance for contemporary society. The problems \"faced by the Maya are extraordinarily similar to those faced today by our own civilization,\" co-writer Safinia stated during production, \"especially when it comes to widespread environmental degradation, excessive consumption and political corruption\". Gibson has stated that the film is an attempt at illustrating the parallels between a great fallen empire of the past and the great empires of today, saying \"People think that modern man is so enlightened, but we're susceptible to the same forces – and we are also capable of the same heroism and transcendence.\" The film serves as a cultural critique – in Hansen's words, a \"social statement\" – sending the message that it is never a mistake to question our own assumptions about morality. The main purpose of the movie has a lot to do with a quote from Will Durant at the very beginning of the movie \"A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within\", the fighting between tribes, and the arrival of the Conquerors aboard the ships at the end of the movie.\n\nHowever, Gibson has also stated that he wanted the film to be hopeful rather than entirely negative. Gibson has defined the title as \"a new beginning or an unveiling – a revelation\"; he says \"Everything has a beginning and an end, and all civilizations have operated like that\". The Greek word (, \"apokaluptō\") is in fact a verb meaning \"I uncover\", \"disclose\", or \"reveal\". Gibson has also said a theme of the film is the exploration of primal fears.\n\n\"Apocalypto\" received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 66%, based on 198 reviews, with an average rating of 6.34/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Apocalypto\" is a brilliantly filmed, if mercilessly bloody, examination of a once great civilization.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 68 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nRichard Roeper and guest critic Aisha Tyler on the television show \"Ebert & Roeper\" gave it \"two thumbs up\" rating. Michael Medved gave \"Apocalypto\" four stars (out of four) calling the film \"an adrenaline-drenched chase movie\" and \"a visceral visual experience.\"\n\nThe film was released less than six months after Gibson's 2006 DUI incident, which garnered Gibson much negative publicity and magnified concerns some had over alleged antisemitism in his previous film, \"The Passion of the Christ\". Several key film critics alluded to the incident in their reviews of \"Apocalypto\": In his positive review, \"The New York Times\" A. O. Scott commented: \"say what you will about him – about his problem with booze or his problem with Jews – he is a serious filmmaker.\" The \"Boston Globe\" review came to a similar conclusion, noting that \"Gibson may be a lunatic, but he's our lunatic, and while I wouldn't wish him behind the wheel of a car after happy hour or at a B'nai Brith function anytime, behind a camera is another matter.\" In a negative review, Salon.com noted \"People are curious about this movie because of what might be called extra-textual reasons, because its director is an erratic and charismatic Hollywood figure who would have totally marginalized himself by now if he didn't possess a crude gift for crafting violent pop entertainment.\"\n\n\"Apocalypto\" gained some passionate champions in the Hollywood community. Actor Robert Duvall called it \"maybe the best movie I've seen in 25 years\". Director Quentin Tarantino said, \"I think it's a masterpiece. It was perhaps the best film of that year. I think it was the best artistic film of that year.\" Martin Scorsese, writing about the film, called it \"a vision,\" adding, \"Many pictures today don't go into troubling areas like this, the importance of violence in the perpetuation of what's known as civilization. I admire \"Apocalypto\" for its frankness, but also for the power and artistry of the filmmaking.\" Actor Edward James Olmos said, \"I was totally caught off guard. It's arguably the best movie I've seen in years. I was blown away.\" In 2013, director Spike Lee put the film on his list of all-time essential films.\n\nOn release in Mexico the film registered a wider number of viewers than \"\" and \"Rocky Balboa\". It even displaced memorable Mexican premieres such as \"Titanic\" and \"Poseidon\". According to polls performed by the newspaper \"Reforma\", 80% of polled Mexicans labeled the film as \"very good\" or \"good\".\n\nFor his role as producer and director of the film, Mel Gibson was given the Trustee Award by the First Americans in the Arts organization. Gibson was also awarded the Latino Business Association's Chairman's Visionary Award for his work on \"Apocalypto\" on November 2, 2006, at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles. At the ceremony, Gibson said that the film was a \"badge of honor for the Latino community.\" Gibson also stated that \"Apocalypto\" would help dismiss the notion that \"history only began with Europeans\".\n\n\n\nMany writers felt that Gibson's film was relatively accurate about the Maya, since it depicts the era of decline and division that followed the civilization's peak, collapse, re-settlement, and proto-historic societal conditions. One Mexican reporter, Juan E. Pardinas, wrote that \"this historical interpretation bears some resemblances with reality ... Mel Gibson's characters are more similar to the Mayas of the Bonampak's murals than the ones that appear in the Mexican school textbooks.\" \"The first researchers tried to make a distinction between the 'peaceful' Maya and the 'brutal' cultures of central Mexico\", David Stuart wrote in a 2003 article. \"They even tried to say human sacrifice was rare among the Maya.\" But in carvings and mural paintings, Stuart said: \"we have now found more and greater similarities between the Aztecs and Mayas.\"\n\nRichard D. Hansen, who was a historical consultant on the film, stated that the effect the film will have on Maya archaeology will be beneficial:\n\"It is a wonderful opportunity to focus world attention on the ancient Maya and to realize the role they played in world history.\" However, in an interview with \"The Washington Post\", Hansen stated the film \"give[s] the feeling they're a sadistic lot\", and said, \"I'm a little apprehensive about how the contemporary Maya will take it.\"\n\nSome observers were more cautious. William Booth of \"The Washington Post\" wrote that the film depicts the Maya as a \"super-cruel, psycho-sadistic society on the skids, a ghoulscape engaged in widespread slavery, reckless sewage treatment and bad rave dancing, with a real lust for human blood.\" Gibson compared the savagery in the film to the Bush administration, telling British film magazine \"Hotdog\", \"The fear-mongering we depict in the film reminds me of President Bush and his guys.\" Just prior to its release, \"Apocalypto\" was criticized by activists in Guatemala, including Lucio Yaxon, who charged that the trailer depicts Maya as savages. In her review of the film, anthropologist Traci Ardren wrote that \"Apocalypto\" was biased because \"no mention is made of the achievements in science and art, the profound spirituality and connection to agricultural cycles, or the engineering feats of Maya cities\". This comment is in spite of a scene in the film of a solar eclipse being used by the Maya upper-class in a ruse, which shows very strong astronomical knowledge. \"Apocalypto\" also sparked a strong condemnation from art history professor Julia Guernsey, a Mesoamerican specialist, who said, \"I think it's despicable. It's offensive to Maya people. It's offensive to those of us who try to teach cultural sensitivity and alternative world views that might not match our own 21st century Western ones but are nonetheless valid.\"\n\n\"Apocalypto\" has been criticized for portraying a type of human sacrifice which was more typical of the Aztecs than of the Maya. Archaeologist Lisa Lucero said, \"the classic Maya really didn't go in for mass sacrifice. That was the Aztecs.\" Anthropology professor Karl Taube argued that, \"We know the Aztecs did that level of killing. Their accounts speak of 20,000.\" According to the film's technical advisor, the film was meant to describe the post-classic period of the Maya when fiercer influences like the Toltecs and Aztecs arrived. According to Hansen, \"We know warfare was going on. The Postclassic center of Tulum is a walled city; these sites had to be in defensive positions. There was tremendous Aztec influence by this time. The Aztecs were clearly ruthless in their conquest and pursuit of sacrificial victims, a practice that spilled over into some of the Maya areas.\" Anthropology professor Stephen Houston made the criticism that sacrifice victims were more likely to be royalty and elites rather than common forest dwellers, as shown in \"Apocalypto\". Anthropology professor Karl Taube criticized the film's apparent depiction of widespread slavery, saying, \"We have no evidence of large numbers of slaves.\" Another disputed scene, when Jaguar Paw and the rest of the captives are used as target practice, was acknowledged by the filmmakers to be invented as a plot device for igniting the chase sequence. Some anthropologists objected to the presence of a huge pit filled with rotting corpses near the fields of the Maya. Hansen states that this is \"conjecture\", saying that \"all [Gibson was] trying to do there is express the horror of it\".\n\nThe \"Washington Post\" reported that the famous Bonampak murals were digitally altered to show a warrior holding a dripping human heart, which is not present in the original.\n\nAccording to the DVD commentary track by Mel Gibson and Farhad Safinia, the ending of the film was meant to depict the first contact between the Spaniards and Mayas that took place in 1511 when Pedro De Alvarado arrived on the coast of the Yucatan and Guatemala, and also during the fourth voyage of Christopher Columbus in 1502.\n\nThe thematic meaning of the arrival of the Europeans is a subject of disagreement. Traci Ardren wrote that the Spanish arrivals were Christian missionaries and that the film had a \"blatantly colonial message that the Mayas needed saving because they were 'rotten at the core.'\" According to Ardren, the Gibson film \"replays, in glorious big-budget technicolor, an offensive and racist notion that Maya people were brutal to one another long before the arrival of Europeans and thus they deserved, in fact they needed, rescue. This same idea was used for 500 years to justify the subjugation of Maya people.\" On the other hand, David van Biema questions whether the Spaniards are portrayed as saviors of the Mayas, since they are depicted ominously and Jaguar Paw decides to return to the woods. This view is supported by the reference of the Oracle Girl to those who would \"Scratch out the earth. Scratch you out. And end your world.\" However, recalling the opening quote to the film (\"A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within\"), professors David Stuart and Stephen Houston have written the implication is that Postclassic Mayans had become so corrupt that they were \"a civilization ... that deserves to die.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2308715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308715", "title": "Tiger Inn", "text": "Tiger Inn\n\nThe Tiger Inn (or \"\"T.I.\"\" as it is colloquially known) is one of the eleven active eating clubs at Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey. Tiger Inn was founded in 1890 and is one of the \"Big Four\" eating clubs at Princeton (the others are The Ivy Club, University Cottage Club, and Cap and Gown Club), the four oldest and most prestigious on campus. Tiger Inn is the third oldest Princeton Eating Club. Its historic clubhouse is located at 48 Prospect Avenue, Princeton, New Jersey, near the Princeton University campus. \nMembers of \"\"T.I.\"\" also frequently refer to the club as \"\"The Glorious Tiger Inn.\"\" \n\nThe Tiger Inn clubhouse is the oldest of the Princeton Eating Club houses. It is both architecturally distinct, built in the Tudor style, and historically notable. \"The Clubhouse is designed in the timbered style of the 15th century and modeled especially after an old inn in Chelsea.\". The clubhouse was built in 1895 for an original club membership of 30 undergraduates. The clubhouse has been in continuous use since the facility first opened. The architect for the clubhouse's original plan was G Howard Chamberlain. According to The Tiger Inn's official history, \"Princeton myth [also] credits [the original plans for the clubhouse] to Howard Crosby Butler, Class of 1892 (a [Charter] member of Tiger Inn and Princeton's first Professor of architectural history).\" The clubhouse's central hall was filled with massive antique furniture presented to the club by Mrs. T. Harrison Garrett; these furnishings remain in use to this day. The funding for the original clubhouse, the land, and the club's other furnishings were provided by the club's membership, although all at the time recognized the extraordinary support and contributions of the Garrett family.\n\nRenovations to the clubhouse have continued since it was built in 1895. During 1922–1923 a room was added to the left of the front door and the second floor was remodeled; the second floor alterations were never used for their intended purpose as members quickly converted the new portion of the second floor space to a card room. In the fall of 1926 the clubhouse was substantially improved; during the six weeks of these alterations club members were required to take their meals at the surrounding clubs. By 1928 the kitchen had been moved to the south of the building. The changes to the clubhouse from 1926 to 1928 were well timed as this coincided with an expansion of the membership. The financing of the renovations placed Tiger Inn on the firm financial footing it would need to survive the Great Depression.\n\nThe distinctive clubhouse has recently undergone renovations, improvements and enlargements as part of its \"“21st Century Expansion and Renovation Project,”\" for which the commissioned architect was Connolly Architecture, Inc. The project was completed with the formal dedication of the new club facilities on the weekend of 11-11-11. Funded entirely by the club's alumni, the expanded facilities include a new dining hall and improvements to the spaces normally reserved for social events. The new facilities provide a more suitable building to serve the club's Active Membership, now up from 26 to over 150 in any given year, and club alumni exceeding 2000 in 2012. Fundraising for the completed project continues.\n\nTiger Inn is a selective club, meaning membership is awarded after successful completion of a process called bicker. During bicker, prospective members interact with current members who then convene to vote on whether the prospective members should \"receive a bid,\" or be invited to join the club.\n\nThe club has designated its 26 original founding members as \"Charter Members:\" at the time of the club's founding, these members were known within the Princeton University community as \"The Sour Balls.\" The Active Membership is that portion of membership that uses the clubhouse on a daily basis and is composed principally of Princeton undergraduates, although graduate students have also been active members from time to time. Alumni Members frequently return to the Tiger Inn. The club also has two honorific categories of membership to recognize and honor those who have had a positive and notable association with the club, whether as members of the Princeton University community or as individuals whose principal affiliation with the Princeton community is their association with the Tiger Inn.\n\nTiger Inn's membership was once described by F. Scott Fitzgerald in \"This Side of Paradise\" (1920) as \"broad-shouldered and athletic, vitalized by an honest elaboration of prep-school standards.\" In a 1927 essay on Princeton for the magazine \"College Humor\", Fitzgerald elaborated: \"Tiger Inn cultivates a bluff simplicity. Its membership is largely athletic and while it pretends to disdain social qualifications it has a sharp exclusiveness of its own.\"\n\nFitzgerald's comments were written during his time at Princeton University, when the membership of each of the Eating Clubs was male only. Women were not accepted as undergraduates at Princeton until 1969. Debate over co-ed Eating Club membership abounded from 1969 until 1991. In 1979, undergraduate Sally Frank filed suit against then all-male clubs Ivy Club, Cottage Club, and Tiger Inn for gender discrimination. While Cottage chose to coeducate during the intervening years, Ivy Club and Tiger Inn were forced to become co-ed organizations in 1991, after their appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court regarding Frank's lawsuit was denied. The New Jersey Supreme Court had ruled in \"Frank v. Ivy Club\" that the failure to open membership to women violated the state's anti-discrimination statute. \n\nIn modern times, the membership of The Tiger Inn is distinctly coed, and the club's membership and leadership, including members of both its Graduate Council and the undergraduate officers have included many notable Princeton alumnae and female students, respectively. In 2015 Grace Larsen was elected as the club's first female president. That same year Maria Yu was elected as treasurer, and Victoria Hammarskjold was elected as communication chair, thus making it the first time the club's undergraduate officers were gender-balanced, with three women and three men.\n\nThe full membership of the club, including all living alumni, have met four times to commemorate anniversaries of Tiger Inn. The highlight of the club's fiftieth anniversary celebration was the publication of the club's first official history, written by Charlie Mulduar and released in March 1940, just before America's involvement in World War II. The club's seventy-fifth anniversary was held on December 9, 1965, at the Hotel Roosevelt in New York. The celebrations for the 100th anniversary of the Club began in 1988 with a small informal meeting of 40 alumni at the Princeton Club of New York who began to plan the Centennial celebrations. The Centennial Celebrations peaked with the Club's Hundredth Anniversary Dinner held on October 20, 1990, at the Hyatt in Princeton, following which many of the alumni insisted on continuing celebrations at the clubhouse. The Centennial celebrations were concluded by the subsequent publication of the second club history entitled \"The Tiger Inn of Princeton, New Jersey, 1890–1997\". In February, 2016 The Tiger Inn marked its 125th Anniversary with a Dinner held at the Westin in Princeton, followed by continued celebrations at the clubhouse.\n\nTiger Inn members acted to form the first American Olympics team for the first modern Olympic games in Athens in 1896. Most of the first American Olympic team came from Princeton, Harvard University and the Boston Athletic Association. Four Princetonians, including three Tiger Inn members, participated in those games. The TI members earned six medals in total: two gold, three silver medals, and one bronze; the four Princetonians earned 7 medals in total. The three TI members were Robert Garrett, Herb Jamison and Frank Lane; they were joined by Princetonian Al Tyler, who also medalled. These four Princeton athletes' 7 medals helped the 1896 American Olympic team earn 20 medals in total. Team Member Garrett delivered the most unexpected upset of the 1896 Games when he won Gold in the Discus, outperforming his Greek rival to win the most symbolic sport carried over from the ancient Olympics to the modern Olympic games.\n\nTI members continued to participate in the Olympics after the 1896 Athens games. Garrett returned to the Olympics for the 1900 Paris games where he won two bronze medals. He was joined in the Paris games by John Cregan who won a silver medal in the 800 meters. John DeWitt competed in the 1904 St. Louis games; he was joined there by A. M. Woods, who earned a silver medal. \nPete Raymond rowed in both the 1968 Mexico City and 1972 Munich games; he earned a silver medal in Munich.\n\nTiger Inn members have earned more than 11 Olympic medals. Garrett's lifetime record of 6 Olympic medals among Princeton athletes continues to stand.\n\nTiger Inn members have been both Princeton football players, and professional football players. The College Football Hall of Fame lists many TI members in its ranks.\n\nTiger Inn alumni have returned to Princeton to serve as Head Coaches of Princeton's football program. As college football head coaches, Tiger Inn alumni through the class of 1900 compiled composite career coaching records of 175-31-5. They coached Princeton to at least one national championship. TI members who served as Princeton Football Head Coach include Garrett Cochran, Arthur Hillebrand and Robert Casciola. TI Members have also served as Head Coaches of Football at Annapolis, Berkeley, Bowdoin, Georgetown, and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, among other colleges.\n\nCharlie Gogolak and Cosmo Iacavazzi are two prominent TI members who became professional football players.\n\nThrough the club's history Tiger Inn members have also featured prominently in other collegiate sports in which Princeton competes.\n\nIn 2012 the Princeton men's squash team won the National Collegiate Championship powered by the performances of three Tiger Inn members.\n\nTiger Inn's sole winner of a Nobel Prize, thus far, is economist Michael Spence, the winner of the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics together with George Akerlof (a Lawrenceville graduate) and Joseph Stiglitz. During his illustrious career Spence has served as Dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Business and is presently Chairman of the \"Commission for Growth and Development\".\n\nPrinceton University's School of Architecture was founded in 1919 through the efforts of Tiger Inn Charter Member Howard Clark Butler and his fellow faculty members. He became the School of Architecture's Director in 1920. Professor Butler was only the second Princeton Professor to offer a course related to architecture, following the precedent set by Princeton Professor Marquand.\n\nIn addition to Spence, Tiger Inn has produced well over 100 members of \"Phi Beta Kappa.\" Its members have earned at least three Rhodes, and two Marshall, Scholarships. TI members serve as research scientists at the Bell Labs and NASA and in the research or \"Think Tank\" roles of such commercial organizations as international financial institutions and the BIG 4 accounting firms, among other organizations.\n\nTiger Inn alumni have served many universities, including Princeton, as faculty members and as non-faculty instructors and administrators. Spence has served Harvard University, New York University and Stanford University. Butler served Princeton as did noted philologist W K. Prentice. Chauncey Loomis was a Dartmouth professor, and from there, led 5 Arctic expeditions. James Harland was a professor of classics at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. John Fine joined the Princeton faculty in 1940 from Yale as a professor of Classics and retired in 1972. Richard H Williams is a professor of History at Southern Methodist University.

{"id": "2308722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308722", "title": "Risk perception", "text": "Risk perception\n\nRisk perception is the subjective judgement that people make about the characteristics and severity of a risk. The phrase is most commonly used in reference to natural hazards and threats to the environment or health, such as nuclear power. Several theories have been proposed to explain why different people make different estimates of the dangerousness of risks. Three major families of theory have been developed: psychology approaches (heuristics and cognitive), anthropology/sociology approaches (cultural theory) and interdisciplinary approaches (social amplification of risk framework).\n\nThe study of risk perception arose out of the observation that experts and lay people often disagreed about how risky various technologies and natural hazards were.\n\nThe mid 1960s saw the rapid rise of nuclear technologies and the promise of clean and safe energy. However, public perception shifted against this new technology. Fears of both longitudinal dangers to the environment and immediate disasters creating radioactive wastelands turned the public against this new technology. The scientific and governmental communities asked why public perception was against the use of nuclear energy when all the scientific experts were declaring how safe it really was. The problem, as experts perceived it, was a difference between scientific facts and an exaggerated public perception of the dangers.\n\nA key early paper was written in 1969 by Chauncey Starr. Starr used a revealed preference approach to find out what risks are considered acceptable by society. He assumed that society had reached equilibrium in its judgment of risks, so whatever risk levels actually existed in society were acceptable. His major finding was that people will accept risks 1,000 times greater if they are voluntary (e.g. driving a car) than if they are involuntary (e.g. a nuclear disaster).\n\nThis early approach assumed that individuals behave rationally by weighing information before making a decision, and that individuals have exaggerated fears due to inadequate or incorrect information. Implied in this assumption is that additional information can help people understand true risk and hence lessen their opinion of danger. While researchers in the engineering school did pioneer research in risk perception, by adapting theories from economics, it has little use in a practical setting. Numerous studies have rejected the belief that additional information alone will shift perceptions.\n\nThe psychological approach began with research in trying to understand how people process information. These early works maintained that people use cognitive heuristics in sorting and simplifying information, leading to biases in comprehension. Later work built on this foundation and became the \"psychometric paradigm\". This approach identifies numerous factors responsible for influencing individual perceptions of risk, including dread, novelty, stigma, and other factors.\n\nResearch also shows that risk perceptions are influenced by the emotional state of the perceiver. The valence theory of risk perception only differentiates between positive emotions, such as happiness and optimism, and negative ones, such as fear and anger. According to valence theory, positive emotions lead to optimistic risk perceptions whereas negative emotions influence a more pessimistic view of risk.\n\nResearch also has found that, whereas risk and benefit tend to be positively correlated across hazardous activities in the world, they are negatively correlated in people's minds and judgements.\n\nThe earliest psychometric research was done by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, who performed a series of gambling experiments to see how people evaluated probabilities. Their major finding was that people use a number of heuristics to evaluate information. These heuristics are usually useful shortcuts for thinking, but they may lead to inaccurate judgments in some situations – in which case they become cognitive biases.\n\nAnother key finding was that the experts are not necessarily any better at estimating probabilities than lay people. Experts were often overconfident in the exactness of their estimates, and put too much stock in small samples of data.\n\nThe majority of people in the public express a greater concern for problems which appear to possess an immediate effect on everyday life such as hazardous waste or pesticide-use than for long-term problems that may affect future generations such as climate change or population growth. People greatly rely on the scientific community to assess the threat of environmental problems because they usually do not directly experience the effects of phenomena such as climate change. The exposure most people have to climate change has been impersonal; most people only have virtual experience through documentaries and news media in what may seem like a “remote” area of the world. However, coupled with the population’s wait-and-see attitude, people do not understand the importance of changing environmentally destructive behaviors even when experts provide detailed and clear risks caused by climate change.\n\nResearch within the psychometric paradigm turned to focus on the roles of affect, emotion, and stigma in influencing risk perception. Melissa Finucane and Paul Slovic have been among the key researchers here. These researchers first challenged Starr's article by examining expressed preference – how much risk people say they are willing to accept. They found that, contrary to Starr's basic assumption, people generally saw most risks in society as being unacceptably high. They also found that the gap between voluntary and involuntary risks was not nearly as great as Starr claimed.\n\nSlovic and team found that perceived risk is quantifiable and predictable. People tend to view current risk levels as unacceptably high for most activities. All things being equal, the greater people perceived a benefit, the greater the tolerance for a risk. If a person derived pleasure from using a product, people tended to judge its benefits as high and its risks as low. If the activity was disliked, the judgments were opposite. Research in psychometrics has proven that risk perception is highly dependent on intuition, experiential thinking, and emotions.\n\nPsychometric research identified a broad domain of characteristics that may be condensed into three high order factors: 1) the degree to which a risk is understood, 2) the degree to which it evokes a feeling of dread, and 3) the number of people exposed to the risk. A dread risk elicits visceral feelings of terror, uncontrollable, catastrophe, inequality, and uncontrolled. An unknown risk is new and unknown to science. The more a person dreads an activity, the higher its perceived risk and the more that person wants the risk reduced.\n\nThe anthropology/sociology approach posits risk perceptions as produced by and supporting social institutions. In this view, perceptions are socially constructed by institutions, cultural values, and ways of life.\n\nOne line of the Cultural Theory of risk is based on the work of anthropologist Mary Douglas and political scientist Aaron Wildavsky first published in 1982. In cultural theory, Douglas and Wildavsky outline four “ways of life” in a grid/group arrangement. Each way of life corresponds to a specific social structure and a particular outlook on risk. Grid categorizes the degree to which people are constrained and circumscribed in their social role. The tighter binding of social constraints limits individual negotiation. Group refers to the extent to which individuals are bounded by feelings of belonging or solidarity. The greater the bonds, the less individual choice are subject to personal control. Four ways of life include: Hierarchical, Individualist, Egalitarian, and Fatalist.\n\nRisk perception researchers have not widely accepted this version of cultural theory. Even Douglas says that the theory is controversial; it poses a danger of moving out of the favored paradigm of individual rational choice of which many researchers are comfortable.\n\nOn the other hand, writers who drawn upon a broader cultural theory perspective have argued that risk-perception analysis helps understand the public response to terrorism in a way that goes far beyond 'rational choice'. As John Handmer and Paul James write:\n\nThe First National Culture and Risk Survey of cultural cognition found that a person's worldview on the two social and cultural dimensions of \"hierarchy-egalitarianism,\" and \"individualism-solidarism\" was predictive of their response to risk.\n\nThe Social Amplification of Risk Framework (SARF), combines research in psychology, sociology, anthropology, and communications theory. SARF outlines how communications of risk events pass from the sender through intermediate stations to a receiver and in the process serve to amplify or attenuate perceptions of risk. All links in the communication chain, individuals, groups, media, etc., contain filters through which information is sorted and understood.\n\nThe framework attempts to explain the process by which risks are amplified, receiving public attention, or attenuated, receiving less public attention. The framework may be used to compare responses from different groups in a single event, or analyze the same risk issue in multiple events. In a single risk event, some groups may amplify their perception of risks while other groups may attenuate, or decrease, their perceptions of risk.\n\nThe main thesis of SARF states that risk events interact with individual psychological, social and other cultural factors in ways that either increase or decrease public perceptions of risk. Behaviors of individuals and groups then generate secondary social or economic impacts while also increasing or decreasing the physical risk itself.\n\nThese ripple effects caused by the amplification of risk include enduring mental perceptions, impacts on business sales, and change in residential property values, changes in training and education, or social disorder. These secondary changes are perceived and reacted to by individuals and groups resulting in third-order impacts. As each higher-order impacts are reacted to, they may ripple to other parties and locations. Traditional risk analyses neglect these ripple effect impacts and thus greatly underestimate the adverse effects from certain risk events. Public distortion of risk signals provides a corrective mechanism by which society assesses a fuller determination of the risk and its impacts to such things not traditionally factored into a risk analysis.\n\n\n\n"}

Guiche piercings are much more common in men than in women. Although a guiche normally runs perpendicular to the direction of the penis, lateral placements are possible. A series of guiche piercings in parallel to the direction of the penis is called a guiche ladder. \n\nDepending on the anatomy of the individual, a guiche piercing can heal quickly with few complications, like a normal piercing, or it may require specialized initial jewelry and care, like a surface piercing. Due to the proximity to the anus, good hygiene is important both during the initial healing period, and on an ongoing basis after the piercing is healed. The estimated healing time for a guiche piercing is between 6 and 9 months. Sitting-related activities that place stress on the region may cause irritation to the site leading to the migration or rejection of the piercing.\n\nBoth captive bead rings and barbell-style jewelry are worn in guiche piercings, both as initial jewelry as well as after the piercing has healed. Guiche piercings can be stretched to large sizes and can accommodate flesh tunnel style jewelry, although the potential discomfort to the bearer may be radically increased. Guiche weights may be attached to the piercing, causing added sexual stimulation.\n\nRichard Simonton, also known by his pseudonym Doug Malloy, authored a pamphlet entitled \"Body & Genital Piercing in Brief\" which created much of the contemporary mythology surrounding the origin of various body piercings, including the guiche. In the pamphlet guiche piercing is described as originating in the South Pacific, most specifically Tahiti. Simonton's perspectives were coloured by his own enthusiasm for genital piercing as an erotic practice, and his materials are not considered to be accurate. Like many genital piercings, guiche piercings were primarily practiced in gay BDSM culture, prior to the resurgence of piercing in Western Culture in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nIt is sometimes used by couples for advanced power-play, being chained and/or locked to a prince albert piercing for the purpose of male genital infibulation and long term physical control (and the corresponding potent psychological control) over the submissive male through the practice of enforced chastity. In the most extreme cases, both rings are cemented, glued, or even soldered shut for a semi-permanent (removable only within a surgical setting) alternative to a chastity device to be worn over months or years at a time.\n\n\n"}

She is the daughter of Australian statistician Geoffrey Watson and the granddaughter of British constitutional law scholar Sir William Ivor Jennings. Caine currently resides in London.\n\nCaine’s career has been divided between opera and musical theatre. She made her West End debut at the age of 19 in the role of Laurey in \"Oklahoma!\". She then sang the role of Eliza in \"My Fair Lady\" on a national tour. While making her debut at Glyndebourne as Amor in \"L'incoronazione di Poppea\", she was asked to join the Royal Shakespeare Company where she created the role of Cosette in \"Les Misérables\".\n\nAfter a successful West End run, she joined the original cast of \"Phantom of the Opera\" to play Christine opposite Michael Crawford as alternate (performing 2 shows a week) when original Christine Sarah Brightman left the show and was replaced by the original alternate, Claire Moore.\n\nWhen the rights to a Canadian production of \"Phantom\" were secured, producer Garth Drabinsky aggressively pursued Caine to reprise the role in Toronto. Andrew Lloyd Webber, who greatly admired Caine's portrayal of Christine in the London production, also strongly suggested she take the role. At the time, Caine was very close to signing a contract to star in another West End show. Ultimately, she chose Phantom and relocated to Toronto and also spent time in New York in early 1989 for principal cast rehearsals with director Hal Prince.\n\nThe Canadian production of \"The Phantom of the Opera\" premiered on September 20, 1989, at the restored Pantages Theatre, with Susan Cuthbert playing Christine two performances per week as Caine's alternate. The show broke then box office records for advance ticket sales, and ran for just over ten years. During her run in Toronto, she joined the Canadian Opera Company to make her North American operatic debut in the title role of Alban Berg's \"Lulu\". This led to offers from numerous international opera companies ranging from Claudio Monteverdi to Peter Maxwell Davies, including Pamina, Despina, Susanna, Aminta (\"Il re pastore\"), Vixen, Michaela, Musetta, Ophelie, Leila, Marguerite, Violetta, \"Julietta\" (Bohuslav Martinů) and Adina for companies such as the Canadian Opera Company, Scottish Opera, English National Opera, Glimmerglass Opera, Spoleto Festival, Opéra de Nice, Vlaamse Opera, New Zealand Opera, National Theatre of Prague, and Opera North. In 2006 she performed as Hanna Glawari in Franz Lehár's \"The Merry Widow\" for Opera Holland Park in London in 2006.\n\nIn 1996, Caine made a guest appearance on The Future Sound of London's album \"Dead Cities\", performing operatic vocals on the song \"Everyone in the World Is Doing Something Without Me\".\n\nOn October 7, 2006, Caine reunited with her former cast colleagues from the original London production of \"Les Misérables\" to sing \"One Day More\" after a performance in celebration of the show's 21st anniversary making it the longest running musical in the world. The original cast reunited again in 2010 to celebrate the show's 25th anniversary at the O2 Arena in London.\n\nIn May 2009, Caine made her Chicago debut in the Chicago Opera Theater's production of Benjamin Britten's \"Owen Wingrave\".\n\nIn December 2010, Caine returned to the musical theatre stage as Lady Raeburn in \"Salad Days\" produced by Tête à Tête.\n\nIn May 2011, Caine played Ottavia in a jazz adaptation of \"The Coronation of Poppea\" directed by Mark Ravenhill.\n\nIn the summer of 2012, Caine played Baroness Elsa Schraeder in the \"Sound of Music\" at the Kilworth House Theatre in Leicestershire. The production also featured Helena Blackman as Maria and Jan Hartley as Mother Abbess.\n\nIn March 2013, Caine played Lady Vale in \"Darling of the Day\" at the Union Theatre, London. Due to suffering from laryngitis on press night another actor had to sing-in for her, but she recovered to complete the rest of the run.\n\nFrom 27 November 2014 to 3 January 2015, Caine played Katisha in \"The Mikado\" at London's Charing Cross Theatre.\nIn December 2015-February 2016, Caine joined the Asolo Repertory Theatre Company in Sarasota, Florida making her straight\nacting debut as Raquel De Angellis in 'Living On Love'.\n\nCaine continues to perform concerts and solo cabaret performances throughout Britain and North America, in addition to her work with opera and theatre companies.
