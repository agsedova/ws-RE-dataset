{"id": "1948542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1948542", "title": "Springwatch", "text": "Springwatch\n\nSpringwatch, Autumnwatch and Winterwatch are annual BBC television series which chart the fortunes of British wildlife during the changing of the seasons in the United Kingdom. The programmes are broadcast live from locations around the country in a primetime evening slot on BBC Two. They require a crew of 100 and over 50 cameras, making them the BBC's largest British outside broadcast events. Many of the cameras are hidden and operated remotely to record natural behaviour, for example, of birds in their nests and badgers outside their sett.\n\n\"Springwatch\" begins on the Spring Bank Holiday and is broadcast four nights each week for three weeks. After the success of the first \"Springwatch\" in 2005, the BBC commissioned a one-off special, \"Autumnwatch\", which became a full series in 2006. \"Winterwatch\" began in 2012, broadcast in January or February.\n\nThe \"Springwatch\" brand has expanded to incorporate further TV spin-offs and specials, and also has a strong online presence. The BBC \"Springwatch\" website offers further video content and allows viewers and programme makers to interact through a message board, Flickr photography group, blogs and the @BBCSpringwatch and @BBCAutumnwatch Twitter accounts. The executive producer of the three programme strands is Rosemary Edwards (before 2018: Tim Scoones) and the score was composed by David Poore. Programmes are made by the BBC Natural History Unit, but were originally commissioned by BBC Learning with the aim of getting viewers to actively participate in wildlife conservation.\n\nBill Oddie, Kate Humble and Simon King were the presenting team until 2008. Oddie departed as a regular host at the beginning of 2009 (though not by his own choice), to be replaced by Chris Packham. Martin Hughes-Games, formerly a \"Springwatch\" producer, also joined the team in 2009. In September 2010, King left the presenting team to pursue other projects. Michaela Strachan filled in for Humble during \"Autumnwatch 2011\", reuniting her with Packham, her former co-host on \"The Really Wild Show\". When Humble left after \"Springwatch 2012\", Strachan became her permanent replacement. Gillian Burke became a regular presenter in 2017,and for \"Winterwatch 2019\" the presenters were joined by Iolo Williams, who had previously been a field reporter.\n\nOther regular contributors include cameraman and presenter Gordon Buchanan and sound recordist Chris Watson, who has occasionally appeared on-screen to describe his working methods.\n\nNatural history programmes began as live outside broadcasts on BBC television in the early 1950s, when West Region's only television equipment was a mobile camera unit. The origins of \"Springwatch\" can be traced back to the 1970s, when the development of image-intensifying cameras enabled animals to be filmed in the dark. In May 1977, two remote-controlled cameras and a series of infrared lamps were installed outside a badger sett in the Cotswolds. The Natural History Unit broadcast the first live images of wild badgers during a week-long television event called \"Badgerwatch\". Although each programme was only 10 minutes long, it created the template on which \"Springwatch\" and all the intervening series have been based, a format which has developed and expanded as technology has improved.\n\n\"Badgerwatch\" was followed by \"Birdwatch\", broadcast annually throughout the 1980s and presented by Tony Soper, initially from locations around Britain including Slimbridge, Minsmere, the River Exe, the Farne Islands and Martin Mere. Later series were filmed in Florida, the Netherlands and the Camargue.\n\nIn 1988 came \"Reefwatch\", the first ever live underwater broadcast shown on British and American television. It was anchored by Soper, with divers Martha Holmes and Mike deGruy presenting during the Red Sea dive using bubble helmets (another TV first). The BBC broadcast further live series from Africa with \"Africawatch\" (1989) and \"Flamingowatch\" (1995).\n\nBill Oddie and Simon King joined forces for the first time to present \"A Bird in the Nest\" in 1994, featuring 5 live instalments from nestbox cameras. King also co-presented \"Beachwatch\", a day of live broadcasts from a stretch of Norfolk coastline, which aimed to show how wildlife responded to the changing tide.\n\nThe live format was rested until 2003, when it was resurrected with Oddie, King and Kate Humble for \"Wild In Your Garden\". The following year, the show evolved into \"Britain Goes Wild with Bill Oddie\", and was identical to the later \"Springwatch\" and \"Autumnwatch\" series in all but name.\n\nFrom 2005 until 2007, the BBC ran a \"Springwatch\" survey in conjunction with the Woodland Trust. Viewers were encouraged to record key events indicating the passage of spring, including the first sign of frogspawn, blossom on hawthorn trees and the arrival of swifts. By comparing the results with previous years, the surveys established that spring was arriving sooner than average. The BBC are no longer involved in the annual survey (now called Nature's Calendar) but the results are still reported on the programme. It remains the largest survey of phenology in the world.\n\nA similar survey exists for \"Autumnwatch\", with the timing of the first oak leaf tint, the ripening of blackberries and the dropping of conkers all being recorded.\n\nThe BBC-led \"Breathing Places\" campaign was launched during \"Springwatch\" 2006. Awards are made to small projects across the country which aim to create small areas of wildlife-friendly habitat, particularly in cities. In the first three phases of the campaign, over £8.5 million of National Lottery funding has been awarded. Local councils and Wildlife Trusts are also involved in the partnership. \"Breathing Places\" evolved from an earlier BBC campaign called \"Make Space for Nature\", launched in 2004 to coincide with \"Britain Goes Wild with Bill Oddie\".\n\nThe first series of \"Springwatch\" debuted on BBC Two on 30 May 2005, and finished on 16 June. Bill Oddie and Kate Humble were based at Fishleigh Estate, an organic farm in north-west Devon (the same location had been used for the previous year's \"Britain Goes Wild with Bill Oddie\"). Animals filmed included swallows nesting in the barn, blue tit families in nestboxes and great spotted woodpeckers visiting bird feeders. Simon King visited three locations across the country; firstly, the Isle of Mull to watch white-tailed eagles on a nest; secondly, the London Wetland Centre to observe peregrine falcons and red foxes; and finally, the Farne Islands to view the seabird colonies and grey seals. Over 150,000 sightings were reported in the \"Springwatch\" survey.\n\nThe second series of \"Springwatch\" was broadcast from 29 May to 15 June 2006. Bill Oddie and Kate Humble again presented from the Fishleigh Estate farm, where more than 50 secret cameras were rigged up to film the day-to-day dramas of nesting birds including pied flycatchers, barn owls and dabchicks. The badgers only made a single live appearance in the whole three weeks. Pre-recorded films featured moles, capercaillies and earwigs. In the Shetland Islands, Simon King followed a family of otters and a host of birds: puffins, great skuas, oystercatchers, merlins and red-throated divers. \"Springwatch\" also tracked brent geese on their spring migration from Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland to their breeding grounds in Canada's Queen Elizabeth Islands, via stopovers in Iceland and Greenland.\n\nLive webcams around the country enabled viewers to follow animal stories on the \"Springwatch\" website. These included ospreys at Loch Garten in Scotland, red kites at Rockingham Forest in the East Midlands and pipistrelle bats in Cornwall. A spin-off programme titled \"CBeebies Springwatch\" aired on the CBeebies channel and \"Springwatch\" editions of \"The Really Wild Show\" aired on the CBBC channel. The presenters were Justin Fletcher, Nick Baker and Michaela Strachan.\n\nFor the third series of \"Springwatch\", broadcast from 28 May to 14 June 2007 on BBC Two, Bill Oddie and Kate Humble were again based at the Devon farm. Birds filmed live on their nests included swallows, buzzards, jays, barn owls and jackdaws. Oddie had close encounters with an otter and a kingfisher on the River Torridge, which runs through the farm. Simon King travelled to the Hebridean island of Islay, where he filmed local specialities such as red-billed choughs, corncrakes, hen harriers, golden eagles and common shelducks. The series also featured barn owl chicks at Cornwall's Lost Gardens of Heligan, and cameras captured the moment when one chick killed and ate its younger sibling. Gordon Buchanan filmed urban red foxes in Glasgow for a pre-recorded nightly diary segment.\n\nThe 2007 series spawned more spin-offs on other BBC television channels, radio stations and the internet. \"Springwatch Nightshift\" broadcast two hours of live footage of badgers, owls and bats on BBC Two each night, and a half-hour weekly review programme aired on Friday evenings on BBC One. \"CBeebies Springwatch\" returned to CBeebies for 2007 alongside \"Springwatch Trackers\", which aired on CBBC, presented live from the farm each morning by Steve Backshall and Kirsten O'Brien.\n\nA live outside broadcast from the \"Springwatch\" farm featured on Terry Wogan's BBC Radio 2 breakfast show on 13 June, and on BBC Radio 4, a special edition of \"Nature\" on 11 June answered listeners' questions about spring.\n\nFor the fourth series of \"Springwatch\", the production team moved to a new location at the Pensthorpe Natural Park in Norfolk due to a change of ownership at the Fishleigh Estate farm. It was broadcast on BBC Two from 26 May to 12 June. Bill Oddie and Kate Humble watched local birds on the nest, including little ringed plovers, goldcrests and reed buntings, all new species for \"Springwatch\". Swallows, blue tits, great tits, greenfinches, pied wagtails and robins were amongst the returning species. Simon King was based in the Cairngorm National Park, where he brought viewers footage of ospreys with chicks, pine martens, Scottish wildcats, ptarmigan and crested tits. The 2007 edition of \"CBeebies Springwatch\" was repeated that year and would be the final year the series would air, being scrapped in favour of \"Green Balloon Club\".\n\nThe week after the main series ended, four \"Springwatch Specials\" were screened. Humble presented a programme on marine life, Oddie looked at garden wildlife, King focussed on spectacular British wildlife events and Gordon Buchanan met people who have interesting relationships with wildlife.\n\n\"Springwatch\" returned for its fifth series, broadcast from 25 May to 11 June 2009. Bill Oddie, who had left the programme for personal health reasons, was replaced as the series' co-anchor by Chris Packham. He joined Kate Humble for the show's second year based at Pensthorpe. Simon King toured locations across north and mid-Wales, viewing Anglesey's seabird colonies, goshawks and red kites. His main challenge was to find and film a wild polecat. Wildlife cameraman Gordon Buchanan was based at a badger sett in Essex. Former producer Martin Hughes-Games also joined the team to present a regular feature on conservation holidays, as well as co-hosting the spin-off \"Springwatch Unsprung\" programmes. The \"Springwatch\" website continued to host regularly updated blogs, message boards and webcams, as well as wildlife information. Over the course of the series, Packham privately set himself the challenge of inserting the titles of songs by The Smiths into the script for each episode.\n\nThree new \"Springwatch Specials\" aired after the main series had finished; King revealed some of the \"tricks of the trade\" of a wildlife cameraman in \"Close Encounters\"; Hughes-Games revealed Britain's best wildlife locations in \"Holidays\"; and Buchanan presented a compilation of viewers' videos in \"Home Movies\".\n\nThe BBC commissioned a special \"Snow Watch\" programme to show how wildlife was affected by the coldest winter weather for 35 years. The programme was created in just five days, and was broadcast on 13 January 2010 in place of a scheduled edition of \"Natural World\". The \"Points West\" studio was used for the indoor portion of the show and the normal theme music was replaced for the end credits with the song \"Walk Out to Winter\" by Aztec Camera.\n\nThe sixth, three-week, 2010 edition of \"Springwatch\" began airing on BBC Two beginning on 31 May. It was preceded by three special editions, the first of which, Chris Packham's \"Signs of Change\", about climate change, aired on 17 May. Others were shown on 19 and 20 May. The BBC supported the series with a Twitter account, @bbc_springwatch, using the hashtag #springwatch. Packham used a reference to The Cure in each episode. Brett Westwood was among the participants in the series' bird race, and Bill Oddie made a guest appearance in the penultimate episode of the series.\n\nThe series was followed on 20 June by a two-hour, live charity appeal tie-in, \"Wild Night In\". Broadcast from London Zoo, it was fronted by Humble, Packham and Hughes-Games, with pre-recorded segments, some featuring David Attenborough. A 90-minute \"Springwatch Christmas Special\" was broadcast on 29 December. Based at Chris Packham's house in the New Forest, the show included highlights from the 2010 series and specials, plus a number of new reports on topics that had hit the headlines during the year.\n\nA \"Springwatch Easter Special\" was aired on 25 April 2011 and featured the return of Bill Oddie as a guest presenter.\n\nThe full series, presented by Kate Humble, Chris Packham and Martin Hughes-Games, started on Monday 30 May 2011 at 8pm on BBC 2 from a new venue, RSPB Ynys-hir in mid-Wales. During the first week Charlie Hamilton James presented daily updates on the reintroduction of beavers to the United Kingdom. At the end of week one Charlie was set the task of filming beavers live; he succeeded. During week two, Iolo Williams broadcast from Skomer Island. He was filming puffins and during the week introduced a new webcam. The presenter for week three was Liz Bonnin, at Pitsea Landfill site, filming foxes. She was set the task of filming live foxes, and succeeded. The series closed with a montage of clips of the cast \"singing\" the Tom Jones song It's Not Unusual, whose lyrics had been surreptitiously inserted into the script over the three-week run.\n\nA Christmas Special was broadcast on Boxing Day, 26 December, recorded at Ynys-Hir and presented by Strachan, Packham, Hughes-Games and Humble, and featuring guest appearances by Chris Watson and others as well as a newly filmed sequence from Bill Oddie.\n\nSpringwatch returned to BBC Two and BBC HD on 28 May 2012, live and direct from Ynys-hir RSPB reserve in Wales for three weeks, Monday to Thursday. Chris Packham and Martin Hughes-Games will present the show, with Kate Humble being replaced by Autumnwatch Live presenter Michaela Strachan. A summer special was announced on the final episode of Springwatch 2012, and \"Springwatch Guide to Sea Birds\" was broadcast on 23 August 2012.\n\nChris Packham secretly introduced the titles of 49 songs and albums by David Bowie into his presentations.\n\nThe 2013 series of \"Springwatch\" returned on 27 May, and once again was broadcast live for three weeks from RSPB Ynys Hir. Chris Packham, Martin Hughes-Games and Michaela Strachan, returned to present, with Iolo Williams as a roving reporter. A new show called \"Springwatch in the Afternoon\" was broadcast across the first two weeks, hosted by Nick Baker, which was broadcast live on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.\n\n In 2014 \"Springwatch\" celebrated its tenth anniversary by moving to a new base at RSPB Minsmere in North Suffolk. The series was broadcast on BBC Two, online and the Red Button for three weeks from 26 May to 12 June 2014. \"Springwatch Unsprung\", hosted by Baker, was shown after the main programme, online and on the BBC Red Button from Mondays to Wednesdays and on BBC Two on Thursdays. Iolo Williams returned as the regular roving reporter, broadcasting live from the west coast of Scotland. Special features included cameraman Doug Allan's underwater footage of grey seals on Lundy, a report on how the wildlife of the Somerset Levels was affected by the winter floods and updates on the latest research into urban foxes and cuckoo migration.\n\nA special one-off \"Springwatch at Easter\" aired on 3 April 2015. The series returned to RSPB Minsmere on 25 May 2015, with 12 episodes over the next 3 weeks.\n\n\"Springwatch\" aired in 2016 between 30 May and 16 June live from RSPB Minsmere.\n\nThe farmland of Sherborne Park, Gloucestershire became the new host site for \"Springwatch\". The programme gained a new host, Gillian Burke.\n\n\"Springwatch\", again from Sherborne Park, ran for three weeks, starting on Monday 28 May with a 90-minute extended edition. Martin Hughes-Games was not involved, being replaced by a number of guest presenters, the first of which was Steve Backshall. Iolo Williams appeared in week two, with Lucy Cooke and Patrick Aryee scheduled for the final week.\n\n\"Springwatch\" was broadcast from a new site near Nethy Bridge on the edge of the Abernethy Forest in the Cairngorms National Park. Packham, Strachan and Burke continued as presenters and were joined by Iolo Williams.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 series, starting on 25 May, did not come from a central base. Instead each presenter appeared from a location near their home, respecting government guidelines on social distancing. Packham - joined occasionally by his step-daughter Megan McCubbin, a zoologist - was in the New Forest, Williams in mid Wales, and Burke in Cornwall. Although she sent a video message from her home in South Africa, Strachan was unable to return to the UK to participate. Steve Backshall was guest presenter during the first week, from his home on the Thames. Some films from previous years were re-screened. Additional material was made available on the BBC's iPlayer service.\n\nThe first Thursday episode started - at 8pm - with the presenters joining the national \"Clap for Our Carers\", except for Burke, due to her proximity to wild beavers.\n\nEllie Harrison and Gordon Buchanan are scheduled as guest presenters in weeks two and three.\n\nThe success of the first series of \"Springwatch\" led to the BBC and the Woodland Trust collaborating once again to launch an appeal for sightings of the approach of autumn. The results of the first \"Autumnwatch\" survey were presented by Bill Oddie in a one-off programme in November 2005 entitled \"Wild Autumn with Bill Oddie\".\n\nFor 2006, \"Autumnwatch\" was extended to a two-week series, broadcast from 2–12 October. Oddie and Kate Humble were based at Martin Mere wetland reserve in Lancashire, where they awaited the arrival of local wild swans and the return of the brent geese to Northern Island. King watched the red deer rut on the island of Rùm. In addition, cameraman Gordon Buchanan filmed a nightly grey seal diary from the Monarch Islands. British viewers could submit their sightings of natural autumn events on the \"Autumnwatch\" website, and the findings were developed into an online map showing the progression of autumn events across the country. This showed a correlation with temperature. Much like with \"Springwatch\", a spin-off show for CBeebies aired, titled \"CBeebies Autumnwatch\".\n\n\"Autumnwatch\" was broadcast later in the year than the previous series, from 5 to 14 November. Oddie and Humble were based at Martin Mere as for the previous year, but this time King toured some of Britain's best places for viewing wildlife. There were daily pre-recorded sequences from the deer rut in Rum which had taken place earlier in the season. Instead of airing a new series, the 2006 \"CBeebies Autumnwatch\" season was repeated, which caused some parents to complain to the BBC.\n\nFor \"Autumnwatch\" 2008, broadcast from 27 October – 6 November, Oddie and Humble were based at Brownsea Island, one of the few places in southern England where red squirrels can still be seen. King visited a variety of locations around the country, beginning with three days watching fallow deer at Petworth Park and muntjac at Birmingham Airport. He then followed up sightings of otters in a Walsall canal, but although his team found traces of the animals, they didn't manage to film them. During the second week he watched ravens on Anglesey and made two live dives off the south coast of England, managing to find and film a conger eel. Gordon Buchanan travelled to the Farne Islands to film the grey seal colony during the pupping season. Attempts to communicate with Oddie and Humble via a live satellite link, were thwarted on several occasions by bad weather conditions.\n\nAdditional content was made available on the \"Autumnwatch\" website, including live webcams, extra videos and a blog.\n\nIn a change from the usual format, the 2009 series of \"Autumnwatch\" was broadcast once a week every Friday for eight weeks. Executive producer Tim Scoones attributed the change to the popularity of the series' multiplatform formats, such as its Flickr group. The series ran from 2 October to 20 November 2009. Packham and Humble were based at the BBC Natural History Unit headquarters in Bristol, but owing to the late hour of broadcast, all wildlife footage was prerecorded.\n\nThe 2010 \"Autumnwatch\" series was broadcast every Thursday from 7 October for 8 weeks. It was once again based at from the BBC Natural History Unit in Bristol. Simon King did not participate, and was replaced by a variety of reporters who took his slot each week.\n\nAutumnwatch returned with a new name, \"Autumnwatch Live\" on 7 October 2011. For the first four weeks it was presented from the National Arboretum at Westonbirt, and for the final four weeks, the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust's Slimbridge reserve, by Michaela Strachan, Chris Packham and Martin Hughes-Games. Each week there was a guest presenter who focused on one particular aspect of the British countryside. These included Bill Oddie. Kate Humble did not participate due to other projects.\n\nThe 2012 series of \"Autumnwatch\" started on 30 October 2012 and ran for 4 consecutive days. It was being broadcast live from the Aigas Field Centre in the Scottish Highlands. Iolo Williams reported on golden eagles from the Outer Hebrides. John Lister-Kaye, owner of the field centre, also appeared. The final episode was followed by a half-hour \"Unsprung\" programme.\n\n\"Autumnwatch\" returned on 29 October for four nights from a new location at RSPB Leighton Moss in Lancashire, with Unsprung following the final episode. A new live show \"Autumnwatch Extra\" aired on the red button and online each day.\n\n\"Autumnwatch\" 2014 returned to Leighton Moss, Lancashire, with companion \"Extra\" and \"Unsprung\" strands and webcams.\n\n\"Autumnwatch\" aired between 2 and 5 November 2015.\n\n\"Autumnwatch\" moved to RSPB Arne in Dorset.\n\nThe farmland of Sherborne Park, Gloucestershire became the host site for \"Autumnwatch\". The programme gained a new field reporter, Gillian Burke.\n\n\"Autumnwatch\" moved outside the UK for the first time, being broadcast from a site on the shores of Squam Lake in New Hampshire, United States, on four consecutive evenings from Monday 15 October. Packham and Strachan were joined by Gillian Burke.\n\n\"Autumnwatch\" was broadcast from a new site near Nethy Bridge on the edge of the Abernethy Forest in the Cairngorms National Park. Packham, Strachan and Burke continued as presenters and were joined by Iolo Williams.\n\nA one-off, hour-long \"Winterwatch\" was broadcast by the BBC on 22 February 2012, presented from the Brecon Beacons by Kate Humble, Chris Packham, and Martin Hughes-Games, with filmed segments by Charlie Hamilton James, Maya Plass, Gordon Buchanan, Michaela Strachan and Chris Watson.\n\nA four-day \"Winterwatch\" aired between 14 and 17 January 2013, again from Aigas, with an \"Unsprung\" programme following the final episode. Following that, there was a Winterwatch special, \"Winterwatch 1963 – The Big Freeze\", that was broadcast on 19 January.\n\n\"Winterwatch\" returned to BBC Two between 20 and 23 January 2014, broadcast live from the Mar Lodge Estate in Aberdeenshire, with Unsprung following the final episode hosted by Nick Baker. There was a special \"Winterwatch Extra: Garden Birds Special\" on the BBC Red Button and online from 24 to 26 January 2014 hosted by Euan McIlwraith and Richard Taylor-Jones, from various locations around Great Britain.\n\n\"Winterwatch\" returned to BBC Two between 19 and 22 January 2015, again broadcast live from the Mar Lodge Estate in Aberdeenshire.\n\nThe programme was again broadcast live from the Mar Lodge Estate in early-2016.\n\n\"Winterwatch\" moved to RSPB Arne in Dorset.\n\n\"Winterwatch\" was broadcast from Sherborne Park, over four evenings, starting on Monday 29 January, with contributions from Gillian Burke on the island of Islay in the Inner Hebrides.\n\n\"Winterwatch\" was broadcast over four evenings, starting on 29 January, from a new site near Nethy Bridge on the edge of the Abernethy Forest in the Cairngorms National Park. Packham, Strachan and Burke continued as presenters and were joined by Iolo Williams.\n\n\"Winterwatch\" was broadcast over four evenings, starting on Tuesday 28 January, from the same site as the previous series.\n\nFollowing Simon King's departure in 2010, the role of field reporter was filled by various guest presenters; notably Gordon Buchanan, Charlie Hamilton James, Iolo Williams, Liz Bonnin and Michaela Strachan. He was eventually replaced by Gillian Burke seven years later.\n\nOther presenters involved in the programmes include Roy Dennis, Johnny Kingdom, Leah Gooding, Richard Taylor-Jones, Chris Watson, Doug Allan, Andrew Agnew/PC Plum, Sidney Sloane, Nick Baker (presenter of \"Springwatch in the Afternoon\" in 2013 and \"Springwatch Unsprung\" in 2014), Euan McIlwraith and Brett Westwood (co-presenters of \"Springwatch Extra\" in 2014).\n\nIn the 2018 edition of Springwatch, several guest presenters rotated the role alongside Packham and Strachan, including Steve Backshall, Iolo Williams, Lucy Cooke and Patrick Aryee.\n\nFor \"Winterwatch\" and \"Autumnwatch 2019\" all four presenters were in the same location, with no field reporter. For \"Springwatch 2019\" Gillian Burke was a field reporter for episodes 1 to 11, returning to the main studio for the last show (episode 12).\n\nBeginning with the fifth series \"Springwatch\" in 2009, the \"Springwatch\" and \"Autumnwatch\" series have been accompanied by a live \"Unsprung\" programme, a half-hour show that airs once a week and answers viewers' wildlife questions, along with audience surveys and \"pub quizzes\" filmed in the main studio.\n\n\"Springwatch and Autumnwatch\" was published by Collins in April 2007, and features content from all the regular presenters to that date.\n\nThe theme music was commissioned by the BBC from independent composer David Poore, and was nominated for a Royal Television Society award in 2007.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1948561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1948561", "title": "Nest box", "text": "Nest box\n\nA nest box, also spelled nestbox, is a man-made enclosure provided for animals to nest in. Nest boxes are most frequently utilized for birds, in which case they are also called birdhouses or a birdbox/bird box, but some mammalian species such as bats may also use them. Placing nestboxes or roosting boxes may also be used to help maintain populations of particular species in an area. The modern nest box was invented by the British conservationist Charles Waterton in the early 19th century to encourage more birdlife and wildfowl on the nature reserve he set up on his estate.\n\nTraditional nest boxes have existed in many civilisations, since antiquity.\n\nNest boxes are getting more attention because industrialization, deforestation and other human activities since the mid-20th century have caused severe declines in birds' natural habitats, introducing hurdles to breeding. A nest box can help prevent bird extinction.\n\nNest boxes are usually wooden, although the purple martin will nest in metal. Some boxes are made from a mixture of wood and concrete, called \"woodcrete\". Ceramic and plastic nestboxes are not suitable.\n\nNest boxes should be made from untreated wood with an overhanging, sloped roof, a recessed floor, drainage and ventilation holes, a way to access the interior for monitoring and cleaning, and have no outside perches which could assist predators. Boxes may either have an entrance hole or be open-fronted. Some nest boxes can be highly decorated and complex, sometimes mimicking human houses or other structures. They may also contain nest box cameras so that use of, and activity within, the box can be monitored.\n\nThe diameter of the opening in a nest-box has a very strong influence on the species of birds that will use the box. Many small birds select boxes with a hole only just large enough for an adult bird to pass through. This may be an adaptation to prevent other birds from raiding it. In European countries, an opening of 2.5 cm in diameter will attract \"Poecile palustris\", \"Poecile montanus\"; an opening of 2.8 cm in diameter will attract \"Ficedula hypoleuca\", and an opening of 3 cm in diameter will attract \"Parus major\", \"Passer montanus\", an opening of 3.2 cm in diameter will attract \"Passer domesticus\".\n\nThe size of the nest box also affects the bird species likely to use the box. Very small boxes attract wrens and treecreepers and very large ones may attract ducks and owls. Seasonally removing old nest material and parasites is important if they are to be successfully re-used.\n\nThe material used in the construction may also be significant. Sparrows have been shown to prefer woodcrete boxes rather than wooden ones. Birds nesting in woodcrete sites had earlier clutches, a shorter incubation period, and more reproductive success, perhaps because the synthetic nests were warmer than their wooden counterparts.\n\nPlacement of the nest box is also significant. Some birds (including birds of prey) prefer their nest box to be at a particular height, while others (such as ducks) may prefer them to be very low or even at ground level. Orientation relative to the sun is also important, with many birds preferring their boxes to be away from direct sun and sheltered from the prevailing rain.\n\nBat boxes differ from bird nest-boxes in typical design, with the larger opening on the underside of the box, and are more often referred to as bat boxes, although in regard to the rearing of young, they serve the same purpose. Some threatened bat species can be locally supported with the provision of appropriately placed bat-boxes, however species that roost in foliage or large cavities will not use bat boxes. Bat boxes are typically made out of wood, and there are several designs for boxes with single or multiple chambers. Directions for making the open bottom bat houses for small and large colonies, as well as locations to purchase them are available on the internet. Colour and placement is important to ensuring that bat boxes are used; bat boxes that are too shaded will not heat up enough to attract a maternity colony of bats. Australian bat box projects have been running for over 12 years in particular at the Organ Pipes National Park. Currently there are 42 roost boxes using the \"Stebbings Design\" which have peaked at 280 bats roosting in them. The biggest problem with roosting boxes of any kind is the ongoing maintenance; problems include boxes falling down, wood deteriorating, and pests such as ants, the occasional rat, possums, and spiders.\n\nNest boxes are marketed not only for birds, but also for butterflies and other mammals, especially arboreal ones such as squirrels and opossums. Depending on the animal, these boxes may be used for roosting, breeding, or both. Or, as in the case with butterflies, hibernation.\n\nWasps, bumble-bees, or other insects may build their nests inside a nest box intended for other animals, and may exclude the intended species.\n\n\n"}

He started out at Everton before transferring to Blackburn Rovers and then, Liverpool. He made his senior debut for the Reds on 10 August 2004 as a substitute for Steve Finnan in a UEFA Champions League qualifier against Grazer AK, playing the last five minutes, and the whole of the return leg at home. In total, he made 10 appearances in the 2004–05 season, mostly in cup competitions. He featured in Liverpool's run to the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final, coming on as a substitute in the round of 16 home tie against Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nThe following season, he was involved in pre-season friendlies and the Champions League qualifying rounds but did not feature in the Premier League. Instead, he saw league action on loan at Championship side Southampton, during the second half of the season. He joined Southampton on loan in January 2006, making a total of 12 appearances, remaining with the club until the end of the season.\n\nHe returned to Anfield in the summer but was swiftly loaned out again, this time to another Championship club, Wolves, for the 2006–07 season. After impressing, the move was made permanent in a £250,000 three-and-a-half-year deal during the January 2007 transfer window. Potter scored his first and only Wolves goal in the FA Cup against Oldham Athletic on 16 January 2007.\n\nHis second season with Wolves was less successful though, and manager Mick McCarthy offered him the option of going on the transfer list during the January transfer window to seek more playing time at a new club. Potter rejected the offer and remained at Molineux for the rest of the season, however the club transfer-listed him at its conclusion. After finding no takers for him during the Summer transfer window, he was taken off the transfer list and told to fight for his place.\n\nHe failed to appear for his parent club during the first half of the 2008–09 season, and joined Sheffield Wednesday on loan in January 2009, remaining there until the end of the season. Potter scored for the Owls 16 minutes into his debut against Charlton with a 30-yard drive into the bottom corner. He also hit the bar from a free kick in the 4–1 win.\n\nHe signed for Sheffield Wednesday in a permanent deal on 10 July 2009 for an undisclosed fee. Potter scored his first goal of the 2009–10 season on 22 August in a 4–0 thumping of newly promoted Scunthorpe United. His next goal was to be much later on in the season with a left-footed curler in the bottom corner against Blackpool at Hillsborough on 9 February. Potter added to his tally for the season with a volley against Wednesday's fierce rivals Sheffield United in the Steel City Derby on 19 April. Potter left Hillsborough on 23 June 2011 by mutual consent.\n\nOn 23 June 2011, Potter signed a one-year contract for Milton Keynes Dons. On 21 February 2014, Potter signed a new two-year contract extension.\n\nOn 24 April 2017, after 6 seasons, 266 appearances and 12 goals, Milton Keynes Dons announced that Potter would be leaving the club at the end of the 2016–17 season.\n\nOn 14 June 2017, Potter signed a two-year contract with Rotherham United. In December 2017 he suffered an achilles injury which required two operations, and which kept him out of action until the final match of the 2018–19 season. He was released at the end of the 2018–19 when his contract expired.\n\nOn 28 June 2019, Potter signed a one-year contract with Tranmere Rovers.\n\nPotter has been capped multiple times for Republic of Ireland youth teams – appearing at the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship – and later made his debut for Ireland's senior team in a friendly against Ecuador in Giants Stadium, New York on 23 May 2007.\n\nLiverpool\n\nMilton Keynes Dons\n\nIndividual\n\n"}

Since 1988 it has been part of the Rolls-Royce Power Engineering group.\n\nMore than 100,000 Crossley oil and gas engines have been built.\n\nCrossley Brothers was set up in 1867 by brothers Francis (1839–97) and William J.(1844–1911). Francis, with help from his uncle, bought the engineering business of John M Dunlop at Great Marlborough Street in Manchester city centre, including manufacturing pumps, presses, and small steam engines. William (\"Sir\" William from 1910 – Baronet) joined his brother shortly after the purchase. The company name was initially changed to Crossley Brothers and Dunlop. Each of the brothers had served engineering apprenticeships: Francis, known as Frank, at Robert Stephenson and Company; and William at W.G. Armstrong, both in Newcastle upon Tyne. William concentrated on the business side, Frank provided the engineering expertise.\n\nThe brothers were committed Christians and strictly teetotal, refusing to supply their products to companies such as breweries, whom they did not approve of. They adopted the early Christian symbol of the Coptic cross as the emblem to use on their road vehicles.\n\nIn 1869 they had the foresight to acquire the UK and world (except German) rights to the patents of Otto and Langden of Cologne for the new gas fueled atmospheric internal combustion engine and in 1876 these rights were extended to the famous Otto four-stroke cycle engine. The changeover to four stroke engines was remarkably rapid with the last atmospheric engines being made in 1877.\n\nThe business flourished. In 1881, Crossley Brothers became a private limited company (\"i.e.\" Crossley Brothers Ltd.), and then in 1882 it moved to larger premises in Pottery Lane, Openshaw, in eastern Manchester.\n\nFurther technical improvements also followed, including the introduction of poppet valves and the hot-tube ignitor in 1888 and the introduction of the carburettor, allowing volatile liquid fuels to be used.\n\nBy adopting the heavier fuelled \"oil\" engine, the first one being demonstrated in 1891, the company's future was assured. Among other applications, these \"oil\" engines were used with Gwynnes Centrifugal Pumps for irrigation. Then in 1896, they obtained rights to the diesel system, which used the heat of compression alone to ignite the fuel. Their first diesel was built in 1898.\n\nBy the turn of the century, there was also some production of petrol engines, and from 1901 these engines were finding their way into road vehicles, including, in 1905, Leyland buses.\n\nA major contribution to manufacturing was the introduction of the assembly line. The Crossley system even influenced Henry Ford, who visited Pottery Lane at the turn of the century.\n\nIn 1904 the company started production of motor cars and a separate company, Crossley Motors Ltd. was registered on 11 April 1906.\n\nThis company was sold to Associated Equipment Company (AEC) in 1948, and vehicle production continued until 1958.\n\nIn 1919 Crossley Brothers bought Premier Gas Engines of Sandiacre, Nottingham, who built very large engines, and in 1935 changed their name to Crossley Premier Engines Ltd. The Nottingham factory was expanded, and production continued there until 1966.\n\nThe engines were large horizontal heavy oil engines, typically used as generating plants or to power industrial plant such as air compressors, water pumps or mills. They were produced in a range of sizes, based on a standard cylinder unit, as either in-line or horizontally-opposed cylinder engines. They had clerestory combustion chambers with single inlet and exhaust valves above and below the chamber. Other manufacturers at the time, notably Brush, produced very similar engines as modular, opposed cylinder units. Crossley's were distinctive for using a monobloc head on each cylinder, although this was in the form of a self-supporting wet liner and the water jacket around the whole cylinder bank was a separate casting. The engines were also unusual for being one of the few practical applications of an electrically-driven supercharger. This gave a relatively low boost pressure and was more of a scavenge blower, but it could increase output power by up to 50%.\n\nA pair of 16 cylinder opposed engines of 3,500 bhp, built for electrical generation in Jerusalem in the 1930s, were at the time the largest oil engines in the world. Like the earlier Ferranti steam generating plants, these placed half of the engine each side of a centrally-mounted alternator, thus reducing the maximum load on the crankshaft. A similar engine in a bombproof underground shelter was used to power the wartime \"Aspidistra\" transmitter.\n\nBy the 1960s, although sales remained reasonable, the company had become unprofitable. The design of the engines then being made was essentially 40 years old, so in 1962 agreement was reached to use the French Pielstick design. Production of these engines, intended for ships, railway locomotives and electricity generation, was initially carried out at Nottingham. But, before the engines could become established, the money ran out and the company had to call in the receivers. A purchaser was found in Belliss and Morcom Ltd. but the name Crossley-Premier was kept.\n\nThe market for engines was continuing to shrink, and in 1968 the new company joined the Amalgamated Power Engineering (APE) group and the name became APE-Crossley Ltd. For the first time the new company used the Coptic Cross logo on the engines. Previously, this had only appeared on Crossley Motors products — the rights to use it had to be bought from British Leyland. APE, in its turn, became part of Northern Engineering Industries (NEI) in 1981, and the company name became NEI-Allen Limited – Crossley Engines.\n\nNEI themselves, in 1988, were taken over by Rolls Royce plc, and the company became part of the Allen Power Engineering – Crossley Engines division of the Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group. This, in turn, became Crossley Engines division of Rolls-Royce Power Engineering, continuing to produce the Crossley-Pielstick range until 1995.\n\nThe Crossley Works on Pottery Lane was closed on 27 February 2009, with what remains of the business being relocated to a Rolls-Royce factory in Dunfermline. Demolition of the works began in December 2009.\n\nCrossley Brothers built diesel engines for stationary, marine and locomotive use. There was a wide range of engines from six to 3200 horsepower (Crossley) and up to 9000 horsepower (Crossley-Pielstick).\n\nTheir marine engines had a reputation for durability and reliability. However, their rush to be a part of the emerging railway traction market was an unmitigated disaster.\n\nCrossley apparently took one of its successful World War II Patrol Boat motors and re-engineered it for railway service. This resulted in the construction of;\n\nAll were two stroke engines equipped with Crossley's system of exhaust pulse pressure charging whereby surplus air in the exhaust manifold was forced back into the cylinder by the exhaust pulse from a neighbouring cylinder. \n\nCrossley's foray into rail motive power construction was disastrous, with all but those installed in the WAGR X class having a very short working life. Motor failures occurred within months of the various classes being introduced. The WAGR Crossleys underwent over 600 modifications in their service life. The CIE 001 Class were re-motored with EMD engines between 1968 and 1971 and the CIE 201 Class between 1969 and 1972.\n\nCrossley Brothers obtained numerous patents for improvements to internal combustion engines. One example is a waste heat recovery unit, British patent no. 305 of 1915.\n\n\n\n"}

Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Chania, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of . Its ancient name was \"Kiamon\" while the Byzantines called it \"Charaka\". The seat of Akrotiri municipality was Pythari. Stavros became famous because of the film Zorba the Greek.\n\nAkrotiri is a rocky promontory on the northern side of the island of Crete, in the Sea of Crete. It is roughly circular in shape, connected to the rest of the island by a wide causeway between Chania and the town of Souda. To the south, Souda Bay is found between the peninsula and the island. Most of the peninsula is a plateau somewhat elevated from the sea. There is a string of hills along the northern coast. A variety of flora occur on the rocky promontory of Akrotiri including the herb \"Taraxacum minimum\".\n\nThe earliest history of the local area is related to the founding of the nearby ancient city of Kydonia, one of the most powerful cities of ancient Crete.\n\nThe tombs of Eleftherios Venizelos and his son Sophoklis are found on Akrotiri, at a site overlooking Chania.

The imposing buildings are visible across the plateau and from planes arriving at the airport and are set in olive and orange groves. A little way into the hills, accessible by car through a small gorge, is the Gouvernetos Monastery, 5 km north of Aghia Triada. Here the buildings appear fortress-like, with a large square building around a central courtyard, in which stands the church dedicated to the Virgin Mary.\n\nFrom Gouverneto Monastery, the path is only accessible by foot and leads to the cave of the Arkoudiotissa (\"she-bear\"), where a stalagmite is said to look like a bear. This cave is believed to have been used for worship since ancient times (as there is evidence for cults of Artemis and Apollo), but was dedicated to the Arkoudiotissa Panaghia (Our Lady) during the Christian era. Ascetics lived in the caves in the area. Further along the path, after a descent of 140 steps, is the Katholikon (monastic church), the third monastery, now abandoned. It is believed to date from the 5th or 6th Century, founded by St John the Hermit. It is built into the cliff, with a unique church largely carved into the rock-face. This striking set of buildings is now overgrown with fig trees but retains significant charm.\n\nChania's airport, Chania/Ioannis Daskalogiannis International Airport (IATA: CHQ, ICAO:LGSA), named after folk-hero Daskalogiannis, is on the central plateau and is easily reached from Chania by car, taxi or public transport.

In 1979, she made her acting debut in the low-budget feature \"A Certain Sacrifice\". Its commercial release in 1985 coincided with the success of her second studio album, \"Like a Virgin\". That same year, she made a cameo appearance as a club singer in the film \"Vision Quest\"; she also garnered commercial and critical success for the title role in Susan Seidelman's \"Desperately Seeking Susan\". Madonna followed it with a leading role in the adventure drama \"Shanghai Surprise\" (1986), with her then-husband, actor Sean Penn. The film was panned by critics, and Madonna received her first Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress. Her next films such as \"Who's That Girl\" (1987) and \"Bloodhounds of Broadway\" (1989) were critical and commercial failures. In 1986, she made her theatrical debut in David Rabe's \"Goose and Tom-Tom\" and her first commercial for Mitsubishi in Japan. She starred in the 1989 commercial for Pepsi-Cola alongside her song \"Like a Prayer\". Due to the controversy surrounding the song's music video, the commercial was revoked and her contract with Pepsi-Cola was cancelled.\n\nIn 1990, Madonna starred as Breathless Mahoney in \"Dick Tracy\", directed by Warren Beatty and based on Chester Gould's comic strip. She received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Actress. Beatty later appeared in her 1991 documentary, \"\", which showed behind the scenes of her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour. It was the highest-grossing documentary of all time at that point. She also received positive reviews for her role in \"A League of Their Own\" (1992), which was centered on a women's baseball team during World War II. In 1993, Madonna starred in the erotic thriller \"Body of Evidence\", which performed poorly at the box office. Her subsequent films saw Madonna take on smaller roles, including a singing telegram girl in \"Blue in the Face\" (1995), a witch in \"Four Rooms\" (1995), and a phone sex company owner in Spike Lee's \"Girl 6\" (1996). Madonna starred as Eva Perón in the 1996 film adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical \"Evita\". Her performance was acclaimed by critics and won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.\n\nMadonna was again received negatively for her leading role as Abbie in John Schlesinger's film \"The Next Best Thing\" (2000). Her first big screen collaboration, with her then-husband director Guy Ritchie, was \"Swept Away\" (2002). A remake of Lina Wertmüller's Italian film of the same name, it was as a commercial and critical failure. \"Swept Away\" was nominated for seven Golden Raspberry Awards, winning five, including Worst Actress for Madonna. She had a cameo appearance in the James Bond film \"Die Another Day\" (2002), and sang its theme song. The next year, Madonna appeared in the television sitcom \"Will & Grace\"s episode \"Dolls and Dolls\". In 2008, Madonna made her directorial debut with \"Filth and Wisdom\", as well as producing and writing \"I Am Because We Are\", a documentary on the problems faced by Malawians. The latter was honored with a Do Something Award by VH1. Her second directorial effort, \"W.E.\", was released in 2011. A biographical film about the affair between King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson, the film was critically and commercially unsuccessful. She also directed the 17-minute film \"secretprojectrevolution\" with Steven Klein in 2013. Dealing with artistic freedom and human rights, the short film was distributed by BitTorrent. Madonna's acting career has attracted a largely negative reception from critics. Stephanie Zacharek from \"Time\" stated: \"[Madonna] seems wooden and unnatural as an actress, and it's tough to watch, because she's clearly trying her damnedest.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1948615", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1948615", "title": "Belfast Lough", "text": "Belfast Lough\n\nBelfast Lough is a large, intertidal sea inlet on the east coast of Northern Ireland. At its head is the city and port of Belfast, which sits at the mouth of the River Lagan. The lough opens into the North Channel and connects Belfast to the Irish Sea.\n\nBelfast Lough is a long, wide and deep expanse of water, virtually free of strong tides. The inner part of the lough comprises a series of mudflats and lagoons. The outer lough is restricted to mainly rocky shores with some small sandy bays. The outer boundary of the lough is a line joining Orlock Point and Blackhead.\n\nThe main coastal towns are Bangor on the southern shore (County Down) and Carrickfergus on the northern shore (County Antrim). Other coastal settlements include Holywood, Helen's Bay, Greenisland and Whitehead.\n\nBelfast Lough is known in Irish as \"Loch Lao\", which was Anglicised as 'Lough Lee'. Earlier spellings include \"Loch Laoigh\" and \"Loch Laigh\". This name means \"sea inlet of the calf\". The River Lagan, which flows into it, was also historically known as the \"Lao\". It is believed that the lough and river were named after a \"bovine goddess\". In the 2nd century, the Greek geographer Ptolemy referred to it as the \"Logia\".\n\nBefore Belfast grew into a city, the lough was known in English as 'Carrickfergus Bay'. In Ulster-Scots it is called \"Bilfawst Loch\" or \"Craigfergus Loch\".\n\nIn 1689 during the War of the Two Kings the Williamite expeditionary force under Marshal Schomberg landed at Bangor, after the lough had been cleared of French shipping by George Rooke. Schomberg occupied the towns of Bangor and Belfast, before successfully laying siege to Carrickfergus. The following year William III also used the lough as a safe anchorage when he arrived in Ireland with reinforcements for Schomberg in the run-up to the victory over the Jacobite army at the Battle of the Boyne.\n\nThe reserve is situated within the Belfast Harbour Estate on the shores of Belfast Lough. The RSPB manages some mudflats in Belfast Lough, together with an area of grassland with a pool and ditch complex near Belfast City Airport, and a lagoon with a hide and viewpoints. The mudflats are important feeding areas for a variety of wading birds and wildfowl. At high tide, flocks of wading birds, such as redshank, oystercatchers and black-tailed godwits, can be seen from the hide and viewing points.\nThe \"inner lough\" was made an Area of Special Scientific Interest (ASSI) in 1987.\n\nRecorded wildlife includes \"Crepidula fornicata\" Lamarck (Slipper Limpet).\n\nThe Belfast Lough Ramsar site (wetlands of international importance designated under the Ramsar Convention), is 432.14 hectares in area, at latitude 54 38 00 N and longitude 05 54 00 W. It was designated a Ramsar site on 5 August 1998. The site contains the inner part of the lough including areas of intertidal foreshore, consisting of mudflats and lagoons, and land, both reclaimed and being reclaimed, which form important feeding/roosting sites for significant numbers of wintering waders and wildfowl. The outer lough is restricted to mainly rocky shores with some small sandy bays and beach-head salt marsh.\n\nIn the outer lough, the Ramsar boundary entirely coincides with that of Outer Belfast Lough Area of Special Scientific Interest but within the immediate harbour area the boundary has been redrawn to take into account permitted port related development and landfill which has taken place since the Inner Belfast Lough Area of Special Scientific Interest was declared in 1987. Marine areas below mean low water are not included. The Ramsar boundary entirely coincides with that of the Belfast Lough Special Protection Area. The site qualifies under Criterion 3c of the Ramsar Convention by regularly supporting internationally important numbers of common redshank in winter. The site also regularly supports nationally important numbers of common shelduck, Eurasian oystercatcher, purple sandpiper, dunlin, black-tailed godwit, bar-tailed godwit, Eurasian curlew and ruddy turnstone.\n\nPopular for sailing, the lough has three marinas: one at Bangor, one at Carrickfegus and a third located at Titanic Quarter. Belfast docks at the head of a lough contain the famous shipbuilder of the RMS \"Titanic\" fame, Harland & Wolff, who are no longer building ships for the foreseeable future and has shed most of its workforce and diversified into repairing and refitting large tankers and oilrigs. Coastguard offices for the lough, although referred to as \"Belfast Coastguard\", are located in the town of Bangor by the marina. In 1912, the RMS Titanic sailed down the lough from Belfast to the Irish Sea for its sea trials.\n\nThe lough hosts two Royal Yacht Clubs. One at Cultra just outside Holywood, \"The Royal North of Ireland Yacht Club\", and the \"Royal Ulster\" based from Bangor. There are also several other clubs spread around the lough: Ballyholme Yacht Club, Carrickfergus Sailing Club, Cockle Island Boat Club, County Antrim Yacht Club, Donaghadee Sailing Club and Holywood Yacht Club.\n\nFor racing sailors, this is a competitor's dream, giving of open water and enough coastline to make short inshore races day-long affairs. Three main arteries serve the lough close to Belfast: the Herdman Channel on the County Antrim coast side; the Victoria Channel, the central and longest route; and the Musgrave Channel on the County Down side.\n\nThe Belfast-Larne railway line skirts the north shore particularly from Carrickfergus and then Downshire to Whitehead and northwards then alongside Larne Lough to Larne Harbour. Trains connect Belfast Great Victoria Street and Belfast Central to Larne Harbour.\n\nThe Belfast-Bangor railway line skirts the south shore at Holywood railway station to Marino railway station and Cultra railway station. Trains connect Belfast Great Victoria Street and Belfast Central to Bangor.\n\nCultra railway station is the home of the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum.\n\n\n"}

She is known to be a devoted fan of paranormal author Jozef Rulof.\n\nIn 1991, she gained national fame after making an appearance on a popular talk show. In the next decade, she held public gatherings in Tiel where she announced that she would be performing healings, which drew large groups of people. During these sessions she would 'infuse' bottles of tap water, which she claimed would make them gain healing properties. She also appeared on radio shows, where people were asked to put a bottle of water in front of their radio in order to have it remotely 'infused'.\n\nIn 2001 Jomanda gave medical and spiritual advice to the popular Dutch actress Sylvia Millecam, who later died of cancer.

In October 2006, the investigation was dropped, but in April 2008 an Amsterdam court ruled that Jomanda and two doctors who practise alternative therapies should be prosecuted for their roles in Millecam's death.\nThe trial started at 30 October 2008. On 12 May 2009 Ronald ter Heegde, Jomanda's former assistant, admitted on television in the Dutch newsmagazine \"Nova\" that Jomanda had used other persons to gather information about Sylvia Millecam. She then told Millecam she had gathered this information as a medium. On 12 June 2009 the court found Jomanda not guilty as a party to Millecam's death. The court criticised her actions, but stated that she could not be held fully responsible for Millecam's fate.\n\nThe Dutch Federation Against Quacks (Nederlandse Vereniging tegen de Kwakzalverij) listed Jomanda as #15 on their top 20 list of quacks.\n\nIn October 2004 Jomanda drew publicity again by stating, in accordance with the ideas of Jozef Rulof, 'Cremation hurts'.\n\n"}

Neuroplasticity was once thought to only occur during childhood, but some degree of neuroplasticity may occur throughout an individual's life, e.g., brain activity associated with a given function can be transferred to a different location, the proportion of grey matter can change and synapses may strengthen or weaken over time. The aim of neuroplasticity is to optimize the neural networks during phylogenesis, ontogeny and physiological learning, as well as after a brain injury. Research in the latter half of the 20th century showed that many aspects of the brain can be altered (or are \"plastic\") even through adulthood. However, the developing brain exhibits a higher degree of plasticity than the adult brain.\n\nNeuroplasticity can be observed at multiple scales, from microscopic changes in individual neurons to larger-scale changes such as cortical remapping in response to injury. Behavior, environmental stimuli, thought, meditation and emotions may also cause neuroplastic change through activity-dependent plasticity, which has significant implications for healthy development, learning, memory, and recovery from brain damage. At the single cell level, synaptic plasticity refers to changes in the connections between neurons, where as non-synaptic plasticity refers to changes in their intrinsic excitability.\nThe term \"plasticity\" was first applied to behavior in 1890 by William James in \"The Principles of Psychology\". The first person to use the term \"neural plasticity\" appears to have been the Polish neuroscientist Jerzy Konorski.\n\nIn 1793, Italian anatomist Michele Vicenzo Malacarne described experiments in which he paired animals, trained one of the pair extensively for years, and then dissected both. He discovered that the cerebellums of the trained animals were substantially larger. But these findings were eventually forgotten. The idea that the brain and its function are not fixed throughout adulthood was proposed in 1890 by William James in \"The Principles of Psychology\", though the idea was largely neglected. Until around the 1970s, neuroscientists believed that the brain's structure and function was essentially fixed throughout adulthood.\n\nWhile the brain was commonly understood as a nonrenewable organ in the early 1900s, Santiago Ramón y Cajal, \"father of neuroscience\", used the term neuronal plasticity to describe nonpathological changes in the structure of adult brains. Based on his renowned Neuron Doctrine, Cajal first described the neuron as the fundamental unit of the nervous system that later served as an essential foundation to develop the concept of neural plasticity. He used the term plasticity in reference to his work on findings of degeneration and regeneration in the central nervous system after a person had reached adulthood, specifically. Many neuroscientists used the term plasticity only to explain the regenerative capacity of the peripheral nervous system, which Cajal's conceptual transfer of the term gave rise to a controversial discussion.\n\nThe term has since been broadly applied:\n\nIn 1923, Karl Lashley conducted experiments on rhesus monkeys that demonstrated changes in neuronal pathways, which he concluded were evidence of plasticity. Despite this, and other research that suggested plasticity took place, neuroscientists did not widely accept the idea of neuroplasticity.\n\nIn 1945, Justo Gonzalo concluded from his research of brain dynamics, that, contrary to the activity of the projection areas, the \"central\" cortical mass (more or less equidistant from the visual, tactile and auditive projection areas), would be a \"maneuvering mass\", rather unspecific or multisensory, with capacity to increase neural excitability and re-organize the activity by means of plasticity properties. He gives as a first example of adaptation, to see upright with reversing glasses in the Stratton experiment, and specially, several first-hand brain injuries cases in which he observed dynamic and adaptive properties in their disorders, in particular in the inverted perception disorder [e.g., see pp 260–62 Vol. I (1945), p 696 Vol. II (1950)]. He stated that a sensory signal in a projection area would be only an inverted and constricted outline that would be magnified due to the increase in recruited cerebral mass, and re-inverted due to some effect of brain plasticity, in more central areas, following a spiral growth.\n\nMarian Diamond of the University of California, Berkeley, produced the first scientific evidence of anatomical brain plasticity, publishing her research in 1964.\n\nOther significant evidence was produced in the 1960s and after, notably from scientists including Paul Bach-y-Rita, Michael Merzenich along with Jon Kaas, as well as several others.\n\nIn the 1960s, Paul Bach-y-Rita invented a device that was tested on a small number of people, and involved a person sitting in a chair, in which were embedded nubs that were made to vibrate in ways that translated images received in a camera, allowing a form of vision via sensory substitution.\n\nStudies in people recovering from stroke also provided support for neuroplasticity, as regions of the brain remained healthy could sometimes take over, at least in part, functions that had been destroyed; Shepherd Ivory Franz did work in this area.\n\nEleanor Maguire documented changes in hippocampal structure associated with acquiring the knowledge of London's layout in local taxi drivers. A redistribution of grey matter was indicated in London Taxi Drivers compared to controls. This work on hippocampal plasticity not only interested scientists, but also engaged the public and media worldwide.\n\nMichael Merzenich is a neuroscientist who has been one of the pioneers of neuroplasticity for over three decades. He has made some of \"the most ambitious claims for the field – that brain exercises may be as useful as drugs to treat diseases as severe as schizophrenia – that plasticity exists from cradle to the grave, and that radical improvements in cognitive functioning – how we learn, think, perceive, and remember are possible even in the elderly.\" Merzenich's work was affected by a crucial discovery made by David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel in their work with kittens. The experiment involved sewing one eye shut and recording the cortical brain maps. Hubel and Wiesel saw that the portion of the kitten's brain associated with the shut eye was not idle, as expected. Instead, it processed visual information from the open eye. It was \"…as though the brain didn't want to waste any 'cortical real estate' and had found a way to rewire itself.\"\n\nThis implied neuroplasticity during the critical period. However, Merzenich argued that neuroplasticity could occur beyond the critical period. His first encounter with adult plasticity came when he was engaged in a postdoctoral study with Clinton Woosley. The experiment was based on observation of what occurred in the brain when one peripheral nerve was cut and subsequently regenerated. The two scientists micromapped the hand maps of monkey brains before and after cutting a peripheral nerve and sewing the ends together. Afterwards, the hand map in the brain that they expected to be jumbled was nearly normal. This was a substantial breakthrough. Merzenich asserted that, \"If the brain map could normalize its structure in response to abnormal input, the prevailing view that we are born with a hardwired system had to be wrong. The brain had to be plastic.\" Merzenich received the 2016 Kavli Prize in Neuroscience \"for the discovery of mechanisms that allow experience and neural activity to remodel brain function.\"\n\nJT Wall and J Xu have traced the mechanisms underlying neuroplasticity. Re-organization is not cortically emergent, but occurs at every level in the processing hierarchy; this produces the map changes observed in the cerebral cortex.\n\nChristopher Shaw and Jill McEachern (eds) in \"Toward a theory of Neuroplasticity\", state that there is no all-inclusive theory that overarches different frameworks and systems in the study of neuroplasticity. However, researchers often describe neuroplasticity as “the ability to make adaptive changes related to the structure and function of the nervous system.\" Correspondingly, two types of neuroplasticity are often discussed: structural neuroplasticity and functional neuroplasticity.\n\nStructural plasticity is often understood as the brain's ability to change its neuronal connections. New neurons are constantly produced and integrated into the central nervous system throughout the life span based on this type of neuroplasticity. Researchers nowadays use multiple cross-sectional imaging methods (i.e. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography (CT)) to study the structural alterations of the human brains. This type of neuroplasticity often studies the effect of various internal or external stimuli on the brain’s anatomical reorganization. The changes of grey matter proportion or the synaptic strength in the brain are considered as examples of structural neuroplasticity. Structural neuroplasticity is currently investigated more within the field of neuroscience in current academia.\n\nFunctional plasticity refers to brain's ability to alter and adapt the functional properties of neurons. The changes can occur in response to previous activity (activity-dependent plasticity) to acquire memory or in response to malfunction or damage of neurons (reactive plasticity) to compensate a pathological event. In the latter case the functions from one part of the brain transfer to another part of the brain based on the demand to produce recovery of behavioral or physiological processes. Regarding physiological forms of activity-dependent plasticity, those involving synapses are referred to as synaptic plasticity. Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are considered as examples of synaptic plasticity that are associated with memory. More recently it has become clearer that synaptic plasticity can be complemented by another form of activity-dependent plasticity involving the intrinsic excitability of neurons, which is referred to as intrinsic plasticity. This, as opposed to homeostatic plasticity does not necessarily maintain the overall activity of a neuron within a network but contributes to encoding memories. Studies have shown that different life experience such as juggling, video-game playing, or musical training is associated with functional plasticity.\n\nThe adult brain is not entirely \"hard-wired\" with fixed neuronal circuits. There are many instances of cortical and subcortical rewiring of neuronal circuits in response to training as well as in response to injury. There is solid evidence that neurogenesis (birth of brain cells) occurs in the adult, mammalian brain—and such changes can persist well into old age. The evidence for neurogenesis is mainly restricted to the hippocampus and olfactory bulb, but current research has revealed that other parts of the brain, including the cerebellum, may be involved as well. However, the degree of rewiring induced by the integration of new neurons in the established circuits is not known, and such rewiring may well be functionally redundant.\n\nThere is now ample evidence for the active, experience-dependent re-organization of the synaptic networks of the brain involving multiple inter-related structures including the cerebral cortex. The specific details of how this process occurs at the molecular and ultrastructural levels are topics of active neuroscience research. The way experience can influence the synaptic organization of the brain is also the basis for a number of theories of brain function including the general theory of mind and Neural Darwinism. The concept of neuroplasticity is also central to theories of memory and learning that are associated with experience-driven alteration of synaptic structure and function in studies of classical conditioning in invertebrate animal models such as \"Aplysia\".\n\nA surprising consequence of neuroplasticity is that the brain activity associated with a given function can be transferred to a different location; this can result from normal experience and also occurs in the process of recovery from brain injury. Neuroplasticity is the fundamental issue that supports the scientific basis for treatment of acquired brain injury with goal-directed experiential therapeutic programs in the context of rehabilitation approaches to the functional consequences of the injury.\n\nNeuroplasticity is gaining popularity as a theory that, at least in part, explains improvements in functional outcomes with physical therapy post-stroke. Rehabilitation techniques that are supported by evidence which suggest cortical reorganization as the mechanism of change include constraint-induced movement therapy, functional electrical stimulation, treadmill training with body-weight support, and virtual reality therapy. Robot assisted therapy is an emerging technique, which is also hypothesized to work by way of neuroplasticity, though there is currently insufficient evidence to determine the exact mechanisms of change when using this method.\n\nOne group has developed a treatment that includes increased levels of progesterone injections in brain-injured patients. \"Administration of progesterone after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke reduces edema, inflammation, and neuronal cell death, and enhances spatial reference memory and sensory motor recovery.\" In a clinical trial, a group of severely injured patients had a 60% reduction in mortality after three days of progesterone injections. However, a study published in the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" in 2014 detailing the results of a multi-center NIH-funded phase III clinical trial of 882 patients found that treatment of acute traumatic brain injury with the hormone progesterone provides no significant benefit to patients when compared with placebo.\n\nFor decades, researchers assumed that humans had to acquire binocular vision, in particular stereopsis, in early childhood or they would never gain it. In recent years, however, successful improvements in persons with amblyopia, convergence insufficiency or other stereo vision anomalies have become prime examples of neuroplasticity; binocular vision improvements and stereopsis recovery are now active areas of scientific and clinical research.\n\nBrain training refers to so-called cognitive training techniques. Some companies are now offering brain training computer programs, especially internet or computer based brain training. \n\nNeuroplasticity is involved in the development of sensory function. The brain is born immature and it adapts to sensory inputs after birth. In the auditory system, congenital hearing impairment, a rather frequent inborn condition affecting 1 of 1000 newborns, has been shown to affect auditory development, and implantation of a sensory prostheses activating the auditory system has prevented the deficits and induced functional maturation of the auditory system. Due to a sensitive period for plasticity, there is also a sensitive period for such intervention within the first 2–4 years of life. Consequently, in prelingually deaf children, early cochlear implantation, as a rule, allows the children to learn the mother language and acquire acoustic communication.\n\nIn the phenomenon of phantom limb sensation, a person continues to feel pain or sensation within a part of their body that has been amputated. This is strangely common, occurring in 60–80% of amputees. An explanation for this is based on the concept of neuroplasticity, as the cortical maps of the removed limbs are believed to have become engaged with the area around them in the postcentral gyrus. This results in activity within the surrounding area of the cortex being misinterpreted by the area of the cortex formerly responsible for the amputated limb.\n\nThe relationship between phantom limb sensation and neuroplasticity is a complex one. In the early 1990s V.S. Ramachandran theorized that phantom limbs were the result of cortical remapping. However, in 1995 Herta Flor and her colleagues demonstrated that cortical remapping occurs only in patients who have phantom pain. Her research showed that phantom limb pain (rather than referred sensations) was the perceptual correlate of cortical reorganization. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as maladaptive plasticity.\n\nIn 2009 Lorimer Moseley and Peter Brugger carried out a remarkable experiment in which they encouraged arm amputee subjects to use visual imagery to contort their phantom limbs into impossible configurations. Four of the seven subjects succeeded in performing impossible movements of the phantom limb. This experiment suggests that the subjects had modified the neural representation of their phantom limbs and generated the motor commands needed to execute impossible movements in the absence of feedback from the body. The authors stated that: \"In fact, this finding extends our understanding of the brain's plasticity because it is evidence that profound changes in the mental representation of the body can be induced purely by internal brain mechanisms—the brain truly does change itself.\"\n\nIndividuals who suffer from chronic pain experience prolonged pain at sites that may have been previously injured, yet are otherwise currently healthy. This phenomenon is related to neuroplasticity due to a maladaptive reorganization of the nervous system, both peripherally and centrally. During the period of tissue damage, noxious stimuli and inflammation cause an elevation of nociceptive input from the periphery to the central nervous system. Prolonged nociception from the periphery then elicits a neuroplastic response at the cortical level to change its somatotopic organization for the painful site, inducing central sensitization. For instance, individuals experiencing complex regional pain syndrome demonstrate a diminished cortical somatotopic representation of the hand contralaterally as well as a decreased spacing between the hand and the mouth. Additionally, chronic pain has been reported to significantly reduce the volume of grey matter in the brain globally, and more specifically at the prefrontal cortex and right thalamus. However, following treatment, these abnormalities in cortical reorganization and grey matter volume are resolved, as well as their symptoms. Similar results have been reported for phantom limb pain, chronic low back pain and carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\nA number of studies have linked meditation practice to differences in cortical thickness or density of gray matter. One of the most well-known studies to demonstrate this was led by Sara Lazar, from Harvard University, in 2000. Richard Davidson, a neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin, has led experiments in cooperation with the Dalai Lama on effects of meditation on the brain. His results suggest that long-term or short-term practice of meditation results in different levels of activity in brain regions associated with such qualities as attention, anxiety, depression, fear, anger, and the ability of the body to heal itself. These functional changes may be caused by changes in the physical structure of the brain.\n\nAerobic exercise promotes adult neurogenesis by increasing the production of neurotrophic factors (compounds that promote growth or survival of neurons), such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Exercise-induced neurogenesis in the hippocampus is associated with measurable improvements in spatial memory. Consistent aerobic exercise over a period of several months induces marked clinically significant improvements in executive function (i.e., the \"cognitive control\" of behavior) and increased gray matter volume in multiple brain regions, particularly those that give rise to cognitive control. The brain structures that show the greatest improvements in gray matter volume in response to aerobic exercise are the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus; moderate improvements are seen in the anterior cingulate cortex, parietal cortex, cerebellum, caudate nucleus, and nucleus accumbens. Higher physical fitness scores (measured by VO max) are associated with better executive function, faster processing speed, and greater volume of the hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and nucleus accumbens.\n\nHuman echolocation is a learned ability for humans to sense their environment from echoes. This ability is used by some blind people to navigate their environment and sense their surroundings in detail. Studies in 2010 and 2011 using functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques have shown that parts of the brain associated with visual processing are adapted for the new skill of echolocation. Studies with blind patients, for example, suggest that the click-echoes heard by these patients were processed by brain regions devoted to vision rather than audition.\n\nReviews of MRI studies on individuals with ADHD suggest that the long-term treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with stimulants, such as amphetamine or methylphenidate, decreases abnormalities in brain structure and function found in subjects with ADHD, and improves function in several parts of the brain, such as the right caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia.\n\nNeuroplasticity is most active in childhood as a part of normal human development, and can also be seen as an especially important mechanism for children in terms of risk and resiliency. Trauma is considered a great risk as it negatively affects many areas of the brain and puts a strain on the sympathetic nervous system from constant activation. Trauma thus alters the brain's connections such that children who have experienced trauma may be hyper vigilant or overly aroused. However a child's brain can cope with these adverse effects through the actions of neuroplasticity.\n\nThere are many examples of neuroplasticity in human development. In an article written by Justine Ker and Stephen Nelson, the effects of musical training on neuroplasticity is looked at. Musical training is a form of experience dependent plasticity. This is when changes in the brain occur based on experiences that are unique to an individual. Examples of this are learning multiple languages, playing a sport, doing theatre, etc. A study done by Hyde in 2009, showed that changes in the brain of children could be seen in as little as 15 months of musical training. Ker and Nelson suggest this degree of plasticity in the brain's of children can \"help provide a form of intervention for children... with developmental disorders and neurological diseases.\"\n\nIn a single lifespan, individuals of an animal species may encounter various changes in brain morphology. Many of these differences are caused by the release of hormones in the brain; others are the product of evolutionary factors or developmental stages. Some changes occur seasonally in species to enhance or generate response behaviors.\n\nChanging brain behavior and morphology to suit other seasonal behaviors is relatively common in animals. These changes can improve the chances of mating during breeding season. Examples of seasonal brain morphology change can be found within many classes and species.\n\nWithin the class Aves, black-capped chickadees experience an increase in the volume of their hippocampus and strength of neural connections to the hippocampus during fall months. These morphological changes within the hippocampus which are related to spatial memory are not limited to birds, as they can also be observed in rodents and amphibians. In songbirds, many song control nuclei in the brain increase in size during mating season. Among birds, changes in brain morphology to influence song patterns, frequency, and volume are common. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) immunoreactivity, or the reception of the hormone, is lowered in European starlings exposed to longer periods of light during the day.\n\nThe California sea hare, a gastropod, has more successful inhibition of egg-laying hormones outside of mating season due to increased effectiveness of inhibitors in the brain. Changes to the inhibitory nature of regions of the brain can also be found in humans and other mammals. In the amphibian Bufo japonicus, part of the amygdala is larger before breeding and during hibernation than it is after breeding.\n\nSeasonal brain variation occurs within many mammals. Part of the hypothalamus of the common ewe is more receptive to GnRH during breeding season than at other times of the year. Humans experience a change in the \"size of the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus and vasopressin-immunoreactive neurons within it\" during the fall, when these parts are larger. In the spring, both reduce in size.\n\nRandy Nudo's group found that if a small stroke (an infarction) is induced by obstruction of blood flow to a portion of a monkey's motor cortex, the part of the body that responds by movement moves when areas adjacent to the damaged brain area are stimulated. In one study, intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) mapping techniques were used in nine normal monkeys. Some underwent ischemic-infarction procedures and the others, ICMS procedures. The monkeys with ischemic infarctions retained more finger flexion during food retrieval and after several months this deficit returned to preoperative levels. With respect to the distal forelimb representation, \"postinfarction mapping procedures revealed that movement representations underwent reorganization throughout the adjacent, undamaged cortex.\" Understanding of interaction between the damaged and undamaged areas provides a basis for better treatment plans in stroke patients. Current research includes the tracking of changes that occur in the motor areas of the cerebral cortex as a result of a stroke. Thus, events that occur in the reorganization process of the brain can be ascertained. Nudo is also involved in studying the treatment plans that may enhance recovery from strokes, such as physiotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and electrical-stimulation therapy.\n\nJon Kaas, a professor at Vanderbilt University, has been able to show \"how somatosensory area 3b and ventroposterior (VP) nucleus of the thalamus are affected by longstanding unilateral dorsal-column lesions at cervical levels in macaque monkeys.\" Adult brains have the ability to change as a result of injury but the extent of the reorganization depends on the extent of the injury. His recent research focuses on the somatosensory system, which involves a sense of the body and its movements using many senses. Usually, damage of the somatosensory cortex results in impairment of the body perception. Kaas' research project is focused on how these systems (somatosensory, cognitive, motor systems) respond with plastic changes resulting from injury.\n\nOne recent study of neuroplasticity involves work done by a team of doctors and researchers at Emory University, specifically Dr. Donald Stein and Dr. David Wright. This is the first treatment in 40 years that has significant results in treating traumatic brain injuries while also incurring no known side effects and being cheap to administer. Dr. Stein noticed that female mice seemed to recover from brain injuries better than male mice, and that at certain points in the estrus cycle, females recovered even better. This difference may be attributed to different levels of progesterone, with higher levels of progesterone leading to the faster recovery from brain injury in mice. However, clinical trials showed progesterone offers no significant benefit for traumatic brain injury human patients.\n\nTranscriptional profiling of the frontal cortex of persons ranging from 26 to 106 years of age defined a set of genes with reduced expression after age 40, and especially after age 70. Genes that play central roles in synaptic plasticity were the most significantly affected by age, generally showing reduced expression over time. There was also a marked increase in cortical DNA damage, likely oxidative DNA damage, in gene promoters with aging.\n\nReactive oxygen species appear to have a significant role in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. However age-related increases in reactive oxygen species may also lead to impairments in these functions.\n\nThe beneficial effect of multilingualism on people's behavior and cognition is well-known nowadays. Numerous studies have shown that people who study more than one language have better cognitive functions and flexibilities than people who only speak one language. Bilinguals are found to have longer attention spans, stronger organization and analyzation skills, and a better theory of mind than monolinguals. Researchers have found that the effect of multilingualism on better cognition is due to neuroplasticity. \n\nIn one prominent study, neurolinguists used a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) method to visualize the structural plasticity of brains in healthy monolinguals and bilinguals. They first investigated the differences in density of grey and white matter between two groups and found the relationship between brain structure and age of language acquisition. The results showed that grey-matter density in the inferior parietal cortex for multilingual individuals were significantly greater than monolingual individuals. The researchers also found that early bilinguals had a greater density of grey matter relative to late bilinguals in the same region. The inferior parietal cortex is a brain region highly associated with the language learning, which corresponds to the VBM result of the study.\n\nRecent studies have also found that learning multiple languages not only re-structures the brain but also boosts brain's capacity for plasticity. A recent study found that multilingualism not only affects the grey matter but also white matter of the brain. White matter is made up of myelinated axons that is greatly associated with learning and communication. Neurolinguists used a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scanning method to determine the white matter intensity between monolinguals and bilinguals. Increased myelinations in white matter tracts were found in bilingual individuals who actively use the both languages in everyday life. The demand of handling more than one language requires more efficient connectivity within the brain and grey matter, which resulted in greater white matter density for multilinguals.\n\nWhile it is still debated whether these changes in brain are result of genetic disposition or environmental demands, many evidences suggest that environmental, social experience in early multilinguals affect the structural and functional reorganization in the brain.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Rombauer (October 30, 1877 – October 14, 1962) was an American cookbook author, best known for \"The Joy of Cooking\" (1931), one of the world's most widely read cookbooks. Following Irma Rombauer's death, periodic revisions of the book were carried out by her daughter, Marion Rombauer Becker, and subsequently by Marion's son Ethan Becker. \"The Joy of Cooking\" remains in print, edited by members of the Rombauer–Becker family, and more than 18 million copies have been sold.\n\nIrma Starkloff was born on October 30, 1877, in St. Louis, Missouri, the younger of two daughters born to Max von Starkloff, a German-born physician, and his second wife, Emma Kuhlmann von Starkloff, a teacher who also hailed from Germany. Her half-brother was Max C. Starkloff, the St. Louis Health Commissioner who introduced social distancing during the 1918 flu pandemic.\n\nIrma's father was active in civic and political affairs; between 1889 and 1894 he served as the United States Consul in Bremen, and during his tenure Irma received some informal education there and in Lausanne, Switzerland. Upon returning to the United States, she took classes in fine arts at Washington University in St. Louis in 1897. She frequently traveled to visit relatives in Indianapolis, where she met and was briefly courted by the young Booth Tarkington. The family opposed the match, however, and in 1899 Irma married Edgar Rombauer, a lawyer whose father was a St. Louis judge who had clerked for Supreme Court Justice John Harlan. The couple's first child, Roland, was born in 1900 but died before his first birthday. The two children who followed lived to adulthood: Marion was born in 1903, and Edgar Jr. (known as \"Put\") was born in 1907.\nDuring the first 30 years of her marriage, Irma Rombauer busied herself with the activities of civic and cultural organizations, and she took pleasure in entertaining, from simple luncheons for members of the women's associations to which she belonged to more formal dinners for civic leaders and political associates of her husband, who became Speaker of the St. Louis House of Delegates. She possessed a sparkling personality that served her well as a hostess. Her biographer wrote, \"No one could be long in her diminutive presence without sensing an air of concentrated intelligence, strength, self-possession, charm, and dignity that seemed to sweep all before it—except that she knew how to soften it with disarming feminine self-deprecation and sheer fun.\" As a cook, she was competent, but not extraordinary, although she showed considerable skill at making and decorating cakes. Her daughter Marion described her priorities:Mother's early housekeeping days...gave little evidence of culinary prowess... Indeed, it is an open secret that Mother, to the very end of her life, regarded social intercourse as more important than food. The dinner table, in our childhood, frequently suggested a lectern rather than a buffet. What I remember better than the dishes it upheld—which, I must admit, constantly improved in quality—was the talk which went 'round it, talk which burst forth out of our richly multiple interests.\n\nThrough much of his adult life, Edgar Rombauer suffered periodic bouts of severe depression. He experienced one of these attacks in the winter of 1929-30 and had seemed to be recovering, but on February 3, 1930, he committed suicide, leaving his wife emotionally shattered and in dire financial straits. The Great Depression had been triggered by the stock market crash just three months earlier, Irma was 52 years old, had no job, and had savings amounting only to $6,000. Her son Put had moved to Florida, and Marion was planning to be married and would soon leave home. It was clear that Irma would need to find something to occupy her mind and provide an income. Her solution was characteristically impulsive and bold. To the bewilderment of many who knew her, she announced that she was going to write a cookbook.\n\nThe earliest origins of the material in \"The Joy of Cooking\" are unclear. Marion considered that it evolved from a collection of recipes supposedly used by her mother as part of a cooking course for the First Unitarian Women's Alliance but later research raises questions about Marion's recollection, with no indication that the mimeographs of the Women's Alliance recipes pre-dated the first edition of \"Joy\". It is certain that Irma solicited from numerous friends and family members many of the recipes that she assembled under the title \"The Joy of Cooking: A Compilation of Reliable Recipes, with a Casual Culinary Chat.\" Marion designed a cover and provided silhouette chapter headings, and 3000 copies of the book were printed by the A. C. Clayton Company, a commercial printer of labels and packaging materials which had never before printed a book. The Saint Louis \"Post Dispatch\" covered the book's 1931 launch with an enthusiastic feature article in which the reviewer remarked, \"It does not insult my intelligence.\" With help from Marion, Irma sold copies personally and had copies placed in bookstores and gift shops throughout St. Louis and as far away as Michigan and Chicago, and by the summer of 1932 roughly two-thirds of the original 3000 copies had been sold.\n\nIt was the \"casual culinary chat\" that provided the book's major selling point. Irma added to the basic recipes bits of humor, friendly advice and homely anecdotes, projecting into the pages the same effervescent personality that had made her so successful as a hostess. A later cookbook author, Molly Finn, summed it up in these words:The best thing about \"The Joy of Cooking\", however, is the voice of its author, Irma Rombauer. She engages in a constant dialogue with her readers, telling stories about herself and her family, sprinkling the text with genuine witticisms and excruciatingly corny puns, and making sure everybody knows that cooking is not an occult science or esoteric art, but part of the everyday work of the vast majority of women (and a few men) that can be turned into fun with her help.\n\nThe success of the initial \"Joy\" encouraged Irma to seek an established publisher for an expanded edition. For several years her inquiries brought only rejection letters; but in 1935 her manuscript was accepted (on the third submission) by the Bobbs-Merrill Company, an Indianapolis-based firm specializing in legal publications, children's literature, and trade books. They had limited experience with cookbooks, and Irma knew nothing about dealing with publishers. She represented herself in the negotiations, without help from an agent or a lawyer, and the resulting contract was highly prejudicial to her interests, planting the seeds for an author-publisher relationship that brought misery and rage to both sides, up to and beyond the end of Irma's life. However, Bobbs-Merrill mounted a vigorous sales campaign on behalf of \"Joy\", and the 1936 edition sold 6,838 copies within six months, on its way to an edition total of 52,151.\n\nThe 1936 edition retained the author's anecdotes and witty comments (at Irma's insistence, despite Bobbs-Merrill's desire to cut them), and it added a new selling point in the format of its recipes. Traditionally recipes begin with a list of ingredients, after which come the preparation instructions. The 1936 \"Joy\" pioneered a different layout, in which the directions unfolded as a narrative, with ingredients being listed (indented and in boldface type) as the need for them arose. This \"action format\" reinforced the chatty \"Irmaisms\" to suggest that the recipes were really just conversations between the author and the book's user.\n\nIn 1939, Irma published \"Streamlined Cooking\", featuring dishes that could be created in less than 30 minutes. The target audience included working women, students, vacationers and campers, and, indeed, men pressed into a domestic version of KP duty. For this population, speed and ease of preparation overrode other considerations, and the book's recipes made generous use of canned, packaged and frozen ingredients. While the book was not a commercial success, a number of its recipes found their way into the phenomenally successful 1943 edition of \"Joy\".\n\nThe 1943 edition boasted no innovation as revolutionary as the \"action method\" format introduced in 1936, but in addition to the recipes from \"Streamlined\" it included material on \"herbs, nutritional tallies for common foods, cooking terms, table settings, and the serving of wines\" and provided suggestions for dealing with wartime rationing, including alternatives to butter in some recipes. Also, the book's friendly, reassuring tone provided a form of relief to readers buffeted by \"the hot and cold conflicts which raged outside its cozy covers...especially the 'War Bride'\". The resulting edition, aggressively marketed by Bobbs-Merrill, became a national best-seller. Between 1943 and 1946, \"Joy\" sold 617,782 copies, far surpassing sales of its principal rival, Fannie Farmer's \"Boston Cooking-School Cook Book\". A 1946 reprint of the same edition deleted the material on rationing (substituting more recipes from \"Streamlined\") but was otherwise nearly identical. Also appearing in 1946 was an entirely new title: a children's cookbook written by Irma called \"A Cookbook for Girls and Boys\".\n\nBy the mid-1940s Irma had become a national celebrity, a status in which she delighted. She also had more than enough income, and was able to provide some financial assistance to her children, and to pay more generously the secretary who had faithfully typed all of her manuscripts, Mazie Whyte Hartrich. But by the time the 1946 edition was printed, Irma was nearing 70, and her health was beginning to decline. A series of family crises and tragedies compounded the perpetual warfare with Bobbs-Merrill to leave Irma feeling weakened and concerned about the future of \"Joy\". Deciding that she would need a collaborator for the next edition, and hoping that the book would remain a family project, she asked her daughter Marion to help her with the next version of the text, and she negotiated a clause in her contract with Bobbs-Merrill specifying that Marion was to have sole authority to complete future revisions of \"Joy\" in the event of Irma's disability or death.\n\nRombauer's daughter Marion initially worked primarily on the artistic design of the upcoming revision, but by 1949 she had become deeply involved in the negotiations with Bobbs-Merrill. She had no better luck dealing with the publisher than had her mother, and as author-publisher relations sank to a new low (involving legal threats), Marion assumed responsibility as co-author. The revised edition appeared in 1951 (with subsequent printings in 1952 and 1953 correcting errors and improving the index). It was both a critical and commercial success: in 1952 alone 201,394 copies were sold.\n\nFollowing the publication of the 1951 edition of \"Joy\", Rombauer was able to enjoy her status as \"one of the eternal verities of American cooking\". She and her daughter made frequent trips to New York where they were welcomed by a circle which included food writers Cecily Brownstone and Jane Nickerson, and chefs James Beard, Marian Tracy, and Helmut Rippenger. Rombauer undertook a tour of Europe with Mark Becker, her grandson, during which she met Julia Child, a faithful fan of \"Joy\".\n\nAlthough Rombauer suffered some digestive disorders and tired easily, her health at this time was good for a woman now in her mid-seventies. Rombauer had started work on a history of her life when she suffered a stroke on May 26, 1955. While she quickly regained most of her physical and mental abilities, it was followed the next year by a more severe stroke, which caused progressive physical degeneration, and also resulted in extreme irritability, causing her to periodically lash out at those with whom she interacted, particularly Marion (who was herself recovering from a mastectomy). Rombauer's health continued to deteriorate during the next few years. By 1962 she was suffering a series of seizures, her left leg had become paralyzed and eventually had to be amputated.\n\nOn October 14, 1899, Rombauer married Edgar Roderich Rombauer. They had three children, Roland Rombauer (1900–1901), Marion J. Rombauer (1903–1976), and Edgar H. Rombauer Jr (born 1907).\nRombauer's daughter Marion J. Rombauer's husband is John Becker, an architect. Rombauer's daughter is also the illustrator and co-author of \"The Joy of Cooking\".\n\nOn October 14, 1962, Rombauer died in St. Louis, Missouri. She was 84 years old. Rombauer was cremated and her ashes were buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nOn February 23, 1956 Irma Rombauer received a Founder's Day Award from Washington University, where she had attended classes in 1897, although she did not complete a degree program.\n\nIn 1998, Irma Rombauer was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame.\n\nRombauer was portrayed by Frances Sternhagen in the 2009 film \"Julie & Julia\".\n\n"}

When publisher Gilbert Dalziel re-launched the cartoon as \"Ally Sloper's Half Holiday\", in 1884, Sloper was illustrated by William Baxter until his death in 1888. He was succeeded by W. Fletcher Thomas, who continued the illustrations until approximately 1899, when the publisher invited C. H.

Fields and Charlie Chaplin's \"little tramp\" character and its imitators.\n\nThe arrival of the First World War in 1914 saw severe paper rationing, and in 1916 the \"Half Holiday\" comic ceased production. Attempts after the war to revive Sloper proved short-lived, as Sloper was a somewhat stereotypical Victorian and Edwardian type, and did not fit into the new post-war world.\n\n\n"}

The river is about long. At times, it is also called Grand Cascapédia River to differentiate it from the Little Cascapédia River which empties into the same bay just to the east.\n\nThe Cascapedia is known for its Atlantic salmon (\"salmo salar\") fishing. With average catches of and a record catch of , caught in 1886, the river has long been recognized as one of Quebec's richest salmon rivers. Already back in 1835, surveyor Joseph Hamel noted the abundance of fish, including trout, salmon, carp, and whitefish. Several Governors General of Canada, including The Marquess of Lansdowne and Lord Stanley, had summer homes along this river.\n\nThe river is accessible via Quebec Route 299 that follows the river's course for . Almost its entire course is protected in the Cascapedia River Wildlife Reserve (\"réserve faunique de la Rivière-Cascapédia\"), established in 1982. Its headwaters and Lake Cascapedia are within the Gaspésie National Park.\n\nIts name comes from the Mi'kmaq word \"gesgapegiag\", meaning \"strong current\" or \"large river\". It was first documented on a map by Jean-Baptiste-Louis Franquelin in 1686 as \"Kichkabeguiak\", and appeared as \"Kaskabijack\" on a map of 1783.

The lack of agriculture and industry keep the river free from pollution. Its water is rated of the highest quality.\n\nThe Cascapedia basin is also mostly undeveloped with less than under cultivation.

{"id": "1948695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1948695", "title": "Regenerative cooling (rocket)", "text": "Regenerative cooling (rocket)\n\nRegenerative cooling, in the context of rocket engine design, is a configuration in which some or all of the propellant is passed through tubes, channels, or in a jacket around the combustion chamber or nozzle to cool the engine. This is effective because the fuel (and sometimes the oxidizer) are good coolants. The heated propellant is then fed into a special gas generator or injected directly into the main combustion chamber.\n\nIn 1857 Carl Wilhelm Siemens introduced the concept of regenerative cooling. On 10 May 1898, James Dewar used regenerative cooling to become the first to statically liquefy hydrogen.\nThe concept of regenerative cooling was also mentioned in 1903 in an article by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. Robert Goddard built the first regeneratively cooled engine in 1923, but rejected the scheme as too complex. A regeneratively cooled engine was built by the Italian researcher, Gaetano Arturo Crocco in 1930. The first Soviet engines to employ the technique were Fridrikh Tsander's OR-2 tested in March 1933 and the ORM-50, bench tested in November 1933 by Valentin Glushko. The first German engine of this type was also tested in March 1933 by Klaus Riedel in the VfR. The Austrian scientist Eugen Sänger was particularly famous for experiments with engine cooling starting in 1933; however, most of his experimental engines were water-cooled or cooled by an extra circuit of propellant.\n\nThe V-2 rocket engine, the most powerful of its time at 25 tons (245 kN) of thrust, was regeneratively cooled, in a design by Walter Thiel, by fuel lines coiled around the outside of the combustion chamber. This was an inefficient design that required the burning of diluted alcohol at low chamber pressure to avoid melting the engine. The American Redstone engine used the same design.\n\nA key innovation in regenerative cooling was the Soviet U-1250 engine designed by Aleksei Mihailovich Isaev in 1945. Its combustion chamber was lined with a thin copper sheet supported by the corrugated steel wall of the chamber. Fuel flowed through the corrugations and absorbed heat very efficiently. This permitted more energetic fuels and higher chamber pressures, and it is the basic plan used in all Russian engines since. Modern American engines solve this problem by lining the combustion chamber with brazed copper or nickel alloy tubes (although recent engines like in the RS-68 have started to use the Russian technique which is cheaper to construct). The American style of lining the engine with copper tubes is called the \"spaghetti construction\", and the concept is credited to Edward A. Neu at Reaction Motors Inc. in 1947.\n\nThe heat flux through the chamber wall is very high; 1-20 MW/m is not uncommon.\n\nThe amount of heat that can flow into the coolant is controlled by many factors including the temperature difference between the chamber and the coolant, the heat transfer coefficient, the thermal conductivity of the chamber wall, the velocity in the coolant channels and the velocity of the gas flow in the chamber or the nozzle.\n\nTwo boundary layers form: one in the hot gas in the chamber and the other in the coolant within the channels.\n\nVery typically most of the temperature drop occurs in the gas boundary layer since gases are relatively poor conductors. This boundary layer can be destroyed however by combustion instabilities, and wall failure can follow very soon afterwards.\n\nThe boundary layer within the coolant channels can also be disrupted if the coolant is at subcritical pressure and film boils; the gas then forms an insulating layer and the wall temperature climbs very rapidly and soon fails. However, if the coolant engages in nucleate boiling but does not form a film, this helps disrupt the coolant boundary layer and the gas bubbles formed rapidly collapse; this can triple the maximum heat flow. However, many modern engines with turbopumps use supercritical coolants, and these techniques can be seldom used.\n\nRegenerative cooling is seldom used in isolation; film cooling, curtain cooling, transpiration cooling, radiation cooling are frequently employed as well.\n\nWith regenerative cooling, the pressure in the cooling channels is greater than the chamber pressure. The inner liner is under compression, while the outer wall of the engine is under significant hoop stresses.\n\nThe metal of the inner liner is greatly weakened by the high temperature, and also undergoes significant thermal expansion at the inner surface while the cold-side wall of the liner constrains the expansion. This sets up significant thermal stresses that can cause the inner surface to crack or craze after multiple firings particularly at the throat.\n\nIn addition the thin inner liner requires mechanical support to withstand the compressive loading due to the propellant's pressure; this support is usually provided by the side walls of the cooling channels and the backing plate.\n\nThe inner liner is usually constructed of relatively high temperature, high thermal conductivity materials; traditionally copper or nickel based alloys have been used.\n\nSeveral different manufacturing techniques can be used to create the complex geometry necessary for regenerative cooling. These include a corrugated metal sheet brazed between the inner and outer liner; hundreds of pipes brazed into the correct shape, or an inner liner with milled cooling channels and an outer liner around that. \nThe geometry can also be created through direct metal 3D printing, as seen on some newer designs such as the SpaceX SuperDraco rocket engine.\n\n"}

It lies within the historic Staffordshire Hundred of Totmonslow: for administrative purposes, it is now part of the Staffordshire Moorlands area.\n\nCheadle appears in the Domesday Book as \"Celle\" held by the lord of the manor, Robert of Stafford, at the time the area covered 6 miles by 3 miles and listed 9 families. In 1176 the Basset family acquired the manor of \"Chedle\" and in 1250 Ralph Basset was granted a market charter and annual fair by King Henry III.\nIn 1309, 75 families are recorded as using a corn-grinding mill sited near Mill Road. Fifty years later, a new church was built in the village replacing a 12th-century structure and this church remained in use until 1837.\n\nIn 1606 a school was founded by the church, and in 1685 the then curate of the parish, Rev, Henry Stubbs, left an endowment to found a grammar school in Cheadle. The school was built at Monkhouse (behind the High Street) and was active until 1917. The endowment continues to this day. The Monkhouse is currently home to 3rd Cheadle Scout Group.\n\nBy 1676 Cheadle’s population is recorded as just over one thousand, and a hundred years later (1772) as one thousand eight hundred. At this time the main source of employment was agriculture and farming. During the same period a new workhouse was built and opened. It was extended under the Cheadle Union an 1837. Part of the original building was demolished in 1909, renamed an infirmary. The whole complex was demolished in 1987 and a new hospital was built on the site, which was opened in 1989 by Princess Anne.\n\nIn 1798, 10 weavers houses were built. The weavers lived downstairs and the looms for the manufacture of tape were upstairs. By the 1820s the looms were transferred into a factory in Tape Street. This tape factory closed in 1972, and is now a shop. In 1851 silk and narrow fabric mills were built in Cheadle. They employed hundreds of operatives, and closed in 1981.\n\nIn the Brookhouses area of Cheadle in 1725, the Cheadle Brass and Copper Company started production, transferring to the Oakamoor area 100 years later under the company name Thomas Patten. It was bought in 1851 by Thomas Bolton of Birmingham. In 1890 Bolton’s opened a factory at Froghall and the Oakamoor works were eventually closed in 1963.\n\nSt Giles' Catholic Church opened in 1846. Its spire still dominates the town today. It was built by Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin, who was commissioned by John Talbot, 16th Earl of Shrewsbury to create a church that \"would have no rival\". To achieve his aim, Talbot gave Pugin unlimited resources with which to build it. The church is more commonly known as 'Pugin's Gem', and is the centre of a local tourist event known as 'Discover the Secret'.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century the first open air swimming baths were constructed at Brookhouses, and telephone installation began in 1904. In 1901 Cheadle was linked to the railway network by the Cheadle Railway, operated and later owned by the North Staffordshire Railway, with the building of a railway station at Majors Barn, giving access to further industries and movement of passengers. At a later period sand, gravel and aggregates used for building purposes were transported from the station as well as coal.\n\nThe first motor car arrived in Cheadle in 1903, and the first licensed omnibus service – Cheadle to Longton – commenced in January 1914.\n\nOne of the British Signals Intelligence Y-stations called RAF Cheadle was situated at Woodhead Hall, from land purchased by the Air Ministry playing a vital role in helping intercept German Luftwaffe radio communications during the Second World War.\n\nThe spire of St. Giles' Catholic Church dominates Cheadle's skyline. Known as \"Pugin's Gem\", it is considered to be the most complete expression of Pugin's beliefs about what a church ought to be, with everything in it having a practical and symbolic purpose. The church featured heavily in local events celebrating the 200th anniversary of the birth of Pugin.\n\nThe town also has an Anglican church dedicated to St Giles. It was totally rebuilt in 1837–39 to the design of J. P. Pritchett, but incorporating fragments and furniture from the earlier church. There is also a strong Methodist tradition in Cheadle, and in the 19th century it was the various Methodist chapels around the Cheadle area which taught many of the young boys who worked on the farms or in the coal mines to read and write. There is a large modern Methodist church in the town.\n\nTo the south-east of Cheadle are the remains of Croxden Abbey, founded in 1176 by Bertram de Verdun for monks of the Cistercian Order. The abbey is a 5-mile walk from the town centre.\nCheadle is a base for exploring the Peak District National Park area, which is popular with walkers and rock climbers. Surrounded by lofty hills, Cheadle is the gateway to the wooded Churnet Valley and the Staffordshire Moorlands. It is also around from the Alton Towers Resort.\n\nCecilly Brook Local Nature Reserve is near the centre of town. It is one of the most important breeding sites for water voles in Staffordshire. There are 42 acres of landscaped lakes at the JCB factory. Local leisure facilities are at Cheadle Recreation Ground and South Moorlands Leisure Centre.\n\nThe High Street of Cheadle has many old buildings and is little changed from how it looked in the Victorian era.\n\nCheadle was mentioned in the Domesday Book as a small and unimportant hamlet with a small population. The town grew steadily over the next few hundred years, with the development of industry and agriculture. The historic industries that the town has depended on have been coal mining, silk, agriculture, brass making and the historic copper industry in nearby Froghall and Oakamoor. The town and the nearby village of Tean, Staffordshire also had a textiles industry in tape weaving - the mill has since been converted into flats.\n\nFor hundreds of years the main industry in the Cheadle area was coal mining. The Cheadle Coalfield was part of the much larger North Staffordshire Coalfield. The town and the surrounding area were once home to over sixty mines, but the Industry declined in the 20th century, and one by one the remaining larger pits were closed; Parkhall (now the home to the JCB factories) and Hazlewall in the 1930s, New Haden in 1943 and Foxfield in 1965. However opencast mining and small scale adit mining carried on in Cheadle up until the 1990s.\n\nToday the town's main employer is the large JCB factories. There are also several small industrial units on the site of the former New Haden Colliery and the local Alton Towers Resort employs many of its work force from the Cheadle area. A lot of people in the town commute to Stoke-on-Trent, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Uttoxeter and Derby.\n\nMarkets are held in the market place on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.\n\n\"The Cheadle and Tean Times\" has been publishing newspapers weekly in the town since 1896. The only family run and independent newspaper in North Staffordshire, it is also fondly known by townsfolk as 'the Stunner.'\n\nThe weekly \"Cheadle Post & Times\" and the daily \"Sentinel\" newspapers also cover the town. Local radio stations are Signal 1 and Signal 2 from Stoke-on-Trent and BBC Radio Stoke. Community station Moorlands Radio covers the town from Leek.\n\nCheadle High School also operates an internet radio station for the local area, which has shows presented and produced by the high school radio. \n\nCheadle used to be served by a branch line opened in 1901 from Cresswell which was a station on the North Staffordshire Railway Crewe to Derby Line. It took almost thirty years of petitioning by the local coalmasters and notables in the town for the Cheadle Railway Company to build the small branch line and station. Even though the branch was only about four miles (6 km) long it was difficult to build as a tunnel had to be constructed under the huge Bunter Sandstone Hill at Huntley. The tunnel was very wet and plagued by problems with its roof. In the 1930s the LMS Railway, which had taken over the North Staffordshire Railway, built a diversion line around Huntley tunnel and abandoned it. The tunnel survives because it was used as a coal mine in the '70s and '80s, and the southern portal remains; however the northern portal has long been filled in. \nWith the opening of the branch line to Cheadle it meant that New Haden Colliery and Parkhall Colliery now had connections to the rail network, and Cheadle in general had its long-awaited rail connection to the outside world. The line closed to passenger traffic in 1963 but remained open to serve local gravel quarries until 1982.\n\nToday, the nearest railway station is Blythe Bridge on the Crewe-Derby Line.\n\nBus services to Cheadle were provided by PMT until it was bought out by First Group, now operating under the name First PMT. Such service include bus number '32 Hanley – Uttoxeter', every twenty minutes and '32A Hanley – Uttoxeter via Alton Towers', every two hours (one hour during the summer).\n\nJST run a 123 service that circles Cheadle and its various estates.\n\nWardles run the 235 route between Cheadle and Leek.\n\nPhil Smith Travel runs the 185, a service between Hollington and Cheadle on Fridays only.\n\nWardles also now run a X51 bus service to Hanley via Blythe, Meir and Stoke-on-Trent railway station.

In 2016 it was succeeded by the War Studies University.\n\nThe National Defence University in Warsaw was established on 1 October 1990 after reform of the General Staff Academy (est. 1947) and continued traditions of the Szkoła Rycerska (\"The School of Knights\") founded on 15 March 1765 and other subsequent military schools. The National Defence University was subordinate directly to the Polish Ministry of National Education. AON was the alma mater of Polish commanding and staff officers and civilian experts in national and international security matters. It also conducted extensive scientific research on state defence issues, military doctrine, theory of warfare, military art, including military strategy, operational art and tactics, also in the field of national and international security. The National Defence University in Warsaw cooperated with the Polish Ministry of National Defence, General Staff, North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other Polish and foreign military, scientific and academic institutions.\n\nThe school's master's program was a five-years study program, but also AON provided two-years under- and over graduate study programs and four-years PhD (Doctor of Science) programs and higher doctorate (habilitation) opportunity as well.\n\nThe present National Defence University inherits the traditions of all previous Polish military academies. The first such school, the Szkoła Rycerska, was founded in 1765 by King Stanisław August Poniatowski. Its graduates included some of the most notable military men of the 18th and 19th centuries, including Tadeusz Kościuszko, Jakub Jasiński, Maurycy Hauke, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, Karol Kniaziewicz, Józef Sowiński, Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha and Rajmund Rembieliński.\n\nIn 1794, after the Partitions of Poland, the school was closed. However, after 1815 the recreation of the Kingdom of Poland allowed for opening several military colleges in Poland. The most notable, \"Szkoła Aplikacyjna Artylerii i Inżynierii\" (Artillery and Engineers School), was located in Warsaw and trained cadres of the Polish Army that fought in the November 1830 Uprising against Russia. Only some 24 officers were admitted each year, making its graduates an elite of the Polish armed forces. The instructor in French language was Mikołaj Chopin, father of renowned composer Fryderyk Chopin. After the November Uprising, the school was closed by Russian authorities. However, military training of Polish officers continued in foreign schools, most notably in France and Italy.\n\nAfter the rebirth of Poland in 1918, there was already a well-trained and experienced cadre of Polish field officers trained in the armies of the partitioners (Russia, Germany and Austria-Hungary) as well as in France. However, the occupants of Poland rarely promoted the Poles to higher ranks and the reborn Polish Army was seriously lacking officers trained in general staff duties and in command of entire armies. To eliminate the problem, in cooperation with the French Military Mission to Poland and the Paris-based Ecole Superieure de Guerre, a Szkoła Wojenna Sztabu Generalnego (\"War School of the General Staff\") was formed in mid-1919.\n\nAfter the Polish-Bolshevik War, on August 16, 1922, the school was renamed to Wyższa Szkoła Wojenna (WSW, \"Higher War School\"). Until 1928, most professors were French, with Polish officers serving mostly as their assistants. Among them was Charles de Gaulle, the future president of France, who was a professor of tactics. The training was not limited to military affairs and among the civilians working there were some of the most notable scientists of the era, including Tadeusz Kotarbiński, Edward Lipiński and Marian Kukiel. Apart from the theoreticians, the professors included a large number of officers who gained combat experience in World War I, Polish-Bolshevik War, Polish-Ukrainian War and Polish-Lithuanian War, as well as the Greater Poland Uprising and Silesian Uprisings. Because of their experience, the school became prestigious and attracted many students from abroad, most notably from France, Georgia, Estonia, Latvia and even Japan. Among them were also the officers of the former Ukrainian army of Semen Petlura and White Russian emigrees.\n\nDuring the 20 years of its existence, the Wyższa Szkoła Wojenna trained more than 1300 officers of the Polish Army. Most of them repaid the debt for Poland during the Polish Defensive War of 1939, while the majority of professors formed the staff of Poznań Army, the most successful of Polish Armies in the 1939 campaign.\n\nAfter Poland was overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union, the school was closed. However, on November 11, 1940, it was recreated in London. It trained the officers of the Polish Army in Exile, fighting alongside the Allies on all fronts of World War II. The professors were recruited from among the active officers of the Polish HQ and the students included many of the notable generals of the Polish forces in Exile. In addition, the school was the alma mater of all highest-ranking Czechoslovak officers of the exiled army. It was closed in 1946, after the Allies withdrew their support for the Polish government.\n\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted the activities of War College only for several months. Order of the Supreme Commander of 11 November 1940, resumed its activities initially in London (United Kingdom) and later in Scotland. To the War College in Exile were appointed officers - in ranks of lieutenants and captains. Students were also the Czechoslovak army officers. The purpose of education was to prepare personnel to serve in the brigade and division staffs of the Polish Armed Forces in the West. The program and methods of education were similar to those from the period War College in Warsaw. School received establishment to the exercises, instructions and other normative documents from the British armed forces, allowing joint operations. School staff were officers of the Polish Commander of Staff. The activities of the War College in Exile was halted in July 1946. After the World War II, traditions of higher military education were continued in the Poland.\n\nIn 1947 a General Staff Academy was created. Its graduates have included Zygmunt Zieliński, Bolesław Chocha, Antoni Jasiński and Wojciech Jaruzelski.\n\n\nStudies for officers:\n\nSecond degree studies (leading to a master's degree) in the following areas:\nPostgraduate studies and advanced courses:\n\nStudies for civilians:\n\nFull-time and part-time first degree studies (leading to a bachelor's degree) and second degree studies (leading to a master's degree) in the following areas:\nPostgraduate studies in the field of:\n\n\n"}

It was an early British armour-piercing artillery projectile, intended to pierce the armour protection of warships being developed in the second half of the 19th century.\n\nMajor Palliser's shot, approved 21 October 1867, was an improvement over the ordinary elongated shot of the time. It was adopted for the larger types of rifled muzzle-loading guns rifled on the Woolwich principle (with three rifling grooves). Palliser shot in many calibers stayed in service in the armour-piercing role until phased out of (British) service in 1909 for naval and fortress use, and 1921 for land service.\n\nPalliser shot was made of cast iron, the head being chilled in casting to harden it, using composite molds with a metal, water-cooled portion for the head. At times there were defects that led to cracking in the projectiles, but these were overcome with time. Bronze studs were installed into the outside of the projectile so as to engage the rifling grooves in the gun barrel. The base had a hollow pocket but was not filled with powder or explosive: the cavity was necessitated by difficulties in casting large solid projectiles without their cracking when they cooled, because the nose and base of the projectiles cooled at different rates, and in fact a larger cavity facilitated a better-quality casting. The hole at the base was threaded to accept a copper gas check. This prevented propellant gases from blowing around the projectile, providing obturation as the driving band had yet to be perfected. Later designs did away with the studs on the projectile body, with the gas checks being set with grooves to impart spin to the projectile. \n\nAt the Battle of Angamos (8 October 1879) the Chilean ironclad warships fired twenty 250-pound Palliser gunshots against the Peruvian monitor \"Huáscar\", with devastating results. It was the first time that such piercing shells were used in actual combat.\n\nBritain also deployed Palliser shells in the 1870s–1880s. In the shell the cavity was slightly larger than in the shot and was filled with gunpowder instead of being empty, to provide a small explosive effect after penetrating armour plating. The shell was correspondingly slightly longer than the shot to compensate for the lighter cavity. The powder filling was ignited by the shock of impact and hence did not require a fuze. While these Palliser shells were effective against unhardened iron, British doctrine held that only shot (i.e. non-explosive projectiles) were suitable for penetrating the new hardened armour being developed in the 1880s; hence the gunpowder filling was discontinued.\n\n"}

The film was the last film directed by Howard Hawks, from a script by Leigh Brackett. The film was shot in Technicolor with a running time of 114 minutes. The musical score was composed by Jerry Goldsmith and the movie was filmed at Cuernavaca in the Mexican state of Morelos and at Tucson, Arizona.\n\nIt was the third Howard Hawks film varying the idea of a sheriff defending his office against belligerent outlaw elements in the town, after \"Rio Bravo\" (1959) and \"El Dorado\" (1966), both also starring John Wayne.\n\nDuring the final days of the American Civil War, the Union army payroll train is hijacked by Confederates led by Capt. Pierre Cordona and Sgt. Tuscarora Phillips. Their scheme suggests that the Confederates must have gotten detailed inside information about the transport. Col. Cord McNally’s close friend, Lt. Ned Forsythe, is fatally injured in the raid, and during the pursuit McNally’s squad is spread thinner and thinner until he is left on his own. After Cordona and his men capture him, McNally tricks them by leading them into a Union camp and raising the alarm. Cordona and Tuscarora are captured, but will not reveal to McNally the identity of the traitor who sold them the information about the train.\n\nDespite this development, the three men gain a mutual respect for each other, and after the war ends, McNally visits Cordona and Phillips as they are being released. He asks them once more about the traitors, but all they can provide is a physical description. McNally then tells Cordona and Tuscarora that if they should come across these men again, to contact him through a friend of his, Pat Cronin, who is the sheriff of Blackthorne in Texas. \n\nSometime later, McNally is contacted by Pat on instructions from Cordona, who is staying at the local hotel. When he arrives in Blackthorne, he meets a young woman, Shasta Delaney, who has come to report the murder of her employer by a deputy of Rio Lobo's sheriff, \"Blue Tom\" Hendricks. Shortly afterwards a posse from Rio Lobo arrives and wants to take Delaney away. Delaney identifies their leader, \"Whitey\" Carter, as the murderer she was referring to. When one of the posse aims a gun at Cronin, Delaney shoots Whitey from under the table, resulting in a shoot-out in which McNally, Cronin and Cordona finish off the posse.\n\nCordona, who identifies Whitey as one of the traitors McNally is looking for, tells him that Tuscarora had contacted him and told him that Phillips' father and other ranchers are being bullied by a man named Ketcham, who installed Hendricks as his sheriff after he killed the previous incumbent. McNally, Cordona, and Delaney go to Rio Lobo, where they find the people living in terror of Hendricks and his men. Hendricks has Tuscarora arrested on trumped-up charges, so McNally's group goes to get help from Tuscarora's father, Old Man Philips. McNally, Cordona, and Philips sneak into Ketcham's ranch and take him as a hostage, and McNally discovers that Ketcham is really Union Sergeant Major Ike Gorman, the second traitor he was searching for.\n\nMcNally forces Ketcham to sign the title deeds of the ranches back to their rightful owners, then the men retreat to Rio Lobo, where they order Hendricks and his men to vacate the town jail. They take over the building for cover, freeing Tuscarora, while Cordona goes for the cavalry. Meanwhile, Tuscarora's girlfriend Maria Carmen and her friend, Amelita, lend assistance. For that, Hendricks slashes Amelita's face, and Amelita swears to McNally that she will kill Hendricks.\n\nKetcham's men capture Cordona and offer to trade him for Ketcham. In the meantime, several ranchers turn up to help, knowing that, if McNally fails, the town will have gained nothing from the returned deeds. During the prisoner exchange, Cordona manages to give his captors the slip. McNally yells out that Ketcham is now bankrupt, having signed the deeds back, so the furious sheriff guns Ketcham down, and in turn McNally shoots Hendricks in the leg. McNally then gets shot in his own leg and is dragged back into the cantina where his group is entrenched.\n\nAfter a failed attempt to blow up the cantina, the remaining bandits are outflanked by the rest of the townspeople, who have rallied to help. Hendrick's men realize that all is lost, and they flee. Hendricks shoots at them, but he has been using his rifle as a crutch and, with its muzzle clogged with dust, it explodes in his face. As he stumbles to his horse, Amelita guns him down, thus keeping her promise and ridding the town of its final menace.\n\nThe film was meant to be shot in Durango, Mexico on a budget of $5 million. However shooting on the movie \"Lawman\" took up facilities there so Hawks and Cinema Center had to spend an extra $1 million to allow shooting at Old Tucson Studios, and near Los Angeles.\n\nHawks was injured while filming the railway scene, requiring four stitches.\n\nHawks said he had to fight Cinema Center to cast Chris Mitchum in the movie.\n\nThe script was rewritten throughout production.\n\nThe film made $4.25 million (USD) in rentals, twentieth among the highest money-making pictures of the year, but it grossed $2 million less than its $6 million budget, making it a box office bomb.\n\nUpon release, the film received mostly negative reviews. \"Variety\" wrote that \"Hawks' direction is as listless as the plot\". Roger Ebert, who gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, wrote, \"\"Rio Lobo\" is just a shade tired, especially after the finely honed humor and action of \"El Dorado\".\" Roger Greenspun of \"The New York Times\" said that the film was \"close enough to greatness to stand above everything else so far in the current season.\" His comments surprised other critics and resulted in numerous angry letters sent to the newspaper. \n\nIn a retrospective review, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote, \"The fact that its best action sequence, the first, was directed by the second unit is emblematic of Hawks's relative lack of engagement with the material.\" \"TV Guide\" wrote, \"for such a refined director as Hawks to end his career on a note like this, having made some of the finest films in the history of American cinema, is an atrocity not worth the silver used in the negative.\" Writing for \"Time Out\", Geoff Andrew said, \"If it lacks the formal perfection of \"Rio Bravo\" and the moving elegy for men grown old of \"El Dorado\", it's still a marvellous film\". \"Empire\" writer Ian Nathan wrote in January 2000, \"this well-bred Western is just a routine canter through themes and gunfights as worn as the saddles.\" Quentin Tarantino cited \"Rio Lobo\" as one of the reasons he wanted to have a short directing career: \"the most cutting-edge artist, the coolest guys, the hippest dudes, they’re the ones that stay at the party too long. They’re the ones that make those last two or three movies that are completely out of touch and do not realize the world has turned on them [...] I don’t want to make \"Rio Lobo\".\"\n\nThe music for \"Rio Lobo\" was composed by Jerry Goldsmith. The soundtrack album was released in Belgium in 2001 on Prometheus Records.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1948728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1948728", "title": "Aconitase", "text": "Aconitase\n\nAconitase (aconitate hydratase; ) is an enzyme that catalyses the stereo-specific isomerization of citrate to isocitrate via \"cis\"-aconitate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, a non-redox-active process.\n\nAconitase, displayed in the structures in the right margin of this page, has two slightly different structures, depending on whether it is activated or inactivated. In the inactive form, its structure is divided into four domains. Counting from the N-terminus, only the first three of these domains are involved in close interactions with the [3Fe-4S] cluster, but the active site consists of residues from all four domains, including the larger C-terminal domain. The Fe-S cluster and a SO anion also reside in the active site. When the enzyme is activated, it gains an additional iron atom, creating a [4Fe-4S] cluster. However, the structure of the rest of the enzyme is nearly unchanged; the conserved atoms between the two forms are in essentially the same positions, up to a difference of 0.1 angstroms.\n\nIn contrast with the majority of iron-sulfur proteins that function as electron carriers, the iron-sulfur cluster of aconitase reacts directly with an enzyme substrate. Aconitase has an active [FeS] cluster, which may convert to an inactive [FeS] form. Three cysteine (Cys) residues have been shown to be ligands of the [FeS] centre. In the active state, the labile iron ion of the [FeS] cluster is not coordinated by Cys but by water molecules.\n\nThe iron-responsive element-binding protein (IRE-BP) and 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase (α-isopropylmalate isomerase; ), an enzyme catalysing the second step in the biosynthesis of leucine, are known aconitase homologues. Iron regulatory elements (IREs) constitute a family of 28-nucleotide, non-coding, stem-loop structures that regulate iron storage, heme synthesis and iron uptake. They also participate in ribosome binding and control the mRNA turnover (degradation). The specific regulator protein, the IRE-BP, binds to IREs in both 5' and 3' regions, but only to RNA in the apo form, without the Fe-S cluster. Expression of IRE-BP in cultured cells has revealed that the protein functions either as an active aconitase, when cells are iron-replete, or as an active RNA-binding protein, when cells are iron-depleted. Mutant IRE-BPs, in which any or all of the three Cys residues involved in Fe-S formation are replaced by serine, have no aconitase activity, but retain RNA-binding properties.\n\nAconitase is inhibited by fluoroacetate, therefore fluoroacetate is poisonous. Fluoroacetate, in the citric acid cycle, can innocently enter as fluorocitrate. However, aconitase cannot bind this substrate and thus the citric acid cycle is halted. The iron sulfur cluster is highly sensitive to oxidation by superoxide.\n\nAconitase employs a dehydration-hydration mechanism. The catalytic residues involved are His-101 and Ser-642. His-101 protonates the hydroxyl group on C3 of citrate, allowing it to leave as water, and Ser-642 concurrently abstracts the proton on C2, forming a double bond between C2 and C3, forming a \"cis\"-aconitate intermediate. At this point, the intermediate is rotated 180°. This rotation is referred to as a \"flip.\" Because of this flip, the intermediate is said to move from a \"citrate mode\" to a \"isocitrate mode.\"\n\nHow exactly this flip occurs is debatable. One theory is that, in the rate-limiting step of the mechanism, the \"cis\"-aconitate is released from the enzyme, then reattached in the isocitrate mode to complete the reaction. This rate-limiting step ensures that the right stereochemistry, specifically (2R,3S), is formed in the final product. Another hypothesis is that \"cis\"-aconitate stays bound to the enzyme while it flips from the citrate to the isocitrate mode.\n\nIn either case, flipping \"cis\"-aconitate allows the dehydration and hydration steps to occur on opposite faces of the intermediate. Aconitase catalyzes \"trans\" elimination/addition of water, and the flip guarantees that the correct stereochemistry is formed in the product. To complete the reaction, the serine and histidine residues reverse their original catalytic actions: the histidine, now basic, abstracts a proton from water, priming it as a nucleophile to attack at C2, and the protonated serine is deprotonated by the \"cis\"-aconitate double bond to complete the hydration, producing isocitrate.\n\nAconitases are expressed in bacteria to humans. Humans express the following two aconitase isozymes:\n\n"}

He was appointed to the command of the Fleet in the Baltic Sea, in succession to Sir Charles Napier, in February 1855 and led the naval support during the latter stages of the Crimean War, enforcing a strict blockade and carrying out the bombardment of Sveaborg in August 1855. He was appointed First Naval Lord in the first Palmerston ministry in November 1857 and then, after stepping down to be Second Naval Lord during the second Derby–Disraeli ministry, he stepped up again to become First Naval Lord in the second Palmerston ministry in June 1859 remaining in office until his death. The Prime-Minister (Viscount Palmerston) described Dundas as \"a most distinguished officer\".\n\nThe son of Robert Dundas, 2nd Viscount Melville and his wife Anne (née Huck-Saunders), Dundas was educated at Harrow School and joined the Royal Navy in 1817. After initial training at the Royal Navy College at Portsmouth he joined the frigate HMS \"Ganymede\" in the Mediterranean Fleet. Promoted to lieutenant on 16 June 1821 and to commander on 23 June 1823, he was given command of the sloop HMS \"Sparrowhawk\" on the North America and West Indies Station in June 1823.\n\nPromoted to captain on 17 July 1824, Dundas took command of the sixth-rate HMS \"Volage\" on the North America and West Indies Station in September 1825 and then of the third-rate HMS \"Warspite\" on the East Indies Station in December 1826.

Dundas led the naval support during the latter stages of the Crimean War enforcing a strict blockade in the Baltic. Dundas was hesitant but the French admiral Charles Penaud persuaded him to attack the Russian fleet in the harbour of Sweaborg on 9–10 August 1855. The British provided most of the attacking force. Much of the bombardment was done with smaller vessels that the shore batteries found hard to hit. Six Russians ships of the line and 17 smaller warships were destroyed, and the Russians suffered 2,000 casualties. The allies suffered one death, 15 wounded, and damage to only one British sloop.\n\nDundas was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 5 February 1856 and became Second-in-command of the Mediterranean Fleet, hoisting his flag in HMS \"Duke of Wellington\", in April 1856.

The songs featured in the film was composed by Deepak Dev, while Ouseppachan provided the background score. \"Udayananu Tharam\" presents the Malayalam film industry through a satirical viewpoint.\n\nThe financial and artistic crisis which plagued the once glittering Malayalam film industry at the turn of the 21st century lies at the center of the story. It depicts the struggles of Udayabhanu (Mohanlal), who is an assistant director and who aspires to be a director. But he is thwarted in his attempts by a scheming friend and junior artist, Rajappan Thengamoodu (Sreenivasan), who steals his screenplay to become superstar Saroj Kumar.\n\nThe film made the biggest ever opening until then in the history of Malayalam cinema. The film won two Kerala State Film Awards, for Best Debut Director and for Best Choreography. The film was remade into Tamil cinema as \"Velli Thirai\" in 2008, and into Bollywood as \"Shortkut\" in 2009. A spin-off titled \"Padmasree Bharat Dr. Saroj Kumar\" was released in 2012.\n\nUdayabhanu (Mohanlal) is a hardcore worshipper of films and a talented assistant director, who learns to write and direct his own film at a time when the industry is filled with dubious filmmakers. Rajappan Thengummoodu (Sreenivasan) is a rather crooked friend of Udayabhanu and an aspiring and failed actor.\n\nUdayabhanu finally prepares to shoot his first film based on his own script, he discovers to his horror that Rajappan has stolen his manuscript, and filming is underway with Rajappan playing the leading role, which eventually propels him to stardom. Udhayabhanu soon finds himself faced with a career and personal crisis, with his faltering relations with his actress wife Madhumati (Meena) contributing to the latter. She leaves the house later after Udayan causes chaos in the house after getting drunk, saying that he lost everything.\n\nLater, with the help of producer Babykuttan (Mukesh), Udayabanu prepares to direct another film, but he is forced to cast Rajappan as the hero since he was the star with most market value at that time. Rajappan takes up the offer, since he is also at a plateau of his career, but refuses to co-operate and throws tantrums and causes maximum trouble when possible. He spends most of his time actively flirting with the actresses in the film.\n\nTowards the end of the shoot, using a perceived insult as a ruse, Rajappan leaves the set leaving the film half way with the hope that this will destroy Udayabanu's career for ever. But Udayabanu devises clever tactics and shoots the remaining scenes with Rajappan without him even being aware of it.\n\nAt the end, the film is a critical and box office success, which also saves Rajappan from his damaging career, Rajappan realises his mistakes, admits publicly that Udayabanu is the real star and not himself and apologises to Udayabhanu.\n\n\nThe film was the directorial debut of Rosshan Andrrews who started as an assistant director in Malayalam cinema. He changed his name from Roshan Andrews to Rosshan Andrrews as per numerology before the film's release. The film's story was conceived by Andrrews, who prepared the story three year back but producers were not willing to take the film as they thought a film based on film industry would not work. He then narrated the story to Sreenivasan who developed it into a screenplay, which took two years, and introduced him to C. Karunakaran who agreed to produce the film.

It concerned the partial redeployment of Israeli military forces from Hebron in accordance with the 1995 Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip (\"Oslo II\"). According to the Protocol, \"Area H-1\" (about 80%) would come under Palestinian control, while \"Area H-2\" would remain under Israeli control. A large Palestinian majority still lives in both \"Area H-1\" and \"Area H-2\". The redeployment started on 16 January 1997. The protocol has never been ratified by either of the contracting parties. \n\nThe Hebron Protocol initiated the third partial Israeli withdrawal, after the Gaza–Jericho Agreement, and the further withdrawal from populated Palestinian areas in the West Bank. Hebron was excepted from the other West Bank cities, who got the status of Area A in the Oslo II Accord. The withdrawal was originally scheduled for completion before 28 March 1996.\n\nOn 7 January 1997, the parties agreed on some provisions concerning the Old City (Agreed Minute). On 13 January 1997, Prime Minister Netanyahu met with Chairman Arafat in the presence of U.S. envoy Dennis Ross. On 14 January, they made known that they had reached an agreement. On 15 January, the Palestinian Authority in a joint meeting with the Executive Committee of the PLO approved the document. The Israeli Cabinet also approved the document. The Knesset approved the Protocol on 16 January by a vote of 87 to 17, the Labor opposition voting with the government. The same day, the IDF began the redeployment from Hebron. The Hebron Protocol was signed on 17 January by Israeli chief negotiator General Dan Shomron and Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. On 21 January, an agreement on the presence of an international monitoring group was signed.\n\nThe Agreements provided:\n\nBefore the Knesset, Prime Minister Netanyahu declared on 16 January with respect to the Protocol:\n\n″\"But our goals are different\" [than those of the previous Governments]\". We are using the time interval in the agreement to achieve our goals: to maintain the unity of Jerusalem, to ensure the security depth necessary for the defence of the State, to insist on the right of Jews to settle in their land, and to propose to the Palestinians a suitable arrangement for self-rule but without the sovereign Powers which pose a threat to the State of Israel.″\"\n\nOn 29 January, the Israeli Government granted Jewish enclaves in Hebron national priority “A” and “B” to receive special government funding for settlement building.\n\nThe protocol was a complex set of arrangements that consisted of a number of segments, in chronological order:\n\nThe \"Agreed Minute\" was concluded on 7 January 1997, and in it Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat agreed that the process of reopening an important street in the West Bank town of Hebron, the al-Shuhada Street, would begin immediately, and would be completed within four months. This work would take place in conjunction with the implementation of the main Hebron Protocol.\n\nOn 13 January 1997, the parties renewed talks on an agreement of troop withdrawal from Hebron, and a fixed timetable for withdrawals from the West Bank, mediated by King Hussein of Jordan. On 15 January 1997, Netanyahu and Arafat reached an agreement on the Protocol. U.S. envoy Dennis Ross drew up a \"note for the record\" to spell out the commitments. The partial Israeli withdrawal would begin within the next 10 days.\n\nThe two leaders agreed that the Oslo peace process must move forward to succeed and that they had concerns and obligations about the Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip (\"Interim Agreement\") of 1995. Accordingly, the two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to implement the Interim Agreement on the basis of reciprocity and, in that context, conveyed the following undertakings to each other:\n\n\"Israeli responsibilities:\"\n\nThe Israeli side reaffirmed its commitments to further redeployment in phases. Prisoner release issues would be dealt with in accordance with the Interim Agreement's provisions. Negotiations on the following outstanding issues from the Interim Agreement would be immediately resumed in parallel: safe passage; Gaza Airport; Gaza port; passages; economic, financial, civilian and security issues. Permanent status negotiations would be resumed within two months after implementation of the Hebron Protocol.\n\n\"Palestinian responsibilities:\"\n\nThe Palestinian side reaffirmed its commitments to: Complete the process of revising the Palestinian National Charter; Fighting terror and preventing violence; Strengthening security cooperation; Preventing incitement and hostile propaganda; Combat systematically and effectively terrorist organizations and infrastructure; Apprehension, prosecution and punishment of terrorists; Confiscation of illegal firearms. The size of Palestinian police would be in keeping with the Interim Agreement. Exercise of governmental activity, and location of Palestinian governmental offices, would be as specified in the Interim Agreement.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Interim Agreement both parties agreed on this protocol for the implementation of the redeployment in Hebron. \n\n\n\nAt the time of signing of the Hebron Protocol, United States Secretary of State Warren Christopher provided a letter to Benjamin Netanyahu. In the letter, he explained the policy of the United States to support and promote full implementation of the Interim Agreement.\n\nHe had impressed upon Arafat the need for the Palestinian Authority to ensure public order and internal security within the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The US believed that the first phase of further redeployments should take place as soon as possible, and that all three phases of the further redeployments should be completed within twelve months from the implementation of the first phase of the further redeployments but not later than mid-1998.\n\nChristopher also emphasized the US' commitment to Israel's security and the US' position that Israel is entitled to secure and defensible borders, which should be directly negotiated and agreed with its neighbours.\n\nThe Hebron protocol brought in the Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH) as a third part. On 21 January 1997, the parties signed the \"Agreement on the Temporary International Presence in the City of Hebron\". A non-military international monitoring group of 180 persons would be established in Hebron. The agreement would replace the temporary agreement of 9 May 1996.\nThe 1996 agreement had provided that as part of the redeployment of Israeli military forces in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, there would the establishment of a Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH). In the 1996 agreement, the two sides invited Norway to send a group of 50–60 Norwegians to act as an \"advance TIPH\" preparing for the new TIPH to be established following the redeployment. The Norwegian personnel arrived and commenced their operation. When the Hebron negotiations were completed and signed, it also provided that the TIPH would consist of up to 180 persons from Norway, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey, with Norway being responsible for the coordination of the TIPH's activity.\n\nThe task of the TIPH was to monitor and report on efforts to maintain normal life in Hebron, to provide a feeling of security among the Palestinians of Hebron and to help promote stability. In addition, the TIPH personnel were to assist in the promotion and execution of projects, to encourage economic development and growth in the city and to provide reports. The TIPH had no military or police functions.\n\nThe TIPH members were identifiable by their distinctive khaki uniforms and the special emblem on their uniforms and vehicles. Practical aspects of their operation and activity were set out in a memorandum of understanding concluded by the participating countries with the agreement of the two sides.\n\n"}

There is one living genus, Mystacina, with two species, one of which is believed to have become extinct in the 1960s. They are medium-sized bats, about in length, with grey, velvety fur.\n\n\nThe family also contains the extinct genus \"Icarops\" known from Oligocene and Miocene fossils found in Australia, as well as several fossils from the contemporary Saint Bathans Fauna in New Zealand. The oldest unambiguous fossils of the living genus date to the late Pleistocene of New Zealand, though the aforementioned Saint Bathans species may also belong to the genus. A second extinct genus, \"Vulcanops\", lived sympatrically with \"Mystacina\" in New Zealand from the Miocene until its extinction during the Pleistocene. The study describing \"Vulcanops\" also renders \"Icarops\" paraphyletic in regards to the rest of the family.\n\nMystacines appear to have been an old Gondwanan lineage; they diverged from other bat groups within Noctilionoidea (a primarily Gondwanan group otherwise including Noctilionidae, Phyllostomidae and Mormoopidae) around 51-41 million years ago.\n\nMystacinids have some unusual characteristics compared to other bats. They spend much of the time on the ground, instead of flying, and are unique in having the ability to fold their wings into a leathery membrane when not in use. Another distinctive feature of the group is an additional projection on some of the claws, which may aid in digging or climbing. They are omnivorous, eating fruit and carrion in addition to ground-dwelling arthropods. They also eat pollen and nectar, which they are able to collect with their extensible tongues. They sometimes chew out burrows in rotting wood, but can also roost in rock crevices or the burrows of seabirds.\n\nMany old sources refer to the terrestriality of these bats as a trait acquired due to island endemism, assumed to have evolved due to the absence of terrestrial mammals in New Zealand. However, \"Icarops\", a mainland Australian genus, shows adaptations to terrestriality, suggesting that it evolved prior to the colonisation of New Zealand, in an environment dominated by terrestrial mammals such as marsupials and monotremes. Furthermore, the Saint Bathans fossil species co-existed with the Saint Bathans mammal, suggesting that New Zealand wasn't devoid of land mammals when these bats first arrived.\n\nThey give birth once each summer, to a single young. They are able to hibernate during the winter.\n\nIn 2010 the Department of Conservation discovered a feral cat that was responsible for killing over 100 short-tailed bats over a seven-day period in a forested area on the southern slope of Mount Ruapehu.\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}

The school was located at Raeburn Park in a Harbour Board property overlooking Singapore harbour hence the school was also known as the Harbour Board School. Within 18 months the initial intake of 29 students had grown dramatically to a full-capacity school roll of 210 students. A house system was implemented and students were placed in one of the three houses: Keppel, Raffles or Ridley. The school colours were yellow and brown hence the boys' school uniforms consisted of yellow shirts and brown shorts and the girls wore yellow and white gingham check dresses.\n\nThe management of the school was transferred to the British European Association (BEA - now known as the British Association of Singapore) in 1960. The BEA also managed Tanglin Preparatory School. Following Singapore's independence in 1965, the Harbour Board was replaced by The Port of Singapore Authority, which informed the school their lease would not be renewed after 1972. The school moved to Alexandra Park into the vacated Royal Army Ordnance Corps Mess and the adjoining cell block (from which the bars were removed!). The first overseas contracted teacher was appointed in 1973 although locally employed women, trained teachers from the UK, New Zealand or Australia, made up the majority of teachers. The same year a male Headteacher was employed and he was the first male member of staff. It was another two years before the first male teacher was appointed. In 1974 Raeburn Park came under management of Tanglin Trust Ltd which also managed Tanglin Preparatory and Weyhill Preparatory schools. The three schools were henceforth managed by one common Board of Governors.\n\nIn 1976 with the final withdrawal of British troops the school moved to Portsdown Road opposite Weyhill Preparatory School. Raeburn and Weyhill operated separately but shared the playing field between them.

{"id": "1948780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1948780", "title": "Canadian cultural protectionism", "text": "Canadian cultural protectionism\n\nCultural protectionism in Canada has, since the mid-20th century, taken the form of conscious, interventionist attempts on the part of various Governments of Canada to promote Canadian cultural production and limit the effect of foreign culture on the domestic audience. Sharing a large border and a common language with the United States, Canadian politicians have perceived the need to preserve and support a culture separate from US-based North American culture in the globalized media arena. Canada's efforts to maintain its cultural differences from the US and Mexico have been balanced by countermeasures in trade arrangements, including the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\n\nOne of the first such responses to perceived American cultural invasion in the later half of the 20th century was through the National Film Act of 1950, which increased the authority of the government's National Film Board to finance and promote Canadian culture.\n\nThe Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences, also known as the Massey Commission, was released in 1951. It advocated the creation of a government sponsored organization that would exclusively finance Canadian artists. This organization, the Canada Council for the Arts, is responsible for the distribution of large sums of money to individuals or groups that promote what it defines as Canadian culture. The Council had a greater impact than its parent, and continues to support emerging Canadian cultural talent that it approves of. The Commission also works to foster a general sense that Canada risks being swamped by an invasion of foreign culture. This led to an increased fear that Canada might very well lose a distinct, national culture.\n\nIn 1955, with this fear in mind, the government appointed Robert Fowler to chair a Royal Commission that is known as the Fowler Commission. The Fowler Commission reported that the majority of Canadian stations, including the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, used not Canadian material, but American. It was the Commission's belief that a quota system should be enacted to protect Canadian content on the airwaves.\n\nThis recommendation, passed in 1956, affirmed the CBC as Canada's official broadcasting station and initiated the quota system. In its inception, the quota system said that 45% of all content broadcast on the airwaves must be Canadian in origin. While this number has fluctuated over the years, it has generally required that approximately half of all programming on Canadian airwaves be Canadian in origin. However, Canadian content includes not only arts and drama, but news and sports, and most private broadcast networks skew towards the latter rather than the former, to allow for large quantities of foreign dramas. To the dismay of many Canadians, this leaves more \"culturally\" oriented Canadian programming off the major-network airwaves.\n\nCultural protectionism by the Canadian government gave preference through tax rebates and lower postal rates to magazines published and printed in Canada. This limited the options of American publishing companies to sell magazines in Canada. Some, specifically \"Reader's Digest\" and \"Time\" magazines, got around the restrictions by publishing \"split runs\", that is, printing \"Canadian editions\" of American magazines, rather than publishing uniquely Canadian magazines. In 1998, after the Canadian government attempted to outlaw these types of magazines, the publishers of American magazines, including \"Sports Illustrated\" and \"Time Magazine\" successfully pressured the Canadian government to back down, citing World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and threatening a NAFTA lawsuit.\n\nThe effectiveness of the cultural protectionism measures have been somewhat uneven. T. B. Symons, shortly after the Fowler report's installation in Canadian law, released a report entitled \"To Know Ourselves\". The report looked at Canadian high-school history books and found that while the Winnipeg General Strike went without mention, the books contained two chapters on Abraham Lincoln. The report also looked at Canadian children's general knowledge of their government and most could not identify the Canadian head of state (Queen Elizabeth II) and the basis for Canada's law and founding (the British North America Act 1867).\n\nIn 1969 Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau said he felt that: \"Living next to you [the United States] is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant. No matter how friendly or temperate the beast, one is affected by every twitch and grunt.\"\n\nBy the 1990s, the great majority of television, films, music, books and magazines consumed by Canadians continued to be produced outside the country.\n\nCreators of Canadian rap music in 2000 complained that many radio stations did not include rap in their Canadian music content, and television stations aired few rap music videos and news stories, and yet the CRTC was slow to grant broadcast licenses for urban music radio stations.\n\nIn recent years the advent of online music and video has allowed international content providers to bypass CRTC regulations in many cases, although existing private contracts keep certain international content providers, such as Hulu, out of Canada entirely.\n\n"}

The first versions of Gpcode used a custom-written encryption routine that was easily broken. Variant Gpcode.ak writes the encrypted file to a new location, and deletes the unencrypted file, and this allows an undeletion utility to recover some of the files. Once some encrypted+unencrypted pairs have been found, this sometimes gives enough information to decrypt other files. Variant Gpcode.am uses symmetric encryption, which made key recovery very easy.\nIn late November 2010, a new version called Gpcode.ax was reported. It uses stronger encryption (RSA-1024 and AES-256) and physically overwrites the encrypted file, making recovery nearly impossible.\n\nKaspersky Lab has been able to make contact with the author of the program, and verify that the individual is the real author, but have so far been unable to determine his real world identity.\n\n"}

One of the most terrestrial of bats, it is notable for foraging more on the forest floor than any other bat species. Its population is declining, a result of forest clearance and introduced predators.\n\nNew Zealand lesser short-tailed bats are relatively small, being in head-body length, with a wingspan of . Adults weigh before feeding, although this may increase by as much as 30% after a full night's foraging. One of only two living species of bats in New Zealand, they can be easily distinguished from New Zealand long-tailed bats by the presence of relatively large, pointed ears, prominent nostrils, and by their tails. In the short-tailed bat, the tail is only long, but extends for at least half of that length beyond the edge of the uropatagium, whereas the longer tail of the other species is entirely enclosed within it.\n\nThe bat has a long, conical snout, with numerous whiskers, and terminating in large, tubular nostrils. The tongue is long and slender, typically in length, and has a number of hair-like structures at the tip, that aid in feeding on nectar. Another unique distinguishing feature of the species is the presence of small talons at the base of the main claws on both its toes and wings, thought to aid in both crawling and climbing. The bat has very thick fur, which varies from dark brown to mousy-grey, and is slightly paler on the underside of the animal.\n\nShort-tailed bats are found primarily on the North Island of New Zealand, where they inhabit forests from sea level to the tree line at about . Within the island, at least 9 distinct populations have been identified, with most being located in the central regions. A few isolated populations are known from South Island, including one at Fiordland. Smaller populations have also been identified on Codfish Island and Little Barrier Island.\n\nA colony of around 300 short-tailed bats was also found in the Waiohine Valley of the Tararua Forest Park in the late 1990s. The only known population of short-tailed bats in southern North Island, they may be related to both the volcanic plateau and the southern short-tailed bats. They became isolated during a glacial period in the centre of North Island, and through volcanic activity, more than 90,000 years ago. Pups from this unique and isolated colony, born in captivity, have been transferred to Kapiti Island in an attempt to establish an insurance population in a predator-free environment.\n\nThree subspecies have been named on the basis of their morphological features:\n\nHowever, genetic analysis of short-tailed bats from across New Zealand has, instead, identified six potential subspecies, with overlapping ranges. These do not clearly match the three generally recognised taxa shown above. A fourth putative subspecies, \"M. t. robusta\" was identified in 1984, but was subsequently confirmed as a distinct species, the New Zealand greater short-tailed bat, now believed to be extinct.\n\nShort-tailed bats are omnivorous and opportunistic, feeding on whatever food is available in their environments. They forage in areas of dense forest and deep leaf litter, and may travel considerable distances from roosting to foraging sites each night. Their wings have a low aspect ratio and low wing loading, suggesting high manoeuvrability and moderate flight speed, suitable both for long travel and foraging close to the ground. They have been reported to eat insects, especially beetles, flies, and moths, as well as flowers, fruit, nectar, and pollen.\n\nThe bats may be an important pollinator of the wood rose (\"Dactylanthus taylorii\"), a threatened parasitic plant which grows on the roots of trees on the forest floor.\n\nShort-tailed bats are nocturnal, spending the day roosting in hollow trees. Many bats roost alone, using small cavities in the wood, but colonies of over a hundred individuals are not uncommon. Although they generally use natural cavities or crevices, they have also been reported to chew out burrows within the wood using their sharp incisor teeth. Such burrows consist of hollowed out chambers connected by narrow tunnels up to several metres in length. They typically spend only a few weeks at any given roosting site, before moving on, although individual roosts may be reused repeatedly over the course of several decades.\n\nThe bats emerge from their roosts 20 to 150 minutes after sunset, and forage for much of the night. Short-tailed bats spend only around 30% of their foraging time catching insects in the air, typically flying less than above the ground, and a further 40% feeding from plants. The remaining 30% is spent hunting on the forest floor, a higher proportion than any other species of bat. To assist with this unusual style of hunting, short-tailed bats are able to fold their wings inside a protective sheath formed from their membranes, and the wings have only a very limited propatagium, making them more flexible and mobile. Movement along the ground is also assisted by strong hind limbs and a robust pelvic girdle, and by the additional talons on their claws.\n\nThey hunt their prey using scent, passive hearing, and echolocation. Their main calls have a wide bandwidth and are multiharmonic, with a peak amplitude of 27 to 28 kHz. They also make shorter pulsed, frequency modulated calls. The bats enter torpor in cold weather and stay in their roosts for up to 10 days at a time before emerging to feed. They may also enter daily torpor when roosting alone. However, they are capable of remaining active even in subzero temperatures when necessary.\n\nShort-tailed bats are lek breeders, with males occupying individual mating roosts during the breeding season and using repetitive ultrasonic calls to attract females. The males also mark the entrances to their mating roosts with an oily secretion produced in scent glands on the throat; the oil has a musky odour, and may help to attract the females. Mating most commonly takes place between February and May.\n\nAfter mating, the embryo enters a state of delayed implantation through the winter, so a single young is born in the summer. Newborn bats are hairless, but otherwise well-developed, and weigh just . The permanent teeth erupt at three weeks, and the young are fully furred and able to fly by four weeks of age. They leave the maternal roost at six weeks, and grow rapidly; they are fully grown within three months.\n\nThe subspecies of the lesser short-tailed bat have been classified by the New Zealand Department of Conservation as \"Nationally Vulnerable\" or \"At Risk\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. This species is the sole host of the New Zealand batfly, which lives in a symbiotic relationship with it.\n\n\n"}

Once, his birthplace was misunderstood to be Jhirk, an old small town near Karachi, which was later revealed to be untrue. The reality was disclosed in the book \"My Brother\" written in the 1960s by Muhammad Ali Jinnah's sister, Fatima Jinnah in his biography wherein she described the salient features of her brother's life. She mentioned their ancestral village, Paneli, in the state of Gondal, Kathiawar, in the province of Gujarat, in present-day India. Their father, Mr. Jinnah Bhai Poonja, had settled in Karachi because of a business partnership with an English Merchant company named Grams Trading Company, whose office was then located in Karachi. Jinnah's ancestral family and their progenies including M. A. Jinnah's daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren have been residents, to this day, of the province of Gujarat and Bombay. Muhammad Ali Jinnah's father got the house (now Wazir Mansion) for rent in 1874 and settled here for some time. By 1900, he again returned to his native state, Gujarat, British India. \"Gowardhan Das was also among the owners of this building from whom Wazir Ali Ponawala (from whom the house had got its name 'Wazir Mansion') bought it at some point in 1904.\"\n\nThe Government of Pakistan, in 1953, acquired this historic building. Under Ancient Monuments Preservation Act,the government protected it. Then the Pakistan Public Works Department (PWD) was assigned the work of its conservation and renovation. It was formally inaugurated as Jinnah's birthplace museum on 14 August 1953. A project of strengthening, preservation, and rehabilitation was completed by the government in 2010. Now this birthplace museum is a three-storey building with a library and museum galleries.\n\nThe house now serves as a museum and a national archive. \"The house where Mohammad Ali Jinnah spent 16 years of his childhood and youth is a precious national monument that provides inspiration to our nation.\"\nThere used to be a Karachi Circular Railway station called Wazir Mansion.\n"}
{"id": "1948818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1948818", "title": "Temple of Anahita, Kangavar", "text": "Temple of Anahita, Kangavar\n\nThe Anahita Temple () is the name of one of two archaeological sites in Iran popularly thought to have been attributed to the ancient deity Anahita. The larger and more widely known of the two is located at Kangāvar in Kermanshah Province. The other is located at Bishapur. \n\nThe remains at Kangavar reveal an edifice that is Hellenistic in character, and yet display Persian architectural designs. The plinth's enormous dimensions for example, which measure just over 200m on a side, and its megalithic foundations, which echo Achaemenid stone platforms, \"constitute Persian elements\". This is thought to be corroborated by the \"two lateral stairways that ascend the massive stone platform recalling Achaemenid traditions\", particularly that of the Apadana Palace at Persepolis.\n\nAnother Iranian construction with Hellenistic characteristics is the Khurra mausoleum in Markazi Province.\n\nDispute exists among scholars on the correct identity of the main structure at the site. The \"Encyclopædia Iranica\" in this regard concludes:\n\nExcavation first began in 1968, by which time the \"large structure with its great Ionic columns set on a high stone platform\" had been associated with a comment by Isidore of Charax, that refers to a \"temple of Artemis\" (\"Parthian Stations\" 6). References to Artemis in Iran are generally interpreted to be references to Anahita, and thus Isidore's \"temple of Artemis\" came to be understood as a reference to a temple of Anahita.\n\nConsequently, it has been commonly believed that the site was a \"columnar temple dedicated to Anahit.\" Karim Pirnia, one of the proponents of this theory, believes that the construction belongs to the Parthian style, which underwent renovations in the Sassanid period. Warwick Ball considers the structure \"one of the greatest works of Parthian architecture\" which has an \"eastern Roman Temple form\", with the architectural emphasis being on the temenos. As with Arthur Upham Pope (1965, 1971), Ball (2001) also agrees that the temple architecturally \"recalls Achaemenid traditions\". These and a number of other scholars continue to examine the site as being possibly attributed to the deity Anahita.\n\nIn 1981, a report by an excavator of the site, Massoud Azarnoush however contended that the construction \"did not have the necessary characteristics that could identify it as a temple\". Ali Akbar Sarfaraz, former head of the archaeology team of the Tehran University, shares this opinion. The popular theory held by this group is that the ruin is of a \"late Sasanian palace.\"\n\nFinally, a third group contends that the site was originally constructed in the Achaemenid period, and underwent several phases of construction. Of this group, one can mention archeologist Seifollah Kambakhshfard.\n\nOriginally, 200 BCE was proposed as the date of the site's construction. \"Under the Parthians any observable western influence can just as well be a survival from the Hellenistic period, which is why the monument at Kangāvar was once acceptably dated as early Parthian while recent investigations proved it to be late Sasanian.\"\n\nIn this regard, Warwick Ball however states:\n\nThe Temple of Anahita at Bishapur, \"was probably built by Roman prisoners, is well masoned of ashlar blocked walls, and with trapezoid shaped doorways.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1948822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1948822", "title": "Fourteen Words", "text": "Fourteen Words\n\nFourteen Words, 14, or 14/88, is a reference to the fourteen-word slogan \"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children,\" or the less commonly used \"Because the beauty of the White Aryan woman must not perish from the earth.\" The slogans were originally coined by white supremacist David Lane, a founding member of the terrorist organization The Order and serve as a rallying cry for militant white nationalists across the globe. \n\nThe terms were coined while he was serving a 190-year sentence in federal prison for violating the civil rights of Jewish talk show host Alan Berg, who was murdered by another member of the group in June 1984. The slogans were publicized through now-defunct 14 Word Press, founded in 1995 by Lane's wife to disseminate her husband's writings.\n\nLane also used the phrasing in other writings, including the \"14 points\" in his \"white genocide\" manifesto, and further in his 88 Precepts essay, stressing his support for racial and ethnic religions, opposition to multiracialism and miscegenation, and support for racial separatism. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Fourteen Words slogan is derived from a passage in Adolf Hitler's autobiographical book \"Mein Kampf\"; the Fourteen Words are prominently used by neo-Nazis, white power skinheads and certain white nationalists and the alt-right.\n\nLane's ideology was anti-American and Lane considered loyalty to the United States to be\n\"race treason\" and upheld a secondary slogan entitled \"OUR RACE IS OUR NATION\" or \"ORION\", viewing the United States as committing genocide against white people and as having been founded as a New World Order to finalize a global Zionist government.\n\nBeing bitterly opposed to the continued existence of the United States as a political entity, and labelling it the \"murderer of the White race\", Lane further advocated domestic terrorism as a tool to carve out a \"white homeland\". To that end, Lane issued a declaration called \"Moral Authority\" published through now-defunct 14 Word Press and shared through the publications of Aryan Nations, World Church of the Creator and other white separatist groups, referring to the United States as a \"Red, White and Blue traveling mass murder machine\", while asserting \"true moral authority belongs to those who resist genocide\".\n\nThe terms were later adopted by white supremacists and neo-nazis, white nationalists and identitarians, members of the far-right and alt-right, the most widely used variation being, \"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.\" Another less commonly used variation is: \"Because the beauty of the White Aryan woman must not perish from the earth.\"\nIt is sometimes combined with 88, as in \"14/88\" or \"1488\". The 8s represent the eighth letter of the alphabet (H), and \"HH\" stands for \"Heil Hitler\". This can also be a reference to Lane's 88 Precepts, which when combined with \"14\" refer to Lane's white supremacist neo-pagan religion, Wotanism.\n\nThe slogan has been used in acts of white supremacist terrorism and violence. It was central to the symbolism of 2008's Barack Obama assassination plot, which intended to kill 88 African Americans, including future President Barack Obama (at that time the Democratic Party nominee), 14 of whom were to be beheaded. Skinhead Curtis Allgier notably tattooed the words on to his body after he murdered corrections officer Stephen Anderson, and Dylann Roof's race war-inspired Charleston church shooting was influenced by the slogan.\n\nA strong resemblance of the first definition to a statement in Adolf Hitler's \"Mein Kampf\" has been pointed out, albeit not by Lane or by Fourteen Word Press. Scholars such as Barry Balleck have stated that Lane was almost certainly influenced by Hitler, specifically the following statement in \"Mein Kampf\".\n\nWhat we must fight for is to safeguard the existence and reproduction of our race and our people, the sustenance of our children and the purity of our blood, the freedom and independence of the fatherland, so that our people may mature for the fulfillment of the mission allotted it by the creator of the universe. Every thought and every idea, every doctrine and all knowledge, must serve this purpose. And everything must be examined from this point of view and used or rejected according to its utility. \"(Vol. I, Chapter 8)\"\n\nAccording to scholar Mattias Gardell, David Lane taught something he called the \"Pyramid Prophecy 666\", which included the concept that a Bible code was inserted by \"Aryan adepts\" within the King James Version of the Christian Bible. Gardell's book \"Gods of the Blood\" states \"The number 1776 appears in the numeric square of Mars in which is found the Star of David and its 741 formula, 741 also being the value of the 14 Words in simple English gematria.\" Lane was described in \"Pyramid Prophecy 666\" as the \"man\" in the Book of Revelation with America being \"second-head\" of the Beast and the 88 Precepts being the \"little book\" in Revelation 10, views that were censored by Ron McVan and others who found the messianic claims counterproductive by \"turning off potential converts\".\n\n\n\n\nThe slogans and numerology of \"14\" and \"88\" have been used by many white supremacists, both before and after committing violence (such as in manifestos), as well as symbolically within criminal acts. These include Order-member David Lane, assassination attempters Paul Schlesselman and Daniel Cowart, and murderers Dylann Roof and Curtis Allgier. Allgier has \"14\" and \"88\" tattooed on his forehead above and to the sides of the words \"skin\" and \"head\" above his eyes in his mugshot.\n\nThe assassination of Jewish talk show host Alan Berg in June 1984, is considered as The Order's most infamous act of terrorism. Order member Bruce Pierce served as the gunman in the murder and Lane the getaway driver. During Lane's imprisonment on separate convictions (some relating to violating Alan Berg's civil rights) he created the Fourteen Words slogan. The number 14 continues to symbolize allegiance to the Aryan Nations' vision of a white homeland.\n\n\"14/88\" numerology was symbolically included in the Barack Obama assassination plot in October 2008. Both Neo-Nazis, Schlesselman and Cowart were introduced to each other online by a mutual friend who shared their white supremacist beliefs. Within a month of meeting, they had planned to kill the Democratic Party nominee by driving at their target and shooting from their vehicle. This was to be followed by a killing spree in which the men planned to kill 88 African Americans, 14 of whom were to be beheaded. They were targeting mostly children at an unidentified, predominantly black school. Shortly after their arrest, their vehicle was discovered to have \"14\" and \"88\" written onto it.\n\nMass-shooter Wade Michael Page, who killed six and wounded four members of the Sikh community in August 2012, had been a supporter of the Fourteen Words, and was found with \"14\" onto a Celtic Cross tattooed on his arm, after committing suicide at the scene of the crime. About a year before the shooting, Page wrote on the Internet regarding the slogan, \"Passive submission is indirect support to the oppressors. Stand up for yourself and live the 14 words.\"\n\nAfter the Charleston mass-murder shooting in June 2015, Dylann Roof's ideology and apparent manifesto emerged in the media with multiple references to \"1488\", these included several photos of Roof pictured alongside the numbers. He symbolically brought 88 bullets to the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church to carry out the shooting, in which nine African Americans were killed.\n\nRobert Bowers, the gunman suspected of killing 11 people and wounding 6 at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, included the numeric code \"1488\" in the header image of his Gab social media account. Bowers also expressed Christian Identity rhetoric declaring \"the lord jesus christ is come in the flesh\" while espousing anti-Semitic views that \"jews are children of satan\".\n\nBrenton Harrison Tarrant, the shooter responsible for the attacks posted images on Twitter of firearms and published his manifesto \"The Great Replacement\" which both had the neo-Nazi symbol Black Sun and the slogan (as \"14\" or \"14 Words\") engraved on the weapons and also in the manifesto. The firearms were used in the shooting.\n\n"}

W. Awdry, and the spin-off television series \"Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends\". Trevor is an agricultural engine – a traction engine designed for general farm work, and is thus suited to his work on the Island of Sodor at Wellsworth Vicarage Orchard. Trevor is one of only two steam-powered road vehicles that appear in the books, the other being George the Steamroller. He is voiced by Nigel Pilkington in the UK, and Christopher Ragland in the US in the CGI Series.\n\nTrevor is first introduced in the story 'Saved from Scrap', in Rev. Awdry's ninth \"Railway Series\" book \"Edward the Blue Engine\". He is presented as a dilapidated traction engine driven by Jem Cole; having formerly performed odd-jobs on farms, he has now outlived his master's perceived usefulness. The reader is told how Trevor was saved from being scrapped after being noticed by Edward the Blue Engine, who persuaded the local vicar (the Reverend Charles Laxey) to save Trevor; Trevor is taken to the vicar's orchard, where he saws firewood and gives children rides around the orchard on church fête days.\n\nHe has made friends with BoCo and Edward, but is very quiet and shy. He loves the railway and has no prejudice against any of the engines. He now lives at the vicarage orchard at Wellsworth on Edward's Branch Line.\n\nAs in the Railway Series, Edward discovered Trevor in Crock's Scrap Yard, and later persuaded the Vicar to purchase Trevor and restore him for work at the Wellsworth Vicarage. Some time after this, Trevor temporarily ran out of work at the vicarage and so was loaned to Sir Topham Hatt to help with the construction of Knapford Harbour, during which time he met Thomas. Both Trevor and Edward also helped the Vicar to organize a garden party to raise money for a seaside trip for underprivileged children, during which Trevor proved how useful he could be after he and Terence rescued Bertie, who had gotten stuck in the mud at the Vicarage orchard.\n\nIn later seasons, Trevor has been seen working in other places on the Island such as Farmer McColl's Field, the Sodor Airport, and once was an attraction at the Sodor Steam Fair. He has also had two accidents when pulling carts, both times due to the cart being stuck on a level crossing and then being destroyed after Gordon crashed into it.\n\nTrevor appeared in feature length specials including: \"The Great Discovery\" and \"\".\n\nIn The Railway Series book \"Edward the Blue Engine\", Trevor is always painted black with gold boiler bands and chimney cap.\n\nTrevor's second appearance is in the much later book \"Thomas and the Twins\". In this he has a distinctly 'odd' appearance when compared with real preserved traction engines in general. This may be because he is painted all-over green, including his smokebox, and has bright yellow boiler bands. Traction engines and railway locomotives \"\"always\"\" have their smokeboxes painted black, presumably so as to not show the dirt from oil, ash and soot. On the other hand, his boiler is drawn larger than in the earlier book, with a diameter much more in keeping with the proportions of an 8nhp traction engine.\n\nThroughout the television series, Trevor's shape resembles the pictures in the earlier book, but is consistently painted dark green with red wheels, black smokebox and gold boiler bands. However, he is correctly modelled with a third (middle) boiler band, which is 'missing' from the book illustrations; an omission which contributes to his 'odd' appearance in the book. This is an unusual occurrence, where the TV series portrayal of a 'Thomas' character is closer to the real thing than the book illustrations.\n\nErtl produced a model called \"Scrap Trevor\". It featured a rather rusty version of Trevor, as well as a bogie well wagon that had \"Saved From Scrap\" printed on the side.\n\nTrevor is based around a William Foster & Co. traction engine built in the 1920s for farm work and hauling heavy loads. The Rev. 'Teddy' Boston, who was a great friend of the Rev. W. Awdry, owned a similar 1927-built Foster traction engine called Fiery Elias, which is probably the exact basis for Trevor. Many such traction engines are still used and looked after by steam enthusiasts, and are often the highlight of vintage vehicle rallies.\n\nMike O'Donnell and Junior Campbell, the former composers of the TV series, based Trevor's theme tune on the classical military march music Entrance of the Gladiators by Julius Fučík.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1948859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1948859", "title": "JRuby", "text": "JRuby\n\nJRuby is an implementation of the Ruby programming language atop the Java Virtual Machine, written largely in Java. It is free software released under a three-way EPL/GPL/LGPL license. JRuby is tightly integrated with Java to allow the embedding of the interpreter into any Java application with full two-way access between the Java and the Ruby code (similar to Jython for the Python language).\n\nJRuby's lead developers are Charles Oliver Nutter and Thomas Enebo, with many current and past contributors including Ola Bini and Nick Sieger. In September 2006, Sun Microsystems hired Enebo and Nutter to work on JRuby full-time. In June 2007, ThoughtWorks hired Ola Bini to work on Ruby and JRuby.\n\nIn July 2009, the JRuby developers left Sun to continue JRuby development at Engine Yard. In May 2012, Nutter and Enebo left Engine Yard to work on JRuby at Red Hat.\n\nJRuby was originally created by Jan Arne Petersen, in 2001. At that time and for several years following, the code was a direct port of the Ruby 1.6 C code. With the release of Ruby 1.8.6, an effort began to update JRuby to 1.8.6 features and semantics. Since 2001, several contributors have assisted the project, leading to the current () core team of around six members.\n\nJRuby 1.1 added Just-in-time compilation and Ahead-of-time compilation modes to JRuby and was already faster in most cases than the then-current Ruby 1.8.7 reference implementation.\n\nJRuby packages are available for most platforms; Fedora 9 was among the first to include it as a standard package at JRuby 1.1.1.\n\nIn July 2009, the core JRuby developers at Sun Microsystems, Charles Oliver Nutter, Thomas Enebo and Nick Sieger, joined Engine Yard to continue JRuby development. In May 2012, Nutter and Enebo left Engine Yard to work on JRuby at Red Hat.\n\nJRuby has supported compatibility with Ruby MRI versions 1.6 through 1.9.3. JRuby 1.0 supported Ruby 1.8.6, with JRuby 1.4.0 updating that compatibility to Ruby 1.8.7. JRuby 1.6.0 added simultaneous support for Ruby 1.9.2, with JRuby 1.7.0 making Ruby 1.9.3 the default execution mode (Ruby 1.8.7 compatibility is available via a command-line flag). JRuby 9.0.0.0 added support for Ruby 2.2. \n\nThe current version of JRuby (9.2.11.0) support Ruby 2.5.7. The upcoming 9.3 version will support Ruby 2.6.\n\nJRuby has been able to run the Ruby on Rails web framework since version 0.9 (May 2006), with the ability to execute RubyGems and WEBrick. Since the hiring of the two lead developers by Sun, Rails compatibility and speed have improved greatly. JRuby version 1.0 successfully passed nearly all of Rails's own test cases. Since then, developers have begun to use JRuby for Rails applications in production environments.\n\nOn February 27, 2008, Sun Microsystems and the University of Tokyo announced a joint-research project to implement a virtual machine capable of executing more than one Ruby or JRuby application on one interpreter.\n\nJSR 292 (\"Supporting Dynamically Typed Languages on the JavaTM Platform\") proposes:\n\nThe Sun Open source project Multi Language Virtual Machine aims to prototype this JSR. The first working prototype, developed as a patch on OpenJDK, was announced and made available on end of August 2008.\n\nThe JRuby team has implemented dynamic invocation into their codebase. Dynamic invocation initially shipped with the 1.1.5 release in a primitive form. Version 1.7.0 enabled it by default on Java 8 builds.\n\nThis table presents only releases that present significant steps in JRuby history, aside from versions that mainly fixed bugs and improved performance. Performance improvements are also not shown in the table below, as every release has usually brought such improvements.\n\nSince early 2006, the current JRuby core team has endeavored to move JRuby beyond being a simple C port, to support better performance and to aid eventual compilation to Java bytecode. To support this end, the team set an ambitious goal: to be able to run Ruby on Rails unmodified using JRuby. In the process of achieving this goal, the JRuby test suite expanded to such extent that the team gained confidence in the \"correctness\" of JRuby. As a result, toward the end of 2006 and in the beginning of 2007, they began to commit much more complicated redesigns and refactorings of JRuby's core subsystems.\n\nJRuby is designed to work as a mixed-mode virtual machine for Ruby, where code can be either interpreted directly, just-in-time compiled at runtime to Java bytecode, or ahead-of-time compiled to Java bytecode before execution. Until October 2007, only the interpreted mode supported all Ruby's constructs, but a full AOT/JIT compiler is available since version 1.1. The compiler design allows for interpreted and compiled code to run side-by-side, as well as decompilation to reoptimize and outputting generated bytecode as Java class files.\n\nJRuby has built-in support for Rails, RSpec, Rake, and RubyGems. It embeds an FFI subsystem to allow the use of C libraries bundled as gems. It also allows launching the Interactive Ruby Shell (irb) as Ruby MRI does.\n\nThe Netbeans Ruby Pack, available in NetBeans 6, allows IDE development with Ruby and JRuby, as well as Ruby on Rails for the two implementations of Ruby.\nIt is no longer included in NetBeans 7.0 and later.\n\nJRuby is similar to the standard Ruby interpreter except written in Java. JRuby features some of the same concepts, including object-oriented programming, and dynamic-typing as Ruby. The key difference is that JRuby is tightly integrated with Java, and can be called directly from Java programs. Java has significant footing in the development of web applications.\n\nOne powerful feature of JRuby is its ability to invoke the classes of the Java Platform. To do this, one must first load JRuby's Java support, by calling \"require 'java'\".

Since implementations vary in how much code is loaded before execution, different methods of measuring speed can lead to biased interpretations of performance advantages. The time it takes for a Java Virtual Machine itself to load is often excluded from execution times when calculating benchmarks.\n\nJRuby has the significant architectural advantage to be able to leverage JVM threads without being constrained by a global interpreter lock (similarly to Rubinius), therefore achieving full parallelism within a process, which Ruby MRI cannot achieve despite leveraging OS threads.\n\nIn a real Mongrel web server application tested in 2007, JRuby performance is better than Ruby MRI 1.8, after the Java Virtual Machine had been instantiated.\n\nIn a 2007 benchmark of Ruby implementations, JRuby was faster than Ruby MRI 1.8 in some tests, but YARV outperformed both of them.\n\nAs of April 2014, in The Computer Language Benchmarks Game, JRuby 1.7.4 typically has the same performance as Ruby MRI 2.1.0, but uses more memory.\n\n\n"}

It serves some of Sydney's Inner West and Northern suburbs. It was spun off from the old T1 North Shore, Northern & Western Line as a separate line in April 2019, to distinguish and make it more easily identified from the other T1 services. It is also a reincarnation of the older Northern Line which was under operation until 2013.\n\nThe traditional Northern Line was the suburban portion of the Main North railway line (Strathfield - Hornsby) which opened in 1886 and was electrified in 1926. When the Sydney Harbour Bridge was opened, it connected railway services from the Main North line and the City underground onto the North Shore line.\n\nPassenger services used to operate as the Main North Line (same name as the physical railway line) and was colour coded red on railway maps. It operated all the way to Cowan, until the service was truncated to Berowra in January 1992. The service, along with the North Shore Line service (yellow), later also ran along the North Shore railway line towards the City via the Harbour Bridge, forming a continuous loop via Strathfield, Epping and back to Hornsby.\nIn later years, the line operated as the Northern Line and ran from Hornsby to North Sydney via Strathfield and the City, with the North Shore line replacing services between Hornsby and Berowra. In February 2009, the Epping to Chatswood rail link was opened. In October 2009, the Northern Line service was integrated with the shuttle service between Epping and Chatswood. As a result, the traditional Northern Line was split in two, with trains from north of Epping operating via the new link, approaching the city via the North Shore Line and rejoining the traditional route before terminating at Epping.\n\nIn October 2013, the Northern Line, North Shore Line and Western line were merged to form the T1 North Shore, Northern & Western Line, which was colour coded yellow.\n\nOn weekdays, trains from the upper Northern Line (Hornsby via Macquarie University) joined up with the Western Line trains towards Richmond or Emu Plains, while trains from the lower Northern Line (Epping via Strathfield) joined up with the North Shore Line trains towards Hornsby or Berowra. On weekends, trains ran similar to prior to merger, where the lower Northern Line trains from Epping continue onto the upper Northern Line trains at Chatswood into Hornsby via Macquarie University.\n\nIn September 2018, the Epping to Chatswood line closed in order to be converted to metro standards as part of the Sydney Metro Northwest project. As a result, the traditional Northern line branch from Hornsby to Central via Strathfield was reinstated.\n\nOn 28 April 2019, as part of the integration with the Sydney Metro Northwest, the Northern Line branch was spun off from the T1 Line and became a separate T9 Northern Line. The new line runs from Hornsby, Epping, Strathfield, Central, Chatswood before terminating at Gordon. The separated line runs a similar route to the pre-2009 incarnation of the line, with an extension into Gordon. It is also similarly colour coded red.\n\nThe line begins at Hornsby - a junction station with the North Shore Line. The line heads south to Strathfield via Epping using the Main North Line, crossing the Parramatta River between Rhodes and Meadowbank. At Strathfield, trains usually head onto a flyover over the 'Main lines', before heading east onto the Main Suburban Railway, usually using the middle 'Suburban' pair of the six tracks between Redfern and Strathfield. Trains pass through Redfern and Central, then through the western limb of the City Circle before heading across the Harbour Bridge. Then trains continue north along the North Shore before terminating at Gordon.\n\nThe following table shows the patronage of Sydney Trains network for the year ending 30 June 2019.\n\n\n"}

The specific cheese referred to depends on the region.\n\nQueso blanco is considered one of the easier cheeses to make, as it requires no careful handling and does not call for rennet or a bacterial culture. It is usually made by heating whole fresh milk to near-boiling, adding an acidifying agent such as vinegar, stirring until curds form, then draining the curds in cheesecloth for three to five hours. Such cheeses are also known as \"bag cheeses\", as the curds are normally hung in a bag of cheesecloth to drain. Many Mexican home cooks make their own instead of purchasing it; when made for the evening meal, it is often prepared in early afternoon and left to drain until evening. As it is highly perishable, it must be refrigerated or used immediately once the whey has drained out.\n\nQueso blanco and queso fresco may be eaten alone or added to other dishes. They are often used as a topping for spicy Mexican dishes such as enchiladas and empanadas, or crumbled over soups or salads. Meltable versions are used to make quesadillas. It is used to make cheesecake in some parts of the world, such as the United States. In Peruvian cuisine, several recipes mix queso fresco and spices to make a spicy cold sauce eaten over peeled boiled potatoes, such as \"papa a la Huancaína\" or \"ocopa\".\n\nA melted cheese appetizer using white American cheese or Monterey Jack is sometimes called \"queso blanco dip,\" but the name is merely descriptive. It does not include queso blanco cheese.\n\nIn Mexican cuisine queso blanco is traditionally made from cow's milk, whereas queso fresco () may be made from a combination of cow's and goat's milk. Some versions of these cheeses, such as Oaxaca cheese, melt well when heated, but most only soften. If it is pressed, and more water is removed, it becomes known as queso seco. Sometimes it is made by pressing the whey from cottage cheese.\n\nIn Brazilian cuisine the cheese is known as ().\n\nIn Dominican Republic cuisine \"queso blanco\" is a firm, salty cheese used for frying: Queso Frito.\n\nIn Nicaraguan cuisine \"queso blanco\" is a firm cheese used for frying: Queso Frito.\n\nIn Portuguese cuisine () refers to a popular mild, soft, creamy, white unaged cheese used throughout the Iberian Peninsula.

It continues to trade as TransACT. Previously, the company was part-owned by Actew Corporation a 50% joint venture partner in ActewAGL (the main energy and water utility company in the Australian Capital Territory).\n\nTransACT was launched in 1996 by a small team comprising Robin Eckermann (Chief Architect), Joe Ceccato, Robert Clarke and Jane Taylor, working under the guidance of ACTEW Executive Neville Smith. The company adopted an Open Access Network (OAN) business model, separating the wholesale and retail businesses.\n\nTransACT operates in collaboration with ten ISPs, comprising a mix of large national organisations and smaller local operations. One of the ISPs (Grapevine) which was previously owned by both TransACT and ActewAGL became a wholly owned subsidiary in March 2010.\n\nThe company has an extensive fibre network in the ACT. SDH, ATM and IP/MPLS Metro Ethernet technologies are used to deliver services via dedicated hubs or gateways that are built around the region. Services are delivered to various businesses, government departments and residential customers via a diverse range of access networks.\n\nAt the end of 2007, the company acquired the regional Victoria telecommunications company Neighbourhood Cable, with its hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) cable networks and customers in three Victorian regional cities of Mildura, Ballarat and Geelong, and rebranded it as TransACT in June 2011.\n\nThe first broadband platform rolled out known as Phase 1 network was based on FTTC (fibre to the curb) design with nodes being placed within 300 metres of premises. SDH backbone is used to transport voice, data and video whereas VDSL technology is used as the access network to get customers connected to TransACT's high-speed broadband and digital TV services. Coincidentally, TransACT also became the first telco in Australia to implement this particular high-speed broadband technology much superior to ADSL, which was prominent throughout the country at that time. TransACT remains as the only telco to support VDSL and the products are still actively sold with network reach-ability to over 55,000 homes in the ACT.\n\nThe Phase 2 rollout involved TransACT placing its own DSLAM equipment within Telstra exchanges and utilising their own fibre-optic backhaul to their main data centre in Dickson, ACT. TransACT completed their ADSL 2/2+ rollout on 1 March 2007. The Phase 2 network is available to anyone outside Phase 1 with a Telstra phone line in Canberra and Queanbeyan, as long as they are within sufficient distance of their telephone exchange – as with any ADSL service.\n\nIn 2009, TransACT commenced a greenfield rollout and upgrade of existing VDSL access network to VDSL2, the most advanced and fastest digital subscriber line (DSL) broadband technology commercially available, commencing with a number of medium- to high-density developments in Canberra's more established suburbs. The upgrade increases broadband speeds by up to four times, compared to the fastest existing ADSL2+ networks used by most carriers. As with the existing VDSL network, VDSL2 products also include triple-play services. By mid-2009, multiples sites including The Avenue on Northbourne Avenue, Skyplaza in Woden and The Gateway at Kingston Foreshore were upgraded to VDSL2 with more projects currently underway.\n\nThe telco is the first in the country to build a dedicated G.984 (GPON) based FTTH or FTTP gateway and also the first provider in Australia to offer broadband services at up to 100 Mbit/s download and 20 Mbit/s upload speeds which were made available on 4 September 2009. The gateway build in the suburb of Forde close to the Gungahlin township trunks back to TransACT's core network in Dickson via a high-bandwidth MPLS backbone. With such infrastructure in place, TransACT is able to offer triple-play services to customers via fibre without the need for any copper in the path, thus enabling higher bit-rates. Similar PON technology and network hierarchy has been chosen by NBNco Limited, the company established in 2009 to design, build and operate the National Broadband Network\n\nAs of end of 2009, five new greenfield suburbs, namely Forde, Franklin, Crace, Casey, Bonner, some parts of Kingston and the Flemington road corridor, were all wired up for this next-generation technology with many new suburbs expected to come on board in the ACT region. As of mid-2010, the total number of premises passed through had reached almost 11,000.\n\nTransACT also offers a range of wholesale services to business and ISP customers, including Colocation, IP transit, peering, data centre services, VPN, managed services, point-to-point and point-to-multipoint services including VPWS and VPLS services of up to 1 Gbit/s for customers anywhere on their network.\n\nIn July 2010, they launched the 'eHub', Australia's first commercial IPTV product bundled with a set-top box capable of handling high-definition video with an onboard personal video recorder.\n\nTransACT is the naming rights sponsor of the TransACT Canberra Capitals, a Canberra team competing in the Women's National Basketball League (WNBL) from October to February each year.\nTransACT first sponsored the Capitals in 2000, when the new company was looking for a community partner.\n\nIn November 2011, iiNet confirmed plans to acquire TransACT for $60m. At the time TransACT had about 40,000 customers throughout the ACT, Queanbeyan and regional Victoria, across the residential, business and government sectors, and had \"total recurring annual revenue\" of about $80 million and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $17 million. It was also reported that the TransACT network consisted of 4,500 kilometres of broadband and 40,000 customers, including 50 lucrative contracts with government departments, that had cost $280 million to build over 10 years.\n\nGrapevine is an internet service provider based in Canberra, Australia, wholly owned by TransACT. It provides dial-up and broadband ISP services, delivered across the TransACT fibre-optic broadband network.\n\nThe company had its beginning in ActewAGL Net Connect, a wholly owned subsidiary of ActewAGL, that started in 2003. In April 2005, it was relaunched as Grapevine that was jointly owned by ActewAGL, the main utility company in the region, and TransACT until May 2010 when ActewAGL sold its share of Grapevine to TransACT.\n\nTransACT defines a virtual channel order that groups channels by their content.\n\nChannels include Channelvision, Prime7, Channel Nine, WIN Television, Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Cartoon Network, Boomerang, MTV, MTV Dance, E!, Fashion TV, National Geographic Channel, Nat Geo People, Animal Planet, DMAX, TLC, Discovery Home and Health, Discovery Science, ESPN, Eurosport, Eurosportnews, BeIN Sports, TCM, CNN, BBC World News, CNBC, Bloomberg TV Australia, Channel NewsAsia, euronews, CCTV News, Al Jazeera, euronews, CCTV-4, Zee TV, Zee News, Zee Cinema, Wion Tv, Federal Parliament – House Of Representatives, Federal Parliament – Senate, Federal Parliament – Committees, EWTN, Australian Christian Channel, ERT World, RTPi, TV5Monde, Deutsche Welle TV, ABC On Demand, Movies On Demand, Sports On Demand, Docos On Demand, Luxury On Demand and AdultShop On Demand.\n\n\n"}

It was written by Gordon J. Key and published by The Fourth Dimension. Instead of featuring a Ferrari as the player's vehicle (as in \"Out Run\"), the game features a blue Jaguar E-type.\n\nIn addition to the game a separate track designer was released which allows players to make and save their own tracks. A pack of extra tracks entitled \"The Extra 100 Miles\" was also available.\n\nThe objective of \"E-Type\" is to cover as much distance as possible in the given time limit over various stages, avoiding static obstacles such as roadworks, oil slicks, trees and postboxes. If the car hits such an object both the driver and his blonde female passenger are thrown upwards from their seats, with the car's wheels falling off on their landing. The car is then automatically reset and moved to the centre of the road for the player to restart. Additionally, other cars can also be seen driving along the roads and need to be avoided - collisions here also add damage the car.\n\nWhen the car has had too many hits, the passengers fall into their seats and the car's bumper falls off, meaning that the game is over. On parts of some tracks, the road is surrounded by water - if the car drives onto the water, it will submerge and the game is over.\n\nThe player can earn extra time for a stage by driving under a Time Bonus banner (to the sound of a bell) or by running a policeman over. The stages can be played at individually or as a set, with the player needing to complete a stage in order to progress. Players who get the best distances are able to enter their names into the \"Hall of Fame\" hi-score table.\n\nOn the Archimedes version, the player takes control of the car using the mouse. The three Acorn mouse buttons represent (from left) the Clutch, Brake and Accelerator. This adds to the \"realism\" of the game as this corresponds to the typical layout of the car's foot pedals. Definable keyboard keys were used for gear changes (in Manual gearbox mode).\n\nThe version for the BBC is controlled by the keyboard, with the player given the option to redefine the keys once the title screen is shown. The Automatic gearbox mode is omitted so the player must change gears manually with the defined keys.\n\nThe \"E-Type Compendium\" later combined the original game with the track designer and \"The Extra 100 Miles\" track collection.\n\n\"E-Type 2\" was released in 1994 and contained a few additions to the original, including a 2-player split-screen mode.

{"id": "1948944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1948944", "title": "Law of Australia", "text": "Law of Australia\n\nThe law of Australia comprises many levels of codified and uncodified forms of law. These include the Australian Constitution, legislation enacted by the Federal Parliament and the parliaments of the states and territories of Australia, regulations promulgated by the Executive, and the common law of Australia arising from the decisions of judges.\n\nThe Australian Constitution is the legal foundation of the Commonwealth of Australia and sets out a federal system of government, dividing power between the federal Government and the States and territories, each of which are separate jurisdictions and have their own system of courts and parliaments. The constitutional framework of Australia is a combination of elements of the Westminster and United States systems of government. The federal legislature has the power to pass laws with respect to a number of express areas, which apply to the whole of Australia and override any State laws to the extent of any inconsistency. However, beyond those express areas the States’ legislatures generally have plenary power to enact laws on any subject.\n\nAt both the federal and State levels, the substantive law of Australia is largely derived from the common law system of English law.\n\nThe High Court of Australia is the highest court in Australia, and hears appeals from federal and State courts on matters of both federal and State law. Unlike the United States, there is only one common law of Australia rather than common laws for each of the several jurisdictions of the states and territories.\n\nThe legal institutions and traditions of Australian law are monocultural in character, reflecting its English origins. When the British arrived in Australia, they considered the continent to be \"terra nullius\", or land belonging to no-one, on the basis that the Aboriginal peoples already inhabiting the continent were not cohesively organised for a treaty to be struck with any single representation of their peoples. Under the English conception of international law at the time, when uninhabited lands were settled by English subjects the laws of England immediately applied to the settled lands. As such, Aboriginal laws and customs, including native title to land, were not recognised. The reception of English law was clarified by the \"Australian Courts Act 1828\" (UK), which provided that all laws and statutes in force in England at the date of enactment should be applied in the courts of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) so far as those laws were applicable. Since Queensland and Victoria were originally part of New South Wales, the same date applies in those States for the reception of English law. South Australia adopted a different date for reception, as did Western Australia.\n\nThe earliest civil and criminal courts established from the beginnings of the colony of New South Wales were rudimentary, adaptive and military in character. Although legality was not always observed, the courts limited the powers of the Governor, and the law of the colony was at times more egalitarian than in Britain.\n\nBy 1824, a court system based in essence on the English model had been established through Acts of the British Parliament. The \"New South Wales Act\" 1823 provided for the establishment of a Supreme Court with the power to deal with all criminal and civil matters \"as fully and amply as Her Majesty's Court of King's Bench, Common Pleas and Exchequer at Westminster\". Inferior courts were also established, including courts of General or Quarter Sessions, and Courts of Requests.\n\nRepresentative government emerged in the 1840s and 1850s, and a considerable measure of autonomy was given to local legislatures in the second half of the nineteenth century. Colonial Parliaments introduced certain reforms such as secret ballots and female suffrage, which were not to occur in Britain until many years later. Nevertheless, Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament extending to the colonies could override contrary colonial legislation and would apply by \"paramount force\". New doctrines of English common law continued to be treated as representing the common law of Australia. For example, the doctrine of the famous case of \"Donoghue v Stevenson\" from which the modern negligence law derived, was treated as being latent already within the common law at the time of reception.\n\nFollowing a number of constitutional conventions during the 1890s to develop a federal nation from the several colonies, the \"Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act\" (UK) was passed and came into force on 1 January 1901. Thus, although a British statute, this became Australia's Constitution.\n\nFollowing federation, Britain's role in the government of Australia became increasingly nominal in the 20th century. However, there was little momentum for Australia to obtain legislative independence. The Australian States did not participate in the conferences leading up to the \"Statute of Westminster\" 1931, which provided that no British Act should be deemed to extend to the dominions without the consent of the dominion. The Australian Government did not invoke the provisions of the statute until 1942. The High Court also followed the decisions of the Privy Council during the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nComplete legislative independence was finally established by the \"Australia Act 1986\", passed by the United Kingdom Parliament. It removed the possibility of legislation being enacted at the consent and request of a dominion, and applied to the States as well as the Commonwealth. It also provided for the complete abolition of appeals to the Privy Council from any Australian court. The Australia Act represented an important symbolic break with Britain, emphasised by Queen Elizabeth II's visit to Australia to sign the legislation in her legally distinct capacity as the Queen of Australia.\n\nLegislative independence has been paralleled by a growing divergence between Australian and English common law in the last quarter of the 20th century. In addition, a large body of English law received in Australia has been progressively repealed in state parliaments, such as in New South Wales by the \"Imperial Acts Application Act 1969\".\n\nAustralian Republicanism emerged as a movement in the 1990s, which aims eventually to change Australia's status as a constitutional monarchy to a republican form of government.\n\nDiscussion of the sources of Australian law is complicated by the federal structure, which creates two sources of written constitutional law: state and federal—and two sources of general statute law, with the federal Constitution determining the validity of State and federal statutes in cases where the two jurisdictions might overlap.\n\nThe Australian colonies became a federation in 1901 through the passing of the \"Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act\" by the British Parliament. The federal constitution was the product of nearly ten years of discussion, \"with roots in both the British legal tradition and Australian democracy\".\n\nThe Constitution provided for the legislative power of the Commonwealth to be vested in a federal Parliament consisting of the Queen, a Senate and a House of Representatives. The role of the Queen in the legislative process lies in her responsibility to grant Royal Assent, a power exercised on her behalf by the Governor-General. The Queen has the highest role in the Assent to legislation in contemporary Australia. Without the Royal Assent there can be no law created or amended within the dominion of the Commonwealth of Australia and its States and Territories.\n\nThe legislative powers of the federal Parliament are limited to those set out under an enumerated list of subject matters in section 51 of the Constitution. These powers include a power to legislate on matters \"incidental\" to the other powers, similar to the United States necessary and proper clause. The Parliament of the Commonwealth can also legislate on matters referred to it by the Parliament of one or more States. In contrast, with a few exceptions the State legislatures generally have plenary power to enact laws on any subject. However, federal laws prevail over State laws where there is any inconsistency. The High Court of Australia has jurisdiction to determine disputes about whether a law is within power and consistent with the Constitution.\n\nChapter III of the Constitution required the creation of the High Court and confers power to establish other federal courts and to vest federal jurisdiction in State courts.\n\nAustralian courts could permit an appeal to the Privy Council on constitutional matters. The right of appeal from the High Court to the Privy Council was only abolished in 1975, and from State courts in 1986.\n\nAustralia does not have a constitutional bill of rights and there are few express rights guaranteed by the Constitution. However, certain indirect protections have been recognised by implication or as a consequence of other constitutional principles. For example, there is an implied guarantee of freedom of political communication. Additionally, rights are protected indirectly through the separation of powers, which requires courts to be sufficiently independent and impartial from the other branches of government. Human rights in Australia are generally protected through statutes and the common law.\n\nIf the government agrees that the changes are worthwhile, a Bill is drafted, usually by Parliamentary Counsel. The Bill is read and debated in both houses of parliament before it is either rejected, changed, or approved. An approved Bill must then receive the assent then handed down to either the Governor (State) or the Governor-General (Commonwealth). Parliament often delegates legislation to local councils, statutory authorities and government departments, for sub or minor statute laws or rules such as Road Rules, but all law is answerable to the Commonwealth Constitution.\n\nMost statutes are meant to be applied in the main not by legal practitioners and judges but by administrative decision makers. Certain laws receive more judicial interpretation than others, either because more is at stake or because those who are affected are in a position to take the matter to court. Whilst the meanings presented to the court are often those that benefit the litigants themselves, the courts are not bound to select one of the interpretations offered by the parties.\n\nAustralian courts have departed from the traditional approach of interpreting statutes (the literal rule, the golden rule, and the mischief rule). The dominant approach is that rules are not to be applied rigidly because the overriding goal is to interpret the statute in accordance with the intentions of Parliament. This so-called \"purposive approach\" has been reinforced by statute. Legislation in all States and Territories allows recourse to extrinsic materials.\n\nIn each Australian state, including the Commonwealth and the Australian Capital Territory, there is an official compilation of all new laws enacted by the Parliaments in such states. The Western Australian Consolidated Acts, Northern Territory Consolidated Acts, Queensland Consolidated Acts, South Australian Current Acts, New South Wales Consolidated Acts, Victorian Consolidated Acts, and the Tasmanian Consolidated Acts are the official compilation of laws and statutes in such Australian states. They contain statutes, Acts of Parliament, criminal law and many major topic areas. They are all enacted in chronological order and are normally enacted in statute. \n\nThe Commonwealth of Australia Consolidated Acts are all of the federal statutes and laws, including federal criminal law, enacted by the Parliament of Australia. The Australian Capital Territory Consolidated Acts are all of the enacted laws and statutes of the Australian Capital Territory that are enacted by the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly.\n\n\"Common law\" in Australia, like in other former British colonies, is the body of law developed from thirteenth century England to the present day, as case law or precedent, by judges, courts, and tribunals. However, after over a century of federation, there is a substantial divergence between English and Australian common law.\n\nThe High Court of Australia has a general appellate jurisdiction from the State Supreme Courts per s 73(ii) of the \"Australian Constitution\". The High Court's appellate jurisdiction ensures a uniform Australian common law. The High Court also has original jurisdiction for matters in s 75 of the \"Australian Constitution.\"\n\nUntil 1963, the High Court regarded decisions of the House of Lords binding, and there was substantial uniformity between Australian and English common law. In 1978, the High Court declared that it was no longer bound by decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\n\nA bilateral treaty (between two nations) or a multilateral treaty (among more than two nations, or organised by an International body) can be a source of Australian law. Australia has entered into a substantial number of treaties. Although treaties can legally be entered into by the executive government of the day (not necessarily Parliament), in practice treaties are tabled in both houses of Parliament 15 days prior to signing. They are generally organised and administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who advise \"The general position under Australian law is that treaties which Australia has joined, apart from those terminating a state of war, are not directly and automatically incorporated into Australian law. Signature and ratification do not, of themselves, make treaties operate domestically. In the absence of legislation, treaties cannot impose obligations on individuals nor create rights in domestic law. Nevertheless, international law, including treaty law, is a legitimate and important influence on the development of the common law and may be used in the interpretation of statutes.\" Treaties can be implemented through executive action, and often existing laws are sufficient to ensure a treaty is honoured.\n\nThe main substantive areas of law in Australia include: \n\n\n"}

He won the 1998 British Touring Car Championship, the 2011 Scandinavian Touring Car Championship, and has also been a frontrunner in the European/World Touring Car Championship.\n\nRydell was born in Vallentuna, Stockholm. Initially he trained to be an accountant at AB Rydell, his family's flower boutique business, but was bitten by the racing bug. In the early 1990s, he raced in various Formula Three series. He also won pole position in the 1991 Macau Grand Prix, and won the 1992 race. He competed in Japanese F3 in 1992 and 1993, British F3 in 1989 and 1991, and the Swedish F3 series in 1987 and 1988. In 1990, he raced in F3000. In 1984–1985, he won the Swedish 100cc go kart championship.\n\nHis first year in the BTCC was 1994, when his car was quite distinctive, driving a Volvo 850 Estate, when it was normal to race saloons. The TWR team switched to a saloon in 1995 and Rydell took pole for 13 of the 24 races, but due to several slow starts he won only 4 times and he finished on podium 7 times. At the end of the year he was third in the championship, a result repeated in 1996 although Audi dominated with Frank Biela he was able to score 4 victories and 6 podium. In 1997 Volvo switch from 850 saloon to new model Volvo S40, at the end of year he was fourth with 1 victory and 5 podium. In 1998, he finally won the BTCC title in a Volvo with 5 victories and 12 podium, beating Anthony Reid at the final meeting. He also won the 1998 Super Touring Bathurst 1000, sharing a Volvo S40 with Jim Richards.\nIn 1999 he was again third behind the two Nissan Primera with 4 victories and 7 podium. \n\nAfter five years with Volvo, he was loaned to Ford (Prodrive) for 2000 where he will finish for the fourth time in seven years third behind his two team mate Alain Menu and Anthony Reid.\n\nHe spent 2001 largely waiting for his ETCC Volvo S60 to be built, but he raced a Ferrari 550 Maranello in the FIA GT Championship for the Prodrive team. In 2002 he raced in the ETCC finishing 5th with 8 podium while in 2003, without official Volvo's support, he finished just 11th with only 2 podiums.\n\nHe moved to SEAT's SEAT Sport team in 2004 for the ETCC driving Seat Toledo Cupra ending 10th with 1 victory and 1 podium. In 2004 he also took part in two races in the Swedish Touring Car Championship, claiming one victory.\n\nSEAT and Rydell continued in the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) when it replaced the ETCC for 2005. He finished sixth in the championship, winning race two at Silverstone and 4 podium.\n\nHe continued with SEAT for 2006, finishing seventh, with just 4 podium.\n\nRydell lost his SEAT drive for 2007, and instead drove an Aston Martin DBR9 with the Prodrive team in the GT Championship having previously worked with the team when using Ferrari's in 2004.\n\nRydell raced in the 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans with David Brabham and Darren Turner and they won in the GT1 class.\n\nOn the WTCC weekend in Anderstorp, Sweden, Rydell returned to the category as a fourth driver for the Chevrolet team and a local hero guest driver. He won the second race of the day, ahead of team-mates Nicola Larini and Alain Menu ignoring the team order to don't attack their team mate in particular Larini who was fighting for the title championship and losing the opportunity to continue with RML until the end of the season.\n\nPrior to the last event of the 2007 WTCC calendar in Macau, Rydell was chosen by the SEAT Sport team to race for them as an additional driver to help the team take home at least one of the main championships, either the Driver's championship via SEAT's Yvan Muller winning, or the Manufacturer's championship. The weekend though did not set off as planned, due to Rickard starting 14th on the race 1 grid and Yvan Muller started 2nd behind the eventual winner of the first race Alain Menu in the RML run Chevrolet. Rickard finished 11th in the first race with Yvan Muller leading 8 of the 9 laps of the race, but due to a fuel pressure problem Muller's race weekend ended on the 8th lap even before he was able to get to the pits. During the second race Rickard had a much better race than the first as he finished in 6th, but unfortunately his efforts were not enough to help SEAT clinch the Manufacturer's crowns, as the championship went to the reigning Manufacturer's champions BMW.\n\nRydell was re-signed by SEAT as one of their drivers in their five strong driver line up for an assault on the 2008 WTCC season. Rickard finished fifth in the final standings, winning once at Estoril and once at Okayama.\n\nRickard raced for SEAT yet again in 2009, winning at Puebla and finishing seventh overall in the final standings.\n\nRickard Rydell returns to racing after a year as a commentator of the STCC for Swedish TV. He was signed to Chevrolet Motorsport Sweden team with the Cruze joining as team with his teammate Viktor Hallrup a developmental driver for the team in his second season with the team, with first season being with the Lacetti. Rickard came in as a booster driver for Cheverolet Sweden to gain results for the team as their developmental driver was still not up to speed with the top runners. Rickard won the title* at the last race of the season at Mantorp by just 2 points to Frederik Ekblom.\n\n\nThe two pieces of evidence that Volkswagen Team Biogas.se brought in: \nPhoto and Video, both illustrated on touringcartimes.com\n\nThis is Rydell Second National Touring car title after the BTCC championship in 1998, although he won the Bathurst 1000 that year also which was his last touring car title before his return to form in 2011.\n\nNext year he will be defending his STCC title however, Frederik Ekblom will not be contesting in the STCC as he has signed with Volvo Polestar in the silhouette touring car championship run by the TTA which is based on a Volvo C30 chassis and many teams and successful Swedish drivers, i.e. Jan \"Flash\" Nilsson and Richard Göransson , who were STCC BMW drivers in the 2011 season.\n\nRydell joined NIKA Racing for the 2013 FIA WTCC Race of China to drive their Chevrolet Cruze 1.6T.\n\nIn a 2005 poll run by Motorsport Magazine, Rydell was voted 18th greatest touring car driver of all time.\n\nRydell announced his retirement from motorsport in early 2016.\n\n"}

They released their first album after Raymund Ryan Santes, a station manager of 93.9 iFm (Manila), watched one of their gigs and contacted a producer for their 2003 debut album, \"Soulful Acoustic\", which has since been certified Platinum.\n\nIn 2005, M.Y.M.P. released their second album titled \"Beyond Acoustic\" and third album \"Versions\" through Ivory Music. The success of the two albums prompted the re-release of their second and third albums in a two-disc set the same year. In 2006, they released their fourth album, \"New Horizon\" and DVD of their concert at the Music Museum. In 2008, M.Y.M.P. released their last album on Ivory Music, titled \"Now\". The group then signed with Star Music.\n\nJacques \"Chin\" Alcantara founded the band in late 1996. It was Chin's elder brother, Julius, who gave the band its name as a tribute to their departed mother, cardiologist Dr. Stella Lopez-Alcantara, who died of complications from breast cancer.\n\nBack when it was originally formed, Make Your Momma Proud was a four-man rock band whose arsenal included Jimi Hendrix, The Doors and, as Alcantara adds, a little Mr. Big. He was still a student at Miriam College then, taking up Communication Arts, major in Advertising. \"My mom played the piano but she didn’t get to see me play professionally—she did get to see me start out\", Alcantara said. In the year after his mother died, Alcantara took up the guitar and, in his words, \"really got obsessed with it and that’s when I knew what I wanted to be a musician.\" Alcantara was persuaded by his father to attend classical guitar tutoring, but he stopped after a month.\n\nThe peak of M.Y.M.P.'s amateur days was when they won the 1996 national championship of the San Miguel Beer Battle of Bands. Before that, the group had won the NCR championship, best vocalist and best lead guitarist.\n\nAs a college band, M.Y.M.P. appeared in college fairs and shows, but then they encountered difficulty in lining up gigs due to their \"disciplined rock\" repertoire. M.Y.M.P. added a keyboardist and began working on a more pop sound, completing the transformation with the addition in 2000 of a female vocalist, Marifil Niña Girado, now known as Nina. She left the band to go solo. M.Y.M.P. then performed in bars, clubs and shows for years, building an identity.\n\nIn 2001, Alcantara handled an audition for a new female lead, and the group found Julie Iris \"Juris\" Fernandez. Originally from Davao, Fernandez explains she didn't grow up exposed to music on a regular basis. Like Alcantara, Fernandez did not have formal lessons in music, eschewing the training to learn on her own. After graduating from Miriam College, Juris Fernandez was studying at the Ateneo, working towards completing her pre-med requirements when she decided that, like Alcantara, she wanted to immerse herself in music. After singing with Jimmy Bondoc, she auditioned for M.Y.M.P.\n\nIt was the trio of Alcantara, Fernandez and percussionist Mike Manahan that established the beachhead for M.Y.M.P.’s frontal assault on the sales and radio charts.\n\nTheir recording career started when Raymond Ryan, the station manager of iFM, watched their gig. Ryan met with a producer to produce their debut album, \"Soulful Acoustic\". Ivory Records then became their recording company. M.Y.M.P.'s debut album was released on Ivory Music and Video's 20th anniversary. The band became famous with their original hit song \"A Little Bit\" (which won the People's Choice \"Favorite Song\" Award in Awit Awards 2004) and cover versions of Sting's \"Every Little Thing\" and Bob Marley's \"Waiting in Vain\".\n\nThe trio did click but M.Y.M.P. became a duo when one of their members decided to leave the group. Manahan left the band in 2003 due to what Alcantara called “professional differences” as well as a fallout from Manahan's breakup with Fernandez; the two were in a relationship for a while. Yet, this did not stop M.Y.M.P.'s Juris & Chin from sharing their music.\n\nThe duo enjoyed their ride in the Philippine music scene as a new and improved M.Y.M.P. had emerged, a quartet together with Andrew and John as bassist and kahonista, respectively, as two more albums were released in a year. \"Beyond Acoustic\" and \"Versions\", both 12-track albums, were declared certified Gold after less than a month.\n\nTheir original hit song \"Get Me\", and covers \"Tell Me Where It Hurts\", \"Kailan\", \"Especially for You\" and \"Eternal Flame\", were later used as theme songs for TV series and commercial ads.\n\nOn October 1, 2005, M.Y.M.P. had their first major concert at the Music Museum, titled 'Especially For You'. The success of the concert prompted the band to have another concert at the Araneta Coliseum on November 18, 2005, and its repeat on February 3, 2006. Both concerts were sold-out, with each concert having more than 10,000 audience capacity.\n\nIn 2006, they released a DVD of their concert at the Music Museum.\n\nNow backed by keyboardist Edward \"Oja\" Jimenez, percussionist Dexter John Angeles and bassist Aimiel Rivas, M.Y.M.P. embarked on its most ambitious career step yet: a summer tour of the US West and East Coasts, a development that excited Alcantara and Fernandez immensely.\n\nThe group released the album \"New Horizon\" in 2006.\n\nIn 2008, M.Y.M.P. ended their contract with Ivory Music and signed a deal with Star Music, and released their last album with Ivory Music, \"Now\".\n\nM.Y.M.P. ended 2008 with two other bands in the Philippine music scene, Side A and Freestyle and took center stage at the Back2Back2Back concert at the Araneta Coliseum on December 1.\n\nIn 2009, M.Y.M.P. were regularly seen every Sunday on \"ASAP\"'s \"Sessionistas\" segment together with Soul Siren Nina, crooner Richard Poon, bossa artist Sitti Navarro, ex-Southborder vocalist Duncan Ramos and singer Aiza Seguerra.\n\nSometime in mid-2009, speculations about Fernandez and Alcantara having issues caught some media attention when Alcantara silently pulled out from a segment of ABS-CBN's Sunday variety show \"ASAP\" called \"Sessionistas\", leaving only Fernandez giving solo performances. The rumors intensified when the band failed to attend the first-ever Philippine Movie Press Club Music Awards in which the group won for Best Duo/Group.\n\nThe group had been silent until an official announcement they released at the \"Manila Bulletin Entertainment\" on November 5, 2009, confirming that Juris Fernandez was leaving M.Y.M.P. They said in the statement that they are parting ways due to \"irreconcilable professional differences\". However, since they were working on an album when the breakup happened, they also said they would work together to finish the five songs that they had already recorded, although the outcome will not be released as M.Y.M.P's, but as Fernandez's solo album with Alcantara as the producer.\n\nOn January 24, 2010, Juliet Bahala was introduced as the new vocalist of M.Y.M.P. on \"ASAP\". Bahala, then an 18-year-old regional singing champ, hailed from Davao where Juris Fernandez also came from. She sang on M.Y.M.P.'s sixth album \"The Unreleased Acoustic Collection\" which was released in May 2011. During the promotion of the album, Bahala suffered severe vocal fatigue, laryngitis and vocal nodules which eventually forced her to rest indefinitely. She is now back in her Davao hometown pursuing her classical roots. \n\nIn the last quarter of 2018, MYMP management held a grand audition for a new female vocalist. And after almost a year, with numerous applicants, and a number of potentials, they chose Carmella Ravanilla. Carmella, also a Miriam graduate, is a former contender in a popular reality singing contest, bested 10 other hopefuls for the coveted lead vocalist spot. 2018 also marked the year when MYMP returned to its original label, Ivory Music. And they released a new single \"WISHES AND DREAMS\" after almost 6 years. The band is under the management of Maria Teresa Alcantara (Tere).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It published a cover photo of Kardashian holding her son, Mason, and claimed to feature an exclusive interview revealing the secrets to her weight loss. Kardashian tweeted in response, \"One of those weeklies got it wrong again…they didn’t have an exclusive with me.

The front cover of the 30 July issue advertised \"Kate's Post-Baby Weight Loss Regime\" and an \"exclusive interview\" with Middleton's trainer, who claimed that \"[Kate's] stomach will shrink straight back\" to its previous size. The story sparked backlash on Twitter when English TV presenter Katy Hill tweeted a photo of her own postnatal body and urged fellow mothers to boycott the magazine. Hill gained support from other women who believed that the story had been posted too soon after Middleton gave birth and felt that \"OK!\" was \"pressuring new moms to instantly lose the baby weight.\" The magazine's parent company, Northern & Shell, later issued an apology in a statement published in \"The Guardian\": \"Kate is one of the great beauties of our age and \"OK!\" readers love her.

She is credited with leading the campaign that saved the San Francisco cable car system in the 1940s and 1950s, and the foundation of the San Francisco Beautiful organization in 1947.\n\nIn 1947, Mayor of San Francisco Roger Lapham proposed the closure of the two Powell Street cable car lines, which were owned by the city as part of the San Francisco Municipal Railway. In response to a joint meeting of 27 women's civic groups, led by Friedel Klussmann, formed the \"Citizens' Committee to Save the Cable Cars\". In a famous battle of wills, the citizen's committee eventually forced a referendum on an amendment to the city charter, compelling the city to continue operating the Powell Street lines. This passed overwhelmingly with 166,989 yes votes to 51,457 no votes.\n\nIn 1951, the three cable car lines owned by the private California Street Cable Railroad (Cal Cable) were shut down when the company was unable to afford insurance. The city purchased and re-opened the lines in 1952, but the amendment to the city charter did not protect these lines, and the city proceeded with plans to replace them with buses. Again Mrs Klussmann came to the rescue, but with less success this time. The result was a compromise protected system made up of the California Street line from Cal Cable, the Powell-Mason line already in municipal ownership, and a third hybrid line made up by grafting the Hyde Street section of Cal Cable's O'Farrell, Jones & Hyde line onto a truncated Powell-Washington-Jackson line (now known as the Powell-Hyde line).\n\nWhen Klussmann died at the age of 90 in 1986, the cable cars were decorated in black in her memory. In 1997, the city dedicated the turntable at the outer terminal of the Powell-Hyde line to Klussmann.\n\n"}

{"id": "1949009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949009", "title": "Heat capacity ratio", "text": "Heat capacity ratio\n\nIn thermal physics and thermodynamics, the heat capacity ratio, also known as the adiabatic index, the ratio of specific heats, or Laplace's coefficient, is the ratio of the heat capacity at constant pressure () to heat capacity at constant volume (). It is sometimes also known as the \"isentropic expansion factor\" and is denoted by (gamma) for an ideal gas or (kappa), the isentropic exponent for a real gas. The symbol gamma is used by aerospace and chemical engineers.\n\nwhere is the heat capacity, formula_2 the molar heat capacity (heat capacity per mol of a gas) and the specific heat capacity (heat capacity per unit mass) of a gas. The suffixes and refer to constant pressure and constant volume conditions respectively.\n\nThe heat capacity ratio is important for its applications in thermodynamical reversible processes, especially involving ideal gases; the speed of sound depends on that factor.\n\nTo understand this relation, consider the following thought experiment. A closed pneumatic cylinder contains air. The piston is locked. The pressure inside is equal to atmospheric pressure. This cylinder is heated to a certain target temperature. Since the piston cannot move, the volume is constant. The temperature and pressure will rise. When the target temperature is reached, the heating is stopped. The amount of energy added equals , with representing the change in temperature. The piston is now freed and moves outwards, stopping as the pressure inside the chamber reaches atmospheric pressure. We assume the expansion occurs without exchange of heat (adiabatic expansion). Doing this work, air inside the cylinder will cool to below the target temperature. To return to the target temperature (still with a free piston), the air must be heated, but is no longer under constant volume, since the piston is free to move as the gas is reheated. This extra heat amounts to about 40% more than the previous amount added. In this example, the amount of heat added with a locked piston is proportional to , whereas the total amount of heat added is proportional to . Therefore, the heat capacity ratio in this example is 1.4.\n\nAnother way of understanding the difference between and is that applies if work is done to the system, which causes a change in volume (such as by moving a piston so as to compress the contents of a cylinder), or if work is done by the system, which changes its temperature (such as heating the gas in a cylinder to cause a piston to move). applies only if – that is, the work done – is zero. Consider the difference between adding heat to the gas with a locked piston and adding heat with a piston free to move, so that pressure remains constant. In the second case, the gas will both heat and expand, causing the piston to do mechanical work on the atmosphere. The heat that is added to the gas goes only partly into heating the gas, while the rest is transformed into the mechanical work performed by the piston. In the first, constant-volume case (locked piston) there is no external motion, and thus no mechanical work is done on the atmosphere; is used. In the second case, additional work is done as the volume changes, so the amount of heat required to raise the gas temperature (the specific heat capacity) is higher for this constant pressure case.\n\nFor an ideal gas, the heat capacity is constant with temperature. Accordingly, we can express the enthalpy as and the internal energy as . Thus, it can also be said that the heat capacity ratio is the ratio between the enthalpy to the internal energy:\n\nFurthermore, the heat capacities can be expressed in terms of heat capacity ratio () and the gas constant ():\n\nwhere is the amount of substance in moles.\n\nMayer's relation allows to deduce the value of from the more commonly tabulated value of :\n\nThe heat capacity ratio () for an ideal gas can be related to the degrees of freedom () of a molecule by\n\nThus we observe that for a monatomic gas, with 3 degrees of freedom:\n\nwhile for a diatomic gas, with 5 degrees of freedom (at room temperature: 3 translational and 2 rotational degrees of freedom; the vibrational degree of freedom is not involved, except at high temperatures):\n\nFor example, the terrestrial air is primarily made up of diatomic gases (around 78% nitrogen, N, and 21% oxygen, O), and at standard conditions it can be considered to be an ideal gas. The above value of 1.4 is highly consistent with the measured adiabatic indices for dry air within a temperature range of 0–200 °C, exhibiting a deviation of only 0.2% (see tabulation above).\n\nAs temperature increases, higher-energy rotational and vibrational states become accessible to molecular gases, thus increasing the number of degrees of freedom and lowering . For a real gas, both and increase with increasing temperature, while continuing to differ from each other by a fixed constant (as above, ), which reflects the relatively constant difference in work done during expansion for constant pressure vs. constant volume conditions. Thus, the ratio of the two values, , decreases with increasing temperature. For more information on mechanisms for storing heat in gases, see the gas section of specific heat capacity. While at 273 K (0 °C), Monatomic gases such as the noble gases He, Ne, and Ar all have the same value of , that being 1.664. However, once you start getting in to diatomic gases and gas compounds, the values for change quite often.\n\nValues based on approximations (particularly ) are in many cases not sufficiently accurate for practical engineering calculations, such as flow rates through pipes and valves. An experimental value should be used rather than one based on this approximation, where possible. A rigorous value for the ratio can also be calculated by determining from the residual properties expressed as\n\nValues for are readily available and recorded, but values for need to be determined via relations such as these. See relations between specific heats for the derivation of the thermodynamic relations between the heat capacities.\n\nThe above definition is the approach used to develop rigorous expressions from equations of state (such as Peng–Robinson), which match experimental values so closely that there is little need to develop a database of ratios or values. Values can also be determined through finite-difference approximation.\n\nThis ratio gives the important relation for an isentropic (quasistatic, reversible, adiabatic process) process of a simple compressible calorically-perfect ideal gas:\n\nUsing the ideal gas law, formula_11:\n\nwhere is pressure in Pa, is the volume of the gas in formula_14 and is the temperature in K.\n\nIn gas dynamics we are interested in the local relations between pressure, density and temperature, rather than considering a fixed quantity of gas. By considering the density formula_15 as the inverse of the volume for a unit mass, we can take formula_16 in these relations.\nSince for constant entropy, formula_17, we have formula_18, or formula_19, it follows that\nFor an imperfect or non-ideal gas, Chandrasekhar defined three different adiabatic indices so that the adiabatic relations can be written in the same form as above; these are used in the theory of stellar structure:\nAll of these are equal to formula_24 in the case of a perfect gas.\n\n"}

{"id": "1949025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949025", "title": "The Antiquary", "text": "The Antiquary\n\nThe Antiquary (1816) is a novel by Sir Walter Scott about several characters including an antiquary: an amateur historian, archaeologist and collector of items of dubious antiquity. He is the eponymous character and for all practical purposes the hero, though the characters of Lovel and Isabella Wardour provide the conventional love interest. \"The Antiquary\" was Scott's own favourite of his novels, and is one of his most critically well-regarded works; H. J. C. Grierson, for example, wrote that \"Not many, apart from Shakespeare, could write scenes in which truth and poetry, realism and romance, are more wonderfully presented.\"\n\nScott wrote in an advertisement to the novel that his purpose in writing it, similar to that of his novels \"Waverley\" and \"Guy Mannering\", was to document Scottish life of a certain period, in this case the last decade of the 18th century. It is, in short, a novel of manners, and its theme is the influence of the past on the present. In tone it is predominantly comic, though the humour is offset with episodes of melodrama and pathos. \n\nScott included a glossary of Scottish terms as an appendix to the novel.\n\nScott contracted to write \"The Antiquary\" in January 1815 with a publication date of 4 June, but a substantial part of the year was taken up with other commitments, social and literary, the most substantial being his expedition to Belgium and France which resulted in the poems \"The Field of Waterloo\" and 'The Dance of Death' and \"Paul's Letters to His Kinsfolk\". Composition seems to have begun at the end of the year and was complete, apart from the glossary, by mid-April 1816.\n\n\"The Antiquary\" appeared in three volumes in Edinburgh on 4 May 1816 and London on 8 May. As with all the Waverley novels before 1827 publication was anonymous. This first edition of 6000 copies was followed by a revised second edition some three months later. There is no clear evidence for authorial involvement in this, or in any of the novel's subsequent appearances except for the 18mo \"Novels and Tales\" (1823) and the 'Magnum' edition. Some of the small changes to the text in 1823 are attributable to Scott, but that edition was a textual dead end. In October 1828 he provided the novel with an introduction and notes, and revised the text, for the Magnum edition in which it appeared as Volumes 5 and 6 in October and November 1829. The standard modern edition, by David Hewitt, was published as Volume 3 of the Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels in 1995: this is based on the first edition, corrected from the manuscript and incorporating verbal changes introduced in the second edition; the Magnum material appears in Volume 25a.\n\nAt the opening of the story, Lovel meets Oldbuck while taking a coach from Edinburgh. Oldbuck, interested as he is in antiquities, has with him Gordon's \"Itinerarium\", a book about Roman ruins. The book interests Lovel, to the surprise of Oldbuck and by their shared interest the two become friends. Oldbuck invites Lovel to come to Monkbarns and takes the opportunity of a willing listener to divulge his ancient knowledge. In the process of which, Oldbuck shows Lovel a plot of land he purchased at great cost where he found an inscription \"A.D.L.L\", which Oldbuck takes to mean \"\"Agricola Dicavit Libens Lubens\"\". Edie Ochiltree, the local beggar, disputes the antiquary's history, in one of the more amusing scenes of the story (see image at left).\nOldbuck decides to introduce Lovel to his good friend, Sir Arthur Wardour. When Sir Arthur arrives, Lovel meets Arthur's daughter, Isabella and the two realize they have seen each other before. Because Lovel is illegitimate, she knows her father would not approve of a marriage between them. When she sees Lovel standing in the road waiting to talk to her, she convinces her father to take the long way home, walking down to the beach. Luckily, Edie Ochiltree, having the insight that someone may be trapped on the beach not knowing that the tide was coming in, finds the Wardours and helps them escape the rising waters. Then, Lovel appears and gets them to relative safety, huddling on the side of a rocky cliff. Finally, Oldbuck arrives with men and ropes to pull the four up over the cliff to safety.\n\nA while later, Oldbuck takes Lovel, the Wardours, his niece and nephew, Douster-swivel and a priest to the ancient ruins of Saint Ruth on Sir Arthur's property. While exploring the property, they discuss an ancient treasure that they believe to be buried at the ruins. Captain M'Intyre dominates Isabella's attention, which she leaves in favor of Lovel's to the dismay of M'Intyre. M'Intyre, angered at this slight, discovers that Lovel is in the military, but realizes he knows of no one named Lovel in his division and calls him out upon the topic. They agree to a duel and return to the scene to fight for their individual honor. Lovel's bullet strikes best and leaves M'Intyre bleeding on the ground, when Lovel flees with Edie to avoid a potential arrest. In their hiding, Edie and Lovel see Douster-swivel and Sir Arthur return to the ruins, looking for treasure. They see Douster-swivel attempting to convince Sir Arthur of his magical abilities to find gold and he does conveniently find a small bag under a stone. After they leave, Lovel boards a military ship and departs.\n\nOldbuck, understanding Douster-swivel's knavery, confronts him about his cons and takes Sir Arthur back to the ruins to look for treasure without Douster-swivel's magical intervention. Digging further under the same stone under which Douster-swivel had previously found treasure, they discover a chest full of silver, which Sir Arthur promptly takes back home. Edie hangs behind and whispers for Douster-swivel to join him. Then, showing the con artist the lid to the chest, with the phrase \"Search 1\" written on it. Edie convinces the German mage that this phrase means there is a second chest nearby, this time full of gold. They return at night and dig, but cannot find another chest. Just as Douster-swivel is starting to realize that Edie is mocking him, Steenie Mucklebackit jumps from the shadows and knocks Douster-swivel unconscious.\n\nSteenie and Edie flee to Steenie's house, where Steenie shows him Douster-swivel's pocketbook, accidentally picked up during the excitement. Edie makes him promise to return the pocketbook and then leaves. Alas, Steenie is not long for this world and dies in a fishing accident the next day. As the family is in mourning, Elspeth, Steenie's grandmother, comes out of a long senility to tell Edie to take a ring and a message to Lord Glenallan. Oldbuck, whose land the Mucklebackits occupy, comes to help carry the casket and pay his respects, to the awe and thanks of the family.\n\nEdie meets Lord Glenallan and gives him the ring and tells him to go visit Elspeth. Glenallan does and learns from her his own history. He had married a woman named Eveline Neville, who his mother helped convince was his sister after she had already become pregnant. Eveline attempts to commit suicide by jumping into the sea. She is taken from the water barely alive and dies after giving birth. The child is taken by another maid named Theresa and is raised by Glenallen's younger brother as his own illegitimate son. Glenallen does not know this. Glenallan never recovers from believing that he committed a violation of nature. Elspeth tells him that Eveline was not his sister and that his marriage with her was perfectly legitimate. It relieves his mind and he desires to find his son.\n\nMeanwhile, Edie is arrested for attacking Douster-swivel. Oldbuck proves that Douster-swivel is merely a thief and frees Edie, who immediately goes upon a mission. Oldbuck then receives word that Sir Arthur, who has been heavily in debt, is under arrest and has the valuables of his home being taken. Edie returns with money sent by Wardour's son and an order to stop the arrest.\n\nFinally, a mistake causes the national warning system—a series of towers with fires that can be lit to warn of invasion—to be lit and everyone believes the French are invading. Oldbuck dons his sword and travels to town to help with defence along with his nephew, who promptly assumes the role of a commander. As they prepare for the defence, Lord Glenallan comes in with his highland troops. Finally, Lovel and Captain Wardour arrive to take command of the defence and it is revealed that Lovel is actually Major Neville. Further, Oldbuck realizes that Major Neville is Glenallan's son and the two are reunited. Major Neville becomes the next Lord Glenallen and is now free to marry Isabella Wardour.\n\n\"Principal characters in bold\"\n\nVolume One\n\nCh. 1: Two gentlemen, one elderly the other young, travelling independently, take the coach from Edinburgh to South Queensferry.\n\nCh. 2: The narrator provides a sketch of the older man, Jonathan Oldbuck; Oldbuck and young Lovel dine at the Hawes inn and travel on to Fairport.\n\nCh. 3: Oldbuck introduces Lovel to his antiquarian 'sanctum sanctorum' at Monkbarns.\n\nCh. 4: Edie Ochiltree, a licensed beggar, indicates that what Oldbuck takes to be a Roman praetorium is of modern construction.\n\nCh. 5: Oldbuck (a Whig) invites his Tory neighbour Sir Arthur Wardour and his daughter Isabella to meet Lovel at dinner.\n\nCh. 6: After dinner, where Sir Arthur and Oldbuck have an antiquarian dispute, the Wardours choose to walk home by the sands to avoid meeting Lovel again, and Jacob Caxon the barber expresses his concern about their safety.\n\nCh. 7: On the sands Edie warns the Wardours, but it is too late and they are all cut off by the tide.

The figure of Edie Ochiltree attracted particular praise, recalling Meg Merrilees from \"Guy Mannering\" but in a more natural mode. Oldbuck was also generally admired, though \"The European Magazine\" considered him tediously minute. Lovel's disappearance from the action and Isabella Wardour's ineffectiveness were seen as blemishes, and the plot as a whole was often judged ill-conducted, especially the abruptness of the winding up. \"The Monthly Review\", \"The Quarterly Review\", and \"The New Monthly Magazine\" all considered the author's claim to have followed an overall plan in the first three novels to be wisdom after the event.\n\n"}

{"id": "1949029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949029", "title": "Grace Adler", "text": "Grace Adler\n\nGrace Elizabeth Adler (formerly Adler-Markus) is a fictional character in the American sitcom \"Will & Grace\", portrayed by Debra Messing. A Jewish interior designer living in New York City, she lives with her gay best friend, Will Truman (played by Eric McCormack), for a majority of the series. She is also the employer of Karen Walker (Megan Mullally) and the friend and neighbor of Jack McFarland (Sean Hayes).\n\nGrace was born on April 26, 1967, in Schenectady, New York. She has been particularly influenced by her mother, Bobbi (Debbie Reynolds), a flamboyant actress from whom she inherited her many neuroses. Grace also constantly strives for the affection of her father Martin (Alan Arkin then Robert Klein), competing with her two sisters (one younger, one older), who have more obvious problems than she (Joyce, played by Sara Rue, is a compulsive overeater, while Janet, portrayed by Geena Davis then Mary McCormack, is rarely employed and promiscuous). Grace herself is decidedly selfish and neurotic, but this is usually played for laughs, like when her husband Leo asks, \"You want me to be happy, right?\" and she sweetly replies \"Not if it affects me negatively in any way.\" She is also somewhat vain, once declaring herself to be a \"frickin' bombshell\" and believing that she bears a strong resemblance to red-haired celebrities like Rita Hayworth (once even thinking a photo of Hayworth was one of herself) and Nicole Kidman. This, however, leads to her being taken down a peg, and she is usually the butt of numerous jokes by other characters. In one episode, while in Los Angeles, she is repeatedly mistaken for Kathy Griffin by tourists. She is a Democrat and a graduate of Columbia University and the Fashion Institute.\n\nGrace's quirks and physical abnormalities are often fodder for the show's antics. She has very large feet, even for her height, and she's often ridiculed for them. She comments on the fact \"feet the size of canoes\" were the only things her father ever gave her. When Will pulls out a pair of over-sized slippers out of a box of her childhood memorabilia, she remarks \"Those are my ballet slippers from fourth grade! I went from a four to an eight in a month!\" In another episode, she and Will travel to Los Angeles and visit the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and Grace finds that her hands and feet fit perfectly into John Wayne's hand and footprints (\"Was he really tiny, or am I just a monster?\").\n\nThere is a general running joke that she is slovenly and unladylike, which contrasts with Will's fastidiousness, usually for purposes of comedy. She is very cheap and often hoards on free things (such as pretending to have a drinking problem in order to get free food at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings) and even steals. She once mentions selling Will's college term papers for a profit, of which Will had no knowledge.\n\nIn the 10th season episode \"Grace's Secret\", Grace reveals that she was sexually assaulted at age 15 by her father's best friend, Harry.\n\nIn the 11th season, Grace discovers that she is pregnant, the result of a one-night stand while on vacation in Italy. She decides to raise the child with Will, who is also having a child via surrogate. In the series finale, she goes into labor, and Will, Jack, and Karen go with her to the hospital to have the baby and begin a new chapter in her life.\n\nGrace's best friend since college is Will Truman, and their relationship is the focus of the show. They met at a college party at Columbia University. Through the third-season episode \"Lows in the Mid-Eighties,\" we see they began dating and Grace did not realize that Will was gay at the time, and Will had not come out of the closet yet. When Will met Jack McFarland at a party, Jack made him confront his homosexuality. Will \"proposed\" to Grace during Thanksgiving, in an effort to postpone actually having sex with her. When he finally came out to her hours later, Grace was so angry with him that she didn't speak to him for a year. They ran into each other at a grocery store a year later and made up, and became inseparable best friends. Grace moves into Will's apartment in season one when she breaks up with her fiance Danny (Tom Verica). She moves out in season 2 to declare her independence - albeit only to an apartment across the hall. She moves back in the third season. She eventually moves to Brooklyn in season five when she marries Leo but moves back in with Will in season 7 when she gets divorced.\n\nHer closeness to Will is a running joke throughout the series; many other characters refer to them as a married couple. They can finish each other's sentences, which helps them in their fast rounds in trivia and parlor games. They can also be quite dysfunctional and co-dependent, sometimes even requiring the other's approval of clothing and boyfriends. When Will begins dating his future husband Vince D'Angelo (Bobby Cannavale) in season 6, Will is nervous about Grace's opinion of him, noting that he has ended relationships because Grace disliked one detail about them (one example given is that all Grace had to say about one such boyfriend was \"mock turtleneck,\" and the relationship was ruined). Despite this, they are generally caring and supportive of each other.\n\nIn the revived series, which retcons the events of the first series finale, Grace has divorced Leo, and is once again living with Will. They go into business together briefly, before Will gets a job as a law professor. When she gets pregnant in the 11th season, she decides to raise the baby with Will, and they buy a house together in Upstate New York. In the series finale, she goes into labor, and Will assures her that they can do this together as he goes with her to the hospital.\n\nGrace also has a close relationship with her assistant, Karen Walker, a rich, alcoholic socialite who does virtually no work. Karen is nevertheless useful to Grace, as she pays for her employer's health insurance, gives Grace holiday bonuses, and occasionally uses her society connections to help Grace get work. Otherwise, Karen spends her \"work\" hours drinking and belittling Grace. Karen routinely criticizes Grace's choices in fashion (usually by disdainfully asking, \"Honey, what's this all about?\") and men. Karen doesn't exactly withhold her judgments; in one episode, when Will calls Grace at work and Karen answers, she puts him on hold and says \"Grace, the reason you're not in a relationship is on line one.\" Nonetheless, Grace and Karen become close friends over the years. Grace eventually learns to look past Karen's faults, and Karen occasionally does stop ridiculing her to reveal a softer, more caring side. In one episode, Grace stands up to Milo (played by Andy García) who refuses to go on a second date with Karen, who was going through a divorce with her husband Stan and was very vulnerable at the time. In another instance, Karen turns down Grace's proposal for a business loan to protect Grace, who didn't really have a strong business plan.\n\nGrace also has a close bond with Will's other best friend, Jack McFarland. Early in the series, Jack and Grace dislike each other, seeing each other as a rival for Will's affections. However, after they spend time together while Will is in the Cayman Islands between Seasons two and three, they develop a closer friendship. They still antagonize one another, however, often leading to Grace striking Jack in some manner.\n\nGrace has a string of boyfriends throughout the series, many played by guest stars such as Woody Harrelson and Gregory Hines. Grace marries the Jewish doctor Leo Markus (Harry Connick, Jr.) on November 21, 2002, but the marriage ends when he has a one-night stand with a doctor from the Red Cross while working in Cambodia with Doctors Without Borders. In season 8, the two reunite briefly during a flight to London when they coincidentally met on the plane. Their mile high tryst leads to Grace getting pregnant, but she doesn't tell Leo because he is engaged to another woman. However, in the series finale, she and Leo remarry and raise the baby, a girl named Laila, together. Laila is born in Rome, where Leo is working at a hospital as a researcher. After one year in Rome the family moves back to New York, to their apartment in Brooklyn. Laila (Maria Thayer) goes on to attend college and there meets Will and Vince's son, Ben (Ben Newmark). Laila and Ben are living in dorm rooms opposite each other's while at college; the same scenario that Will and Grace found themselves in while they attended college. Ben and Laila marry soon afterward.\n\nWhen the series was revived in 2017, the events of the season finale - in which Grace gives birth to Leo's child and drifts apart from Will - are effectively retconned as one of Karen's alcohol-induced hallucinations. In this continuity, Grace has recently divorced Leo, has never had children, and has moved back in with Will while she recovers from the divorce. When Leo reappears sometime later, it is revealed that the marriage ended because Grace did not trust Leo not to cheat on her again, and because they were never as close as Will and Grace. Despite the couple trying months of therapy and taking up golf together, they could not make it work and Grace, unable to forgive Leo, turned to Will for comfort.\n\nIn season 10, Grace enters a serious relationship with Noah Boarder (David Schwimmer), after several tense meetings where he tries to sabotage her campaign for interior design president. Their romance slowly blossoms, Grace gets to know Noah's daughter, and he eventually asks her to move in with him. In the season finale, when Noah is unable to come to Jack's wedding, Grace is not happy after overhearing Will say she can do much better than him, and begins to wonder where their relationship is going. After meeting Marcus (Reid Scott), a fellow traveler who plans on travelling the world indefinitely in an effort to find himself, Grace decides to leave the country with him to find true happiness.\n\nIn the season 11 premiere, Grace returns to New York from her whirlwind European adventure, during which she had a one-night stand with Marcus. During a doctor's appointment, Grace is startled to find that she is pregnant. When Marcus reappears in the next episode, Grace tells him that she is pregnant with his child, only for Marcus to tell her that he had a vasectomy. Karen then gathers three other men that Grace had sex with during her European adventure in an effort to find out who her baby's father is via a DNA test. Marcus shows up and admits to Grace that he lied about getting a vasectomy, and promises that he will sacrifice his dreams and do everything he can to raise her baby with her. Grace then decides she does not want to know the identity of the father for the time being - all she wants to do is raise the baby, either alone or with someone who loves her.\n\nGrace has a reputation for \"turning\" men gay. Several of her boyfriends – such as Will himself, and her second-season boyfriend Josh – ended up gay or bisexual, and she has a recurring fear that this will happen again. (At one point she entered a room to find her boyfriend Nathan (Woody Harrelson) passed out on a bed with Jack and Will, and moans, \"Oh, no, I turned another one.\") In season 8, she takes this to a new level when she briefly marries James Hanson (Taye Diggs), Will's Canadian boyfriend in search of a green card. They annul the marriage a few days later because of James' callousness and manipulative behavior.\n\n"}
{"id": "1949032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949032", "title": "Slouching Towards Bethlehem", "text": "Slouching Towards Bethlehem\n\nSlouching Towards Bethlehem is a 1968 collection of essays by Joan Didion that mainly describes her experiences in California during the 1960s. It takes its title from the poem \"The Second Coming\" by W. B. Yeats. The contents of this book are reprinted in Didion's \"We Tell Ourselves Stories in Order to Live: Collected Nonfiction\" (2006).\n\nThe title essay describes Didion's impressions of the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco during the neighborhood's heyday as a countercultural center. In contrast to the more utopian image of the milieu promoted by counterculture sympathizers then and now, Didion offers a rather grim portrayal of the goings-on, including an encounter with a pre-school-age child who was given LSD by her parents. \n\nOne critic describes the essay as \"a devastating depiction of the aimless lives of the disaffected and incoherent young,\" with Didion positioned as \"a cool observer but not a hardhearted one.\" Another scholar writes that the essay’s form mirrors its content; the fragmented structure resonates with the essay's theme of societal fragmentation. In a 2011 interview, Didion discussed her technique of centering herself and her perspective in her non-fiction works like \"Slouching Towards Bethlehem\": “I thought it was important always for the reader for me to place myself in the piece so that the reader knew where I was, the reader knew who was talking...At the time I started doing these pieces it was not considered a good thing for writers to put themselves front and center, but I had this strong feeling you had to place yourself there and tell the reader who that was at the other end of the voice.”\n\nDidion originally wrote the piece as an assignment for \"The Saturday Evening Post\" in 1967.\n\nIn her preface to the book, Didion writes, \"I went to San Francisco because I had not been able to work in some months, had been paralyzed by the conviction that writing was an irrelevant act, that the world as I had understood it no longer existed. If I was to work again at all, it would be necessary for me to come to terms with disorder.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe book was immediately favorably received; its popularity continued to grow and become a \"phenomenon\" with a devoted readership in subsequent years.\n\nIn \"The New York Times Book Review\", novelist and screenwriter Dan Wakefield wrote, \"Didion's first collection of nonfiction writing, \"Slouching Towards Bethlehem\", brings together some of the finest magazine pieces published by anyone in this country in recent years. Now that Truman Capote has pronounced that such work may achieve the stature of 'art,' perhaps it is possible for this collection to be recognized as it should be: not as a better or worse example of what some people call 'mere journalism,' but as a rich display of some of the best prose written today in this country.\"\n\n"}

It breaks down changes in the owners' interest in the organization, and in the application of retained profit or surplus from one accounting period to the next. Line items typically include profits or losses from operations, dividends paid, issue or redemption of shares, revaluation reserve and any other items charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income. It also includes the Non-Controlling Interest attributable to other individuals and organisations.\n\nThe statement is expected under the generally accepted accounting principles and explains the owners' equity shown on the balance sheet, where:\nowners' equity = assets − liabilities\n\nIn the United States this is called a \"statement of retained earnings\" and it is required under the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP) whenever comparative balance sheets and income statements are presented. It may appear in the balance sheet, in a combined income statement and changes in retained earnings statement, or as a separate schedule.\n\nTherefore, the statement of retained earnings uses information from the income statement and provides information to the balance sheet.\n\nRetained earnings are part of the balance sheet (another basic financial statement) under \"stockholders equity (shareholders' equity)\" and is mostly affected by net income earned during a period of time by the company less any dividends paid to the company's owners / stockholders. The retained earnings account on the balance sheet is said to represent an \"accumulation of earnings\" since net profits and losses are added/subtracted from the account from period to period.\n\nRetained Earnings are part of the \"Statement of Changes in Equity\".\nThe general equation can be expressed as following:\n\nThis equation is necessary to use to find the Profit Before Tax to use in the Cash Flow Statement under Operating Activities when using the indirect method. This is used whenever a comprehensive income statement is not given but only the balance sheet is given.\n\nIAS 1 requires a business entity to present a \"separate statement of changes in equity\" (SOCE) as one of the components of financial statements.\n\nThe statement shall show: (IAS1.106)\n\nHowever, the amount of dividends recognised as distributions, and the related amount per share, \"may\" be presented in the notes instead of presenting in the statement of changes in equity. (IAS1.107)\n\nFor small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the statement of changes in equity should show all changes in equity including:\n\nThey can omit the statement of changes in equity if the entity has no owner investments or withdrawals other than dividends, and elects to present a combined statement of comprehensive income and retained earnings.\n\nThe following statement of changes in equity is a very brief example prepared in accordance with IFRS. It does not show all possible kinds of items, but it shows the most usual ones for a company. Because it shows Non-Controlling Interest, it's a consolidated statement.\n\n"}

He taught at Harvard Kennedy School of Government and Harvard Law School and was a regular commentator for NPR's \"All Things Considered\".\n\nEdwards was born July 12, 1937, in Cleveland, Ohio. He earned a B.A. in Journalism from the University of Oklahoma in 1958 and a J.D. from Oklahoma City University School of Law in 1969, and was admitted to the Oklahoma bar in 1970. Edwards served as a newspaper reporter and editor from 1958 to 1963, engaged in advertising and public relations from 1963 to 1968 and was a magazine editor from 1968 to 1973. From 1973 to 1974 he served as a legislative assistant for the Republican Steering Committee in Washington, D.C., and he was an instructor in law and journalism at Oklahoma City University in 1976.\n\nIn 1974, Edwards challenged 24-year Democratic incumbent John Jarman and nearly won, holding Jarman to 51 percent of the vote in what was mostly a bad year for Republicans. However, Oklahoma City had been trending Republican for some time. Edwards campaign slogan was \"Take a bite out of Big Government,\" and featured Edwards biting an apple on camera.\n\nJarman switched parties and became a Republican in January 1975 in protest of several older, more conservative Democrats being stripped of their committee chairmanships. He did not run for reelection in 1976. Edwards defeated former state attorney general G. T. Blankenship for the Republican nomination, and narrowly defeated Democratic businessman Tom Dunlap, son of academic E. T. Dunlap, by 3,900 votes. However, he would never face another general election contest anywhere near that close, and was reelected seven times before being ousted in 1992 by Ernest Istook following Edwards' third place showing trailing former Federal Prosecutor Bill Price in the 1992 Republican Primary.\n\nDuring Edwards’s 16 years in Congress, he served variously on the House Budget and Appropriations committees and was the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations. He was also a member of the House Republican leadership, serving as the chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee, the party's fourth-ranking leadership position. However, in 1992, he was defeated in the Republican primary—the real contest in this now-heavily Republican district. He didn't even make the runoff, finishing third behind State Representative Ernest Istook (who went on to win in November) and former federal prosecutor Bill Price. Edwards' loss was due mostly to his involvement in the House banking scandal; he wrote some 386 overdrafts totaling $54,000.\n\nEdwards was one of three founding trustees of the Heritage Foundation and national chairman of the American Conservative Union. Along with former White House Counsel Lloyd Cutler, he has served as co-chairman of Citizens for Independent Courts, a national organization devoted to preserving judicial independence, and co-chairman with another former White House Counsel, Abner Mikva, of Citizens for the Constitution, a national organization concerned with limiting the use of constitutional amendments as a substitute for the normal legislative process. Edwards has also served as co-chairman of a Brookings Institution/Council on Foreign Relations Task Force on Resources for International Affairs as well as the Brookings Working Group on Campaign Finance Reform and for five years as chairman of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. He has served on the board of directors of the Constitution Project and was the director of the congressional policy task forces advising Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign.\n\nIn a radio interview on Fresh Air with Terry Gross on November 5, 2008, Edwards said that he had voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 general election.\n\nAfter leaving Congress, Edwards taught at Harvard Kennedy School of Government and Harvard Law School for 11 years, where he was the first John Quincy Adams Lecturer in Legislative Politics. He taught courses on Congress, political leadership, issue advocacy, election strategies, conservative political theory, and the constitutional separation of powers. In 1997, he was selected by students as the outstanding teacher in the Kennedy School. He has also served as a visiting professor at Georgetown University.\n\nEdwards was a Lecturer of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and a member of the Princeton Project on National Security. He taught courses on \"How to Win Elections\" and \"Congress and the Constitution.\" He is also a Vice President of the Aspen Institute and Director of the Aspen Institute-Rodel Fellowships in Public Leadership.\n\nAs of 2009, Edwards teaches courses on National Security Policy and the Politics of U.S. Foreign Policy at the Elliott School of International Affairs at The George Washington University. In 2013 Edwards was appointed a National Constitution Center – Penn Law Visiting Fellow.\n\nAs a notable dissident Republican leader often critical of Republican officeholders, Edwards has been a regular political commentator on NPR's \"All Things Considered\". His newspaper columns have appeared in the \"Chicago Tribune\" and \"Los Angeles Times\", for which he has been a regular weekly columnist, and frequently in such other publications as the \"New York Times\", \"Washington Post\", \"Boston Globe\", \"San Francisco Examiner\", \"Miami Herald\" and \"Wall Street Journal\". A well-known public speaker, he has spoken on many college campuses, including Boston College, Tulane University, West Point, University of Notre Dame, Duke University, Grinnell College, New York University, MIT, Georgetown University, American University, University of Southern California, the University of Iowa, the University of Texas, and many others.\n\nEdwards has also authored numerous books and articles: \"The Modern Conservative Movement\" (2006), \"Is Congress Gaining the Upper Hand? – Or is the Power of the President Dominant – A Century Foundation Essay,\" (2003), \"Foreign Assistance and Foreign Policy (The Heritage Lectures)\" (1987), \"Behind Enemy Lines: A Rebel in Congress Proposes a Bold New Politics for the 1980s\" (1983), \"Hazardous to Your Health: A New Look at the Health Care Crisis in America\" (1972). He co-authored \"Winning the Influence Game: What Every Business Leader Should Know About Government\" (2001) and \"Financing America’s Leadership: Protecting American Interests and Promoting American Values\" (1997). \"Reclaiming Conservatism\" was issued in February, 2008, by Oxford University Press. His latest book, \"The Parties Vs. the People: How to Turn Republicans and Democrats into Americans\" (2012), is published by Yale University Press.\n\nIn 2009, along with former Congressman Chris Shays from Connecticut, Edwards criticized the Republican Party for neglecting what they characterized as the constitutional abuses perpetrated by the George W. Bush administration.\n\nEdwards was born in Cleveland, Cuyahoga County, Ohio, on July 12, 1937, and spent most of his early years in the southside Capitol Hill section of Oklahoma City, where his father, Eddie Edwards, managed a shoe store. Mickey Edwards was shot three times while working at the family shoe store, according to the \"Daily Oklahoman\". He has one sister, Sheila Braithwaite, who lives in Sacramento, California.\n\nEdwards has been married and divorced 5 times. He was previously married to Miss Oklahoma Lisa Reagan, a singer and composer from Oklahoma City. Edwards is presently married to Elizabeth A. Sherman, a professor of politics at American University. Edwards is Jewish.\n\nEdwards has three children and four grandchildren.\n\n\n"}

It broadcasts Italian political party conventions of all political spectrums, from far right to far left. The remaining airtime is used for programmes about actuality themes relevant for the political beliefs of the Radical Party.\n\nIn December 2008, Radio Radicale was awarded by \"Italia Oggi\" as \"best specialized radio broadcaster\".\n\nRadio Radicale was founded between 1975 and 1976 by a group belonging to the Radical Party in a small apartment near Villa Pamphili, in the Gianicolense district of Rome.\n\nFollowing the liberalization of radio broadcasting by the Constitutional Court between 1974 and 1976, during the spreading of private radio stations, Radio Radicale was characterized by low-budget instruments but it stood out for its particular philosophy. Radio Radicale decided to realize a valid public service alternative to the state broadcaster RAI. The broadcaster decided to use the name “Radicale” (Radical) not only in reference to its role of party branch but also for its editorial policy characterized by impartiality, professionalism and innovation.\n\nAlong with the news about the party, Radio Radicale began a schedule dedicated to the main events of the Italian institutional and political life: since the beginning, its main distinctive traits had been the live broadcasts of parliamentary sessions, congresses of the main parties and important trials, making them accessible to the wide population without cuts and journalistic mediations.\n\nThe radio station introduced press reviews, direct talks with politicians, interviews through the streets and broadcasts for immigrate communities in Italy.\n\nIn summer 1986, the broadcaster risked closure for lacking funds and in this period received thousands of calls which were aired without filters. This new kind of broadcast originated \"Radio Parolaccia\" (Radio Swear Word), an original programme where listeners could express their opinions about various themes. The programme was interrupted by the court after one month and the deputy prosecutor Pietro Saviotti signed a seizure decree of the answering machines on 14 August, because listeners had committed crimes like contempt of the institutions and apology of fascism. After two months, the Parliament intervened and extended the public funding for Party publishing to the radio stations, forcing Radio Radicale to become officially a Party branch. The initiative of free phone calls was replicated in 1991 and 1993.\n\nThe official website was created in 1998 and expanded the radiophonic broadcasting with multimedial contents. The whole wide library had been loaded online and it can be consulted freely.\n\nIn 1997, the Prodi I Cabinet refused to renew the agreement with Radio Radicale for the broadcast of parliamentary sessions and Rai began to develop its own dedicated radio station after 7 years since the law which instituted it. Important cultural and political personalities asked the government to consider decayed the disposition of the \"Mammì bill\" which obliged Rai to create a parliamentary radiophonic channel, to extend the agreement with Radio Radicale for another 3 years and to assign the convention with a call for tender in case of renew.\n\nFollowing a political debate with demonstrations and nonviolent initiatives by the Radicals, the Parliament approved the law Nº 224 of 11 July 1998 on \"Radio broadcasting of Parliament's work and benefits for publishing\". The law confirmed the call for tender with which stipulate the agreement and renewed the contract with Radio Radicale for another three years, Rai's obligation to broadcast parliamentary sessions was kept but the public company was prevented to extend its radiophonic network until the entry into force of the telecommunication general reform.\n\nIn 2001, 2004 and 2006, the agreement with Radio Radicale had been renewed according to the dispositions inside the financial law. The contract excepts that RR has to broadcast, between 8 am and 9 pm, at least 60% of the annual total number of hours dedicated by the Parliament to the sessions in the chambers. Those broadcasts cannot be interrupted, preceded or followed, for a period of thirty minutes from their beginning and their end, by commercial or political adverts.\n\nFor 2010 and 2011, the agreement prolongation with the Ministry of Economic Development excepted a €9.9 million funding for Centro di produzione S.p.a. For 2012, two laws of 2011 allowed a total expenditure of €10 million and for 2013 the same amount was confirmed in 2012.\n\nUntil 2018, Radio Radicale received €8.2 million, according to the agreement with the Ministry of Economic Development for the broadcast of parliamentary sessions, and another €4 million as contribution to the publishing activity.\n\nThe 2019 budget law has prolonged the agreement for the parliamentary session broadcasting by Radio Radicale for only one semester, allocating €5 million gross (€4 million net) for the year 2019. After the deadline on 20 May 2019, Radio Radicale will not have enough resources to go on.\n\nCentro di Produzione SpA is the publisher of Radio Radicale, its archive and of its website. The company, headquartered in Rome, has the following shareholders:\n\n\nOwning 250 plants for terrestrial broadcasting, Radio Radicale covers 75% of the Italian territory and reaches 85% of the population in AM and FM. Furthermore, the broadcast via satellite Eutelsat Hot Bird 13 East has allowed to expand the audience all over Europe and in wide areas of Africa and Asia, including the Middle East, with a potential audience of 98 million households.\n\nRR is available also in streaming through the website and the official app for smartphones, offering also additional multimedia contents.\n\nIt is a member of the consortium DAB Italia for the developing and diffusion of DAB technologies in Italy.\n\nHours of audio and video recordings are made every year through a system of connections with public institutions and events. Signals are received through fixed or temporary lines by wire, radio, satellite or telematic and, when using analogue telephone lines, recordings are immediately digitalised by an encoding system which produces ten channels at the same time around the clock. Once the main headquarter has been reached, different signals are spread for different uses through an active matrix which allows the distribution of 128 signals.\n\nCentro di Produzione S.p.A. is the owner of the seat where Radio Radicale operates, and includes three studies. Two of them have an independent Radio direction, while the third is connected with two directions and it is mainly dedicated to the post-production. All four directions can broadcast.\n\nIn addition to the main studios, the broadcaster has four production centres where transfers, little editing and telephonic interviews recordings are made. Telephonic lines used for conversations to be aired are digitalised and all productions have been made in mp3 since July 2006.\n\nRadio Radicale is organized through the following division in sectors:\n\n\nIn addiction to employees, these sectors make use of cooperation of collaborators and consultants.\n\nThe constant work of document collection and preservation done by Radio Radicale during its activity has allowed the creation of an important and wide archive, defined in 1993 by the Archival Superintendency as \"of a remarkable historical interest\". In the same year, the archive was quoted in the volume \"Fonti orali: censimento degli istituti di conservazione\" published by the Italian Ministry of Cultural and Environmental Heritage, while in the following year it was a subject of the \"Congresso sugli archivi dei partiti politici\" (Congress About Political Parties' Archives) organized by the Central Archives of the State.\n\nThe archive can be consulted freely and by everyone.\n\nIn May 2007, during the congress \"L'archivio multimediale di Radio Radicale: un patrimonio per la storia, l'informazione, la democrazia\" (The Multimedial Archive of Radio Radicale: an Heritage for History, Information, Democracy), organized by the RR along with the Doctorate of Research on European History and the Archivists and Librarists Special School of the Sapienza University of Rome, various critics and archivist agreed in recognizing not only the historical and social value of the archival production of Radio Radicale, but also its complementarity with the main collections of Italian documents, first of all those belonging to RAI. The former manager of Rai Teche, Barbara Scaramucci, stated that:\n\nOther evidenced the particularity of the public service done by a private radio station like Radio Radicale. Paola Carucci, councillor of the President of Italian Republic for the Historical Archive, claims:\n\nThe choice of Marco Pannella to preserve, catalogue and archive all the recordings without any manipulations on tapes allows the citizens to consult 430 000 documents (cassettes, tapes, mp3, mp4, RealAudio and RealVideo), which contains the most important events of the institutional, political, social and cultural history of Italy: there are full recordings which allow to everyone to know and relive an event in its entirety. The archive of the radio is in continuous expansion and receives every day tens of new documents which are added to those already existing.\n\nThe history of the archive is closely linked with Radio Radicale which preserved every cassette and tape of the aired programmes since its first broadcasting in 1976. However, the archive owns also some records done before 1976 and precisely 52 tapes and 216 cassettes for the period from 1967 - 1975, in addition to some tapes of 1941 (a radiophonic interview in English recovered by Ernesto Rossi where Gaetano Salvemini comments the obtaining of the American citizenship), some of 1960 (the recording of a concerence held by Ernesto Rossi in Florence entitled \"L'antifascismo in carcere e al confino\") and others of 1966 (Ernesto Rossi's \"Salvemini maestro ed amico\").\n\nThe proper archive thought of as a service with its own specialized staff was established three years after the start of Radio activities, so that the sorting of collected recordings has started since 1979. In 1987 the classification and archive changed with the introduction of computer systems and today the analog documentation is at an advanced digitalization. The director of the archive has been Gabriella Fanello Marcucci since 1992.\n\nDocuments preserved in the Sound Archive of Radio Radicale can be classified in: Institutional Archive, Judicial Archive, Political Parties and Movements Archive, Associations, Unions and Movements Archive and Cultural Archive. The archive has a total of 430,718 recordings, 196,101 speakers and 662,404 media, including over 85,000 interviews, 21,000 hearings of the most important trials, 3,000 congresses held by parties, associations or labour unions, more than 26,000 debates and book presentations, over 6,000 political rallies and demonstrations, 19,500 press conferences and more than 13,000 conventions.\n\nOnline since 1998, the website of Radio Radicale has been one of the first in Italy to stream actuality videos on the web and nowadays political, social and institutional events of the past and of recent times are always available for all the citizens.\n\nBetween February and March 1998, Radicals organized a convention entitled \"Quali lotte e leggi subito per la rivoluzione tecnologica, per la rivoluzione liberale\" (Which struggles and laws to be done immediately for technological revolution, for liberal revolution), attended by the major Italian entrepreneurs of ITs and telecommunications, lawyers and other specialists of that field.\n\nDuring the convention, a plan of funding for the construction of a new society of information was proposed to institutions and companies, through the application of new technologies to the democratic activities. In particular, along with the introduction of the electronic vote and of the telematic official notice board, computer literacy in schools, liberalization of telematic publishing and commercial companies, the main proposal was about the online networking of public institutions.\n\nContents and goals of the congress formed later the foundations of RR website with the guide of Rino Spampanato; the broadcaster realized the first Italian webcast system making freely available the sessions of all the Italian Parliament's broadcast and archived sessions.\n\nThe website of Radio Radicale made possible the streaming of the sessions held by the European Parliament, Court of Audit, High Council of the Judiciary and other institutions.\n\nThe website is made using mainly free software like Linux, PHP, Apache HTTP Server, Apache Solr, MariaDB, Varnish, Nginx and Icecast.

The start of the experimentations of these multimedial service was required by law n. 350 of 2003.\n\nIn 2006 the editorial board of \"RadioRadicale.it\" created \"FaiNotizia.it\", the first Italian website of citizen journalism: based on Newsvine, it was intended as a social and journalistic experiment and an attempt to use the new free and collaborative attitude of the new media at the time, creating a new model of information.\n\nOn \"Fai notizia\", registered users could collaborate in searching and writing the news, loading texts, videos, photos, evidencing interesting news found on other websites or blogs. Users commented and voted the reports made by other members and could start collaborative investigations. All the content had been published under Creative Commons licences.\n\nIn 2012 \"Fai notizia\" was completely renewed and transformed into a format of investigations distributed by Radio Radicale, which offers now little payments for who collaborates in creating reports about great issues of public interest.\n\nRadio Radicale receives every year a public funding of €8.33 million according to the agreement with the State for the broadcast of parliamentary sessions, and €4.431 million from the publishing funding due to its nature of branch of the Pannella List. In August 2008 Radio Radicale was the only broadcaster to be excluded from the public funds resizing for the publishing due to its nature of private radio broadcaster active according to law no. 230 of 7 August 1990.\n\nThe law recognizing \"private radio broadcasters which do activities of general interest information\" was approved in 1990 to recognize the radio broadcasters which had broadcast \"own information programmes about political, religious, economical, social, unions related or literary events for not less than nine hours between 7 am and 20 pm\" and \"extended the number of plants to the 50 per cent of the provinces and the 85 per cent of the Regions\".\n\nAmong with the other entities receiving public funds, Radio Radicale is the only one having a national network and spends over €3.7 million every year just for the technical management, and it is also the only one which dedicates almost all the schedule to broadcast service public programmes.\n\nThe schedule revolves around parliamentary sessions accordingly to an agreement with former Ministry of Communications (now part of Ministry of Economic Development), covering over 60% of sessions of both Houses through the 8-20 time slot. During the residual time, Radio Radicale tries to document also the activities of other institutions (Communal Councils, Court of Audit, High Council of the Judiciary, European Parliament), as well as congress, festivals and major meetings of all political parties, those organized by trade and labour unions, demonstrations, important press conferences, debates and book presentations.\n\nNews bulletins are broadcast every day and they are built around interviews and reading of news provided by press agencies.\n\nSpace dedicated to the politicians and parliamentarians in particular is a typical characteristic of RR, tough it is a party branch and so it can not respect the \"par condicio\", and offers a certain balance across the political groups. Politicians often participate in a programme, called \"Filodiretto\" (Direct line), where they dialogue with listeners without access limitations but with only a bond of 40 seconds for each call. In recent years these programmes are reduced but the Radio invites a politician every week.\n\nAn historical programme of Radio Radicale was \"Conversazione settimanale con Marco Pannella\" (Weekly conversation with Marco Pannella), aired from 2001 to January 2016. Former director of the Radio, Massimo Bordin, (alternating with Valter Vecellio) interviewed Marco Pannella about themes regarding politics and initiatives of radicals.\n\nAt midnight there is the reading of front pages of the newspapers of the following day and this programme starts the night schedule, when events not broadcast in the daytime schedule are aired along with recordings taken and selected from the archive.\n\n\n\nSince 1980, Radio Radicale has broadcast pieces of requiems during the breaks between programmes as a symbol of mourning, and protest, in front of deaths for hunger which occurs every day. The most used are those from the Requiem in D minor, composed by W. A. Mozart, but other classical music pieces are broadcast, like the \"Dies Irae\" from \"Messa da Requiem\" by Giuseppe Verdi and rarely the \"Sanctus\" from the Requiem by Gabriel Fauré.\n\n\n"}

Instead, Local Futures believes that the focus must be on changing the fundamental forces that create or exacerbate all of these problems. Among those forces are economic globalization, corporate power, and conventional notions of technological and economic \"progress\". As a solution, Local Futures promotes economic localization and other locally based alternatives to the global consumer culture, as a means to protect both biological and cultural diversity. The group is also associated with the concept of Counter-development.\n\nLocal Futures is the parent organization of a program in Ladakh, or \"Little Tibet\", begun in 1975. The Ladakh Project includes a wide range of hands-on activities, including a renewable-energy program, and has won international recognition for countering the negative effects of conventional development in that region. Local Futures' founder and Director, Helena Norberg-Hodge, shared the 1986 Right Livelihood Award.\n\nLocal Futures has produced two award-winning documentary films: \"Ancient Futures: Learning from Ladakh\" (1993) and \"The Economics of Happiness\" (2011).

{"id": "1949071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949071", "title": "Settlement movement", "text": "Settlement movement\n\nThe settlement movement was a reformist social movement that began in the 1880s and peaked around the 1920s in England and the United States. Its goal was to bring the rich and the poor of society together in both physical proximity and social interconnectedness. Its main object was the establishment of \"settlement houses\" in poor urban areas, in which volunteer middle-class \"settlement workers\" would live, hoping to share knowledge and culture with, and alleviate the poverty of, their low-income neighbors. The settlement houses provided services such as daycare, education, and healthcare to improve the lives of the poor in these areas.\n\nThe movement started in 1884 with the founding of Toynbee Hall in Whitechapel, in the East End of London. These houses, radically different from those later examples in America, often offered food, shelter, and basic and higher education, provided by virtue of charity on part of wealthy donors, the residents of the city, and (for education) scholars who volunteered their time.\n\nVictorian England, increasingly concerned with poverty, gave rise to the movement whereby those connected to universities settled students in slum areas to live and work alongside local people. Through their efforts settlement houses were established for education, savings, sports, and arts. Such institutions were often praised by religious representatives concerned with the lives of the poor, and criticised as normative or moralistic by radical social movements.\n\nThere were basic commonalities in the movement. These institutions were more concerned with societal causes for poverty, especially the changes that came with industrialisation, rather than personal causes which their predecessors believed were the main reason for poverty. The settlement movement believed that social reform was best pursued and pushed for by private charities. The movement was oriented toward a more collectivist approach and was a seen as a response to socialist challenges that confronted the British political economy and philanthropy.\n\nThe British Association of Settlements and Social Action Centres is a network of such organisations.\nOther early examples include Browning Hall, formed in Walworth in 1895 by Francis Herbert Stead, and Mansfield House Settlement, also in east London (see Percy Alden). Oxford House in Bethnal Green was sponsored by High Church Anglicans associated with Oxford University.\n\nThere is also a global network, The International Federation of Settlements and Neighborhood Centers (IFS).\n\nThe movement gave rise to many social policy initiatives and innovative ways of working to improve the conditions of the most excluded members of society. The Poor Man's Lawyer service came about because a barrister volunteered his time and encouraged his friends to do the same. In general, the settlement movement, and settlement houses in particular, \"have been a foundation for social work practice in this country\".\n\nAs higher education opened up to women, young female graduates came into the settlement movement. The Women's University Settlement (now Blackfriars Settlement) was founded in 1887 \"by women from Girton and Newnham Colleges at Cambridge University, Lady Margaret and Somerville Colleges at Oxford University and Bedford and Royal Holloway Universities\".\n\nThe settlement movement model was introduced in the United States by Jane Addams after travelling to Europe and learning about the system in England. It was Addams who became the leading figure of the settlement movement in the United States with the help of like-minded personalities such as Mary Rozer Smith, Mary Keyser, Alice Hamilton, Julia Lathrop, and Florence Kelley, among others.\n\nThe settlement movement became popular due to the socio-economic situation in the United States between 1890 and 1910, when more than 12 million European people immigrated to the country. They came from Ireland, Russia, Italy and other European countries and provided cheap factory labor, a demand that was created with the country's expansion into the west following the Civil War. Many immigrants lived in crowded and disease-ridden tenements, worked long hours, and lived in poverty. Children often worked to help support the family. Jacob Riis wrote \"How the Other Half Lives\" about the lives of immigrants on New York City's Lower East Side to bring greater awareness of the immigrant's living conditions.\n\nThe most famous settlement house in the United States is Chicago's Hull House, founded by Addams and Ellen Gates Starr in 1889 after Addams visited Toynbee Hall within the previous two years. Hull House, though, was not a religious-based organization. Instead of Christian ethic, Addams opted to ground her settlement on democratic ideals. It focused on providing education and recreational facilities for European immigrant women and children.\n\nKatharine Coman, Vida Scudder, and Katharine Lee Bates were among a group of women who founded Denison House in Boston in 1892. Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, founded in 1894, Friendly Inn Settlement House, founded in 1894, Henry Street Settlement, founded in 1893, Hiram House, founded in 1896, Houchen House in El Paso Texas, founded in 1912 and University Settlement House, founded in 1886 and the oldest in the United States, were, like Hull House, important sites for social reform. United Neighborhood Houses of New York is the federation of 38 settlement houses in New York City. These and other settlement houses inspired the establishment of settlement schools to serve isolated rural communities in Appalachia, such as the Hindman Settlement School in 1902 and the Pine Mountain Settlement School in 1913.\n\nBy 1913, there were 413 settlements in 32 states. By the 1920s, there were almost 500 settlement houses in the country. The settlement house concept was continued by Dorothy Day's Catholic Worker \"hospitality houses\" in the 1930s.\n\nAmerican settlement houses functioned on a philosophy of \"scientific philanthropy\", a belief that instead of giving direct relief, charities should give resources to the poor so they could break out of the circle of poverty. American charity workers feared that the deeply entrenched social class system in Europe would develop in the United States.\n\nThe movement also spread to late imperial Russia, as Stanislav Shatsky and Alexander Zelenko set up a network of educational and social institutions in northern Moscow in 1905, naming it \"Setlement\" (\"\", the English word transliterated to Russian). This network of institutions was closed down by the government in 1908, due to alleged socialist activities.\n\nToday, settlements are still community-focused organizations, providing a range of services including early education, youth guidance and crime intervention, senior programs, and specialized programs for young people who have \"aged out\" of the foster care system. Since they are staffed by professional employees and students, they no longer require that employees live alongside those they serve.\n\nSettlement houses influenced urban design and architecture in the 20th century.\nFor example, James Rossant of Conklin + Rossant agreed with Robert E. Simon's social vision and consciously sought to mix economic backgrounds when drawing up the master plan for Reston, Virginia. The New Monastic movement has a similar goal and model.\n\n\n\n"}

He currently serves as the Brewers‘ special instructor of player development.\n\nMoney spent most of his big league career as a third baseman and was a four-time All-Star. Known as one of the best defensive third basemen of the era, he batted and threw right-handed. He played for the MLB Phillies from (–) and Brewers –). Money played for the NPB Buffaloes (in Japan) for one month, at the end of his career.\n\nMoney was originally signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates as an amateur free agent in 1965 out of La Plata High School in southern While still in the minors, the Pirates traded him in 1967 to the Philadelphia Phillies (with Harold Clem, Woodie Fryman and Bill Laxton) for Jim Bunning. Called up by the Phillies in 1968, he began his major league career as a shortstop, but was moved to third base when Larry Bowa was called up by the Phillies. With the Phillies looking to make room for Mike Schmidt, Money was part of a seven-player deal that sent him, John Vukovich and Bill Champion to the Brewers for Jim Lonborg, Ken Brett, Ken Sanders and Earl Stephenson on October 31, 1972.\n\nMoney's most productive seasons were those in 1974, 1977, and 1978 while playing for the Milwaukee Brewers. In 1974, he set career-highs in hits (178), doubles (32), and at bats (629). He also had 19 stolen bases and made his first All-Star team. In 1977, he had career-highs in home runs (25), Runs batted in (83), slugging percentage (.470), and total bases (268). He also had 86 runs scored and made his third All-Star Game. In 1978, he had career-highs in batting average (.293), on-base percentage (.361), and sacrifice hits (14). He also had 7 hit by pitches, and made his fourth and final All-Star team.\n\nLate in his career, Money finally made the post-season with the Milwaukee Brewers in 1981. Because of a prolonged strike, Major League Baseball chose to have a split-season format. In the American League Eastern Division, the first-half champion New York Yankees played Milwaukee, the second half champion. Money, having his worst major league season to date, only had three plate appearances as the Brewers lost the series to New York, 3 games to 2. He saw more action the following postseason as the Brewers defeated the California Angels in the American League Championship Series. In his only World Series of his career, Money and the Brewers lost in seven games to the St. Louis Cardinals in 1982. He had a .185 batting average in the 1982 post-season, and a .231 average in the World Series, picking up 2 playoff RBI all-time.\nIn a 16-season career, Money hit .261 with 176 home runs and 729 RBIs in 1,720 games. He had a lifetime on-base percentage of .328 and a .406 slugging percentage. He also had 80 career stolen bases with 798 runs. He had 1,623 hits in 6,215 at bats.\n\nIn 1971, he hit the first ever home run at Veterans Stadium on April 10.\n\nOn July 7, 1974, he set the major league record for errorless games at third base, with 78. He would go on to complete an 86-game streak with no errors in 257 chances.\n\nOn April 10, 1976, Money hit a grand slam off Dave Pagan of the New York Yankees, only to see it taken back because the first base umpire had called time before the pitch was delivered. According to most accounts, the time out was only granted after the home run, when Yankees manager Billy Martin appealed to the umpire that he had discreetly asked for time out.\n\nAfter retiring from MLB, he contracted with the Kintetsu Buffaloes in the Japanese Professional League. Money had watched many games of the Yomiuri Giants and noted the large crowds and their beautiful stadium. Kintetsu had a dilapidated stadium, however, and rarely drew much of a crowd. The team put Money up in a cockroach-ridden apartment rather than a house in a tree-lined setting as he felt he had been promised. After one month Money packed up his family and moved back to his farm in Vineland, New Jersey.\n\nMoney began his minor league coaching career as manager of the Class A Oneonta Tigers from 1987 to 1988. He became manager of the Class A Beloit Snappers in 1998. After seven years at Beloit, he moved up to the Brewers' Double-A affiliate, the Huntsville Stars in 2005. In 2007, Money was named the Southern League's Manager of the Year as voted upon by the league's field managers, radio broadcasters, and print media. On May 14, 2008, he became the winningest manager in Stars' history; he finished the season with 275 victories. Money managed the Nashville Sounds, Milwaukee's Triple-A club, from 2009 to 2011. Following the 2011 season, he became Milwaukee's special instructor of player development.\n\nIn 2005, Money was inducted into the Milwaukee Brewers Walk of Fame at Miller Park. He was inducted along with one of his former Brewers managers, Harvey Kuenn. Money said that his induction was \"the greatest honor of all\" of his baseball career.\n\n"}
{"id": "1949083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949083", "title": "The Cincinnati Kid", "text": "The Cincinnati Kid\n\nThe Cincinnati Kid is a 1965 American drama film. It tells the story of Eric \"The Kid\" Stoner, a young Depression-era poker player, as he seeks to establish his reputation as the best. This quest leads him to challenge Lancey \"The Man\" Howard, an older player widely considered to be the best, culminating in a climactic final poker hand between the two.\n\nThe script, adapted from Richard Jessup's novel, was written by Ring Lardner Jr. and Terry Southern; it was Lardner's first major studio work since his 1947 blacklisting as one of The Hollywood Ten. The film was directed by Norman Jewison and stars Steve McQueen in the title role and Edward G. Robinson as Howard. Jewison, who replaced original director Sam Peckinpah shortly after filming began, describes \"The Cincinnati Kid\" as his \"ugly duckling\" film. He considers it the film that allowed him to transition from the lighter comedic films he had previously been making and take on more serious films and subjects.\n\nThe film garnered mixed reviews from critics on its initial release; supporting actors Robinson and Joan Blondell earned award nominations for their performances.\n\nIn the 1930s Eric Stoner, nicknamed \"The Kid\", is an up-and-coming poker player in New Orleans. He hears that Lancey Howard, a longtime master of the game nicknamed \"The Man\", is in town, and sees it as his chance to finally become the Man himself. The Kid's friend Shooter cautions him, reminding the Kid how Shooter thought he was the best five-card stud player in the world, until Howard \"gutted\" him when they played.\n\nHoward arranges a game with wealthy William Jefferson Slade, who secures Shooter's services as dealer. Howard wins $6,000 from Slade over a 30-hour game, angering Slade and wounding his pride. That night at Slade's home, he tries to bribe Shooter into cheating in the Kid's favor when the two players meet. Shooter declines, but Slade calls in Shooter's markers worth $12,000, and blackmails him by threatening to reveal damaging information about Shooter's wild wife, Melba. Shooter agonizes over his decision, having spent the last 25 years building a reputation for integrity.\n\nWith the Kid's girl Christian visiting her parents, Melba tries to seduce him, even though she and Christian are close friends. Out of respect for Shooter, he rebuffs her, and spends the day before the game with Christian at her family's farm.\n\nThe Kid intentionally arrives late to the game. The big game starts with six players, including Howard and the Kid, with Shooter playing as he deals and Lady Fingers relieving him whenever Shooter needs a break. In the first big confrontation between the Kid and Howard, the Kid is short $2,000 and Slade steps in to stake him. Several hours later, Howard busts a player called Pig, perhaps with a bluff, and the remaining players take a break. Following the break, Lady Fingers, who has been delighting in needling Howard all evening, takes over as dealer and continues to needle him.\n\nAs the game wears on, Shooter only deals, and then after another hand when Howard outplays them, two more players, Yeller and Sokal, drop out. That leaves just Howard and the Kid. After a few unlikely wins, the Kid calls for a break and confronts Shooter, who admits to being forced into cheating by Slade. The Kid insists he can win on his own and tells Shooter to deal straight or he will blow the whistle, destroying Shooter's reputation. Before the game resumes, Melba succeeds in seducing the Kid. Christian makes a surprise visit to the room, catches them after the fact and walks out on the Kid.\n\nSlade tells the Kid that Shooter will continue to cheat for him and confronts him with a menacing thug, but the Kid flatly refuses. Back at the game, the Kid maneuvers to have Shooter replaced by Lady Fingers, lying that Shooter is ill. He then wins several major pots from Howard, who is visibly losing confidence.\n\nDuring the final hand Howard beats the Kid with a queen-high straight flush. The Kid turns over his cards to show he has a full house, aces full of tens. This loss devastates the Kid, who not only loses all his money in this final hand, but also an additional $5,000 raise from Howard which the Kid called before Howard showed his hand. Howard then mocks the Kid, telling him that he will always be \"second best\" as long as Howard is around. As the Kid leaves the table, he is ridiculed by both Slade and Melba, and consoled by Shooter.\n\nFollowing the game, the Kid leaves the hotel and loses a penny pitch to the shoe shine boy he had beaten at the same game at the film's opening. Around the corner, he runs into Christian and they embrace.\n\nIn some cuts, the film ends with a freeze-frame on Steve McQueen's face following his penny-pitching loss. Turner Classic Movies and the DVD feature the ending with Christian. Jewison wanted to end the film with the freeze-frame but was overruled by the producer.\n\nThe cockfight scene was cut by British censors.\n\n\n\"The Cincinnati Kid\" was filmed on location in New Orleans, Louisiana, a change from the original St. Louis, Missouri, setting of the novel. Spencer Tracy was originally cast as Lancey Howard, but ill health forced him to withdraw from the film. Sam Peckinpah was originally hired to direct; producer Martin Ransohoff fired him shortly after filming began for \"vulgarizing the picture.\" Peckinpah's version was to be shot in black-and-white to give the film a 1930s period feel. Jewison scrapped the black-and-white footage, feeling it was a mistake to shoot a film with the red and black of playing cards in greyscale. He did mute the colors throughout, both to evoke the period and to help pop the card colors when they appeared. Strother Martin said he was cast in the film but got fired after Jewison replaced Peckinpah.\n\nThe film features a theme song performed by Ray Charles, the Eureka Brass Band performing a second line parade, and a scene in Preservation Hall with Emma Barrett (vocalist and pianist), Punch Miller (trumpet), Paul Crawford (trombone), George Lewis (clarinet), Cie Frazier (drums) and Allan Jaffe (helicon).\n\n\nThe world premiere was held at the Saenger Theatre in New Orleans on October 15, 1965 with a nationwide release on October 27. On November 5 the film opened in Los Angeles.\n\n\"The Cincinnati Kid\" was released on Region 1 DVD on May 31, 2005. The DVD features a commentary track by director Norman Jewison, commentary on selected scenes from \"Celebrity Poker Showdown\" hosts Phil Gordon and Dave Foley and \"The Cincinnati Kid Plays According to Hoyle\", a promotional short featuring magician Jay Ose. A Blu-Ray was released on June 14, 2011.\nWith the release of the film on DVD, one modern reviewer said the film \"is as hip now as when it was released in 1965\" and another cited McQueen as \"effortlessly watchable as the Kid, providing a masterclass in the power of natural screen presence over dialogue\" and Robinson \"simply fantastic.\" Poker author Michael Wiesenberg calls \"The Cincinnati Kid\" \"[o]ne of the greatest poker movies of all time.\"\n\nUpon its 1965 release, \"The Cincinnati Kid\" was favorably reviewed by \"Variety\" which wrote \"Martin Ransohoff has constructed a taut, well-turned-out production. In Steve McQueen he has the near-perfect delineator of the title role. Edward G. Robinson is at his best in some years as the aging, ruthless Lancey Howard...\" Howard Thompson of \"The New York Times\" called the film a \"respectably packaged drama\" that is \"strictly for those who relish—or at least play—stud poker\" and notes that the \"film pales beside \"The Hustler\", to which it bears a striking similarity of theme and characterization.\" \"Time\" magazine also noted the similarities to \"The Hustler\", saying \"nearly everything about \"Cincinnati Kid\" is reminiscent\" of that film, but falls short in the comparison, in part because of the subject matter:\n\nDirector Jewison can put his cards on the table, let his camera cut suspensefully to the players' intent faces, but a pool shark sinking a tricky shot into a side pocket undoubtedly offers more range. \"Kid\" also has a less compelling subplot. Away from the table, McQueen gambles on a blonde (Tuesday Weld) and on the integrity of his dealer pal, Karl Malden. Pressure comes from a conventionally vicious Southern gentleman (Rip Torn), whose pleasures include a Negro mistress, a pistol range adjacent to his parlor, and fixed card games. As Malden's wife, Ann-Margret spells trouble of another kind, though her naive impersonation of a wicked, wicked woman recalls the era when the femme fatale wore breastplates lashed together with spider web. By the time all the bets are in, \"Cincinnati Kid\" appears to hold a losing hand.\n\nA retrospective review published by the New York State Writers Institute of the University at Albany also noted the similarities the film had to \"The Hustler\", but in contrast said \"The Cincinnati Kid\"s \"stylized realism, dreamlike color, and detailed subplots give [the film] a dramatic complexity and self-awareness that \"The Hustler\" lacks.\"\n\nBlondell was singled out for her performance as Lady Fingers with an award from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress. \"Motion Picture Exhibitor\" magazine nominated Robinson for its Best Supporting Actor Laurel Award.\n\n\nNotes\n"}

On 1 April 1517 George and his first wife redeemed by purchase family lands which James IV of Scotland had sold to Andrew Barton.\n\nHe was Sheriff of Fife from 1529 to 1540 and a Lord of Session from 1541 and a Lord of the Articles from 1544.\n\nGeorge accompanied James V of Scotland on his wedding trip to France in 1536. He was tried for the murder of Cardinal Beaton and acquitted in 1546. He was ambassador to Denmark in 1550, and died at Dieppe, France in 1558.\n\nGeorge died while returning from the solemnization of the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, which he witnessed. Several of the other Scottish commissioners died, Lord Fleming at Paris, and the Bishop of Orkney and Earl of Cassillis at Dieppe on the same night as George, 24 November 1558. It was rumoured that they were murdered because of their stance of the issue of giving the Crown-Matrimonial of Scotland to the Dauphin.\n\nHe married firstly, Margaret Crichton, illegitimate daughter of William, 3rd Lord Crichton and Princess Margaret Stewart. Their eldest son was Norman Leslie who was involved in the murder of Cardinal Beaton and the siege of St Andrews Castle. Norman pre-deceased his father, and the next Earl was Andrew Leslie, a son of George's third marriage to Agnes, daughter of John Somerville of Cambusnethan, Lanarkshire.\n\nGeorge divorced Margaret Crichton on 27 November 1520, and married, 5 June 1525, Elizabeth, daughter of Andrew, 3rd Lord Gray. She was the widow of John Lyon, 4th Lord Glamis. They had no children, she dying before 1530. George married thirdly, Agnes, a daughter of John Somerville of Cambusnethan, the widow of John, 2nd Lord Fleming, with issue. After Agnes's death, in 1542, George was re-united with Margaret Crichton and they had further issue. He then married Isobel Lundy widow of the 7th Earl of Crawford, with no issue.\n\nChildren of George and Margaret include;\nChildren of George and Agnes Somerville;\n\n"}

It is traditionally the final event of a track meet. At top class events, the first 500 metres is run in lanes. Start lines are thus staggered over a greater distance than in an individual 400 metres race; the runners then typically move to the inside of the track. The slightly longer 4 × 440 yards relay was a formerly run British and American event, until metrication was completed in the 1970s.\n\nRelay race runners typically carry a relay baton which they must transfer between teammates. Runners have a 20 m box (usually marked with blue lines) in which to transfer the baton. The first transfer is made within the staggered lane lines; for the second and third transfers, runners typically line up across the track despite the fact that runners are usually running in line on the inside of the track. This prevents confusion and collisions during transfer. Unlike the 4 × 100 m relay, runners in the 4 × 400 typically look back and grasp the baton from the incoming runner, due to the fatigue of the incoming runner, and the wider margins allowed by the longer distance of the race. Consequently, disqualification is rare.\n\nAs runners have a running start, split times cannot be compared to individual 400 m performances. Internationally, the U.S. men's team has dominated the event, but have been challenged by Jamaica in the 1950s and Britain in the 1990s. The current men's Olympic champions are from the United States.\n\nAccording to the IAAF rules, world records in relays can only be set if all team members have the same nationality.\n\nMixed-gendered 4 × 400 metres relays were introduced at the 2017 IAAF World Relays, with the IAAF first recognizing a world record in that event at the 2019 World Athletics Championships.\n\n\"Note:\" The IAAF rescinded a time of 2:54.20 set at Uniondale on 22 July 1998 by the United States (Jerome Young, Antonio Pettigrew, Tyree Washington, Michael Johnson) on 12 August 2008 after Pettigrew admitted to using human growth hormone and EPO between 1997 and 2003.\n\n\"Note:\" A time of 3:00.77 by the USC team (Zach Shinnick, Rai Benjamin, Ricky Morgan Jr., Michael Norman) at the 2018 NCAA Division I Championship was rejected as a record as Benjamin was a citizen of Antigua & Barbuda, and the others are US citizens. US runners Ilolo Izu, Robert Grant, Devin Dixon and Mylik Kerley recorded a 3:01.39 in the same race, which has not yet been ratified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1949102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949102", "title": "IBM 1360", "text": "IBM 1360\n\nThe IBM 1360 Photo-Digital Storage System, or PDSS, was an online archival storage system for large data centers. It was the first storage device designed from the start to hold a terabit of data (128 GB). The 1360 stored data on index card sized pieces of stiff photographic film that were individually retrieved and read, and could be updated by copying data, with changes, to a new card. Only six PDSSs were constructed, including the prototype, and IBM abandoned the film-card system and moved on to other storage systems soon after. Only one similar commercial system seems to have been developed, the Foto-Mem FM 390, from the late 1960s.\n\nIn the mid-1950s IBM's San Jose lab was contracted by the CIA to provide a system to retrieve vast numbers of printed documents. The lab was interested in using a new type of photographic film known as Kalvar. Kalvar was developed to make copies of existing microfilm stock, simply by placing the Kalvar and original together, exposing them to ultraviolet light, and then heating the Kalvar to develop it. This could be carried out in a continuous roll-to-roll process. IBM's proposal, code named \"Walnut\", was a mechanical system that would automate the process of copying materials in the store using the Kalvar film.\n\nTo further develop the system, in January 1958 IBM hired Jack Kuehler to head up a team exploring Kalvar-based films. He quickly concluded that Kalvar was not stable enough to store data with the sort of reliability IBM demanded, breaking down over a period of a few years and giving off corrosive gas while it did so. Kalvar is based on a diazo film and Kuehler was able to identify a similar film that would provide the reliability required, although at the price of needing to be developed in a \"wet lab\" process. He proposed a new version of Walnut that replaced the Kalvar developer with an automated diazo film developer system that developed the film in a few minutes. He was able to convince the CIA to accept this change, and the new version was announced in 1961 and delivered the next year.\n\nThe primary element in a Walnut system was a large cylindrical carousel called the \"document store\". Each store contained 200 small boxes IBM referred to as \"cells\", in keeping with earlier magnetic tape-based systems. Each cell contained 50 strips of film, each of these containing 99 photographs arranged in a 3 by 33 grid. In total, each document store contained images of 990,000 documents, and up to 100 document stores could be used in a single Walnut system, for a total storage of 99,000,000 pages.\n\nA separate system was used to access pages from the Walnut system. Users would look up keywords stored on an IBM 1405 hard disk system, identifying individual documents to be retrieved. The machine produced punched cards that were inserted into the Walnut. The Walnut system retrieved the documents, copied them onto a film strip and developed it, and then inserted four such images into an aperture card. The card could be read directly on a microfilm reader, or used as negatives for full-sized printouts.\n\nWhen Walnut was successfully delivered in 1961, the San Jose lab turned its attention to commercializing the system under the project name \"Cypress\". A direct analog of Walnut for document storage became the 1350 Photo Image Retrieval System, while the same basic system adapted to storing computer data became the 1360 Photo-Digital Storage System. Both systems used the same photographic cards and automated film development system originally developed for Walnut, but replaced the diazo film with longer-lasting conventional silver halide films. The system used pneumatics to move the film cards between the more complex developer system, the reader/copier, and a much larger store.\nJack Harker was the Program Manager for the development and delivery of the systems.\n\nAt about the same time, the Atomic Energy Commission started looking for a system able to store 1 terabit for online access by supercomputers running simulations. IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center proposed a new version of the 10 inch optical disk they had developed for the AN/GSQ-16 (Mark II) Russian-to-English machine translation system. San Jose instead proposed a Cypress system for the same role. Cypress won the contest, and a $2.1 million () contract was awarded for two machines, one for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the other for the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The former was delivered in September 1967 and the latter in March 1968. Three more systems were eventually delivered, two for the National Security Agency and another for Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n\nThese would be the only Cypress systems delivered. By the time they were in place, IBM had developed a number of other storage systems of similar size, and started suggesting the IBM 3850 in favor of the 1360. Magnetic tape, such as the tape in the 3850, required stricter attention to humidity and temperature than the optical film of the Photostore. Its few users generally preferred the 1360, and three of the five were still being used in 1977, and the last system shut down only in 1980 when IBM stopped servicing them.\n\nThe IBM 1350 never sold a single unit. In 1966 the company started a \"controlled marketing program\", but after a year they realized that the system would need additional development before it would be commercially acceptable. Instead they decided to cancel its development.\n\nData was stored on small 35 by 70 mm cards of stiff film known as \"chips\", each one holding 32 data \"frames\" in a 4 x 8 array. Each frame contained 492 lines of about 420 bits each, 0s written as a black-clear pattern, and 1s as a clear-black (using Manchester encoding). In total each chip held about 6.6 megabits. Chips were delivered in plastic boxes known as \"cells\", each holding 32 chips. For delivery, ten cells were stacked, wrapped in a lightproof plastic wrapper, and then placed in a box. Boxes of cells were loaded into a hopper on the 1365 Photo-Digital Recorder unit, which would cut off the wrapper and drop the cells into a queue. When a cell reached the head of the queue it was removed and opened, chips being pulled out one at a time as needed.\n\nData was written to the chips using an electron gun, similar to the operation of a television tube. Sensors and magnets on either side of the chip holder automatically focused the beam and corrected for focus as the filament wore down through use. The gun had eight filaments instead of one, automatically rotating a new one into position as needed to allow it to work for extended periods before replacement. After the chip had been written it was moved to an automated photo processing system similar to those found at camera shops; the chip was dipped into a series of liquid-filled stations to develop, and then pulled out to dry.\n\nFlaws on the film, impossible to avoid, were addressed to some degree through the use of complex error correction codes, which used up about 30% of the overall storage capacity – thus in each line in a frame only 300 bits were user data, the remainder being used for data redundancy. This resulted in about 4.7 Mbit of usable space in a 6.6 Mbit chip. Error correction could correct for minor imperfections, but not for larger problems or bad developing, so after developing the chips were immediately passed to the 1364 Photo-Digital Reader to ensure they worked. A non-working chip was automatically discarded and another one made to replace it while the data was still in memory.\n\nData was read off the card by moving it in front of a fixed photocell. Access time was improved by laying out the data in rows that were read in both directions. The head would read off a track of data as the card moved from right to left (say), and then reverse direction and read the other side of the same track from left to right. Once it returned to its original position it would move onto the next track in the field. The term for this method of data access is \"boustrophedonic,\" from a Greek root meaning \"as the ox plows.\" Many computer printers use the same technique to avoid delays moving the print head back across the paper.\n\nOnce processed, the chips were re-inserted into the cell they had been removed from earlier. They were then moved out of the reader and into the 1351 Cell File & Control or additional storage-only 1362 Cell File units. Note the numbering; these units were intended to be shared with the 1350 system. Each file contained 75 \"tray\"s (5x5 x 3 deep) holding 30 cells each, for a total of 2,250 cells, containing 1/2 a terabit. The system installed at LLNL used one 1361 and one 1362 for a total of one terabit, but other installations typically had two more 1362's for a total of 2 terabits. Cells could be manually moved about by loading them into the front-and-bottom-most set of trays, which could be removed.\n\nSpeed of the system was fairly good, writing at about 500 kbit/s, and reading at about 2.5 Mbit/s. Cells were moved between the Files and Readers using a pneumatic tube system similar to those used to move documents around in some stores and hospitals. The system could keep up to 13 cells \"in flight\" around the system in order to minimize delays.\n\nControlling the entire system was a small computer, programmed similarly to industrial control computers with a fixed number of tasks running all the time. The controller was also tasked with translating the data to and from the host format. IBM offered the 1367 Data Controller for Control Data systems, realizing that most users with this sort of storage need had a number of CDC machines. Other Controllers were available for different host platforms.\n\n"}

It concerns former Scots Guards officer Thomas Lang and his reluctant involvement in a conspiracy involving international arms dealers, terrorists, the CIA, the MoD, beautiful women and fast motorcycles.\n\nWary of becoming another \"celebrity author\", Laurie initially submitted his manuscript under a pseudonym, only revealing his identity after it had been accepted for publication and having been persuaded by his publicist to use his real name for the sake of publicity.\n\n\"The Gun Seller\" tells the story of retired Army officer Thomas Lang, who lives a somewhat hand-to-mouth existence in London, his attention focused mainly on drinking whisky and riding his motorcycle. His income stems from a variety of bodyguard, strong-arm and mercenary jobs he undertakes, utilizing the skills he learned and contacts he made during his time in the Army.\n\nAfter being approached in Amsterdam by a man asking him to assassinate American businessman Alexander Woolf, Lang attempts to warn the intended victim at his Belgravia flat, finding Woolf gone and instead clashing with (and incapacitating) a mercenary, then encountering Woolf's daughter Sarah. Afterward Lang finds himself under intense scrutiny from both the Ministry of Defence and the Central Intelligence Agency, who claim Woolf is an international drug smuggler currently under investigation. Intrigued by the sudden interest of two government agencies, Lang attempts to track down the man who approached him in Amsterdam, unexpectedly finding him in London, and even more unexpectedly discovering that the man is Alexander Woolf himself.\n\nEventually Woolf and his daughter agree to meet Lang at dinner and answer his questions. The elder Woolf explains that he tried to hire Lang as a hitman to see if he was a \"good man\", and admits he is under investigation, but not for selling drugs. Rather, Woolf is of interest because of what he knows about a next-generation light attack helicopter. More disturbingly, Woolf and Sarah claim that a conspiracy is under way to stage a terrorist attack and subsequently promote the light helicopter by sending one in to eliminate the terrorists. Lang is skeptical, but begins to believe the story after he is kidnapped and interrogated about Woolf. He frees himself, finding a heavily tortured Alexander Woolf in a nearby room. Woolf is killed shortly thereafter as Lang makes his escape, killing his captors in the process.\n\nWith Sarah missing and now certain the conspiracy is real, Lang attempts to determine the main conspirators, aided by a friend of Sarah's named Ronnie. After some investigating he centers on a CIA Deputy Director named Barnes, who (forcibly) takes him to meet the head conspirator: billionaire Naimh Murdah. Murdah, owner of the company that manufactures the helicopter, openly admits to the plot and plainly states that Lang will be helping to carry out the terrorist attack, backing up his declaration with an open and explicit threat on Sarah's life. To illustrate his point, Murdah casually kills a CIA agent who accompanied Lang and Barnes to his home.\n\nLang is placed within a small terrorist group called the Sword of Justice as a Minnesotan named Ricky, officially to gather intelligence and minimize casualties. A Dutch politician is seemingly shot dead by Lang in Switzerland as a warm up activity by the Sword of Justice, although it was a set-up and the politician was briefed and was wearing body armour. During a brief return to London Lang encounters Sarah and confronts her regarding pictures, provided to him by his friend and handler Solomon, showing Sarah and Barnes together. Sarah admits to being a part of the conspiracy, but swears her father's death was never part of the arrangement.\n\nLang and Sword of Justice arrive in Casablanca and successfully take control of the American embassy there, holding a number of hostages. Barnes, Murdah, Sarah, and a number of other conspirators arrive in Casablanca to direct Lang and ensure the success of the plot. Lang covertly leaves the Embassy as directed, but as Murdah is talking to him Lang pulls a gun, slipped to him by Sarah as part of a plan they made in London. Lang forces Murdah into the Embassy at gunpoint and handcuffs him to a fire escape on the roof, then orders him to call off the helicopter attack. Murdah refuses, certain the attack will not come since he is in the line of fire, but Lang contends the greed of the remaining conspirators will ensure the attack goes as planned. Just as Lang predicted, the helicopter attacks, killing one of the terrorists, but before it can make another pass Lang shoots it down with a Javelin missile he smuggled into the embassy earlier.\n\nFootage of the helicopter's attack and destruction is shown worldwide via news networks covering the siege, ruining any chance of any military investing in the helicopter. Lang releases a statement (via the terrorists) to CNN outlining the conspiracy, ensuring that the plot is thwarted. The Ministry of Defence flies a tired Lang and Solomon back to England. After landing Lang is greeted by Ronnie, who managed to force the Ministry to allow her to ride with him from the airport, and makes it quite clear she is happy to see him.\n\nIn an interview found in the back of some Washington Square Press editions of the book, Laurie states that (at the time of the interview) he recently finished writing a screenplay adaptation of \"The Gun Seller\" for United Artists. An audiobook edition published by Highbridge Audio is available as of 16 October 2012, narrated by Audie Award-winner Simon Prebble, produced by Greg Lawrence at on Purpose Productions.\n\nLaurie is rumoured to have written a second book, \"The Paper Soldier\". Amazon.com announced that this novel would be published in mid-September 2007. However, as the date came and passed, Laurie's agent announced that this was a mistake on Amazon's part and that Laurie had not even written the novel yet. Amazon then stated that \"Paper Soldier\" would be published in September 2009; it wasn't. The book is listed on Amazon but remains unpublished.\n\nIn January 2009, thirteen years after the original English publication, a French translation of the novel entitled \"Tout est sous contrôle\" (\"Everything's Under Control\") was published by Sonatine, and later topped book charts in March 2009 in France. Croatian translation by Ivana Ameri entitled \"Vrlo komplicirana trgovina\" (\"A Very Complicated Trade\") was published by the Profil publisher in 2015.\n"}

It uses the famous name of the Odeon cinema circuit first introduced in Britain in 1930.\n\nThe first Odeon cinema was opened by Oscar Deutsch in 1928, in Brierley Hill, Staffordshire (now West Midlands), although initially called \"Picture House\". The first cinema to use the Odeon brand name was Deutsch's cinema at Perry Barr, Birmingham in 1930. Ten years later Odeon was part of the Rank Organisation who continued their ownership of the circuit for a further sixty years. Through a number of sales and acquisitions in the early 2000s the company was purchased by Terra Firma, which merged Odeon and UCI Cinemas to form Odeon UCI Cinemas Group. Most UCI cinemas then took the Odeon brand name in 2006. Terra Firma/UCI sold the company to AMC Theatres in November 2016. Ironically, UCI was originally formed through the merger of AMC UK and Cinema International Corporation in 1989.\n\nAs of 2016, Odeon is the largest cinema chain in the United Kingdom by market share (although the Irish cinemas were also included within this figure).\n\nOn 17 March, Odeon temporarily closed its theatres due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOdeon Cinemas was created in 1928 by Oscar Deutsch. Odeon publicists liked to claim that the name of the cinemas was derived from his motto, \"Oscar Deutsch Entertains Our Nation\", but it had been used for cinemas in France and Italy in the 1920s, and the word is actually Ancient Greek. The word \"Nickelodeon\" was coined in 1888 and was widely used to describe small cinemas in the United States starting from 1905.\n\nHowever, the company is most associated with J. Arthur Rank, the owner for the longest period in its history.\n\nThe first cinema opened by Oscar Deutsch was located in Brierley Hill, Staffordshire, England in 1928. The building has long since been demolished, but as of 2006, the former UCI cinema (built in the 1980s as an AMC multiplex) at the Merry Hill Shopping Centre in Brierley Hill was refurbished as an Odeon cinema. However, its style is more functional than that of original Odeon cinemas.\n\nThe first cinema that opened under the Odeon brand was located in Perry Barr, Birmingham. It was designed by Harry Weedon. The frontage was remodelled following damage sustained during the Second World War and, having been a bingo hall, has since been converted into a conference venue.\n\nBy 1930, Odeon was a household name and the cinemas known for their maritime-inspired Art Deco architecture. This style was first used in 1930 on the cinema at Perry Barr in Birmingham, which was bought by Deutsch to expand the chain. He liked the style so much that he commissioned the architect, Harry Weedon, to design his future buildings. George Coles was also one of their principal architects, remodelling a partially complete assembly hall in Portslade and designing his first purpose-built cinema in Upper Wickham Lane, Welling, Kent which opened on 22 October 1934 and closed on 22 October 1960. It is currently a bingo club in the Mecca chain. It featured central linear lighting, a feature that became characteristic of his work.\n\nIn 1935, Oscar Deutsch commissioned John Maltby (1910–80), a professional photographer, to photograph every cinema in the Odeon chain at that time. The resulting collection, of internal and external photographs, is held in the public archive of English Heritage and can be seen online.\n\nDeutsch sold the chain to the business interests of J. Arthur Rank, who was in the process of forming the Rank Organisation in 1938. In addition acquisitions of other cinema chains had taken place following the Rank takeover including the UK cinema operations of Paramount Pictures in 1939 and purchase of Gaumont British cinemas in 1941.\n\nBy the time of Oscar Deutsch's death in 1941, 258 Odeon had opened throughout Britain. After the sale to J. Arthur Rank Corporation, Odeon also operated a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, Odeon Theatres (Canada) Ltd., with more than a hundred cinemas in Canada, coast-to-coast. The head office of Odeon Theatres of Canada was in Toronto, and later, the north Toronto suburb of Willowdale. This business was sold in 1978 to the Canadian Theatres chain and became Canadian Odeon Theatres, then was sold again in 1984 to Cineplex Corporation, forming Cineplex Odeon, then later became known as Loews Cineplex Entertainment. It also owned fifty percent of an Australian subsidiary, Greater Union Organisation, based in Sydney, with dozens of cinemas across Australia. The Rank Organisation's share of Greater Union Organisation was sold to Amalgamated Holdings Ltd., an Australian company, also in 1984. Greater Union is now known as Event Cinemas.\n\nEach Odeon cinema had a character different from most other cinemas in the UK, often having a unique and spectacular interior. They also ran their own advertising company, called Rank Screen Advertising, in competition with the UK market leader Pearl & Dean, which it eventually overtook. Rank Screen Advertising was later rebranded as Cinema Media before being taken over by Carlton Communications and became Carlton Screen Advertising. In 2008, Odeon, along with rival chain Cineworld, bought back the company and today it is known as Digital Cinema Media.\n\nA smaller number of Odeon cinemas opened in the post-war years (Odeon Marble Arch and Odeon Elephant & Castle being notable instances), but many single-screen cinemas either closed, sub-divided into smaller screens or were converted into other uses, such as bingo.\n\nSince the turn of the century, Odeon has undergone a series of sales after the Rank Group needed cash injections to reduce their debt, firstly to Cinven which merged Odeon with Cinven's ABC Cinemas. In 2004, the chain was purchased by Terra Firma and merged with United Cinemas International to produce the largest cinema chain in Europe. As a condition of the merger (imposed by the Office of Fair Trading), Odeon's Newcastle upon Tyne, Sutton Coldfield, Poole, Quinton, Hemel Hempstead and Bromley cinemas were sold to Empire Cinemas. Many smaller, older cinemas such as Odeon Grimsby on Freeman Street were closed to keep market-share within legal limits. The remaining UCI cinemas, including Thefilmworks brands, were rebranded as Odeon from 4 November 2005.\nUCI cinemas in Ireland have also joined the Odeon chain, and while they initially retained the UCI brand name, evidence of the merger became apparent, for example when booking tickets by credit card, the name \"Odeon\" appeared. The Odeon in-house film review magazine, \"Onscreen\", was now also distributed in the UCI cinemas, retaining the Odeon logo font throughout. In August 2007, UCI launched a new Irish website with an identical layout to odeon.co.uk. This website stated that the Irish cinemas were sold to an Irish group, Entertainment Enterprises, in September 2006. This transaction went unreported in the Irish media. It also stated that the cinemas remained part of the Odeon chain under a management contract. Rank/Odeon previously ran cinemas in Ireland (including the flagship, the Savoy Cinema in O'Connell Street) until 1982, when they were purchased by Ward Anderson. In April 2008, Entertainment Enterprises announced that it purchased the Irish assets of Storm Cinemas, and as with the existing UCI chain, would be contracting the running of the cinemas to Odeon. On 31 May 2011, Odeon announced that it had bought back the UCI chain in Ireland (including the Storm Cinemas-branded locations) from Entertainment Enterprises. Odeon rebranded all of its Irish cinemas under the Odeon brand during 2012; the first rebranded cinema reopened on 27 March 2012.\n\nIn 2007 Odeon acquired ten cinemas in Italy. It is now the largest cinema chain in Europe. In March 2012, the Odeon and UCI Cinemas Group under Terra Firma's control reported a £70 million loss for the year 2011, as posted on Companies House.\n\nTerra Firma announced in February 2015 that it planned to sell Odeon and UCI Cinemas for around £1 billion.\n\nIn April 2015, the company agreed to sell its cinemas in Gerrards Cross, Esher, Muswell Hill and Barnet to its smaller rival Everyman Cinemas for £7.1 million.\n\nIn July 2016, the company was bought for $921 million by the American company AMC Theatres, which is owned by Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group. The deal received approval from the European Commission on 17 November 2016, and was completed on 30 November 2016.\n\nIn 2018 AMC Theatres bought Norwegian chain SF Kino and renamed it Odeon Kino.\n\nOn 17 March 2020, Odeon closed all of its theatres due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn 29 April 2020 Odeon Cinemas announced a ban of all films distributed by Universal Pictures after the latter announced that it would skip releasing some films in cinemas and distribute them directly on streaming and on demand services. Adam Aron, chief executive of AMC Theatres, said that the ban would apply to all 1,000 outlets worldwide after the coronavirus lockdown.\n\nThe company operates a website and mobile apps for iOS and Android, allowing customers to book tickets in advance of performances. They ceased a telephone booking service in 2014. They run their own Guest Service Centre, based in Stoke-on-Trent, sharing the building with the cinema, but operated separately. The company has a support office in Manchester, and a smaller office in London.\n\n\"Limitless\" is a nationwide scheme, where, on a twelve-month contract basis, allows members to see regular (not 3D) screenings as often as they want for a monthly fee.\n\nOdeon offers premium services for customers who are 18 years or older. It provides a fine dining experience in the Lounge at Whitelys, and a Gallery, offering a premium service, at six locations.\n\nIn 2008, Odeon made a controversial move by refusing to screen \"Rambo\" on any of its UK screens, blaming it on \"commercial differences\". In 2010 Odeon proposed a boycott of Tim Burton's \"Alice in Wonderland\" at its cinemas in the UK, Ireland and Italy, over a plan by Disney to show the film for a shorter period to allow it to release the film on DVD earlier. Following individual negotiations with Disney, Odeon, Cineworld and Vue reached agreements.\n\nOn 24 August 2012, a customer named Matt Pledger posted a complaint on Odeon's Facebook wall about his experience with the cinema, citing high ticket prices, high food prices, inattentive staff, sound bleeding through from the cinema next door, and displaying adverts on how piracy was killing film. The complaint eventually went viral, with over 275,000 'Likes' and over 23,000 comments as of 3 September 2012, as well as receiving attention from the national media, including a programme feature on BBC Radio 4.\n\n\n"}

All programs are free for accepted fellows with expenses covered; all awards carry cash awards. The National Press Foundation is affiliated with the Council of National Journalism Organizations.\n\nThe NPF was incorporated in the District of Columbia on August 5, 1975, as a 501(c) 3. Early activities included support for the Erick Friedheim Library at the National Press Club (a separate organization); grants to authors and programs on business writing for journalism school deans, at a time when there were few such courses. The NPF focused its activities over time. By 1995 it limited itself to organizing educational programs for journalists and issuing awards for accomplishment.\n\nPast presidents of NPF were Robert Alden, Frank Aukofer, Joseph Slevin, David Yount, and Bob Meyers, all former journalists.\n\nThe National Press Foundation conducts programs in Washington, D.C., around the U.S., in other countries, and online using digital technology. By 2013 NPF was conducting 35–50 days of programming annually, including webinars. Programs are specifically designed to help journalists increase their knowledge and skills in specific areas.\n\nThe Paul Miller Washington Reporting Fellowship provides nine days of programs annually for reporters new to Washington DC. Four-day long programs are keyed issues such as cancer or retirement. Capitol Hill Issues Briefings look at legislation being considered by the House or the Senate; webinars provide information and access to journalists outside Washington. Other programs are developed in response to contemporary events, such as a one-day program on the 25th anniversary of the publication of the first paper on what is now called HIV.\n\nNPF’s programs for international journalists are organized under the title of Journalist to Journalist (j2j), to emphasize that the programs are not a project of any state government (as the word “national” often conveys outside the U.S.).\n\nFrom 2002 until 2011 NPF collaborated with the International AIDS Society on 3- or 4-day conferences for 35-60 journalists to prepare them to better cover the subject back home and to prepare them to cover the conferences that would immediately follow the training. These programs were held in Barcelona (2002), Bangkok (2004), Toronto (2006), Mexico City (2008) and Vienna (2010). In 2007 NPF began conducted the same kind of training program prior to the smaller, and more scientifically-based, AIDS conferences held in Sydney (2007) and Rome (2011). NPF has also collaborated with the AIDS Vaccine Alliance on small, highly technical programs, in Paris (2009), Atlanta (2010) and Bangkok (2011).\n\nIn 2011 NPF began a collaboration with the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, in which 15-20 international journalists receive fellowships to attend a 3-day j2j program on lung health issues prior to the Union’s annual conference. In 2011 the program was held in Cancun; then in Berlin (2012), then Paris (2013).\n\nNPF adds a Train the Trainer component to its international programs, in which j2j fellows provide brief overview sessions of what they have learned for their colleagues back home.\n\nNPF webinars cover content-oriented topics as well as skills sessions. Topics have included U.S.-China trade and supply chain disruptions, reporting on COVID-19, understanding risk, etc. Skills training webinars have included sessions on using new Google tools, Twitter for journalists, finding stories in the U.S. Census, redistricting, and understanding vaccines.\n\nNPF puts all resources on its website and uses as appropriate channels on YouTube and Scribd. Of original and particular note within its resources is the \"Washington Beat Book\", a detailed look at the agencies and organizations within Washington, written by and for journalists. The resources include video, audio, graphics and all other forms of resources.\n\nNPF awards are made by a vote of individual committees, ratified by the board of directors. They include:\n\nThe NPF accepts funding from any organization that agrees to its guidelines, publicly available on its website. It funds certain activities through endowment gifts, and uses the net proceeds from its annual awards dinner for day-to-day activities. All funders are always identified. Funders have included the Knight Foundation, McCormick Tribune Foundation, Prudential Financial, Pfizer, the Lilly MDR-TB Partnership, the American University in Cairo, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, etc.\n\nNPF is governed by a volunteer board of journalists and business executives. The 25-member board sets policy and supervises the five-person staff. Recent chairs of the board include John Walcott, team leader for national Security and Foreign Affairs, Bloomberg News, 2011-2013; Jerry Seib, Washington Bureau Chief, The Wall Street Journal, 2009-2011; Susan Swain, co-president, C-SPAN, 2007-2009; Sandy Johnson, then-Washington bureau chief, The Associated Press, 2005-2007.\n\nDay-to-day operations of the foundation are vested in its staff of five people. These consist of a president, programs director, operations director, programs assistant and digital media manager.\n\nThe National Press Foundation President Emeritus is Bob Meyers, who was hired in 1993 and served as NPF President from 1995–2014. Meyers is a former reporter for the \"Washington Post\" (1976–81); former assistant city editor of the \"San Diego Union-Tribune\" (1984–89); former director of the Harvard Journalism for Advance Studies in Public Health (1989-1993) and the author of two books.

It rises in central-western Afghanistan specially from Marghab District . The river takes its name from the region of Marghab District and runs north-west towards the Bala Murghab. Reaching the oasis of Mary in the Karakum Desert of Turkmenistan, the Murghab mingles its waters with those of the Karakum Canal, a diversion of water from the Amu Darya.\n\nThe Marghab originates in central-western Afghanistan, on a plateau situated among the chain of mountains of Paropamisus, Gharjistan and Band-i Turkestan. In its higher course, oriented from east to west, and to the locality of Mukhamedkhan—i.e. over a length of —the valley of Murghab is narrow, measuring less than one kilometer in width, with steep slopes. There are narrow gorges in some places. Between Darband-i Kilrekht and Mukhammedkhan, the Murghab crosses the western part of Band-i Turkestan. It then runs toward the northwest in a deep canyon. In Mukhammedkhan, it crosses the gorges of Jaokar. After this, the valley widens somewhat gradually, reaching a width of in Turkmenistan. Beyond Mukhamedkhan, a small portion of the water of the Murghab is used for irrigation; approximately are irrigated from the Murghab in Afghanistan. The Murghab receives the waters of the Kaysar river on the right, then forms the border between Turkmenistan and Afghanistan over a length. In the territory of Turkmenistan, close to Takhta-Bazaar, the Murghab receives the Kachan river from the left bank, and further, there is the confluence of the Kushk.

He was a delegate to the Stamp Act Congress of 1765, and later a loyalist during the American Revolutionary War.\n\nRuggles was born on October 20, 1711 to Rev. Timothy Ruggles. He was grandson of Capt. Samuel Ruggles of Roxbury and Martha Woodbridge, who was a granddaughter of Governor Thomas Dudley.\n\nHe graduated from Harvard in 1732; studied law, and established himself in practice in Rochester. In 1735 he married Mrs. Bathsheba Newcomb, widow of William Newcomb and the daughter of the Hon. Melatiah Bourne of Sandwich, Massachusetts. He was a military officer during the French and Indian War, rising to the rank of brigadier general in 1758.\n\nHe served multiple terms in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, and was its speaker from 1762 to 1764. He participated in the October 1765 Stamp Act Congress as a representative of the Massachusetts General Court, and was elected its president. Called to devise a common colonial response to the Parliament's 1765 Stamp Act, Ruggles refused to sign both the Declaration of Rights and Grievances sent by the Congress to King George III and the accompanying petitions sent to both Houses of Parliament. For this, he was publicly censured by the General Court.\n\nHe subsequently became one of the leading Tories of New England. He commanded the Loyal American Association and was a Mandamus Councillor appointed by General Gage in Boston. The Loyal American Association vowed to:\n\nFrom the outset of the American Revolutionary War in 1775, he stood with the loyalists, leaving Boston soon thereafter for Nova Scotia with the British troops and accompanied Lord Howe to Staten Island. His estates were confiscated and he was named in the Massachusetts Banishment Act. In 1779 he received a grant of 10,000 acres (40 km²) of land in Wilmot, Nova Scotia, where he settled.\n\nRuggles left his daughter, Bathsheba Spooner, behind in Massachusetts. On July 2, 1778 she became the first woman executed in the newly independent United States of America. She was hanged while 5 months pregnant for the crime of plotting, with a 17 year old Continental Army soldier with whom she was having an affair (and whose child she can be presumed to have been carrying), and two British soldiers (who had deserted the British Army) the death of her husband Joshua Spooner who was savagely beaten and dumped in a well.\n\nThree of Ruggles' sons, Timothy, John, and Richard, followed him into exile and settled in Annapolis County, Nova Scotia but his three daughters and his wife did not. A grandson, also named Timothy Ruggles, was a political figure in Nova Scotia.\n\nRuggles was bothered by a hernia in later years and in August 1795 on the occasion of a visit by guests while taking them on a tour of his garden he aggravated his poor health. Four days later he died and was buried on the eastward side of the Old Trinity Church, the church which he had been a major financial contributor in Middleton, Nova Scotia. A monument was later erected to his memory by his great grand-daughter, Eliza Bayard West.\n\nRuggles has been described as a vegetarian for most of his life. It was noted that \"he drank nothing stronger than a small beer & was almost a vegetarian in a society in which gluttony was the one universal excess.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1949170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949170", "title": "Titanic (magazine)", "text": "Titanic (magazine)\n\nTitanic is a German monthly satirical magazine based in Frankfurt. It has a circulation of approximately 100,000.\n\n\"Titanic\" was founded in 1979 by former contributors and editors of \"pardon\", a satirical monthly, which the group had left after conflicts with its publisher. (\"Pardon\" ceased to exist three years later.) The founding writers and cartoonists of \"Titanic\" were mainly based in Frankfurt. They called themselves Neue Frankfurter Schule (New Frankfurt School), alluding to the Frankfurter Schule of the 1930s. The heading of \"Titanic's\" monthly reviews of humorous publications bears the portrait of philosopher Theodor W. Adorno wearing a fake goatee.\n\nAs of October 2013, the editor-in-chief of \"Titanic\" is Tim Wolff, succeeding Leo Fischer.\n\nChancellor Helmut Kohl was a favourite subject of the magazine, appearing on the front page more often than any other person. In the 1980s, \"Titanic\" coined his nickname \"Birne\", the German word for pear (accompanied with drawings of his head resembling a pear). One of \"Titanic's\" most widely known cover pages appeared in November 1989, following the Fall of the Berlin Wall. The East Germans' perceived obsession with bananas was spoofed by a \"Titanic\" cover depicting \"Zonen-Gaby (17) im Glück (FRG): My first banana\", where Gaby is shown holding a large peeled cucumber. \"Zone\" refers to the GDR's informal name \"sowjetische Besatzungs\"zone\"\" (soviet-occupied area). To make light of the prevailing public sentiment that strongly favoured German reunification, \"Titanic\" purported to oppose it. This culminated in the founding of the Titanic party \"Die PARTEI\" (\"The Party\"), whose sole agenda is to revoke reunification and to reconstruct the inner German border. The former editor-in-chief Martin Sonneborn is the party leader. In addition, \"Titanic\" changed its mission to \"The ultimate division of Germany — our commitment\".\n\n\"Titanic\" staff members have frequently engaged in activities that took aim at the media and entertainment. For example, then editor-in-chief, Bernd Fritz, made an incognito appearance at the game show \"Wetten, dass..?\", followed by his revelation of how easy it was for him to cheat on the show. In recent years, the magazine has repeatedly attracted attention, for example by taking the football world cup to Germany by bribing a FIFA delegate (see below).\n\nBefore the German federal election, 2005 \"Titanic\" was running a campaign against \"das Merkel\" (\"das\" being the neutral gender definite article) and was publicly searching for a female contender for chancellor with the slogan \"Frau? Ja, aber schön\" (\"Woman? Yes, but beautiful\").\n\n\"Titanic\" has generated a number of scandals, some of which have resulted in lawsuits against the magazine. Up to 2001, 40 plaintiffs had brought lawsuits against \"Titanic\". Politician Björn Engholm, for example, received 40,000 Deutsche Mark in compensation, and this, coupled with 190,000 DM in legal fees, drove \"Titanic\" close to bankruptcy.\n\nThe July 2012 issue of the magazine was banned by a state court in Hamburg due to its front cover being an image of Pope Benedict XVI soiling himself.\n\nIn July 2000, Martin Sonneborn (then \"Titanic's\" editor-in-chief) sent hoax bribery faxes to a number of delegates of the FIFA World championship committee. In these letters, he offered the delegates gifts if they showed their support of the German bid for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n\nBefore this incident, it had been widely expected that the tournament would take place in South Africa. However, New Zealand's representative, Charlie Dempsey, who had been instructed to vote for South Africa by the Oceania Football Confederation, abstained from voting at the last minute. His vote for South Africa would have brought the tally to 12:12, resulting in FIFA's President Sepp Blatter—who had supported South Africa's bid—having to break the tie. Dempsey was one of the eight members of the executive committee who had received Sonneborn's fax on Wednesday, the night before the vote. In his letter to Dempsey, Sonneborn promised him a cuckoo clock and Black Forest ham in exchange for Dempsey's vote for Germany:\n\nDempsey himself famously stated \"This final fax broke my neck.\" He argued that the pressure from all sides had become too much for him.\n\nIn July 2000, the biggest German tabloid \"BILD-Zeitung\" urged its readers to phone \"Titanic\" and express their outrage at damaging Germany's reputation through bribery. \"Titanic\" recorded those phone calls and published an audio CD with a selection of the funniest of them, called \"\"BILD\"-Leser beschimpfen \"Titanic\"\" (\"\"BILD\"-readers insult \"Titanic\"\").\n\nThe German soccer association threatened Sonneborn with DM 600 million (approx €300 million) in damages, requiring him to swear never again to influence a FIFA decision through the use of a fax machine.\nIn November 2005, Sonneborn published a book about the affair, \"\"Ich tat es für mein Land\" — Wie TITANIC einmal die Fußball-WM 2006 nach Deutschland holte. Protokoll einer erfolgreichen Bestechung\" (\"\"I did it for my country\" — How \"Titanic\" once brought the Football World Cup 2006 to Germany. Story of a successful bribery\"), Bombus Verlag, .\n\nIn 2006, the year the World Cup took place in Germany, \"Titanic\" arranged an exhibition called \"Wie \"Titanic\" einmal die Fußball-WM 2006 nach Deutschland holte\" (\"How \"Titanic\" once brought the Football World Cup 2006 to Germany\") in the Historical Museum of Frankfurt am Main, which displayed the events surrounding \"Titanic\"s bribery faxes.\n\n\n\n"}

After his retirement from playing, Bravo served for several years as an assistant coach in both Major League Soccer and the NCAA and was most recently Technical Director for the Colorado Rapids.\n\nBravo was a student-athlete at Santa Teresa High School in San Jose, California. He then played two years of college soccer at Foothill Community College and winning State Championships and while at Santa Clara University and helped his team to the NCAA co-championship in 1989. While he left college early, he continued to work on his education and earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Santa Clara in 1993.\n\nIn 1991, Bravo signed with the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks of the American Professional Soccer League (APSL). He earned Rookie of the Year honors that season as the Blackhawks took the APSL championship. In 1993, the Blackhawks ownership moved the team to the lower division USISL and renamed the team the San Jose Hawks. Despite the reduced team costs, the Hawks folded at the end of the 1993 season. Bravo then remained in the San Francisco area with the San Francisco Greek-Americans, winning the U.S. Open Cup in 1994. In 1995, he moved to the Monterey Bay Jaguars.

He started the July 30, 1999 game against Germany, then earned his last cap in the third-place 2-0 victory against Saudi Arabia. The U.S. won that game on the strength of goals from both Bravo and Brian McBride.\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Bravo went into coaching. He began as an assistant with the Colorado Rapids in 2002. In 2004, UCLA hired Bravo as an assistant to its men's soccer team. On June 15, 2006, he became an assistant coach with the Los Angeles Galaxy of MLS.

A student of Eugen Bleuler, he was also associated with the work of Ludwig Binswanger and Henri Ey. He was influenced by the phenomenological philosophy and the vitalistic philosophy of Henri Bergson, and by the phenomenologists Edmund Husserl and Max Scheler; therefore his work departed from classical medical and psychological models. He was a prolific author in several languages and regarded as a great humanitarian. Minkowski accepted the phenomenological essence of schizophrenia as the \"trouble générateur\" (\"generating disorder\") as he thought that it consists in a loss of \"vital contact with reality\" and shows itself as autism.\n\nMinkowski was born in Saint Petersburg, the capital of the Russian Empire, into a Jewish Polish family. He was second of the four sons of August Minkowski, a Warsaw banker and his wife, Tekla, née Lichtenbaum. When he was 7 years old, the family returned to the Polish capital where he attended school and started his medical studies at the Imperial University of Warsaw. However, due to political repression from the czarist government, the university was temporarily closed in 1905. He was obliged to continue his studies at Breslau University (3 semesters), at Göttingen University (2 semesters) and finally, at Munich University (3 semesters) where he obtained his medical degree in 1909. As a Russian subject, he went on to practice medicine in Kazan to obtain Russian certification, and while there, met his future wife, Franciszka Brokman, also a doctor and later known as 'Françoise'. They married in 1913. The couple settled in Munich, where Françoise pursued further work in psychiatry while Eugène took up the study of mathematics and philosophy, attending lectures by Alexander Pfänder and Moritz Geiger, pupils of Edmund Husserl. In Munich he became acquainted with Germanic philosophy. The outbreak of World War I forced them to seek refuge in Zürich with Minkowski's brother, Mieczysław (Michel). There, Minkowski and his wife both became assistants to Eugen Bleuler at the Burghölzli, a university clinic where Carl Gustav Jung and Ludwig Binswanger had practised earlier. In 1914 he finished a work entitled \"\"Les éléments essentiels du temps-qualité\"\" – \"The Essential Elements of Time-Quality\". At the beginning of the World War I Minkowski volunteered in the French Army in 1915 as a military medic. In 1915, the couple had a son, Alexandre Minkowski, later a pioneer of French neonatology and father of the noted orchestra conductor, Marc Minkowski, followed in 1918 by a daughter, Jeannine, a lawyer. In the war he saw action at the Battle of the Somme and at Battle of Verdun, where his bravery earned him several citations and military decorations, including the Croix de Guerre. He became an officer of the Legion of Honour and obtained French nationality. In France Minkowski came under the influence of the famous French philosopher Henri Bergson, whose views are considered unscientific and opposing the secular. Minkowski was convinced that psychopathology should be closer to philosophy and closer to individual philosopher's views. For Minkowski this philosopher was Bergson.\n\nAfter the war he said:\n\n\"During the war we were waiting for peace, hoping to take up again the life that we had abandoned. In reality, a new period began, a period of difficulties and deceptions, of setbacks and painful, often fruitless efforts to adapt oneself to new problems of existence. The calm propitious to philosophic thought was far from reborn. Long, arid, and somber years followed the war. My work lay dormant at the bottom of my drawer\".\nAfter World War I, when his enlistment came to an end, he adopted French nationality. The family moved again to Paris permanently and Minkowski returned to medicine and partially abandoned his philosophical pursuits. He worked on the perception of time as a vector in psychopathology, drawing heavily on his unpublished work on Bergson, whom he had known personally. In 1925 he became one of the co-founders of a movement and a French journal in psychiatry, known as \"\"L'Évolution psychiatrique\"\" – \"The Psychiatric Evolution\". \"\"L'Évolution psychiatrique\"\" introduced the work of Eugen Bleuler and several other psychiatrists, such as Karl Jaspers and Ludwig Binswanger. Directors of \"\"l'Ėvolution psychiatrique\"\" were A. Hesnard and R. Laforgue. Original works and critical studies in the journal have been made by messieurs R. Allendy, A. Borel, A. Ceillier, H. Claude, H. Codet, J. Damourette, A. Hesnard, R. Laforgue, M F. Minkowska, E. Minkowski, É Pichon, Robin, R. de Saussure, Schiff and J. Vinchon. Minkowski has published articles in 1925 to the first volume of \"\"L'Ėvolution psychiatrique\"\" – \"La Génèse de la Notion de Schizophrénie et ses Caractères Essentiels\" – \"Genesis of the Notion of Schizophrenia and its Essential Features\" and as a bonus he published a page about the modern history of psychiatry.\n\nIn 1926 he wrote a doctoral thesis on \"\"La notion de perte de contact avec la réalité et ses applications en psychopathologie\"\" – \"The Notion of Loss of Contact with Reality and its Applications in Psychopathology\", which was based on the works of Henri Bergson and Eugen Bleuler, and began work at Sainte-Anne's Psychiatric Hospital, a leading mental hospital in Paris. By the way, he also supported Bleuler's concept of the schizophrenic autism. Eugène Minkowski thought that autism is the patient's loss of vital contact with reality (\"perte de contact vital avec la réalité\"). He distinguished two types of the schizophrenic autism: 'rich or florid autism' (\"autisme riche\") & 'poor autism' (\"autisme pauvre\"), i.e. autism characterized by affective and cognitive \"poverty\". But Minkowski disagreed with Eugen Bleuler on several points. First, he didn't believe that the necessary component of autism is \"the predominance of the inner fantasy life\". In truth, he claimed that a typical schizophrenic patient has the \"poor autism\" which he described by the poverty of affective and cognitive processes. On that subject, he also criticized Bleuler's description of schizophrenic autism together with Emil Kraepelin. Minkowski claimed that \"rich autism\" happened only when a schizophrenic patient was equipped with an autism-independent inclination towards affective and cognitive expressivity. Just as important, Minkowski considered autism as a both fundamental and primary disorder of schizophrenia. Other psychopathological features of schizophrenia could be comprehended (\"trouble générateur\").\n\nIn 1927 he published \"\"La Schizophrénie\"\" on schizophrenia, followed in 1933, by \"\"Le Temps vécu. Études phénoménologique et psychopathologiques\"\" – \"Lived Time. Phenomenological and Psychopathological Studies\". In this, his only book published in English, Minkowski sought to use phenomenology as an approach to psychopathology. He proposed that the pathology of patients should always be interpreted in light of their subjective experience of time. Unable initially to find a publisher he funded a thousand copies himself. It was eventually published by J.L.L. d'Artrey to whom Minkowski dedicated the new edition of the work.\nMinkowski was in the Resistance during World War II and directed the work of a charity to protect children from the Shoah, which saved thousands of Jewish children. In 1946 he gave one of the first Basel lectures on the psychological suffering during Nazi persecution and went on to testify as an expert witness in numerous subsequent lawsuits. He was the author of some 250 clinical papers and publications. Eugène Minkowski died in 1972. His funeral was attended by a large crowd, including his psychiatrist friend and collaborator, Henri Ey.\n\nPhilosophically, Minkowski was influenced by Bergson and the phenomenologist Max Scheler, who had developed separate accounts of Time, (see Bergson's 1889 work \"Time and Free Will\" and his analyses of the irrational nature of time). Following Bergson's account of élan vital, Minkowski developed what he named as \"vital energy\", an account of the essence of time.\nHe was also attracted by the practice of the Swiss psychiatrist, Eugen Bleuler and attempted to synthesize ideas from psychiatry with philosophy, taking an approach similar to Karl Jaspers. He introduced phenomenology as part of his investigations into psychopathology. He sought thereby to explain the experience of patients who appeared to suffer from distortions of time and/or space. Minkowski's first research into the psychopathology of schizophrenia was inspired by Bergson and appeared in his 1927 work \"La Schizophrénie\", which he thought was \"due to a deficiency of intuition, a sense of time and to a progressive hypertrophy of the grasp of spatial factors\". Based on his dissertation, he considered that schizophrenic patients display a \"loss of vital contact with reality\" unlike others who experienced life as a \"lived synchronism\" or what he called \"syntony\", a notion borrowed from Ernst Kretschmer. According to R.D. Laing, Minkowski made \"the first serious attempt in psychiatry to reconstruct the other person's lived experience\" and was \"the first figure in psychiatry to bring the nature of phenomenological investigations clearly into view\". He is quoted on the first page of Laing's classic \"The Divided Self\":\n\n\"Je donne une œuvre subjective ici, œuvre cependant qui tend de toutes ses forces vers l'objectivité.\" I offer you a subjective work, but a work which nevertheless struggles with all its might towards objectivity.\n\nHe was awarded honorary doctorates by the University of Zurich in 1955 and the University of Warsaw in 1965.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese include:\n\n\n"}

Although he designed a large number of buildings during a long career, he is best known for his role overseeing the Art Deco designs of the Odeon Cinemas for Oscar Deutsch in the 1930s. Influenced by the work of Erich Mendelsohn and Hans Poelzig – the Odeons \"taught Britain to love modern architecture\" and form \"a body of work which, with London Underground stations, denotes the Thirties like nothing else\".\n\nWeedon was born in Handsworth, Birmingham, the son of a commercial traveller, and educated at King Edward's School in the city. He studied architecture at the Birmingham School of Art from 1904, before being articled to the architectural practice of Robert Atkinson. In 1912 at the age of 24 he was made an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects and went into partnership with Harold S. Scott, with whom he designed a cinema in Birchfield, completed in 1913, and several upmarket houses in Warwickshire.\n\nThe outbreak of World War I saw building work dry up, however, and in 1914 he volunteered as a pilot in the Royal Flying Corps, serving until 1917. On his demobilisation he set about re-establishing his architectural practice, but an affair with the wife of a neighbour resulted in a scandalous double divorce that destroyed his reputation, and he spent the following years in Leamington Spa working as a manager in the catering industry.\n\nWeedon returned to Birmingham and to architecture in 1925, quickly building up his practice designing housing estates and commercial and industrial premises. It was his work in 1932 designing the enlargement of a factory in Hockley, Birmingham for the firm of Deutsch and Brenner that brought him to the attention of Oscar Deutsch – the factory's owner's son – who was in the process of building up his Odeon chain of cinemas and was dissatisfied with the interior proposed for his cinema under construction in Warley near Birmingham. Weedon was approached by Deutsch to complete the design, but at the time his office numbered only six staff and had nobody other than Weedon himself with any cinema experience, so the young Cecil Clavering was recruited to complete the work.\n\nIt was Clavering's next cinema design, for the Odeon, Kingstanding, built in Birmingham's expanding Kingstanding suburb in 1935, that cemented the relationship between Deutsch and Weedon. Originally designed for another chain and to be called the \"Beacon\", Deutsch saw in Clavering's simple and original Art Deco design the making of the house style he sought to distinguish the Odeon chain from his rivals. The cinema was quickly bought for the Odeon group and Weedon was appointed to oversee all of the group's designs.\n\nBetween Weedon's appointment in 1934 and the outbreak of World War II in 1939 the Weedon office was to design or act as consultant architect to over 250 of Deutsch's cinemas. Not all of these were designed by the practice itself: of the thirty-six Odeons that opened in 1936 only eight were Weedon designs. Even those that were designed by the Weedon practice were not designed by Weedon himself – Weedon's role has been likened to that of an executive producer, creating the house style and maintaining consistent quality. The practice's other major notable building of the era – the \"Villa Marina\", an early British example of a house in the International Style built in Llandudno in 1936 – was designed by Weedon personally.\n\nClavering himself designed three more Odeons for Weedon after Kingstanding – in Sutton Coldfield, Colwyn Bay and Scarborough, \"one masterpiece after the other\" considered \"the finest expressions of the Odeon circuit style\". Later in 1935 however Clavering stunned Weedon by resigning to take up a job with the Office of Works. Weedon approached Clavering's former tutor who recommended Robert Bullivant as Clavering's replacement.\n\nIn March 1939, Weedon brought four of his senior staff into partnership to form the \"Weedon Partnership\". The outbreak of World War II later that year, and the take-over of the Odeon group by J. Arthur Rank on the death of Deutsch in 1942, saw cinema design work evaporate, and Weedon spent most of the war overseeing the dispersal of Birmingham's wartime industries to protect them during the Birmingham Blitz. This resulted in a wide range of contacts with the Midlands' engineering and industrial firms and the post-war era saw the Weedon Partnership focusing on the design of factories, including notable work at the British Motor Corporation's Longbridge plant and in Cowley, Oxford, and a large factory for Typhoo Tea in Digbeth, Birmingham.\n\nWeedon himself continued design work until his final illness.\n\nThe Partnership is still in business as WeedonArchitects and celebrated its centenary in 2012 with a move to new offices in Harry's Yard in the Jewellery Quarter close to Birmingham City Centre. It has maintained Harry's links with the Automotive industry with buildings for Aston Martin, Jaguar Land Rover and Toyota amongst others. The partnership has been involved in a variety of projects including ones at Brindleyplace (Birmingham), Piccadilly Place (Manchester), The Mailbox (Birmingham) and Hicking Pentecost (Nottingham).\n\nWeedon had a love of shooting and was involved in the Solihull Home Guard Rifle Club after the war. The club was formed in 1944 and Harry Weedon donated a three-quarter acre disused sand pit to the club in 1952. This became the location for the club and it still operates today as the Solihull Rifle and Pistol Club.\n\n"}

It was formerly published under the name \"Renovaré Spiritual Formation Bible\", but has been republished under \"the Life with God\" title.\n\nThere are two editions of the Bible; those with the Deuterocanonical books, and those without them. The reasoning for adding the books (according to former Renovaré president, Richard Foster) is summarized as, \"\"1. The Deuterocanonical books were part of the ancient Greek Bible, the Septuagint, which was in circulation during the time of Christ. It was the Bible of the early Church. This Bible shaped the conscious awareness of God for the first Christians. 2. The Deuterocanonical books help Christian readers understand the New Testament context—the context of Jesus' ministry as well as of the writers of the New Testament books. The people Jesus encountered and taught were in many ways spiritually formed by these writings.3. Most of the Church throughout most of her history has included the Deuterocanonical books as part of the Bible. The Eastern Orthodox Bible, the Greek Bible, the Slavonic Bible, the Anglican Bible and the Roman Catholic Bible all currently include the Deuterocanonical books. Plus, while not viewing them as Scripture, early Protestant Bibles—Luther's translation, the Great Bible of 1539, the Geneva Bible of 1560 (supported by John Calvin and John Knox), the Bishops' Bible of 1568, and the King James Bible of 1611—included the Deuterocanonical books, or \"Apocrypha,\" as something of an appendix. 4. Throughout the ages, many questions have persisted about the value of the Deuterocanonical books. Even those groups in our time who include and use the Deuterocanonicals do not give them the same authority as the primary canon. And we, the General Editors of The Life with God Bible, would not want to accord these books the same authority as revealed Scripture. Still, their role in bridging the gap between Malachi and Matthew is unquestioned and they provide marvelous insight into the way in which the first Christians understood their relationship to God. 5. The Deuterocanonical books do not affect any central doctrine of the Christian faith, but they do contain many helpful insights for spiritual formation. For this reason alone they are worth reading and can function for us today in much the same way that good sermons and devotional writings do. Of them, Luther wrote, \"Apocrypha—that is, books which are not regarded as equal to the holy Scriptures, and yet are profitable and good to read.\"\"\" The Deuterocanonical Books that appear in the Bible are the same as those translated by the NRSV. Foster, however, is incorrect in stating that the 'Anglican Bible' includes the Deuterocanonical books. (Anglican doctrine on the matter is exactly the same as the attitude he attributes to Luther, above.)\n\nEditors and contributors include Walter Brueggemann, Marva Dawn, Richard Foster, James Earl Massey, Thomas Oden, Eugene Peterson, Andrew Purves, Dallas Willard, William Willimon, and Ben Witherington III.\n"}

Spencer described the book as an \"in-depth study of the doctrine of jihad and how it is exploited today by terrorists to justify what they’re doing and to recruit and motivate new terrorists\".\n\nIn the book, Spencer discusses issues relating to radical Islam, Jihad, and Islamic terrorism, and claims that these are more serious threats to the non-Muslim world than the media and world leaders accept. Examining current events and sources from the Qur'an, he suggests that jihad, in the sense of physical violence against non-Muslims, is an inherent component of Islam and that Islamic tolerance (the tolerance of Muslims for other religions) is exaggerated by the media. He cites this as the reason for what he claims to be lack of support from the more moderate Islamic community for anti-terrorism measures and for what he claims to be their failure to openly or widely criticise Muslim extremists. He asserts that a direct reading of the Koran and texts that interpret it leads to Islamic extremism.\n\nThe book makes a number of controversial claims. These include that mosques in the United States should be monitored more closely to protect national security, and that Muslims living in Western Europe are eroding traditions of 'secularism, free enquiry and open societies'. He also makes the assertion that non-Muslims living in Muslim countries suffer legalised oppression that stems from teachings in the Qur'an.\n\nThe book was reviewed in a September 2003 article in \"Human Events\". In addition, the book was with eight other books the focus of a January 2004 article in \"The Middle East Journal\" entitled: \"The Islam Industry and Scholarship\", in which the author wrote that the book's author \"is very good at finding quotations from the Qur'an or from obscure Muslim clerics to 'prove' the danger of Islam... Spencer states that '[w]hen modern Muslims like Jaffar Umar Thalib [sic] and Usama Bin Ladin declare Jihad, Muslims take them seriously... In present-day studies of Islam, one can easily cite as a source for research 'a writer on a Muslim bulletin board.'\n\nIn June 2004, Khalid Hasan wrote in an article in Pakistan's \" Daily Times\" that the book was part of the “great Islamic conspiracy.” Hasan says that the book's opinion that Muslims in the United States have failed to “disavow terrorism and condemn the 9/11 attacks with a clear voice” is \"not correct by a long shot.\" Hasan concluded by writing: \"How one can fight such ignorance, I am unable to say.\"\n\nBat Yeor cites the book approvingly in \"Eurabia: the Euro-Arab axis\", describing it as a \"well documented\" book that examines what she believes to be calls to Jihad by Muslims in Europe. Sabina Citron says the book provides \"deep insights\" into the major tenets of political Islam, and says it should be required reading for Western leaders, alongside Hugh Fitzgerald's detailed review of the book, which appeared in \"Outpost\".\n\nIt was banned in Malaysia in 2007.\n\n"}

She then became lovers with a young soldier from the Continental Army, Ezra Ross, and became pregnant. She enlisted the assistance of Ross and two others to murder her husband. On the night of March 1, 1778, one of them beat Joshua Spooner to death and they put his body in the Spooner well. Bathsheba Spooner and the three men were soon arrested, tried for and convicted of Spooner's murder and sentenced to death.\n\nSpooner petitioned to have her execution delayed because of her pregnancy, which was first denied and then supported by some members of a group charged with examining her to verify the pregnancy. After the four were executed, a post-mortem examination revealed that she was five months pregnant. Historians have pointed out that the trial and execution may have been hastened by anti-Loyalist sentiment.\n\nBathsheba Ruggles Spooner was the daughter of Brig. Gen. Timothy Ruggles, a lawyer who had served as chief justice of the Court of Common Pleas in Worcester, Massachusetts, from 1762-64. Ruggles refused to sign the Stamp Act protest when serving as Massachusetts representative to the Stamp Act Congress in 1765. He was an avowed Loyalist. or Tory, who threatened to raise an army to protect his and other Loyalist farms and livestock against attacks by revolutionary forces. In 1775 he joined forces with the British Army in Boston.\n\nBathsheba Ruggles married Joshua Spooner on January 15, 1766. He was a well-to-do Brookfield farmer, the son of a wealthy Boston merchant. The couple lived in relative affluence in a two-story house in Brookfield. The Spooners had their first child on April 8, 1767, and three more followed between 1770-75. He was later described as an abusive man for whom his wife developed \"an utter aversion.\"\n\nIn the spring of 1777 16-year-old Ezra Ross, a soldier in the Continental Army, fell ill en route to his home in Linebrook, a village in Ipswich, Massachusetts. Bathsheba nursed him back to health. On his travels to and from army service, he visited the Spooner home in July and December 1777. On the latter occasion he stayed into the new year, traveled with Joshua Spooner on business trips and had an affair with Bathsheba. She became pregnant mid-January and began urging Ross to kill her husband. In February 1778 Ross accompanied Joshua Spooner on an extended trip to Princeton, Massachusetts. He brought along a bottle of nitric acid, given to him by Bathsheba, which he planned to use to poison Spooner. Ross backed out of the plan and returned directly to his Linebrook home.\n\nWhile Ross and Joshua Spooner were in Princeton, Bathsheba invited two runaway British soldiers—escaped prisoners of war Pvt. Williams Brooks and Sgt. James Buchanan—to stay at the Spooner home and discussed ideas for killing her husband with them. When Joshua Spooner returned home, she recruited them to assist her. She also wrote to Ross to inform him of these developments, and he returned to Brookfield on February 28. When Spooner returned home from a local tavern the following evening, Brooks committed the murder and Buchanan and Ross helped hide the body in the Spooners' well. Bathsheba distributed paper money from her husband's lockbox and articles of his clothing to the three men, who then took one of the Spooner horses to Worcester, 14 miles away.\n\nBrooks and Buchanan spent the remainder of the night drinking, and the next morning Brooks showed off Joshua Spooner's silver shoe buckles engraved with his initials. Once the murder was discovered, the three men were arrested in Worcester within 24 hours. When Ross was discovered hiding in the attic of a tavern, he asked for a confessor. The trio implicated Bathsheba Spooner and three of her household servants in the crime. Brooks was charged with the assault on Joshua Spooner, Buchanan and Ross with aiding and abetting in the murder and Bathsheba Spooner with inciting, abetting and procuring the manner and form of the murder. All were arraigned and pleaded not guilty.\n\nThis was the first capital case in the United States. Robert Treat Paine, later the first Attorney General of Massachusetts, prosecuted the case. At the trial on April 24, 1778, the household servants testified for the prosecution. Levi Lincoln, later U.S. Attorney General under Jefferson, defended the accused. Brooks and Buchanan had no defense to offer, having signed lengthy confessions. Though Ross had signed a similar confession, Lincoln argued that he had no intention of harming the deceased, was not aware of the plan until a few hours before the murder, had not assisted in the murder and pretended to support it to maintain his affair with Bathsheba. He argued that Bathsheba Spooner had a \"disordered mind,\" that her actions were irrational as evidenced by the lack of a getaway plan.\n\nAll were found guilty the next day and sentenced to death, with the executions set for June 4, 1778. Spooner petitioned for a postponement, citing her pregnancy, based on common law principle that protected the life of a fetus if it had quickened. Spooner was examined by a panel of 12 women and two male midwives. All swore that she was not \"quick with child.\" When Spooner and her confessor, the Rev. Thaddeus Maccarty, protested the report, four of the examiners joined by another midwife and Spooner's brother-in-law, Dr. John Green, conducted a second examination and supported the claim of pregnancy. The court did not accept those findings and Bathsheba Spooner was hanged alongside Ross, Brooks and Buchanan on July 2 in Worcester's Washington Square before a crowd of 5000 spectators. A post-mortem examination, performed at Spooner's request, showed that she was pregnant with \"a perfect male fetus of the growth of five months.\"\n\nHer body was claimed by her sister, Mary Ruggles Green, wife of Dr. John Green. She was buried in an unmarked grave on the Green Estate, which today is the site of Green Hill Park in Worcester, MA.\n\nShortly after the executions, on July 5, Rev. Ebenezer Parkman, the minister of the nearby town of Westborough, delivered a sermon entitled \"The Adultress Shall Hunt for the Precious Life\" in which he said:\n\nOne historian says the judgment of the first panel that examined Spooner–\"they refused to acknowledge what must have been obvious\"–and blames \"vindictiveness\". Others question the motivation of the Massachusetts Executive Council. Some suggest Spooner was executed because the community opposed her father's British Loyalist stance. John Avery Jr., the deputy secretary and leader of the Massachusetts Executive Council, who signed Spooner's death warrant, belonged to a group of Patriots called the Loyal Nine, who formed the innermost circle of the Sons of Liberty, and was a step-brother of the murder victim.\n\nThe CBS radio program \"Crime Classics\" dramatized the case in an episode entitled \"The Crime of Bathsheba Spooner\" that aired on June 15, 1953. Spooner's case was also featured in an episode of \"Deadly Women\".\n\n"}

She teaches creative writing at Stony Brook Southampton.\n\nHempel was born in Chicago, Illinois. She moved to California at age 16, which is where much of her early fiction takes place. She moved to New York City in the mid-seventies. There, she connected with writer and editor Gordon Lish, with whom she maintained a long professional relationship. She currently lives in Florida and is professor of creative writing at the University of Florida. She was the Briggs-Copeland Lecturer of English at Harvard University from 2009 to 2014. Additionally, she teaches fiction in the Low-Residency MFA Program in Writing at Bennington College. She has previously taught at Sarah Lawrence College, Duke University, The New School, Brooklyn College, and Princeton University. She is also a contributing editor at \"The Alaska Quarterly Review\".\n\nA dog enthusiast, Hempel is a founding board member of the Deja Foundation.\n\nHempel is a former student of Gordon Lish, in whose workshop she wrote several of her first stories. Lish was so impressed with her work that he helped her publish her first collection, \"Reasons to Live\" (1985), which includes \"In the Cemetery Where Al Jolson Is Buried\", the first story she ever wrote. Hempel credits Lish's influence for the lack of pressure she has felt to become a novelist rather than a short story writer. Originally published in \"TriQuarterly\" in 1983, \"In the Cemetery Where Al Jolson Is Buried\" is one of the most frequently anthologized stories in contemporary fiction.\n\nHempel has produced three other collections: \"At the Gates of the Animal Kingdom\" (1990), which includes the story \"The Harvest\"; \"Tumble Home\" (1997); and \"The Dog of the Marriage\" (2005). \"Tumble Home\" was Hempel's first novella, which she structured as a letter to an unspecified recipient and called \"the most personal thing I've ever written.\" Both \"In the Cemetery Where Al Jolson is Buried\" and \"Tumble Home\" highlight animals' ability to express emotions and draw them out of people. In an interview in \"BOMB Magazine\", Hempel explained, \"I think there's a purity of feeling there that humans can connect with if we're lucky, or if we're looking for it.\"\n\n\"The Collected Stories of Amy Hempel\" (2006) gathers all the stories from the four earlier books. She co-edited (with Jim Shepard) \"Unleashed–Poems by Writers' Dogs\" (1995), which includes contributions by Edward Albee, John Irving, Denis Johnson, Gordon Lish, Arthur Miller, and many others. She writes articles, essays, and short stories for such publications as \"Vanity Fair,\" \"Interview,\" \"BOMB\", \"GQ,\" \"ELLE,\" \"Harper's Magazine,\" \"The Quarterly\", and \"Playboy\". Hempel has participated in several conferences including The Juniper Summer Writing Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst's MFA Program for Poets & Writers. In 2015, Hempel judged a flash fiction contest for Nat. Brut magazine.\n\nGenerally termed a minimalist writer, along with Raymond Carver, Mary Robison, and Frederick Barthelme, Hempel is one of a handful of writers who has built a reputation based solely on short fiction. Hempel purposefully leaves her stories' narrators unnamed, as \"there are more possibilities when you don't pin down a person with a name and an age and a background because then people can bring something to them or take something from them.\"\n\nHempel currently teaches at the Creative Writing and Literature program at Stony Brook Southampton, in Southampton, NY.\n\nIn 2000, Hempel received the Hobson Award and was awarded with a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 2006, she was awarded a USA Fellowship grant by United States Artists, an arts advocacy foundation dedicated to the support and promotion of America's top living artists. She won the Ambassador Book Award in 2007 for her \"Collected Stories\", which was also named as one of \"The New York Times\"' Ten Best Books of the year. In 2008, she won the Rea Award for the Short Story. In 2009, she received the PEN/Malamud Award for Short Fiction along with Alistair MacLeod. In 2015, Hempel received the John William Corrington Award for Literary Excellence from Centenary College.\n\n\n"}

The rabbit is scolded and eventually punished by a fairy known as \"The Good Fairy\" (who turns the disobedient rabbit into a goon or goonie). \n\nThe poem consists of four-line sung verses separated by some spoken words. The verses are sung to the tune of French-Canadian children's song \"Alouette\" (1879), which is melodically similar to \"Down by the Station\" (1948) and \"Itsy Bitsy Spider\".\n\nThe person performing the song usually includes hand gestures, e.g. for scooping and \"bopping\". \n\nThe song has many different variations and is often passed on as childlore. Beverly Cleary's 1970 children's book \"Runaway Ralph\" mentions \"Little Rabbit Fru-Fru,\" and several other 1970 sources acknowledge \"Little Bunny Foo Foo\" as a song heard at summer camp.\n\nOne of the more popular versions of the song is:\nThe verses then repeat three more times, with the spoken verse altered to reflect Little Bunny Foo Foo's decreasing number of chances. The alteration appears in the first line of the verse, which changes to \"I'll give you two more chances\" and \"I'll give you one more chance\", in the second and third iterations, respectively.\n\nIn the fourth and final iteration, when the bunny has run out of chances, the entire spoken verse is altered as follows: \n\nSometimes \"bopping\" is replaced with \"kissing\".\n\nOne common ending has Little Bunny Foo Foo turned into a Goonie, with a pun ending \"And the moral of the story is: Hare today, goonie tomorrow.\" This form of story telling with a pun ending is also known as a feghoot.\n\nAnother variation (sung by a nursery assistant from Czechoslovakia working in Britain in the mid 1970s) goes like this:\nAnd continues as the previous version above.\n\nIn Brazil the song was translated into Portuguese by the Brazilian singer Xuxa for the album \"Xuxa Só Para Baixinhos 3 \"(\"Xuxa Only for Little Ones\"), with the name \"Coelhinho Fufu\". In it, instead of bopping the field mice on the head, he sharply kisses them and (though not said in the song lyrics) drops them, and the Good Fairy (known literally as the Fairy Godmother) gives him a long lecture, and the penalty for using up his three chances by disobeying is being turned into a duckling.\n\nIn Cori Doerrfeld's children's book \"Little Bunny Foo Foo: The Real Story\", a female Little Bunny Foo Foo is portrayed making small cakes. However, rats would constantly come and steal her desserts. This irritates her so much that she chases and pounds the rats in their heads. The fairy, who is unaware of the rats' thievery, however, blames Little Bunny Foo Foo for the pounding, and tells her to stop. The bunny tries to be peaceful but the way the rats still try to steal her delicacies make her want to go physical on them. After three warnings ignored, the fairy transforms Little Bunny Foo Foo into a giant vicious gerbil. The giant gerbil gets revenge by chasing and finally devouring the fairy. The gerbil returns home to enjoy her cakes. The attendees at her party don't seem to mind her appearance.\n\n\"Lenore, the Cute Little Dead Girl\" where Lenore plays as Little Bunny Foo Foo and gets told to stop bopping field mice on the head by the Good Fairy. She continues bopping other animals instead, and so the Good Fairy reappears and reprimands her by saying: \"No bopping ANY animals on the head!\" Lenore responds by bopping the fairy. The moral of the story was: \"Be more specific\".\n\nThe Moldy Peaches included a version of this song on their only studio album, also called \"the Moldy Peaches\".\n\nThis was used in the English dub of Episode 2 of \"Pop Team Epic\" in place of the Japanese children's folk song \"At a Quiet Lakeside\" (しずかな湖畔の).\n\nThe \"\" chapter book \"Fluttershy and the Fine Furry Friends Fair\" references the poem with a mentioned circus rabbit whose routine involves field mice.\n\nThe poem also provides part of the plot for \"The 7D\" episode \"Hop To It Dopey!\" in which Dopey attempts to halt Foo Foo's attacks on the field mice.\n\nIn the \"South Park\" episode \"Something You Can Do with Your Finger\", Butters sings \"Little Bunny Foo Foo\" to audition for a boy band.\n\nIn one children's book, illustrated by Paul Brett Johnson, the bunny picks up muddy pies and splats rats on his wagon. The Good Fairy doesn't like it when it's not polite to go around bopping folks, but the bunny gets a motorcycle and has a lasso in his hand to tie up gophers, and the second time he gets a big tractor to pick up foxes, and the third time he gets a big crawler crane to take down grizzly bears.\n\nIn Disney's \"Silly Songs\" album, the bunny appears on a pogo-stick and carrying a net while bouncing through a large meadow.\n\nThe Wiggles included a version of the song on their Do The Propeller DVD. Little Bunny Foo Foo was played by Captain Feathersword who scooped up the field mice and tickled them on the head.\n\nIllustrated children's books:\n\nMusic on CD and Cassette:\n"}
{"id": "1949228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949228", "title": "John Atkinson Grimshaw", "text": "John Atkinson Grimshaw\n\nJohn Atkinson Grimshaw (6 September 1836 – 13 October 1893) was an English Victorian-era artist now best known for his nocturnal scenes of urban landscapes.\n\nToday, he is considered one of the great painters of the Victorian era, as well as one of the best and most accomplished nightscape, and townscape, artists of all time. He was called a \"remarkable and imaginative painter\" by the critic and historian Christopher Wood in \"Victorian Painting\" (1999).\n\nGrimshaw's accuracy and attention to realism was criticised by some of his contemporaries, with one critic claiming that his paintings appeared to ‘showed no marks of handling or brushwork’, adding that ‘not a few artists were doubtful whether they could be accepted as paintings at all’. However, other contemporaries recognised his mastery of lighting and technique, and James McNeill Whistler, whom Grimshaw worked with in his Chelsea studios, stated, “I considered myself the inventor of nocturnes until I saw Grimmy’s moonlit pictures”.\n\nHis early paintings were signed \"JAG\", \"J. A. Grimshaw\", or \"John Atkinson Grimshaw\", though he finally settled on \"Atkinson Grimshaw\".\n\nHe was born 6 September 1836 in a back-to-back tenement in Park Street, Leeds to Mary and David Grimshaw. In 1856 he married his cousin Frances Hubbard (1835–1917). In 1861, at the age of 24, to the dismay of his parents, he left his job as a clerk for the Great Northern Railway to become a painter. He first exhibited in 1862, mostly paintings of birds, fruit and blossom, under the patronage of the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society. He and his wife moved in 1866 to a semi-detached villa which is now numbered 56 Cliff Road in Headingley and has a Leeds Civic Trust blue plaque, and in 1870 to Knostrop Hall. He became successful in the 1870s and rented a second home in Scarborough, which became a favourite subject.\n\nHe died on 13 October 1893 of tuberculosis and is buried in Woodhouse Cemetery, (now called St George's Fields), Leeds.\n\nSeveral of his children, Arthur E. Grimshaw (1864–1913), Louis H. Grimshaw (1870–1944), Wilfred Grimshaw (1871–1937) and Elaine Grimshaw (1877–1970) also became painters.\n\nGrimshaw's primary influence was the Pre-Raphaelites. True to the Pre-Raphaelite style, he created landscapes of accurate colour and lighting, vivid detail and realism, often typifying seasons or a type of weather. Moonlit views of city and suburban streets and of the docks in London, Hull, Liverpool and Glasgow also figured largely in his art. His careful painting and his skill in lighting effects meant that he captured both the appearance and the mood of a scene in minute detail. His \"paintings of dampened gas-lit streets and misty waterfronts conveyed an eerie warmth as well as alienation in the urban scene.\"\n\n\"Dulce Domum\" (1855), on whose reverse Grimshaw wrote, \"mostly painted under great difficulties\", captures the music portrayed in the piano-player, entices the eye to meander through the richly decorated room, and to consider the still and silent young lady who is listening. Grimshaw painted more interior scenes, especially in the 1870s, when he worked under the influence of James Tissot and the Aesthetic Movement.\n\n\"On Hampstead Hill\" is considered one of Grimshaw's finest works, exemplifying his skill with a variety of light sources, in capturing the mood of the passing of twilight into night. In his later career his urban scenes under twilight or yellow streetlighting were popular with his middle-class patrons.\n\nHis later work included imagined scenes from the Greek and Roman empires, and he painted literary subjects from Longfellow and Tennyson—pictures including \"Elaine\" and \"The Lady of Shalott\". (Grimshaw named his children after characters in Tennyson's poems.)\n\nIn the 1880s, Grimshaw maintained a London studio in Chelsea, not far from the studio of James Abbott McNeill Whistler. After visiting Grimshaw, Whistler remarked that \"I considered myself the inventor of Nocturnes until I saw Grimmy's moonlit pictures.\" Unlike Whistler's Impressionistic night scenes Grimshaw worked in a realistic vein: \"sharply focused, almost photographic\", his pictures innovated in applying the tradition of rural moonlight images to the Victorian city, recording \"the rain and mist, the puddles and smoky fog of late Victorian industrial England with great poetry.\"\n\nGrimshaw's paintings depicted the contemporary world but eschewed the dirty and depressing aspects of industrial towns. \"Shipping on the Clyde\", a depiction of Glasgow's Victorian docks, is a lyrically beautiful evocation of the industrial era. Grimshaw transcribed the fog and mist so accurately as to capture the chill in the damp air, and the moisture penetrating the heavy clothes of the few figures awake in the misty early morning.\n\nGrimshaw left behind no letters, journals, or papers. His reputation rested on, and his legacy is based on, his townscapes. There was a revival of interest in Grimshaw's work in the second half of the 20th century, with several important exhibitions devoted to it. A retrospective exhibition \"Atkinson Grimshaw – Painter of Moonlight\" ran from 16 April 2011 to 4 September 2011 at Mercer Art Gallery in Harrogate and subsequently in the Guildhall Art Gallery, London.\n\n\n\n"}

He has also played senior golf on the European Senior Tour and the U.S.-based Champions Tour.\n\nJames was born in Manchester, England and educated at Stamford School. He won the English Amateur championship at Woodhall Spa in 1974 and was a member of the Great Britain & Ireland 1975 Walker Cup team. His first professional win was the 1977 Lusaka Open and the following year he picked up the first of his eighteen wins on the European Tour at the Sun Alliance Match Play Championship. He also holds the record for the highest European Tour event round of 111 strokes at the 1978 Italian Open in Sardinia.\n\nJames never won a major championship, but he had four top-five finishes at The Open Championship. He was consistently competitive on the European Tour with twenty top-thirty finishes on the Order of Merit, including seven top-ten finishes, the best of them third place in 1979. He was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2000, but after treatment began playing golf again in 2001.\n\nJames represented Great Britain & Ireland or Europe in the Ryder Cup seven times including 1989 when Europe tied the match and retained the cup they had won in 1987, and 1995 when they won it outright. He was the European captain in the controversial \"Battle of Brookline\" in 1999, when the behaviour of the American galleries and team created a great deal of resentment in Europe, and also James' own actions during the matches drew fire from both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nPrior to the event, James controversially chose Andrew Coltart as his second captain's pick on the team, thus leaving out Nick Faldo and Bernhard Langer (veterans who were the two most successful players for the European team in Ryder Cup history). In one of the most discussed moves in the Ryder Cup, James then kept Jean van de Velde, Jarmo Sandelin and Coltart on the bench during all sixteen matches during the first two days of play, relegating them to singles matches on Sunday only. His refusal to play those three first-time players helped lead to Europe's defeat, as none of the three won their one match. On the other hand, United States captain Ben Crenshaw played all twelve players at least once during the first two days, even though Mark O'Meara only played once.\n\nJames published a best selling book about the event called \"Into the Bear Pit\" in 2000. In addition to criticising the behaviour of the Americans at Brookline, it also detailed James' clashes with some of his fellow Europeans including Faldo, the fading superstar whose merits as a potential captain's pick for the Ryder Cup had been much debated in the UK. James revealed in his book that just before the Ryder Cup began he had thrown a letter of encouragement from Faldo into the bin rather than share it with team. The controversy that this revelation aroused led to James resigning as one of Europe's Ryder Cup vice-captains for 2001.\n\nA follow-up book, called \"After the Bear Pit\", covering James' cancer and his experiences as a European Tour player, as well as further thoughts on the Ryder Cup, appeared in 2002.\n\nJames qualified to play senior golf when he turned fifty in late 2003. He chose to play mainly in the U.S. and was second in the Champions Tour Qualifying Tournament Finals that November. In 2004 he became the first European player to win one of the Champions Tour's senior majors with victory at the Ford Senior Players Championship. In 2005, he won on the Champions Tour for a second time at the ACE Group Classic and finished in the top 20 on the money list for a second consecutive season. His last full season on the Champions Tour was 2010 and he has played mainly on the European Senior Tour since then.\n\nJames has also worked as a golf commentator for the BBC.\n\nEuropean Tour playoff record (5–4)\n\nEuropean Senior Tour playoff record (2–0)\n\nCUT = missed the half-way cut (3rd round cut in 1974, 1977 and 1978 Open Championships)<br>\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place\n\n\n\"T\" = Tied\n\n\"Results not in chronological order before 2017.\n\nCUT = missed the halfway cut<br>\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place\n\nAmateur\n\nProfessional\n\n\n"}

When the paint is applied, it changes color depending on the light source and viewing angle. It was created at JDS Uniphase and is used by DuPont and PPG.\n\nThe paint system (and competing versions made by other companies) are known by a wide variety of proprietary names, including \"ChromaLusion\", \"ChromaPremier\", \"ColourShift\", \"Exclusive Line\", \"Extreme Colors\", \"Harlequin Color\", \"IllusionColor\", \"Maziora\", \"MultiTones\", \"MystiChrome\", \"Interference Fireglow\" and \"Paradis Spectrashine\".\n\nThe ChromaFlair effect is achieved by interfering with the reflection and refraction of light from the painted object's surface. The paint contains tiny synthetic flakes about one micrometer thick. The flakes are constructed of aluminium coated with glass-like magnesium fluoride embedded in semi-translucent chromium. The aluminium and chrome give the paint a vibrant metallic sparkle, while the glass-like coating acts like a refracting prism, changing the apparent color of the surface as the observer moves.\n\nChromaFlair paints contain no conventional absorbing pigments; rather, the pigment is a light interference pigment. The color observed is created entirely by the refractive properties of the flakes, analogous to the perception of rainbow colors in oil slicks.\n\nChromaFlair paint has also been used as a substitute for optically variable ink in the use of counterfeiting the currency of the United States. Counterfeiter Art Williams stamped green-silver ChromaFlair paint onto counterfeit bills to replicate the color-shifting ink on the 1996-issued $100 bill.\n\nThe ChromaFlair pigment is available in thousands of color variations. It is usually applied to items where visual appeal is important — such as motor vehicles, electric guitars and computer case mods.\n\nIn addition to paint, it can be applied as a coating, for example, on synthetic polyurethane leather, or dispersed in a resin for injection molding.\n\n\n"}

He has performed solo and led his own groups, including the Pocket Orchestra consisting of piano, trumpet, voice, and percussion. He was the first person to play weeklong engagements as a solo pianist at the Village Vanguard in New York City. He has recorded more than 70 of his jazz compositions. Hersch has been nominated for several Grammy Awards, and, as of December 2014, had been on the Jazz Studies faculty of the New England Conservatory since 1980 (with breaks).\n\nHersch was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, of Jewish parents. He began playing the piano at the age of four (under the tutelage of Jeanne Kirstein) and started composing music by eight. He won national piano competitions starting at the age of ten.\n\nHersch first became interested in jazz while at Grinnell College in Iowa. He dropped out of school and started playing jazz in Cincinnati. He continued his studies at the New England Conservatory, attracting attention from the press – \"a fine showcase for Fred Hersch\" – in a college recital. On graduation, he became a jazz piano instructor at the college.\n\nOne of Fred Hersch's earliest professional engagements was with Art Farmer in Los Angeles in 1978. Jazz critic Leonard Feather wrote that he \"showed his ability as an accompanist and soloist at the out-of-tune piano\". He played with Farmer again in 1981. In 1982, the album \"A Work of Art\" (Art Farmer Quartet, Concord Jazz CJ-179), was released, with Hersch on piano. It included two original compositions by Hersch. Leonard Feather gave it 3½ stars.\n\nIn 1980, the Fred Hersch Trio played at B. Dalton Bookseller, one of many fringe events that were an offshoot of the Newport Jazz Festival.\n\nIn 1981, he and his trio played for singer Chris Connor, who was making a comeback after completing a recovery program for alcoholism.\n\nHe played at the Kool Jazz Festival in 1981, and with Joe Henderson in the New Jazz at the Public series in the same year.\n\nIn 1983, Hersch played a duo session with bassist Ratzo Harris at the Knickerbocker Saloon, New York. \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"Mr. Hersch is a romantic. He is openly involved in what he is playing and projects this involvement with body English and facial expressions that subtly underline the sense of his music. His lines often become gently billowing waves of sound, and he rises and falls, tenses and relaxes along with them.\"\n\nIn 1983–84, Hersch played many sessions with Jane Ira Bloom in several venues, and with whom he recorded the album, \"Mighty Lights\".\n\nIn 1985, he played with the Jamie Baum Quartet.\n\nIn 1986, he played with Toots Thielemans at the Great Woods jazz festival. He played with him in several sessions the following year, and again in 1987, receiving special attention for his solos. In 1986, he taught at Berklee College of Music.\n\nHe was the pianist for the Eddie Daniels quartet in 1987 and appeared on his album, \"To Bird with Love\".\n\nIn 1988, Hersch played in Somerville, Massachusetts with his quintet at the Willow Jazz Club. The Boston Globe described him as \"an elegant, highly melodic player.\"\n\nIn 1989, Hersch played with Janis Siegel of The Manhattan Transfer and they recorded together in a studio set up in his home. His first solo piano recording came in 1993: \"Fred Hersch at Maybeck\".\n\nIn 2006, Palmetto Records released the solo CD \"Fred Hersch in Amsterdam: Live at the Bimhuis\", and released his eighth solo disc, \"Fred Hersch Plays Jobim\", in 2009.\n\nHersch's career as a performer has been enhanced by his composing activities, which are an important part of nearly all of his concerts and recordings. He has received commissions from the Gilmore Keyboard Festival, the Doris Duke Foundation, the Miller Theatre at Columbia University, the Gramercy Trio and the Brooklyn Youth Chorus. A disc of his through-composed works, \"Fred Hersch: Concert Music 2001-2006\", was released by Naxos Records.\n\nA number of Hersch's compositions have been transcribed by music publisher Edition Peters. These include \"Valentine\", \"Three Character Studies\", \"Saloon Songs\", and \"24 Variations on a Bach Chorale\".\n\nHersch was awarded a 2003 Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship for composition. In the same year, he created \"Leaves of Grass\" (Palmetto Records), a large-scale setting of Walt Whitman's poetry for two voices (Kurt Elling and Kate McGarry) and an instrumental octet; the work was presented in March 2005 at Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall as part of a six-city U.S. tour.\n\nHersch has collaborated with a variety of instrumentalists and vocalists in the worlds of jazz (Joe Henderson, Charlie Haden, Art Farmer, Stan Getz and Bill Frisell); classical (Renée Fleming, Dawn Upshaw, Joshua Bell, Christopher O'Riley, Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg); and Broadway (Audra McDonald). Hersch has accompanied jazz vocalists such as Nancy King, Norma Winstone and Kurt Elling.\n\nHersch has taught at The New School and Manhattan School of Music, and conducted a Professional Training Workshop for Young Musicians at The Weill Institute at Carnegie Hall in 2008.\n\n\nArt Farmer's \"A Work of Art\" in 1983 and two of Eddie Daniels' albums with Hersch in 1986 and 1987 preceded \"Short Stories\", a collaboration between Janis Siegel and Hersch, co-led and co-produced with arrangements by Hersch, that got a nomination for her vocal performance in 1989. In 1992 finally \"Dancing in the Dark\", his seventh trio recording and second for Chesky Records, was nominated for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance.\n\n\"Downbeat\" magazine described Hersch as \"one of the small handful of brilliant musicians of his generation.\" \"The New York Times\" described him as \"singular among the trailblazers of their art, a largely unsung innovator of this borderless, individualistic jazz – a jazz for the 21st century.\"\n\nHersch's influence has been widely felt on a new generation of jazz pianists, from former Hersch students including Brad Mehldau and Ethan Iverson of the Bad Plus, to his contemporary Jason Moran, who said: \"Fred at the piano is like LeBron James on the basketball court. He's perfection.\"\n\nIn 1993 Hersch announced publicly that he was gay and that he had been treated for HIV since 1984. He fell into a coma in 2008 for two months. When he regained consciousness, he had lost all muscular function as a result of his long inactivity and could not play the piano. After rehabilitation, he was able to play again. In 2011 he performed \"My Coma Dreams\", a stage show written and directed by Herschel Garfein about the contrast between dreams and reality.\n\nHersch has been a spokesman and fund-raiser for AIDS services and education agencies since 1993. Hersch has produced and performed on four benefit recordings and in numerous concerts for charities including Classical Action: Performing Arts Against AIDS and Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS which had raised over $250,000 as of June, 2013.

They are sometimes accentuated by low-rise jeans and crop tops.\n\nAlthough historically in the western world men have been the majority of tattoo recipients, in the early 1990s the practice gained popularity among women. Prior to the late twentieth century, women with tattoos were heavily stigmatized, and were rarely found in middle-class society. Lower-back tattoos were popularized in the early 2000s, in part owing to the influence of female celebrities, including Britney Spears, Aaliyah, Christina Ricci and Pamela Anderson. The popularity of low-rise jeans and crop tops may have also spurred the increase in lower-back tattoos. Another appeal of tattooing the lower back is that there is little fat there, lessening the chance that images will become misshapen over time. Also, the lower back is often concealed, providing women the choice of when to reveal their tattoo. Although some males have lower-back tattoos, including some celebrities, they are generally not acquired by men.\n\nWomen's lower backs are often viewed by people as an erotic body part, leading to the association of lower-back tattoos with sexuality. Lower-back tattoos are also perceived as an indication of promiscuity by some, possibly owing to media portrayals of women with tattoos. A 2011 study of media stereotypes criticized media portrayals of lower-back tattoos, arguing that they are unfairly cast as a symbol of promiscuity. There are a number of pejorative nicknames for lower-back tattoos, including \"tramp stamp\", \"slag tag\", \"bulls-eye\", and \"target\". The show \"Saturday Night Live\" seems to at least have partially played a role in bringing prejudice and shaming to the placement of the tattoo. For instance, the term \"tramp stamp\" started gaining widespread popularity after being used in one of their May 2004 skits. In another instance, the show also satirized the practice, describing a \"rub-on\" tattoo remover marketed at middle-age women who received lower-back tattoos while young. \n\nMedical practitioners who administer anesthesia have questioned whether epidural analgesia should be provided to women with lower-back tattoos. Concerns have emerged that epidural catheters may cause tattoo pigment to enter interspinous ligaments and other areas, potentially leading to health problems. There is consensus that epidural catheters should not be placed through irritated or infected tattoos. However, harm has not been clearly documented when placing epidural catheters through healthy tattooed skin; a review in the \"American Association of Nurse Anesthetists Journal\" concluded that \"epidural catheter placement through lumbar tattoos is a\npractitioner's decision based on clinical judgment\". In \"Current Opinion in Anesthesiology\", Frédéric J. Mercier and Marie-Pierre Bonnet state that the evidence for complications when placing epidural catheters is unconvincing, but advocate avoiding the practice owing to the lack of long-term evidence.\n\n\n"}

The concept of aether was used in several theories to explain several natural phenomena, such as the traveling of light and gravity. In the late 19th century, physicists postulated that aether permeated all throughout space, providing a medium through which light could travel in a vacuum, but evidence for the presence of such a medium was not found in the Michelson–Morley experiment, and this result has been interpreted as meaning that no such luminiferous aether exists.\n\nThe word (\"aithḗr\") in Homeric Greek means \"pure, fresh air\" or \"clear sky\". In Greek mythology, it was thought to be the pure essence that the gods breathed, filling the space where they lived, analogous to the \"air\" breathed by mortals. It is also personified as a deity, Aether, the son of Erebus and Nyx in traditional Greek mythology. Aether is related to \"to incinerate\", and intransitive \"to burn, to shine\" (related is the name \"Aithiopes\" (Ethiopians; see Aethiopia), meaning \"people with a burnt (black) visage\").\n\nIn Plato's \"Timaeus\" (58d) speaking about air, Plato mentions that \"there is the most translucent kind which is called by the name of aether (αἰθήρ)\" but otherwise he adopted the classical system of four elements. Aristotle, who had been Plato's student at the Akademia, agreed on this point with his former mentor, emphasizing additionally that fire has sometimes been mistaken for aether. However, in his Book \"On the Heavens\" he introduced a new \"first\" element to the system of the classical elements of Ionian philosophy. He noted that the four terrestrial classical elements were subject to change and naturally moved linearly. The first element however, located in the celestial regions and heavenly bodies, moved circularly and had none of the qualities the terrestrial classical elements had. It was neither hot nor cold, neither wet nor dry. With this addition the system of elements was extended to five and later commentators started referring to the new first one as the fifth and also called it \"aether\", a word that Aristotle had not used.\n\nAether did not follow Aristotelian physics either. Aether was also incapable of motion of quality or motion of quantity. Aether was only capable of local motion. Aether naturally moved in circles, and had no contrary, or unnatural, motion. Aristotle also noted that crystalline spheres made of aether held the celestial bodies. The idea of crystalline spheres and natural circular motion of aether led to Aristotle's explanation of the observed orbits of stars and planets in perfectly circular motion in crystalline aether.\n\nMedieval scholastic philosophers granted \"aether\" changes of density, in which the bodies of the planets were considered to be more dense than the medium which filled the rest of the universe. Robert Fludd stated that the aether was of the character that it was \"subtler than light\". Fludd cites the 3rd-century view of Plotinus, concerning the aether as penetrative and non-material. See also Arche.\n\nQuintessence is the Latinate name of the fifth element used by medieval alchemists for a medium similar or identical to that thought to make up the heavenly bodies. It was noted that there was very little presence of quintessence within the terrestrial sphere. Due to the low presence of quintessence, earth could be affected by what takes place within the heavenly bodies. This theory was developed in the 14th century text \"The testament of Lullius\", attributed to Ramon Llull. The use of quintessence became popular within medieval alchemy. Quintessence stemmed from the medieval elemental system, which consisted of the four classical elements, and aether, or quintessence, in addition to two chemical elements representing metals: sulphur, \"the stone which burns\", which characterized the principle of combustibility, and mercury, which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties.\n\nThis elemental system spread rapidly throughout all of Europe and became popular with alchemists, especially in medicinal alchemy. Medicinal alchemy then sought to isolate quintessence and incorporate it within medicine and elixirs. Due to quintessence's pure and heavenly quality, it was thought that through consumption one may rid oneself of any impurities or illnesses. In \"The book of Quintessence\", a 15th-century English translation of a continental text, quintessence was used as a medicine for many of man's illnesses. A process given for the creation of quintessence is distillation of alcohol seven times. Over the years, the term quintessence has become synonymous with elixirs, medicinal alchemy, and the philosopher's stone itself.\n\nWith the 18th century physics developments, physical models known as \"aether theories\" made use of a similar concept for the explanation of the propagation of electromagnetic and gravitational forces. As early as the 1670s, Newton used the idea of aether to help match observations to strict mechanical rules of his physics. However, the early modern aether had little in common with the aether of classical elements from which the name was borrowed. These aether theories are considered to be scientifically obsolete, as the development of special relativity showed that Maxwell's equations do not require the aether for the transmission of these forces. However, Einstein himself noted that his own model which replaced these theories could itself be thought of as an aether, as it implied that the empty space between objects had its own physical properties.\n\nDespite the early modern aether models being superseded by general relativity, occasionally some physicists have attempted to reintroduce the concept of aether in an attempt to address perceived deficiencies in current physical models. One proposed model of dark energy has been named \"quintessence\" by its proponents, in honor of the classical element. This idea relates to the hypothetical form of dark energy postulated as an explanation of observations of an accelerating universe. It has also been called a fifth fundamental force.\n\nThe motion of light was a long-standing investigation in physics for hundreds of years before the 20th century. The use of aether to describe this motion was popular during the 17th and 18th centuries, including a theory proposed by Johann II Bernoulli, who was recognized in 1736 with the prize of the French Academy. In his theory, all space is permeated by aether containing \"excessively small whirlpools\". These whirlpools allow for aether to have a certain elasticity, transmitting vibrations from the corpuscular packets of light as they travel through.\n\nThis theory of luminiferous aether would influence the wave theory of light proposed by Christiaan Huygens, in which light traveled in the form of longitudinal waves via an \"omnipresent, perfectly elastic medium having zero density, called aether\". At the time, it was thought that in order for light to travel through a vacuum, there must have been a medium filling the void through which it could propagate, as sound through air or ripples in a pool. Later, when it was proved that the nature of light wave is transverse instead of longitudinal, Huygens' theory was replaced by subsequent theories proposed by Maxwell, Einstein and de Broglie, which rejected the existence and necessity of aether to explain the various optical phenomena. These theories were supported by the results of the Michelson–Morley experiment in which evidence for the motion of aether was conclusively absent. The results of the experiment influenced many physicists of the time and contributed to the eventual development of Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\nAether has been used in various gravitational theories as a medium to help explain gravitation and what causes it. \n\nIn 1682, Jakob Bernoulli formulated the theory that the hardness of the bodies depended on the pressure of the aether.\n\nFew years later, aether was used in one of Sir Isaac Newton's first published theories of gravitation, \"Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" (the \"Principia\", 1687). He based the whole description of planetary motions on a theoretical law of dynamic interactions. He renounced standing attempts at accounting for this particular form of interaction between distant bodies by introducing a mechanism of propagation through an intervening medium. He calls this intervening medium aether. In his aether model, Newton describes aether as a medium that \"flows\" continually downward toward the Earth's surface and is partially absorbed and partially diffused. This \"circulation\" of aether is what he associated the force of gravity with to help explain the action of gravity in a non-mechanical fashion. This theory described different aether densities, creating an aether density gradient. His theory also explains that aether was dense within objects and rare without them. As particles of denser aether interacted with the rare aether they were attracted back to the dense aether much like cooling vapors of water are attracted back to each other to form water. In the \"Principia\" he attempts to explain the elasticity and movement of aether by relating aether to his static model of fluids. This elastic interaction is what caused the pull of gravity to take place, according to this early theory, and allowed an explanation for action at a distance instead of action through direct contact. Newton also explained this changing rarity and density of aether in his letter to Robert Boyle in 1679. He illustrated aether and its field around objects in this letter as well and used this as a way to inform Robert Boyle about his theory. Although Newton eventually changed his theory of gravitation to one involving force and the laws of motion, his starting point for the modern understanding and explanation of gravity came from his original aether model on gravitation.\n\n"}

Aether is the personification of the \"upper sky\". He embodies the pure upper air that the gods breathe, as opposed to the normal air (ἀήρ, \"aer\") breathed by mortals. Like Tartarus and Erebus, Aether may have had shrines in ancient Greece, but he had no temples and is unlikely to have had a cult.\n\nIn Hesiod's \"Theogony\", Aether (Light), was the son of Erebus (Darkness) and Nyx (Night), and the brother of Hemera (Day).\n\nThe Roman mythographer Hyginus, says Aether was the son of Chaos and Caligo (Darkness). According to Jan Bremmer,\n\nHyginus says further that the children of Aether and Day were Earth, Heaven, and Sea, while the children of Aether and Earth were \"Grief, Deceit, Wrath, Lamentation, Falsehood, Oath, Vengeance, Intemperance, Altercation, Forgetfulness, Sloth, Fear, Pride, Incest, Combat, Ocean, Themis, Tartarus, Pontus; and the Titans, Briareus, Gyges, Steropes, Atlas, Hyperion, and Polus, Saturn, Ops, Moneta, Dione; and three Furies – namely, Alecto, Megaera, Tisiphone.\"\n\nAristophanes states that Aether was the son of Erebus. However, Damascius says that Aether, Erebus and Chaos were siblings, and the offspring of Chronos (Father Time). According to Epiphanius, the world began as a cosmic egg, encircled by Time and Inevitability (most likely Chronos and Ananke) in serpent fashion. Together they constricted the egg, squeezing its matter with great force, until the world divided into two hemispheres. After that, the atoms sorted themselves out. The lighter and finer ones floated above and became the Bright Air (Aether and/or Uranus) and the rarefied Wind (Chaos), while the heavier and denser atoms sank and became the Earth (Gaia) and the Ocean (Pontos and/or Oceanus). See also Plato's Myth of Er.\n\nThe fifth Orphic hymn to Aether describes the substance as \"the high-reigning, ever indestructible power of Zeus,\" \"the best element,\" and \"the life-spark of all creatures.\" Though attributed to the mythological poet Orpheus who lived before the time of Homer, the likely composition of the hymns in the 6th-4th centuries BCE make them contemporary with natural philosophers, such as Empedocles, who theorized the material forces of nature as identical with the gods and superior to the anthropomorphic divinities of Homeric religion.\n\n"}

Along with her sisters Megan Alatini and Monique Cassie, she formed a band called the Nubian Angels in her early teens. The band relaunched in 2007, and have made various performances for charity in co-operation with Variety, the Children's Charity, including joining them on the 2008 Variety Bash tour, and at other charity and social events.\n\nCassie moved from New Zealand to Bondi Beach, Australia in 2008. She auditioned for \"Australian Idol\" but was not selected.\n\nCassie wanted to become an actress ever since she was five years old. She has trained in drama at the Young People's Theatre and Nathan Homestead. Because she wanted to get into acting as soon as possible, she got an agent at the age of 9, as she saw this as the first and best option to achieve her goal. Cassie got her first acting job in the New Zealand kids show \"What Now\" at the age of 11, where she starred as a field presenter.\n\nIn 1998, Cassie auditioned for the show that would give her both success and acting experience: \"The Tribe\". She auditioned for the role of the character Salene, but the producers called her and told her she had received the role of Ebony, one of the antagonistic characters on the show.\n\nOfficial filming of the first season commenced in August 1998, and lasted for six months to March 1999. The fifth and last season wrapped up principal photography on 1 March 2003.\n\nIn the period of 2004 to 2007, Cassie went on a hiatus, and took a break from acting and singing. She worked in a bank, helped out at her mother's hair braiding salon and gave birth to her first child, Rylon Ngarino Watt, on 16 September 2006.\n\nIn 2004, she auditioned for \"New Zealand Idol\". She did not make it past the second round, partly because the judges thought she had too much experience to be in the contest. Various reports have stated that Cassie was very sad and actually cried on camera, saying how mean the judges were. Cassie's brother, Miguel Cassie, was going to make a TV documentary about \"Idol\", where the rejected contestants could have a new chance. This show never saw the light of day.\n\nIn 2006 Cassie provided music for New Zealand teen series \"Karaoke High\". Though she didn't appear on the show, she provided her singing talent for the character Miri (played by Alina Transom).\n\nIn 2008 Cassie appeared in the music video for P-Money's \"Everything\", where she was dancing on the shoulders of the lead female in the music video. She also sang an impromptu performance of the Kelly Clarkson track \"A Moment Like This\" at a reunion of members of \"The Tribe\" cast, which was held on 13 September 2008. She ended the year performing on stage at the Coca-Cola Christmas in the Park 2008, where she sang \"What Time Is It?\" with fellow New Zealand entertainers Drew Neemia, Catherine Campion, Anthony Utama, Cameron Douglas and Jodie Clarke.\n\nFollowing on from her appearance in P-Money's music video for \"Everything\" in 2008, Cassie became the lead in his music video \"Angels\", where she plays the girlfriend of P-Money's who is being haunted by supernatural beings. January 2010 saw Cassie appear in \"Legend of the Seeker\", in the season 2 episode \"Resurrection\" where she played a courtesan named Bella.\n\nAs well performing in several gigs in Auckland, Cassie also featured on the P-Money album Everything, doing vocals on the track Dance With You.

This small 6.55-acre (0.026 km²) island is just offshore of South Bass Island. It is part of Put-in-Bay Township, Ottawa County, Ohio.\n\nThe rocky island is named for its resemblance to the Rock of Gibraltar.\n\nGibraltar Island became a lookout point for Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry in the fight against the British during the War of 1812. Perry and his men defeated a fleet of British sailing vessels during the famous Battle of Lake Erie on September 10, 1813. As a result, the lookout point on Gibraltar Island became known as Perry's Lookout.\n\nOwnership of the island remained with Connecticut until Pierpont Edwards, a New York City banker purchased the deed in 1807. Sandusky, Ohio, native Jay Cooke bought the island from Edwards in 1864 and immediately began construction of a 15-room Victorian-Gothic mansion (now known as Cooke Castle). The Cooke family entertained a variety of notables, such as William Tecumseh Sherman, Salmon P. Chase, Rutherford B. Hayes, Grover Cleveland, and Benjamin Harrison. Cooke's daughter, Laura Barney, sold it to Julius Stone who eventually gave it to Ohio State University.\n\nThe Ohio State University has had various research and teaching laboratories on Lake Erie since 1895, when Professor David S. Kellicott created a second-floor lab in a Sandusky, Ohio, fish hatchery. Kellicott served as the laboratory director until his death in 1898. The first courses were offered to students in 1900. The lab moved to Cedar Point and South Bass Island before settling on Gibraltar Island in Put-in-Bay. Julius Stone, a Trustee of The Ohio State University, acquired the deed in 1925 from descendants of Jay Cooke. He immediately offered the land to Ohio State. The Board of Trustees resolved that it would be named for his father, Franz Theodore Stone, a Prussian mathematician and astronomical researcher who worked for Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel after attending the Königsberg Albertina University. Though the purchase was made in 1925, the first classes did not begin until 1929, and the F. T. Stone Laboratory (known simply as Stone Lab) was dedicated on June 22, 1929, making it the oldest freshwater field station in the United States. It contains six classrooms, offices, laboratories, computing facilities, and a 100-seat auditorium. It hosts workshops for grade school students throughout the year, and full-credit college courses are offered to advanced high school students, undergraduates, and graduate students over the summer.\n\nOther buildings on Gibraltar include:\n\n"}

He read classics at the University of Nottingham, and then studied composition there with Arnold Whittall, and at the same time with Nicholas Maw. In the 1970s he taught at the University of Sussex, where he obtained a doctorate for his work on Mahler, an offshoot of his long collaboration with Deryck Cooke on the performing version of Mahler's Tenth Symphony. During this period he also worked at Aldeburgh with Benjamin Britten and Imogen Holst. His music has been published principally by Faber Music since 1976.\n\nIn 1975 his orchestral Fourth Sonata (written 1974–75) won the Scottish National Orchestra's Ian Whyte Award. Subsequent orchestral works include the widely performed \"Night Music\" (1976), Sonata No. 5: \"Landscape\" (1977–81), and a First Cello Concerto, commissioned by the BBC for the 1984 Proms: these last two have been recorded by Unicorn-Kanchana. In 1989 \"Cortège\" was given its first performance by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House under Bernard Haitink, and \"Quatrain\" by the London Symphony Orchestra and Michael Tilson Thomas. This was the first of a series of LSO commissions, followed by \"Machines and Dreams\" for their 1991 Childhood Festival, \"Memorial\" in 1993 with Mstislav Rostropovich as conductor, and a Second Cello Concerto for Rostropovich in 1996. In 1990 he made a setting of three comic poems by Wendy Cope, \"Strugnell's Haiku\". Matthews was Associate Composer with the LSO from 1992 until 1999. The orchestral version of \"Hidden Variables\" was a joint commission for the LSO and the New World Symphony Orchestra, who gave the American première in Miami under Michael Tilson Thomas in 1992; in the same year the Cleveland Orchestra gave the American première of \"Machines and Dreams\". Collins Classics released a CD of Matthews' LSO commissions in 1996 to celebrate his 50th birthday.\n\nThe BBC commission \"Broken Symmetry\" was first performed by its dedicatees, the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Oliver Knussen, in March 1992, and repeated at the 1992 Proms. It was recorded in 1994, together with the \"Fourth Sonata\" and \"Suns Dance\", by Deutsche Grammophon (a Grammy Award nomination); and it forms the third part of the huge choral/orchestral \"Renewal\", commissioned by the BBC for the 50th anniversary of Radio 3 in September 1996. \"Renewal\" received the 1997 Royal Philharmonic Society Award for large-scale composition. The Dutch première of \"Cortège\" was given in December 1998 by the Concertgebouw Orchestra under Riccardo Chailly. The ballet score \"Hidden Variables\", incorporating a new orchestral work, \"Unfolded Order\", was commissioned by the Royal Ballet for the reopening of the Royal Opera House in December 1999.\n\nColin Matthews' chamber music includes five string quartets, two oboe quartets, a Divertimento for double string quartet (1982), and a substantial body of piano music. Between 1985 and 1994 he completed six major works for ensemble: \"Suns Dance\" for the London Sinfonietta (1985, reworked for the Royal Ballet as \"Pursuit\"), \"Two Part Invention\" (1987), \"The Great Journey\" (1981–88)—re-released on NMC—\"Contraflow\", commissioned by the London Sinfonietta for the 1992 Huddersfield Festival, and two commissions for the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group, \"Hidden Variables\" (1989) and \"...through the glass\" (1994), the latter given its first performance under Simon Rattle, who also conducted it in 1998 at the Proms and in Salzburg. Matthews' music was featured at the Almeida Festival in 1988, at the Bath Festival in 1990, at Tanglewood where he was visiting composer in 1998, 1991, 2006, 2008 and 2009, at the 1998 Suntory Summer Festival in Tokyo, at the 2003 Avanti! Festival in Finland, and the 2004 Berlin Festival.\n\nThe year 2000 saw four major premières: \"Two Tributes\" for the London Sinfonietta; \"Pluto\", an addition to Holst's \"Planets\", for the Hallé Orchestra and Kent Nagano, already widely performed; \"Aftertones\", for the Huddersfield Choral Society; and \"Continuum\", a large-scale work for soprano and ensemble commissioned by the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group for Cynthia Clarey and Simon Rattle, with performances in London, Cologne, Brussels, Amsterdam, Vienna and Birmingham. In the spring of 2001 the Philharmonia orchestra gave the first performance of Matthews' Horn Concerto, with Richard Watkins and Esa-Pekka Salonen. Also in 2001 he was commissioned to write a Fanfare to open the BBC Proms. \"Reflected Images\", for Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, received its première in October 2003.\n\nColin Matthews' 60th birthday was marked by 5 performances given at the 2006 BBC Proms. Recent works have included \"Berceuse for Dresden\", written for the rebuilt Frauenkirche in Dresden and first performed there in November 2005 with the cellist Jan Vogler and the New York Philharmonic under Lorin Maazel; and \"Turning Point\", commissioned by the Concertgebouw Orchestra and given by them under Markus Stenz in January 2007. His Violin Concerto was given by Leila Josefowicz and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra under Oliver Knussen in September 2009.\n\nFrom 2001–10 Matthews was Associate Composer with the Hallé Orchestra, and is now their Composer Emeritus. During this period he wrote a number of works for them, as well as a project involving the orchestration of all 24 of Debussy's Preludes, completed in May 2007 and recorded by Sir Mark Elder on the Hallé label. \"Alphabicycle Order\", a major work for children's chorus, narrator and orchestra to poems by Christopher Reid, was premiered by the Hallé under Edward Gardner as part of the 2007 Manchester International Festival, and is also recorded on the Hallé label, together with the Horn Concerto. Commissioned by the Hallé Orchestra as part of their Mahler centenary celebrations, his \"Crossing the Alps\" for Chorus and Organ, on a text by William Wordsworth (The Prelude, Book VI), was first performed by the Hallé Choir, conducted by Markus Stenz, at the Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, in January 2010. Its German premiere, also under Stenz, was in the Philharmonie in Cologne, in January 2011, with the MDR Radio Chorus.\n\nThree works were premiered in 2011 : “Night Rides” for the London Sinfonietta; “No Man’s Land”, to a text by Christopher Reid, for the City of London Sinfonia with soloists Ian Bostridge and Roderick Williams; and “Grand Barcarolle” for the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra and Riccardo Chailly as part of their Beethoven cycle presented in Leipzig, Vienna, Paris and London in autumn 2011. “No Man’s Land” won the 2012 British Composer Award for vocal music.

{"id": "1949341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949341", "title": "Mount St Mary's College", "text": "Mount St Mary's College\n\nMount St Mary's College is an independent, co-educational, day and boarding school situated at Spinkhill, Derbyshire, near Sheffield, England. It was founded in 1842 as 'The College of the Immaculate Conception at Spinkhill' by Fr Randal Lythgoe, the Provincial Superior of the Society of Jesus (better known as the Jesuits), and is still under the trusteeship of the Society. Although most teaching staff are lay members, the school still retains its Catholic ethos and values.\n\nIts affiliated preparatory school is Barlborough Hall School, just 2.2 miles down the road.\n\nThe Jesuit mission to England began in 1580 with the secret arrival of Robert Persons, Edmund Campion, and Ralph Emerson. After Campion’s arrest the following year, Persons slipped back to the European mainland where he spent most of the rest of his life preparing others for the Jesuit mission to England. One of the first things he did was to set up a school for English boys who had no hope of receiving a Catholic education in their own country. Many of its students went on to become priests, returning to England to work and in some cases were killed when discovered by the authorities. In England, there were several clandestine schools, one of them was at Stanley Grange in Derbyshire. When this school was discovered and dispersed by the authorities, it did not cease to exist, but was moved to Spinkhill. Spinkhill had been a centre of Jesuit activity from the 1600s.\n\nThe Jesuit English Province was organised territorially into a number of \"colleges\", the North Midlands area being designated the college of the Immaculate Conception. In 1842 it was decided to found a school here in the hamlet of Spinkhill, a property of the Pole family, and that school was designated \"The College of the Immaculate Conception at Spinkhill\" after the nearby parish church. The founder of the college was Randall Lythgoe, Provincial of the Society of Jesus in England.\n\nThe college buildings date, in part, from the 16th and 17th centuries, the Sodality Chapel being the earliest remaining building. The Jesuits had a college at Holbeck Woodhouse, near Welbeck, which was raided by the soldiers of Charles II and the furnishings brought to Spinkhill. Joseph Hansom, an architect and inventor of the Hansom Cab, built the first college buildings in 1840. His son was also one of the first pupils at the college. In 1850 the Hopkins wing (girls) was constructed. The new college was begun in 1876 and completed in 1912. The school chapel, designed by Adrian Gilbert Scott, was completed in 1924 as a memorial to former pupils killed in World War I. In the atrium to the chapel can be seen more than 100 names of former pupils of the school killed in the Second Boer War, World War I, and World War II.\n\nIn 1939 Barlborough Hall, an Elizabethan manor some two miles from Spinkhill, was acquired to serve as a preparatory school to Mount St Mary's College. On 16 July 1939 the then headmaster, Ralph Baines successfully petitioned the College of Arms to give the college its own coat of arms. This is still used by the college today. During Baines' Headmastership from 1939 to 1945, he was also accepted into the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, thus establishing the college as a Public School.\n\nThe school was boys-only until the 1970s, when girls were admitted as day students for the first time in 1979. Girls were allowed to board in 1984.\n\nIn September 2006, the constitution of the college and its preparatory school, Barlborough Hall, changed to that of a charitable trust called \"Mount St Mary's\" whose board of trustees form the present governing body. The Society of Jesus formally transferred property of the two schools, their capital, business and other assets to this trust. While legally separate from the Jesuits, the college is true to the Jesuit traditions, ethos and approach to education.\n\nOld Boy of the school, Carlos Reygadas, returned to the college to film a scene for his 2012 film Post Tenebras Lux. Boys from the school were used to film a rugby match, reminiscent of the director's days as a boy at the school. The film went on to earn the director the award of Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nEach of the school years are named after different stages of elementary skills:\n\n\nEach year is now individually monitored and supported by a \"Head of Line\".\n\nThe school is split into three houses, Loyola named after Ignatius of Loyola, Xavier named after Francis Xavier, and Campion named after Edmund Campion. Every pupil is assigned to one of these houses and remains in it for the duration of their time at the college. There is a rivalry between the houses which manifests itself between inter-house competitions and sports matches. There is a Head Boy and Girl, a Deputy Head Boy and Girl, and a group of 'Captains', all of whom are in Rhetoric.\n\nFor each year, there are three forms and each form applies to one of the schools houses.\n\n\nThe school takes part in sports, notably rugby, and some of its older students have joined the England Rugby teams along with Scotland, Ireland, Italy, and many other countries. The school also receives rugby honours, winning the NatWest Schools Cup in 1994, after being runners up in 1992. The college also won the National Schools Sevens in 1988. The annual invitational Sevens competition held every year at the college sees the rugby schools from around the UK compete. There is an extremely strong sporting rivalry against fellow Catholic Public Schools, Stonyhurst College and Ampleforth College.\n\nThe school has had exchanges in the past with Notre Dame St Sigisbert in Nancy, France, and with Col·legi Casp and Joan 23 school which are in Barcelona. In 2009, the school began an exchange with St. Michel in Saint-Étienne, France.\n\nMount St Mary's Combined Cadet Forces (CCF) is 100-years-old. Pupils in Year 10 upwards can join either the Army or (from 1984 onwards) RAF section. The school CCF had its own army regiment until 1986, when it was merged into the Sherwood Foresters regiment.\n\nMusic and drama departments combine for productions, as with \"Me and My Girl\" in November 2012.\n\nThe college's art department includes design and technology, fashion, fine art, and photography.\n\nExtra-curricular activities include: shooting, airfix club, choirs, sports groups, Duke of Edinburgh, Young Enterprise, debate, textiles, creative writing, fencing, Clay Model Animation Club, and many more.\n\nThe school also holds fund-raising events for the Chikuni Mission in Zambia: the connection is known as \"Mwabuka\", a Tonga word for \"Good morning\" or \"You have arisen\".\n\nAlong with a Grade 1 Olympic Athletics track, there are nine rugby pitches, three cricket squares, an astro-turf, two sports halls, and a leisure centre with indoor swimming pool, cardio room, and two weights rooms. The latter is open to the public for use at specific times and is run by Nuffield Health.\n\nThere is a dedicated Sixth Form Centre for individual study and relaxing, bridging the gap between school and university. A new teaching and learning programme also supports and develops individual learning along with an enrichment programme – called the Bellarmine Society – of well-known outside speakers that encourages Sixth Formers to realise their ambitions.\n\nThe boarding community comprises UK and international pupils who choose to board either full-time, on a weekly or flexi basis. Hopkins House, which accommodates the girl boarders, was refurbished during summer 2016 as part of an ongoing programme of investment to maintain high standards of living for the boarders.\n\nThe school has various other facilities open to all pupils;\n\n\nOld boys (or alumni) are known as \"Mountaineers\".\n\n\n\n"}

It is the tallest structure in the Caucasus, second-tallest tower in West Asia (after Milad Tower in Tehran), eighth-tallest free-standing steel-truss tower and thirtieth-tallest tower in the world.\n\nIn the late 1960s it was decided to replace the -high TV tower in Yerevan due to the insufficient capacity of the latter.\n\nThe preparatory work on Yerevan TV tower and Tbilisi Tower, which also needed replacement, started simultaneously at the Ukrainian Institute for Steel Structures. The project leaders were Isaak Zatulovsky, Anatoli Perelmuter, Mark Grinberg, Yuri Shevernitsky, and Boris But. Tbilisi and Yerevan were the first among the Soviet capitals where towers were built. The same group later worked on the project of Kiev TV Tower though it was finished earlier than in Yerevan). Tbilisi Tower is lower, lighter and slightly tilted compared to Yerevan Tower.\n\nConstruction started in 1974 and finished 3 years later. The steel was shipped from Rustavi Metallurgical Plant in Georgia.\n\nThe old tower was moved to Leninakan, current Gyumri, where it is still functional today.\n\nThe structure of the TV tower in Yerevan is virtually divided into three parts: base, body, and antenna.\n\nThe base is a truss-steel tetrahedron that at the height of 71 metres becomes a closed-platform observation deck and technical offices. On the roof of this lower-tower basket are radio antennas. The triangular truss-steel structure continues to the height of 137 metres where a two-storey 18-metre structure in the shape of an inverted-truncated cone is situated. The lattice grid structure continues another 30 meters.\n\nIn the centre of this structure there is a concrete vertical pipe structure with a diameter of 4.2 metres, in which, among other things, the lift-shaft is hidden. The pipe projecting from the basement continues as an antenna carrier. This form was widespread in the Soviet Union with steel towers. For example, the Kiev TV tower and the Saint Petersburg TV Tower follow this construction principle.\n\nThe antenna carrier tapers (diameter per section: 4 meters, 3 meters, 2.6 meters, 1.72 meters and 0.75 meters) between five maintenance bridges to the top. The entire steel structure is painted white and international orange to comply with air safety regulations (similar to the Tokyo Tower and the Tbilisi TV Tower).\n\nThe weight of the structure is 1900 tonnes and the basement is 1170 metres above the sea level.\n\nInstallation of the tower in 1977 allowed to receive a wide variety of programs from the Moscow Central television, as well as from other Soviet Union republics. In those years the average daily length of programs broadcast by Armenian television reached twelve hours, of which two-and-a-half hours in color, including four hours and thirty-five minutes of their own programming. Ninety-six percent of the population watched the first program. In 1978 it became possible to also receive the fourth channel of the Central television in Armenia In 1978 the programs watched were news (25%), music (23%), educational (13%), pre-adult entertainment (14.5%), political (9%) and military (6%), sport (4%), movies (3.5%) and others.\n\nBy 1978, the number of TV sets reached 500 000, of which 100 000 were color. Armenian SSR was the second in the Soviet Union with the popularization of TV. The length of TV programs per day reached 19 hours. About 50% of the programs were in color and 70% were recorded. In the subsequent years Armenia became the first of the republics of the Soviet Union by the percentage of the TV audience and the volume of programs.\n\n"}

Standing at 1,640 metres (5,381 ft) it is the highest mountain in the Southern Ural section, and is featured within the South Ural Nature Reserve. \n\nYamantau is notable as the subject of claims by the United States that a secret extensive bunker complex of the Russian government or Russian Armed Forces is contained within the mountain, equivalent to the Cheyenne Mountain Complex.\n\nThe name of the mountain is derived from \"Yaman Tau\" (Яман тау), which translates to \"evil mountain\", \"bad mountain\", or \"wicked mountain\" in the local Bashkir language. \n\nYamantau, along with Kosvinsky Mountain (600 km to the north), are claimed by the United States of being home to a large secret nuclear facility or bunker, or both. Large excavation projects have been observed by U.S. satellite imagery after the fall of the Soviet Union, as recently as the late 1990s during the government of Boris Yeltsin. During the Soviet era two military garrisons, Beloretsk-15 and Beloretsk-16, and possibly a third, Alkino-2, were built on the site.

At the 2016 census, Leigh Creek had a population of 245, a 55% decrease from 550 in the previous census in 2011.\n\nSituated to the west of the northern Flinders Ranges, the current town is 13 km further south than the original town—it was moved in 1982 to allow for the expansion of the mine. As a result, most facilities and buildings in the town are only a little over thirty years old, and with relatively modern designs.\n\nThe mine and associated railway station are named Telford.\n\nThe area was named Leigh's Creek after its first settler, Harry Leigh, in 1856. Coal was discovered and small quantities mined from 1888 from an underground mine. The town to support the mine at that time was called Copley, after William Copley, an MP and Commissioner of Crown Lands. However the coal was not mined in a significant commercial manner until 1943 in an effort to make South Australia more self-sufficient for its energy needs, with less dependence on New South Wales. The premier Thomas Playford saw the need to be seen not to rely on interstate energy if he was to attract business to South Australia.\n\nThe former open cut mine operation was for low-grade, sub-bitumenous black coal which is frequently referred to as hard brown coal or just brown coal. It was transported 250 km by rail to power stations outside Port Augusta on the east side of Spencer Gulf. The coal occurs in several nested bowl-shaped seams, each several metres thick. The coalfield at Leigh Creek was operated by Alinta Energy and produced over 2.5 million tonnes a year of coal. Alinta Energy also operated the power stations at Port Augusta which were the only remaining coal-fired generators in South Australia, and the only users of coal from Leigh Creek.\n\nSince the early 1990s, more changes occurred in Leigh Creek. Massive restructuring of mining operations resulted in the reduction of a workforce of over 750 to about 200. The township also became a lot smaller. The population dropped from about 2500 in 1987 to less than 250 in the year 2016.\n\nOn 30 July 2015, Alinta Energy announced they were bringing the closure dates of all three facilities forward by 12 months, and now intended to no longer operate them past March 2017 and could shut them down as early as March 2016. On 7 October 2015, it was confirmed that the Leigh Creek mining operations would cease on 17 November 2015.\n\nIn 2015 the media announced that another coal project at Leigh Creek was in the planning process. Leigh Creek Energy Project (LCEP), proposed by the ASX listed company Leigh Creek Energy, intends to extract gas from Leigh Creek's coal seams by drilling injection and extraction wells and igniting the coal underground using a process known as in-situ coal gasification. The company has proposed that the gas would then be exported to Australia's eastern states via existing pipeline networks. An additional plant to produce ammonium nitrate fertilizer and explosives for use in the mining sector would also be built adjacent to the coal gasification plant.\n\nThe Aroona Sanctuary is one of the best examples of environmental rehabilitation in Australia. By 1985, the lands of the Aroona Sanctuary were badly degraded. Massive numbers of rabbits and feral goats depleted the native vegetation. The vegetation losses led to extensive sheet and gully erosion. Widespread soil erosion also led to rapid silting of Aroona Dam. The lands around Leigh Creek showed serious sign of desertification. Overgrazing and the unrestricted use of 4-wheel vehicles, motorbikes and horses also added to land degradation. For example, the local Pony Club occupied an area near Windy Creek. A large number of horses were left grazing uncontrolled and totally destroyed all vegetation. \"Dust devils\" originating in this area were visible from a long distance. Sand drifts started to occur and rainwater was no longer able to penetrate into the soil layer, because of the talcum powder like structure of the soil surface.\n\nA large-scale environmental rehabilitation project was started in late 1985, under the direction of Beat Odermatt, Environmental Scientist for ETSA. Rehabilitation was done by destroying rabbits and feral goats and by undertaking erosion control works, such as disk pitting and the construction of water velocity reducers. The removal of rabbits and feral goats helped the native vegetation to return. Over 1 million trees and shrubs emerged in the degraded area and silting of waterways and Aroona Dam was drastically reduced.\n\nIn 1995, the Government of South Australia declared the area around Aroona Dam a Flora and Fauna Sanctuary. Within less than 10 years, an extremely badly degraded area had recovered to a situation where it could again support a diverse range of native plants and wildlife. The programme provided proof that degraded lands can be rehabilitated. It is one of the best environmental land rehabilitations in arid areas.\n\nIn the meantime, a captive breeding programme of yellow-footed rock-wallabies at Monarto Safari Park in South Australia had become too successful. The Royal Zoological Society of South Australia and scientists from the SA Department of Environment and Heritage were looking for a suitable site for the world's first free release of captive yellow-footed rock-wallabies. The Aroona Dam Sanctuary was chosen as the best suitable site. Yellow-footed rock-wallabies once populated the Aroona Dam area. They became extinct in the area because of competition from feral goats and rabbits and predation from feral foxes and cats. Hunting of wallabies by \"local yokels\" had destroyed the last remaining animals. A programme was initiated to control potential predators such as feral cats and foxes. In 1996, a small number of captive-bred yellow-footed rock-wallabies was released in the Aroona Sanctuary. The released animals were closely monitored with the help of radio collars and keen volunteers and scientists. Monitoring was undertaken with the help of a large range of people, such as local school students, mine workers and scientists from other many Zoos around Australia and the United States of America.\n\nVarious stages of the Aroona Dam Sanctuary project became widely recognized. The project was awarded 3 SA State Landcare Awards and a Mining Industry Award for Environmental Excellency. The project had become one of Australia's most successful and most awarded environmental rehabilitation projects. The Aroona Bio-Diversity Project was also supported by Landcare National Heritage grants from the Commonwealth Government, by active support from adjoining landholders and is currently administered and funded by NRG Flinders.\n\nLand degradation has remained the biggest single environmental problem in Australia. Land degradation is also one of the biggest factors contributing to silting of rivers and creeks in Australia and subsequent water shortages in many areas.\n\nLeigh Creek Road is referred to in the John Schumann song of the same name on his 1993 album True Believers.\n\nLeigh Creek: An Oasis in the Desert, Flinders Ranges Research 1997 (Nic Klaassen)\nParliamentary Research Manager, Dr John Weste, March 2011.\nLeigh Creek Heritage, R Cameron Wilton.\nBrown, Mines of South Australia, p. 346\nLeigh Creek Manager, R Cameron Wilton, 2011-2012, Leigh Creek Town Manager, Robert Stack, 2013-current\n\n"}

She is an illegitimate daughter of King Albert II of Belgium and half-sister of King Philippe of Belgium. She belongs to the Belgian titled nobility and is legally Jonkvrouw Boël.\n\nBoël is the daughter of Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps (born 1941), whose husband was Jonkheer Jacques Boël (born 1929), a member of a noble family of industrialists (Boël Group). They divorced in 1978. Albert II of Belgium (born 1934) recognized her as his daughter after a DNA examination.\n\nBoël attended boarding school in England and Switzerland, and studied at the Chelsea School of Art and Design in London, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts in fine arts (with honours) in 1990.\n\nOn 19 October 1999, an 18-year-old Flemish schoolboy, , published his unauthorised biography of Queen Paola, \"Paola, van 'la dolce vita' tot koningin\" (\"Paola, from 'la dolce vita' to Queen\"). The book contained a statement referring to the existence of a daughter born out of wedlock to King Albert. The Belgian press made investigations into the identity of this daughter, tracing Boël. At first, both Boël and her mother refused to comment on the matter, and the palace dismissed Danneels' book as gossip and rumor.\nThe main element considered by the Belgian press as acknowledgment that Boël is the king's daughter is a short extract from the king's 1999 Christmas speech:\n\nThis Christmas feast is also the occasion for each of us to think to one's own family, to one's happy periods but also to one's difficult moments. The queen and I have remembered very happy periods but also the crisis that our couple have experienced more than 30 years ago. Together we could, very longtime ago already, surpass those difficulties and find back a deep understanding and love. This period has been recalled to us short ago. We don't wish to dwell \"(\"nous appesantir\" in French)\" on that subject which belongs to our private lives. But, if certain people who meet today similar problems could get some reasons to hope from our lived experience, we would be so happy.\n\nThe press interpret this to refer to the king's 18-year-long relationship with Sybille de Sélys Longchamps.\n\nBoël gave an interview on 15 May 2005, to the France 3 presenter Marc-Olivier Fogiel in the broadcast \"On ne peut pas plaire à tout le monde\" (\"You Can't Please Everyone\") in which she said that she is indeed Albert's daughter. She said she made a telephone call to Albert in order to receive help for her mother who was being harassed by journalists. According to her statement, Albert replied \"Leave me alone with that story. You are not my daughter,\" which she said was hurtful. She said she felt the absence of contact from him, especially because she is a mother herself. In the same interview, she alleged that when she and her mother moved to England when she was 9, Albert (not yet king) wished to divorce his wife and join them. Her mother apparently opposed this because of the political consequences for Albert. Boël added that her \"parents\" kept in touch by telephone for some years, but that this stopped some time before she was 16 (in 1984). She said her mother told her \"the truth\" about her parentage when she turned 18 in 1986.\n\nIn June 2013, Boël summoned Albert, his son Philippe (now king of Belgium) and his daughter Astrid, to appear in court. Boël hoped to use DNA tests to prove that she is Albert's daughter. As Albert enjoyed complete immunity under the law, Boël decided to summon his children as well. After the king abdicated on 21 July 2013 and no longer enjoyed immunity, Boël relaunched proceedings against him. In March 2017, the court ruled that her claim was unfounded, and her lawyers said she would take the claim to appeal.\n\nOn 5 November 2018, a court ruling was made public which instructed Albert to submit to a DNA test to determine whether he is Boël's biological father. Such DNA testing is not obligatory in Belgium, but not submitting to it is considered evidence of paternity. In January 2019, Albert appealed in cassation against the verdict, nevertheless on 16 May of the same year, Brussels's Court of Appeals sentenced the former king to pay a fine of 5000 Euros per day to Boël for every day he refuses to take a DNA-test.\n\nOn 27 January 2020, it was determined through DNA tests that King Albert II of Belgium is the father of Delphine Boël.\n\n"}

It is located to the southwest of Karnataka, to the west of Kerala and to the south of Tamil Nadu. This warm sea has a stable water temperature through the year and is rich in marine life, the Gulf of Mannar alone hosting about 3,600 species. Mangaluru, Kannur, Kozhikode, Kochi, Kollam,\nThiruvananthapuram, Tuticorin, Colombo, and Malé are the major cities on the shore of the Laccadive Sea. Kanyakumari, the southernmost tip of peninsular India, also borders this sea.\n\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Laccadive Sea as follows:\n\"On the West.\" A line running from Sadashivgad Lt. on West Coast of India () to Corah Divh () and thence down the West side of the Laccadive <nowiki>[</nowiki>Lakshadweep<nowiki>]</nowiki> and Maldive Archipelagos to the most Southerly point of Addu Atoll in the Maldives.\n\n\"On the South.\" A line running from Dondra Head in Sri Lanka to the most Southerly point of Addu Atoll.\n\n\"On the East.\" The West coasts of Sri Lanka and India.\n\n\"On the Northeast.\" Adams Bridge (between India and Sri Lanka).\nWater temperature is rather constant through the year, averaging 26–28 °С in summer and 25 °С in winter. Salinity is 34‰ (parts per thousand) in the center and northern part and up to 35.5‰ in the south. The coasts are sandy but the deeper parts are covered in silt. There are numerous coral reefs in the sea, such as the Lakshadweep islands which are made up of atolls and contain 105 coral species.\n\nThe Gulf of Mannar is known for its pearl banks of \"Pinctada radiata\" and \"Pinctada fucata\" for at least two thousand years. Pliny the Elder (23–79) praised the pearl fishery of the gulf as most productive in the world. Although extraction of natural pearls is considered too expensive in most parts of the world, it is still conducted in the gulf. Also collected in large numbers are Shankha mollusks (\"Xancus pyrum\") whose shells are used as a ritual and religious object. Other mollusks of the sea are either too scarce or not popular in the Indian society and therefore have no commercial value.\n\nAnother traditional occupation in the Laccadive Sea is fishing. The annual fish catch is 2,000 to 5,000 tonnes from the Lakshadweep islands, which is mostly constituted by tuna (about 70%) and shark. Perches, halfbeaks, Carangidae, needlefish and rays are also caught near the reefs. Shrimp, Achelata and small fish, such as \"Sprattus\", Pomacentridae and Apogonidae are widely used as a bait by the Laccadive islanders.\n\nWith about 3,600 species of flora and fauna, the Gulf of Mannar is regarded as one of the richest marine biological resources in the world. Of these 3,600 species, 44 are protected, 117 are corals, 79 crustaceans, 108 sponges, 260 mollusks, 441 fin fishes, 147 seaweeds and 17 mangroves. In 1986, a group of 21 islands and nearby waters with the total area of 560 km² were declared Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park. The park and its buffer zone were designated as a Biosphere Reserve in 1989. The Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve covers an area of 10,500 km² of ocean, islands and the adjoining coastline, and is the largest such reserve in India. Most of its area is restricted for outsiders and the access of boats is subject to strict rules, but local people continue fishing activities which they crucially depend on. About 150,000 people live in the buffer zone, and more than 70% of them depend on the coastal marine resources. There are about 125 fishing villages with 35,000 active fishers and 25,000 divers for sea cucumbers in the area, about 5,000 women collect seaweed. About 106,000 tonnes of fish were produced in the gulf in 2006, mostly oil sardines (\"Sardinella longiceps\"), lesser sardines (\"Sardinella spp.\"), ponyfish (\"Letognathus sp.\"), mackerel, penaeid shrimp, perches, squid (\"Sepioteuthis arctipinni\"), deep-sea lobster (\"Puerulus sewelli\"), crab (\"Varuna littorata\"), skates and rays. The seaweed collection aims at shallow-water species \"Gelidiella acerosa\" (\"marikozhundu passi\"), \"Gracilaria edulis\" (Agarophytes, \"Kanchi passi\"), \"Sargassum spp.\" (kattakorai), Turbinaria (Alginophyte, \"Pakoda passi\") and \"Ulva lactuca\", and is conducted between October and March. Because of National Park related restrictions, the production of seaweeds declined from 5,800 tonnes (dry weight) in 1978 to 3,250 tonnes in 2003.\n\n"}
{"id": "1949414", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949414", "title": "Kenny Rogers and The First Edition", "text": "Kenny Rogers and The First Edition\n\nKenny Rogers and the First Edition, until 1969 billed as The First Edition, were an eclectic rock band whose styles ranged from rock and roll to R&B, folk, and country. Its core members were Kenny Rogers (lead vocals and bass guitar), Mickey Jones (drums and percussion) and Terry Williams (guitar and vocals). The band formed in 1967, with folk musician Mike Settle (guitar and backing vocals) and the operatically-trained Thelma Camacho (lead vocals) completing the lineup.\n\nAs the counterculture of the 1960s was developing, the First Edition signed with Reprise Records in 1967 and had their first big hit in early 1968 with the pop-psychedelic single \"Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)\" (US No. 5). After only one more chart hit, \"But You Know I Love You\" (US No. 19), the group, newly billed as \"Kenny Rogers and the First Edition\", once again hit the top ten, this time in 1969 with the topical \"Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town\" (US No. 6, UK No.2).\n\nFor the next six years, the First Edition moved between country rock, pop and psychedelic rock, enjoying worldwide success. By the mid-1970s, frontman Kenny Rogers had embarked on a solo music career, becoming one of the top-selling country artists of all time.\n\nKenny Rogers and The First Edition were mostly made up of former members of the New Christy Minstrels who felt creatively stifled. The exception was Mickey Jones, who had been part of Bob Dylan's backing group on his first electric world tour. In 1967, with the help of Terry Williams' mother, who worked for producer and executive Jimmy Bowen, they signed with Reprise and recorded their first single together, \"I Found a Reason\", which had minor sales. Like much of the work by the original lineup, this was a distinctly contemporary composition with an intensely performed Mike Settle vocal. Settle had first come up with the idea of forming the band as his work took on the characteristics of rock. Over the previous seven years, Settle had been writing decidedly more folk-oriented songs, most notably the oft-covered \"Sing Hallelujah\".\n\nIt was their follow-up (sung by Rogers), the psychedelic single \"Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)\", that earned them their first brush with fame. The single, with an arrangement by their producer, Mike Post, had Glen Campbell playing the backward guitar intro and Mike Deasy providing various psychedelic sounds. It became a hit early in 1968, climbing to No. 5 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Terry Williams played the solo that later led Jimi Hendrix to tell Rogers that it was his favorite record. The group's next three single releases failed commercially, as did their second album. The 1968 release \"But You Know I Love You\" (composed by Settle) possessed a distinctive brass-tinged country-folk sound, broadening their fan base. In the group's rendition on \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\" that aired on 8 December 1968, the audience was unwittingly fooled into applauding too soon, right after the false ending but way before the real ending. The record peaked at No. 19 on the Hot 100 just under a year after \"Just Dropped In\" was at its \"Billboard\" summit.\n\nAccording to Mickey Jones' book \"That Would Be Me\", Thelma was fired from the group in late 1968 (soon after the release of \"But You Know I Love You\" and the aforementioned \"Smothers Brothers\" television appearance, but before the record would chart on the Hot 100), after missing too many gigs and rehearsals. For her part Thelma did not see it the same way. She has stated that while she always loved being with them in the studio, the road was too hard on her from a health and personal standpoint. Slowly growing apart from the others, Camacho began to feel restricted by the band in a number of ways. All agreed that the situation could not continue, and she was replaced by her roommate, Mary Arnold, an Iowa-born singer who beat out newcomer Karen Carpenter for the job. Thelma appears on the first three LPs plus half of the fourth album. Arnold made her debut on \"Reuben James\".\n\nBy the end of the decade Rogers had long brown hair, an earring, and pink sunglasses. Known affectionately in retrospect as \"Hippie Kenny\", Rogers had a notably smoother vocal style at the time. During mid-1969 the band scored another Top Ten hit with Mel Tillis' \"Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town\". The song was the global hit and established the First Edition's longevity in the business. Mickey's drumming was part of the hook. At Rogers' shows the song was often clapped along to, or joked around with, but it was meant seriously at the time. Telling the graphic story of a crippled veteran was admirably daring at the height of America's involvement with the war in Vietnam. The song lyrics were originally meant to address the Korean War, albeit in such a vague way that it could have referred to Korea, Vietnam, or even the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The song was picked up by some of the more attuned disc jockeys, and there was suddenly great demand to release the final track recorded for, and included on, the \"First Edition '69\" album. In order to release \"Ruby\" at the same time as the \"But You Know I Love You\" soundalike \"Once Again She's All Alone\", the group renamed themselves \"Kenny Rogers and the First Edition\". When \"Ruby\" became the hit, the name stuck. Terry later said that this made him feel like one of Gladys Knight's Pips.\n\n\"Ruby\" made them stars, and during the next two years, Kenny Rogers and the First Edition had five hits. A man Rogers at first took to be a rude fan first pitched \"Reuben James\" to Rogers at a golf match. The man, who turned out to be a song pitcher for American songwriter Alex Harvey, followed him around the greens singing the song until Rogers listened. Rogers loved the song's look at a black man raising a white boy and agreed to record it. \"Reuben James\" turned out to be another daring record; though not as big a hit as \"Ruby\", it made a big impact on the First Edition's now sizable fan base. \"Reuben James\" came out at the end of 1969, by which time Mike Settle had been gone for several months, in an effort to save his ultimately doomed marriage. During his absence he was replaced by Kin Vassy. Vassy's style was a little more edgy than Settle's, allowing the band to explore different areas. It was now that Kenny and Terry, by default, became the leaders of the band. Kenny was in charge of the records, and Terry would take control of their stage presentation. The group continued to record country, rock, and folk by fairly equal measures, blurring the lines among the genres. Along with Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash and Elvis Presley, their records in the late 1960s brought country music to the city and rock and roll to the country. Even if Jones had not also discovered Don Henley, the First Edition should get credit for being pioneers of a more modern blend of rockabilly called country rock.\n\nThe First Edition reached what was arguably the peak of their fame with \"Something's Burning\", a No. 11 hit in early 1970. A blatantly sexual song, it was slightly hindered chart-wise by the controversy surrounding it. Regardless, Kenny's soft voice on verses and rock shouting on the chorus earned the group much acclaim. \"Burning\" opened with a sample of an actual heartbeat played backward to replicate the song's rhythmic beat.\n\nMeanwhile, Terry Williams had begun to record some solo singles. A number of folk rock songs met with little success. He later switched to a more teen-oriented bubblegum sound that their manager Ken Kragen felt would appeal to his fans. Williams' \"I'm Gonna Sing You A Sad Song Susie\" was part of the First Edition's next LP \"Tell It All Brother\". The title track (also written by Harvey), which dealt with love and brotherhood, was a national top 20 hit and topped WRKO's August 13, 1970 top 30 survey for one week. It was the first of many songs Kenny would sing (e.g., his solo \"Coward Of The County\") that had elements of sadism under a gentle surface. Released a month or so after the Kent State shootings, the song drew a standing ovation the night it debuted live.\n\nIn addition to the band's continuing frequent appearances on television, songs by Kenny Rogers and the First Edition were featured in two 1970 films. First up was the never released on record \"If Nobody Loved\" for the camp political comedy \"Flap\". A few months later they recorded \"Someone Who Cares\" and \"A Poem I Wrote For Your Hair\" to appear in the soundtrack for the romantic film \"Fools\" starring Jason Robards, Jr., and Katharine Ross. The \"Fools\" (soundtrack) was released in 1971.\nAt the end of 1970, the First Edition had their seventh Top 40 hit with the Vassy-penned \"Heed the Call\". Another song about the need for brotherhood, it was seen as an uptempo counterpart to the balladry of \"Tell It All Brother.\" The next single, \"Someone Who Cares\", was taken from the \"Fools\" movie soundtrack. Though scoring high on the easy listening charts, \"Someone Who Cares\" failed to reach the pop top fifty. This ushered in a period during which the First Edition attempted to retool its image. Keyboard player John Hobbs was briefly in the lineup, but, though he played on future recordings, was not in the group long enough to appear on any album covers or publicity photos. His brief tenure was captured in the PBS television special \"Tell It All.\" The special provided an unusually in-depth look at the group, all of whom were at ease speaking in front of the camera. In mid-1971 the First Edition released a gospel single called \"Take My Hand\", which barely scraped into the bottom of the charts.\n\nAfter the success of a pilot shot in late 1970, the fall of 1971 saw Kenny Rogers and the First Edition become hosts of their own television series \"Rollin' on the River\". Later to be shortened to \"Rollin\", this was a variety show that was taped in Canada (taking advantage of recently imposed Canadian content requirements) which geared itself toward rock, blues, and folk performers and groups. Unlike the more Las Vegas-styled \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour\", \"Rollin\" was focused on harder-edged guests like Ike and Tina Turner, veterans like Bo Diddley, veteran Canadian based artists such as Ronnie Hawkins, and up and coming performers such as Jim Croce. The show also gave the First Edition a chance to do the comedy Kenny and Terry had long made a part of their act. Though it got good ratings, \"Rollin\" did have one ill side effect: the First Edition were now seen as television personalities instead of recording stars. Terry Williams' signature song, \"What Am I Gonna Do\", was to become the group's next single in late 1971. It was the first First Edition 45 not to chart since 1968.\n\nRecorded over six months in 1971, and released in March 1972, \"The Ballad of Calico\" was written by future star Michael Murphey and the First Edition's musical director and arranger Larry Cansler. Cansler replaced Hobbs on stage during this period, but despite his large creative role here, and on \"Rollin' on the River,\" he was not promoted on either as a member of the group. The album was a country rock opera about a late 19th-century mining town, but unlike most like-minded projects of the era, all of the songs were based on fact. The sleeve and booklet of this two-LP set had genuine and period-styled photos depicting the era, with all of the lyrics presented in hand-written script. The music was critically well received, with all of the group (outside of Mickey) taking at least one lead. The song chosen for a single was \"School Teacher,\" an acoustic rhythm and blues song with a lead by Kin. In retrospect it's easy to understand the probable reasons the artistically valid \"School Teacher\" didn't get past No. 91. Putting out a First Edition single where Rogers was not prominent had already shown itself to be a gamble, plus lyrics written to reflect the sexist views of the 19th century sounded odd outside of the LP's concept. \"The Ballad Of Calico\" has since picked up a large cult following, but back in 1972 it was all but ignored. Frustrated by the falling sales (the album hardly sold at all), Vassy began to let a drinking habit get out of control. According to Mickey Jones' book \"That Would Be Me,\" Vassy was fired several months after the \"Calico's\" release following a drunken backstage confrontation with Terry Williams.\n\nBy early 1972, Gene Lorenzo replaced Larry Cansler on stage and was made a full First Edition member. Jimmy Hassell joined the group about six months later to replace Kin. Lorenzo was a keyboard and piano virtuoso. Hassell was a hard rock singer similar to Vassy, and physically resembled a friend of Terry's, actor Gary Busey. Both fit in well, without making the public impression of the original members. Around the time the new members hopped on board, Rogers formed his own label, Jolly Rogers (distributed by MGM, Rogers retained the name when he started his own publishing company as a solo artist) and the group left Reprise.\n\nTheir first Jolly Rogers release was a late 1972 country LP called \"Backroads.\" The third single from the album, a version of Merle Haggard's \"Today I Started Loving You Again\" reached the lower regions of the country charts in mid-1973. Then came a soundtrack from \"Rollin'.\" Now in its second year, an album of live versions of the \"Calico\" songs and hits like \"Ruby,\" \"Reuben James\" and \"Just Dropped In\" could have sold quite well, bringing proven hits to the Jolly Rogers label at the same time. Instead, they delivered a set of cover songs, of which Kenny's remake of \"The Long and Winding Road\" and Gene and Terry's reworking of Bach's \"Joy\" were most notable. The album did not check the group's declining sales, and the TV show was soon canceled. The group increasingly played on the county fair circuit.\n\nIt was decided that a new image far away from their TV persona was required. \"Monumental\" tried to give them just this. Combining a wide variety of styles, it ranged from a Rogers-written rocker about prostitute \"Morgana Jones\" (later rerecorded by Rogers for his album \"The Gambler\" in 1978) to the nostalgic \"42nd Street.\" The later compared the New York of 1973 to the Broadway of the 1930s. As he would continue to do in his solo career, Rogers cloaked some mature subject matter with a gentle delivery. The Dr. John-inspired medley of Alex Harvey compositions \"The Hoodooin' of Miss Fannie Deberry\" (also re-recorded by Rogers for \"The Gambler\") and \"The Ritual\", was the LP's centerpiece. Though in tune with other music of the day, \"Monumental\" was one of their biggest sales failures in the United States, but in New Zealand it went gold. Following on the local success of \"Rollin'\" and the understated ballad \"Lady, Play Your Symphony,\" Kenny's rocking nursery rhyme \"Lena Lookie\" went to number six, and the group embarked on three New Zealand tours over the next two years. A documentary of their first trip, in late 1973, was aired as a 1975 TV special, \"Rollin Through New Zealand\".\n\nAs their domestic popularity continued to decline, Terry wanted to focus on the hard rockers that had done so well for them overseas. Kenny disagreed, wanting a more conservative agenda. Kenny admitted in his book \"Making It with Music,\" that he perhaps should not have complained about MGM's poor distribution on a radio show, but despite their mounting problems, New Zealand continued to consider the First Edition as superstars. The problem was that they had to go halfway around the world to benefit from their success, and travel expenses ate a big chunk out of their profits. As a thank you they put together an album called \"I'm Not Making My Music for Money\" especially for their New Zealand fans. An LP of this title was to have come out in the US but MGM rejected it. The US LP was basically going to be the same but with two new cuts replacing the two songs reused from \"Monumental.\" Despite the retreads, the album did show continued development. A mix of new songs and remakes (possibly done because some songs were not available in New Zealand), \"Love Woman\" was now a hard rock jam featuring Jimmy on lead. This arrangement was borrowed from the band's stage performances of Bill Haley's \"Rockin' Through the Rye\". The ballads \"Dirty Work\" and \"Daddy Was a Traveling Man\" were a return to the more adult style of Terry's early work. \"Making Music for Money\" (another song remade for \"The Gambler\") is a song about art vs. commerce that Jimmy Buffett later covered. It was the band's ironic last single. It charted well, but again only in New Zealand.\n\nA last-ditch effort to jumpstart their domestic careers was done in late 1974 when they filmed a television movie called \"The Dream Makers\". A drama about the music biz, they played the group Catweazel. It was a small role with only Kenny and Mickey speaking any major lines. Despite the film giving them a chance to perform recent songs, the exposure did not halt their decline. Kenny had become short on money by 1974, and was in debt when he decided to hawk guitar lesson records on a commercial.\n\nWanting to give a solo career a shot, Terry left in the late spring of 1975. Kenny was upset but agreed to it, succeeding in getting Kin to come back so they could fill their pending engagements. Though he was hired to stay permanently, the reunion with Vassy did not go well and he ended up playing only one night. This more or less marked the point where the First Edition agreed to split. Mickey, realizing that it was time to move on, was the first to decide to leave in order to pursue his other dream, which was acting. Though the group would finish their pending obligations, Kenny began recording as a solo act that fall. The First Edition played their last scheduled shows in the fall of 1975 at Harrah's in Reno. Without Mickey Jones there were a few First Edition gigs in early 1976, done as a favor to Kenny who had not yet formed his solo band. Kenny later said that writing the song \"Sweet Music Man\" made him cut his hair and let it go gray, plus get rid of the earring. The song may have played a part in his future middle of the road image, but the change did not happen until almost a year after it was written. Mary Arnold often sang \"Sweet Music Man\" on the First Edition's post Terry Williams gigs and Kenny also tried the lead out a few times. This was to become one of Rogers' most covered compositions, and he himself had a No. 9 country hit with it in the fall of 1977. Though unrecorded, \"Sweet Music Man\" marked the end of the First Edition as a creative entity.\n\nConsidering the band's then low profile, Kenny Rogers had an uncertain future when he signed a solo deal to United Artists in 1975. Searching for a new image, he soon developed a more middle-of-the-road, gravel-voiced style. For the rest of the decade and beyond he had hit after hit. \"Lucille\" was the first of no less than a combined 25 number 1 country and pop singles after he left the group. During his time with UA (later taken over by Liberty) he topped the country and pop album charts for a grand total of 90 weeks and sold more records than anyone in country music. In 1983 his status as one of the world's top stars (of any musical genre) was confirmed when RCA signed him for an advance sum of US$20 million, for six albums. Kenny Rogers continued to tour, including classic material by the First Edition in his performances, before retiring in 2017. In April 2013, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Rogers died on March 20, 2020.\n\nThelma Camacho did a few solo records in the 1960s and 1970s and one LP in 1980. She moved to Europe in the 1980s and lost contact with the rest of the group until 2010. Thelma also recorded in Europe under the name Tess Ivie (the latter being her husband's last name). Today, she lives in California and runs a jewelry store.\n\nMary Arnold married singer Roger Miller, after the two were introduced by Rogers, and now looks after his estate. She had performed with him for many years, and in 2009 was inducted into the Iowa Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame.\n\nKin Vassy died of lung cancer on June 23, 1994. He scored two top 40 hit singles as a country singer, but his solo career never really took off. He often worked with Kenny in the 1980s and his trademark scream enlivens hits like \"Blaze Of Glory\". In 1980 he released the single \"Makes Me Wonder (If I Ever Said Goodbye)\"; Kenny Rogers sang the backing vocals. The song was not a hit, but the following year Kenny recorded his own version of the song for his popular \"Share Your Love\" album, produced by Lionel Richie; Vassy sang the back up on Kenny's version. He also worked with Frank Zappa and Elvis Presley. Two years after he died, Martina McBride had a No. 28 hit on the U.S. country survey with the Vassy penned \"Phones Are Ringing (All Over Town)\".\n\nGene Lorenzo performed for some years with country star Lee Greenwood, then some more years with Kathy Mattea. When Greenwood fired his band in 1987, Kenny asked Gene if he would like to join his stage band \"Bloodline\" until he found a new group. Lorenzo stayed for roughly six months. He is still listed as a working musician.\n\nTerry Williams had one easy listening hit in 1980 called \"Blame It On The Night,\" but it was on a small label. He worked extensively with Kenny in the 1980s and managed Kenny's successful Lion Share recording studios. Today Terry is mostly retired, on a farm in the Southeast. He now composes and sings Christian music.\n\nKin and Terry fronted a new First Edition in 1993–94. They continued on a few months after Vassy's death, but the circumstances were now too downbeat and they disbanded several months later. It was to be an attempt at relaunching the group as a contemporary country band who also played their hits. Terry's younger brother Ress played the drums.\n\nHaving continued to write and perform, Mike Settle opened for the First Edition on their 1973 trek to New Zealand. He would go on to write several songs for the group's solo records over the years. By the 1980s, Mike had a lower profile in the music industry, and later became a journalist. Now basically retired, his songs (\"But You Know I Love You\" in particular) continue to be covered by new artists.\n\nJimmy Hassell worked for Anne Murray for a while and after Mary married Roger Miller he worked with them as well. He released one self-titled solo LP in 1976 which was reissued with one new song in 1978, and also wrote commercial jingles. His biggest success as a solo artist came in 1977 when he produced the award-winning production show \"Sassy Class\" at the Stardust hotel. He died on January 6, 2004.\n\nMickey Jones became the most visible member next to Kenny. Focused more on acting, he was in many films and television shows over the years, including films such as \"Sling Blade\" and \"The Fighting Temptations\". He also had a role in Tim Allen's \"Home Improvement\" for two seasons. He died on February 7, 2018.\n\nJohn Hobbs stayed in touch with the group and worked with Kenny, Terry, and Kin on Rogers' early 1980s solo work as well as other projects at Lion Share. He has remained an active session musician and arranger.\n\nThe groups' long time arranger Larry Cansler had a successful career in the studios in Los Angeles scoring many movies (including \"The Gambler\" series), variety shows, (\"the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\") and many national commercials. He now lives in Arizona and continues to compose for symphony orchestras.\n\nIn 1980, a compilation of some of the First Edition's greatest hits and album cuts, titled \"Shine On\", was issued in the United Kingdom; it sold fairly well but was overshadowed by \"The Kenny Rogers Singles Album\", a Kenny Rogers solo greatest hits collection that, in addition to his solo hits, featured reworkings of the group's best known songs. \nCurrently there are many compilations of their work in print on various labels, some miscredited to Kenny alone with picture not of the period.\n\n\"Live Vegas '72\" is the first new First Edition music to be released since 1974. The recording was a Kin Vassy era performance of an unknown date. Jimmy is oddly credited and there are other basic mistakes on the cover.\n\nThe band scored a total of 11 hit singles and eight hit albums on the Billboard charts.\n\nOn April 10, 2010, Kenny, Mike, Mickey, Terry, Mary, and Gene reunited as part of the \"Kenny Rogers: The First 50 Years\" TV special. This was filmed at the Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut. They were joined by Wynonna Judd on a rendition of \"Just Dropped In\".\n\nThe First Edition semi-reunited with Rogers several times in 2014-2015 when he was elected to the Country Music Hall Of Fame. These were brief press conferences and performances only.\n\n\nNote: all View Video releases were originally issued on VHS in the early nineties.\n\nNumerous releases with miscellaneous Rollin' footage have come out in Europe and Australia. They are of dubious legality and were all were quickly pulled from the market.\n\n\n\n"}

A motion control system is extensively used in a variety of fields for automation purposes, including precision engineering, micromanufacturing, biotechnology, and nanotechnology. The main components involved typically include a motion controller, an energy amplifier, and one or more prime movers or actuators. Motion control may be open loop or closed loop. In open loop systems, the controller sends a command through the amplifier to the prime mover or actuator, and does not know if the desired motion was actually achieved. Typical systems include stepper motor or fan control. For tighter control with more precision, a measuring device may be added to the system (usually near the end motion). When the measurement is converted to a signal that is sent back to the controller, and the controller compensates for any error, it becomes a Closed loop System.\n\nTypically the position or velocity of machines are controlled using some type of device such as a hydraulic pump, linear actuator, or electric motor, generally a servo. Motion control is an important part of robotics and CNC machine tools, however in these instances it is more complex than when used with specialized machines, where the kinematics are usually simpler. The latter is often called General Motion Control (GMC). Motion control is widely used in the packaging, printing, textile, semiconductor production, and assembly industries.\nMotion Control encompasses every technology related to the movement of objects. It covers every motion system from micro-sized systems such as silicon-type micro induction actuators to micro-siml systems such as a space platform. But, these days, the focus of motion control is the special control technology of motion systems with electric actuators such as dc/ac servo motors. Control of robotic manipulators is also included in the field of motion control because most of robotic manipulators are driven by electrical servo motors and the key objective is the control of motion.\n\nThe basic architecture of a motion control system contains:\n\nThe interface between the motion controller and drives it control is very critical when coordinated motion is required, as it must provide tight synchronization.

Later interfaces capable of motion control include Ethernet/IP, Profinet IRT, Ethernet Powerlink, and EtherCAT.\n\nCommon control functions include:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1949450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949450", "title": "Variable data printing", "text": "Variable data printing\n\nVariable data printing (VDP) (also known as variable information printing (VIP) or variable imaging (VI)) is a form of digital printing, including on-demand printing, in which elements such as text, graphics and images may be changed from one printed piece to the next, without stopping or slowing down the printing process and using information from a database or external file. For example, a set of personalized letters, each with the same basic layout, can be printed with a different name and address on each letter. Variable data printing is mainly used for direct marketing, customer relationship management, advertising, invoicing and applying addressing on selfmailers, brochures or postcard campaigns.\n\nVDP is a direct outgrowth of digital printing, which harnesses computer databases and digital print devices and highly effective software to create high-quality, full color documents, with a look and feel comparable to conventional offset printing. Variable data printing enables the mass customization of documents via digital print technology, as opposed to the 'mass-production' of a single document using offset lithography. Instead of producing 10,000 copies of a single document, delivering a single message to 10,000 customers, variable data printing could print 10,000 unique documents with customized messages for each customer.\n\nThe returns for variable printing vary from double the normal return at the basic level to 10–15 times the return for fully variable jobs. This naturally depends on content and the relevancy of that content, but the technique presents an effective tool for increasing ROI on marketing campaigns.\n\nThere are several levels of variable printing. The most basic level involves changing the salutation or name on each copy much like mail merge. More complicated variable data printing uses 'versioning', where there may be differing amounts of customization for different markets, with text and images changing for groups of addresses based upon which segment of the market is being addressed. Finally there is full variability printing, where the text and images can be altered for each individual address. All variable data printing begins with a basic design that defines static elements and variable fields for the pieces to be printed. While the static elements appear exactly the same on each piece, the variable fields are filled in with text or images as dictated by a set of application and style rules and the information contained in the database.\n\nThere are three main operational methodologies for variable data printing.\n\nIn one methodology, a static document is loaded into printer memory. The printer is instructed, through the print driver or raster image processor (RIP) to always print the static document when sending any page out to the printer driver or RIP. Variable data can then be printed on top of the static document. This methodology is the simplest way to execute VDP, however its capability is less than that of a typical mail merge.\n\nA second methodology is to combine the static and variable elements into print files, prior to printing, using standard software. This produces a conventional (and potentially huge) print file with every image being merged into every page. A shortcoming of this methodology is that running many very large print files can overwhelm the RIP's processing capability. When this happens, printing speeds might become slow enough to be impractical for a print job of more than a few hundred pages.\n\nA third methodology is to combine the static and variable elements into print files, prior to printing, using specialized VDP software. This produces optimized print files, such as PDF/VT, PostScript or PPML, that maximize print speed since the RIP only needs to process static elements once.\n\nThere are many software packages available to merge text and images into VDP print files. Some are stand-alone software packages, however most of the advanced VDP software packages are actually plug-in modules for one or more publishing software packages such as Adobe Creative Suite.\n\nBesides VDP software, other software packages may be necessary for VDP print projects. Mailing software is necessary in the United States (United States Postal Service) and Canada to take advantage of reduced postage for bulk mailing. Used prior to the VDP print file creation, mailing software presorts and validates and generates bar codes for mailing addresses. Pieces can then be printed in the proper sequence for sorting by postal code. In Canada, Canada Post now offers a 'Machineable' personalized mail category which does not require addresses to be sorted into any specific order before mailing; therefore reducing the need for specialized sorting software to obtain optimal postage rates. \n\nSoftware to manage data quality (e.g. for duplicate removal or handling of bad records) and uniformity may also be needed. In lieu of purchasing software, various companies provide an assortment of VDP-related print file, mailing and data services.\n\nThe difference between variable data printing and traditional printing is the personalization that is involved. Personalization allows a company to connect to its customers. Variable data printing is more than a variable name or address in a printed piece; in the past, a variable name would have been effective, because it was a new concept at the time. In today’s world, personalization has to reflect what the customer values. In order for VDP to be successful, the company must know something about the customer. For example, a customer who loves baseball receives a VDP postcard with an image of their favorite baseball player. The postcard is effective, because the customer is more likely to read what is on it. An example of an ineffective VDP piece would be to mail a postcard to the same customer with an image of a soccer player. If the customer has no interest in soccer, then he or she may or may not pay attention to the postcard. The idea is to add value to the customer through the ability to relate to them. Personalization allows a company to relate, communicate, and possibly start a relationship with a prospective customer and to maintain a relationship with their current customers. A prospect that is converted to a customer can then be converted to a loyal customer. Companies want to create loyal customers, and variable data printing can help gain these types of customers, along with quality work and service.\n\nAnother benefit is the increase in the response rate and response time. Because personalization catches the attention of the consumer, the response rate of a mail campaign increases. Personalization also increases the response time, because the mailed piece has an effect on the consumer. This effect causes the consumer to respond quicker. A mailed piece that is not eye-catching may be put down and forgotten until a later time, so it may take weeks before a response is received.\n\nVariable data printing can be combined with other platforms – such as PURLS, email blasts, and QR codes; all three platforms are considered marketing tools. Many people have found the benefit of combining all of these platforms in order to have a successful campaign. Email blasts and PURLS allow a company to find out information about their consumer. An email blasts usually doesn’t contain much personalization, but it can. The bulk of the personalization would be seen in a PURL. A PURL is a personalized uniform resource locator (URL). In short, it is a landing page. It is also where most of the knowledge about the consumer will be gained. The email blasts will contain a PURL, which will lead the consumer to a personalized page. The PURL is where a company can gain information about the consumer through the requested information. The QR code can be added to a mailed piece. It works like an email blasts. It directs the consumer to a website. The integration of these three platforms can help a campaign.\n\nThe origin of the term variable data printing is widely credited to Frank Romano, Professor Emeritus, School of Print Media, at the College of Imaging Arts and Sciences at Rochester Institute of Technology. Mr. Romano does not explicitly take credit for coining the term\nbut points to his use of it as early as 1969 and its appearance in the 1999 book, “Personalized and Database Printing”, that he authored with David Broudy.\n\nThe concept of merging static document elements and variable document elements predates the term and has seen various implementations ranging from simple desktop 'mail merge', to complex mainframe applications in the financial and banking industry. In the past, the term VDP has been most closely associated with digital printing machines. However, in recent years the application of this technology has spread to web pages, emails, and mobile messaging.\n"}

Several types of pancreatectomy exist, including pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure), distal pancreatectomy, segmental pancreatectomy, and total pancreatectomy. In recent years, the TP-IAT (Total Pancreatectomy with Islet Autotransplantation) has also gained respectable traction within the medical community. These procedures are used in the management of several conditions involving the pancreas, such as benign pancreatic tumors, pancreatic cancer, and pancreatitis.\n\nIt is performed for a variety of reasons, including:\n\nThe most common surgical procedure involving removal of a portion of the pancreas is called a pancreaticoduodenectomy.\nAmong common consequences of complete or nearly complete pancreatectomy are deficiencies of pancreatic endocrine or exocrine function requiring replacement of insulin or digestive enzymes. The patient immediately develops type 1 diabetes, with little hope for future type 1 diabetes treatments involving the restoration of endocrine function to a damaged pancreas, since the pancreas is either partially or completely absent. Type 1 diabetes can be treated with careful blood glucose monitoring and insulin therapy. Because the pancreas is responsible for the production of many digestive enzymes, a pancreatectomy should only be given as an option for pancreatic disease which is life-threatening, such as pancreatic cancers. It is very important to note that even after a pancreatectomy, pain still exists in most patients. \n\nA distal pancreatectomy is removal of the body and tail of the pancreas.\n\nAfter a total pancreatectomy, the body no longer produces its own insulin or pancreatic enzymes, so patients have to take insulin and enzyme supplements. Those who were not already diabetic become so. Glycemic control is challenging even for relatively young and healthy apancreatic people, owing to the digestive challenges of not having endogenous insulin and pancreatic enzymes under autonomic control. It can be insurmountably challenging depending on age and comorbidities. But overall, quality of life in patients after total pancreatectomy is comparable with quality of life in patients who undergo a partial pancreatic resection.\n\nAn experimental procedure called islet cell transplantation exists to help mediate the loss of endocrine function following total pancreatectomy.\n\n\n"}

The village is south east of the centre of Cambridge beyond the A11 road and also within comfortable driving distance of Newmarket and Haverhill where many residents work and shop.\n\nAt the 2011 census, Balsham parish had a population of 1,591.\n\nIn 1015, Balsham was totally destroyed by Viking raiders. A sign on the village green commemorates the sole survivor of the attack who escaped by hiding in the parish church. It was the birthplace of scholastic philosopher Adam of Balsham.\n\nIn 1568 Richard Killingworth, Esq., was granted an estate at Balsham, which in 1590 belonged to his son and heir John Killingworth and was called Place Manor, much later becoming Place Farm. In 1617, the year of John's death, he still held the manor on the site of what in 1975 was called Balsham Place, together with freehold and copyhold lands, an enclosure in Balsham Wood, and heathland in the west part of the parish. His eldest son Giles (born 1571) thereafter held the manor of the Charterhouse Foundation, the feudal superior. A Mr. Killingworth still held the estate in 1715 when it appeared to extend to 261 acres, but in 1756 it was for sale.\n\nThe area between Balsham and West Wratting is said to be the haunt of the mythical Shug Monkey.\n\nThe current church has a mix of dates, with the bell tower being the oldest part, dating from the 13th century. It was possibly built by Hugh de Balsham, who was Bishop of Ely between 1257 and 1286. The chancel dates from the early 14th century, whilst the nave with its clerestory dates from the late 14th – the 26 stalls with their misericords were added during this building phase and probably date from 1400. A rood loft was added in the latter half of the 15th century, and the chancel roof was raised with its clerestory being added at the same time.\n\nAt some (unrecorded) time between the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the end of The Commonwealth, 17 of the misericords were removed, leaving nine. In the 19th century one misericord, which may have been the work of Canon H.J.S. Burrell, a former rector who was a noted woodcarver, was added.\n\nThe 19th century saw some extensive renovation, with the roofs being renewed, and the clerestories being repaired. A vestry was added on the north side in 1867, and further restoration was carried out in 1875. Further works have been carried out in the 20th century, with the addition of a chapel in the north aisle, containing an Elizabethan altar table. In 1973 the bell tower was strengthened.\n\nThere are some pictures and a description of the church at the Cambridgeshire Churches website. The church has a number of 15th-century memorial brasses: two are for former Rectors, John Sleford (d. 1401) and John Blodwell (d. 1462), and the third for an unidentified Knight (c.1480s). None is now in its original position.\n\nThe village was at one time noted for its large community of Familists.\n\nBalsham is part of the South East Cambridgeshire for UK general elections. A safe seat for the Conservative party, the seat is currently held by Lucy Frazer, following the retirement of Sir James Paice. At the 2015 general election, the Conservatives won 48.5% of the vote in the constituency, leaving the Liberal Democrats and Labour a distant second and third respectively.\n\nBalsham is in the Linton Electoral Division for County Council elections. At the 2013 County Council Elections the Conservatives won 1,253 votes winning by a majority of 1 from the Liberal Democrats (1,252 votes). The United Kingdom Independence Party (346 votes) were third and Labour (269 votes) fourth.\n\nBalsham is in the South Cambridgeshire local government district. The village is part of a ward that also comprises Carlton, Castle Camps, Horseheath, Shudy Camps, West Wickham, West Wratting and Weston Colville. As at the 2013 local elections, the two seats on the district council were held by the Conservatives.\n\nBalsham is a large parish covering . It is located at in south east Cambridgeshire, near the county boundaries with Essex and Suffolk. The town is south east of the city of Cambridge. The larger village of Linton is to the west, and smaller villages of West Wickham and West Wratting lie to the south and east.\n\nThe village is sited on a ridge which runs from east to west, reaching at its eastern edge. From the village, the ground falls away to open countryside.\n\nBalsham has a post office/general store and a Coffee Shop (which was, until recently, a butcher's shop, hence the name \"The Old Butchers\"). The village also has two public houses – The Black Bull and The Bell.\n\"Prince's Memorial\" is a full-sized bandstand opposite the village green.\n\nThe Icknield Way Path passes through the village on its 110-mile journey from Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire to Knettishall Heath in Suffolk. The Icknield Way Trail, a multi-user route for walkers, horse riders and off-road cyclists also passes through the village. A stone marking the route of the Icknield Way is located on the village green.\n\nThere is a very limited local bus service running through the village operated by Stagecoach that terminates in Cambridge. Buses run approximately every two hours between Haverhill and Cambridge. \nThe A11 road runs within of Balsham, providing easy links to Stansted Airport and London . \nThe nearest railway stations to Balsham are and on the West Anglia Main Line to , and which connects several lines including the Hitchin-Cambridge Line to .\nBalsham is served by two airports: Cambridge Airport and London Stansted which is about 20 miles away.\n\nBalsham was served briefly by train in the 1840s by on the Newmarket and Chesterford Railway, one of the earliest railway closures in history when the line was diverted to Cambridge.\n\nThe Meadow Community Primary School on the High Street provides for primary school children aged from 4 to 11. The school had 234 pupils in 2016. Children from the surrounding villages West Wratting, West Wickham, and Weston Colville also attend the school, travelling there by bus. Children of secondary school age travel to nearby Linton Village College.\n\nThe Church Institute used to host a number of groups and societies. However, in recent years, the Women's Institute and local pantomime groups are more likely to meet at the school. The Holy Trinity Church holds two services every Sunday and communion every Wednesday. The church also plays host to two yearly concerts by the village choir, the \"Balsham Singers\". The village has a large recreation ground and bowling green used by football, cricket, and bowls teams.\n\nBalsham is covered by several local newspapers. The \"Cambridge Evening News\" is published each afternoon and occasionally contains news about the village, while the \"Haverhill Echo\" appears every Thursday and offers more comprehensive coverage. The \"Saffron Walden Reporter\" is a free newspaper delivered weekly to every residence in the village, and is the main source of local property listings. \"Balsham Review\" is a monthly parish magazine with local news, sporting reports, and advertisements. Local radio stations include \"BBC Radio Cambridgeshire\" and \"Heart Cambridge\".\n\n\n"}

A small town, Middle Bass, lies on the island. The 805-acre (3.258 km²) island is shaped like the Big Dipper and is one of three Bass Islands located at the center of a group of 23 smaller islands. It is located in Put-in-Bay Township, Ottawa County, Ohio.\n\nSome of its more famous neighbors are South Bass Island, with the town of Put-in-Bay, Kelleys Island, and Pelee Island.\n\nThe island was landed upon by French explorer, Robert La Salle, in 1679. The abundance of wildflowers on the island impressed La Salle and his crew so much that they appropriately named it \"Isle des Fleures\", the Island of Flowers. It would retain this name for the next 200 years until it was acquired by a German count in 1856. With the aid of immigrant German workers, the island was used for grape cultivation. This proved to be a very successful undertaking. Old aerial photos of the island (and its neighbor, North Bass Island) show the majority of the island covered with neat rows of grapevines.\n\nBy 1875, Middle Bass Island's Golden Eagle Winery was reputed to be the largest wine producer in the United States. The Lonz family acquired the business in 1884 and owned and operated it until the death of George Lonz in 1968. Lonz Winery has often been compared with the wineries of the German Rhineland. The old castle-like structure has been visited by countless dignitaries including five American Presidents. The winery is now part of a corporation bearing the Lonz name. Since 1979, the wines have been made by Italian enologist Claudio Salvador.\n\nOn July 1, 2000 tragedy struck the Lonz Winery when a terrace collapsed leaving one dead and dozens injured.\n\nLonz Winery was purchased by the state of Ohio and Middle Bass Island State Park established in 2001.\n\nLonz Winery has been renovated by the state of Ohio, and was reopened to the public on June 22, 2017. They are not producing or selling wine on site, but it is open for tours.\n\nMiddle Bass is serviced by the Miller Boat Line from Catawba Island and the Middle Bass Ferry Line from Put-In-Bay. It is common to use Middle Bass as a lower cost/less crowded base and then take the \"Sonny S\" (sole ship of the Middle Bass Ferry Line) to Put-In-Bay for the day.\n\nMiddle Bass Island Airport has a 1852-foot runway with commercial air-taxi service. Middle Bass-East Point Airport offers a 2,085-foot turf runway.\n\n"}

He currently manages Campeonato Brasileiro Série A side Fortaleza.\n\nMost of his vast professional career, which had spanned 25 years and 1,257 professional club matches, was associated with São Paulo, with which he won 20 major titles, including three Brazilian Leagues, two Copa Libertadores and the 2005 FIFA Club World Cup. He also scored 131 goals during his career, with most of them coming from free kicks and penalties and one coming from open play. \nHe is recognised by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics as the goalkeeper to have scored the most goals in the history of football.\n\nCeni also represented Brazil 16 times over the course of his career, being part of the squads that won the 2002 FIFA World Cup and the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup, and also taking part at the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Ceni is considered one of the all-time greatest Brazilian goalkeepers.\n\nRogério Mücke Ceni was born 22 January 1973 in Pato Branco, Paraná. Ceni is of Italian and German descent. He holds Italian citizenship.\n\nCeni made his senior debuts with Sinop Futebol Clube. In 1990, the 17-year-old joined São Paulo FC, spending his first six seasons in Série A as a backup or third-choice.\n\nOn 25 June 1993 Ceni made his first team debut, starting in a 4–1 win against CD Tenerife for the Trofeo Ciudad de Santiago de Compostela friendly championship. In the following year he was utilized as a starter in the year's Copa CONMEBOL, appearing in all matches as his side was crowned champions.\n\nIn the 1997 season, after legendary Zetti moved to Santos FC, Ceni was chosen as his replacement. On 14 July 2005, Ceni was São Paulo's captain as the team won the 2005 Copa Libertadores, a third for the club. Two weeks later, in a match against Clube Atlético Mineiro, he broke the record for most appearances for the team, with 618 matches – he wore a special commemorative jersey that had the number \"618\" printed on the back; on 25 July of the following year, he scored a penalty against Mexican side C.D. Guadalajara (also a match-winner), becoming the \"Tricolor\"'s all-time leading scorer in the Libertadores.\n\nFrom 2005–07, he scored an astonishing 47 goals in all competitions combined, as the club won two national championships and the 2005 FIFA Club World Cup; in the latter competition, he netted in the semifinals against Ittihad FC (3–2, through a penalty kick), and was voted \"Man of the match\" in the final against Liverpool, as well as the tournament's MVP.\n\nOn 20 August 2006, Ceni scored his 63rd and record-breaking goal by netting a free kick against Cruzeiro Esporte Clube in the domestic league, a few minutes after denying a penalty to the opposition. Later in the same match, he scored a goal from the spot and took his total to 64, also tying the match 2–2; this put him two goals ahead of the previous holder, Paraguayan José Luis Chilavert.\n\nOn 29 October 2006, Ceni made his 700th official appearance for São Paulo, against Figueirense FC in a 2–0 victory. Some of the gloss was taken off the occasion when the player was ordered to change his bright yellow jersey because it matched with the referee's; at the end of the 2007 season, which ended in league conquest, he was voted by the Brazilian Football Confederation as the Best Player.\n\nIn April 2009, Ceni fractured his ankle in training, being initially sidelined for six months, but recovering sooner than expected. On 28 October 2010, against Clube Atlético Paranaense, he played his 700th game as club captain. The following year, on 27 March, he scored from a free kick to win the match against arch rivals Corinthians Paulista, shooting from 18 metres for his 100th goal.\n\nOn 7 September 2011, Ceni made his 1000th appearance for São Paulo. In late January of the following year, the 39-year-old underwent an operation on his shoulder, losing six months of competition.\n\nOn 1 August 2012, Ceni returned to the field, scoring from a direct free kick in a 2–0 Copa Sudamericana away win against Esporte Clube Bahia; his side went on to win that year's tournament. He subsequently scored three goals in the league, ending the campaign as a starter.\n\nDespite already aged 40, Ceni stated that his spirit for competition was the same as an eighteen-year-old's, but still stating that his recovery is harder than years ago. On 14 July 2013, Ceni scored his 111th goal from a free kick in a 2–3 loss at Esporte Clube Vitória.\n\nOn 7 December 2013, after lengthy negotiations, Ceni renewed his contract with \"Tricolor\" for a further season. On 20 April 2014, in a 3–0 home win against Botafogo, he had three records recognized by Guinness World Records: most goals scored by a goalkeeper, number of games played for the same club and number of times as captain.\n\nOn 27 October 2014, Ceni broke Ryan Giggs' record for most wins at a single club after playing in São Paulo's 3–0 win over Goiás. He finished the campaign with eight league goals (his best goal scoring record within seven years), being an undisputed starter.\n\nOn 28 November 2014, Ceni signed a new deal with São Paulo, until August 2015, despite previously stating that he would retire at the end of the season. On 29 March 2015, after scoring in a 3–0 home win against Linense, he surpassed Marcelinho Carioca in the number of goals scored by direct free kicks for only one club, with Ceni having 60 and Marcelinho, 59.\n\nIn June 2015, Ceni scored his 128th goal, entering in the club's top 10 goalscorers list. Ceni announced his retirement from professional football on 6 December 2015.\n\nA Brazilian international for nine years, Ceni collected 16 caps. He was selected to the squads that won the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2002 FIFA World Cup (and the 2006 World Cup, still not fully recovered from knee surgery), but only appeared in two games in final stages, the 3–2 win against Mexico in the first tournament and the 4–1 triumph over Japan in the third.\n\nIn December 2016, Ceni was appointed as São Paulo coach, with Englishman Michael Beale and Frenchman Charles Hembert joining as his assistants. On 3 July 2017, after poor results - São Paulo were eliminated in State League, Brazilian Cup and 2017 Copa Sudamericana into a period of one month and are in relegation zone in Brazilian League, he was sacked.\n\nCeni signed with Fortaleza to coach the team in 2018. On 3 November of that year, Fortaleza clinched promotion to the Série A, and seven days later, the club clinched the Série B title for the first time in its history. In 2019, Fortaleza also won the Campeonato Cearense and the Copa do Nordeste.\n\nOn 11 August 2019, Ceni was named Cruzeiro manager, but was dismissed on 26 September, after having altercations with the club's main players, specifically Thiago Neves and Dedé. Three days later, he was announced at his former side Fortaleza, replacing fired Zé Ricardo.\n\nA dead-ball specialist, Ceni was the official taker of free kicks and penalties for São Paulo from 1997 until his retirement, a time period in which he scored 131 goals. In addition to his accurate set-pieces, prolific goalscoring, distribution, and ability with the ball at his feet, he was also known as an excellent goalkeeper and shot-stopper, and stood out for his determination and longevity throughout his career, as he retired with over 40 years of age. Ceni was known for being capable of producing brilliant saves, such as those in the final of the 2005 FIFA Club World Championship, which saw São Paulo defeat Liverpool 1–0; for his performances, Ceni later won the Golden Ball, which is awarded to the competition's best player. He is considered to be one of Brazil's greatest goalkeepers ever.\n\nCeni is different from several footballers: he prefers rock instead of pagode, a Brazilian musical style, common among football players, and has a more classical style of dressing. According to Ceni: \"I like to dress in a good way. I like to kick free kicks. I do not do to make myself. I feel well.\"\n\n Includes matches and goals in Copa Libertadores, Copa Sudamericana, Recopa Sudamericana, Copa Mercosur, Gold Cup, FIFA Club World Cup.\n\nSinop\n\nSão Paulo\n\nBrazil\n\nIndividual\n\nSão Paulo\n\nFortaleza\n\nIndividual\n\n\n"}

To execute a Split S, the pilot half-rolls their aircraft inverted and executes a descending half-loop, resulting in level flight in the opposite direction at a lower altitude.\n\nThe Split S is taught to be used in dogfighting when the pilot has the opportunity to withdraw from battle. It can be an effective tactic to prevent an enemy behind (between eight o'clock and four o'clock positions) from gaining a missile lock-on while one is disengaging from a fight.\n\nThe Split S is contrasted with the Immelmann turn, which is an ascending half-loop that finishes with a half-roll out, resulting in level flight in the opposite direction at a higher altitude. The Split S is also called a reversed Immelmann turn and can also be written with a hyphen: Split-S. In basic terms, the Immelmann and Split S are very similar, both accomplishing the same reversal in course, but the Split S exchanges altitude to gain speed, while the Immelmann turn exchanges speed to gain altitude.\nThe Split S, being a descending maneuver, means that the pilot must ensure that it is started high enough to complete the half-loop; the exact minimum altitude depends on factors like the aircraft's speed, weight and maneuverability, likewise the terrain below the plane. Misjudgements can arise from a lack of situational awareness or from an error in reading instruments.\n\nThe reasons for starting the Split S maneuver from the inverted position include the fact that people tolerate acceleration (\"g-force\") applied from head to feet several times better than the reverse direction, as much as 9g versus 3g. Most combat aircraft frames are also designed to pull more Gs in their positive aspects (upward to the aircraft), rather than negative (downward to the aircraft). A much tighter maneuver is therefore possible with the half roll.\n\nThe Split S without a beginning half-roll was a standard maneuver in early World War II by German pilots seeking to evade British fighters. The Merlin engine used in British fighters was carburetted, and the float valves would malfunction under negative g-force leading to reduced power or a stalled engine (The German fighters were not subject to this problem since they used fuel injection). This could be prevented by quarter-rolling the aircraft before starting the dive, but doing so took up enough time to give the German pilots an excellent chance of escaping. The beginnings of a solution was provided by \"Miss Shilling's orifice\", a fuel-flow restriction device, and was finally solved by changing from the original S.U. carburettors to Bendix-Stromberg pressure carburettors, and later to S.U. injection carburettors.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1949487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949487", "title": "Dependent type", "text": "Dependent type\n\nIn computer science and logic, a dependent type is a type whose definition depends on a value. It is an overlapping feature of type theory and type systems. In intuitionistic type theory, dependent types are used to encode logic's quantifiers like \"for all\" and \"there exists\". In functional programming languages like Agda, ATS, Coq, F*, Epigram, and Idris, dependent types may help reduce bugs by enabling the programmer to assign types that further restrain the set of possible implementations.\n\nTwo common examples of dependent types are dependent functions and dependent pairs. The return type of a dependent function may depend on the \"value\" (not just type) of one of its arguments. For instance, a function that takes a positive integer formula_1 may return an array of length formula_1, where the array length is part of the type of the array. (Note that this is different from polymorphism and generic programming, both of which include the type as an argument.) A dependent pair may have a second value of which the type depends on the first value. Sticking with the array example, a dependent pair may be used to pair an array with its length in a type-safe way.\n\nDependent types add complexity to a type system. Deciding the equality of dependent types in a program may require computations. If arbitrary values are allowed in dependent types, then deciding type equality may involve deciding whether two arbitrary programs produce the same result; hence type checking may become undecidable.\n\nDependent types were created to deepen the connection between programming and logic.\n\nIn 1934, Haskell Curry noticed that the types used in typed lambda calculus, and in its combinatory logic counterpart, followed the same pattern as axioms in propositional logic. Going further, for every proof in the logic, there was a matching function (term) in the programming language. One of Curry's examples was the correspondence between simply typed lambda calculus and intuitionistic logic.\n\nPredicate logic is an extension of propositional logic, adding quantifiers. Howard and de Bruijn extended lambda calculus to match this more powerful logic by creating types for dependent functions, which correspond to \"for all\", and dependent pairs, which correspond to \"there exists\".\n\nLoosely speaking, dependent types are similar to the type of an indexed family of sets. More formally, given a type formula_4 in a universe of types formula_5, one may have a family of types formula_6, which assigns to each term formula_7 a type formula_8. We say that the type \"B(a)\" varies with \"a\".\n\nA function whose type of return value varies with its argument (i.e. there is no fixed codomain) is a dependent function and the type of this function is called dependent product type, pi-type or dependent function type. For this example, the dependent function type is typically written as formula_9 or formula_10\n\nIf formula_6 is a constant function, the corresponding dependent product type is equivalent to an ordinary function type. That is, formula_12 is judgmentally equal to formula_13 when \"B\" does not depend on \"x\".\n\nThe name 'pi-type' comes from the idea that these may be viewed as a Cartesian product of types. Pi-types can also be understood as models of universal quantifiers.\n\nFor example, if we write formula_14 for \"n\"-tuples of real numbers, then formula_15 would be the type of a function which, given a natural number \"n\", returns a tuple of real numbers of size \"n\". The usual function space arises as a special case when the range type does not actually depend on the input. E.g. formula_16 is the type of functions from natural numbers to the real numbers, which is written as formula_17 in typed lambda calculus.\n\nThe dual of the dependent product type is the dependent pair type, dependent sum type, sigma-type, or (confusingly) dependent product type. Sigma-types can also be understood as existential quantifiers. Continuing the above example, if, in the universe of types formula_5, there is a type formula_4 and a family of types formula_6, then there is a dependent pair type formula_22\n\nThe dependent pair type captures the idea of an ordered pair where the type of the second term is dependent on the value of the first. If formula_23 then formula_7 and formula_25. If \"B\" is a constant function, then the dependent pair type becomes (is judgementally equal to) the product type, that is, an ordinary Cartesian product formula_26.\n\nLet formula_4 be some type, and let formula_6. By the Curry–Howard correspondence, \"B\" can be interpreted as a logical predicate on terms of \"A\". For a given formula_7, whether the type \"B(a)\" is inhabited indicates whether \"a\" satisfies this predicate. The correspondence can be extended to existential quantification and dependent pairs: the proposition formula_30 is true if and only if the type formula_31 is inhabited.\n\nFor example, formula_32 is less than or equal to formula_33 if and only if there exists another natural number formula_34 such that \"m\" + \"k\" = \"n\". In logic, this statement is codified by existential quantification: formula_35 This proposition corresponds to the dependent pair type: formula_36 That is, a proof of the statement that \"m\" is less than \"n\" is a pair that contains both a positive number \"k\", which is the difference between \"m\" and \"n\", and a proof of the equality \"m\" + \"k\" = \"n\".\n\nHenk Barendregt developed the lambda cube as a means of classifying type systems along three axes. The eight corners of the resulting cube-shaped diagram each correspond to a type system, with simply typed lambda calculus in the least expressive corner, and calculus of constructions in the most expressive. The three axes of the cube correspond to three different augmentations of the simply typed lambda calculus: the addition of dependent types, the addition of polymorphism, and the addition of higher kinded type constructors (functions from types to types, for example). The lambda cube is generalized further by pure type systems.\n\nThe system formula_37 of pure first order dependent types, corresponding to the logical framework LF, is obtained by generalising the function space type of the simply typed lambda calculus to the dependent product type.\n\nThe system formula_38 of second order dependent types is obtained from formula_37 by allowing quantification over type constructors. In this theory the dependent product operator subsumes both the formula_40 operator of simply typed lambda calculus and the formula_41 binder of System F.\n\nThe higher order system formula_42 extends formula_38 to all four forms of abstraction from the lambda cube: functions from terms to terms, types to types, terms to types and types to terms. The system corresponds to the calculus of constructions whose derivative, the calculus of inductive constructions is the underlying system of the Coq proof assistant.\n\nThe Curry–Howard correspondence implies that types can be constructed that express arbitrarily complex mathematical properties. If the user can supply a constructive proof that a type is \"inhabited\" (i.e., that a value of that type exists) then a compiler can check the proof and convert it into executable computer code that computes the value by carrying out the construction. The proof checking feature makes dependently typed languages closely related to proof assistants. The code-generation aspect provides a powerful approach to formal program verification and proof-carrying code, since the code is derived directly from a mechanically verified mathematical proof.\n\n\n\n"}

The piston or other reciprocating part is directly coupled to a sliding yoke with a slot that engages a pin on the rotating part. The location of the piston versus time is simple harmonic motion, i.e., a sine wave having constant amplitude and constant frequency, given a constant rotational speed.\n\nThis setup is most commonly used in control valve actuators in high-pressure oil and gas pipelines.\n\nAlthough not a common metalworking machine nowadays, crude shapers can use Scotch yokes. Almost all those use a Whitworth linkage, which gives a slow speed forward cutting stroke and a faster return.\n\nIt has been used in various internal combustion engines, such as the Bourke engine, SyTech engine, and many hot air engines and steam engines.\n\nThe term \"scotch yoke\" continues to be used when the slot in the yoke is shorter than the diameter of the circle made by the crank pin. For example, the side rods of a locomotive may have scotch yokes to permit vertical motion of intermediate driving axles.\n\nWhat is essentially a Scotch yoke, is used in the Tide-Predicting Machine No. 2 to generate a sinusoidal motion(Sine functions).\n\nUnder ideal engineering conditions, force is applied directly in the line of travel of the assembly. The sinusoidal motion, cosinusoidal velocity, and sinusoidal acceleration (assuming constant angular velocity) result in smoother operation. The higher percentage of time spent at top dead centre (dwell) improves theoretical engine efficiency of constant volume combustion cycles. It allows the elimination of joints typically served by a wrist pin, and near elimination of piston skirts and cylinder scuffing, as side loading of piston due to sine of connecting rod angle is mitigated. The longer the distance between the piston and the yoke, the less wear that occurs, but greater the inertia, making such increases in the piston rod length realistically only suitable for lower RPM (but higher torque) applications.\n\nThe Scotch yoke is not used in most internal combustion engines because of the rapid wear of the slot in the yoke caused by sliding friction and high contact pressures. This is mitigated by a sliding block between the crank and the slot in the piston rod. Also, increased heat loss during combustion due to extended dwell at top dead centre offsets any constant volume combustion improvements in real engines. In an engine application, less percent of the time is spent at bottom dead centre when compared to a conventional piston and crankshaft mechanism, which reduces blowdown time for two-stroke engines. Experiments have shown that extended dwell time does not work well with constant volume combustion Otto cycle engines. Gains might be more apparent in Otto cycle engines using a stratified direct injection (diesel or similar) cycle to reduce heat losses.\n\nAn improved Scotch yoke, with a means of absorbing sideways thrust, was patented in 1978 by William L. Carlson, Jr., US patent 4075898.\n\n"}

It was published in English in 2003 by Canongate, in a translation by John King.\n\nIt is a first-person account of a travelling drug salesman. He goes to different places around the world, peddling a memory erasing drug. Various minor characters act as outlets for the authors musings on memory. Told through a mental haze of pretty much every drug ever invented and smattered with promiscuous sexual encounters of all varieties, the protagonist eventually begins sampling his own product. Pages of deja vu and disjointed thought lead him to meet with the inventor of the drug in Arizona. The author is an epileptic and took his seizures and temporary memory loss as part of his inspiration for the book. \n\nThe memory loss also gives him an interesting transitional device for forwarding the plot without having to get caught up in details he wishes to omit.\n\nThe author was trying to provoke the question to the reader, \"What does it mean to be human?\". There are definitely religious ideas here, and it is important to note that Loriga was raised Catholic. Memory is linked to sin, both original and individual. Almost reminiscent of Dr. Heidegger's Experiment by Nathaniel Hawthorne, each character is to some extent doomed to make the same mistakes they did before. Therefore, one could draw the conclusion that our sins are a part of us, inseparable and thus uncontrollable.\n\nThe novel can be described as very European because it reflects the pain of the Second World War and its extension into the future. The author once said in an interview that, \"...we Europeans are so divided amongst ourselves, but we have so much in common -- a common history and a heavy past that we carry, and at some point you feel we look back more than we look forwards. Whereas in America it's the other way around. It doesn't mean whatever they're saying or whatever they're seeing is better than what we're doing. It's not a good thing in itself. But it's true: Americans are more like little kids in a way, they predict themselves in the future. We're the old people now.\"\nThis is clearly shown towards the end of the book when the inventor, K.L. Krumper, talks about being injured and in a hospital, watching reconstruction work and thinking. \"Now seeing absolutely clearly the feeling of peace sweeping through those labourers as they finished their job, I decided to place all my faith in the demolition of the past...You have to remember that in those days I was just one more of the millions of soldiers surviving from a vanquished army. Belonging to a dead Germany, defeated by shame...We came back to Germany in the slow trains defeated, like strangers ejected from paradise by strangers. The destruction of the past then seemed to me to be the only possible hope.\"\n\nAt the same time then, the book jumps to the opposite position and reflects a Nietzschean concept found throughout the writings of modern authors like Chuck Palahniuk. The idea being that you have to break societies (or people) down before they can become something better.\n"}

{"id": "1949510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949510", "title": "Ninety Pound Wuss", "text": "Ninety Pound Wuss\n\nNinety Pound Wuss (sometimes styled as 90 Lb. Wuss) was an American punk rock band formed in Port Angeles, Washington in 1994. They signed to Tooth & Nail Records in 1995 and released three studio albums over the next five years which would be supported by several national tours.\n\nIn the mid-1990s Ninety Pound Wuss established itself as part of the Christian punk scene with their self-titled debut. The release of their second album, \"Where Meager Die Of Self Interest\" (1997) saw the band's sound take a dramatic shift, becoming much darker and more dynamically complex. Ninety Pound Wuss continued this development further on their post-punk swan song, \"Short Hand Operation\" (1999), by not only displaying an increased use of guitar effects and synthesizers, but also by showcasing some of the strongest songwriting of their career. However, the juxtaposition of being a punk band associated with the Christian music industry proved too exhausting and would ultimately lead to their disbandment in 2000.\n\nNinety Pound Wuss was formed by drummer Marty Martinez, guitarist John Himmelberger and bassist Matt \"Gunner\" Nelson in Port Angeles, Washington in 1994. Lead vocalist Jeff Suffering joined the band shortly thereafter, and was the only original member left in the band when they disbanded in 1999. After signing with Tooth & Nail Records, Matt \"Gunner\" Nelson departed and was replaced with bassist Jiles O'Neal, who was also a member of the MxPx side project The cooties. Ninety Pound Wuss released their self-titled debut album in 1995, recorded at Robert Lang Studios in Seattle, Washington with producer Bob Moon. The sessions featured drum tech Yuri Ruley, better known as the drummer of MxPx, who the band toured with and opened shows for. Upon release, \"Ninety Pound Wuss\" established the group as part of the Christian punk community with a relatively straightforward punk rock sound that included elements of both hardcore punk and pop punk. This combination of styles can be heard on \"Something Must Break\", the album's best known song due to compilation appearances and a music video. Lyrically, the album expressed their Christian faith in a somewhat one-dimensional way as compared to later releases, frequently mentioning Christ or Jesus. In 1996, Ninety Pound Wuss issued the \"Kick You Hard\" EP which included the newly recorded track \"Heresy\", as well as borrowing \"Misplaced Society\" from their debut.\n\nNinety Pound Wuss returned to Robert Lang Studios to record their follow-up, \"Where Meager Die Of Self Interest\", with producer Tim Mac who had previously worked with Babes in Toyland, Today Is the Day and Unsane. The album's writing and recording process would take place during a transitional period, with the band undergoing several line-up changes. Dale Yob (The Cootees, Slick Shoes) replaced bassist Matt Nelson prior to recording, while John Spalding took over for guitarist John Himmelberger midway through the sessions. Due to these changes, Suffering began to take a more active role in the band's songwriting. \"Where Meager Die of Self Interest\" saw release on October 28, 1997 and differed drastically from their debut, with the music taking on a much darker post-punk dynamic that also introduced the incorporation of Suffering's keyboard work. In addition to these changes, the vocals would become more frantic and inaudible, yet the lyrics still maintained their beliefs with a newfound sense of maturity, as made evident on tracks like \"Queen Maggot\" and \"Sick and You're Wrong\". Along with continued touring in 1998, Ninety Pound Wuss contributed the non-album track \"In Silence\" to \"Home Alive Benefit Series: Vol. 3\", a split EP with The Captives that included an informative zine outlining the Home Alive anti-violence organization.\n\nPrior to their next album, Ninety Pound Wuss would undergo another member change with Matt Johnson (Blenderhead, Roadside Monument) replacing bassist Dale Yob. Shortly after, the band entered Seattle based Avast! Recording Company with producer Steve Kravac, known for his work with Blink-182, Less Than Jake, MxPx and Youth Brigade. The outcome would be their third effort, \"Short Hand Operation\", released on April 22, 1999. The album marked another drastic shift in the band's music by building on the post-hardcore experimentalism and vivid lyrical imagery of their previous offering, with a noticeable increase in both the keyboard playing of Suffering and the guitar effects of Spalding. These factors helped to further evolve the band's post-punk sound, creating the most dynamic album of their career with songs ranging from the chaotic onslaught of \"Torment in Tension\" and \"What I Am\" to widely atmospheric tracks like the synth-laden \"It Seems So Far Away\" and epic album closer \"At the End of It All\". Satisfied with the final outcome, Suffering referred to \"Short Hand Operation\" as \"quite possibly ...the best [album] I'll ever record.\" To support the release, Ninety Pound Wuss embarked on another United States tour.\n\nThroughout their existence, the group had been active in both the Christian and general-market music scenes; however, their growing displeasure of being associated with the Christian music industry began to take its toll on the band. Suffering was uncomfortable with being part of a marketplace that exploited God and religious beliefs for the sake of personal and financial gain. Ninety Pound Wuss tried to reject its association with the industry, which proved unsuccessful in part because Tooth & Nail Records, a predominantly Christian punk label, were contractually owed another album by the band. These circumstances lead to the band's breakup in 2000, with Suffering putting simply, \"We had a rough tour and nobody wanted to continue playing in the Christian music industry.\"\n\nNinety Pound Wuss issued the posthumous live album \"Hierarchy of Snakes\" in 2000. The album, which was likely released to fulfill their contractual obligations with Tooth & Nail Records, included many songs from \"Short Hand Operation\" and \"Where Meager Die of Self Interest\". It also featured the Bauhaus cover \"Double Dare\", as well as the unreleased track \"Dead End\". Unlike their studio albums which would see release on multiple formats, \"Hierarchy of Snakes\" was only available as a limited edition CD.\n\nMembers of Ninety Pound Wuss began branching out into other projects towards the final stages of the band and after its breakup. Jeff Suffering and John Spalding formed Raft of Dead Monkeys, who released their debut album \"Thoroughlev\" on Burnout Records in 2001. That same year, Suffering organized the group Suffering and the Hideous Thieves, going on to issue several full-length albums, in addition to split releases with Rocky Votolato, The Hush Hush and Discover America. Matt Johnson joined The Out Circuit, a project fronted by Nathan Burke (formerly of Frodus) who, like Suffering and the Hideous Thieves, released multiple albums through Lujo Records.\n\nAlthough Spalding was diagnosed with cancer sometime in 2004, he continued on with a home recording project that came to be known as Loveland, performing the majority of the music himself. Members of Minus the Bear, The Blood Brothers, These Arms Are Snakes and Pretty Girls Make Graves would also contribute to these recordings. After a grueling four-year battle against cancer, Spalding died on November 23, 2008. The Loveland album, \"The Beautiful Truth\", would be released posthumously on Tigre Blanco Records in 2009. Inspired by his music and friendship, Suffering created a blog shortly after Spalding's passing in an attempt to document his own life, which includes his current ministry at Mars Hill Church in Seattle, where he and Johnson attend and serve as pastors.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is the younger brother of Emperor Naruhito and the younger son of Emperor Emeritus Akihito and Empress Emerita Michiko. He is the heir presumptive to the Chrysanthemum Throne. Since his marriage in June 1990, he has had the title and has headed his own branch of the imperial family.\n\nThe prince was born on 30 November 1965 in the morning at 12:22 am in the Imperial Household Agency Hospital, Tokyo Imperial Palace in Tokyo. His given name is Fumihito. His mother, Empress Emerita Michiko, is a convert to Shinto from Roman Catholicism. His childhood appellation was Prince Aya (礼宮 Aya-no-miya). He attended the primary and secondary schools of the Gakushūin. He played tennis in primary and secondary schools of the Gakushūin.\n\nIn April 1984, he entered the Law Department of Gakushuin University, where he studied law and biological science. After graduating from the university with a Bachelor's degree in Political Science, he studied the taxonomy of fish at St John's College, Oxford in the United Kingdom from October 1988 to June 1990.\n\nUpon the death of his grandfather, Emperor Shōwa (Hirohito), on 7 January 1989, he became second-in-line to the throne after his elder brother, Crown Prince Naruhito.\n\nPrince Fumihito received a PhD degree in ornithology from the Graduate University for Advanced Studies in October 1996. His doctoral dissertation was titled, \"Molecular Phylogeny of Jungle Fowls, genus Gallus and Monophyletic Origin of Domestic Fowls\". He conducted field research in Indonesia in 1993 and 1994, and in Yunnan Province in the People's Republic of China. When the Emperor Emeritus was then Crown Prince, he introduced tilapia to Thailand as an important source of protein. Tilapia can be easily cultured and Prince Fumihito, who is also known as \"catfish specialist,\" has managed to maintain and expand the aquacultural studies with the people of Thailand.\n\nPrior to Fumihito's birth, the announcement about the then-Crown Prince Akihito's engagement and marriage to the then-Ms. Michiko Shōda had drawn opposition from traditionalist groups, because Shōda came from a Roman Catholic family. Although Shōda was never baptized, she was educated in Catholic schools and seemed to share the faith of her parents. Rumors also speculated that Empress Kōjun had opposed the engagement. After the death of Fumihito's paternal grandmother Empress Kōjun in 2000, Reuters reported that she was one of the strongest opponents of her son's marriage, and that in the 1960s, she had driven her daughter-in-law and grandchildren to depression by persistently accusing her of not being suitable for her son.\n\nOn 29 June 1990, Prince Fumihito married Kiko Kawashima, the daughter of Tatsuhiko Kawashima (professor of economics at Gakushuin University) and his wife, Kazuyo.\n\nThe couple met when they were both undergraduates at Gakushuin University. Like his father, the present Emperor Emeritus, the Prince married outside the former aristocracy and former collateral branches of the imperial family. Upon marriage, he received the title Prince Akishino (Akishino-no-miya – strictly \"Prince Akishino\") and authorization from the Imperial Household Economy Council to form a new branch of the Imperial Family. The marriage was bitterly resented by officials at the Imperial Household Agency, as well as Prince Akishino's paternal-grandmother Empress Dowager Nagako.\n\nPrince and Princess Akishino have two daughters and one son:\n\nPrince Akishino serves as the president of the Yamashina Institute for Ornithology and the Japanese Association of Zoological Gardens and Aquariums. He is also the honorary president of the World Wide Fund for Nature Japan, the Japan Tennis Association, and the Japan-Netherlands Association.\n\nThe Prince and Princess have made numerous official visits to foreign countries. In June 2002, they became the first members of the Imperial Family to visit Mongolia, in celebration of the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations. In October 2002, they visited the Netherlands to attend the funeral of Prince Claus of the Netherlands. In September 2003, the Prince and Princess made goodwill visits to Fiji, Tonga and Samoa, again, the first time ever members of the Imperial Family had visited these countries. In March 2004, the Prince and Princess returned to the Netherlands for the funeral of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands. In January 2005, they visited Luxembourg to attend the funeral of Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte. From October to November 2006, they visited Paraguay to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Japanese emigration to that country. In January 2008, they visited Indonesia for a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Republic of Indonesia.\n\nThey visited Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania in May 2009 on the occasion of \"Japan-Danube Friendship Year 2009\" and the Netherlands in August 2009 for the commemorative event of the 400th anniversary of the trade relations between Japan and the Netherlands. They have also visited Costa Rica, Uganda, Croatia, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Peru, and Argentina.\n\nIn addition, Prince Akishino carried out public duties on behalf of the Emperor when he was hospitalized. He and other members of the imperial family visited the affected areas after the Great East Japan earthquake in March 2011. From June to July 2014, Prince Fumihito and Princess Kiko visited Republic of Zambia and United Republic of Tanzania.\n\nIn accordance with legislation passed allowing his father's abdication, he became heir presumptive to the throne on 30 April 2019. In June–July 2019, the Crown Prince and his wife carried out the first official overseas visit by the imperial family following the accession of Emperor Naruhito. They visited Poland and Finland to participate in the celebrations for the 100th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relationship between Japan and the two countries. In August 2019, the couple and their son, Hisahito, arrived to Bhutan for a visit.\n\nThe proclamation of Prince Akishino as crown prince did not take place on 19 April 2020, and was later cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nCrown Prince Akishino is a big fan of the Beatles and an avid tennis player.

Produced with Kristoffer Rygg, together with Knut Magne Valle and Tore Ylwizaker, it was issued on 17 December 1998 via Jester Records. It is a musical adaptation of William Blake's poem \"The Marriage of Heaven and Hell\". The album blends electronics, industrial music elements, progressive metal, avant-garde rock and ambient passages, following Blake's plates as track indexes. Stine Grytøyr, Ihsahn, Samoth and Fenriz all feature as guest vocalists.\n\nThe album received widespread acclaim from critics within the rock, metal and alternative music press, being awarded \"Album of the Month\" in several high-profile magazines such as \"Terrorizer\", \"Metal Hammer\", and \"Rock Hard\" and ranked very highly in their end of year's best polls. However, the band's new electronic sound alienated many fans of their first three albums, causing a backlash from the black metal scene.\n\nIn late 1997, Kristoffer Rygg invited keyboardist, sound conceptualist, and composer Tore Ylwizaker into the collective, and together they devised a plan for \"The Blake Album\". Musically, the album transcended black metal's aesthetics to create a genre-defying work and incorporated everything from ambient and classical sounds to industrial, progressive metal, and art rock.\n\nRygg stated, \"For me \"the Blake record\" kind of signifies the second chapter or the new beginning – newer if you will – and not only from an ideological or lyrical perspective, but also musically because by that time I had acquired knowledge on technology and how to work with software and computers so we kind of had the knowledge to do new things with music. In a way it's quite natural that we wanted to explore other things almost from the beginning, which I think the second album, \"Kveldssanger\", is a good example of. So we were never, like, strictly into black metal. It's actually pretty natural. I think a lot of people tend to think of it as very weird or very strange that the focus shifted so radically, but I don't.\"\n\nThe album and the band in general received considerable backlash from the black metal community for abruptly changing musical styles, though the band expressly claimed to not be part of the \"so-called black metal scene\" in the liner notes of the booklet. While black metal purists were taken aback by the experimentation of the album, it was responsible for introducing Ulver to a far wider audience. The shift in musical direction also caused discontent between Rygg and German label Century Media, resulting in the band being dropped from the roster and Rygg subsequently forming his own label, Jester Records.\n\nRygg, commenting in \"Unrestrained\" magazine in 2007, said, \"We spent a couple of years designing [this album], so that was by far the most serious and elaborate musical process we undertook at the time. I had started getting into computers and how you could use different software to manipulate sounds, and that led to the expansion of the palette, and how we made music. That was an interest which was there from the beginning. I think the whole perception that we just made a 180-degree shift towards something else is not entirely correct. I think we just wanted to leave the black metal thing because we felt it was limiting. Our perspectives on religion and society had started to become more difficult as well. That's why Blake was hugely interesting to us, because it was just so much more of a meticulous vision than the dissentient perspective we were part of at the time. You're always more angry when you're young and you become more moderate as you grow older so that's why Blake was fascinating to us. That was the start of chapter two, if you will, of our history.\" Continuing, \"I was hugely into Coil and I found their music to be immensely fascinating. I checked out all their references – chaos magick, Alfred Jarry, Austin Spare and Blake and so forth. I was in London in '96 on a trip together with Ihsahn of Emperor and we went to this place, Atlantis Bookshop, a quite legendary bookstore for occult literature and stuff like that. I picked up a beautiful copy of \"The Marriage of Heaven and Hell\" and it just blew me away. I totally identified with his (Blake) way of seeing things, even though it is profoundly personal stuff.\"\n\nThe avant-garde electronic and progressive metal approach and clean vocal style of the album are similar to those employed by Rygg on the Arcturus album \"La Masquerade Infernale\", released a year earlier.\n\n\"Themes from William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell\" was met with critical acclaim at the time of its release, with most reviewers commenting on the drastic change in musical direction, and the ambitious task of setting William Blake's poem to music.\n\nWriting for AllMusic, Jason Hundy commented, “Every single album they put out is almost a complete 180 from the last, which, although strange, is a very admirable quality to this band, and \"Marriage\" is no different. Between the eerie music, awkward vocals, and mysterious religious lyrics, this album has everything for the eccentric fans out in metal-land.”\n\nOliver Side, writing for avantgarde-metal.com, comments, “\"[The Blake Album is]\" clearly a great step outside what they previously had been associated with, namely black metal. The whole double album is very genre-schizophrenic, as there are also more moody, almost ambient-like acoustic tracks, and all the musical focus is put on each of Blake's inspirational shifts of emotions, so it basically changes all the time.”\n\nWebzine Metal Reviews concluded \"\"Themes from William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell\" may be messy and perhaps a little too ambitious for its own good, but yet it prevails because it's so damn brave. A complete musical reboot, and as such it has its flaws. As their peers floundered around them, Ulver took flight, and if they hadn't chosen to abandon metal entirely, they may not have even existed today.\"\n\nReviewer John Chedsey commented, “The shift into yet another musical realm should come as no surprise to anyone who has kept tabs on this group of musicians. Ulver's artistic vision extends beyond simply the area where they began.”\n\nGiven this diversity, the response from the metal media came highly unexpected: 10/10 points in Rock Hard (D); 7/7 points and \"Album of the Month\" in Hammer Magazine (D); \"Album of the Month\" in Terrorizer (UK); 15/15 in Deftone (D); 15/15 in Legacy (D); 10/10 in Psycho (IT); and 12/12 in Thrash'em All (POL).\n\n"}

During his long umpiring career, he became a much-loved figure among players and viewing public, due to his excellence as an umpire, but also his many eccentricities.\n\nBird played first-class cricket for Yorkshire and Leicestershire as a right-handed batsman, but only scored two centuries in 93 appearances. His career was blighted by a knee injury, which eventually caused him to retire aged 31. He umpired in 66 Test matches (at the time a world record) and 69 One Day Internationals including 3 World Cup Finals.\n\nIn February 2014, Yorkshire announced that Bird was to be voted in as the club's president at their Annual General Meeting on 29 March. His autobiography sold more than a million copies.\n\nBird was born in Barnsley, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, the son of a miner, he gained the nickname 'Dickie' at school. Bird failed his 11-plus and went to Raley Secondary Modern School, leaving in 1948 at the age of 15. For a while, he worked at a coal mine on the surface, but gave it up, deciding it was not for him. Instead, he set out for a career in sport.\n\nWhen a knee injury put paid to playing football professionally, he followed his second love, cricket. In his early career in Barnsley, he played club cricket in the same team as Geoff Boycott, and journalist and chat show host Michael Parkinson, who became a lifelong friend. In 1956, Bird signed up with his home county, Yorkshire. Boycott has spoken highly of Bird's ability as a batsman, but feels that his attempt to forge a career as a county cricketer was hampered by his inability to control his nerves – although he was also not helped by stiff competition for the opening batsman's position: indeed, the very match after scoring his first (and only) County Championship century of 181*, scored in the absence of the regular opener Ken Taylor (playing for MCC), he was dropped when Taylor returned from international duty. Bird played only five more championship matches that season (plus the MCC versus Champion County match), four in the middle order rather than his preferred opener's position, and spent most of the season as \"twelfth man\": hardly a situation conducive to building confidence in his batting. Shortly before the start of the 1960 season he moved to Leicestershire, where he enjoyed a more or less regular place in the team at first – scoring over 1000 runs in his first season of 1960, including a century against the touring South Africans, which would prove to be his only other first-class century – but latterly faded out of the team, thanks to a combination of loss of form, confidence and a recurrence of his persistent knee injury: playing his last match in 1964. Overall, between 1956 and 1964, Bird played first-class cricket as a batsman for Yorkshire and Leicestershire in 93 matches, mostly in the English County Championship. After his county career, he coached and played league cricket before becoming an umpire.\n\nHe stood in his first county game in 1970. Three years later, he officiated at his first Test match, England v New Zealand at Headingley in Leeds. The other umpire was Charlie Eliott as England won by an innings and one run. Bird was to umpire again twice more that summer, in the second and third tests of the tour by the West Indies – both of which proved eventful: in the second test at Edgbaston, Bird had to umpire from the bowler's end at both ends for couple of overs, with a substitute umpire at square leg, when Arthur Fagg refused to continue in protest against the conduct of the West Indian players. And then at Lords, play was interrupted by an IRA bomb scare (later found out to be a hoax). While the crowd cleared out of the ground in record time, Bird and the players sat down in the centre of the pitch, knowing there was no bomb there. He gained a reputation for stopping play for weather, and almost never giving batsmen out LBW – he gave LBWs so seldom that if he did give it, there was absolutely no doubt the batsman was out. Bird was also very strict on the definitions of \"intimidatory bowling\", both from short-pitched deliveries and high full tosses, and made it abundantly clear he would tolerate none of it.\n\nBird's attention to detail was placed under scrutiny at the Centenary Test between England and Australia at Lord's in 1980. Although the Saturday of this particular match had mostly pleasant sunshine, Bird and his fellow umpire, David Constant, refused to let play start because of the previous night's rain; parts of the outfield were still too waterlogged, according to the officials. Angry Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) members scuffled with Constant as he and the team captains returned to the Long Room after their fifth pitch inspection. The two captains, Ian Botham and Greg Chappell, had to intervene to protect Constant. Bird, however, was still on the pitch at the time according to his own recounting of the event in his book. When play finally started at 3:45 pm, police had to escort the umpires through the Long Room and on to the field. This was not the only occasion in which Bird had to stop play, despite current sunny conditions, because of previous bad weather: in the 1988 Test at Headingley against the West Indies, an overnight rainstorm caused a blocked drain to overflow with a delayed action: the pitch was fine but the bowler's run-up was slowly flooding from underneath, the water level was oozing up over Curtly Ambrose's bootlaces, and Bird's as well when he went over to investigate, and the umpires had to take the players off while the outfield was cleared of water.\n\nA pitch invasion followed the West Indies' 17-run win in the inaugural Cricket World Cup. A number of players and umpires had items of their playing outfits \"souvenired\" by the crowd. A year later, Bird was a passenger on a bus in South London, when he noticed the conductor was wearing a white hat very similar to the one he favoured, and asked the conductor where he obtained it from.\n\"Man, haven't you heard of Mr Dickie Bird,\" he replied. \"This is one of his hats. I took it off his head at the World Cup final... we all ran onto the field and I won the race.\"\n\nOne of Bird's strengths was that he was able to manage and earn the respect of some of the more volatile players in the game, sometimes by using his infectious humour. He was also known as being eccentric, famously arriving at a ground five hours early as the Queen was to visit that day.\n\nAt the beginning of his 66th and final Test in 1996, the two teams – India and England – formed a \"guard of honour\" as he came out, and he received a standing ovation from the crowd. Bird, an emotional man, was in tears. His eyes had to clear quickly, though, because two minutes later he had to give England captain Mike Atherton out LBW in the first over. Two years later, in 1998, he stood in his last county match.\n\nBird umpired in 66 Test matches (at the time a world record) and 69 One Day Internationals including 3 World Cup Finals.\n\nHe came out of retirement in January 2007 to umpire in the XXXX Gold Beach Cricket Tri-Nations series involving cricketing legends from England, the West Indies and Australia, which partly took place at Scarborough Beach in Perth, Western Australia, Australia.\n\nBird went on to write his autobiography simply titled \"My Autobiography\" (with a foreword by Michael Parkinson), which sold more than a million copies. A sequel titled \"White Cap and Bails – Adventures of a Much Travelled Umpire\" was published in 1999 by Hodder and Stoughton. Bird set up the Dickie Bird Foundation to help disadvantaged under-18s achieve their potential in sport.\n\nHe was the subject of \"This Is Your Life\" in 1992 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel at Yorkshire Television.\n\nIn 2000, Bird cut the first slice of the Millennium Pie which had been baked in the world-famous \"pie village\" of Denby Dale, home to the Denby Dale Pie Company.\n\nBird appeared in one episode of \"Trigger Happy TV\". In 2010 he took part in BBC's \"The Young Ones\", in which six celebrities in their seventies and eighties, attempted to overcome some of the problems of ageing, by harking back to the 1970s.\n\nBird was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1986 and Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to cricket and charity. Bird has also received honorary doctorates from Huddersfield, Leeds and Sheffield Hallam Universities. Bird has been given the Freedom of Barnsley.\n\nBird is also a Patron of the Barnsley Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n\nA six-foot statue of Bird erected in his honour near the place of his birth in Barnsley was unveiled on 30 June 2009. It has subsequently been raised by putting it on a five-foot-high plinth in order to discourage late night revellers hanging inappropriate items on the famous finger.\n\nOn his pending appointment as President of Yorkshire CC in 2014, Bird stated \"Never in my wildest dreams did I think that I would become the president of the greatest cricket club in the world\".\n\nIn August 2014, Bird was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to \"The Guardian\" expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's referendum on that issue.\n\n\n"}

Spoken Slovene is often considered to have at least 48 dialects (\"narečja\") and subdialects (\"govori\"). The exact number of dialects is open to debate, ranging from as many as 50 to merely 7. The various dialects are so different from each other that a speaker of one dialect may have a very difficult time understanding a speaker of another, particularly if they belong to different regional groups. Speakers of dialects that strongly differ accommodate each other by gravitating toward standard Slovene. Slovene dialects are part of the South Slavic dialect continuum, transitioning into Serbo-Croatian to the south and bordering Friulian and Italian to the west, German to the north, and Hungarian to the east.\n\nThe first attempts to classify Slovenian dialects were made by Izmail Sreznevsky in the early 19th century, followed by Jan Niecisław Baudouin de Courtenay (focusing on Resia, Venetian Slovenia, Cerkno, and Bled), Karel Štrekelj (focusing on the Karst), and Ivan Scheinig (focusing on Carinthia). This was followed by efforts by Ivan Grafenauer (Gail Valley), Josip Tominšek (Savinja Valley), and others. Efforts before the Second World War were spearheaded by Lucien Tesnière, Fran Ramovš, and Aleksander Isachenko, and after the war by Tine Logar and Jakob Rigler (). Eventually, the classification proposed by Ramovš was accepted with corrections and additions by Logar and Rigler, published in 1983 as the \"Karta slovenskih narečij\" (Map of Slovenian Dialects).\n\nThe division of Slovenian into dialects is based on various non-linguistic and linguistic factors. Non-linguistic factors include settlement patterns and geographical features (rivers, mountains) that helped shape various isoglosses. Linguistic factors include language contact with non-Slavic languages to some extent, phonological and prosodic elements in particular, and to a lesser extent word-formational, lexical, and inflectional elements. Specifically, the primary distinguishing linguistic features are 1) preservation or loss of pitch accent, 2) reflexes of nasal *\"ę\", nasal *\"ǫ\", jat (\"ě\"), and the yers (\"ъ, ь\"), and 3) (to a lesser extent) vowel inventory, diphthongization, and degree and type of vowel reduction.\n\nThe main regional groups are:\n\n\nThe following grouping of dialects and subdialects is based on the 1983 map of Slovene dialects by Fran Ramovš, Tine Logar, and Jakob Rigler () (from which the first Slovene term listed in parentheses is taken) and other sources.\n\n"}
{"id": "1949546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949546", "title": "Warren Harding (climber)", "text": "Warren Harding (climber)\n\nWarren Harding (June 18, 1924 – February 27, 2002) was one of the most accomplished and influential American rock climbers of the 1950s to 1970s. He was the leader of the first team to climb El Capitan, Yosemite Valley, in 1958. The route they climbed, known as The Nose, ascends up the central buttress of what is one of the largest granite monoliths in the world. Harding climbed many other first ascents in Yosemite, some 28 in all, as well as making the first true big-wall ascents in the Sierra Nevada range of California.\n\nHe was nicknamed \"Batso\", a reference to his remarkable penchant for spending days living on vertical cliffs and his exuberant and iconoclastic character. Harding developed specialized equipment for climbing big walls, such as the \"bat tent\" for sleeping, and \"bat hooks\" used to hook precariously on small cut-out bits of granite—examples of his B.A.T. or 'Basically Absurd Technology' products. He was known for his doggedness, drinking, and farcing, as reflected in his motto: \"Semper Farcisimus!\"\n\nHarding authored the book \"Downward Bound: A Mad! Guide to Rock Climbing\". The book contains a description of the ascent of the Nose and the Wall of Early Morning Light (1970), as well as farcical instruction in climbing basics, ratings of prominent climbers of the period, a humorous account of rock climbing controversies and life-styles of the 1960s and 1970s, and a vivid portrayal of Harding's own rebellious and charismatic character.\n\nHarding was raised in Downieville, California, in the northern part of the historic gold country near Lake Tahoe by a family from Iowa that had arrived before the Great Depression. Harding grew up entertaining himself, preferring hiking to fishing after he realized that he was a \"terrible fisherman\". He began mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada in the late 1940s on Mount Whitney, the Palisades, and the Minarets. He took up technical climbing in 1953; it was, he said, the first thing he was ever really good at, because he \"could do only what required brute stupidity\".\n\nWithin a year, Harding was an active figure in the nascent climbing community of Yosemite Valley, the huge glacial valley in which big-wall or multi-day vertical technical or roped rock climbing developed in the United States after World War II. He began pushing the limits of the sport in the 1950s, and quickly became one of the \"stone masters\" of his day. The hardest climb of the era, the Lost Arrow Spire Chimney, has a horrible, squeezing, dark and difficult pitch named for his lead: the \"Harding Hole\". He scrabbled his way up a demanding fissure called the \"Worst Error\" on Elephant Rock, an early effort which the British Guardian journalist Jim Perrin notes, \"bears comparison with the achievements of Joe Brown and Don Whillans\", famed contemporaries of his in Britain. He pioneered a famous one-day climb up the East Buttress of Middle Cathedral Rock, today one of the most-climbed routes of its nature in Yosemite Valley.\nHarding's first major rock climb lay right nearby: the North Buttress of Middle Cathedral Rock in Yosemite. Beginning \"impromptu\" with a \"stranger\" who Harding thought was \"nuttier than a fruitcake\", he and Frank Tarver soon passed another party. They joined up since one group had ability but lacked equipment and the other had equipment but lacked ability. Together, after four nights out, and 20 or more rope lengths of climbing, they made the top of the long and involved route. They had just finished the longest roped rock climb to date in North America.\n\nSuccess for Harding in the establishment world, however, was always secondary, or out of reach. The draft board rejected him due to his heart murmur, and after working as a propeller mechanic during World War II, he trained as a land surveyor, holding a union card proudly his whole life. Known for his short stature and high voice, his hard drinking and fast cars, his greaser style black hair-do, good looks, and libidinous orientation, Harding recounts in his memoir \"Downward Bound\" that he chose the book's title because it reflected the failure of his career as a responsible wage-earner in the face of his urge to go rock climbing.\n\nWithin the year, Harding was teaming up with Mark Powell, one of the premier Yosemite climbers of the 1950s. After Harding had been part of a group which failed to climb the magnificent and vertical Northwest face of Half Dome, he and Powell found themselves in the Valley, too late by a couple of days to make the first ascent of that feature as another group, led by Harding's southern Californian rival, Royal Robbins, had just completed it.\n\nHarding recounted meeting the group at the top: \"My congratulations were hearty and sincere, but inside, the ambitious dreamer in me was troubled.\" He, Powell, and equipment inventor Bill 'Dolt' Feuerer later conspired: \"In the fit of egotistical pique, we grumbled around the Valley for a couple of days, trying to figure out what to do. The solution was simple; any climb less than Half Dome was beneath us; only a great climb would do.\" At this point, as big wall historian Doug Scott notes, Harding was truly exceptional. The face of El Capitan was so 'appallingly higher' than the other features in Yosemite, it was 'ignored by the majority of climbers'.\n\nHarding, Powell, and Feuerer began in July 1957. Unlike the single-push 'alpine' style used on Half Dome, they chose to fix lines between 'camps' in the style used in the Himalaya. Attempting to get halfway on the first push, they were foiled by the long hand sized and larger cracks. Frank Tarver cut the legs off of several wood stoves, and gave the team these \"proto-type bong pitons. These crack systems later became world famous as the \"Stove Legs Cracks\".\n\nCompelled by the National Park Service to stop until after Labor Day due to the crowds forming in El Capitan meadows, the team had a major setback when Powell suffered a compound leg fracture on another climbing trip. Powell dropped out, and Feuerer became disillusioned. Harding, true to his legendary endurance and willingness to find new partners, 'continued', as he later put it, 'with whatever \"qualified\" climbers I could con into this rather unpromising venture.' Feuerer stayed on as technical advisor, even constructing a bicycle wheeled 'cart' which could be hauled up to the half-way ledge which bears his name today, 'Dolt Tower'; but Wayne Merry, George Whitmore, and Rich Calderwood now became the main team, with Merry sharing lead chores with Harding.\n\nIn the Fall, two more pushes got them to the level. Finally, a fourth push starting in the late Fall would likely be the last. The team had originally fixed their route with manila lines; and their \"in situ\" lines would have weakened more over the winter. In the cooling November environment, they worked their way slowly upward, with the seven days it took to push to within the last 300 feet blurring into a 'monotonous grind' if, Harding adds, 'living and working 2500 feet above the ground on a granite face' could be considered 'monotonous'. After sitting out a storm for three days at this level, they hammered their way up the final portion. Harding struggled fifteen hours and placed 28 expansion bolts by hand through the night up an overhanging headwall, topping out at 6 AM. The whole thing had taken 45 days, with more than of climbing including huge 'pendulum' swings across the face; and uncounted 'mileage' of laboriously hauling bags with prusik knots up ropes and sliding by 'rappelling' back down.\n\nThe team had finished what is by any standard one of the 'great classics' of modern rock climbing. The Nose Route is often called the most famous rock climbing route in North America, and in good Fall weather can have anywhere between three and ten different parties strung out along its thirty rope lengths to the top. On the 50th anniversary of the ascent, the US House of Representatives passed a resolution honoring the achievement of the original party.\n\nFollowing his climb of El Capitan, Harding put up the overhanging East Face of Washington Column in Yosemite, renamed \"Astroman\" after it was climbed without aid, the first of a row of serious routes he did with his partner of this period, photographer Glen Denny. This was followed by: the wildly overhanging Leaning Tower, also done with Denny and still one of the most popular big-wall routes in Yosemite; the North Face of the 'Rostrum' just outside Yosemite Valley, again with Denny (a notoriously hard and spectacular later one-day testpiece as a free climb); and the beautiful and isolated face of Mount Watkins across from Half Dome, done with Yvon Chouinard and Chuck Pratt (with 'hard man' Harding famously refusing water on the parched last days of the climb to save it for those doing the final leads).\n\nHarding also pioneered big wall ascents in the Sierra Nevada, with routes such as the face of the more than Keeler Needle on the side of Mt. Whitney and the South West Face of Mt. Conness in the Yosemite high country.\n\nHarding and climber-photographer Galen Rowell nearly succumbed to a storm on the difficult and tedious, but strikingly beautiful, South Face of Half Dome in 1970. After a rescue and later difficulties, one partner, Joe Faint, abandoned the project. Rowell recounted his worries when Harding didn't show up one weekend: \"The next weekend, as we hike up the steep trail to Half Dome, I stop feeling sorry for Warren when he limps past me with a huge pack. Half of Warren is still twice the average man.\" Unsuccessful and unpleasant jaunts working as a contractor in Vietnam and a serious accident—a truck hit him while working at a construction site, leaving him permanently disabled—did not stop Harding from returning and finishing the climb.\nHarding also made a much-publicised first ascent of the \"Wall of the Early Morning Light\", up the tallest portion of El Capitan in its southeast side. With Dean Caldwell, he spent 27 nights on the wall, living mostly in tented hammocks designed in coordination with Roger Derryberry. When a 4-day storm rolled in, the National Park Service decided, after 22 days, that the two needed to be rescued. Ropes were lowered, but after much shouting back and forth, retracted. Harding, in his book \"Downward Bound\", recounts what might have happened had the rescue persisted:\n\nHarding is the most notorious tippler in the history of modern rock climbing famous for its working class public house and campground tradition. Harding preferred gallon jugs of the very cheapest variant of red, and named the creaky ledge holding their hammocks, and from which they were supposed to be rescued, \"wino tower\". \"Had the rescue team been overzealous,\" he continues, \"a wild insane fight with piton hammers might have ensued. For we were very determined not to be hauled off our climb.\" Seven days later, after 27 nights on the cliff, they pulled over the top to a throng of reporters, well-wishers, the curious and the critical.\n\nHarding's climbing style was considered controversial because he was more willing to employ artificial aids which become a permanent part of the environment, especially expansion bolts. These take a long time to put in, but are not removable, and as they can be put anywhere, take some of the skill and the risk out of rock climbing. Some critics, such as historian Steve Roper, English \"Mountain\" magazine editor Ken Wilson, and southern Californians like Robbins and Yvon Chouinard, felt that Harding's flamboyant willingness to use expansion bolts took some of the adventure away from climbing.\n\nHarding granted that some of those climbers had more skills than he, but always disputed their \"zealotry\" and \"purity\". He also argued that it was hypocrisy to accuse him of publicity hounding, as many of them developed lucrative mountain climbing businesses, making tens of thousands, if not millions of dollars a year selling clothing and equipment. This controversy reached a high point when Harding's chief rival, Robbins, began the second ascent of his Early Morning Light route, hanging in Harding and Caldwell's bolt and bat-hook holes, and then cutting off the hangers, declaring he wished to restore the rock to its pristine state—and making a third ascent unlikely. The irritated Harding called the southerner Robbins a \"Carrie Nation\" of rockclimbers, and felt vindicated when Robbins eventually decided the climb was harder than it looked and then respected it by not cutting any more bolts as he and Don Lauria completed the second ascent.\n\nLito Tejada-Flores, whose essay \"Games Climbers Play\", was influential at the time of Harding's exploits, viewed Harding as 'outside' the game as it was played by most. Harding was rather 'inventing new ones' and 'from time to time, even a masterpiece.' That was how he described the 28-day Dawn Wall event: 'a great climb whose greatness is...in the experiential content of such extended \"life on a wall\".'\n\nAfter the 1980s, Harding did very little climbing, retiring to the northern hills of the Sierra Nevada, going hot-air ballooning with his close friends Mary-Lou Long and Roger Derryberry, and continuing his love of cheap red wine. He died in 2002.\n\nHarding describes reaching the top of El Capitan:\n\nHarding on his legendary endurance:\n\nHarding, on drinking, satirizing the American Alpine Club's \"Accident Reports\":\n\nHarding's \"Reflections on a Broken Down Climber\":\n\n\n\n\n"}

The island is equidistant to Port Clinton, OH and Kingsport, Ontario, Canada\n\nThe 688.6-acre (2.786 km²) island is one of few islands that has not been commercially developed. The state of Ohio purchased 589 acres (2.4 km²) of the island to preserve it from development and operates it as North Bass Island State Park.\n\nHistorically, North Bass was mainly used as a vineyard. According to the 2000 census the island had 13 permanent residents. As of January 2007, there were roughly two dozen permanent residents residing on the island's 12 privately owned properties.\n\nNorth Bass Island Airport offers a paved airstrip. Air traffic for take-off and landings to the north are complex as the Canadian border is challenging to avoid with less than two (2) miles from the runway threshold.

KLVE is essentially the same programming as Univision's corporate \"Amor\" format used elsewhere.\n\nIn March 2019, the station became the flagship for Univision's new Uforia Audio Network.\nKLVE's morning show has been co-hosted by the husband-and-wife duo of Omar Velasco and Argelia Atilano (1993 graduate of Garfield High School in East Los Angeles) since 2003.\n\nKLVE broadcasts three channels in HD. While the primary channel simulcasts the station’s FM signal, channels HD2 and HD3 air Armenian-language and Persian-language programming, respectively.\n"}

{"id": "1949566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949566", "title": "Louise Bryant", "text": "Louise Bryant\n\nLouise Bryant (December 5, 1885 – January 6, 1936) was an American feminist, political activist, and journalist best known for her sympathetic coverage of Russia and the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution. Bryant, who married fellow journalist John Reed (her second husband) in 1916, wrote about Russian leaders such as Katherine Breshkovsky, Maria Spiridonova, Alexander Kerensky, Vladimir Lenin, and Leon Trotsky. Her news stories, distributed by Hearst during and after her trips to Petrograd and Moscow, appeared in newspapers across the United States and Canada in the years immediately following World War I. A collection of articles from her first trip was published in 1918 as \"Six Red Months in Russia\". Over the next year, she defended the revolution in testimony before the Overman Committee, a Senate subcommittee established to investigate Bolshevik influence in the United States. Later in 1919, she undertook a nationwide speaking tour to encourage public support of the Bolsheviks and to denounce armed U.S. intervention in Russia.\n\nBorn Anna Louise Mohan, as a young girl she began using the last name of her stepfather, Sheridan Bryant, in preference to that of her father. She grew up in rural Nevada and attended the University of Nevada in Reno and the University of Oregon in Eugene, graduating with a degree in history in 1909. Pursuing a career in journalism, she became society editor of the \"Spectator\" and freelanced for \"The Oregonian\", newspapers in Portland, Oregon. During her years in that city (1909–1915), she became active in the women's suffrage movement. Leaving her first husband in 1915 to follow Reed to Greenwich Village, she formed friendships with leading feminists of the day, some of whom she met through Reed's associates at publications such as \"The Masses\"; at meetings of a women's group, Heterodoxy; and through work with the Provincetown Players. During a National Woman's Party suffrage rally in Washington, D.C., in 1919, she was arrested and spent three days in jail. Both she and Reed took lovers outside marriage; during her Greenwich Village years (1916–1920) for her these included the playwright Eugene O'Neill and the painter Andrew Dasburg.\n\nAfter Reed's death from typhus in 1920, Bryant continued to write for Hearst about Russia and also about Turkey, Hungary, Greece, Italy, and other countries in Europe and the Middle East. Some articles from this period were collected in 1923 under the title \"Mirrors of Moscow\". Later that year she married William C. Bullitt, Jr., with whom she had her only child, Anne, the following year. Suffering in her later years from the rare and painful disorder adiposis dolorosa, Bryant did little writing or publishing in her last decade, and drank heavily. Bullitt, winning sole custody of Anne, divorced Bryant in 1930. Bryant died in Paris in 1936 and was buried in Versailles. In 1998, a group from Portland restored her grave, which had become neglected.\n\nAnna Louise Mohan was born in 1885 in San Francisco, California. Her father, Hugh Mohan, born in Pennsylvania, became a journalist and stump speaker involved in labor issues and Democratic Party politics. Moving to San Francisco, he continued to write for newspapers, and in 1880 he married Louisa Flick, who grew up on the ranch of her stepfather, James Say, near Humboldt Lake in Nevada. The Mohans had two children, Barbara (1880) and Louis (1882), before the birth of Anna Louise. Later in 1885, the family moved to Reno, where Mohan continued his journalistic career but drank heavily. One day he departed and never returned to his wife and children. Louise's mother divorced him in 1889 and married Sheridan Bryant, a freight conductor on the Southern Pacific railway. The couple had two children, Floyd (1894) and William (1896). Although the family lived in Wadsworth, Nevada, Louise accepted an invitation from James Say to live at his ranch. She remained there for three or four years, returning to Wadsworth at her mother's insistence at the age of 12. Bryant adopted her stepfather's last name, but never changed it legally from Mohan.\nAttending high school in Wadsworth and Reno and college at Nevada State University (now known as the University of Nevada, Reno), Bryant developed interests in journalism, debate, illustration, social life, dancing, and basketball. She edited the \"Young Ladies Edition\" of the \"Student Record\" in 1905, wrote a short story, \"The Way of a Flirt\", for a literary magazine, \"Chuckwalla\", and contributed sketches to it and another publication, \"Artemisia\". Depressed after the death of her step-grandfather in 1906, Bryant left school for a job in Jolon, California, where for a few months she boarded at a cattle ranch and taught children, mostly young Mexicans. That summer she moved to Eugene, Oregon, where her brother Louis worked for the Southern Pacific.\n\nAfter learning that she could transfer her college credits from Nevada, she enrolled at the University of Oregon, in Eugene. Popular at the school, which then had a total student enrollment of less than 500, she helped start a small sorority, Zeta Iota Phi (a chapter of Chi Omega), and served as its first president. During her time in Eugene, she produced poems and pen-and-ink sketches for the \"Oregon Monthly\". In a small city steeped in \"puritan moralism\", she was the first to wear rouge on campus; she had multiple boyfriends, and she wore clothes that Miriam Van Waters, the editor of the \"Oregon Monthly\", and Luella Clay Carson, the dean of women, considered improper. Taking off the spring semester of 1908 to teach in a one-room schoolhouse on Stuart Island, one of the San Juan Islands near the U.S. border with Canada, she returned to Eugene to finish her bachelor's degree in history, graduating in early 1909. Her senior thesis was on the Modoc Indian Wars.\n\nIn the spring of 1909, Bryant moved to Portland, first sharing a downtown apartment with one of her college friends, Clara Wold, then renting her own apartment in the same building. Among her jobs, she designed a stained-glass window for the Povey Brothers, worked as a freelance reporter for \"The Oregonian\", and became an illustrator and society editor for the \"Portland Spectator\", a weekly news magazine. Meanwhile, she formed friendships with people—such as Cas Baer, drama editor for \"The Oregonian\"—who were interested in journalism and the arts. In late 1909, she met and married Paul Trullinger, a dentist who lived on a houseboat on the Willamette River, collected art, and liked drinking parties that sometimes included invitations to his office to inhale ether.\n\nBryant, who retained her maiden name and her downtown apartment after her marriage to Trullinger, bridled at doing housework and yearned for professional advancement. Drawn toward politics and the women's suffrage movement by her friend Sara Bard Field, she joined the Oregon branch of the College Equal Suffrage League in 1912. She and Field gave pro-suffrage speeches in smaller Oregon cities, and Bryant rode on the suffrage float in Portland's annual Flag Day parade. Led by Abigail Scott Duniway, women achieved suffrage in Oregon later that year.\n\nBryant became familiar with the socialist journal \"The Masses\" through Portland resident and lawyer C. E. S. Wood, who eventually married Field and who often contributed to the magazine. Enthusiastic about its contents, particularly articles by Portland native John Reed, Bryant began raising subscriptions for it. Emma Goldman, a well-known anarchist whom Wood had defended in court, gave a speech in Reed's honor at the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) hall in Portland. She and other political activists, such as Alexander Berkman, were among guests entertained by Bryant and her husband. In 1914, Reed, a Harvard graduate and established writer who by then lived in Greenwich Village, came home for a visit, during which he spoke at the University Club of Portland against the class system. Exactly how or when or how often Bryant and Reed met is uncertain, but near Christmas 1915 when Reed again came home to visit his widowed mother, the young couple announced their love at a dinner party. Reed returned to Greenwich Village on December 28, and Bryant, abandoning her marriage, followed him three days later. Trullinger filed for divorce, which was granted in July 1916, on grounds of desertion.\n\n Reed had rented a room for Bryant near his apartment at 43 Washington Square. Their unmarried co-habitation caused little curiosity among Reed's friends in the Village, many of whom rejected marriage and other middle-class norms. Unified by an \"air of intellectual freedom, moral laissez-faire and camaraderie\", most were involved in literary, artistic, or political pursuits in a Bohemian neighborhood that in some ways resembled the Left Bank of Paris. While visiting New York, Field took Bryant to a meeting of Heterodoxy, a women's group that included feminist Charlotte Perkins Gilman, journalist Mary Heaton Vorse, political activist Crystal Eastman, actress Ida Rauh, writers Zona Gale and Mary Austin, and many others. Among Bryant's new friends were feminists Inez Milholland, Inez Gillmore, and Doris Stevens. Other notables circulating in the Village included Emma Goldman, playwright Eugene O'Neill, and one of Reed's former lovers, arts patron Mabel Dodge.\n\nAt Number 43, Bryant and Reed pursued their journalistic endeavors in separate work rooms. Four months after leaving Oregon, Bryant broke into print in New York with an article about two Portland judges, one of whom had dismissed a case brought against Goldman for distributing birth-control information. It was published as \"Two Judges\" in the April 1916 issue of \"The Masses\", edited by Max Eastman, Crystal Eastman's brother. Meanwhile, Reed, who had reported on the 1913 Paterson silk strike, Pancho Villa in 1913–14, and the ongoing war (World War I) in Europe, went on assignment for \"Collier's\" to interview William Jennings Bryan in Florida.\n\nLater that spring Bryant and Reed heeded Vorse's call to spend the warm season in Provincetown, Massachusetts, at the tip of Cape Cod, and to take part in the communal theater productions of the Provincetown Players. Others from the Village went as well and joined the group, organized in 1915 by George Cram Cook and his wife, Susan Glaspell, who hoped to produce plays that were both political and artistic. Among the works the group staged in 1916 were Bryant's \"The Game\", in which characters named Life and Death play dice for the lives of Youth (a poet) and Girl (a dancer). It appeared on the same bill as \"Not Smart\" by Wilbur Steele and \"Bound East for Cardiff\" by O'Neill.\n\nDuring the summer, Reed left Cape Cod to cover the Progressive Party convention in Chicago, and at other times he retreated from the players to work on articles for \"Collier's\" and \"Metropolitan Magazine\". During these absences, Bryant and O'Neill became lovers, not surprising in a group that professed and practiced free love. Reed, made aware of this new development, responded by inviting O'Neill to begin taking his meals with them. In a note to Field, Bryant said that her relationship with Reed was \"so beautiful and so free! ... We don't \"interfere\" with each other at all ... we feel like children who will never grow up.\"\n\n After spending the month of September 1916 in a cottage they bought in Truro, Bryant and Reed returned to Greenwich Village, where the Provincetown Players planned to establish an alternative to Broadway theater. On weekends, they sojourned at Croton-on-Hudson, upriver from New York City, where Villagers including Eastman, Dodge, and illustrator Boardman Robinson and his wife had cottages. In October, Bryant and Reed bought their own place in Croton-on-Hudson. Meanwhile, Reed, who had suffered from kidney ailments since childhood, was told by his doctors that he would need to have a kidney removed. The surgery, considered \"gravely serious\", was scheduled for mid-November. Reed wanted to protect Bryant by making her his legal heir, and they married on November 9 at the county clerk's office in Peekskill before Reed left on November 12 for surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.\n\nCompounding their difficulties were Bryant's ongoing relationship with O'Neill and gynecological problems she was treated for while Reed was in the hospital. When he returned from Baltimore in mid-December, Reed and Bryant retreated full-time to Croton-on-Hudson to recuperate and to focus on writing. They made plans to travel to China in 1917 to cover events for American publications, but in January the plans fell through when U.S. entry into World War I against Germany became highly likely. (The U.S. entered the war on April 6.) To boost their finances, they sold the cottage in Truro to Margaret Sanger, and Reed pawned his father's gold watch. At the same time, his strong anti-war positions, enunciated in \"The Masses\" and elsewhere, alienated most of his employers, further reducing his income. Adding to these stresses was Reed's confession to Bryant that he had had multiple love affairs, and the subsequent unhappiness between Bryant and Reed led to a temporary separation. When she expressed a desire to go to Europe, he helped her convince John N. Wheeler, who had recently formed the Bell Syndicate, to issue her a press pass. Reed paid for her passage, and Bryant set sail in June to cover the war in France. Regrets quickly followed. According to Bryant biographer Virginia Gardner:\n\nNo sooner had they parted on board the ship than both Reed and Bryant were assailed by misgivings. An outpouring of letters from either side of the Atlantic followed. Both were suffering, both were confused, lonely, and miserable ... [The letters were] proof of the basically strong bond that held the two, the poet-reporter and social critic and the erratic, appealing woman he had rescued from the banality of middle-class existence in Portland.\n\nOn the voyage across the Atlantic, Bryant interviewed ambulance-service troops and others on board the \"Espagne\" and wrote news stories about them and about the threat of torpedo attacks. When she arrived in Paris, Bryant tried for several weeks to obtain permission from French authorities to visit the Western Front, but could not do so because of her limited journalistic experience and her sex. She ended up collecting information about the war from as many sources as she could meet in Paris, and sent her news stories to Reed, who edited them and forwarded them to Wheeler.\n\n In mid-August, when Bryant returned from France, Reed met her at the dock and told her to prepare to go to Petrograd four days later to cover the Russian Revolution. Eastman of \"The Masses\" had raised funds to pay Reed's travel expenses, and the Bell Syndicate assigned Bryant to report on the war \"from a woman's point of view\". Leaving New York on August 17, they arrived in Petrograd, which was then the capital of Russia, about six months after the forced abdication of the last Russian czar, Nicholas II. Headed by Alexander Kerensky, the provisional government that had succeeded the czar had already survived an attempted putsch by Major General Lavr Kornilov. Bryant and Reed entered the city after the Kornilov Affair and before the Bolsheviks overthrew the Kerensky government in the October Revolution.\n\nReconciled as a couple, and working from their room at the Angleterre Hotel, Bryant and Reed attended gatherings at the Smolny Institute and elsewhere in Petrograd and interviewed many leading political figures, including Lenin, Trotsky, and Kerensky, and both eventually compiled books—\"Six Red Months in Russia\" by Bryant and Reed's \"Ten Days That Shook the World\"—from their articles. Bryant circulated widely, covering Duma meetings, dining in public mess halls with soldiers and workers, and interviewing women revolutionaries. Among those were Katherine Breshkovsky, known as the \"grandmother of the revolution\", Maria Spiridonova, whom Bryant considered the most powerful woman in Russia, and Aleksandra Kollontai, who became People's Commissar of Social Welfare and the only woman in the Bolshevik cabinet. In the process, Bryant, who had often been overshadowed by her more famous husband, gained confidence in her professional reporting skills. By the time she returned to New York, her work was being read across North America. Gardner says:\n\n[The] springtime of 1918 in the United States was a time of heightened contradictions. Openmindedness about the new Russian experiment in cities and the hinterland coexisted with the intensified patriotism of wartime ... No matter what appeared in their editorial pages, newspaper editors knew that feature stories with first-hand knowledge of the Revolution sold papers. The conservative and Republican Philadelphia \"Public Ledger\" syndicate bought Bryant's thirty-two stories and sold them to Hearst's \"New York American\" and to more than one hundred newspapers over the United States and Canada.\n\nLeaving Russia before Reed, who wanted to report on the Bolshevik debate about Russian participation in the war with Germany, Bryant returned to New York, arriving on February 18, 1918. She found Greenwich Village much changed by the war: old friends had moved, rents had gone up, and tourists were replacing bohemians. Under government pressure, \"The Masses\" had shut down. Working out of a room at the Brevoort Hotel, Bryant wrote articles about the October Revolution and speeches or cables urging support of the workers' government in Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, Reed, who was trying to get home, was unable to get State Department clearance for a visa and was detained in Oslo (then called \"Christiana\"), Norway, for more than a month. His letters were censored, and Bryant did not hear from him directly until April. On orders from Edgar Sisson of the U.S. Commission on Public Information, all of Reed's papers were confiscated when he arrived in New York on April 28. Unable to write about the October Revolution without his notes, Reed instead gave speeches advocating U.S. recognition of the new Russian government. That summer, the couple retreated to Croton-on-Hudson.\n\nIn August, during a long weekend in the arts colony at Woodstock, Bryant began what was to be a long-term, intermittent love affair with painter Andrew Dasburg, with whom she had been close for a couple of years. Returning to the Village in September, Bryant and Reed rented a small house at 1 Patchin Place. Later in the month, Reed was arrested for giving a speech in which he denounced the use of Allied troops in Russia; the specific charge against him was that he had used \"disloyal, scurrilous and abusive language about the Military and Naval Forces of the United States\". He was released on $5,000 bail. In separate cases that year, Reed stood trial with Eastman, Floyd Dell, and others from the former staff of \"The Masses\" for conspiracy to obstruct the draft of men to fight in World War I and for other alleged offenses related to published articles and cartoons; Reed's alleged crime in the latter case was that he had written a headline, \"Knit a Strait-Jacket for Your Soldier Boy\", for an article about mental illness among the U.S. troops. Bryant was questioned in \"The Masses\" cases but not charged. Both trials involving \"The Masses\" ended in hung juries, and the defendants were set free. In October, Bryant's first book, \"Six Red Months in Russia\", was published to \"mostly favorable reviews,\" and Reed resumed work on \"Ten Days That Shook the World\" after the government returned his notes. It would not be published until April 1919.\nIn February 1919, while still based in New York, Bryant went to Washington, D.C., to speak, along with Albert Rhys Williams, about the situation in Russia. She stayed in Washington long enough to participate in a National Woman's Party suffrage rally, during which she was arrested, arraigned, and sentenced to five days in jail. The specific charges against her and others, who had burned President Woodrow Wilson in effigy on the White House lawn, were \"building fires on government property, standing on the coping around the White House, or attempting to make disorderly speeches.\" Among a group of women who refused bail, she spent at least three days in jail, during which she took part in a hunger strike. Upon her release, she insisted on testifying as an unfriendly witness before the Overman Committee, which had been set up to investigate Bolshevik activity in the United States. Deflecting questions about her religious beliefs, marriages, and other personal matters during her two days of testimony, she tried to convince the subcommittee, led by Senator Lee S. Overman, that Russia had a right to self-determination. Soon thereafter, she began a cross-country speaking tour, \"The Truth About Russia\", arranged by Anna Louise Strong, during which she addressed large audiences in Detroit, Chicago, Spokane, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and other American cities. According to Gardner, Bryant was the first woman to defend Lenin and Trotsky at political gatherings across the United States. Gardner writes, \"Her message was simple, 'Hands off Russia!' 'Bring the boys home!'\"\n\nAfter Bryant returned from her lecture tour in May, she and Reed spent the next few months mainly in Croton-on-Hudson writing, gardening, and in Reed's case, recuperating from influenza. In late August, Reed, who had joined the Socialist Party of America, was chosen by one of its factions, the Communist Labor Party of America (CLP), to visit Moscow to seek recognition for the CLP as the sole representative of the Communist International (Comintern) in the United States. Unlike Reed, Bryant avoided party membership. The U.S. government quickly outlawed the CLP and its competitor, the American Communist Party, headed by Louis Fraina. In danger of being arrested and unable to get a passport to go to Russia, Reed, disguised as a stoker, left the United States in late September 1919 on a Scandinavian ship headed for Europe. During the Palmer Raids and Red Scare days beginning in November 1919, he was charged with conspiring to overthrow the government by force. In March 1920, after visiting Moscow, he was arrested and incarcerated in Finland on his way home. Three months later, he was returned to Moscow in a prisoner exchange between the White (anti-Bolshevik) Finns of the Finnish Civil War and the Bolsheviks. From Reval (Tallinn), Estonia, he cabled Bryant, \"Passport home refused. Temporarily returning headquarters. Come if possible.\" Traveling without passport, Bryant, disguised as the wife of a Swedish businessman, arrived in Petrograd in late August 1920.\n\nWhen Bryant reached Petrograd, Reed was in Baku, attending the \"first congress of peoples of the east\" (Oriental Congress) with the Comintern executive committee. He had left a letter for her with several possibilities for lodging, one of which was a room he had arranged for her at the Dielovoy Hotel in Moscow. This is where, on September 15, they finally reconnected, spending the next few days together and visiting Lenin, Trotsky, Hungarian revolutionary Béla Kun, and Enver Pasha, a former minister of war in the Ottoman Empire. Bryant began filing Moscow news stories with the International News Service, which had hired her before she left New York.\n\nA week after Reed's return from Baku, he began to experience dizziness and headaches, thought at first to be symptoms of influenza. Five days later, when he became delirious, doctors diagnosed typhus and sent him to the hospital. There, with Bryant by his side, he died on October 17, 1920, a few days shy of his 33rd birthday. On the day of Reed's funeral, in keeping with Russian custom, Bryant walked alone behind the hearse, at the head of the funeral procession. Fainting during the burial, she awoke in her hotel room. Among those at her bedside were Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, who had been arrested in the United States and deported to Russia in late 1919.\n\nAfter Reed's death, Bryant obtained Lenin's approval for a trip to the southern Russian border and neighboring countries. She went by train over the Kazakh Steppe, through areas hard hit by famine, to Tashkent and Bukhara and to the borders of Iran and Afghanistan, interviewing and taking notes.\nShe returned to the U.S. in mid-summer 1921, and stayed for about a year, during which she first met William Christian Bullitt, Jr., then managing editor of film stories at Paramount, to try to persuade him to make \"Ten Days That Shook the World\" into a film. Bullitt, a Yale University graduate from a Philadelphia family of great wealth, had worked as a journalist specializing in foreign affairs, then as a diplomat in the United States Department of State before retiring temporarily from politics and taking the Paramount job. He later returned to politics and became the first U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union. Bryant and Bullet had in common their interests in Russia, journalism, and Jack Reed, whom Bullitt greatly admired. Although Paramount did not pursue the \"Ten Days\" project, Bullitt was charmed by Bryant and began the amorous pursuit of her that two years later ended in marriage. In August, the \"New York American\", a Hearst newspaper, began publishing a series of 16 of Bryant's articles describing famine in Russia, Lenin's New Economic Policy, the end of the Russian Civil War, and related topics. In general, the tone of these articles was \"sober and at times unsparing, in contrast to her often rapturous reporting in her 1918 stories.\"\n\nIn October, she was the main speaker at a memorial for Reed in New York City, and she spent some of her time collecting Reed's papers for possible publication. She also arranged with King Features Syndicate, another Hearst agency, to return to Russia to write portraits of Russians. The first of these appeared in print in June 1922 and led to her second book, \"Mirrors of Moscow\", in 1923. Bryant's travels in Europe this time included Moscow, Berlin, London, Paris, and other cities. By late October, she was in Rome, accompanied by Bullitt. Here in late 1922, she wrote about Benito Mussolini, the Fascist leader who had just come to power and with whom she had obtained an interview. Gathering material from a variety of sources, including Madame Rachele Mussolini, Bryant wrote a feature article, \"Mussolini Relies Upon Efficiency to Restore Italy\", published in the \"New York American\" in early 1923. She described the future dictator this way:\n\nLeaving Rome to cover the Turkish War of Independence for the International News Service, Bryant lived with Bullitt in a villa in Constantinople in early 1923. While Bullitt worked on a novel, \"It's Not Done\", published in 1926 and dedicated to Bryant, she covered events related to the rise of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the first president of the Republic of Turkey. From her base in Turkey, she ventured to Palermo to interview the deposed king of Greece, Constantine I, and to Athens to interview his son, George II. Shortly thereafter, Bryant suspended her journalistic career to focus on family matters.\n\nLater in 1923, Bryant and Bullitt moved to Paris, where they married in December. Two months later, Bryant gave birth to her only child, Anne Moen Bullitt (1924–2007). In 1925 she and Bullitt added to their family an 8-year-old boy, Refik Ismaili Bey, whom they had met in Turkey. As the wife of a rich man, Bryant had duties related to the running of an upper-class household: \"... the management of servants, the ordering of food and planning of menus, house decoration, flower arrangement, keeping a social calendar.\" She told one visitor to her home that she considered her new life \"useless\", and the Bryant–Bullitt marriage began to unravel. In \"Louise Bryant Grows Old\", historian Christine Stansell examines the great changes in Bryant's life after her marriage to Bullitt:\n\nThe entrance of William Bullitt into Louise Bryant's life confounds the intertwined stories of the grief-stricken war widow, the radical heroine, and the champion of the oppressed. The marriage is a puzzle, both biographically and historically. Biographically, it proved to be a disaster, in contrast to Bryant's earlier romantic choices, which had been smart and fulfilling.\n\nAlthough Bryant continued to write, little of her work toward the end of her life was published. Her last piece of journalism, \"A Turkish Divorce\", about Atatürk's treatment of women, appeared in \"The Nation\" in August 1925.\n\nBy 1926, Bryant, who had generally abstained from alcohol earlier in life, was suffering from painful and incurable adiposis dolorosa (Dercum's disease) and was drinking heavily. Bullitt, citing his wife's drinking and alleging that she was involved in a lesbian relationship with English painter and sculptor Gwen Le Gallienne, a stepdaughter of writer Richard Le Gallienne, divorced Bryant in 1930 and won sole custody of Anne. Bryant remained in Paris, occasionally advising writer Claude McKay, and briefly assisting researchers from Harvard University in preserving Reed's papers.\n\nBryant died on January 6, 1936, of a brain hemorrhage in Sèvres, in the suburbs of Paris, and is buried in Cimetière des Gonards in Versailles. In 1998, three volunteers from the Oregon Cultural Heritage Commission went to Paris to find the grave, which they discovered was crumbling, undated, and scheduled for removal. Through the commission's efforts as well as donations, including some from relatives of Bryant and Bullitt, the grave was restored.\n\nThe Bryant–Reed story is told in the 1981 film \"Reds\", starring Diane Keaton as Bryant and Warren Beatty as Reed. Supporting actors include Jack Nicholson as Eugene O'Neill, Maureen Stapleton as Emma Goldman, Jerzy Kosiński as Grigory Zinoviev (one of the Bolshevik leaders), and Edward Herrmann as Max Eastman.\n\nBryant's personal papers were transferred to Bullitt, with whom they remained until their daughter, Anne, donated the collection to Yale University in 2004. They exist as separate collections, the Louise Bryant Papers (MS 1840) and the William C. Bullitt Papers (MS 112) in the Sterling Memorial Library at Yale. The Louise Bryant Papers consists of about 19 linear feet (5.8 m) of letters, texts, photographs, art, and other materials that she created or collected between 1916 and 1936.\n\nBryant's early journalistic work appeared in college publications and in newspapers—\"The Spectator\", where Bryant was society editor, and \"The Oregonian\", for whom she freelanced—in Portland.

It was founded in 1983, and is based in Langley, British Columbia.\n\nThe group's stated aim is to \"encourage and strengthen the Canadian family through education and resources based on Christian principles\".\n\nFocus on the Family Canada is operated and directed independently of Focus on the Family USA. However, some ties do exist between the two organizations. Between 2000 and 2003, the Canadian affiliate received $1.6 million in services from the larger American organization. Jim Daly, President and CEO of Focus on the Family in the United States serves on the board of directors of Focus on the Family Canada. Other than receiving financial support from Focus on the Family USA between 2000 and 2003, Focus on the Family Canada relies fully on donor support for its operations.\n\nThe primary focus of the organization is to provide encouragement and resources to Canadian families. Resources include a Canada-wide radio broadcast, magazines for all age groups, free counselling and counselling referrals, marriage and parenting seminars, and books. Focus on the Family Canada's ministry covers issues ranging from parenting children with disabilities to money and time management to dealing with conflict in marriage and infidelity.\n\nFocus on the Family Canada also provides care and support services for pastors, ministry leaders and their families in the form of retreats, pastors' events, and the Clergy Care Network website. In 2008, Focus Canada began the Kerith Creek ministry retreats for married couples and ministry leaders near Calgary, Alberta.\n\nIn the fall of 2009, Focus on the Family Canada launched a parenting website called \"Kids of Integrity: Tools for Growing Godly Character.\" The website provides over 20 lesson plans intended to help parents, grandparents, caregivers and others develop positive character traits in children - traits such as honesty, generosity, respect and self-control. The lessons are designed to engage children ages three to ten and can be downloaded from the Kids of Integrity website free of charge.\n\nAlso in 2009, the organization announced plans to erect its own building under the fundraising campaign called \"Building Families, Building Hope\":\n\nWe feel that God is leading us to establish a permanent home that will allow greater opportunities to share His blessing with Canadian families. Not only will this home serve as the cornerstone of the ministry for years to come, but it will also save as much as $400,000 annually in rent, which we will use to reach even more families with practical advice and Biblical truths.\n\nThe organization has funded efforts in the courts and in its media broadcasts to help \"preserve traditional values and the institution of the family.\" It is opposed to same-sex marriage, LGBT adoption (and LGBT rights in general), abortion, pornography and premarital sex. Focus on the Family promotes child discipline and supports the continued legality of spanking as a form of discipline for children.\n\nFocus on the Family Canada has also established the Institute of Marriage and Family Canada/Institut du Mariage et de la Famille Canada (IMFC). The IMFC is located in Ottawa, Ontario, near Parliament Hill, where the staff conduct and compile social policy research from Canada and around the world. The IMFC's mission is \"to positively influence public opinion and promote public policy that values human life, the pre-eminence of marriage and the institution of the family.\" Its involvement in social issues is not limited to activism, as it has intervened in court cases such as one case in 1999 where it supported denying same-sex couples the right to apply for alimony from one another. The organization had intervenor status in the precedent setting case of \"Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law v. Canada (Attorney General)\", in which the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the legality of child spanking in Canada.\n\nIn addition, the organization publishes \"Today's Family News\", a monthly e-newsletter that provides family-related news stories, research and analysis making headlines across Canada.\n\nPresidents of the organization include: Bruce Gordon (?–1998), one time Deputy Chief of Staff to PM Harper, Darrel Reid (1998–2004), Terence Rolston (2004–present).\n\nA former member of the board of directors of Focus on the Family Canada is Sharon Hayes, who from 1993 to 1997 was a Member of Parliament belonging to the Reform Party of Canada.\n"}

Westover (July 23, 1883 – September 21, 1938) was a major general and fourth chief of the United States Army Air Corps.\n\nWestover was born in Bay City, Michigan, and enlisted in the United States Army when he was 18. He began his service as a private in 1901 before being appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point. He graduated from there in 1906, ranked 43rd in his class, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 14th Infantry. Westover was promoted to first lieutenant on April 13, 1911; to captain on July 1, 1916; and brevetted to major on October 20, 1917.\n\nIn 1919, Lieutenant Colonel Westover was detailed to the United States Army Air Service to serve as Assistant Executive Officer for Director Major General Charles Menoher, where he butted heads with Billy Mitchell over subordination to authority, and on July 1, 1920, transferred permanently to the new Air Service branch with the rank of major. Westover served as Assistant Executive and Executive in the Office of the Chief of the Air Service (OCAS), from November 1918 to November 1920. He was appointed director of aircraft production in April 1921, serving until December 1922.\n\nWestover attended the Air Service Balloon School in 1921, and the Air Service Airship School in 1922. He continued on to heavier-than-air flight training, completing the Air Service Primary Flying School at Brooks Field and the Advanced Flying School at Kelly Field in 1923 at the age of forty. As a result of these courses, Westover was awarded aeronautical ratings as a balloon observer, airship pilot, airplane pilot, and airplane observer, at that time every rating authorized by the Air Service.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1926 he was assigned as commanding officer of Langley Field, Virginia, who was also the commandant of the Air Service Tactical School (which became the Air Corps Tactical School in 1926). He then completed the ACTS course himself in 1927. On January 13, 1930 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and on December 22, 1931 appointed assistant to the chief of the Air Corps with temporary promotion to brigadier general. In 1932 he attended the Command and General Staff College and remained there for a stint as an instructor. On December 22, 1935, he succeeded Benjamin Foulois as Chief of the Air Corps with the accompanying promotion to major general.\n\nThe Army had in 1935 had activated an operational air formation called \"General Headquarters Air Force\" containing 3 of 5 existing combat wings, 9 of 15 existing combat groups, and 30 of 60 existing combat squadrons. This was not the General Headquarters of the Air Force, but was rather the Air Force of the then constituted, but not activated, General Headquarters—the planned command element for a theater of operation on mobilization in war. GHQ Air Force, activated with about 8000 soldiers was considered the equivalent of an infantry or cavalry division and was accordingly commanded by a major general. The wing commanders in GHQ Air Force went from lieutenant colonels or majors to brigadier generals or colonels at this time and corresponded with infantry or cavalry brigade commanders. The Chief of Air Corps was a branch head on par with the chiefs of Infantry, Cavalry, Field Artillery, Coast Artillery, the Corps of Engineers, the Quartermaster Corps, the Ordnance Corps, the Medical Department, the Signal Corps, Military Intelligence, and others who were tasked with manning, training, and equipping specific combat and service units as decided upon by the Army's General Staff and that had been provided to an operational commander of which there were 14 at the time—9 corps areas in the Continental United States (which in 1921 had replaced the Department as the basic command level in the Army since the War of 1812) and 4 overseas departments (Philippines, Hawaii, Canal Zone, and Puerto Rico). None of the branch chiefs had operational control of units dedicated to the combat organizations of the Army. What units they did command were what was needed to train personnel. The relationship between the Chief of the Air Corps and Commanding General of GHQ Air Force was analogous to the Chief of Cavalry and Commanding General of 1st Cavalry Division. The one manned, trained, and equipped specific units as assigned by the War Department General Staff and which were in operational formations and the other employed the aggregate formation and trained it into a warfighting formation. Both the Chief of Air Corps and the Commanding General of GHQ Air Force reported to the Army Chief of Staff, albeit through different General Staff reporting channels.\n\nGHQ Air Force was commanded by Major General Frank M. Andrews, a classmate of Westover's who had finished one place higher in class standings. Aviation advocates looking to the Royal Air Force and its independent status from the British Army and the Royal Navy, saw this \"dual authority\" within aviation as the primary cause many problems in unity of command, particularly since Andrews was outspoken in his advocacy of independence for the Air Corps from the Army. He and Westover clashed often over philosophical differences on this issue, Westover believed that being integrated with the rest of the Army was the priority, as had Westover with Billy Mitchell.\n\nWestover died, aged 55, in a plane crash on September 21, 1938. The Northrop A-17AS he flew, a single-engined attack aircraft used as a high-speed staff transport, had a reputation for stalling, and only a year before Colonel William McChord had been killed in the crash of one. Westover's aircraft, AC serial \"36-349\", experienced a high-speed stall and crashed in a crosswind short of the runway at Lockheed Aircraft's air field in Burbank, California, now known as Bob Hope Airport. The plane crashed in the front yard of a house at 1007 Scott Road in Burbank. No one on the ground was killed, but two homes were damaged by the ensuing flames. His passenger, crew chief S/Sgt Samuel Hymes, also died.\nWestover was succeeded by the Assistant Chief of Air Corps, Brigadier General Henry H. Arnold on September 29.\n\nOscar Westover is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Westover Joint Air Reserve Base in Chicopee, Massachusetts, formerly Westover Air Force Base and the headquarters of the Eighth Air Force, and now the largest reserve base in the Air Force as home to the 439th Airlift Wing, is named in his honor.\n\n"}

{"id": "1949602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949602", "title": "Northcott Theatre", "text": "Northcott Theatre\n\nThe Northcott Theatre is a theatre situated on the Streatham Campus of the University of Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England. It opened in 1967 and was run until 2010 by the Northcott Theatre Foundation, when the company ceased operating after a period in administration. The theatre is now known as Exeter Northcott Theatre and became a registered charity (no. 1151620) in June 2013.\n\nThe Northcott is the seventh building in Exeter to be used as a theatre.\n\nIn 1962, the Theatre Royal, Exeter, was demolished to be replaced by an office block; however, there were many people in Exeter who were determined that the city should not be without a theatre for very long. Early in 1962, Mr George Vernon Northcott (1891-1963) had started negotiations with the board of directors of the Theatre Royal with the view to \"saving\" the theatre, and its re-creation as a theatre and arts centre. A small group from the University of Exeter prepared a memorandum explaining how they saw the Theatre Royal functioning in the kind of way that Mr Northcott visualised and outlining some ideas. They submitted this memorandum to the board of directors of the Theatre Royal and to Mr Northcott. After some time, however, negotiations failed to develop and the Theatre Royal was sold.\n\nFor a time, informal discussions continued between Mr Northcott and the university, and later in 1962 more formal contacts were made. The then vice-chancellor, Sir James Cook, pointed out that the university had for some time earmarked a site for a theatre on its development plan and it was possible that, in collaboration with the university, Mr Northcott's ideas for a theatre and arts centre could be realised.\n\nUltimately, the university offered a site: Mr Northcott established a trust with a benefaction of £100,000 (later supplemented by a generous gift of £50,000 from the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and by other bodies), to establish the \"Northcott Devon Theatre and Arts Centre\", which would serve the needs of the community in the region. The Northcott Theatre opened with a production of \"The Merchant of Venice\", starring Tony Church, its first Artistic Director, on 2 November 1967. Barbara Hepworth unveiled one of her sculptures in the foyer on opening night. The architects were Sir William Holford and Partners and the theatre consultant Michael Warre.\n\nActors who spent time in the Northcott company in their earlier careers include Polly James, Lesley Joseph, John Nettles, Robert Lindsay, Brian Protheroe, Bob Peck, Geraldine James, Paul Jesson, Joanna Tope, Caroline John, Celia Imrie, Nick Brimble and Imelda Staunton; and Nicholas Hytner professionally directed his first straight dramas here. In its first years, the company originated a number of plays of West Country interest, including new historical drama by Jack Emery and an adaptation of the Cornish Mystery Play Cycle. It also toured productions throughout the area.\n\nThe Northcott has a strong history as a producing repertory theatre, that is to say the bulk of its historical productions were staged by the company itself, rather than being brought in from elsewhere.\nAs built the theatre was given a semicircular main house auditorium seating 433 people with an orchestra pit on a mechanical lift; being also configurable as theatre in the round or cinema. The capacity of the venue was increased in the 2007 refurbishment and it can now seat 464.\n\nIn March 2005, the directors of the Northcott announced that planning permission and funding would be sought for a £3.1 million building project to expand front of house facilities and increase the capacity of the auditorium to 538 seats.\n\nHaving raised £2.1 million, the theatre was closed for refurbishment in January 2007 and reopened on 12 December 2007, near the fortieth anniversary of its first opening.\n\nThe refurbishment provided the following;\n\nThe day before the rebranded Exeter Northcott reopened in December 2007, Arts Council England threatened withdrawal of its entire £547,000 annual grant. The loss of a third of the theatre's operating costs would result in a drastic cutback in production and job losses, if the theatre even managed to stay open. However, on 1 February 2008 the Arts Council England announced a reprieve for the Exeter Northcott and its continued funding.\n\nFollowing the discovery of a legacy of accounting problems inherited from the previous management, the trustees placed the theatre into administration on 25 February 2010. This decision was opposed by Arts Council England which had earlier sent in a forensic accountant to investigate the extent of the problem. These investigations had not yet been completed. Geoff Myers, chairman of the theatre's trustees, said: \"We took this decision with a heavy heart but when presented with the latest financial information we had no choice but to place the theatre into administration. It is to be hoped that a way can be found to effect a rescue of the theatre.\" Exeter City Council and the university have agreed to help find a way to save the theatre. On 5 June 2010 it was confirmed by administrators Begbies Traynor that a new company set up by the university had purchased the theatre, the Exeter Northcott Theatre Company, and the immediate future of the theatre was thought to have been secured. In September 2014 Exeter Northcott Theatre announced a new major sponsorship agreement with law firm Browne Jacobson. In 2015, under Artistic and Executive Director Paul Jepson, the theatre returned to producing its own work with A Christmas Carol followed by Betrayal, by Harold Pinter, in 2016. In 2017, the theatre made a return to producing its own pantomime with Dick Whittington, directed by Tony Lidington In January 2018 a performance exploring epilepsy and created by the theatre in collaboration with the University of Exeter, Beyond My Control, went on a national tour\n\n\"List formerly published on the Northcott Theatre website\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

The outnumbered Venetian Armada Grossa, under the \"Capitano Straordinario delle Navi\" Lodovico Flangini, proved herself able to match a superior Turkish force under the \"Kapudan Pasha\" Hodja Ibrahim Pasha in a manoeuvred fight that lasted nearly ten days. The outcome of this tough battle was unclear, since both fleet retired to their bases badly damaged, after Flangini died of wounds on the 22nd.\n\nThe Venetians had left Corfu on 10 May 1717 with 25 battleships, hoping to intercept the Ottomans still inside the Dardanelles. After reaching the island of Zante, their fleet was joined on 18 May by \"Gloria Veneta\". On 26 May the Armada Grossa left Zante with eighteen transport ships, sailing towards the Dardanelles Strait, and on 8 June dropped anchors south of Imbros. From here, two corvettes were sent towards the Straits, where they found that the Ottoman fleet was composed of 34 battleships and 6 berbery ships.\n\nOn 10 June at 9am the scouts reported that the Ottoman fleet were leaving the Dardanelles with 38 battleships and 6 galliots. Strong winds damaged some Venetian ships and forced them to remain at anchors. It was impossible to weather Imbros, so Flangini formed a line on the starboard tack heading toward Thasos. In the meantime the Ottoman fleet had anchored just outside the Dardanelles.\n\nFor two days Flangini tried to reach a favorable position, but the strong adverse winds forced him to give up and anchor in lee of Imbros at about 12pm on 12 June. The wind then suddenly turned ENE, in favour of the Ottomans, who promptly set sails. Because of the current, they reached the Venetians before there was time to form a correct line and Flangini signalled to form up in any order. At 3:30pm fighting began in the Rear with 8 Ottoman ships attacking \"Colomba\", \"Trionfo\", flagship of Flangini's second in command, the \"Capitano delle Navi\" Marcantonio Diedo, and \"San Lorenzo\".\n\nAt 4:30pm, the Ottoman fleet divided into two divisions, the first, with lighter ships, sailed towards the Venetians rear, while the other, under Kapudan Pasha Hodja Ibrahim Pasha, headed to the vanguard. Shortly after, \"Colomba\" was hit twice below the waterline and, leaking badly, was forced to leave the line. After further fighting, by about 9pm the Ottoman ships retreated, when one of their fireships was sunk trying to set afire \"Trionfo\". In the vanguard, the Venetians had formed a good line of 1st-rates: at about 6pm these were attacked by the main group of Ottoman ships, and the fighting last till about 9pm. That night the damaged Venetians sailed westward. German troops aboard the heavy damaged \"Colomba\" nearly mutinied and were transferred on the \"San Gaetano\". Venetian so far suffered 183 deads and 394 wounded, of which 98 aboard the \"Trionfo\"; Captain Damian Pendesich of the \"Terror\" was killed, and Iseppo Caenazzo, flag captain of Marcantonio Diedo on the \"Trionfo\", had been seriously wounded. According to the despatches sent by Flangini and Diedo, the Venetian fleet suffered damage to some sails and unimportant spars, while a manuscript account spoke of four top mizzen masts lost, several upper-deck guns dismounted on the \"Leon Trionfante\" and the fore topmast lost on the \"San Pietro\".\n\nOn 13 June the Venetians were near the western end of Lemnos, with the Ottoman fleet to the north. Flangini formed a line on the starboard tack. \"Colomba\" was to leeward, its place taken by \"Corona\". Towards evening the Ottoman fleet sailed before a north wind and nearly cut off \"Trionfo\" and \"San Lorenzo\", which had dropped back. Flangini turned to support his second in command, and at the same time the wind turned to the west, putting him to windward. With the loss of the wind gauge, the Ottomans retired after only two of their ships had opened fire, and disappeared in the darkness.\n\nAt daybreak on the 14th, the Venetians, having kept on the starboard tack with the wind blowing NNW, were between Lemnos and Mount Athos, with the Ottoman fleet to windwards. Flangini held on sailing westward, while the Ottoman fleet turned and stood towards the island of Lemnos.\n\nOn 15 June the Venetians were becalmed between Mount Athos and Strati. They sailed north slightly in an attempt to get the wind gauge, but on 16 June the Ottoman fleet appeared to windward (NE). Flangini tried to form a NNW line but some ships couldn't keep station and he formed an ESE line instead. At about 9am fighting began in the Van and included all of the line in about 30 minutes. Flangini, hit at midday by a musket ball in the neck, fell unconscious and was at first believed dead, just as the nearly dismasted flagship of Hodja Ibrahim Pasha was towed out of the battle line by two galiots. At 2:30 pm, after 5 hours of fighting, the Ottoman fleet withdrew towards Lemnos with 6 ships more or less dismasted and the Venetians, left without orders, lost an opportunity of going about and getting the wind gauge, and instead retired to Thermia. The Venetian fleet lost this day 261 killed and 543 wounded: Flangini's flagship, the \"Leon Trionfante\", lost 87 killed and wounded, and her next astern, the \"Madonna dell'Arsenal\", 109. Flangini's despatch of 21 June accounted for 833 casualties, making about 1390 casualties for the whole battle.\n\nThe following day, the Venetian fleet lay becalmed, and on the 18th Flangini recovered well enough – or Diedo ultimately took command, the situation is unclear – to set sail for repairs at Skyros or Andros, but the wind that blew hard from north made the weather so bad that it was not possible to bring up before reaching Thermia, south of Negropont, in the evening of 19 June. On the 22nd the Venetian fleet was disturbed by seven Ottoman ships, that attacked the scouts. Flangini, who asked to be brought on his ship's deck to direct the operation even in his dire condition, weighted anchors and formed a battle line, forcing the Ottomans to withdraw. Exhausted by those last efforts, Flangini died later that day, and Diedo succeeded him.\nThe Rear Admiral assessed that his fleet needed to be reinforced before he could successfully re-engage the Ottomans. As a result, he retired to the south of Morea, where he hoped to find his superior in command, the \"Capitano Generale da Mar\" Andrea Pisani.\n\nDiedo brought the fleet to Marathonisi, north to Cape Matapan, where he dropped anchors on 28 June. There he was joined, on 1 July, by the vessel \"Fortuna Guerriera\" and the allied squadron of seven Portuguese and two Maltese ships under the pontifical General Lieutenant Chevalier de Bellefontaine. Pisani also arrived with the \"Armada Sottile\" (the galley fleet) on the 12th. This situation evolved in the following Battle of Matapan.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1949634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949634", "title": "Astures", "text": "Astures\n\nThe Astures or Asturs, also named Astyrs, were the Hispano-Celtic inhabitants of the northwest area of Hispania that now comprises almost the entire modern autonomous community of Principality of Asturias, the modern province of León, and the northern part of the modern province of Zamora (all in Spain), and eastern Trás os Montes in Portugal. They were a horse-riding highland cattle-raising people who lived in circular huts of stone drywall construction. The Albiones were a major tribe from western Asturias. Isidore of Seville gave an etymology as coming from a \"river Asturia\", identified by David Magie with Órbigo river in the plain of León, by others the modern Esla river.\n\nThe Asturian homeland encompassed the modern autonomous community of Asturias and the León, eastern Lugo, Orense, and northern Zamora provinces, along with the northeastern tip of the Portuguese region of Trás-os-Montes. Here they held the towns of \"Lancia\" (Villasabariego – León), \"Asturica\" (Astorga – León), \"Mons Medullius\" (Las Medulas? – León), \"Bergidum\" (Cacabelos, near Villafranca del Bierzo – León), \"Bedunia\" (Castro de Cebrones – León), \"Aliga\" (Alixa? – León), \"Curunda\" (Castro de Avelãs, Trás-os-Montes), \"Lucus Asturum\" (Lugo de Llanera – Asturias), \"Brigaetium\" (Benavente – Zamora), and \"Nemetobriga\" (A Pobra de Trives – Ourense), which was the religious center.\n\nThe Astures may have been part of the early Hallstatt expansion that left the Bavarian-Bohemian homeland and migrated into Gaul, some continuing over the mountains into Spain and Portugal. By the 6th century BC, they occupied castros (hillforts), such as Coanna and Mohias near Navia on the coast of the Bay of Biscay. From the Roman point-of-view, expressed in the brief remarks of the historians Florus, epitomising Livy, and Orosius , the Astures were divided into two factions, following the natural division made by the alpine karst mountains of the Picos de Europa range: the \"Transmontani\" (located in the modern Asturias, \"beyond\"— that is, north of— the Picos de Europa) and \"Cismontani\" (located on the \"near\" side, in the modern area of León). The Transmontani, placed between the Navia River and the central massif of the Picos de Europa, comprised the Cabarci, Iburri, Luggones, Paesici, Paenii, Saelini, Vinciani, Viromenici, Brigaentini and Baedunienses; the Cismontani included the Amaci, Cabruagenigi, Lancienses, Lougei, Tiburi, Orniaci, Superatii, Gigurri, Zoelae and Susarri (which dwelled around Asturica Augusta, in the \"Astura\" river valley, and was the main Astur town in Roman times). Prior to the Roman conquest in the late 1st century BC, they were united into a tribal federation with the mountain-top citadel of \"Asturica\" (Astorga) as their capital.\n\nRecent epigraphic studies suggest that they spoke a ‘Q-Celtic’ language akin to the neighbouring Gallaeci Lucenses and Braccarenses (see Gallaecia). Although the Celtic language was lost during the Low Middle Ages it still endures in many names of villages and geographical features, mostly associated to Celtic deities: the parish of Taranes and the villages of Tereñes, Táranu, Tarañu and Torañu related to the god Taranis, the parish of Lugones related to the god Lugus or the parish of Beleño related to the god Belenus, just to name a few.\n\nAccording to classic authors, their family structure was matrilineal, whereby the woman inherits the ownership of property.\nThe Astures lived in hill forts, established in strategic areas and built with round walls in today's Asturias and the mountainous areas of León, and with rectangular walls in flatter areas, similarly to their fellow Galicians. Their warrior class consisted of men and women and both sexes were considered fierce fighters.\n\nMost of their tribes, like the Lugones, worshipped the Celtic god Lugh, and references to other Celtic deities like Taranis or Belenos still remain in the toponomy of the places inhabited by the Astures. They may have venerated the deity Busgosu.\n\nThe Astures were vigorous hunter-gatherer highlanders who raided Roman outposts in the lowlands; a reputation enhanced by ancient authors, such as Florus (\"\"Duae validissmae gentes, Cantabriae et Astures, immunes imperii agitabant\"\") and Paulus Orosius (\"\"duas fortissimas Hispaniae gentes\"\"), but archeological evidence confirms that they also engaged in stock-raising in mountain pastures, complemented by subsistence farming on the slopes and in the lower valleys. They mostly reared sheep, goats, a few oxen and a local breed of mountain horse famed in Antiquity, the Asturcon, which still exists today. According to Pliny the Elder, these were small-stature saddle horses, slightly larger than ponies, of graceful walk and very fast, being trained for both hunting and mountain warfare.\n\nDuring a large part of the year they used acorns as a staple food source, drying and powdering them and using the flour for a type of easily preserved bread; from their few sown fields that they had during the pre-Roman period, they harvested barley from which they produced beer (\"Zythos\"), as well as wheat and flax. Due to the scarcity of their agricultural production, as well as their strong war-like character, they made frequent incursions into the lands of the Vaccaei, who had a much more developed agriculture. Lucan calls them \"Pale seekers after gold\" (\"\"Asturii scrutator pallidus auri\"\").\n\nThe Astures entered the historical record in the late 3rd century BC, being listed amongst the Iberian Peninsula mercenaries of Hasdrubal Barca’s army at the battle of Metaurus River in 207 BC. Silius also mentions an Astur mercenary contingent in Hannibal's army, led by a chieftain named Cydnus. After the 2nd Punic War, their history is less clear. Rarely mentioned in the sources regarding the Lusitanian, Celtiberian or Roman Civil Wars of the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, they re-emerged from a relative obscurity just prior to the outbreak of the first Astur-Cantabrian war in the late 1st century BC.\n\nLed by the ex-mercenary General Gausón, the Astures joined forces with the Cantabri in an effort to forestall Emperor Augustus’ all-out offensive to conquer the whole of the Iberian northwest, even backing an unsuccessful Vaccaei revolt in 29 BC. The Campaign against the Astures and Cantabri tribes proved so difficult that it required the presence of the emperor himself to bolster the failing courage of the seven legions and one naval squadron involved. The first Roman campaign against the Astures (the \"Bellum Asturicum\"), which commenced in the spring of 26 BC, was successfully concluded in 25 BC with the ceremonial surrender of Mons Medullus to Augustus in person, allowing the latter to return to Rome and ostentatiously close the gates of the temple of Janus that same year. The reduction of the remaining Asture holdouts was entrusted to Publius Carisius, the Legate of Lusitania, who, after managing to trap the Asturian General Gauson and the remnants of his troops at the hillfort of Lancia, subsequently forced them to surrender when he threatened to set fire to the town. The Astures were subdued by the Romans but were never fully conquered, and their tribal way of life changed very little.\n\nAs far as the official Roman history was concerned, the fall of this last redoubt marked the conclusion of the conquest of the Asturian lands, which henceforth were included alongside Gallaecia and Cantabria into the new Transduriana Province. This was followed by the establishment of military garrisons at \"Castra\" \"Legio VII Gemina\" (León) and \"Petavonium\" (Rosinos de Vidriales – Zamora), along with colonies at \"Asturica Augusta\" (Astorga) and \"Lucus Asturum\".\n\nIn spite of the harsh pacification policies implemented by Augustus, the Asturian country remained an unstable region subjected to sporadic revolts – often carried out in collusion with the Cantabri – and persistent guerrilla activity that kept the Roman occupation forces busy until the mid-1st century AD. New risings occurred in 24–22 BC (the 2nd Astur-Cantabrian War), in 20–18 BC (3rd Astur-Cantabrian ‘War’) – sparked off by runaway Cantabrian slaves returning from Gaul – both of which were brutally quashed by General Marcus Vispanius Agrippa and again in 16–13 BC when Augustus crushed the last joint Astur-Cantabrian rebellion.\n\nAggregated to the Hispania Tarraconensis province, the assimilation of the Asturian region into the Roman world was a slow and hazardous process, with its partially romanized people retaining the Celtic language, religion and much of their ancient culture throughout the Roman Imperial period. This included their martial traditions, which enabled them to provide the Roman Army with auxiliary cavalry units (\"Alae\"), who participated in Emperor Claudius' invasion of Britain in AD 43–60. However, epigraphic evidence in the form of an inscribed votive stele dedicated by a \"Primipilus Centurion\" of \"Legio VI Victrix\" decorated for bravery in action confirms that the Astures staged a revolt in AD 54, prompting another vicious guerrilla war – unrecorded by surviving ancient sources – that lasted for fourteen years but the situation was finally calm around AD 68. During the Germanic invasions of the late 4th century AD, they resisted Suevi and Visigoth raids throughout the 5th Century AD, only to be ultimately defeated and absorbed into the Visigothic Kingdom by the Visigothic King Sisebut in the early 6th Century AD. However, the Astures continued to rebel, with King Wamba sending an expedition to the Asturian lands only twenty years before the Muslim invasion of the peninsula and the fall of the Visigothic kingdom. The Astures chose Pelagius of Asturias as their leader and in due course formed the Kingdom of Asturias.\n\nAt a later date, in the beginning of the Reconquista period in the early Middle Ages, their name was preserved in the medieval Kingdom of Asturias and in the modern town of Astorga, León, whose designation still reflects its early Roman name of Asturica Augusta, the \"Augustan settlement of the Astures\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1949688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949688", "title": "Fortuna Düsseldorf", "text": "Fortuna Düsseldorf\n\nFortuna Düsseldorf () is a German football club in Düsseldorf, North Rhine-Westphalia. Founded in 1895, Fortuna entered the league in 1913 and was a fixture in the top flight from the early 1920s up to the creation of the Bundesliga in 1963. 2019–20 is their 25th season in the Bundesliga and the second in a row since getting promoted from the 2. Bundesliga in the 2017–18 season.\n\nThe earliest roots of the association go back to the establishment of the gymnastics club Turnverein Flingern on 5 May 1895 in the village of Flingern, today one of the eastern quarters of Düsseldorf. Two other sides figure in the club's early history: Düsseldorfer Fußballklub Spielverein, founded in 1908, and FK Alemania 1911, which was founded in 1911 and became Fortuna 1911 the following year. In mid-1913, these two clubs merged to form Düsseldorfer Fußball-Club Fortuna 1911 which played its debut season in the Westdeutschen Spielverband in 1913–14. TV Flingern joined Fortuna to create Düsseldorfer Turn- und Sportverein Fortuna on 15 November 1919.\n\nIn the late 1920s, Fortuna won its first honours as a first tier side; it captured a district level Bezirksliga title in 1927, sent its first representative to the Germany national team in 1928 (Ernst Albrecht), and took a second Bezirksliga title in 1929. The team continued to perform well into the 1930s, winning its third and fourth district titles en route to a Western German football championship in 1931 and its greatest success, a German football championship in 1933 against Schalke 04, which was on the verge of becoming the era's dominant side in Germany. Fortuna was the first team to win the title without conceding a goal in the final rounds of the tournament. It beat Vorwärts-Rasensport Gleiwitz (9–0), Arminia Hannover (3–0), Eintracht Frankfurt (4–0) and finally Schalke 04 (3–0) en route to becoming the first national champion from the industrial Rhine-Ruhr area.\n\nIn the following season, the club began playing in Gauliga Niederrhein, 1 of 16 top-flight divisions formed in the re-organization of German football under the Third Reich. Düsseldorf dominated the division through the 1930s as five-time champions between 1936 and 1940, and made losing appearances in the national championship final in 1936 (1–2 to 1. FC Nürnberg) and the final of the Tschammerpokal, the predecessor of today's DFB-Pokal, in 1937 (1–2 against Schalke 04). The club was relegated in 1942 but made a prompt return to the top flight the following season. In 1944–45, it began play as the combined wartime side Kriegsspielgemeinschaft TSV Fortuna/SC 99 Düsseldorf with partner Düsseldorfer Sport Club 1899, but took part in only two matches as Nazi Germany fell before the advance of Allied armies.\n\nThe most notable players of that era were Paul Janes, Germany's most capped player from 1942 to 1970 (71 caps), German team captain (1939–1942) and member of the Breslau Eleven that beat Denmark 8–0 in Breslau in 1937 and went on to win 10 of 11 games played during that year; Stanislaus Kobierski, who earned 26 caps and scored Germany's first ever FIFA World Cup goal; Ernst Albrecht; and Jakob Bender.\n\nAfter World War II, Allied occupation authorities ordered the dissolution of all sports organizations in Germany. Fortuna was re-formed in 1945 and then played most of their football in the Oberliga West (I) in the years between 1947 and the creation of the Bundesliga, Germany's professional football league, in 1963. It played as a lower-to-mid-table side but did earn three appearances in the DFB-Pokal final in – 1957, 1958 and 1962 – but was not able to take the prize, losing each of those matches to Bayern Munich, VfB Stuttgart and 1. FC Nürnberg. It was also during this era that Toni Turek, goalkeeper for Germany's \"Miracle of Bern\" side at the 1954 World Cup; Erich Juskowiak (30 caps and World Cup player in 1958); and later national team coach Jupp Derwall all represented Fortuna.\n\nFortuna's performance was not good enough to earn them a place among the original 16 teams chosen for the newly founded Bundesliga in 1963, but the club did manage to play its way into the premier division three years later for a cameo appearance in 1966–67. Despite a sensational 2–1 away win at recently crowned European Cup Winners' Cup winners Borussia Dortmund in its Bundesliga debut, Fortuna was immediately relegated, though only to return in 1971 for a stay that lasted 16 seasons and included two third-place league finishes (in 1972–73 and 1973–74). On 9 December 1978, Fortuna recorded a 7–1 victory against Bayern Munich, to date the highest away defeat for Bayern in its entire Bundesliga history. In addition, Fortuna continued its prosperous play in the DFB-Pokal, making another three appearances. After losing in its fifth appearance in the final in 1978 against local rivals 1. FC Köln (0–2), the club finally broke through and came away as champions in 1979, prevailing 1–0 against Hertha BSC, then repeating as champions 1980 with 2–1 victory against 1. FC Köln. During this period, the club established a record for consecutive DFB-Pokal match victories, with 18-straight between 1978 and 1981.\n\nFortuna is among a group of four teams which have made frequent appearances in the DFB-Pokal final only to come away empty-handed. Like 1. FC Kaiserslautern, Fortuna has just two wins against fives losses. 1. FC Köln has four wins and six losses in the Cup final, while Schalke 04 has been frustrated most often, with five wins and seven losses. Four of the Düsseldorfer's losses were by a single goal and two of those were in extra time.\n\nThe club's best turn in European competition was in the 1979 European Cup Winners' Cup Final, where it finished as runners-up to Barcelona, losing 4–3 in extra time in an exciting finale at Basel. It was the first of four occasions that the Catalan club won the tournament.\n\nFortuna achieved its success mostly with hometown players like the famous Allofs brothers (Klaus Allofs and Thomas Allofs) or players like Gerd Zewe (440 games in the Bundesliga), Dieter Herzog, Reiner Geye, Wolfgang Seel and Rudi Bommer who joined the team as nearly unknown players and ended as internationals. Between 1960 and 1967, Peter Meyer scored 119 goals in 174 games.\n\nSince its relegation in 1987, Fortuna has bounced back and forth between leagues, spending five more seasons in the Bundesliga in 1989–92 and 1995–97 and slipping as low as Oberliga Nordrhein (IV) in 2002–04. In 2001, the club escaped relegation to tier IV only because two other clubs were denied licenses to play in tier III for financial reasons. Fortuna had its own money problems at the time but have since managed to arrange its finances more or less back into order. Between 2001 and 2003, the club was sponsored by German punk rock band Die Toten Hosen.\n\nIn 2008–09, Fortuna competed in the newly established 3. Liga, finishing second and gaining automatic promotion to the 2. Bundesliga, where it finished fourth in its comeback season, 2009–10. In this season, Fortuna was the only side unbeaten in home-matches in the three top German (nationwide) leagues.\n\nAfter a promising 2009–10 season, the 2010–11 season began poorly for Fortuna. After the first six games of the season, the club was in last place, having lost every match. During these first six matches, the club managed to score only two goals – one of which was an own-goal by the other side. Despite this discouraging start, Fortuna bounced back and finished the season in seventh place. 2011–12 began very differently: after the first half of the season, Fortuna was in first place in the table with a remarkable record of 12 wins, 5 draws and 0 losses. The \"Herbstmeister\" title gave the team and the fans hope that this could be the year Fortuna returned to the Bundesliga. The second half of the season was more challenging, as Fortuna was unable to maintain its pace: it suffered four losses and a number of draws, slipping to third place in the final standings. Nonetheless, this was sufficient for them to qualify for the two-game relegation playoff against the third-last place team in the Bundesliga – Hertha BSC. The first game of the relegation was played on 10 May 2012 in Berlin, with Fortuna winning 2–1. Fortuna drew the deciding game which was played on 15 May in Düsseldorf. Hertha fans, however, threw firecrackers at the field and the players, and one minute before the match ended, overexcited Fortuna fans stormed the field.\n\nThe promotion to the Bundesliga represented an extraordinary personal achievement for team captain Andreas Lambertz, as he became the first player in German football history to be promoted three times with the same club, from the then fourth-tier Oberliga to the Bundesliga. For striker Sascha Rösler, it marked the fourth time in his career that he was promoted from the Second Division into the Bundesliga.\n\nComing with the recent promotion, the club achieved a new record in German football history, becoming the only German club that has been relegated from the Bundesliga down to a fourth-tier league (time period of downfall: 1997–2002) and promoted back to the Bundesliga afterwards (time period of uprising: 2004–2012).\n\nFortuna started the 2012–13 Bundesliga season strongly: after five games, it was in fifth place in the table and concerns about relegation seemed to have been put to rest. However, Fortuna's 1–0 home win over SpVgg Greuther Fürth on 16 February would prove to be the club's final victory of the season. The season concluded with Fortuna playing in Hannover 96, a match Fortuna lost 0–3. This defeat, combined with an FC Augsburg win over Greuther Fürth and a bizarre and unlikely victory by 1899 Hoffenheim over second-place Borussia Dortmund, resulted in Fortuna dropping two places. \"Fortuna\" finished 17th and were again relegated back to the 2. Bundesliga.\n\nFortuna's relegation was the result not only of this unlikely series of occurrences on the final day of the season, but also a poor conclusion to the year. Of its final eight matches, it did not win a single one; just one win would have secured its position for the following season's Bundesliga. This poor performance contributed to the dismissal of head coach Norbert Meier.\n\nRelegation to the 2. Bundesliga led to a period of generally disappointing performance. Fortuna spent the years between 2013 and 2017 in the middle of the table, often battling against relegation and rarely challenging for promotion back to the Bundesliga. During these years, the club went through a series of coaching changes, with Oliver Reck, Frank Kramer, and former player Mike Buskens among others leading the club at various points. Success however remained elusive.\n\nIn March 2016, Friedhelm Funkel – a native of Neuss – took over as coach of Fortuna Düsseldorf. In his first game as coach, Funkel led the club to a 4–3 win against 1. FC Kaiserslautern, ending a month-long winless streak. Funkel's start as coach marked the beginning of a period of increased stability and success for Fortuna.\n\nAt the start of the 2017–18 season, two of Fortuna's strongest performers from the previous year, goalkeeper Michael Rensing and forward Ihlas Bebou, were both lost from the club with Rensing suffering two broken ribs and Bebou transferring to Bundesliga side Hannover 96. A further setback was that Funkel's assistant Peter Hermann asked to be released from his contract with Fortuna in order to rejoin his mentor Jupp Heynckes upon his return to FC Bayern. With these three losses, it appeared that the 2017–18 season could be difficult for Fortuna. However, the club started extremely strongly: on the fourth day of the season, Fortuna had climbed to first place in the table, with a draw and three wins. For the remainder of the year, they would not drop below third place, benefiting from particularly strong play by Rensing's replacement in goal, Raphael Wolf, newly-acquired Belgian forward Benito Raman, striker Rouwen Hennings, and midfielder Florian Neuhaus. A late-season slump saw Fortuna lose three games in succession in early April, but Fortuna won their next two matches, securing promotion to the Bundesliga. In the final game of the season, with promotion already secured, Fortuna defeated 1. FC Nürnberg 3:2 on a last-minute goal thereby securing first place and the 2. Division Championship. For coach Friedhelm Funkel, this marks the sixth time he had led a club to promotion—a German record.\n\nFortuna Düsseldorf's return to first-division football in 2018–19 was greeted with great enthusiasm by their supporters. The first half of the season was marked by strong but inconsistent play. Fortuna played remarkably well against top Bundesliga sides, taking a point from Leipzig and defeating Hoffenheim and first-place Borussia Dortmund. Most encouraging was an away draw against the defending champions Bayern Munich, when Fortuna came back after trailing 2–0 and 3–1, to secure a 3–3 draw in the 93rd minute, with Dodi Lukebakio scored all three of Fortuna's goals. However, Fortuna failed to play with the same consistency and decisiveness against clubs lower in the table, against whom they will battle to avoid relegation, losing to Augsburg, Nürnberg and Mainz, and only managing a draw against Stuttgart.<ref name=\"Termine18/19\"></ref> Fortuna Düsseldorf entered the mid-winter break in 14th place in the table, concluding the first half of the season with three successive wins against Freiburg, Dortmund and Hannover. Fortuna Düsseldorf enjoyed a more consistent second half of the season, with away wins over Augsburg, Hertha Berlin and one of their best performances in recent times, a storming display in a 0-4 win at Schalke 04. A 4-1 win at home to Werder Bremen and a 3-1 victory over Borussia Mönchengladbach were highlights at home, whilst other home wins over VfB Stuttgart, Nürnberg and a final day defeat of Hannover 96 ensured a 10th place finish in the Bundesliga. This achieved Fortuna Düsseldorf’s highest league finish since the 1989-90 Bundesliga season, where they finished 9th.\n\nFor the 2017–18 season, online sports betting website Tipbet renewed its agreement as Premium Partners of Fortuna. The deal involves marketing campaigns to raise brand awareness, while regular promotions are organised.\n\nThe club's honours are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwenty-five \"Fortuna\" players have made appearances with the national side earning 240 caps between them. With the exception of Erich Juskowiak, all players debuted as Fortuna players:\n\n\n\nFortuna's fiercest rivalry is with 1. FC Köln, which stems from the geographic proximity of Düsseldorf and Cologne as well as the historic rivalry between the two cities. However, in recent seasons the clubs have rarely played in the same division making head-to-head encounters increasingly rare. The 2013–14 season marked the last time the two clubs met in competitive matches when both played in the Second Division. For the 2018–19 season, Fortuna was promoted to the 1. Bundesliga precisely as 1. FC Köln was demoted from the Bundesliga to the Second Division, again avoiding the “Rheinland Derby”.\n\nFortuna’s other historic rivals are Rot-Weiss Essen, Bayer 04 Leverkusen, and Wuppertaler SV. During the 1970s, all four clubs played in the Bundesliga. Both Essen and Wuppertal have since dropped to lower leagues. Bayer Leverkusen, on the other hand, has emerged as a powerful force in the Bundesliga. Leverkusen’s financial support from the Bayer chemical conglomerate has led to many Düsseldorf fans criticizing the club as “plastic” and inauthentic, without any real tradition. During the seasons when they both played in the Second Division, Fortuna’s matches against MSV Duisburg and Borussia Mönchengladbach were hotly contested and were often referred to as “Lower Rhein Derbys”. Fortuna Düsseldorf and Rot-Weiss Essen have played one another 59 times and many fans still regard this as a heated rivalry, but direct matches have been rare in recent years. Fortuna also has inter-city rivalries with Düsseldorf SC99 and TuRU Düsseldorf, yet these have also lost their intensity. During the post-war years, no other club within the Düsseldorf city limits has ever played in a higher division than Fortuna.\n\nBecause of the dominance of FC Bayern München in recent decades, Fortuna also has a competitive rivalry with the Bavarians. Although Düsseldorf has not mounted a serious challenge for the Bundesliga championship since the early 1970s, matches between Fortuna and FC Bayern have been fiercely contested. In a 1975 match, Bayern led at halftime 4:2, but Fortuna came back to win 6:5. On 9 December 1978, Fortuna defeated FC Bayern 7:1, an outcome which to this day remains FC Bayern’s worst-ever away loss. During the 1985–86 season, Fortuna was the only team to win both of its games against the eventual champions from Munich, winning 4:0 and 3:2. \nThe band Die Toten Hosen, many of whose members are enthusiastic fans of Fortuna Düsseldorf, have celebrated the team's success against FC Bayern in their song \"Bayern\" which appears on their album \"Immortal\".\nThe last Bundesliga game was a draw after Munich had led 3–1. Fortuna scored two goals, 3: 3 in 10 minutes.\n\nThe club has a particular strong affiliation with English League One side Ipswich Town, with their supporters making annual visits to see them at their home ground, Portman Road, since 2003. Ipswich fans have also done the same, with some coming to cheer Dusseldorf on at the Merkur Spiel-Arena.\n\nFortuna Düsseldorf enjoys a strong a spirited fan base, and supporters in the \"ultra\" curve of the stadium are well known for their elaborate choreographed displays and enthusiastic support for their club, which occasionally includes the lighting of “Bengalos” or fireworks in the stands.\n\nMembers of the band Die Toten Hosen, including lead singer Campino, are often present at Fortuna matches at home and on the road, and when Fortuna celebrated its recent 2. Division championship in front of thousands of fans at Düsseldorf's city hall on 14 May 2018, the band appeared with them. The band is also highly regarded by the club for serving as sponsors during the 2001–02 and 2002–03 seasons, when the club had been relegated to the Regional League and faced financial difficulty.\n"}

The distinction between an accessory and a principal is a question of fact and degree:\n\nIn some jurisdictions, an accessory is distinguished from an accomplice, who normally is present at the crime and participates in some way. An accessory must generally have knowledge that a crime is being committed, will be committed, or has been committed. A person with such knowledge may become an accessory by helping or encouraging the criminal in some way. The assistance to the criminal may be of any type, including emotional or financial assistance as well as physical assistance or concealment.\n\nThe punishment tariff for accessories varies in different jurisdictions, and has varied at different periods of history. In some times and places accessories have been subject to lesser penalties than \"principals\" (the persons who actually commit the crime). In others accessories are considered the same as principals in theory, although in a particular case an accessory may be treated less severely than a principal. In some times and places accessories before the fact (i.e., with knowledge of the crime before it is committed) have been treated differently from accessories after the fact (e.g., those who aid a principal after a crime has been committed, but had no role in the crime itself). Common law traditionally considers an accessory just as guilty as the principal(s) in a crime, and subject to the same penalties. Separate and lesser punishments exist by statute in many jurisdictions.\n\nIn some situations, a charge of conspiracy can be made even if the primary offense is never committed, so long as the plan has been made, and at least one \"overt act\" towards the crime has been committed by at least one of the conspirators. For example, if a group plans on forging bank checks, and forges the checks but ultimately does not attempt to cash the checks, the group might still be charged with conspiracy due to the overt act of forgery. Thus, an accessory before the fact will often, but not always, also be considered a conspirator. A conspirator must have been a party to the planning of the crime, rather than merely becoming aware of the plan to commit it and then helping in some way.\n\nA person who incites another to a crime will become a part of a conspiracy if agreement is reached, and may then be considered an accessory or a joint principal if the crime is eventually committed. \n\nIn the United States, a person who learns of the crime and gives some form of assistance before the crime is committed is known as an \"accessory before the fact\". A person who learns of the crime after it is committed and helps the criminal to conceal it, or aids the criminal in escaping, or simply fails to report the crime, is known as an \"accessory after the fact\". A person who does both is sometimes referred to as an \"accessory before and after the fact\", but this usage is less common.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, criminal \"facilitation\" laws do not require that the primary crime be actually committed as a prerequisite for criminal liability. These include state statutes making it a crime to \"provide\" a person with \"means or opportunity\" to commit a crime, \"believing it probable that he/she is rendering aid to a person who intends to commit a crime.\"\n\nTo be convicted of an accessory charge, the accused must generally be proved to have had actual knowledge that a crime was going to be, or had been, committed. Furthermore, there must be proof that the accessory knew that his or her action, or inaction, was helping the criminals commit the crime, or evade detection, or escape. A person who unknowingly houses a person who has just committed a crime, for instance, may not be charged with an accessory offense because they did not have knowledge of the crime.\n\nIn many jurisdictions a person may not be charged as an accessory to a crime committed by his or her spouse. This is related to the traditional privilege not to testify against an accused spouse, and the older idea that a wife was completely subject to the orders of a husband, whether lawful or illegal.\n\nIn most jurisdictions an accessory cannot be tried before the principal is convicted, unless the accessory and principal are tried together, or unless the accessory consents to being tried first.\n\nThe term \"accessory\" derives from the English common law, and been inherited by those countries with a more or less Anglo-American legal system. The concept of complicity is, of course, common across different legal traditions. The specific terms \"accessory-before-the-fact\" and \"accessory-after-the-fact\" were used in England and the United States but are now more common in historical than in current usage.\n\nThe spelling accessary is occasionally used, but only in this legal sense.\n\nThe English legal authority William Blackstone, in his \"Commentaries\", defined an accessory as:\n\nHe goes on to define an \"accessory-before-the-fact\" in these words:\n\nand an \"accessory-after-the-fact\" as follows:\n\nThe \"Criminal Code\" has several sections which deal with accessory to offences:\n\nFor these purposes, \"abetting\" means \"to encourage or set on\" and an \"abettor\" is \"an instigator or setter on, one who promotes or procures a crime to be committed...\"\n\nNote that under s. 21(2), the words \"ought to have known\" indicating objective knowledge have been ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada in cases where the principal offence requires subjective foresight of the consequences, such as murder (\"R v Logan\", [1990] 2 SCR 731).\n\nArticle 121-6 states that \"the accomplice to the offence, in the meaning of article 121-7, is punishable as a perpetrator\". Article 121-7 distinguishes, in its two paragraphs, complicity by aiding or abetting and complicity by instigation. It thus states that:\nEach penal provision in the Norwegian criminal code specifies if it is criminal to aid and abet. Further, when the attempt is criminal, participating in that attempt is criminal.\n\nThe law governing complicity in criminal offences originally arose from the common law, but was codified in section 8 of the Accessories and Abettors Act 1861 (as amended by s.65(4) Criminal Law Act 1977), which states:\nMere presence at the scene of a crime is not enough, even where the defendant remains at the scene to watch the crime being committed. In \"R v Coney\" (1882) 8 QBD 534, where a crowd watched an illegal prize fight, it was held that there must be active, not mere passive, encouragement. Hence, even though the fight would not have taken place without spectators prepared to bet on the outcome, the spectators were acquitted because their presence was accidental. It would have been different if they had attended at the scene of a crime by prior agreement because their mere presence would be an encouragement. Similarly, in \"R v J. F. Alford Transport Ltd\" (1997) 2 Cr. App. R. 326 it was held a reasonable inference that a company, knowing that its employees are acting illegally and deliberately doing nothing to prevent it from being repeated, actually intends to encourage the repetition. This will be a natural inference in any situation where the alleged accessory has the right to control what the principal is doing.\n\nA \"mens rea\" is required even when it is not required for the principal offender (for example, when the principal commits a strict liability offence). The defendant must intend to do the acts which he knows will assist or encourage the principal to commit a crime of a certain type. In \"R v Bainbridge\" (1960) 1 QB 129 the defendant supplied cutting equipment not knowing exactly what crime was going to be committed, but was convicted because the equipment supplied was not used in the ordinary way, but for a criminal purpose instead. The accomplice must also know of all the essential matters that make the act a crime, but need not know that the act would amount to a crime because \"ignorantia juris non excusat\". In \"National Coal Board v Gamble\" (1959) 1 QB 11 the operator of a weighbridge was indifferent as to whether the principal committed the offence which is generally not a sufficient \"mens rea\", but the NCB was convicted because the act of the employee was an act of sale (see vicarious liability).\n\n\"Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority\" (1986) AC 112 is an example of a type of case where the uncertainties of the precise meaning of intention effectively confer a sometimes welcome discretion on whether to impose responsibility. That case concerned the question of whether a doctor giving contraceptive advice or treatment to a girl under the age of 16 could be liable as an accessory to a subsequent offence of unlawful sexual intercourse committed by the girl's sexual partner. The Lords held that generally this would not be the case (the action was a civil one for a declaration) since the doctor would lack the necessary intention (even though he realised that his actions would facilitate the intercourse). One rationale for the decision would be that a jury would not infer intention in such circumstances if they thought that the doctor was acting in what he considered to be the girl's best interests.\n\nIn Scotland, under section 293 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, a person may be convicted of, and punished for, a contravention of any enactment, notwithstanding that he was guilty of such contravention as art and part only.\n\nU.S. jurisdictions (that is, the federal government and the various state governments) have come to treat accessories before the fact differently from accessories after the fact. All U.S. jurisdictions have effectively eliminated the distinction between accessories before the fact and principals, either by doing away with the category of \"accessory before the fact\" entirely or by providing that accessories before the fact are guilty of the same offense as principals. The Model Penal Code's definition of accomplice liability includes those who at common law were called accessories before the fact; under the Model Penal Code, accomplices face the same liability as principals. It is now possible to be convicted as an accessory before the fact even though the principal has not been convicted or (in most jurisdictions) even if the principal was acquitted at an earlier trial.\n\nHowever, modern U.S. jurisdictions punish accessories after the fact for a separate criminal offense distinct from the underlying crime and having a different (and less severe) punishment. Some states still use the term \"accessory after the fact\"; others no longer use the term, but have comparable laws against hindering apprehension or prosecution, obstruction of justice, tampering with evidence, harboring a felon, or the like. Such crimes usually require proving (1) an intent to hinder apprehension or prosecution and (2) actual aid in the form of either (a) harboring the criminal, (b) providing specified means (such as a disguise) to evade arrest, (c) tampering with evidence, (d) warning the criminal of impending arrest, or (e) using force or deception to prevent the arrest.\n\nFederal law has followed both these trends. The U.S. Code effectively treats as principals those who would traditionally have been considered accessories before the fact at common law:\nHowever, federal law treats accessories after the fact differently from principals. Accessories after the fact face a maximum of only half the fine and half the prison time that principals face. (If the principal faces the death penalty or life imprisonment, accessories after the fact face up to 15 years' imprisonment.) Federal law defines accessories after the fact as persons who provide criminals with certain aid in order to hinder a criminal's apprehension or prosecution:\n\n"}

The game puts the player in the role of a new program director for a TV station. The player is in charge of selecting programming and earning advertising for the station, while simultaneously trying to marry Betty, an attractive woman working in the building.\n\nThe main interface of the game involves moving a thin man through a multistory building via mouse clicks. By clicking on various doors, the player's character can enter other locations, which are portrayed in cut scenes. Each day is timed, and after eight game hours the day of programming ends.\n\nFor each day, the player must program seven hours of television and provide an advertisement block for each of those programs. The game offers many options to fill programming, such as purchasing the rights to classic movies and shows, or by producing your own shows. However, programming must be regularly cycled, otherwise it gets stale with the audience and produces low ratings.\n\nAdvertising is also offered via contracts, which require certain rating marks to pay out. For example, a contract for Nike might pay better than one for a local business, but the Nike contract will require substantially more viewers. Access to more viewers can be achieved by buying more transmitters and satellites.\n\nThe player competes against two other television stations, run by computer-controlled program directors, in the same building. These program directors inhabit the same space and locations as the player, and they can directly influence the game by outbidding the player for certain movies or sabotaging programming lineups.\n\nThe eventual goal of the game is to win Betty's love. She is a cultural reporter who works on the top floor of the building. The other television station directors are also competing for Betty. Her affection rises when the player airs her culture program or buys her gifts, ranging from fur coats to diamond rings. Furthermore, Betty's love depends indirectly on the reputation the player has (which in turn depends on several factors such as ratings). Her affection level will never outrun the player's reputation level, so there is no use in simply pleasing her and neglecting the audience.\nUnfortunately cultural programs are not popular; airing only Betty's favorites will cause bankruptcy. The player has to balance his budget.\n\nThe game suffers from many translation issues, resulting from its origin as a game originally produced in Germany. Much of the in-game text features typos and Denglisch.\n\n\"Mad TV\" has a sequel, \"Mad TV 2\", which was only released in Germany. In 2001 \"Mad TV\" and also \"Mad TV 2\" were released as freeware.\n\n\n"}

It has been able to achieve considerable results in didactics, research, and international relations according to CENSIS and the Italian Ministry of Education.\n\nThe didactic and scientific activities are concentrated around three main \"areas\": the city area, with the Departments of Economics and Management, Sociology an Social research, Humanities, the Faculty of Law and the School of International Studies; the hill area, with the Departments of Civil, Environmental and Mechanical Engineering, Information Engineering and Computer Science, Industrial Engineering, Mathematics, Physics and CIBIO - Centre for Integrative Biology; the Department of Psychology and Cognitive Science and CIMeC - Centre for Mind/Brain Sciences in Rovereto. \n\nThe University of Trento was founded in 1962 as a Higher University Institute for Social Sciences. It then became the first Faculty of Sociology in Italy. The impact on the city was quite contradictory: the University was seen both as a motivating force for cultural openness and the creation of a new leading class, but also as a fracturing element of protest.\n\nIn order to expand the educational opportunities of the University of Trento, in 1972 the Faculty of Science was founded and in 1973 so was the Faculty of Economics. The academic project was expanded in 1984 with the Faculties of Arts and Humanities and Law and in 1985 with the Faculty of Engineering. In 2004 the Faculty of Cognitive Sciences was founded. \n\n\n\nSpecial importance has been given to the International dimension of the University ever since its first years. The University has focused on \nthe development of strategic international alliances\n\nin\nthe view of complementarity.\n\nThe University has partnerships with prestigious universities and research centers all over the world and is part of important cooperation networks (for instance Consorzio Time, Asea-Uninet GE4).\n\nAside from the LLP-Erasmus project, since 1997 the University has also supported double degree agreements. The most recent one is the double degree in Civil Engineering with the University of Tongi China (May 2008): students can achieve a Master in Civil Engineering and the two year Master course in Civil Engineering in Trento. The University is part of the Erasmus Mundus programme and the Erasmus Mundus External cooperation window (now called action 2 of Erasmus Mundus II). \n\nThe University has a number of bilateral agreements with universities in Asia, America, the Middle East and Oceania. There is collaboration for development co-operation with African and Latin American universities. Foreign Tenured scholars and Visiting professors are 10% of the total number of professors. Collaboration with Germany brought Trento to the Italian seat of the Italian-German University, an institution that deals with coordination for advanced training and research between Italian and German universities.\n\nIn 2012, the University of Trento celebrated its first 50 years: a tradition that brings it to be acknowledged as one of the leading universities in Italy, as indicated by several national rankings: the quality of the University of Trento was confirmed by the first national evaluation carried out by MIUR (The Ministry of Education, Universities and Research) and published in the summer of 2009. The University of Trento, according to the ministerial criteria, proved to have reached the best national standards for the quality of its research and teaching. With this result the University earned the title of “the most virtuous university in Italy”.\n\nThe 2013 Report by ANVUR (Italian National Agency for the Evaluation of the University system) UniTrento ranks first in the category of scientific production of medium-sized universities.\n\nIn the yearly CENSIS results, made in junction with the Grande Guida, and published by La Repubblica, the University of Trento is always in the very first positions. In the last edition (2015-2016) it is confirmed the second place in the mid-size universities (between 10 and 20 thousand students), an improvement of the score from 97,8 to 99,8.\n\nBy the last Sole 24 Ore ranking of the best Italian State Universities, the University of Trento is the second.\n\nIn the 2015-2016 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, the University of Trento placed #198 in the world.\n\nIn the Best University Under 50 Years Old by Times Higher Education World University Ranking, the University of Trento was ranked #37 in the world.\n\nThe Department of Computer Science of Trento U was ranked top 50 in Europe through Microsoft Academic Ranking, and was placed #92 in the world by Times Higher Education World University Ranking 2020.\n\nUniversity of Trento and Microsoft Research open in Trento \"The Centre for Computational and Systems Biology\" (COSBI). The University of Trento has been increasing the number of courses available in English in parallel with its increased internationalization. \n\nIn collaboration with the Opera Universitaria, Trento University offers 1500 accommodations in the San Bartolameo Campus, in student residences or flats that have special agreements with the University. The University has a central library composed of different buildings (in each Faculty) where students can consult books or borrow them, study or use the internet, with long opening hours (even until midnight), open Saturday and Sunday. With the Welcome Office, the University supports International students and researchers in the administrative procedures connected with their arrival and stay in Trento (entry visa, residence permit, health insurance, accommodation, National insurance number, etc.) and gives information as regards the modalities and documentation needed to enroll. Thanks to the Opera Universitaria, the University is able to offer students grants. Starting from academic year 2008/2009, the University radically changed its university fees system, emphasizing merit and students' efforts. Those who enroll have the chance to apply for grants up to €4000. The latest project born at the University of Trento is UNI.sport,\n\nthe new university network for sports services and facilities dedicated to the students of Trento University. \n\nThe University of Trento, in collaboration with Opera Universitaria and the Bank of Trento and Rovereto, opened the \"collegio\" in October 2010.

The system then developed following the evolution of the University, in particular in 1972, with the creation of the Faculty of Sciences, in 1973, with the opening of Economics and in 1984 and 1985 with creation respectively of the Faculty of Humanities, Law and Engineering. The library has been a member of the Bibliographic Catalogue of Trentino since 1984 thus making it possible to search its contents online.

{"id": "1949703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949703", "title": "Turtle Island (Lake Erie)", "text": "Turtle Island (Lake Erie)\n\nTurtle Island is a island in the western portion of Lake Erie in the United States. The island has an unusual political status, as its jurisdiction is divided between the U.S. states of Michigan and Ohio, even though the island has no residents or current use. Turtle Island is located about northeast of the mouth of the Maumee River in Maumee Bay. Today, the island houses several abandoned structures and the ruins of Turtle Island Light, a lighthouse dating back to 1866. According to the Census Bureau, most of the island lies in Jerusalem Township in Lucas County, Ohio with the smaller Michigan portion being part of Erie Township.\n\nThe Miami tribe was the first to inhabit the small island prior to 1800. They used the island primarily to gather seagull eggs. The island was named after Miami chief Mishikinakwa (), who was an influential Native American leader in the Northwest Territory during the American Revolution. Nicknamed Little Turtle, he later became popular among the American people after dissenting from his native tribe in the pursuit of peace negotiations with the Americans.\n\nThe British operated a small fort on the island around 1794 in defense of the mouth of the Maumee River, but the fort was soon abandoned. There are conflicting accounts as to who maintained control of the island during this time. Local folklore alludes to the belief that the Indians controlled the island and used it as a military fort, while others claim the British held control of it until losing it during the War of 1812. Official accounts of the history of Turtle Island date back to 1827, when the island itself was sold at a federal government auction in nearby Monroe, Michigan. Turtle Island was believed to not even be a true island on its own but rather a former extension of Little Cedar Point Peninsula. The island was bought but sold back to the United States four years later.\n\nWith the completion of the Toledo Harbor Light in 1904, the shallower shipping lane around Turtle Island was rerouted to deeper waters, and the lighthouse on Turtle Island was abandoned. Turtle Island Light was officially decommissioned on May 15, 1904. Federal officials removed the components of the lighthouse but left all the structures in place. The island was sold at an auction to A. H. Merrill for $1,650 in December 1904. The island went unused and was subsequently vandalized over the next 30 years. Most of the original structures were completely stripped of their elements. In the late 1920s, the \"Toledo Blade\" reported on the status of the island by saying, “Vandals have wrecked the house, stealing everything that could be salvaged from the structure except the grim, bare walls which stand as a monument to the service this light rendered for nearly half a century.”\n\nIn 1933, A. H. Merrill transferred ownership of the island to George Merrill. He signed a lease with the Associated Yacht Club of Toledo (AYC) for them to build a series of docks and use the island for recreational purposes. However, the AYC ran out of money during the Great Depression and was forced to abandon their plans for rejuvenating Turtle Island. The AYC attempted to work with the state of Ohio to receive funding to revamp the island, but the state determined the cost of restoring the island would exceed its beneficial use by the public since the island was too small and remote. The AYC abandoned the island in 1937, and the island continued to decay with no improvements. The lighthouse keeper's headquarters were demolished, and the island suffered further damage from strong winds and waves during the 1965 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak.\n\nThe small strip of land surrounding the mouth of the Maumee River was under the jurisdiction of the Michigan Territory, because the borders originally drawn up for the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 set a territorial boundary as a straight line from the southernmost edge of Lake Michigan. When Ohio became the first in the Northwest Territory to gain statehood in 1803, the state's northern border did not include this important area, which was later given to the Michigan Territory when it was formally organized in 1805. Turtle Island fell under the jurisdiction of the Michigan Territory, and when the first Turtle Island Light was constructed in 1831, it was within the boundaries of the territory. When Toledo was founded in 1833, it was part of the Michigan Territory, and the Port of Toledo operated the lighthouse. Because Ohio disputed Michigan's ownership over this area, it led to the heated Toledo War, a border dispute between the Michigan Territory and the state of Ohio for the area known as the Toledo Strip. In late 1836, President Andrew Jackson intervened on behalf of Ohio and gave the Toledo Strip to Ohio in exchange for Michigan getting the Upper Peninsula when it became a state soon after on January 26, 1837.\n\nThe Toledo Strip and the city of Toledo became part of Ohio, but Turtle Island remained part of the Michigan Territory. The lighthouse was still operated by the Port of Toledo, but the island was still claimed and charted as Michigan territory within Monroe County. Control of the island was not disputed by either state, and the political status of the island was forgotten after the lighthouse was decommissioned in 1904. The state boundary of Ohio and Michigan remained unchanged from 1837 until 1973 when the status of Turtle Island was finally recognized and resolved long after tensions over the Toledo War had ended. The Supreme Court of the United States intervened, and on February 22, 1973, an agreement was reached between the two states. The state lines were redrawn for the last time to cut exactly through the center of the tiny island's diameter sea wall at a 45° angle, while the ruins of the lighthouse itself were included in the Ohio half. The island was divided between Monroe County and Ohio's Lucas County. This was merely an act of politics, as the island had been abandoned and continually decaying for the past 70 years. The Michigan half fell under the jurisdiction of Erie Township, while the city of Toledo assumed full control over the other half.\n\nThe island remains privately owned, and Turtle Island only has remnants of structures still standing. In February 2002, the owner of the island attempted to build three new buildings on the island with the reported intent of using them for summer vacation rentals. Authorities in Monroe County issued a decree to stop the construction, because the owner failed to get the building permits to build on the Michigan side of the island. The decree was ignored, but the structures were never completely finished before they were mostly destroyed by large ice packs during the winter of 2009. Erie Township, which has jurisdiction over the Michigan half of Turtle Island, has planned to remove the now-destroyed structures from the island and clean up the remaining debris. This action has not taken place yet, because the cost of doing so would be too expensive. The township has continually debated on what to do with the island.\n\nThe only thing that remains of the 1866 Turtle Island Light is the tower, although the top of the tower was blown off during a windstorm on Palm Sunday in 1965, exposing the iron spikes that once held the lantern in place. Continued efforts at restoring the lighthouse have been unsuccessful. Portions of the concrete wall constructed to originally protect the lighthouse have also eroded away, further exposing the island. \"Lighthouse Digest\" lists the decaying Turtle Island Light as critically endangered on its Doomsday List of threatened lighthouses. Even though the island is remote, it is currently closed to the public, although it is impossible for this to be enforced.\n\n"}

After Roman occupation, it was finally settled by Bavarii tribes in the 5th century AD. In 804 Bad Aibling was mentioned for the first time as \"Epininga\". In mediaeval times, it was an administrative centre in the lordship of the Counts of Falkenstein. After the obliteration of the Neuburg-Falkenstein dynasty, it became part of the realm of the Wittelsbach family.\n\nIn 1845 the first treatments with peat pulp were offered by the physician Desiderius Beck. Bad Aibling received the title \"Bad\" (spa or springs) in 1895.\n\nIn the year 1933, Bad Aibling officially became a town. After the Second World War, Bad Aibling was the site of POW Discharge Center #26, where German POWs were released from captivity to civilian status. In 1946, a DP camp housing former members of the Royal Yugoslav Army was set up on the grounds of the town's airbase. The camp was first operated by UNRRA, and later by the IRO. From 1948 onwards, the area was home to the \"IRO Children's Village\", a DP camp for unaccompanied children and youth belonging to more than 20 nationalities. Over 2,300 inhabitants passed through this facility (the largest of its kind in the US Zone) before it was closed in late 1951. Later, the area evolved into a major centre for intelligence organizations and secret services.\n\nIn 2005 the American Bad Aibling ECHELON station (Field Station 81) closed after several decades of operation. After the departure of the NSA, parts of the station have been used by the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND), with NSA employees moving to the Mangfall barracks. The radomes are still used intensively. The station is used in cooperation with the NSA, which provides the BND with search terms (such as email addresses), which then forwards the results back to the NSA.\n\nThe Thermae opened in 2007, complementing the traditional peat pulp baths with mineral water (Desiderius-Quelle). In the same year, the historical Ludwigsbad spa hotel, the nucleus of Bad Aibling's health resort business, burned down due to arson.\n\nOn 9 February 2016, a serious railway accident occurred near the town when two passenger trains collided, causing 11 fatalities.\n\nThe town of Bad Aibling, with about 18,000 inhabitants, is at above sea level and covers an area of .\n\nBad Aibling consists of the neighborhoods (Stadtteile) of Abel, Adlfurt, Bad Aibling Mitte, Berbling, Ellmosen, Fachendorf, Gröben, Harthausen, Haslach, Heimathsberg, Heinrichsdorf, Holzhausen, Köckbrunn, Markfeld, Mietraching, Mitterham, Moos, Natternberg, Thalacker, Thürham, Unterheufeld, Weg, Westen, Westerham, Willing, and Zell.\n\nIn Bad Aibling there are several large spa hotels and rehabilitation hospitals that rely on peat pulp as a basic treatment. Additionally, in 2007 the new thermae were opened.\n\nSeveral companies in the pharmaceutical industry, textile manufacturing, electrical engineering, plastics manufacturing, and dairy processing are located in Bad Aibling.\n\n\n\n\nThe Echelon Open Air & Indoor Festival is an electro-, techno and house-festival that has taken place in Bad Aibling annually in August since 2009. With about 25.000 visitors in 2015 it is the largest festival of its kind in Bavaria. It is located on the abandoned Bad Aibling Station which was used for the festival's eponymous global surveillance network ECHELON.\n\nBad Aibling has been twinned with\n\n\n"}

It is currently the subject of an innovative project run jointly by the Met Office and the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe natural environment affects human health. There are many cases in which the weather has a direct or indirect effect on the health of an individual. These include:\n\n\nHealth forecasts help professionals and patients know when and where there is a risk of illness. Through this understanding, preventative action can be taken and health care capacity (i.e. hospitals and doctors) managed to reduce illness and death.\n\nThe main strand of the health forecasting project is forecasting the risk of exacerbation for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD health forecasts are used to drive the provision of anticipatory care to people with COPD, helping them achieve their potential for independence and wellbeing. The service is being run in around 30 primary care trusts with over 20,000 patient registered to receive alerts. In many areas alerts are provided by an automated interactive telephone. Evidence from several evaluations of the service has shown around a 20% reduction in COPD related emergency admissions for practices using the service.\n\nOn 26 February 2007, the project won in the Innovative Service Award category at the Health and Social Care Awards 2006. The Health and Social Care Awards are run annually in partnership between the Department of Health and the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement and are the most important opportunity within the NHS and social care to identify, recognise and reward excellence in the provision of care at the front line. The specific award recognises an innovative, new or improved service that is benefiting the delivery of health care for patients, users and carers.\n\nIn 2011 the Shanghai Meteorological Service and Shanghai Municipal Public Health Bureau jointly launched a health meteorological service that includes health forecasting for conditions such as colds, asthma, COPD and a heat health warning service. This will be developed based on a considerable amount of research to provide a service to improve healthcare in Shanghai.\n\n"}

Smith's home and \"That Man\" is a studio recording, an outtake from the recording sessions for the \"Fiery Jack\" single.\n\nRather than record themselves in front of a receptive home crowd, the Fall chose to use recordings made in working men's clubs and other less obvious settings; Side 1 of the album was recorded at a leisure centre near Doncaster while the first two tracks on Side 2 are from a February 1980 gig in Bradford. It is clear on the recording that the reception the band received ranged from indifferent to hostile, the enmity between band and audience evident from Smith's introductory statement \"The difference between you and us is that we have brains\". Friction within the band is also apparent, with Smith apparently chastising one of the musicians during \"No Xmas for John Quays\" with \"Will you fuckin' get it together instead of showing off\".\n\nSmith said of the album in his 2008 book \"Renegade\": \n\"Nobody wanted to release it, because nobody played the sort of venues that you hear on it – places like Doncaster and Preston. The North was out of bounds; it might as well have been another country. We just pieced a load of tapes together. In the band's eyes it was commercial suicide releasing this dirge; they couldn't see the soul that lay behind it. That's musicians for you.\"\n\nThe album was released on 5 May 1980, the band's first release after signing to Rough Trade Records.\n\nDave McCullough in \"Sounds\" gave the album a five star rating, calling the band \"a living reminder of the failure of Punk and the almost solitary exponents of the directions in which it should have gone\". Robert Christgau gave the album a B rating, describing himself as \"a sucker for the overall sound, maybe even the attitude\". AllMusic reviewer Ned Raggett gave the album three stars, stating that it saw the band in \"a hilariously aggressive mood\", and delivering \"some brilliant performances\". Martin Longley, in a 1998 review, gave it three stars, calling it \"a terse, brittle classic of cranky Mark E. Smith ranting\". A 2002 review of the reissued album was given two stars by Marc Savlov in \"The Austin Chronicle\", describing it as \"live with God-awful acoustics and utter crap recording that renders it barely there at the best moments\". \"Trouser Press\" described the album as \"Jagged, largely recitative and nearly oblivious to musical convention, Smith's witty repartee carries the show as the band lurches and grunts along noisily.\"\n\nThe album was chosen by Luke Haines in 2011 as one of his favourite thirteen albums.\n\nThe album topped the UK Independent Chart in 1980, spending a total of 31 weeks on the chart.\n\n\n\nThe album has been issued on CD several times, in 1992 by Dojo, in 1998 and 2004 by Castle Communications, and in 2017 by Westworld Recordings. The 2004 Castle reissue included the Fall's third Peel session as bonus tracks. It was reissued on vinyl in 2004 by Earmark, and in 2017 by Let Them Eat Vinyl.\n"}

Kangaroos were created as an expedient measure \"in the field\" by the Canadian Army, and were so successful that they were used by British and Commonwealth forces.\n\nTheir ability to manoeuvre in the field with tanks was a major advantage over earlier designs, and led to the dedicated APC designs that were introduced by almost all armies immediately after the war.\n\nThe earliest iterations of the Kangaroo were created from M3 and M5 Stuart light tanks to serve as artillery tractors in North Africa campaign in circumstances where Universal Carriers were unavailable. They were effective in their role, but attempts by soldiers to use them as improvised APCs proved ill-advised due to the Stuart's very light armour. \n\nIn July 1944, Lieutenant-General Harry Crerar's First Canadian Army was concerned by manpower shortages due to combat losses. While the British and Canadian forces had received some American M3 Half-track APCs, the supply was heavily reduced by this point due to the Americans' own need for them, and Universal Carriers were individually insufficient despite the enormous numbers. However, self-propelled artillery and tanks were currently oversupplied, with a significant number sitting idle not being used. Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds, commander of II Canadian Corps, devised Kangaroos as a field-expedient alternative to purpose-built APCs.\n\nThe original Kangaroos were converted from 72 M7 Priest self-propelled guns of three field artillery regiments of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division. The Priests were \"defrocked\" at the Advanced Workshop\nDepot under the codename \"Kangeroo\", removing their 105mm guns and ammunition stowage, and separating the driver's compartment from the rest of the vehicle. Priests with machine gun turrets retained them, and some that did not already have machine gun mounts had improvised ones fitted. When the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division was re-equipped with towed Ordnance QF 25-pounder gun-howitzers in late July, the rest of their self-propelled tracked vehicles were stripped of their 105mm guns and converted to Kangaroos. Later Kangaroos were based on Sherman, Churchill, and obsolete Canadian Ram tanks. The process was broadly similar, with the entire turret removed, ammunition storage removed, bench seats fitted in the turret ring area, and the driver's compartment separated. Hull machine guns were retained, and new machine guns were sometimes fitted to the turret ring. Kangaroos in general were supposed to carry 8 to 12 soldiers, though similar to the practice of troops riding on tanks, it was more common to simply cram as many as could fit without being at risk of falling off.\n\nThe Priest Kangaroos were first used on 8 August 1944 south of Caen during Operation Totalize to supplement the half-tracks already available. When re-converted Kangaroos were returned to U.S. custody, other vehicles were pressed into service, the vast majority (some 500) being Rams, which were standing idle after being used as training vehicles when Canadian armoured formations re-equipped with Shermans. The Ram gun tanks were shipped to France and duly converted, deploying piecemeal as they arrived.\n\nWhile 'debussing' - climbing out of the hull and jumping down, potentially under fire - was challenging, the obvious difficulty of getting into a vehicle that was designed to prevent enemy soldiers climbing onto it was quickly appreciated. Accordingly, climbing rungs were soon added as a field modification that also simplified loading the carrying compartment with ammunition, food and other supplies to troops under fire.\n\nThe Ram Kangaroo entered service piecemeal with the Canadians in September 1944, but in December these minor units were combined to form the 1st Canadian Armoured Carrier Regiment (initially the 1st Canadian Armoured Personnel Carrier Regiment), joining the British 49th Armoured Carrier Regiment under the British 79th Armoured Division which was the administrative division for the deployment of the specialized combat support vehicles known as \"Hobart's Funnies\".\n\nThe first operation for the Ram Kangaroo was the assault on Le Havre, the last the 7th Armoured Division's march into Hamburg on 3 May 1945.\n\nIn Italy, Sherman III tanks and some Priests were converted for use by the British Eighth Army. Removing the turret of the Sherman and some internal fittings gave room for carrying up to ten troops.\n\nFrom 1943, Stuart tanks (both M3 and M5) had their turrets removed and seating fitted to carry infantry troops attached to British armoured brigades.\n\n\n\n"}

Via the New, Kanawha and Ohio rivers, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River, draining an area of . It is one of the longest rivers in West Virginia.\n\nThe Greenbrier is formed at Durbin in northern Pocahontas County by the confluence of the East Fork Greenbrier River and the West Fork Greenbrier River, both of which are short streams rising at elevations exceeding and flowing for their entire lengths in northern Pocahontas County. From Durbin the Greenbrier flows generally south-southwest through Pocahontas, Greenbrier and Summers Counties, past several communities including Cass, Marlinton, Hillsboro, Ronceverte, Fort Spring, Alderson, and Hinton, where it flows into the New River.\n\nAlong most of its course, the Greenbrier accommodated the celebrated Indian warpath known as the Seneca Trail (Great Indian Warpath). From the vicinity of present-day White Sulphur Springs the Trail followed Anthony's Creek down to the Greenbrier near the present Pocahontas-Greenbrier County line. It then ascended the River to the vicinity of Hillsboro and Droop Mountain and made its way through present Pocahontas County by way of future Marlinton, Indian Draft Run, and Edray.\n\nThe first permanent white settlers west of the Alleghenies have traditionally been considered to have been two New Englanders: Jacob Marlin and Stephen Sewell, who arrived in the Greenbrier Valley in 1749. They built a cabin together at what would become Marlinton, but after disputing over religion, Sewell moved into a nearby hollowed-out sycamore tree. In 1751, surveyor John Lewis (father of Andrew Lewis) discovered the pair. Sewell eventually settled on the eastern side of Sewell Mountain, near present-day Rainelle. They may well have been the first to settle what was then called the \"western waters\" — i.e., in the regions where streams flowed westward to the Gulf of Mexico rather than eastward to the Atlantic.\n\nColonel John Stuart (1749–1823), a Revolutionary War commander and pioneering western Virginia settler, surveyed and settled the Greenbrier Valley and is known locally as the \"Father of Greenbrier County\". At the age of twenty, Stuart was a member of the 1769 survey by citizens of Augusta County, Virginia, which explored the wilderness of the Greenbrier Valley to the west in preparation for European settlement. The following year he built the first mill in present-day Greenbrier County, at Frankford. In 1774, he led a company of Greenbrier troops in the Battle of Point Pleasant at the confluence of the Kanawha and Ohio Rivers. He was among Lewisburg's first trustees and in 1780 he became Greenbrier County's first clerk, leaving many historic records behind.\n\nThe Greenbrier is the longest untamed (unblocked) river left in the Eastern United States. It is heavily used for recreational pursuits. Its upper reaches flow through the Monongahela National Forest, and it is paralleled for by the Greenbrier River Trail, a rail trail which runs between the communities of Cass and North Caldwell.\n\nIt has always been a valuable water route, with the majority of the important cities in the watershed being established riverports. The river gives the receiving waters of the New River an estimated 30% of its water volume. Over three-fourths of the watershed is an extensive karstic (cavern system), which supports fine trout fishing, cave exploration and recreation. Many important festivals and public events are held along the river throughout the watershed.\n\nIn honor of the river's use in the state's logging history, the West Virginia State Park, Cass Scenic Railroad in Cass has a car called \"The Greenbrier River.\"\n\nAccording to the Geographic Names Information System, the Greenbrier River has also been known historically as:\n\nThe unique karstlands of the Greenbrier River Valley — underlain by the Greenbrier Limestone Formation — constitute one of the world's densest sinkhole plains, with an average of 18 sinkholes per square kilometer. This green \"moonscape\" of collapsed craters is a unique problem for development as the ground is prone to subsidization. It is impossible to tell how large a cave system is by looking at the surface, and developers often build their structures too close to the open spaces beneath the ground. There is no current karst protection plan for any of the counties that are involved with this problem.\n\nThe aggregated caves and karst of the Greenbrier River Valley are among the world's Top Ten Endangered Karst Ecosystems as listed by the Karst Waters Institute in 2001.\n\nAmerican vertebrate paleontology arguably began in the sub-watershed of Second Creek, a Greenbrier tributary. Bones discovered by saltpeter miners in Haynes Cave close to the river in Monroe County were sent to (future President) Thomas Jefferson, who identified them as a previously unknown species. Without a skull for identification purposes, Jefferson used the eight-inch claws as an identifying mark, and named the skeleton, \"Megalonyx\" or \"Great Claw\". Later the bones were positively identified as that of a giant ground sloth. The name \"jeffersonii\" was later added to it in tribute. For years the sloth was mistakenly thought to be from another cave within the watershed, Organ Cave, but recent research indicates that Haynes Cave was the cave of origin. The \"Megalonyx jeffersonii\" is now the state fossil of West Virginia.\n\nThe West Virginia state gemstone is also part of the Greenbrier River watershed: The Lithostrotionella, a fossilized form of coral that is found in the Hillsdale Limestone group in Pocahontas and Greenbrier counties. Not an official gemstone, it is a siliceous chalcedony. It is found almost exclusively within Greenbrier and Pocahontas counties.\n\nThe Greenbrier hosts one of the state's two endemic species of salamanders, the West Virginia Spring Salamander in Fort Spring. The other salamander, the Cheat Mountain Salamander lives in the mountains of the headwaters.\n\nThe Candy Darter of Knapp Creek (Finescale saddled darter) is a survivor to when the Greenbrier followed a more ancient drainage pattern with Teays Valley.\n\nThe river is vulnerable to Nonpoint source pollution and sediment from timbering and flooding. It has been on the WV List of Impaired Streams since 2006 for the contamination of fecal coliform bacteria. Algae is becoming a known nuisance upon the waters, primarily in warm weather, and there is a need to study how much water can be pulled out of the river to supply the needs of communities in a state that practices little in the way of water conservation, even in times of drought. The West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection and various concerned citizen groups are working to prevent further stresses upon the river.\n\nOn December 17, 2009 the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection's James Summers released a report on its findings of algae in West Virginia rivers. The Greenbrier was deemed the most algae-affected river in the state, due to nutrient source tracking. Steps are currently being made to address this issue.\n\nThe \"New River Atlas\" has successfully mapped the Greenbrier from Ronceverte to Hinton, West Virginia. The Atlas shows the original batteau channels and historic man-made impacts.\n\n\n"}

The story is set in Roman Britain in the 2nd century AD, after the building of Hadrian's Wall.\n\nDischarged because of a battle wound, a young Roman officer Marcus Flavius Aquila tries to discover the truth about the disappearance of his father's legion in northern Britain. Disguised as a Greek oculist and travelling beyond Hadrian's Wall with his freed ex-slave, Esca, Marcus finds that a demoralized and mutinous Ninth Legion was annihilated by a great rising of the northern tribes. In part, this disgrace was redeemed through a heroic last stand by a small remnant (including Marcus's father) around the legion's eagle standard. Marcus's hope of seeing the lost legion re-established is dashed, but he is able to bring back the bronze eagle so that it can no longer serve as a symbol of Roman defeat – and thus will no longer be a danger to the frontier's security.\n\n\"The Eagle of the Ninth\" is one of Sutcliff's earlier books, but may be her best-known title. It is the first in a sequence of novels, followed by \"The Silver Branch\", \"Frontier Wolf\", \"The Lantern Bearers\" (which won a Carnegie Medal), \"Sword at Sunset\", \"Dawn Wind\", \"Sword Song\", and \"The Shield Ring\". The sequence loosely traces a family, of the Roman Empire and then of Britain, who inherit an emerald seal ring bearing the insignia of a dolphin.\nThe book has also been published as \"The Eagle\". It has been adapted a few times, most notably as the 2011 film \"The Eagle\".\n\nSutcliff wrote in a foreword that she created the story from two elements: the disappearance of the Legio IX \"Hispana\" (Ninth Legion) from the historical record following an expedition north to deal with Caledonian tribes in 117; and the discovery of a wingless Roman eagle in excavations at Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester). The Museum of Reading, which now houses the Silchester eagle, states that it \"is not a legionary eagle but has been immortalized as such by Rosemary Sutcliff\". It may originally have formed part of a Jupiter statue in the forum of the Roman town. Sutcliff also assumed that the legion's title of \"\"Hispana\"\" meant that it was raised in Hispania (now Spain and Portugal), but it was probably awarded this title for victories there.\n\nAt the time Sutcliff wrote, it was a plausible theory that the unit had been wiped out in Britain during a period of unrest early in the reign of the Emperor Hadrian (AD 117–138). Scholarly opinion now disputes this, for there are extant records that have been interpreted as indicating that detachments of the Ninth Legion were serving on the Rhine frontier later than the year 117, and it has been suggested that it was probably annihilated in the east of the Roman Empire. This in turn is disputed by other historians, who assert that it was indeed destroyed in northern Britain. Sheppard Frere, an eminent Romano-British authority, has concluded that \"further evidence is needed before more can be said\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

(1878–1945)\n\nManchester United Football Club was formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway depot at Newton Heath. The team initially played games against other departments and rail companies at their home ground at North Road, but by 1888 the club had become a founding member of The Combination, a regional football league. However, following the league's dissolution before the end of its first season, Newton Heath joined the newly formed Football Alliance, which ran for three seasons before being merged with The Football League. This resulted in the club starting the 1892–93 season in the First Division, by which time it had become independent of the rail company, dropped the \"LYR\" from its name and moved to a new ground at Bank Street. After just two seasons, the club was relegated to the Second Division.\n\nIn January 1902, with debts of £2,670 – equivalent to £ in 2020 – the club was served with a winding-up order. Captain Harry Stafford found four local businessmen – including John Henry Davies, who became club president – each willing to invest £500 in return for a direct interest in running the club. As a mark of this fresh start, on 24 April 1902, the club's name was changed to \"Manchester United\". Under Ernest Mangnall, who became club secretary in 1903, the team finished as Second Division runners-up in 1906 and secured promotion to the First Division, which it won in 1908 – the club's first league title. The following season began with victory in the first ever Charity Shield and ended with the club's first FA Cup title. Manchester United moved to a new stadium at Old Trafford in 1910, and won the First Division for the second time in 1911, but at the end of the following season, secretary Mangnall left to join Manchester City.\n\nIn 1922, three years after the resumption of football following the First World War, the club was relegated to the Second Division, where it remained until regaining promotion in 1925. Relegated again in 1931, Manchester United became a yo-yo club, achieving its all-time lowest position of 20th place in the Second Division in 1934. Following the death of John Henry Davies in October 1927, the club's finances deteriorated to the extent that Manchester United would likely have gone bankrupt had it not been for an investment of £2,000 in December 1931 by James W. Gibson, who assumed control of the club. In the 1938–39 season – the last year of football before the Second World War – the club finished 14th in the First Division. During the war, the club participated in the Wartime League and the Football League War Cup, but in 1941, Old Trafford was damaged by German bombs and would not be fully repaired until 1949.\n\nIn 1878 the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company granted permission for the employees of its Carriage and Wagon department to start a football team, which was subsequently named Newton Heath LYR, with Frederick Attock appointed as this new club's president. LYR stood for \"Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway\" and was used to distinguish the team from their colleagues from the Motive Power Division, who were known as Newton Heath Loco. The team was funded by the railway company, who paid the lease on its first home ground, a field close to the railway yard on North Road. It is said that the players were \"tough, diligent men who formed a powerful side\"; they initially played games against other teams of railway workers, very few of which were recorded. During the 1882–83 season, the team played a total of 26 recorded friendly matches, and the following season competed in the Lancashire Cup but lost 7–2 in the first round to the reserve team of Blackburn Olympic. In 1884, Newton Heath LYR applied for the Manchester and District Challenge Cup and reached the final, which they lost 3–0 to Hurst at Whalley Range. The team never failed to score at least three goals in each of the rounds leading up to the final, including in a first round match against Eccles that had to be replayed after the Eccles management protested about Newton Heath's third goal.\n\nNewton Heath reached the final of the Manchester and District Challenge Cup a further five times, winning all but one. Meanwhile, in 1886, the club began to expand by signing players of national reputation such as Jack Powell, who became club captain, Jack and Roger Doughty, and Tom Burke. In 1886–87 the club entered the FA Cup for the first time and were drawn away to Fleetwood Rangers in the first round; they managed to earn a 2–2 but when club captain Jack Powell refused to play a period of extra time, Fleetwood were awarded the tie. A subsequent unsuccessful protest to the Football Association led to Newton Heath LYR entering a self-imposed exile from the FA Cup, which lasted until 1889.\n\nIn 1888, having been spurned by the newly formed the Football League, Newton Heath entered their first ever league competition, becoming founder members of The Combination. In April 1889, The Combination hit financial difficulties and was wound up before the season could be completed.\n\nIn 1890, after an unsuccessful application (they received only one vote) to join the Football League, Newton Heath and 11 other clubs not in the League formed an organisation known as the Football Alliance, in which they finished eighth in the first season. After three further applications, the club joined the Football League when it merged with the Football Alliance in 1892 and Newton Heath was elected to the First Division. In their final season in the Football Alliance, the club finished second to Nottingham Forest, who joined them in the First Division. By this time, the club had severed its formal ties with the railway company and had dropped the \"LYR\" from their name, although most players were still employees of the railway company. The club had also become a limited company, raising £2000 of share capital (at £1 each) via an application form which was returned to club secretary A.H.Albut, the club's first full-time official, who also assumed managerial duties.\n\nIn their first season in the Football League, Newton Heath finished in last place and retained their First Division status by virtue of a win against Second Division champions Small Heath (later Birmingham City F.C.) in a test match. In 1893, the team moved to a new ground in Bank Street, Clayton, next to a chemical plant. It was said that when Newton Heath were losing, the plant would belch out acrid fumes in a bid to affect the visiting team. The 1893–94 campaign, however, was no better, and they once again were in the play-offs against Second Division champions Liverpool. This time, Newton Heath were defeated 2–0 and were relegated to the Second Division.\n\nOn 9 March 1895, the manager of visiting Walsall Town Swifts registered an official complaint against the state of the pitch; \"drab expanses of wet sand, tufted sparsely with grass\". The game went ahead and Newton Heath beat Walsall Town 14–0, the largest unofficial margin of victory in the club's history, but the result was declared null and void. In 1897, the club made the play-offs but failed to make back into the First Division.\n\nThey managed only 10th place in the 1901 season, losing more games than they won and with ticket sales flagging and debts mounting, the club decided to hold a four-day bazaar to raise money at St James Hall, Manchester. According to legend, one of the attractions was club captain Harry Stafford's St. Bernard dog, Major, who escaped with a collection tin on one of the nights after the bazaar had closed. Major then found his way to local brewer John Henry Davies, whose daughter became so smitten with it that he enquired about the origin of the tin, and in doing so saved the club.\n\nOn 9 January 1902, Club President William Healey applied to the court for a winding-up order against the club, claiming he was owed £242 17s. 10d.\n\nOn Monday, 13 January 1902, the \"Manchester Guardian\" reported:\n\nAttention was directed to the Second League by the unusual experience of Newton Heath. The club is financially in a bad way. A winding up order to meet a debt of £242 precipitated matters last week and no arrangements could be made for playing the game fixed for Saturday. One hears that a new club will be formed out of the ashes of the old one, but this has not been decided definitely.\n\nNewton Heath were revived in time to play their next fixture on Saturday 18 January 1902.\n\nIt was the escape and recapturing of the dog which led to the meeting between team captain Harry Stafford and Davies, heading a group of three other investors. Together, they came up with £2,000 to save the club.\n\nJohn Henry Davies became the club president, and on 26 April 1902, given that the team now had few ties with its origins; it was no longer based in Newton Heath, the new owners renamed the club Manchester United Football Club, after considering the alternative names \"Manchester Celtic\" and \"Manchester Central\". They also changed the team's colours to red and white.\n\nHaving been saved from liquidation by four wealthy businessmen, the club played its first season as Manchester United in 1902–03. The badly needed injection of cash, plus some new players, gave the flagging side the boost it needed. They won 15 league games, notched up 38 points, and finished fifth.\n\nAfter a bad start to the season, the club took another important step in 1903 in hiring their first real team manager, Ernest Mangnall, a charismatic publicist who knew how to work the media. Under his leadership, the team finished third in the Second Division. The following season, Manchester United set a record when they went 18 games undefeated after losing to Bolton 2–0 in September 1904 up until they lost to Lincoln City 3–0 in February 1905. During the season they finished 3rd with 53 points. Off the field the club suffered a financial setback when they were banned from selling alcohol inside the ground, although under the ownership of Davies they at least had solid financial backing.\nMangnall created United's first successful side with a series of signings, eventually winning promotion in 1906. They finished second overall and reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, beating holders Aston Villa (one of the most successful English teams of that era) 5–1 in the fifth round. Among these signings was Billy Meredith, the legendary winger who was probably the greatest player of that era.\n\nErnest Mangnall managed to sign star defender Herbert Burgess, Alec \"Sandy\" Turnbull, and Jimmy Bannister after a scandal hit Manchester City and forced them to sell off most of their team. It paid off, and Manchester United won their first League Championship in 1908. They even attempted to sign Australian rugby footballer, Dally Messenger, a man recognised by some to be the top footballer of any code in his day. The next year, FA Cup success would follow as they beat Bristol City in the final 1–0. Sandy Turnbull scored the only goal and Billy Meredith was named man of the match.\nIn 1908, John Henry Davies once again gave financial aid by lending £60,000, a huge sum at the time, to finalise the team's move to a new stadium at Old Trafford. They played their first game there on 19 February 1910 as Liverpool spoiled the celebrations with a 4–3 win in a close game. United finished that season fifth in the league.\n\nErnest Mangnall's leadership brought United to their first successful era. They would be the first winners of the Charity Shield in 1908, and the League again in 1911 pipping Aston Villa on a tense last day of the season. The Charity Shield victory in 1911 would be the end of this era and Mangnall would leave the next year for Manchester City.\nManchester United players, in particular, Charlie Roberts and Billy Meredith, were instrumental in forming the Association of Football Players' and Trainers' Union (the AFPTU) (which the press called the Players' Union) in December 1907, the second attempt to unionize players. The Players Union is today the Professional Footballers' Association. When the Football Association threatened members of the Union with suspension before the start of the 1909–10 season, Manchester United players refused to relinquish their Union membership, and referred to themselves as \"The Outcasts\". A compromise was reached between the Football Association and the Union before the start of that season which allowed players to be Union members.\nWithout Mangnall, the club stumbled to 13th place in 1912. Attendances slumped to 15,000 and the squad started to age under the leadership of J.J. Bentley. They narrowly escaped relegation in 1914–15 by one point; three of United's players were later found to have conspired with Liverpool players in fixing a United win in the match between the sides, in the 1915 British football betting scandal. The United players were found guilty of match fixing and banned for life.\n\nThe Football League was suspended at the outbreak of the First World War, during which Sandy Turnbull was killed in France. On 28 December 1914, Jack Robson was appointed as the club's first official manager; previously, the club secretary had been responsible for the majority of matters relating to the playing of the game. Mangnall's position as secretary was first filled by T.J. Wallworth, then by Bentley, under whom Robson worked. No football was played during the war, which meant that the club was not generating any revenue, but the club had to continue to pay for the running of Old Trafford, and as such the financial situation worsened. Bentley died in September 1918, two months before the end of the war and a year before the resumption of league football.\n\nAt the end of the 1921–22 season, Manchester United were relegated to the Second Division, having won only eight games. United finally returned to the top flight under John Chapman in 1925, finishing second to Leicester City. In October 1927, John Henry Davies, who had saved the club from extinction and brought them to Old Trafford, died and was replaced by G.H. Lawton as club president. On 7 October 1926, the Football Association announced that Chapman had been suspended from \"taking part in football or football management\" during the 1926–27 season \"For improper conduct in his position as Secretary-Manager of the Manchester United Football Club\" and was replaced for the rest of the season by experienced player Lal Hilditch.\n\nA new manager, Herbert Bamlett was installed, but the club never finished higher than 12th in 1929 and finally finishing bottom of the First Division in 1931 after starting the season losing twelve times in a row. The finances were once again in a mess, and the much criticised Herbert Bamlett resigned. Secretary Walter Crickmer was given control of the team for the next season, and was aided by chief scout Louis Rocca, largely because the club couldn't afford a new manager. The players had gone to collect their wages just before Christmas and were told there was no money available. Another financial bailout was needed. They managed to finish mid table in the Second Division in 1931–32, despite losing 7–0 at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Boxing Day 1931, but with the club's finances precarious it seemed possible that the club could go out of business.\n\nA new investor, James W. Gibson, arrived in December 1931. He was approached by a Manchester sportswriter, Stacey Lintott. He met with the board and offered to help on condition that he became chairman and could choose his directors. They had little choice but to agree, and Gibson invested £30,000 into the club. A new manager was found, Scott Duncan, one of the new breed of managers who were retired players, now common, but an innovation in those days.\n\nIn 1934, United reached their lowest ever league position. On the final day of the season they were placed second-last in the table with their final match away against Millwall, who were one point ahead. With destiny in their own hands, they beat Millwall 2–0 and stayed in the Second Division by one point, sending their South London hosts down.\n\nThe next season saw an improvement with the side winning ten out of eleven games during October and November 1934. It seemed things were back on track and the fans started to flock back to Old Trafford as United finished fifth, just falling short of promotion. After five years in the Second Division, they finished champions in 1936 after being unbeaten in the last 19 games of the season and were promoted back to the First Division. The title was won with a 3–2 victory at Bury, where over 31,000 fans invaded the pitch to celebrate a return to the big time.\n\nTheir joy was short-lived, however, as they were relegated back to the Second Division the next season. Scott Duncan resigned, and Crickmer resumed the manager's chair. Although now £70,000 in debt, United picked themselves up and finished runners-up in 1938, returning to the First Division, with future stars such as Johnny Carey, Jack Rowley and Stan Pearson. They would stay there for 36 years; after finishing 14th the next season, World War II broke out.\n\nUpon the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, association football was effectively frozen, and Old Trafford was requisitioned by the military to be used as a depot. Football continued to be played at the stadium, but a German bombing raid on Trafford Park on 22 December 1940 damaged the stadium to the extent that a Christmas Day fixture against Stockport County had to be switched to Stockport's ground. Football resumed at Old Trafford on 8 March 1941, but another German raid on 11 March 1941 destroyed much of the stadium, notably the main stand (now the South Stand), forcing the club's operations to move to Cornbrook Cold Storage, owned by United chairman James W. Gibson. After pressure from Gibson, the War Damage Commission granted Manchester United £4,800 to remove the debris and £17,478 to rebuild the stands, although rebuilding work did not resume until after the war ended in 1945. During the reconstruction of the stadium, Manchester United played their \"home\" games at Maine Road, the home of Manchester City, at a cost of £5,000 a year plus a percentage of the gate receipts.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1949760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949760", "title": "Bureau de change", "text": "Bureau de change\n\nA bureau de change (plural bureaux de change, both ) (British English) or currency exchange (American English) is a business where people can exchange one currency for another.\n\nAlthough originally French, the term \"bureau de change\" is widely used throughout Europe and French Speaking Canada, where it is common to find a sign saying \"exchange\" or \"change\". Since the adoption of the euro, many exchange offices incorporate its logotype prominently on their signage.\n\nIn the United States and English-speaking Canada the business is described as \"currency exchange\" and sometimes \"money exchange\", sometimes with various additions such as \"foreign\", \"desk\", \"office\", \"counter\", \"service\", etc.; for example, \"foreign currency exchange office\".\n\nA bureau de change is often located at a bank, at a travel agent, airport, main railway station or large stores—namely, anywhere there is likely to be a market for people needing to convert currency. They are particularly prominent at travel hubs, although currency can be exchanged in many other ways both legally and illegally in other venues. Some of the major players include HSBC, Travelex, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo, and Bank of America.\n\nA bureau de change is a business which, in competition with other similar businesses, makes its profit by buying foreign currency and then selling the same currency at a higher exchange rate. It may also charge commission or fee on the purchase or sale. In setting its exchange rates, the business would keep an eye on changing market conditions as well as the rates quoted by competitors, and may be subject to government foreign exchange controls and other regulations.\n\nThe exchange rates charged at bureaux are generally related to the spot prices available for large interbank transactions, and are adjusted to ensure a profit. The rate at which a bureau will buy currency differs from that at which it will sell it; for every currency it trades both will be on display, generally in the shop window.\n\nSo the bureau sells at a lower rate from that at which it buys. For example, a UK bureau may sell €1.40 for £1 but buy €1.60 for £1. Quite often the terms \"buy\" and \"sell\" are used the other way round by a bureau de change, and the buy rate may seem higher that the sell rate: in such cases it means \"we buy/sell our local currency at the rate showed\" (examples from Google Images).\n\nSo if the spot price on a particular day is €1.50 to £1, in theory £2 will buy €3, but in practice this would be hard if not impossible for average consumers to get. If the bureau de change buys £1 from a consumer for €1.40 and then sells £1 for €1.60, the 20 pence difference contributes to expenses and profit. \n\nThis business model can be upset by a currency run when there are far more buyers than sellers (or vice versa) because they feel a particular currency is overvalued or undervalued.\n\nThe business may also charge a commission on the transaction. Commission is generally charged as a percentage of the amount to be exchanged, or a fixed fee, or both. Some bureaux do not charge commission but may adjust their offered exchange rates. Some bureaux offer special deals for customers returning unspent foreign currency after a holiday. Bureaux de change rarely buy or sell coins, but sometimes will at a higher profit margin, justifying this by the higher cost of storage and shipping compared with banknotes.\nIn recent years together with emergence of online banking, currency exchange services have appeared on the Internet. This new model allows more competitive exchange rates and threatens traditional bricks-and-mortar bureaux de change. Online currency exchange has two main models: the more popular model is provided by an established bureau de change, while social currency exchange platforms such as WeSwap allows participants to ask or bid for currency at their own rates (usually with an additional transaction fee).\n\nThe business model of traditional money changers is coming under threat by many new innovative fintech start-ups offering e-wallet foreign exchange alternatives that offer low or no currency exchange transaction fees.\n\nIt is estimated that the total revenue of this industry is 362 billion $ \n\nThe rise of peer to peer foreign currency exchange platforms and FinTech has led to disruptive p2p forex platforms that significantly undercuts traditional banks and financial institutions. Providers that use the p2p model to satisfy offsetting currency demands without an intermediary (such as a broker) has result in significant margin and spread compression in the foreign exchange business model.\n\nChanging money at a bureau is often more expensive than withdrawing it from an automatic teller machine at one's destination or paying directly by debit or credit card, but this varies depending on the card issuer and the type of account. Fees from multiple ATM withdrawals should also be considered. Some people may feel uncomfortable carrying a lot of cash and so prefer to use a card and carry minimal cash for tipping cabs, hotels, and restaurants. Hotels and rental cars many times also need cards for temporary holds.\n\nSome may also prefer to hold foreign currency rather than change it back if they are expecting to return to where it is used. Companies that frequently send employees abroad may essentially act as their own exchange by reimbursing their employees in the local currency and holding the foreign currency. If exchange rates are relatively stable, the fees charged by a bureau may exceed any likely fluctuation and it also makes the company's accountancy easier.\n\nIn the alternate, some prefer to buy their currency before they travel, either just for a sense of security against credit card fraud typically achieved by tampered card readers or hackers, or because they speculate the exchange rate is better at that time than it will be when they make their trip. As well, some places may only take cash or have credit card terminals down.\n\nIn 2002, many bureaux reported substantial reductions in profit due to the replacement of many European currencies with the euro.\n\nBureaux de change offer an opportunity for money laundering, and a number of countries require bureaux de change to register as money service businesses and are subject to their anti-money laundering measures. The Financial Action Task Force offers a set of recommendations for money services businesses to identify risky customers and transactions, however it is up to the various regulatory authorities to set out the specific regulations that govern the money services businesses in different countries.\n\n"}

She was the flagship of Vice-Admiral Latouche Tréville, who died on board on 18 August 1804.\n\"Bucentaure\" was named after the mighty Venetian ship \"Bucentaur\" which was destroyed by Napoleon I after the fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797. Vice-Admiral Villeneuve hoisted his flag on 6 November 1804. \"Bucentaure\" hosted the Franco-Spanish war council while sheltered from the British fleet at Cadiz. The vote was to remain in safe waters (a decision later overruled by Admiral Villeneuve) During the council, Spanish general Escaño complained that the atmospheric pressure was descending (a sign of approaching storms). French vice-admiral Magon famously retorted \"the thing descending here is braveness\". This offended Admiral Gravina and other Spanish officers who did not oppose later the imprudent order of taking to sea.\n\nAt the Battle of Trafalgar, on 21 October 1805, she was commanded by Captain Jean-Jacques Magendie. Admiral Nelson's HMS \"Victory\", leading the weather column of the British fleet, broke the French line just astern of \"Bucentaure\" and just ahead of \"Redoutable\". \"Victory\" raked her less-protected stern and the vessel lost 197 men and 85 were wounded (including Captain Magendie); Admiral Villeneuve was lucky to survive, but this effectively put \"Bucentaure\" out of most of the fight. After three hours of fighting, she surrendered to Captain James Atcherly of the Marines from HMS \"Conqueror.\n\nVilleneuve is supposed to have asked to whom he was surrendering. On being told it was Captain Pellew, he replied, \"There is no shame in surrendering to the gallant Sir Edward Pellew.\" When he was informed that the \"Conqueror\"'s captain (Israel Pellew) was Sir Edward's brother, he said, \"England is fortunate to have two such brothers.\"\n\nIn the following days, \"Bucentaure\"'s crew rose up against the British prize crew and recaptured the ship. However, she was wrecked in the gale-force storm of 23 October 1805.\n\n\n"}

Dryden reportedly wrote the play in only seven weeks.\n\nNell Gwyn played the tyrant's daughter Valeria, and spoke \"what must be the most amusing epilogue ever written\" (in the words of Maximillian E.

Known for his interviews with politicians, royalty and film stars in a career spanning more than 50 years, he was widely regarded as a very important figure in his field, and was both the first Irishman to get a jet across the Atlantic Ocean to New York in 1958 and the only western journalist to have interviewed Che Guevara. Considered a \"master of executing international scoops\", his work was sent across the world.\n\nQuinlan came from Dublin but was raised in Quin, County Clare. He attended University College Dublin (UCD), where he studied English literature and history and edited two student publications.\n\nQuinlan began working with \"The Irish Times\" in 1945. He was formerly based at Shannon Airport. Shannon is the most westerly airport in Europe and an important fuel stop for both eastward and westward traffic. Quinlan would simply start up his 1939 Morris 8 and head for the airport. He interviewed every United States President from Harry Truman to George H. W. Bush and many Soviet leaders, including Andrey Vyshinsky and Andrei Gromyko. \n\nHe once said,\"I interviewed many royals including the Duke Of Edinburgh, Princess Margaret, King Michael of Romania and his mother, Queen Maria, King Peter of Yugoslavia, King Zog of Albania, King Ibn Saud, founder of Saudi Arabia, Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, Queen Wilhelmina and Queen Juliana of Holland and that lovely couple Prince Rainier and his wife, the former Grace Kelly.\"\n\nWhen Captain Charles Lindbergh's son was kidnapped Quinlan interviewed him. A 4 am interview with George H. W. Bush on the Middle East left U.S. journalists perplexed as to why an Irish ‘stringer’ had managed to get hold of such a story.\n\nQuinlan taught Fidel Castro how to make an Irish coffee and was the only western journalist to have interviewed Che Guevara. Guevara talked of his Irish connections through the name Lynch. He told Quinlan of his grandmother's Irish roots in Galway. Later, Che, and some of his Cuban comrades, went to Limerick and adjourned to Hanratty's Hotel on Glentworth Street.

The island, jointly owned by the United States Coast Guard and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is Ohio's only designated Wilderness Area, the West Sister Island National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nMost of the island is covered with trees. Tall hackberry trees make up most of the canopy, with poison ivy on the ground. Polygonatum and a great variety of ferns, wildflowers, mushrooms, and other plant life can also be found.\n\nThe island is part of the Pelee Archipelago which also includes East Sister Island and Middle Sister Island (both in Ontario, Canada). West Sister Island is roughly 13 miles west of Rattlesnake Island, 14.5 miles east of Turtle Island, and 8.75 miles due north of the Ohio mainland.\n\nA lighthouse was established on the westernmost point of West Sister Island in 1848 to mark the west end of the South Passage through Lake Erie's Bass Islands. Standing on a stone foundation, the limestone and brick tower rises to a height of . The West Sister Island Lighthouse is still an active aid to navigation, and is one of the oldest lighthouses to survive on the Great Lakes.\n\nIronically, after being established as a wildlife refuge in 1937, the island was used by the United States Army for artillery practice during World War II. Although the wildlife population and the lighthouse were not significantly damaged, the keeper's house was destroyed. It is also reported that fuel tanks jettisoned by dive bombers can still be found on the island.\n\nWest Sister Island was a popular stop for bootleggers during Prohibition. The island provided a certain level of visual cover from the authorities for rum runners crossing the lake. When approached by these authorities, bootleggers would often dump their illegal stash overboard. Legend has it that bottles of prohibition-era alcohol can still be found on the bottom of the lake around the island.\n\nWest Sister Island was once rumored to be the final resting place of missing Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa. It was speculated that after his abduction in Detroit, he was brought by boat to the island and buried. The island's jungle-like environment would have made discovery of his remains difficult; however these conditions would also have made the deposit of his remains difficult, therefore the island is not one of the more widely considered possibilities in the case.\n\nThe West Sister Island National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1937 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt \"as a refuge and breeding ground for migratory birds and other wildlife...,\" specifically designated to protect the largest wading bird nesting colony on the U.S. Great Lakes. The refuge is managed by the staff of the Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge as a wilderness area, as provided under the Federal Wilderness Act. To protect it, public access is permitted for research only.\n\nThe refuge, which has a surface area of 80.13 acres (0.3243 km² or 32.43 ha), was recognized in 2000 as part of a globally Important Bird Area.\n\nThe wildlife refuge was featured in a 2007 episode of the Discovery Channel TV series \"Dirty Jobs\" with Mike Rowe. Due to the large number of birds vomiting and defecating from high in the trees the island is referred to as \"Vomit Island\" in the program.\n\nIn the animated television series \"Transformers Animated\", the Dinobots reside in refuge on an island called \"North Sister Island\", located in Lake Erie, a fictional reference to West Sister Island.\n\n\n"}

The show, which originated at WDRE and then on Y100, both in Philadelphia, features daily telephone interviews, in-studio guests, celebrity impersonations, unusual news stories, and numerous sound clips and running gags. It broadcasts live on the radio as well as streaming audio via the station website from 6 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. EST, Monday through Friday, and is a featured podcast in the comedy section of the iTunes Store.\n\nPreston Elliot, Steve Morrison and Marilyn Russell were among a group of radio personalities introduced to the Philadelphia market through the now defunct radio station WDRE. With several of their WDRE co-workers, they departed the station for Y100 in 1997 when WDRE changed format. After four successful years of (then known as) \"The Y100 Morning Show with Preston, Marilyn, and Steve\", Marilyn Russell left the morning show on March 1, 2002, for family reasons. She has worked part-time on many stations in the Philadelphia area since then, including WMGK, and SoJo 104.9, WYSP, and joined morning personality Dave Cruise as co-host on \"The BENFM Morning Show on 95.7 in 2007.\n\nWPLY's owner, Dan Lerner, one of the last independent owners in the Philadelphia market, sold the station to Radio One, a national broadcasting corporation, in 2001. Coincidentally, Radio One was the same group that bought Preston, Marilyn & Steve's previous radio station 103.9 WDRE. Radio One and hosts Elliot and Morrison did not successfully negotiate a new contract, and the personalities agreed to a deal with local broadcasting group Greater Media. The hosts' contract with Radio One expired on February 24, 2005, and Y100 changed format and became WPHI \"The Beat\" at 11:50 p.m. EDT that same day.\n\nA legal battle between Radio One and the Elliot and Morrison team over the hosts' non-compete clause was resolved by a ruling that they were no longer in competition with WPLY. Their new show officially debuted on the air on Monday, May 23, 2005.\n\nIn 2006, Elliot and Morrison received a long-term contract extension and in 2008, the station gave them a new studio with their own production equipment. They signed another multi-year deal in 2011.\n\nIn April 2019 the Preston and Steve show signed an extension with Beasley Broadcast Group, the current owners of WMMR. The terms of the contract were not revealed but were described as a multi-year extension.\n\nThe show has been named the \"Best Morning Show\" by \"Philadelphia Style\" magazine, and \"Personality/Show of the Year\" in the active rock category by Radio & Records trade magazine. Before switching to WMMR, the show won various Philadelphia A.I.R. Awards, including the \"Best Weekday Morning Team\" award for 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2005, and was voted best local morning show in the country in FMQB's Year End Leaders Poll for 2004 and 2005 in two different formats.\n\nIn the Summer 2004 Arbitron ratings book, the show was rated fourth in market share for all people ages 18–34, and second for men in the same category. The \"Preston & Steve\" show's ratings surpassed Howard Stern's during his last month on the air, and they outranked each of David Lee Roth's, Opie and Anthony's, and Kidd Chris's tenures at WYSP. , \"Preston & Steve\" was the top rated show in Philadelphia, and over a four-year period, they had the #1 show in the Arbitron ratings for the 25–54 adult demographic a total of 42 times.\n\nIn 2014, Elliot and Morrison were nominated by the National Association of Broadcasters as finalists for the NAB Marconi Radio Awards for Major Market Personality of the Year.\n\nOn June 11 2019, Elliot and Morrison were honored by The National Association of Broadcasters Leadership Foundation, receiving the 2019 Service to Community Award in acknowledgement of the Camp Out for Hunger.\n\nSince 1998, the show has held an annual Camp Out For Hunger, in which both Elliot and Morrison \"camp out\" (i.e., live in a motorhome) for one week in November to raise food for Philabundance. The show awards prizes to individuals and groups that donate the most food. Since 1998, the event has raised hundreds of tons to feed the hungry across the Delaware Valley.\n\nResults\nTo celebrate the anticipated 10,000th loss in Philadelphia Phillies franchise history, executive producer Nick McIlwain rolled 10,000 marbles down the steps of the Philadelphia Art Museum as Bill Weston (WMMR's program director) looked on. After being cleaned up by the show's production crew, the marbles were donated to Toys for Tots and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\nIn 2006, Elliot had a slip of the tongue while trying to say \"awesome\" and instead said \"office\". Later that year they announced that they would be releasing a calendar featuring one (sometimes two) woman a month. Lauren Harris had been the only woman to appear in the calendar every year, until the 2015 calendar, when other commitments kept her from participating (she will be returning in the 2016 calendar). Release of the Calendar is typically accompanied by a \"Totally Office Calendar Party\", which can draw thousands of participants to see the women depicted in the Calendar in person and receive signed copies of the Calendar.\n\nThis annual is hosted by \"Preston & Steve\" in coordination with the American Red Cross. The event typically attracts a very large crowd, and various promotional items and free concert tickets are often given out. The 2011 (6th annual) blood drive collected a total of 1,174 units of blood, and gives them a 6-year total of 6,409 units. The 2016 (11th annual) drive collected a total of 1,297 units of blood.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1949793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949793", "title": "Surface forces apparatus", "text": "Surface forces apparatus\n\nThe Surface Force Apparatus (SFA) is a scientific instrument which measures the interaction force of two surfaces as they are brought together and retracted using multiple beam interferometry to monitor surface separation and directly measure contact area and observe any surface deformations occurring in the contact zone. One surface is held by a cantilevered spring, and the deflection of the spring is used to calculate the force being exerted. The technique was pioneered by D. Tabor, R.H.S. Winterton in the late 1960s at Cambridge University. By the mid-1970s, J.N. Israelachvili had adapted the original design to operate in liquids, notably aqueous solutions, while at the Australian National University, and further advanced the technique to support friction and electro-chemical surface studies while at the University of California Santa Barbara.\n\nA Surface Force Apparatus uses piezoelectric positioning elements (in addition to conventional motors for coarse adjustments), and senses the distance between the surfaces using optical interferometry. Using these sensitive elements, the device can resolve distances to within 0.1 nanometer, and forces at the 10 N level. This extremely sensitive technique can be used to measure electrostatic forces, elusive van der Waals forces, and even hydration or solvation forces. SFA is in some ways similar to using an atomic force microscope to measure interaction between a tip (or molecule adsorbed onto the tip) and a surface. The SFA, however, is more ideally suited to measuring surface-surface interactions, can measure much longer-range forces more accurately, and is well-suited to situations where long relaxation times play a role (ordering, high-viscosity, corrosion). The SFA technique is quite demanding, nevertheless, labs worldwide have adopted the technique as part of their surface science research instrumentation.\n\nIn the SFA, method two smooth cylindrically curved surfaces whose cylindrical axes are positioned at 90° to each other are made to approach each other in a direction normal to the axes. The distance between the surfaces at the point of closest approach varies between a few micrometers to a few nanometers depending on the apparatus. When the two curved cylinders have the same radius of curvature, \"R\", this so-called 'crossed cylinders' geometry is mathematically equivalent to the interaction between a flat surface and a sphere of radius \"R\". Using the crossed cylinder geometry makes alignment much easier, enables testing of many different surface regions for better statistics, and also enables angle-dependent measurements to be taken. A typical setup involves \"R\" = 1 cm.\n\nPosition measurements are typically made using multiple beam interferometry (MBI). The transparent surfaces of the perpendicular cylinders, usually mica, are backed with a highly reflective material usually silver before being mounted to the glass cylinders. When a white-light source is shined normal to the perpendicular cylinders the light will reflect back and forth until it is transmitted at where the surfaces are closest. These rays create an interference pattern, known as fringes of equal chromatic order (FECO), which can be observed by microscope. Distance between the two surfaces can be determined by analyzing these patterns. Mica is used because it is extremely flat, easy to work with, and optically transparent. Any other material or molecule of interest can be coated or adsorbed onto the mica layer.\n\nIn the jump method, the top cylinder is mounted to a pair of cantilever springs, while the bottom cylinder is brought up towards the top cylinder. While the bottom cylinder approaches the top, there comes a point when they will \"jump\" into contact with each other. The measurements, in this case, are based on the distance from which they jump and the spring constant. These measurements are usually between surfaces 1.25 nm and 20 nm apart.\n\nThe jump method is difficult to execute mainly due to unaccounted vibrations entering the instrument. To overcome this, researchers developed the resonance method which measured surface forces at larger distances, 10 nm to 130 nm. In this case, the bottom cylinder is oscillated at a known frequency, while the frequency of the top cylinder is measured using a piezoelectric bimorph strain gauge. To minimize the dampening due to the surrounding substance, these measurements were originally done in a vacuum.\n\nEarly experiments measured the force between mica surfaces in air or vacuum. The technique has been extended, however, to enable an arbitrary vapor or solvent to be introduced between the two surfaces. In this way, interactions in various media can be carefully probed, and the dielectric constant of the gap between the surfaces can be tuned. Moreover, use of water as a solvent enables the measurement of interactions between biological molecules (such as lipids in biological membranes or proteins) in their native environment. In a solvent environment, SFA can even measure the oscillatory solvation and structural forces arising from the packing of individual layers of solvent molecules. It can also measure the electrostatic 'double layer' forces between charged surfaces in an aqueous medium with electrolyte.\n\nThe SFA has more recently been extended to perform dynamic measurements, thereby determining viscous and viscoelastic properties of fluids, frictional and tribological properties of surfaces, and the time-dependent interaction between biological structures.\n\nThe force measurements of the SFA are based primarily on Hooke's Law,\n\nformula_1\n\nwhere F is the restoring force of a spring, k is the spring constant and x is the displacement of the spring.\n\nUsing a cantilevered spring, the lower surface is brought towards the top surface using a fine micrometer or piezotube. The force between the two surfaces is measured by\n\nformula_2\n\nwhere formula_3is the change in displacement applied by the micrometer and formula_4 is the change displacement measured by interferometry.\n\nThe spring constants can range anywhere from formula_5 to formula_6. When measuring higher forces, a spring with a higher spring constant would be used.\n\n\n"}

Set in Roman Britain during the 5th century, it is the story of a British Roman's life after the final withdrawal of Roman troops (around 410). Sutcliff won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject.\n\n\"Lantern Bearers\" is the third of four books sometimes catalogued as the Marcus series (1954 to 1963), inaugurated by \"The Eagle of the Ninth\". At the same time it is the fourth of eight books sometimes called the \"Eagle of the Ninth\" series (1954 to 1997). Its themes are more complex than in the first two Marcus books. Issues of loss, estrangement, and loyalty are more complicated, pulling main characters in conflicting directions. Reviewers tend to regard it as appropriate for a slightly older readership than its predecessors. On the other hand, it is \"officially a children's book\" while its sequel \"Sword at Sunset\" is \"officially an adult book\". According to Sutcliff, \"my books are for children of all ages, from nine to ninety.\" Within the loosely connected \"Eagle of the Ninth\" series, \"The Lantern Bearers\" is first of the specifically \"Arthurian\" works. In the sequel, beginning three days later, the viewpoint shifts from Aquila to Arthur.\n\nThe title is from a remark by one of the characters, Eugenus the Physician, \"We are the lantern bearers, my friend; for us to keep something burning, to carry what light we can forward into the darkness and the wind.\" The effort to maintain what the protagonists see as the light of civilisation against Saxon barbarians is central to the plot of the book.\n\nThe story is set during the turbulent years following the withdrawal of the last Roman troops from Britain. The land is reeling under the onslaught of Saxon raiders, the Pict War and a slave revolt. Vortigern, the British-Celtic chieftain, has invited Hengest the Saxon and his tribe to fight the Picts, and relies on Roman soldiers to hold the Saxons in check. Rome is increasingly under threat from the barbarian hordes surrounding it on all sides and cannot afford to deal with the problems of a distant province.\n\n18-year-old Aquila, descendant of Marcus Flavius Aquila, is a Decurion of Roman cavalry, serving in the Auxiliary legion at Rutupiae. The story begins when Aquila is home on leave at the family farm in the Downs, with his blind father Flavian, younger sister Flavia and trusted servants who have served his family for years. The few remaining Romans, including Aquila's father Flavian, look upon Ambrosius Aurelianus, the descendant of a Welsh princess and a Roman soldier, as the last hope of Britain. Aquila is hastily recalled to Rutupiae where he is informed that all Roman troops will be withdrawing from Britain in three days on orders from Rome. Caught by surprise, Aquila struggles between loyalty to his duty and attachment with his homeland. At the last minute, he decides that he belongs to Britain and not Rome and so deserts the army. As the last of the legions sail away, he lights the beacon at Rutupiae for the last time.\n\nHe returns home, only to have the farm attacked by a raiding party of Saxons two days later. In the skirmish, Aquila kills the leader of the band but is soon overpowered by the many assailants. He is forced to watch while a tall blond giant carries away Flavia forcibly. The raiders kill everyone else on the farm and burn down everything. Aquila is left tied to a tree for the wolves as revenge for killing the Saxon.\n\nThe Saxons are followed by a band of Jutish raiders, who find Aquila and take him to Jutland. Aquila spends nearly 3 years as a slave, during which time he learns that the Saxons who murdered his family and destroyed his home were no chance band of raiders but sent there by Hengest as revenge on Flavian and others who had dared to write to Consul Aetius in Rome pleading for help against Vortigern and the Saxons. Flavian had been betrayed by a bird-catcher who used to carry messages between the Roman plotters. Often tormented by visions of his sister screaming for help, Aquila bides his time for the day he can return, find his sister and take revenge on the bird-catcher.\n\nBad harvests force the Jutes to accept Hengest's invitation to settle in Britain. Aquila sails with them and returns to Britain only to find Rutupiae forsaken and devastated. With the Romans gone and Vortigern too powerless to resist, Hengest has free run of the land. Aquila is plotting his escape from the Saxon camp when he chances upon Flavia, who is now married to the man who abducted her and has a year-old child by him. She helps him escape but refuses to come with him, telling him that she cannot leave her husband and child. Devastated by her apparent betrayal, Aquila leaves alone and bitter.\n\nHe stumbles upon a cheerful bee-keeping monk, Brother Ninnias, who lives by himself in a forest, the lone survivor of a Saxon raid upon his abbey. Brother Ninnias cuts away the thrall-ring around Aquila's neck and gives him food and shelter. During his stay with the monk, Aquila learns that the bird-catcher had betrayed his father only after being tortured by the Saxons and had died soon after. Denied his revenge as well as his sister, Aquila realises he no longer has a purpose in life. Brother Ninnias advises him to take up his father Flavian's cause and offer his service to the Prince of Britain, Ambrosius Aurelianius.\n\nAquila travels to Dynas Ffaraon, Ambrosius's stronghold in the Welsh mountains and is soon accepted into the prince's Inner Companions. But past hurt and bitterness makes him wary of people and he soon begins to be called 'Lone Wolf'. Ambrosius tries to unite the people of Britain – Celts and Romans alike – to fight the Saxons. He tells Aquila to marry one of the two daughters of Cradoc, a Celtic chieftain whose life Ambrosius had once saved during battle, as an alliance to unite the two peoples and Aquila chooses younger spirited Ness over the beautiful elder sister, Rhyanidd. At first Aquila is quite indifferent to Ness and she resents him for taking her away from her home and her people. As years pass by, Aquila learns to let go of his hurt and open up to others, especially after the birth of his son who he names Flavian in his father's memory.\n\nIn the years of skirmishes, uneasy truce and battles that follow, Ambrosius finally scores a decisive victory over the Saxons with the help of Artos (Arthur), his nephew, and Aquila. During the fight, Aquila sees a young dark-haired boy resembling his sister. He tries to dismiss it as his imagination but comes upon the boy lying unconscious on the road and realises that it is indeed Flavia's son. With Brother Ninnias' help, he tends to the boy's injuries, hides him from British soldiers and sends him back to his mother with a message for her. Later Aquila publicly confesses his deed to Ambrosius on the night of the banquet celebrating Ambrosius' ascension as the High King of Britain. Ambrosius listens to the whole story and forgives him. Aquila finally feels free and content even though he knows that the respite he and his people have found is only temporary and they cannot hold off the invaders from Britain forever.\n\nThe novel is set in Britain at the beginning of the Dark Ages when the once-dominant Roman empire was declining and tribes from the east began migrating into West Europe. The author uses this time period for a realistic retelling of the mythical tale of King Arthur. The next book in the series, \"Sword at Sunset\", continues the same story.\n\nArthur's supposed uncle, Ambrosius Aurelianus is seen as a remnant of the old Roman ways trying to defend his homeland against what seems to be an unstoppable invasion of foreign barbarians. The book presents several other historical-mythical figures such as Hengist and Horsa, the Saxon chiefs who invade England and Vortigern, king of Britons. Brother Ninnias could be a version of the monk Nennius, who is traditionally considered to have authored Historia Brittonum.\n\nSeveral aspects of the time period are treated sympathetically. The story juxtaposes several opposing points of view such as the resentment of the Romano-Britannic people who are being invaded by what they see as personifications of evil and darkness, and the desperate need of the continental tribes who face poor harvests and starvation in their own lands.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1949812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949812", "title": "Size zero", "text": "Size zero\n\nSize zero or size 0 is a women's clothing size in the US catalog sizes system. Size 0 and 00 were invented due to the changing of clothing sizes over time (referred to as vanity sizing or size inflation), which has caused the adoption of lower numbers. For example, a 2011 size 0 is equivalent to a 2001 size 2, and is larger than a 1970 size 6 or 1958 size 8. Modern size 0 clothing, depending on brand and style, fits measurements of chest-stomach-hips from 30-22-32 inches (76-56-81 cm) to 36-28-36 inches (90-71½-90 cm). Size 00 can be anywhere from 0.5 to 2 inches (1 to 5 cm) smaller than size 0. Size zero often refers to extremely thin individuals (especially women and adolescent girls), or trends associated with them.\n\nThe use of size 0 in advertisements and products of the clothing industry has been met with some media attention. In July 2009, Katie Green won a competition to represent Wonderbra. They referred her to the Premier Model Management agency for representation. Green reported that \"one of the guys from the PR agency from Wonderbra\" insisted that she lose weight, that it wasn't normal for models to be a (UK) size 8. \"Unless I could drop down to that weight, they wouldn't be willing to get me more work.\" Green at first complied, but then quit the agency. She then, with Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Öpik, launched a campaign titled \"Say No to Size Zero\". They began a petition drive with the goal to put an end to size zero and underweight models on the catwalk or working in the fashion industry. They set a goal to obtain 20,000 signatures and plan to present it to the UK Prime Minister and Parliament. They are campaigning for legislation that would require regular health checkups for all models before undertaking any assignments.\n\nAfter the death of Luisel Ramos from anorexia in August, 2006, Madrid Fashion Week banned size zero models the following month, and the Milan fashion show took the same action shortly afterward, banning models with a body mass index (BMI) of 18 or below. As a result, five models were banned from taking part.\n\nAs of 2007, the British Fashion Council promoted the creation of a task force to establish guidelines for the fashion industry. They also urged fashion designers to use healthy models. In September 2019, Victoria Beckham received criticism on social media over thin models who appeared \"ill\" in her Fall fashion show. In 2015 she had \"vowed that her agents were in touch with the agents of all the models she uses in an effort to make sure that the women are healthy\". Representatives for Beckham did not respond to Fox News’s request for comment.\n\nItalian fashion labels Prada, Versace and Armani have agreed to ban size zero models from their catwalks. Under the new self-regulation code drawn up in Italy by the government and designers, all models in future shows will be \"full-bodied\", and larger sizes will be introduced at shows. Fashion designer Giorgio Armani has given support to the effort to eliminate ultra-thin models. \"The time has now come for clarity. We all need to work together against anorexia.\"\n\nIsrael banned underweight models in March 2012. Their law stipulates that women and men hired as models must be certified by a physician as having a body mass index (BMI) of no less than 18.5. The legislation also requires the inclusion of an informational note in adverts using photos manipulated to make models look thinner. There were divergent views on the ban within the Israeli fashion industry. One modelling agent, who had helped promote the bill, suggested that the fall in typical dress sizes for models in the preceding 15–20 years amounted to \"the difference between death and life\". However, another described the law as \"arbitrary\" and \"not appropriate for every model\".\n\n"}

Any real-world thing mapped to an appropriate class type can be described by the attributes defined in the standard, and the methods defined therewith allow operations to be performed on the attributes. The attributes and methods constitute an object. Conventionally, the first attribute in an object is the logical name, also defined as the OBIS code in case of LN referencing. It is one part of the identification of the object. Objects that share common characteristics are generalized as instantiations of an interface class with defined class_id. Instantiations of an interface class are called COSEM objects. IEC 62056-62 defines nineteen interface classes for COSEM object model.\n\nIEC 61107 or currently IEC 62056-21, was an international standard for a computer protocol to read utility meters. It is designed to operate over any media, including the Internet. A meter sends ASCII (in modes A..D) or HDLC (mode E) data to a nearby hand-held unit (HHU) using a serial port. The physical media are usually either modulated light, sent with an LED and received with a photodiode, or a pair of wires, usually modulated by a 20mA current loop. The protocol is usually half-duplex.\n\nThe following exchange usually takes a second or two, and occurs when a person from the utility company presses a meter-reading gun against a transparent faceplate on the meter, or plugs into the metering bus at the mailbox of an apartment building.\n\nThe general protocol consists of a \"sign on\" sequence, in which a handheld unit identifies itself to the metering unit. During sign-on, the handheld unit addresses a particular meter by number. The meter and hand-held unit negotiate various parameters such as the maximum frame length during transmission and reception, whether multiple frames can be sent without acknowledging individual frames (windowing), the fastest communication rate that they can both manage (only in case of mode E switching to HDLC) etc.\n\nNext, the meter informs the handheld unit about the various parameters that are available with it in various security settings viz. the 'no-security logical group', ' the low-security logical groups' and ' the high-security logical groups'.\n\nIf the parameter required is in the no-security group, just a get.request will provide the HHU with the desired response. If the parameter required is in the low-security group, a password authentication of the HHU is required before information can be read.\n\nIn case of high-security parameters, the meter challenges the handheld unit with a cryptographic password. The handheld unit must return an encrypted password. If the password exchange is correct, the meter accepts the handheld unit: it is \"signed on.\"\n\nAfter signing on, the handheld unit generally reads a meter description. This describes some registers that describe the current count of metered units (i.e. kilowatt hours, megajoules, litres of gas or water) and the metering unit's reliability (is it still operating correctly?). Occasionally a manufacturer will define a new quantity to measure, and in this case, a new or different data type will appear in the meter definition. Most metering units have special modes for calibration and resetting meter registers. These modes are usually protected by anti-tampering features such as switches that sense if the meter enclosure has been opened.\n\nThe HHU may also be given limited rights to set or reset certain parameters in the meter.\n\nThe handheld unit then sends a sign-off message. If no sign-off message is sent, the meter automatically signs off after a previously negotiated time interval after the last message.\n\n\n"}

The verse occurs in the section introducing John the Baptist with this verse describing his baptisms.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 3:6.\n\nThe use of the word baptism to describe what John is doing is controversial. Anabaptists assert that the only proper translation for the Greek verb \"baptizmo\" is \"immerse\". They thus practice baptisms where the entire body is immersed in water, rather than just a sprinkling of water as is done in most other Christian churches. Most non-Baptist scholars do agree that John the Baptist was probably immersing those that came to see him, but they disagree that this is the only valid form of baptism.\n\nFrance notes that while in Luke and Mark John's baptisms have the power to forgive sins in Matthew they are merely confessed. France argues that in the Gospel of Matthew forgiveness of sins only becomes possible after Jesus' resurrection, a theology not held by the other synoptics. The wording of this verse gives no guidance to the Protestant/Catholic dispute over whether the act of baptism cleanses one of sins, or if it merely symbolizes that a person has already been cleansed by God. Similarly the verse is unclear on what role confession plays in the process.\n\nThe origins of John's baptism ritual are much discussed amongst scholars. Hill notes that various forms of baptism were practiced throughout the Jewish world at this time, but that only those of John the Baptist and Qumran are eschatological. This has many scholars to propose a link between the Baptist and those who wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls. There were still important difference between the baptisms of the Essenes and that of John. In Qumran baptism was a part of a regular ritual for those already purified. In John and in Christianity it is a one time event with transformative powers.\n"}
{"id": "1949842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949842", "title": "Miramichi Bay", "text": "Miramichi Bay\n\nMiramichi Bay is an estuary located on the west coast of the Gulf of St. Lawrence in New Brunswick, at the mouth of the Miramichi River. Miramichi Bay is separated into the \"inner bay\" and the \"outer bay\", with the division being a line of uninhabited barrier islands which are continually reshaped by ocean storms. The largest of these islands is the uninhabited Portage Island, which was broken in two during a violent storm in the 1950s. The islands provide some protection to the inner bay from ocean storms in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.\n\nMiramichi Bay was named by Jacques Cartier in 1534.\n\nThe Inner Miramichi Bay, and the lower portions of its tributary rivers (including the Miramichi River), are parts of a drowned river valley system. Since deglaciation, sea level rise in Miramichi Bay has flooded the mouths of these rivers with saltwater. The flooded, meandering, ancient Miramichi river channel forms a navigable route through the Inner Bay for ocean-going ships entering the port at Miramichi (formerly the ports of Chatham and Newcastle). The inner bay measures only 4 m deep on average, with the navigation channel measuring only 6–10 m. Since dredging maintenance of this channel has stopped, the port is now only accessible to ships with a shallow draft.\n\nThe estuary is a highly dynamic environment, subject to high freshwater outflows during the spring freshet, low outflow and rising saltwater content during the summer period, fall ocean storms and nor'easters which reshape the barrier islands and the old river channel, and winter sea ice which encases the entire estuary. The shallow inner bay warms rapidly during summer. The diurnal tide cycle ranges only 1 m on average. Continued sea level rise is very slowly inundating adjacent low-lying areas and promoting rapid erosion of the low sandstone cliffs bordering the bay.\n\nThe estuary is significant in that it is a highly productive ecosystem, despite its relatively small size. The estuary receives the freshwater discharge from the Miramichi River and its tributaries, giving local waters somewhat lower salinity. Organic materials from the surrounding shorelines and inflowing rivers contribute, together with the warm water, to the bay's high productivity.\n\nMarine life includes harbour seals, herring gulls, the common tern (\"pictars\" to use the old Scottish word), the great blue heron (commonly called \"crane\" in the Miramichi), the common loon, and cormorants (called \"black shag\" locally), with kingfishers, plovers, snipe and killdeer along the shore.\n"}
{"id": "1949844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949844", "title": "Culture of Tonga", "text": "Culture of Tonga\n\nThe Tongan archipelago has been inhabited for perhaps 3000 years, since settlement in late Lapita times. The culture of its inhabitants has surely changed greatly over this long time period. Before the arrival of European explorers in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the Tongans were in frequent contact with their nearest Oceanic neighbors, Fiji and Samoa. In the 19th century, with the arrival of Western traders and missionaries, Tongan culture changed dramatically. Some old beliefs and habits were thrown away and others adopted. Some accommodations made in the 19th century and early 20th century are now being challenged by changing Western civilization. Hence Tongan culture is far from a unified or monolithic affair, and Tongans themselves may differ strongly as to what it is \"Tongan\" to do, or not do.\n\nContemporary Tongans often have strong ties to overseas lands. They may have been migrant workers in New Zealand, or have lived and traveled in New Zealand, Australia, or the United States. Many Tongans now live overseas, in a Tongan diaspora, and send home remittances to family members (often aged) who prefer to remain in Tonga. Tongans themselves often have to operate in two different contexts, which they often call \"anga fakatonga\", the traditional Tongan way, and \"anga fakapālangi\", the Western way. A culturally adept Tongan learns both sets of rules and when to switch between them.\n\nAny description of Tongan culture that limits itself to what Tongans see as \"anga fakatonga\" would give a seriously distorted view of what people actually do, in Tonga, or in diaspora, because accommodations are so often made to \"anga fakapālangi\". The following account tries to give both the idealized and the on-the-ground versions of \"Tongan culture\".\n\nTraditionally, fishing and farming have accounted for the livelihood of a majority of Tongans. The main food crops include Sweet Potatoes, Bananas, Yucca, Taro and giant Taro to name a few. Cash crops include squash and pumpkins, which have in recent years replaced bananas and copra as the largest agricultural exports. Vanilla is another important cash crop.\n\nMen and women hold unique roles in Tongan society. A man usually holds the power and is considered the head of his household. However, a man has an obligation to care for his sister and her children. So in Tongan families ones maternal uncle or Fa'etangata, is considered lower in ranking because of his obligation to take care of the needs of his sister and her children. Contrastly in Tongan families your paternal aunt is the highest-ranking member and is referred to as mehekitanga or Fahu. Men hold power and women hold rank. In ancient Tonga one would inherit titles, land and people from their mother, after Christianity this was changed to mainly inheriting from ones father. Until recently it was Tapu (taboo) for any male that has passed puberty to be in the same room with his sister or girl cousins alone. This was done under the notion of respect or faka'apa'apa. The recent introduction of western ideas and culture has slowly made this taboo vary widely amongst Tongan families. At one time it was inappropriate for a brother and sister to even watch television together if the characters were to kiss or even flirt on screen. That is mostly laxed in the modern age, but you still have families that will separate the boys and girls when watching TV or movies. The notion of faka'apa'apa is still strong but the meaning of it is slowly changing especially amongst the youth of the Tongan diaspora. Other key members of Tongan kinship are the 'Ulumotu'a or the oldest male in ones extended family on your father's side, they are usually called upon to be in charge of funerals and other family events. They do not out rank a Fahu but they have power to direct events. Also noteworthy is all of your maternal aunts are called your mothers, likewise you paternal uncles are your fathers. Your cousins on either side are called your brothers or sisters. Similarly if you are female and your sisters children are called your children also because you are a mother to them. Same applies if you are a male and your brothers children will refer to you as a father.\n\nIn post-contact Tonga, newly pubescent males were kamu (\"tefe\"), or circumcised by cutting one slit in the foreskin, on the underside of the penis. This is a Christian practice of biblical context. Afterwards, the family held a feast for the new \"man\". Circumcision is still practiced, but it is now done informally. Sometimes it is done at home, with relatives present. More commonly a boy, or a group of boys, go to the hospital, where the operation is done under sanitary conditions.\n\nIn pre-contact Tonga, a girl's first menstruation was celebrated by a feast. This practice continued up until the mid-20th century, at which point it fell out of favor.\n\nContemporary funerals are large, well-attended occasions, even for Tongans who are not wealthy. Relatives gather, often travelling long distances to do so. Large amounts of food are contributed, then distributed to the crowds during and after the funeral. Funeral practices are a mix of introduced Christian rites and customs (such as a wake and a Christian burial), and older indigenous customs that survive from pre-contact times. For instance, mourners wear black (a Western custom) but also wrap mats (ta'ovala) around their waist. The type and size of the mat proclaim the mourner's relationship to the deceased.\n\nTongan families do not necessarily compete to put on the largest, grandest funeral possible, but they do strive to show respect for the deceased by doing all that is customary. This can put great strain on the resources of the immediate family and even the extended family. Sometimes the funeral is called a \"fakamasiva\", an occasion that leads to poverty.\n\nIn pre-contact Tonga, female pre-marital chastity was the ideal, if not the norm.\n\nTheoretically, a girl received suitors at a \"faikava\", or kava-drinking gathering. She presided over the bowl, made the kava, and handed out the cups. The suitors sat in a circle around the bowl, chatting, bragging, arguing, and showing off for the demure young lady. All was done under the eye of the elders, thus protecting the maiden from any unseemly advances.\n\nIn actuality, young men and women who were attracted to each other would often meet privately, in the bush or on the beach. Sometimes the young women became pregnant as a result of these meetings. Marriage might or might not result. Even if it did not, paternity was generally announced (by the mother) and accepted (by the father). The child was usually welcomed by all relatives. The mother was not considered a \"fallen woman\" and could usually find a husband afterwards.\n\nThere was less tolerance of sexual mistakes on the part of high-born women, who were expected to \"demonstrate\" their virginity by bleeding heavily on their wedding night. The groom's aunts would display the stained barkcloth (or later, sheet), after bathing the bride to inspect her for cuts that might have been inflicted to draw blood. It is said that grooms might show their love and concern for non-bleeding brides by cutting themselves and smearing their own blood on the barkcloth or sheet.\n\nThe virginity of the bride was the guarantee for the paternity of a high-ranking child. Another way in which high-society marriages differed from those of commoners is that marriages with close kin were allowed, rather than forbidden. Rather than allow their bloodlines to be contaminated with the blood of commoners, the \"houeiki\" married among themselves.\n\nAfter marriage, informal divorce seems to have been common and easy. An unhappy wife had only to return to her brother, who was obligated to support her. Adultery was known, as it is in every human society, but was a perilous venture, especially if the cuckolded husband was a renowned warrior.\n\nIn common with many other Polynesian societies, Ancient Tonga also made room for the male transgender, fakafefine. These men wore female clothing, took on female roles, and had casual sexual liaisons with other men. There seems to have been no stigma attached to sex with a fakafefine.\n\nRelated, yet different was the notion of male beauty. When a boy at young age turned out to be very handsome, he would be barred from heavy work, instead he would be pampered, his skin rubbed with oils, his hair meticulously taken care of, and so on. The idea was that in this way he would grow up to such a beauty that he would be irresistible to chief's daughters. Then a child of high rank would be born into the family, elevating the status of all.\n\nAfter the arrival of the Europeans, a Christian marriage took place before the traditional rites, or was inserted between them. Fakafefine kept a low profile. Commoners adopted the ideal of pre-marital virginity and the display of bloody bedclothing. Divorce theoretically became formal, and difficult, though this may have only slightly discouraged informal separations and subsequent common-law unions.\n\nWith the waning of missionary influence, urban youngsters are now experimenting with dances and dating, the later Western imports. Fakafefine are now known as \"fakaleiti\" and are celebrated in the Miss Galaxy Pageant, which claims princess Lupepauu, granddaughter of the king as its patron.\n\nThere is said to be some prostitution in urban areas now, particularly areas with frequent Western visitors (Nukuʻalofa and Neiafu). Sex education is discouraged by the church; encouraged (with limited success) by the Ministry of Health. There are a few cases of AIDS in the kingdom, but Tonga's relative isolation has prevented the disease from becoming the scourge that it has been in other countries.\n\nAll Polynesian cultures are strongly stratified, ranging from somewhat symbolic to more actual power being held. Tongan culture is no exception, and despite almost two centuries of western influence, it is, together with Samoa, still the most stratified culture. In former times, the king (tui) with the royal family was on top. Below him were the high chiefs (houeiki), the estate holders and warlords, and below them the lower chiefs (fototehina), and the working chiefs (matāpule; in fact attendants to the chiefs to which they belonged, providing services to them, like fishing, tax collection, kavamixing, undertaking and protocol keeping). Below them were the ordinary people (tua), and below them, or maybe more or less on the same level, the slaves, prisoners of war (popula).\n\nIn the modern context, the king remains in this position and has the final executive power of government. The high chiefs are now limited to 33 titles and are called nobles (nopele), although some nobles carry more than one title. They are still estate holders, and as such have some influence, but they do not hold absolute power over the government (although many of them are high ranking civil servants). The lower chiefs have disappeared (and the word \"fototehina\", formerly signifying the lower chiefs, now means 'brothers'). The matāpule have also largely disappeared except those who keep the protocol and serve as official spokesmen for the king and nobles, as has the royal undertaker, Lauaki. Tax collection is a task for the central government only and no longer has any noble involvement. Slavery is abolished since the emancipation of 1875, and all other people are just the 'commoners'.\n\nThe worldly power described above can be called \"status\". A Tongan obtains his status from his father (or sometimes uncle, but always through the male line). He inherits his (noble or matāpule) title from his father. The crown prince will succeed his father. Land ownership is only inherited through the father.\n\nHowever, status as such does not place you in society; this is based on \"rank\". A Tongan obtains his rank from his mother, and that determines his place in the social order. Within the family, the rank of women is higher than that of men. Likewise, the elder sister of a king, if he has one, has a higher blood rank the king himself. This was known as the so-called Tamahā (holy child) in pre-European times.\n\nIn practice, high rank and high status always go together because no high ranking woman would ever marry a commoner, and no chief would ever marry a low ranking woman. In fact when prince Alaivahamamao eloped with the daughter of a low chiefess, Tuimala, he was stripped from his royal status and had to flee to Hawaii. Children from that marriage, grandchildren of the king, would have obtained no significant rank. Albeit later, after a divorce, Alai was reconciled with his father and married princess Alaileula from Samoa. He did not however become prince again and died in 2004 with only the noble title Māatu.\n\nRank and status are fixed from birth. There is no way in Tongan society to climb up in rank. A low-ranking chief will always remain the lesser of a high-ranking chief, even though his lands may be bigger and more profitable. He can try to marry a high ranking woman, for instance if she is interested in his rich lands, and so increase the rank of his children, however. Status on the other hand, although usually fixed too, can have some vertical movement. The second son of a noble, normally not in line for his father's title, may get it after all if his older brother dies prematurely. In addition to this, sometimes, but very rarely, the king may elevate some person to high status.\n\nEven more striking was the situation with Tāufaʻāhau, the later king George Tupou I. He was born in a chiefly family of lower rank, not belonging to the houʻeiki. As such he never could attend at the chiefly kava ceremonies as the equal of the high chiefs. By consequence he avoided them. Even after the Battle of Velata when he had defeated the Tuʻi Tonga and had become the most powerful man of the whole archipelago, he still remained a person of inferior rank. But then he had the power to take Lupepauʻu, who had been the wife of the Tuʻi Tonga and hence the highest ranking woman at that time as wife. Thus, paradoxically, his children were born into a higher 'status' than he had. Presently his descendants, the current royal family, are the highest ranking Tongans of all.\n\nTongans make use of different Tongan words and expressions when addressing, referring to, or speaking in the presence of persons of different social standing. It is a serious social mistake to use the wrong word in the wrong context. Hence, on many formal occasions, hereditary orators, the matāpule, speak on behalf of commoners who might not know the correct language. They also conduct ceremonies on behalf of the king and nobles.\n\nA few examples of such language follow. The monarch of Tonga does not have a \"nima\", which is the generic word for arm: he has a toʻokupu. This word is also used in translations of the Bible into Tongan: God has a toʻokupu. Commoners use the word ʻalu; nobles meʻa, and the king hāʻele. Some common words, such as \"afi\", fire, are considered too vulgar to pronounce in front of exalted personages, and is changed to the more genteel \"maama\", light, in those cases. A common Tongan greeting is \"Malo e lelei\", which might be translated as \"Congratulations on your well-being.\" When addressing the monarch, this is changed to \"Malo e lakoifie\".\n\nOnce a Tongan has obtained a hereditary title, be it noble or matāpule, he will be named with that title and no longer with his baptised name. Such titles are usually for life, but the holder can be stripped of it when convicted of a serious crime, and he will then return to his original name. Some titles are equal to the family name, others are not. For example, when somewhere in history they were given away to another family if the original holder died without sons. In former times a woman could hold such a title, but nowadays only men. To distinguish successive holders of the same title, it is permisseable to add the original name between parenthesis. For example: Fielakepa (Siosaia Aleamotuʻa). No further prefixes such as \"The, Mr.\" or \"Sir\" are needed in addressing, although in writing often \"Hon\" (Honourable) is used. Tongans are still overawed by those of higher rank.\n\nAfter the coronation of the king in 2008 it suddenly became the habit in Tonga to add 'lord' to the address, something that was absolutely not done before. Therefore, nowadays one would rather say for example: lord Tuʻivakanō (or even honourable lord Tuʻivakanō), (as meanwhile Fielakepa himself was promoted to baron).\nCultural changes are now leading to the females of the Tongan race to be the hierarchy of the family. With the new take over of the King women now can inherit the land in her family before the eldest son. This has now been signed by the King of Tonga and the support from nobles has made this happen.\n\nViolent crime is limited, but increasing, and public perception associates this with returns of ethnic Tongans who have been raised overseas. A few notable cases involve young men raised since infancy in the US, whose family neglected to obtain citizenship for them and who were deported on involvement with the American justice system. At this moment crime increases faster than the police force and are expected to remain a serious problem for the years to come. Increasing wealth has also increased the gap between the rich and the poor, leading to more and more burglaries.\n\nAt this moment most prisons in Tonga still abide with the old laissez-faire attitude. Usually having no fences, no iron bars and so forth, that makes it very easy for the inmates to escape. This system may be required to change, adapting for the influx of foreign born/raised criminals who may treat such a system with contempt, alternatively a minimum/maximum security prison system may need to be developed placing escapists or repeat offenders into closed prisons, but for the moment the jailors can trust on the goodwill of the inmates. Some are glad to be in prison, not to be bothered by demanding family members. There is no social stigma on being in prison (although that may change now too), but then of course it also does not serve as a deterrent against crimes.\n\nMore troublesome are the youth offenders \"schoolboys who want to have money to show off\" and are apprehended in burglaries. As there are no juvenile prisons, they are to be locked up in the main prisons together with hardened criminals. For a while it was tried to confine them on Tau, a small island offshore Tongatapu but that was not ideal either.\n\nIn the 1990s Chinese immigration caused resentment among the native Tongan population (especially those from Hong Kong, who bought a Tongan passport to get away before the Beijing takeover). Much violent crime nowadays is directed against these Chinese.\n\nThere is however a rise in violence among Tongans that have left Tonga. On March 7, 1987, a 15-year-old was fatally shot in the Disneyland parking lot. The incident began as an early morning confrontation between rival Samoan and Tongan gang members before escalating into a brawl. Another participant was convicted of second-degree murder, but the conviction was subsequently overturned by a state appellate court.\n\nThe genre of short stories in Tonga is most associated with 'Epeli Hau'ofa, whose most popular collection of stories, \"Tales of the Tikong\", was published in 1973. Konai Helu Thaman was one of the country's earliest published poets.\n\nIn pre-contact Tonga, women did not do the cooking (cooking in an earth oven was hard, hot work, the province of men) or work in the fields. They raised children, gathered shellfish on the reef, and made \"koloa\", barkcloth and mats, which were a traditional form of wealth exchanged at marriages and other ceremonial occasions. An industrious woman thus raised the social status of her household. Her family also slept soundly, on the piles of mats and barkcloth that were the traditional bedding. On sunny days, these were spread on the grass to air, which prolonged their life.\n\nAmong the typical \"koloa\" are:\n\nWoven mats serve a variety of purposes, from the ordinary to the ceremonial. Many woven mats are passed down from generation to generation, acquiring greater status with the passage of time. It is in fact a collection of these mats in the palace that forms the true crown jewels of Tonga. These royal mats are displayed only on high state occasions such as the death of a member of the royal family or the coronation of a monarch.\n\nBefore Western contact, many objects of daily use were made of carved wood: food bowls, head rests (\"kali\"), war clubs and spears, and cult images. Tongan craftsmen were skilled at inlaying pearl-shell and ivory in wood, and Tongan war clubs were treasured items in the neighboring archipelago of Fiji.\n\nTongan craftsman were also adept at building canoes. Many canoes for daily use were simple \"pōpaos\", dug-out canoes, shaped from a single log with fire and adze and outfitted with a single outrigger. Due to a dearth of large trees suitable for building large war canoes, these canoes were often imported from Fiji.\n\nThe tradition Tongan \"fale\" consisted of a curved roof (branches lashed with sennit rope, or \"kafa\", thatched with woven palm leaves) resting on pillars made of tree trunks. Woven screens filled in the area between the ground and the edge of the roof. The traditional design was extremely well adapted to surviving hurricanes. If the winds threatened to shred the walls and overturn the roof, the inhabitants could chop down the pillars, so that the roof fell directly onto the ground. Because the roof was curved, like a limpet shell, the wind tended to flow over it smoothly. The inhabitants could ride out the storm in relative safety.\n\nThere are many surviving examples of Tongan stone architecture, notably the Haamonga a Maui and mound tombs (langi) near Lapaha, Tongatapu. And so several on other islands. Archaeologists have dated them hundreds to a thousand years old.\n\nTongan males were often heavily tattooed. In Captain Cook's time only the Tui Tonga (king) was not: because he was too high ranked for anybody to touch him. Later it became the habit that a young Tui Tonga went to Samoa to be tattooed there.\n\nThe practice of Tātatau disappeared under heavy missionary disapproval, but was never completely suppressed. It is still very common for men (less so, but still some for women), to be decorated with some small tattoos. Nevertheless, tattoos shows one's strength. Tattoos also tell a story.\n\nTonga has evolved its own version of Western-style clothing, consisting of a long tupenu, or sarong, for women, and a short tupenu for men. Women cover the tupenu with a \"kofu\", or Western-style dress; men top the tupenu either with a T-shirt, a Western casual shirt, or on formal occasions, a dress shirt and a suit coat. Preachers in some Methodist sects still wear long frock coats, a style that has not been current in the West for more than a hundred years. These coats must be tailored locally.\n\nTongan outfits are often assembled from used Western clothing (for the top) mixed with a length of cloth purchased locally for the tupenu. Used clothing can be found for sale at local markets, or can be purchased overseas and mailed home by relatives.\n\nSome women have learned to sew and own sewing machines (often antique treadle machines). They do simple home-sewing of shirts, kofu, and school uniforms.\n\nNukualofa, the capital, supports several tailoring shops. They tailor tupenu and suitcoats for Tongan men, and matching tupenu and kofu for Tongan women. The women's outfits may be decorated with simple blockprint patterns on the hems.\n\nThere is also some local production of knit jerseys by Tongans operating imported sergers. They produce on speculation and sell at the Nukualofa market.\n\nWomen who attend the Wesleyan Methodist girls' school, Queen Sālote College, are taught several Western handicrafts, such as embroidery and crochet. They learn to make embroidered pillowcases and bed coverings or crocheted lace tablecloths, bedcovers, and lace trim. However, Western-style handicrafts such as these have not become widely popular outside the school setting. They require expensive imported materials that can only be purchased in major towns. Village women are much more likely to turn their efforts to weaving mats or beating barkcloth, which can be done with free local material.\n\nA few Tongan village churches are decorated with freehand murals or decorations done in house paint, which may mix crosses, flowers, and traditional barkcloth motifs. The practice is uncommon and the execution is always crude.\n\nIn the 1970s there was a small factory near Nukualofa that made simple jewelry from coral and tortoise-shell for sale to Western tourists. It is not clear if this factory is still operating. The government may have protected sea-turtles and corals (as has been done in most other countries) and ended this line of manufacture.\n\nScholars know relatively little about the music of Tonga as it existed before Tonga was encountered by European explorers. Early visitors, such as Captain Cook and the invaluable William Mariner, note only the singing and drumming during traditional dance performances. Scholars can assume the existence of the lali or slit-gong, and the nose flute, as these survived to later times. Traditional songs, passed down over the generations, are still sung at chiefly ceremonies. Some ancient dances are still performed, such as ula, otuhaka and meetuupaki.\n\nMethodists were known for their extensive use of hymns in their emotional services. True to their tradition, the early missionaries introduced hymn-singing to their congregations. These early hymns—still sung today in some of the Methodist sects, such as the Free Church of Tonga and the Church of Tonga - have Tongan tunes and simple, short Tongan lyrics. There is a special Tongan music notation for these, and other, musics.\n\nTraditional music is preserved in the set pieces performed at royal and noble weddings and funerals, and in the song sung during the traditional ceremony of apology, the lou-ifi. Radio Tonga begins each day's broadcast with a recording from Honourable Veehala, a nobleman and celebrated virtuoso of the nose flute. This music is not popular music; it is a cherished heirloom, preserved by specialists and taught as needed for special occasions.\n\nIn former times, there was only one main meal, a midday meal cooked in an earth oven. Villagers would rise, eat some leftover food from the previous day's meal, and set out to work in the fields, fishing, gathering shellfish, etc. The results of the morning's work would be cooked by the men, and served to the assembled household. The remnants would be placed in a basket suspended from a tree. This food is served as an end-of-the-day snack as well as the next day's breakfast. Food past its prime was given to the pigs.\n\nThe diet consisted mainly of taro, yams, bananas, coconuts, and fish baked in leaves; shellfish were usually served raw, as a relish. The liquid from the center of coconuts was commonly drunk, and the soft \"spoon meat\" of young coconuts much relished. Baked breadfruit was eaten in season. Pigs were killed and cooked only on special occasions, such as weddings, funerals, feasts honoring a visiting chief, and the like. Tongans also ate chickens.\n\nFood could be stored by feeding it to pigs. Pre-contact Tongans also built elevated storehouses for yams. Yams would keep only a few months. Hence a household's main security was generous distribution of food to relatives and neighbors, who were thus put under an obligation to share in their turn.\n\nMany new foods were introduced in the 19th and early 20th centuries, following Western contacts and settlements. The cassava plant was one such introduction; it is called \"manioke\" in Tongan. While it lacks the prestige of the yam, it is an easy plant to grow and a common crop. Introduced watermelons became popular. They were eaten either by themselves, or pulped and mixed with coconut milk, forming a popular drink called \"'otai\". Other fruits, such as oranges, lemons, and limes, became popular. Tongans also adopted onions, green onions, cabbage, carrots, tomatoes, and other common vegetables. In the last few decades, Tongan farmers with access to large tracts of land have engaged in commercial farming of pumpkins and other easily shipped vegetables as cash crops.\n\nTongans now consume large quantities of imported flour and sugar. One dish that uses both is \"topai\" (doughboys), flour and water worked into a paste and dropped into a kettle of boiling water, then served with a syrup of sugar and coconut milk. Topai are a common funeral food, being easily prepared for hundreds of mourners.\n\nThere are now bakeries in the larger cities. The most popular loaves are soft, white, and bland. There are also local soft drink bottlers, who make various local varieties of soda. A Tongan who might once have breakfasted on bits of cooked pork and yam from a hanging basket may now have white bread and soda for breakfast.\n\nPurchased prepared foods have also made great headway, even in remote villages. Canned cornbeef is a great favorite. It is eaten straight from the can, or mixed with coconut milk and onions, wrapped in leaves, and baked in the earth oven. Tongans also eat canned fish, such as tuna. In villages or towns with refrigeration, cheap frozen \"mutton flaps\" imported from New Zealand are popular. Tongans also eat the common South Pacific \"ship's biscuit\", hard plain crackers once a shipboard staple. These crackers are called \"mā pakupaku\".\n\nTongans no longer make an earth oven every day. Most daily cooking is done by women, who cook in battered pots over open fires in the village, in wood-burning stoves in some households, and on gas or electric ranges in some of the larger towns. The meal schedule has also changed, to more Westernized breakfast, light lunch, and heavy dinner. Tongans say that the old schedule is unworkable when household members have Western-style jobs, or attend schools at some distance from home; such family members cannot come home to eat, then have a doze after a heavy mid-day meal.\n\nAs well as drinking soda, Tongans now drink tea and coffee. Usually this is of the cheapest variety, and served with tinned condensed milk.\n\nSome men drink alcohol. Sometimes this is imported Australian or New Zealand beer; more often it is home-brew, \"hopi\", made with water, sugar or mashed fruit, and yeast. Imported drinks are sold only to Tongans who have liquor permits, which require a visit to a government office, and limit the amount of alcohol which can be purchased. There are no such formalities with \"hopi\". Drinking is usually done secretively; a group of men gather and drink until they are drunk. Such gatherings sometimes result in drunken quarrels and assaults.\n\n\nThe drinking of kava by men at kava clubs is somewhat equal to drinking beers in the bar in western cultures. However formal kava drinking is an important and intrinsic part of Tonga culture.\n\nTonga is notable for its high obesity rates with over 90% of the population being overweight. Consequently, many Tongan islanders have an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes and other obesity related diseases which place the nation's health service under considerable strain. Much of this is related to the nation's cultural love of food and eating as well as the modern influx of cheap and high-fat content meat, with corned beef and lamb belly remaining firm favourites in Tongan cuisine. Despite being a highly obese population, there is little stigma attached to being overweight as one might find in many Western civilizations. Like a great number of South Pacific cultures, large bodies are often revered, though there is growing acknowledgment of the health risks involved.\n\nTongan men wear a tupenu, a cloth that is similar to a sarong, which is wrapped around the waist. It should be long enough to cover the knees or the shins of the legs. In daily life, any shirt (T-shirt, jersey, woven shirt) will do to top the tupenu. Usually shirts are used clothing imported from overseas. Some men will go shirtless working on their plantations, but by law they are not allowed to go shirtless in public.\n\nOn formal occasions a taovala, a woven mat, is worn over the tupenu. It is wrapped around the waist and secured with a kafa rope. The tupenu may be smartly tailored and have a matching suit jacket. If a man cannot afford to have a suit tailored to fit him, he will buy a used Western jacket, or wear a threadbare jacket inherited from an older relative.\n\nWomen too wear a tupenu, but a long one which should reach to the ankles. They sometimes wear a shorter tupenu for working in the house or picking shellfish on the reef. The tupenu is usually topped with a \"kofu\", or dress. This may be sewn to order, or it may be an imported used dress. Sometimes women wear blouses or jerseys.\n\nOn formal occasions women too wear a taovala, or more often a kiekie, a string skirt attached to a waistband. It is lighter and cooler than a mat. Kiekie are made from many different materials, from the traditional (pandanus leaves, as used in mats) to the innovative (unspooled magnetic tape from tape cassettes).\n\nHuge taovala are worn at funerals.\n\nThe largest Methodist church holds a yearly celebration for the women of the congregation. Churches hold special church services to which women wear white clothing. All the Methodist churches have adopted the Western custom of women wearing hats to church. Only women who have been admitted to the congregation can wear hats; those denied admittance (because they are still young, or because they are considered to be living immoral lives) are only \"inquirers\" and go hatless.\n\nMore and more Tongan men are abandoning the traditional tupenu for trousers, at least when it comes to working in the fields. Women can be innovative in terms of color and cut within the context of the traditional kofu/tupenu combination.\n\nRugby union is the national sport in Tonga. The nation has a national rugby union team, which played in the 1987, 1995, 1999, 2003, 2007 Rugby World Cup and the 2015 competitions. Though Tongans are passionate rugby followers, the small population base means that internationally, Tongan rugby continually struggles. Often, young talent emigrate to countries which offer greater prospects of individual success such as New Zealand and Australia. Some notable rugby union players of Tongan descent include Jonah Lomu (played for the All Blacks) and Toutai Kefu (plays for Australian Wallaby).\n\nRugby league is a popular sport enjoyed by Tongans. Football has a following, while judo, surfing, volleyball, and cricket have gained popularity in recent years.\n\nThe king and the majority of the royal family are members of the Free Wesleyan Church (Methodist) which claims some 40,000 adherents in the country. There are four other Methodist denominations in the country, as well as a number of (much smaller) Pentecostal and Evangelicalist congregations. Roman Catholic Church and each have a strong presence in the country as well. There is a small Seventh-day Adventist Church group, an Anglican church, and a few adherents of the Bahá'í Faith in Tonga. There are even some Tongan Muslims.\n\nTongans are ardent churchgoers. Methodist services usually follow a call and response structure. Singing in the church is often done a cappella. Although church attends primarily to the spiritual needs of the population, it also functions as the primary social hub. As consequence people who go to a church of another denomination are absolutely not shunned.\n\nSunday in Tonga is celebrated as a day for rest and worship; strict Sabbatarianism is enshrined in the constitution. No trade is allowed on Sunday, except essential services, after special approval by the minister of police. Lawbreakers risk a fine or imprisonment.\n\nSome Tongan holidays are based upon the Christian faith, which include Easter with its preceding Friday and following Monday and both Christmas days (but not Pentecost, Ascuncion, etc.). Tonga also celebrates New Year's Day on January 1 and Anzac Day on April 25. Tonga's unique holidays are: Emancipation day on June 4, Crownprince's birthday on July 12, the King's official birth- and coronation day on August (which is celebrated with the consumption of African cuisine), National Tonga day on November 4 (formerly known as Constitution day) and King George Tupou I's installation as Tui Kanokupolu on December 4, often misnamed as his birthday. Since the promulgation of new holidays on December 6, 2006, May 4 and July 4 are no longer public holidays.\n\nPopular Tongan festivals included (new scheme still to be established since the change of public holidays):\n\n\n\n"}
