{"id": "2033102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033102", "title": "Lions (album)", "text": "Lions (album)\n\nLions is the sixth studio album by American rock band The Black Crowes. It was released in 2001 as their first album on V2 Records following their departure from Columbia, and is their only studio album to feature guitarist Audley Freed. \"Lions\" was recorded in New York City in January and February of that year, and was produced by Don Was. Bass guitar duties were shared by Rich Robinson and Was, as Greg Rzab had left the band and was not replaced until the tour that followed the release of the album.\n\nThe album debuted on the \"Billboard\" 200 at its peak position of 20, selling more than 53,000 copies in its first week. \"Lions\" received mixed reviews; although the overall sound of the album generally garnered praise, a frequent complaint was the lack of \"memorable\" songs. The critics who rated \"Lions\" lowest considered it a poor imitation of the band's influences, such as Led Zeppelin.\n\nThe band supported \"Lions\" with two North American tours (one with Oasis co-headlining), and a short tour of Europe and Japan in between. Soundboard recordings of several concerts were available for download to those who owned the album. Following the tour, the band went on hiatus until 2005.\n\nThe Black Crowes began writing songs for the follow-up to their 1999 album \"By Your Side\" as free agents, having left Columbia Records through a loophole in their contract. The decision to leave was driven by Columbia's promotion of \"By Your Side\". According to band member Rich Robinson, \"That record was destined to fail because ... [Columbia executives] just said, 'It's not going to do well ... It's no use wasting time or money.' \" The band also was frustrated by the label's request for albums sounding similar to their first, 1990's \"Shake Your Money Maker\".\n\nIn late 1999, lead vocalist Chris Robinson began a relationship with Kate Hudson, which would influence subtly the lyrics on \"Lions\". The pair met at a Friday night party in Manhattan, which led to a Saturday stroll through Central Park and a Sunday move-in. Their wedding at the Aspen, Colorado, ranch of Kurt Russell and Kate's mother, Goldie Hawn, followed on , 2000.\n\nBefore the 2000 tour with Jimmy Page, bassist Sven Pipien was fired after arriving late for a performance and missing the return flight. Rich said it was not enough to warrant termination, but Pipien's defensiveness when confronted about the incident was too much to handle. Greg Rzab and Andy Hess were considered as replacements; the band chose Rzab because he had more touring experience than Hess. Rzab, however, departed before the recording of \"Lions\".\n\nIn mid-2000, the band signed with Richard Branson's V2 Records. Rich explained, \"The cool thing about V2, the reason that we chose them, is that they told us, 'You guys go make the record you want to make. Then give it to us and we'll sell it.' That's what we needed to hear.\" The freedom V2 afforded through its hands-off approach influenced not only the music, but the album title as well. According to Chris, \"\"Lions\" is a symbol that stands for the fierce feeling and freedom that music allows you.\"\n\nChris Robinson granted that the experience of playing Led Zeppelin songs with Jimmy Page influenced \"Lions\", but not on a song-by-song basis. \"Led Zeppelin's music is very dramatic and very dynamic. That's something we've attempted to do with our style also. I think it definitely affected how we make our music.\" Funk and R&B were bigger influences than on past albums, and \"Miracle to Me\" was influenced by Nick Drake.\n\nChris claimed Kate Hudson's influence on his lyrics was subtle: \"More so than a literal reference to her, it's the vantage point from where I'm writing. It's the reasons that I'm singing and it's the feeling. That is an influence far greater than the literal influence.\" He did grant, however, that \"Soul Singing\" and \"Miracle to Me\" were written with Hudson in mind, and explained that the album's track order roughly follows a path from confusion to clarity that mirrored his own. Producer Don Was said of Chris, \"I realized he was taking on something that was significant. He was writing about becoming a man ... There's a lot of old man/young man symbolism that's a self-conversation ... I don't know that anyone has actually chronicled being 33 [years old] as well as this album.\"\n\nHeated discussions during the writing of \"Lions\" were rare, owing to the Robinson brothers' usual method in which Rich writes the music and Chris writes the lyrics. \"Soul Singing\" was the only song to cause disagreement; \"I'd written this part where although the vocals changed the music stayed the same throughout. I thought we should add something or just not finish it, but Chris thought it was already a song, and a good one. So we talked about that one for a while\", Rich recalled.\n\nThe Black Crowes had previously sent Was demos to interest him in producing \"By Your Side\", but Was believed the demos were good enough to be the album. Columbia Records disagreed with Was' assessment, however, leading to Kevin Shirley's hiring. With complete artistic control under V2 Records, the band was free to hire Was for \"Lions\". Recording took place in January and at Montana Rehearsal Studios and Theater 99 Recording in New York City. The recording sessions progressed as smoothly as the writing; only \"Come On\" caused conflict between the band and Was. Rich acknowledged, \"We must have recorded 'Come On' about five times in different ways ... Then [Was] just took it away with him and came back with this different mix\", which impressed the band, leading to its inclusion on the album. The band ultimately was satisfied by the recording experience, finding that Was was devoted to helping realize their vision for the album rather than imposing his own.\n\nThe sessions were recorded on tape and Pro-Tools simultaneously; the band ultimately chose to use the tape version, as they preferred its sound quality. Most songs were recorded live with the band members playing together in one room, and microphones set up to capture the overall sound rather than that of individual instruments. Was felt this approach best approximated the feel of a Black Crowes concert, later noting that the \"Lions\" songs debuted at a private show in \"sounded exactly like the record.\" Most of the recordings that comprise the album were recorded during preproduction, the purpose of which was to test arrangements. \"[W]e didn't think we were recording the record. And it turned out to be great\" said Rich. Audley Freed played guitar on only three tracks because Rich did not want \"the meat of the song, which is the riff\", to get lost in a \"wall of sound\". Though Rich brought his entire collection of guitars and a number of amplifiers, he mostly recorded with a 1954 Fender Esquire through a Harry Joyce amp. To achieve a resonator-like tone on \"Soul Singing\", he used a James Trussart metal-bodied electric. Since Andy Hess did not join The Black Crowes until the above private show, the band did not have a bassist during the recording sessions; Rich thus played bass on most tracks. On \"Lay It All on Me\", however, Rich played piano, leaving the bass guitar duties to Don Was.\n\nA total of twenty songs were recorded during the \"Lions\" sessions. Of the seven cut from the album, four were mixed and mastered for potential release; three (\"Last Time Again\", \"Love Is Now\" and \"Sleepyheads\") appeared as B-sides, and the other (\"The Pretty Gurl Song\") circulates on a bootleg recording.\n\nSoon after the \"Lions\" sessions, V2 Records threw a \"completion party\" at The Bank in New York City, at which The Black Crowes performed four songs from the new album, five songs from their catalog and a cover of Fleetwood Mac's \"Oh Well\". The band then played scattered dates in the U.S. and UK, including an appearance on \"Later... with Jools Holland\", ahead of \"Lions\"' release. During this sequence of concerts, every song from the album was performed except \"Losing My Mind\" and \"Ozone Mama\"; the remaining two would be played on the album-supporting tour.\n\n\"Lions\" was released on , 2001, in the UK and a day later in the U.S.; it subsequently debuted at its peak position of number 20 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, and sold over 53,000 copies in its first week. As of , the album had sold 192,000 copies in the U.S.\n\nAround the album's release, band members made numerous promotional appearances. Chris Robinson guested on \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\" the day before the album was released in the U.S., and Chris and Steve Gorman appeared on \"The Howard Stern Show\" the following day. The band performed \"Soul Singing\" on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" on , and was inducted into Hollywood's RockWalk four days later. A second late night television performance of \"Soul Singing\" took place on , this time on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\".\n\n\"Lickin'\" was the first single from the album; it peaked at number 9 on \"Billboard\"'s Mainstream Rock Tracks on . The song's promotional video was a compilation of various takes of a static, low-angle shot of the band performing the song on a tiny stage. Second single \"Soul Singing\" peaked at number 12 on the same chart on ; its promotional video featured the band playing in a grassy field as the sun rises in the sky. A third single, \"Miracle to Me\", was canceled, but not before a promotional video was shot of the band ostensibly recording the song in a studio. Videos also were filmed for \"Come On\", \"Greasy Grass River\" and \"Cypress Tree\". Despite not playing on the album, Andy Hess appears in some of these videos, all of which are available as streaming media on the band's official website.\n\nMedia reviews of \"Lions\" were mixed. Numerous writers detected a Led Zeppelin influence (which was praised by some, but panned by others) and attributed it to The Black Crowes' recent tour with Jimmy Page. Dave McKenna, writing for \"The Washington Post\", compared Steve Gorman's drumming to that of John Bonham and found analogs to specific guitar and keyboard tones in Led Zeppelin albums. Nigel Williamson of \"The Times\" found similarities in Chris Robinson's voice on \"Come On\" to that of Robert Plant, and wrote that the song \"could almost be a \"Led Zeppelin II\" cast off.\" Other reviewers noted similarities to Aerosmith; Howard Cohen of \"The Miami Herald\" called \"Lickin'\" \"the best Aerosmith single that band hasn't recorded in years.\" The perceived lack of originality, though, turned off some critics. The \"Herald Sun\"'s Andrew McUtchen inferred \"The Black Crowes are unaware it's no longer the '70s and after one listen to \"Lions\" ... it's clear someone should tell them.\" Everett True of Playlouder concurred, writing \"It's blindingly obvious the Crowes are imitators, and always will be\", though Elysa Gardner, writing for \"USA Today\", recognized the band \"exhibit an energy and dexterity that compensate—at least somewhat—for their lack of invention.\"\n\nMany reviewers praised the sound of \"Lions\" but felt the songs were weak. Writing for dotmusic, John Mulvey highlighted the \"gutsy, no-messing sound\", but appreciated \"Cosmic Friend\" for being \"as impressively mad as you'd hope, too, beginning like Beatles psychedelia, taking in massive Brazilian drumming and a touch of pedal steel, before coalescing into furious heavy rock.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic described \"Lions\" as a \"powerful, textured hard rock record that covers a lot of ground, surging from powerful riffs to gospel choruses and funkier-than-expected riffs\", though he also complained that \"the songs can seem incomplete.\" Critics disagreed on which songs were lacking, though. \"Losing My Mind\" and \"Young Man, Old Man\" were called \"highlights\" by Jane Stevenson of the \"Toronto Sun\", though elsewhere the former was called \"woeful\" and the latter a \"'Freddie's Dead' vamp\" that should have been skipped.\n\nThe lyrics of \"Lions\" were another target for the critics. Mark Beaumont of \"NME\" stated that the eloquence ends at the \"Come awn come awn!/Everyone!\" chorus of \"Come On\", and Stephen Thompson of \"The A.V. Club\" bemoaned that \"hoary tropes abound\". \n\nShortly after the release of \"Lions\", The Black Crowes and Oasis, with opening band Spacehog, embarked on a co-headlining tour of North American theaters and amphitheaters. The Black Crowes had previously met Liam and Noel Gallagher and hit it off; \"... so we called them and asked them if they were interested [in touring together]. And so they were like, 'Yeah, we'd love to!'\" said Rich. The Black Crowes performed last each night, and their seventy-five-minute set always included numerous songs from \"Lions\". Members of Oasis typically would join them for an encore cover such as \"Lucifer Sam\", \"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\" or \"Road Runner\".\n\nThe Black Crowes followed the tour with one-off dates and festivals across Europe and Japan, including shows opening for Neil Young. Most of these shows, as well as most of the dates with Oasis, were made available by V2 Records as soundboard recordings. With \"Lions\" loaded in a CD-ROM drive, one could stream each show, as well as download one live track per week and one show in its entirety.\n\nFollowing a month-long break, the group returned to the road in late August for their Listen Massive Tour, with Beachwood Sparks as the opening band. The tour was billed as a return to two-hour shows featuring a rotating set list. The show at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles was canceled, but the band performed the next evening in Tucson, Arizona, as scheduled. All profits and merchandise sales from the following week's three shows at the Beacon Theatre in New York City were donated to the New York State World Trade Center Relief Fund and the New York City Public/Private Initiative. While in New York City, Chris and Rich performed \"By Your Side\" on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\". The Listen Massive Tour concluded with a 140-minute show at the Orpheum Theatre in Boston, Massachusetts, on . This would be Andy Hess and Audley Freed's last show as band members, as The Black Crowes went on hiatus shortly thereafter.\n\nAll songs written by Rich and Chris Robinson.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the quintessential honky-tonk steel sound — tuneful, aggressive, full of attitude.” Lloyd also credits Helms' sound as a major influence in shifting the sound of country music away from the hillbilly string-band sound popular in the 1930s and toward the more modern electric style that became prominent in the 1940s.\n\nHelms played a double-neck 1948 Gibson Console Grande steel guitar, which lacked the foot pedals found on a more modern pedal steel guitar, which did not come into prominence in country music until after Hank Williams' death in 1953. He tuned the outside neck to A C# E G# B C# E G# (low to high), which he called E6, and the inside neck to F# A B D# F# A C# E, which he called B13. Almost all of Don's classic leads were done on the E6 neck. He used the B13 neck for fills.\n\nAfter Williams' death, Helms went on to play on many classic country hits, including Patsy Cline's \"Walkin' After Midnight,\" Stonewall Jackson's \"Waterloo,\" the Louvin Brothers' \"Cash on the Barrelhead,\" Lefty Frizzell's \"Long Black Veil\" and Loretta Lynn's \"Blue Kentucky Girl.\"\n\nDonald Hugh Helms was born in New Brockton, Alabama, performed with many country music artists throughout the years including playing steel guitar on Lefty Frizzell's recording of \"Long Black Veil\". In the late 1950s Don played on several early Johnny Cash recordings on Columbia Records, \"The Fabulous Johnny Cash\", \"Now, There Was a Song!\" and \"Hymns by Johnny Cash\". During the mid-1960s Helms played in the Wilburn Brothers backup band, The Nashville Tennesseans. He later played behind Hank Williams' daughter Jett Williams.\n\nHelms also played for Hank Williams Jr. and wrote \"The Ballad of Hank Williams\" which he performed with Hank Jr. on \"The Pressure Is On\" LP released in 1981. In the song, Don jokingly refers to being fired by both Hank Sr. and Hank Jr. He also performed with Jett Williams, Hank Sr.'s daughter.\n\nHis last four known sessions were (in order) with Mark David and The Nightly Lights on November 15, 2007, Joey Allcorn's album \"All Alone Again\" in early 2008 followed by sessions with Teresa Street and then what is believed to be his final ever session with Vince Gill recording unfinished Hank Williams Sr. tracks.\n\nHelms died on August 11, 2008 in Nashville, Tennessee from complications of heart surgery and diabetes.\n\n"}

{"id": "2033116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033116", "title": "Fair Game (Scientology)", "text": "Fair Game (Scientology)\n\nThe term Fair Game is used to describe policies and practices carried out by the Church of Scientology towards people and groups it perceives as its enemies. Founder of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard, established the policy in the 1950s, in response to criticism both from within and outside his organization. Individuals or groups who are \"Fair Game\" are judged to be a threat to the Church and, according to the policy, can be punished and harassed using any and all means possible. In 1968, Hubbard officially canceled use of the term \"Fair Game\" because of negative public relations it caused, although the Church's aggressive response to criticism continued.\n\nApplying the principles of Fair Game, Hubbard and his followers targeted many individuals as well as government officials and agencies, including a program of covert and illegal infiltration of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other United States government agencies during the 1970s. They also conducted private investigations, character assassination and legal action against the Church's critics in the media. The policy remains in effect and has been defended by the Church of Scientology as a core religious practice.\n\nStarting in the 1980s, for their major branch in Los Angeles, California, the Scientology organization largely switched from using church members in harassment campaigns to hiring private investigators, including former and current Los Angeles police officers. The reason seemed to be that this gave the church a layer of protection in case embarrassing tactics were used and made public.\n\nScientology's founder, L. Ron Hubbard, said all opposition came from what he called \"Suppressive Persons\" (SPs)— which scientologists claim are \"anti-social people who want to destroy anything that benefits humanity.\" In written policies dating from the mid-1950s, Hubbard told his followers to take a hard line against perceived opponents. In 1955 he wrote, \"The purpose of the suit is to harass and discourage rather than to win. The law can be used easily to harass, and enough harassment on somebody who is simply on the thin edge anyway, well knowing that he is not authorized, will generally be sufficient to cause his professional decease. If possible, of course, ruin him utterly\".\n\nIn his confidential \"Manual of Justice\" of 1959, Hubbard wrote \"People attack Scientology. I never forget it, always even the score.\" He advocated using private investigators to investigate critics, who had turned out to be \"members of the Communist Party or criminals, usually both. The smell of police or private detectives caused them to fly, to close down, to confess. Hire them and damn the cost when you need to.\" He said that in dealing with opponents, his followers should \"always find or manufacture enough threat against them to cause them to sue for peace. Don't ever defend. Always attack.\" He urged the use of \"black propaganda\" to \"destroy reputation or public belief in persons, companies or nations.\"\n\nThe Church has retained an aggressive policy towards those it perceives as its enemies, and argued as late as 1985 that retributive action against \"enemies of Scientology\" should be considered a Constitutionally-protected \"core practice\" of Scientology.\n\nIn 1965, Hubbard formulated the \"Fair Game Law\", which states how to deal with people who interfere with Scientology's activities. These suppressive persons could be considered \"fair game\" for retaliation:\n\nBy FAIR GAME is meant, may not be further protected by the codes and disciplines or the rights of a Scientologist. In other words, a person who attacked the Church would not be protected by the Church or granted the rights of Scientologists in good standing.\n\nIn December of that year, Hubbard reissued the policy with additional clarifications to define the scope of Fair Game. He made it clear that the policy applied to non-Scientologists as well, declaring:\nThe homes, property, places and abodes of persons who have been active in attempting to: suppress Scientology or Scientologists are all beyond any protection of Scientology Ethics, unless absolved by later Ethics or an amnesty ... [T]his Policy Letter extends to suppressive non-Scientology wives and husbands and parents, or other family members or hostile groups or even close friends.\nIn his \"Introduction to Scientology Ethics\", published in 1968, Hubbard wrote that no Scientologist could be punished \"for any action taken against a Suppressive Person or Group during the period that person or group is 'fair game'.\" \n\nHe made it clear elsewhere in his writings that the policy would be applied to external organizations, including governments, that interfered with Scientology's activities. He told Scientologists:\nIf the Internal Revenue Service (in refusing the FCDC [\"Founding Church of Scientology, Washington DC\"] non-profit status) continues to act up or if the FDA does sue we can of course Comm Ev [\"Committee of Evidence\"] them and if found guilty, label and publish them as a Suppressive Group and fair game ... [N]one is fair game until he or she declares against us.\nIn a 1967 policy titled \"Penalties for Lower Conditions\", Hubbard wrote that opponents who are \"fair game\" may be \"deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed.\"\n\nIn a policy letter dated July 21, 1968, Hubbard explicitly cancelled these penalties. The new list of \"Penalties for Lower Conditions\" now said that someone in a condition of \"Enemy\" \"(m)ay be restrained or imprisoned. May not be protected by any rules or laws of the group he sought to injure. [...] May not be trained or processed or admitted to any [Scientology organisation].\" The same list says that in a condition of \"Treason\", a person, \"May not be protected by the rights and fair practices he sought to destroy for others. May be retrained or debarred. [...] Not covered by amnesties.\" Another policy letter from October that year announces:\n\"The practice of declaring people FAIR GAME will cease. FAIR GAME may not appear on any Ethics Order. It causes bad public relations. This [policy letter] does not cancel any policy on the treatment or handling of an SP.\"The church has maintained that the Fair Game policy was rescinded in 1968, because people had misinterpreted it. Spokesmen said that Hubbard's intended meaning was merely that former members could not appeal to Scientology's legal system for support or protection against anyone who might try to trick, sue or destroy them. Sociologist Roy Wallis commented that this interpretation seemed to be \"contradicted by the words on the page, and by actions taken against those regarded as enemies of the movement.\"\n\nThe Church continued to pursue an aggressive response to external critics, especially the U.S. Government. The doctrine of \"Fair Game\" was a central element of the Guardian's Office's operational policies. The original 1965 \"Fair Game Law\" is listed as a reference for GO staff in its confidential \"Intelligence Course\", which was later entered into evidence in a U.S. federal court case in 1979. During the case, Church lawyers admitted that \"Fair Game\" had been practiced long after its supposed cancellation in 1968.\n\nHubbard said in a 1976 affidavit that he had never intended to authorize harassment:\n\nThere was never any attempt or intent on my part by the writing of these policies (or any others for that fact), to authorise illegal or harassment type acts against anyone.\n\nAs soon as it became apparent to me that the concept of 'Fair Game' as described above was being misinterpreted by the uninformed, to mean the granting of a license to Scientologists for acts in violation of the law and/or other standards of decency, these policies were cancelled.\nAs revised in 1991, Scientology's policy on the handling of \"suppressive persons\" states:\n\nA series of court cases in England in the 1970s saw Fair Game being strongly criticized by senior judges. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales suggested in one case that Scientology organisations were willing to harass their critics. They also described a case brought by the Church against author Russell Miller as a deliberate form of harassment. In a case where the Church of Scientology of California sought to block publication of a book quoting Scientology materials, Lord Justice Goff cited the Fair Game policy along with what he described as the Church's \"deplorable means adopted to suppress inquiry or criticism.\" He concluded that publication of the materials was in the public interest.\n\nAccording to an FDA investigation, in 1965, ex-Scientologist Charles Berner received a \"Fair Game Order\". Afterwards, Berner stated he received other life-threatening letters, \"indicating he should apply technique R2-45 to himself. This particular technique is a route whereby an individual places a 45 caliber pistol to his head and himself from his body.\"\n\nIn 1974, the Church lost a case against an ex-Scientologist named L. Gene Allard who in 1969, shortly after leaving the Church of Scientology, had been arrested on a charge of grand theft made by the Church of Scientology. The charge was dismissed \"in the interest of justice\", and Allard sued the Church for malicious prosecution. At the trial, Allard's lawyer introduced the October 1967 and October 1968 \"Fair Game\" policy statements into evidence. Allard was awarded US$50,000 in compensatory damages and $250,000 in punitive damages. Attorneys acting for the Church of Scientology had argued that the Fair Game policy had been canceled, was irrelevant to the suit and had not been applied to Allard. An appellate court, while reducing the amount of punitive charges from $250,000 to $50,000, upheld the verdict against the Church, arguing that the church had been given ample opportunity \"to produce evidence that the fair-game policy had been repealed\" but had \"failed to do so\". In July 1976, the California Supreme Court refused to review the case.\n\nIn Operation Freakout, the Church of Scientology attempted to cause journalist and writer Paulette Cooper to be imprisoned, killed, driven to suicide or committed to a mental institution, as revenge for her publication in 1971 of a highly critical book, \"The Scandal of Scientology\". The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) discovered documentary evidence of the plot and the preceding campaign of harassment during an investigation into the Church of Scientology in 1977, eventually leading to the Church compensating Cooper in an out-of-court settlement.\n\nThe Church of Scientology of California sued the Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS) in British courts for defamation. The DHSS had suggested that Scientologists were dangerous charlatans who would worsen rather than cure mental illness. The Church demanded as part of discovery that the DHSS release letters and medical records from people who had complained about the Church. Lord Justice Stephenson declined the request, citing the Fair Game policy, which he believed still applied despite its name being cancelled. He was concerned that the documents would be used \"not for legitimate purposes of the action but for harassment of individual patients, informants and renegades named in them, not only by proceedings for defamation against them but by threats and blackmail.\"\n\nLawrence Wollersheim, a former Scientologist, successfully argued that he had been harassed and his photography business nearly destroyed as a result of Fair Game measures. These included getting Scientologist employees to resign, and Scientologist customers to boycott or refuse to pay him. The 1986 judgment by a Los Angeles jury was upheld by the California Court of Appeal in 1989. During appeals, the Church again claimed Fair Game was a \"core practice\" of Scientology and was thus constitutionally protected \"religious expression\". The court decided that the Church's campaign \"to ruin Wollersheim economically, and possibly psychologically\" should be discouraged rather than protected. Twenty years after the start of the case, the Church paid Wollersheim a judgment, with interest, that amounted to $8,674,643.\n\nIn the March 11–16, 1981, Danish court case of \"Jakob Anderson v. The Church of Scientology of Denmark\", ex-Guardian's Office operative Vibeke Damman testified that the Church did in fact practice Fair Game and had done so in Anderson's case, in an attempt to get Anderson committed to a psychiatric hospital.\n\nIn 1980, Scientologist and Sea Org officer Gerry Armstrong was assigned to organize some of Hubbard's personal papers as the basis for a biography of Hubbard. Omar Garrison, a non-Scientologist known to be sympathetic to Scientology, was hired to write the biography. Both Armstrong and Garrison quickly realized that the papers reflected unfavorably on Hubbard, and revealed that many of Hubbard's claimed accomplishments were exaggerations or outright fabrications. Garrison abandoned the project, and a disillusioned Armstrong and his wife left the Church, retaining copies of the embarrassing materials as insurance against the expected harassment to come.\nArmstrong was sued by the Church in 1982 for the theft of private documents. The \"Fair Game\" policy became an issue in court. Armstrong won the case, in part because the Judge ruled that Armstrong, as a Scientologist of long standing, knew that fair game was practiced, and had good reason to believe that possession of these papers would be necessary to defend himself against illegal persecution by the Church. In a scathing decision, Judge Paul Breckenridge wrote:\n\nIn addition to violating and abusing its own members' civil-rights, the organization over the years with its \"Fair Game\" doctrine has harassed and abused those persons not in the Church whom it perceives as enemies. [...] [Armstrong] was declared an enemy by the Church. He believed, reasonably, that he was subject to \"fair game.\"\n\nA child custody case in London's High Court examined the culture of Scientology to investigate the risks to children being raised within it. Stating his conclusions in a public hearing, Mr. Justice Latey read some of Scientology's internal documents into the record. Despite the alleged cancellation of Fair Game, he reported that, \"Deprival of property, injury by any means, trickery, suing, lying or destruction have been pursued throughout and to this day with the fullest possible vigour.\" As an example, he cited the case of a doctor at Harvard Medical School who at one point was regarded as the Church's \"Number One Enemy\". The Church had persecuted him by stealing his employment records from a hospital, launching frivolous lawsuits against him and tracking down his patients and neighbors. The Citizens' Commission on Human Rights, which Latey described as \"a Scientology 'front'\", made multiple complaints of misconduct against the doctor.\n\nIn 2009, the \"Tampa Bay Times\" reported that after Pat Broeker left the church in 1989 and moved to Colorado, David Miscavige hired private detectives for $32,000 a month. They followed him for the next two decades to Wyoming and ten years in Czech Republic, where he went to medical school and worked as an English teacher. In 2012, Paul Marrick and Greg Arnold, the two private detectives who followed Broeker for 25 years, sued the Church of Scientology for breach of contract when the organization stopped paying them for their investigations.\n\nIn 1991, investigative journalist Richard Behar wrote \"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\", a \"Time\" cover story on Scientology. The acclaimed article won several awards. The Church of Scientology brought several lawsuits over the article, all of which were eventually dismissed. While investigating the story, he experienced some of Scientology's Fair Game tactics:\nI later learned, a copy of my personal credit report – with detailed information about my bank accounts, home mortgage, credit-card payments, home address and Social Security number – had been illegally retrieved from a national credit bureau called Trans Union. The sham company that received it, \"Educational Funding Services\" of Los Angeles, gave as its address a mail drop a few blocks from Scientology's headquarters. The owner of the mail drop is a private eye named Fred Wolfson, who admits that an Ingram associate retained him to retrieve credit reports on several individuals. Wolfson says he was told that Scientology's attorneys \"had judgments against these people and were trying to collect on them.\" He says now, \"These are vicious people. These are vipers.\" Ingram, through a lawyer, denies any involvement in the scam. … After that, however, an attorney subpoenaed me, while another falsely suggested that I might own shares in a company I was reporting about that had been taken over by Scientologists (he also threatened to contact the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission). A close friend in Los Angeles received a disturbing telephone call from a Scientology staff member seeking data about me – an indication that the cult may have illegally obtained my personal phone records. Two detectives contacted me, posing as a friend and a relative of a so-called cult victim, to elicit negative statements from me about Scientology. Some of my conversations with them were taped, transcribed and presented by the church in affidavits to TIME's lawyers as \"proof\" of my bias against Scientology.\n\nActress and photographer Carmen Llywelyn was introduced to the Church of Scientology through her partner (and future husband) professional skateboarder and actor Jason Lee. In 2015, Llywelyn penned an article entitled \"Why I Left Scientology\". According to her account, when she revealed to her talent manager that she had read \"A Piece of Blue Sky\", a book critical of the Church, she was labeled a Suppressive Person and shunned (or \"disconnected\") by her friends within the church. Llywelyn's manager, a member of the Church, also \"disconnected\" and allegedly convinced United Talent Agency to drop Llywelyn as a client.\n\nLlwelyn reports being subjected to a campaign of surveillance and harassment. Writes Llywelyn: \"Scientology has a sophisticated intelligence agency known as the Office of Special Affairs, which is essentially a complex system dedicated to ruining the lives of those it sees as enemies in any way possible. Those who work for the OSA do not follow the law.\"\n\nJournalist John Sweeney said of fair gaming: \"While making our BBC Panorama film \"Scientology and Me\" I have been shouted at, spied on, had my hotel invaded at midnight, denounced as a \"bigot\" by star Scientologists and been chased round the streets of Los Angeles by sinister strangers.\" Sweeney also claimed that his family and neighbours had been harassed by unidentified strangers back in the UK, including an intruder at his wedding who fled when confronted.\n\nMark C. \"Marty\" Rathbun, a former senior executive of the Church of Scientology, left the organization in 2004. A one-hour feature titled \"Scientologists at War\" was broadcast on June 17, 2013, on British Channel Four. The feature, a rare insider view of the Church of Scientology, investigated the pressure tactics used by the \"Squirrel Busters\" affiliated to the organization to discredit and silence members who leave the church. It highlighted the story of Mark Rathbun, his role in Scientology, his fall out with Scientology leader David Miscavige, his attempts to further the cause of an independent Scientology movement, his confrontations with the \"Squirrel Busters\" and the repercussions on his family life.\n\nVideographer Bert Leahy reported being paid $2,000 a week by the \"Squirrel Busters\" to help document their activities. Leahy reported that his employer had \"flat-out said our goal is to make Marty's life a living hell\".\n\nIn 2013, Mark Rathbun's wife, a non-Scientologist, filed suit against the Church of Scientology, alleging four years of harassment by the church. In October 2014, Rathbun filmed an encounter which he claimed showed three members of the church's top management as they \"ambushed\" him at Los Angeles International Airport. The church defended this activity as being protected by first amendment (religious freedom) and free speech rights. , the court has denied a Church motion to have the case dismissed under anti-SLAPP law, but the ruling Miscavage must testify in the case was overturned on appeal. After more than 32 months of litigation, Monique Rathbun dropped the lawsuit against the church, after firing her attorneys on January 2016, due to financial constraints. She filed a motion to end the legal proceedings which the state Supreme court granted on May 6, and Monique Rathbun filed for dismissal on May 10.\n\nDavid Miscavige's father, Ronald Miscavige Sr., was a longtime Scientologist who left the Church in 2012. In July 2013, Wisconsin police responding to a suspicious person call found Dwayne S. Powell outside Ronald's home. Powell was in possession of firearms and an illegal homemade silencer. Powell claimed to have received $10,000 a week, for over a year, to conduct full-time surveillance on the elder Miscavige for Scientology. Powell told police that on one occasion, he witnessed what he believed to be Ron Sr. undergoing cardiac arrest. According to Powell, after immediately reporting the perceived emergency to his superiors, he received a call for further instructions from a man who identified himself as David Miscavige. According to the police report, Powell was instructed \"to let him die and not intervene in any way.\"\n\nIn March 2015, private investigator Eric Saldarriaga pleaded guilty to the federal charge of conspiracy to commit computer hacking after he illegally gained access to at least 60 email accounts. Among those targeted were Mike Rinder, the former spokesman for the Church of Scientology, and journalist Tony Ortega. Both men had participated in the HBO documentary film \"Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief\".\n\nAn \"Ethics Order\" dating from March 6, 1968, issued by L. Ron Hubbard aboard his boat the \"Royal Scotsman\", lists twelve Scientologists who were accused of distributing altered versions of upper level materials. Hubbard writes \"They are fair game. No amnesty may ever cover them. [...] Any Sea Org member contacting them is to use Auditing Process R2-45.\". The R2-45 Auditing Process consists of shooting a person with the intent to kill them.\n\nIt later emerged that \"Fair Game\" had actually continued in use until at least 1980, despite its cancellation, and there have been frequent allegations that it has remained in force since then. During the 1970s the Guardian's Office (GO) of the Church of Scientology, headed by Hubbard's wife Mary Sue, conducted a wide-ranging and systematic series of espionage and intimidation operations against perceived enemies of Scientology. (See Operation Freakout for a noteworthy example.)\n\nAccording to an \"American Lawyer\" investigation, \"Fair Game\" tactics had been used to force the withdrawal of the presiding judge in an attempt to \"throw\" the case. As the US Government's attorneys put it,\n\n\"Defendants, through one of their attorneys, have stated that the fair game policy continued in effect well after the indictment in this case and the conviction of the first nine co-defendants. Defendants claim that the policy was abrogated by the Church's Board of Directors in late July or early August, 1980, only after the defendants' personal attack on Judge Richey.\"\n\nThe abrogation mentioned above was issued in a policy letter of 22 July 1980, \"Ethics, Cancellation of Fair Game, more about\", issued by the Boards of Directors of the Churches of Scientology. However, this cancellation was itself cancelled in a subsequent HCO Policy Letter of 8 September 1983, \"Cancellation of Issues on Suppressive Acts and PTSes\", which cancelled a number of HCOPLs on the ground that they \"were not written by the Founder [Hubbard]\". In two subsequent court cases the Church defended \"Fair Game\" as a \"core practice of Scientology\", and claimed that it was therefore protected as \"religious expression\".\n\nSince then, a number of ex-Scientologists who formerly held senior management positions in the Church have alleged that while working for the Church they saw \"Fair Game\" tactics continuing to be used. In 1994, Vicky Aznaran, who had been the Chairman of the Board of the Religious Technology Center (the Church's central management body), claimed in an affidavit that\n\nJanie Peterson, a former Scientologist, testified in a Clearwater City hearing in 1982 that while working in the Guardians Office she had conducted smear campaigns against Church opponents, sometimes using information from confidential confessional files. A lawyer for the Church denounced the hearings as a \"witch hunt\".\nThe former scientologist stated that the Fair Game policy still applied despite the cancellation of the name.\n\nIn the UK, targets of Fair Game and related harassment over the years have included ex-members, authors, journalists, broadcasters, the mental health profession, cult-monitoring groups, government and law enforcement.\n\nMaurice William Johnson was a Scientologist who resigned in June 1966 and successfully sued for his money back. He told a court that after leaving he had received over 100 abusive letters, many of them using violent language. An article in \"The Auditor\", a Scientology publication, was produced to the court, stating outright that Johnson was \"fair game\" and describing him as \"an enemy of mankind, the planets and all life.\"\n\nJon Atack, an ex-Scientologist who left in 1983, wrote the book \"A Piece of Blue Sky: Scientology, Dianetics and L. Ron Hubbard Exposed\", and the pamphlet \"The Total Freedom Trap\" as well as providing research for \"Bare-Faced Messiah\". He provided help to other members in leaving the organisation, as well as acting as an expert witness in various cases concerning Scientology. In response, Atack's home was repeatedly picketed by placard-carrying Scientologists over the course of six days. Eugene Ingram, a private investigator employed by the Church, made visits to Atack, his elderly mother and other family and friends, spreading rumours that Atack would be going to prison. Scientologists also distributed leaflets entitled \"The Truth about Jon Atack\", implying that he was a drug dealer who only criticised Scientology for money.\n\nAtack eventually went bankrupt due to the cost of defending himself against legal action from the Church. According to Baroness Sharples speaking in the House of Lords, a number of ex-Scientologists \"have been both threatened and harassed and a considerable number of them have been made bankrupt by the church.\"\n\nJournalist Paul Bracchi investigated Scientology in the mid-1990s while working at the \"Evening Argus\" in East Grinstead. He recounted the case of a Scientologist who had been accused of stealing documents from Saint Hill Manor, and was told in writing that he was a suppressive person and Fair Game. The man's wife told Bracchi, \"For months after, we had anonymous notes delivered in the post almost daily. They said, 'You bastard,' 'You're dead,' 'Nothing will save you.' It was terribly frightening.\"\n\nSandy Smith, the editor of the 2007 BBC television programme \"Panorama\", alleged that his team had been subjected to Fair Game tactics from the Church while filming the documentary \"Scientology and Me\". When the team were filming in the United States, Scientology representatives followed them and repeatedly harangued them. Unknown men also trailed the team, one even appearing at journalist John Sweeney's wedding. Sweeney later complained of being \"chased round the streets of Los Angeles by sinister strangers [...] In LA, the moment our hire car left the airport we realised we were being followed by two cars. In our hotel a weird stranger spent every breakfast listening to us.\" When the crew returned to London, Church executive Mike Rinder was sent from the United States to lobby the BBC, even camping out at their offices.\n\n\n\n"}

It was adapted as a film of the same name released by HBO in 1998, starring Bill Paxton and Amy Madigan.\n\nJohn Paul Vann became an adviser to the Saigon regime in the early 1960s. He was an ardent critic of how the war was fought by the Saigon regime, which he viewed as corrupt and incompetent, and increasingly, on the part of the U.S. military. He was critical of the U.S. military command, especially under William Westmoreland and its inability to adapt to the fact that it was facing a popular guerrilla movement while backing a corrupt regime. He argued that many of the tactics employed (for example the Strategic Hamlet Program of relocation) further alienated the population and were counterproductive to U.S. objectives. He was often unable to influence the military command but used the Saigon press corps including Sheehan, David Halberstam and Malcolm Browne to disseminate his views.\n\nThe volume begins with a prologue giving an account of Vann's funeral on June 16, 1972, following his death in a helicopter crash in Vietnam. The author, Sheehan, a friend, was present. The subsequent account is divided into seven \"books\" detailing Vann's career in Vietnam and America's involvement in the conflict.\n\nSheehan describes Vann as having been in charge of more American troops in direct combat than any other civilian (which Vann, by then retired from the Army, technically was) in US history.\n\nAccording to \"The New York Times Book Review\", \"If there is one book that captures the Vietnam war in the sheer Homeric scale of its passion and folly, this book is it. Neil Sheehan orchestrates a great fugue evoking all the elements of the war\". \"The New York Review of Books\" proclaimed it \"An unforgettable narrative, a chronicle grand enough to suit the crash and clangors of whole armies. \"A Bright Shining Lie\" is a very great piece of work; its rewards are aesthetic and...almost spiritual\".\n\nIt received the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights 1989 Book Award given annually to a book that \"most faithfully and forcefully reflects Robert Kennedy's purposes – his concern for the poor and the powerless, his struggle for honest and even-handed justice, his conviction that a decent society must assure all young people a fair chance, and his faith that a free democracy can act to remedy disparities of power and opportunity.\"\n\nIn September, 1988, Sheehan was interviewed by Brian Lamb about \"A Bright Shining Lie\". The discussion was aired on C-SPAN in five 30-minute segments and was the basis for the later C-SPAN show \"Booknotes\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2033124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033124", "title": "Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health", "text": "Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\n\nDianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health (sometimes abbreviated as DMSMH) is a book by L. Ron Hubbard about Dianetics, a system of psychotherapy he developed from a combination of personal experience, basic principles of Eastern philosophy, and the work of Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. The book is a canonical text of Scientology. It is colloquially referred to as Book One. The book launched the movement, which later defined itself as a religion, in 1950. As of 2013, New Era Publications, the international publishing company of Hubbard's works, sells the book in English and in fifty other languages.\n\nIn this best-selling book, Hubbard wrote that he had isolated the \"dynamic principle of existence,\" which he states as \"Survive,\" and presents his description of the human mind. He identifies the source of \"human aberration\" as the \"reactive mind,\" a normally hidden but always conscious area of the mind, and certain traumatic memories (\"engrams\") stored in it. \"Dianetics\" describes counselling (or \"auditing\") techniques which Hubbard claimed would get rid of engrams and bring major therapeutic benefits.\n\nHubbard was criticized by scientists and medical professionals, who charge that he presents these claims in superficially scientific language but without evidence. Despite this, \"Dianetics\" proved a major commercial success on its publication, although B. Dalton employees have stated that these figures were inflated by Hubbard's Scientologist-controlled publisher, who had groups of Scientologists each purchase dozens or even hundreds of copies of Hubbard's books, and who sold these back to the same retailers.\n\nBefore the publication of \"Dianetics\", L. Ron Hubbard was a prolific writer for pulp magazines. He attended George Washington University Engineering School, but did not graduate.\n\nAccording to Hubbard, the ideas in \"Dianetics\" were developed over twelve years of research, although many of his friends at the time said this was entirely mythical. The first public outline of those ideas was an article in the pulp magazine \"Astounding Science Fiction\", titled \"Dianetics: A new science of the mind\" appearing a few weeks before the publication of the book but published in the May 1950 issue of the magazine, the same month the book was published; the book-length article was later published as the book \"\". This advance publicity generated so much interest that in April 1950, Hubbard and \"Astounding\" editor John W. Campbell with other interested parties established the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation. Hubbard claimed to have written \"Dianetics\" in three weeks. His writing speed was assisted by a special typewriter which accepted paper on a continuous roll and which had dedicated keys for common words like \"the\" or \"but\". It is called the Remington typewriter, which is on display in the Bay Head, New Jersey Scientology pilgrimage site. An early version of the book, \"Abnormal Dianetics\", intended for the medical profession, was rejected by numerous publishers as well as the medical profession but was passed in mimeograph form from hand to hand and was later sold under the name \"Dianetics: The Original Thesis\"; the same book is published at present as \"The Dynamics of Life\". Like other works by L. Ron Hubbard, \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\" has been subject to continuous editing since its inception so that at present it hardly resembles the original 1950 edition.\n\nAccording to religion scholar Dorthe Refslund Christensen, in Scientology, DMSMH represents “the most elaborate of Hubbard’s presentations on the human mind, its functions, and the problems related to these functions.” The opening chapter presents the context of Dianetics as human beings being preoccupied with “finding a science of the mind that could not only isolate the common denominator of life and the goal of thought” but also isolate the only source of “strange illnesses and aberrations.” Hubbard claims that the two answers to the question of human misery across time and civilizations have been religion and magical practices and modern psychotherapy that includes the practice of electroshocks and brain surgeries, which according to him, have turned patients into “helpless zombies.” Dianetics, he claims is the answer to this dilemma.\n\nIn the section \"How to Read this Book,\" L. Ron Hubbard suggests to read right on through. An \"Important Note\" appeared in later editions of the book advising the reader to understand every word read. In the book, Hubbard uses two different and contradictory definitions for the word \"engram\". In Book One, the Goal of Man, chapter 5, summary, Hubbard states the Fundamental Axioms of Dianetics, among which is \"... The engram is a moment of 'unconsciousness' containing physical pain or painful emotion and all perceptions and is not available to the analytical mind as experience.\" Later in the text, Hubbard writes of the engram in a footnote on page 74 of Book Two, chapter two, of the 2007 edition of \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\". The footnote reads: \"... The word engram in Dianetics is used in its severely accurate sense as a 'definite and permanent trace left by a stimulus on the protoplasm of a tissue'. It is considered as a unit group of stimuli impinged solely on the cellular being.\" In other words, Hubbard takes a definition previously debunked by biology and calls it a Dianetics definition. Dianetics, in and of itself, thus presents nothing that was not already known to science in that area, while adding phenomena and functional systems that have no basis in fact. The very manner of \"scientific method\" displayed by Hubbard in his works has indeed been called \"anti-science,\" in that the claims made in the books are based not on peer-reviewed observation of phenomena, with its attendant blind testing, control groups etc., but rather on deciding \"a priori\" that a phenomenon exists–followed by an attempt to prove its validity.\n\nIn \"Dianetics\", to explain the abilities of a Clear, Hubbard makes use of tropes and special idioms and draws the attention away by pointing to old colloquialisms as the \"mind's eye.\" Hubbard uses such terms as \"optimum recall,\" \"optimum individual,\" \"... What a Clear can do easily, quite a few people have, from time to time, been partially able to do in the past.,\" \"... A clear uses imagination in its entirety,\" \"... Rationality, as divorced from aberration, can be studied in a Cleared person only,\" a Clear's intelligence is above normal, a Clear is free from all aberrations and the attributes of a Clear have never been previously included in a study of man and man's inherent abilities. After faithfully enumerating all kinds of benefits about Clear, Hubbard finally admits \"... Until we obtain Clears, it remains obscure why such differences should exist\" as if no Clear has ever been made or no Clear ever made it. L. Ron Hubbard was extremely apt and able in using these tropes to suit \"Dianetics\" presentation of a new reality.\n\nThrough Dianetics and the concept of engrams, Hubbard claimed that most illnesses were psychosomatic. He listed the following as caused by engrams: arthritis, dermatitis, allergies, asthma, coronary difficulties, eye trouble, bursitis, ulcers, sinusitis and migraine headaches. He further claimed that dianetic therapy could treat these illnesses, and also included cancer and diabetes as conditions that Dianetic research was focused on.\n\nIn 1951, \"Consumer Report\" announced a one-month $500 course, based on the recently published \"Dianetics\", open to anyone and intended to produce the Clear, the goal of Dianetic therapy. The Report on \"a new cult\" places Dianetics beyond the scope of medical practice.\n\nAccording to Hubbard, the book \"Dianetics: the modern science of mental health\" follows the original line of research:\n\nA) The discovery of the dynamic principle of existence and its meaning.\n\nB) The discovery of the source of aberration: the reactive mind.\n\nC) Therapy and its application.\n\nHubbard leaves out all the basic philosophy.\n\n\"Dianetics\" purports to reveal revolutionary discoveries about the source of psychosomatic illness, neuroses and other mental ailments, as well as an exact, infallible way of permanently curing them. Hubbard divides the human mind into an \"analytic mind\" which supposedly functions perfectly, and a \"reactive mind\" which is incapable of thinking or making distinctions. When the analytic mind is unconscious, the reactive mind physically records memories called \"engrams.\" As a result of all stimuli it receives, the Reactive Mind is one mass of engrams, feeding the otherwise perfect Analytical Mind incorrect data. Misinterpretation of these Reactive Mind engrams by the analytical mind causes damage later in life. Actually, these engrams cause compulsions and repressions in later life. According to Hubbard, a person is affected in later life by the unconscious effects of these engrams. By a process called \"Dianetic auditing,\" the book promises, people can achieve a superhuman state called \"Clear\" with superior IQ, morally pure intentions and greatly improved mental and physical health. In August 1950, Hubbard predicted that Clears would become the world's new aristocracy, although he admitted that he had not achieved the state himself. In welcoming expectancy, the \"Theosophist Magazine\" compares the Dianetic engram to the Theosophic permanent atom as these atoms receive and retransmit impressions received life after life so that as the ego descends to a new birth, the new incarnation receives the stored impressions of engrams from previous lives. As the appearance of a new science, it was not so explicitly stated in DMSMH but eventually, Hubbard would go into the exploration of past lives with Dianetics.\n\nA) The dynamic principle of existence:\nSurvive!\n\nAccording to Hubbard, the basic discovery is not that man survives, but that he is solely motivated by survival.\n\nB) The single source of aberration:\nThe Reactive Mind\n\nAccording to Hubbard, the Reactive Mind works solely on a stimulus-response basis and it stores not memories but engrams.\n\nIn \"Dianetics\", Hubbard mentions the post-hypnotic suggestion. This phenomenon of the post-hypnotic suggestion was described as far back as 1787. The development of Dynamic psychiatry dates back to the encounter between the physician Mesmer and the exorcist Johann Joseph Gassner. According to followers of the school of Dynamic Psychiatry, the advent of hypnotism signaled the discovery of the unconscious. At the Oak Knoll Naval Hospital, where he was being treated for ulcers, Hubbard studied hypnosis, psychological theory and other similar subjects; Hubbard was quite adept at hypnotism. According to Hubbard, it was trying to find what makes hypnotism such a wide variable that led to the discovery of the Reactive Mind. Dr. Roy Grinker and Dr. John Spiegel developed Narcosynthesis which was widely used by psychiatrists in World War II. In the book \"Dianetics\" Hubbard mentions Narcosynthesis or drug-hypnosis. However, Hubbard states that the technique of drug-hypnosis has been known for ages, both in ancient Greece and in the Orient. The technique of narcosynthesis is not used in \"Dianetics\" even though Hubbard may have been trained in it while in Naval Intelligence. A shot of sodium pentothal is administered as a truth serum. The technique is described on page 150 of the 2007 edition of \"Dianetics: the modern science of mental health\".\n\nC) Therapy and its application\n\nThe medical establishment completely rejected the new \"science\" for lack of experimental proof. \"Dianetics\" has never passed any scientific rigor. In 1953, Harvey Jay Fischer wrote the report \"Dianetic Therapy: an experimental evaluation\" concluding that \"... \"Dianetic\" does not systematically favorably or adversely influence the ability to perform\" either intellectually, mathematically or resolving personality conflicts. According to Hubbard's son, DMSMH is not the result of any research whatsoever but a man's obsession with abortion and other phenomena of the unconscious, specially the occult and black magic. There is an entire chapter in DMSMH devoted to demonology. To maintain the \"scientific\" appearance of DMSMH, Hubbard decries the belief in demons. In DMSMH, demons are explained as electronic circuits. However, in Hubbard's later writings, entities begin to appear that possess man's physical body. These entities are spirits which Hubbard calls \"thetans.\" What Hubbard does assert is that demonology is good business. A person is a thetan but the person's physical body is possessed by thetans called body thetans. To be spiritually free, a person would have to audit out all those other thetans in the body and that would take a great deal of time and a great deal of money.\n\nIn advising the auditor to be uncommunicative, Hubbard was divorcing Dianetics from other psycho-therapies, as in psychoanalysis, where the therapist most obstinately offers a personal interpretation of what is happening in the patient's mind.\n\nScientologist Harvey Jackins said of Dianetics therapy: \"... The results have been nearly uniform and positive. Apparently, the auditor (listener or therapist) can be very forthright and direct in seeking out the past traumatic experiences which are continuing to mar the rationality and well being of the person. Once located, the exhaustion of the distress and re-evaluation of the experience apparently leads uniformly to dramatic improvement in ability, emotional tone and well-being.\"\n\nHubbard considered that to maintain silence around unconscious or injured persons is of the utmost importance in the prevention of aberration. After the publication of DMSMH, Hubbard moved to Cuba. There, the signs in every hospital zone are still prominently displayed: Hospital Silence. In a letter dated December 7, 1950, Ernest Hemingway's son Greg writes to his father mentioning that the publisher of Dianetics is coming down to Cuba to present Ernest with a copy in earnest. Hemingway's son's girlfriend is the publisher's daughter; Greg himself is working at the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation. On December 14, Hemingway answered: \"... The Dianetics king never sent the book so I bought one, but Miss Nita borrowed it and it is still outside of the joint. So have not been able to practice jumping back into the womb or any of those popular New York indoor sports and have to just continue to write them as I see them.\"\n\nAccording to Martin Gardner, the workability of Dianetics lies in the field of faith healing as most neurotics will react positively to something they have faith in. There is nothing extraordinary about Dianetics case histories as it is something quite common in faith healing.\n\nFinally, Hubbard gives fair warning to those who attempt to self-audit his DIY (do-it-yourself) Dianetic process. It cannot be done, says Hubbard, because every engram contains analytical attenuation. It is better to learn to audit the technique and apply it to others. Anyone engaged in self-auditing will only succeed in getting sick. However, in later developments of technique application Hubbard would develop \"Solo Auditing\" where auditor and pre-clear are one and the same except that in the procedure as always Hubbard would be obeyed to the letter. In Dianetics and Scientology, self-auditing always carries a bad connotation while solo auditing does not. As usual, Hubbard's particular use of nomenclature would win the day.\n\nHubbard says in DMSMH that all civilizations have had two responses to the reality of human misery: first, “religion and magical practices,” second, “modern psychotherapy,” which according to him, “have exceeded the brutality of magic and religious practices by turning patients into helpless zombies.” He also said that because man does not understand himself, he has developed “terrifying weapons,” which is the reason that the earth is in war.\n\n\"Dianetics\" was first published May 9, 1950 by Hermitage House, at One Madison Ave., a New York-based publisher of psychiatric textbooks whose president, Arthur Ceppos, was also on the Board of Directors of the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation. The book became a nationwide bestseller, selling over 150,000 copies within a year. Due to the interest generated, a multitude of \"Dianetics clubs\" and similar organizations were formed for the purpose of applying Dianetics techniques. Hubbard himself established a nationwide network of Dianetic Research Foundations, offering Dianetics training and processing for a fee. Dianetics blossomed into a national fad and was then denounced by psychologists.\n\nThe original edition of the book included an introduction by J. A. Winter, M.D., who became the first medical director of the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation, an appendix on \"The Philosophic Method\" by Will Durant (reprinted from \"The Story of Philosophy,\" 1926), another on \"The Scientific Method\" by John W. Campbell and a third appendix by Donald H. Rogers. These contributions are omitted from editions of \"Dianetics\" published since about the start of the 1980s.\n\nAlthough it received an initial positive public response, \"Dianetics\" was strongly criticized by scientists and medical professionals for its scientific deficiencies. The American Psychological Association passed a resolution in 1950 stating of Dianetics \"the fact that these claims are not supported by empirical evidence of the sort required for the establishment of scientific generalizations.\"\n\nDespite a couple of favourable reviews from medical doctors, \"Dianetics\" has had very hostile reviews from many, or almost all, sources. An early review in \"The New Republic\" summed up the book as \"a bold and immodest mixture of complete nonsense and perfectly reasonable common sense, taken from long-acknowledged findings and disguised and distorted by a crazy, newly invented terminology\" and warned of medical risks: \"it may prove fatal to have put too much trust in the promises of this dangerous book.\" Frederick L. Schuman, political science professor at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts became an ardent follower of \"Dianetics\" and wrote indignant letters to those who reviewed \"Dianetics\" adversely including the \"New Republic\" and \"The New York Times\". Professor Schuman wrote a favorable article on \"Dianetics\" in the April 1951 issue of \"Better Homes and Gardens\".\n\nReviewing the book for \"Scientific American\" in 1951, physicist Isidor Isaac Rabi criticised the lack of either evidence or qualification, saying it \"probably contains more promises and less evidence per page than has any publication since the invention of printing.\" An editorial in \"Clinical Medicine\" summarised the book as \"a rumination of old psychological concepts, (...) misunderstood and misinterpreted and at the same time adorned with the halo of the philosopher's stone and of an universal remedy,\" which had initiated \"a new system of quackery of apparently considerable dimensions.\" According to \"Consumer Reports\", the book over-extends scientific and cybernetic metaphors, and lacks the needed case reports, experimental replication and statistical data to back up its bold claims. Both \"Consumer Reports\" and \"Clinical Medicine\" also warned of the danger that the book would inspire unqualified people to harmfully intervene in others' mental problems.\n\nThese warnings were echoed by psychoanalyst Erich Fromm, who contrasted the sophistication of Sigmund Freud's theories with the \"oversimplified\" and \"propagandistic\" ideas offered by \"Dianetics\". The latter's extremely mechanistic view of the mind had no need for human values, conscience or any authority other than Hubbard himself. A similar point was made by psychologist Rollo May in \"The New York Times\", arguing that \"Dianetics\" unwittingly illustrates the fallacy of trying to understand human nature by invariant mathematical models taken from mechanics.\n\nA review by semantics expert S. I. Hayakawa described \"Dianetics\" as an example of \"fiction-science\", meaning that it borrows several linguistic techniques from science fiction to make fanciful claims seem plausible. Science fiction, he explained, relies on vividly conveying imaginary entities such as Martians and rayguns as though they were commonplace. Hubbard was doing this with his fantastic \"discoveries\", perhaps fooling even himself.\n\nScience writer Martin Gardner criticised the book's \"repetitious, immature style\" likening it to the grand pseudoscientific pronouncements of Wilhelm Reich. \"Nothing in the book remotely resembles a scientific report,\" he wrote.\n\nAleksei Shliapov, a columnist at the Russian paper \"Izvestia\", said about \"Dianetics\", \"I think that our politicians should acquaint themselves with this book, since here is, as it were, a technology for how to become popular, how to acquire influence among the masses without having to appear a significant personality.\"\n\nMore recently, the book has been described by \"Salon\" as \"a fantastically dull, terribly written, crackpot rant,\" which covers a lack of credible evidence with mere insistence\nand \"The Daily Telegraph\" called it a \"creepy bit of mind-mechanics\" which would cause rather than cure depression.\n\nWhen Hubbard wrote the book in 1950, homosexuality was considered a pathological illness and in 1951 the DSM I listed it under Sexual Deviation which stance was reflected in passages of \"Dianetics\" where homosexuality is considered a mental illness. Besides the homosexual as sexual pervert, Hubbard also includes things such as lesbianism, sexual sadism and all the catalog of Ellis and Krafft-Ebing as being actually \"quite ill physically.\"\n\nKarl Lashley spent decades looking for the engram which he abandoned in 1950 for non-localized memory. This was not the same type of engram described by Hubbard. However, Hubbard derived his ideas and the term “engram,” from psychology sources, and biology. Richard Semon coined the term \"engram\" in 1904 and wrote extensively about it in 1921, decades before the publication of \"Dianetics\".\n\nIt is unclear how many editions there have been, but at least 60 printings are said to have been issued by 1988, almost all having been printed by the Church of Scientology and its related organizations.\n\nCurrent editions are published by Bridge Publications and New Era Publications, Scientology-owned imprints. Over twenty million copies have been sold according to the cover of the latest paperback books. The following statement is included on the copyright page of all editions: \"This book is part of the works of L. Ron Hubbard, who developed Dianetics spiritual healing technology and Scientology applied religious philosophy. It is presented to the reader as a record of observations and research into the nature of mind and spirit, and not a statement of claims made by the author...\"\n\nAccording to Bridge Publications, 83 million copies of \"Dianetics\" were sold in the forty years after publication. According to Nielsen BookScan, the book has sold 52,000 copies between 2001 and 2005. The book has been very aggressively marketed, often in ways that are unusual for the book industry, for instance appearing as one of the twelve sponsors of the Goodwill Games under a $4 million agreement between Bridge Publications and Turner Broadcasting System. Bridge Publications also sponsors NASCAR racer and Scientologist Kenton Gray, who races as the \"Dianetics Racing Team\" and whose No. 27 Ford Taurus is decorated with Dianetics logos.\n\nVarious sources allege that the book's continued sales have been manipulated by the Church of Scientology and its related organizations ordering followers to buy up new editions to boost sales figures. According to a \"Los Angeles Times\" exposé published in 1990, \"sales of Hubbard's books apparently got an extra boost from Scientology followers and employees of the publishing firm [Bridge Publications]. Showing up at major book outlets like B. Dalton and Waldenbooks, they purchased armloads of Hubbard's works, according to former employees.\" Members are asked to contribute by placing \"Dianetics\" in public libraries. However, \"Dianetics\" was not added to the collection of the Brooklyn Public Library on the basis of a negative review.\n\nScientologists regard the publication of \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\" as a key historical event for their movement and the world, and refer to the book as \"Book One.\" In Scientology, years are numbered relative to the first publication of the book: 1990, for example, being \"40 AD\" (After Dianetics). The book is promoted as \"a milestone for Man comparable to his discovery of fire and superior to his inventions of the wheel and the arch.\"\n\n\"Dianetics\" is still heavily promoted today by the Church of Scientology and has been advertised widely on television and in print. Indeed, it has been alleged that the Church has asked its members to purchase large quantities of the book with their own money, or with money supplied by the Church, for the sole purpose of keeping the book on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list. Hubbard described the book as a key asset for getting people in Scientology:\n\nThe Church of Scientology has been explicit about using Dianetics' sponsorship of the Goodwill Games to boost Scientology membership. The Church's internal journal for Scientologists, \"International Scientology News,\" has stated that\n\nUnder \"Role in Scientology\" should be that Dianetics is basically a method of helping people recall and recover recall of past events as well as chains of events going into the past that are somehow connected in a person's mind. How they are connected depends upon the person. \n\nThen, those doing Dianetics often ran into people who, in going back on these chains, would speak of experiences that were before they were born. Hubbard originally wrote, \"I guess some people have to be delusional before they get well.\" in his journal. \nThen, those people who remembered past events from before they were born started to include people who had been in the military as professional soldiers. Their descriptions of their pasts were checked against records at West Point, The Citadel, Sandhurst and other military institutions they attended with records from long past. Every one of the events cited by the people concurred 100% with the long past records. Things they could not have known especially were checked. As was stated, one or a few of these are a curiosity. Hundreds of them and one is forced to acknowledge that man is a more than one lifetime being.\nKeep in mind besides a belief in a supreme being, two of the definitions of religion are: A philosophy of life and how life can be lived (as in Buddhism: No god but a way to live life [the Tao]) And, belief that man is an immortal being that lives on not just a body.\nPeople then bothered Hubbard that he was dealing with the human soul and was thus in the field of religion. Hubbard resisted. He even stated in a lecture series Thought, Emotion and Effort that what he was doing was \"science of the mind\" and at most where science of the mind met religion. \nLater, Hubbard investigated what religion actually was — man's search for his beginnings and the reason for life, etc. It was obvious to him that what he was doing fit that even more than asking someone to believe something and so, against his initial ideas, he acquiesced and made Scientology into the religion it should have been from the beginning.\nThat is the role Dianetics played in Scientology.\n\n\"Dianetics\" uses the image of an exploding volcano, both on the covers of post-1967 editions, and in advertising. A giant billboard built in Sydney, Australia, measured 33 m (100 ft) wide and 10 m (30 ft) high and depicted an erupting volcano with \"non-toxic smoke.\" Hubbard told his marketing staff that this imagery would make the books irresistible to purchasers by reactivating unconscious memories.\nAccording to Hubbard, the volcano recalls the incident in which galactic overlord Xenu placed billions of his people around Earth's volcanoes and killed them there by blowing them up with hydrogen bombs. A representative of the Church of Scientology has confirmed in court that the Dianetics volcano is indeed linked with the \"catastrophe\" wrought by Xenu.\n\nBent Corydon, a former Scientology mission holder, recounted that\n\n\n"}

For example, a table will be perceived as a complete volumetric structure even if only part of it—the facing surface—projects to the retina; it is perceived as possessing internal volume and hidden rear surfaces despite the fact that only the near surfaces are exposed to view. Similarly, the world around us is perceived as a surrounding plenum, even though only part of it is in view at any time. Another much quoted example is that of the \"dog behind a picket fence\" in which a long narrow object (the dog) is partially occluded by fence-posts in front of it, but is nevertheless perceived as a single continuous object. Albert Bregman noted an auditory analogue of this phenomenon: when a melody is interrupted by bursts of white noise, it is nonetheless heard as a single melody continuing \"behind\" the bursts of noise.\n\nFormulation of the theory is credited to the Belgian psychologist Albert Michotte and Fabio Metelli, an Italian psychologist, with their work developed in recent years by E.S. Reed and the Gestaltists.\n\nModal completion is a similar phenomenon in which a shape is perceived to be occluding other shapes even when the shape itself is not drawn. Examples include the triangle that appears to be occluding three disks and an outlined triangle in the Kanizsa triangle and the circles and squares that appear in different versions of the Koffka cross.\n\n\n"}

The music and sound man was Bill St. Amour. The show's announcer was Bill Carroll (Except for one week when Briane Nasimok who was the producer and played recurring characters, took his place). It occasionally featured Canadian musicians who were prominent at the time. Dan Gallagher hosted the program and it was produced and directed by Sidney M. Cohen. The show was cancelled after two seasons. Reruns currently air Mondays and Fridays on GameTV. Reruns of episodes from the show's second season also aired during the summer of 2003 on MuchMoreMusic.\n\nThe show was a points-based contest, with the highest scorer winning a grand prize. There were four five-time champions in the first season. These four contestants were deemed the best contestants that season, and won trips to Las Vegas, Mexico, Jamaica, and Florida. All four participated in a \"Tournament of Champions\" show in season two, for which the grand prize was a home stereo.\n\nThe main game featured a \"video wall\" with a grid of nine windows with television screen facades. Each window concealed a category or other game feature. In each of the two main rounds, contestants would take turns throwing a fake brick at the game board; for most screens, this would reveal a category from which trivia questions would be asked to all three contestants by ring-in format. (Occasionally if a contestant kept missing the board, Dan would ask them which window they were aiming for and would hit it himself.) Each correct answer added points, while each incorrect answer deducted them. Questions in the first main round were worth 10 points, and in the second main round were worth 20 points. The board also concealed mini-games, which that contestant would play, and a \"switch\" space: This space knocked the player out of the game and switched them with another contestant waiting to play.\n\nThe most frequent categories are:\n\nThe show also had a round featuring a large floor-based game wheel with eight mini-games.

In the second format, the first round was following by the wheel round; the board was reset for the subsequent second main round, including the switch space which was once again available. It is unknown which of these formats preceded which.\n\nThe fourth and final round of each game was a lightning round, in which the contestants donned motorcycle-style helmets outfitted with a lightbulb and a button on the forehead. Contestants had to slap the button to ring in. As many questions as possible were asked in the 58-second time limit. The player with the highest score at the end of the round won the grand prize and returned on the next episode.

He was also a regular visiting professor of philosophy at Princeton University from 2007 through 2014. His research focuses primarily on philosophy of mind, epistemology, metaphysics, and meta-ethics.\n\nFrank Cameron Jackson was born in 1943. His father, Allan Cameron Jackson, was also a philosopher and student of Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\nJackson studied mathematics and philosophy at the University of Melbourne, going into residence at Trinity College in 1961. In his later years in College, he was Clarke Scholar, and a member of the 2nd XVIII football team. He then received his PhD in philosophy from La Trobe University. He taught at the University of Adelaide for a year in 1967. In 1978, he became chair of the philosophy department at Monash University. In 1986, he joined Australian National University (ANU) as Professor of Philosophy and Head of the Philosophy Program, Research School of Social Sciences. At ANU, he served as Director of the Institute of Advanced Studies from 1998 to 2001 and Deputy Vice-Chancellor in 2001. He was appointed as Distinguished Professor at ANU in 2003. He now has a half-time appointment at Princeton University as well as a half-time appointment at ANU.\n\nJackson was awarded the Order of Australia in 2006 for service to philosophy and social sciences as an academic, administrator, and researcher. Jackson delivered the John Locke lectures at the University of Oxford in 1995. His father had delivered the 1957–8 lectures, making them the first father-son pair to do so.\n\nJackson's philosophical research is broad, but focuses primarily on the areas of philosophy of mind, epistemology, metaphysics, and meta-ethics.\n\nIn philosophy of mind, Jackson is known, among other things, for the \"knowledge argument\" against physicalism—the view that the universe is entirely physical (i.e., the kinds of entities postulated in physics). Jackson motivates the knowledge argument by a thought experiment known as Mary's room. Jackson phrases the thought experiment as follows:\n\nJackson used the knowledge argument, as well as other arguments, to establish a sort of dualism, according to which certain mental states, especially qualitative ones, are non-physical. The view that Jackson urged was a modest version of epiphenomenalism—the view that certain mental states are non-physical and, although caused to come into existence by physical events, do not then cause any changes in the physical world.\n\nHowever, Jackson later rejected the knowledge argument, as well as other arguments against physicalism:\n\nJackson argues that the intuition-driven arguments against physicalism (such as the knowledge argument and the zombie argument) are ultimately misleading.\n\nJackson is also known for his defence of the centrality of conceptual analysis to philosophy; his approach, set out in his Locke Lectures and published as his 1998 book, is often referred to as the Canberra Plan for doing philosophy.\n\nJackson was elected Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities (FAHA) in 1981 and of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia (FASSA) in 1998.\n\nHe was awarded the Centenary Medal in 2001 and appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 2006.\n\nIn 2003 he was appointed as Distinguished Professor at the Australian National University and Emeritus Professor in 2014.

Semiconductor lasers with blue beams are typically based on gallium(III) nitride (GaN; violet color) or indium gallium nitride (often true blue in color, but also able to produce other colors). Both blue and violet lasers can also be constructed using frequency-doubling of infrared laser wavelengths from diode lasers or diode-pumped solid-state lasers.\n\nDiode lasers which emit light at 445 nm are becoming popular as handheld lasers. Lasers emitting wavelengths below 445 nm appear violet (but are sometimes called blue lasers). Some of the most commercially common blue lasers are the diode lasers used in Blu-ray applications which emit 405 nm \"violet\" light, which is a short enough wavelength to cause fluorescence in some chemicals, in the same way as radiation further into the ultraviolet (\"black light\") does. Light of a shorter wavelength than 400 nm is classified as ultraviolet.\n\nDevices that employ blue laser light have applications in many areas ranging from optoelectronic data storage at high density to medical applications.\n\nRed lasers can be built on gallium arsenide (GaAs) semiconductors, upon which a dozen layers of atoms are placed to form the part of the laser that generates light from quantum wells. Using methods similar to those developed for silicon, the substrate can be built free of the defects called dislocations, and the atoms laid down so the distance between the ones making up the ground and those of the quantum wells are the same.\n\nHowever, the best semiconductor for blue lasers is gallium nitride (GaN) crystals, which are much harder to manufacture, requiring higher pressures and temperatures, similar to the ones that produce synthetic diamonds, and the use of high-pressure nitrogen gas. The technical problems seemed insurmountable, so researchers since the 1960s have sought to deposit GaN on a base of readily available sapphire. But a mismatch between the structures of sapphire and gallium nitride created too many defects.\n\nIn 1992 Japanese inventor Shuji Nakamura invented the first efficient blue LED, and four years later, the first blue laser. Nakamura used the material deposited on the sapphire substrate, although the number of defects remained too high (10–10/cm) to easily build a high-power laser.\n\nIn the early 1990s the Institute of High Pressure Physics at the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw (Poland), under the leadership of Dr. Sylwester Porowski developed technology to create gallium nitride crystals with high structural quality and fewer than 100 defects per square centimeter — at least 10,000 times better than the best sapphire-supported crystal.\n\nIn 1999, Nakamura tried Polish crystals, producing lasers with twice the yield and ten times the lifetime — 3,000 hours at 30 mW.\n\nA further development of the technology has led to mass production of the device. Today, blue lasers use a sapphire surface covered with a layer of gallium nitride (this technology is used by Japanese company Nichia, which has an agreement with Sony), and blue semiconductor lasers use a gallium nitride mono-crystal surface (Polish company TopGaN).\n\nAfter 10 years, Japanese manufacturers mastered the production of a blue laser with 60 mW of power, making them applicable for devices that read a dense high-speed stream of data from Blu-ray, BD-R, and BD-RE. Polish technology is cheaper than Japanese but has a smaller share of the market. There is one more Polish high-tech company which creates gallium nitride crystal – Ammono, but this company does not produce blue lasers.\n\nFor his work, Nakamura received the Millennium Technology Prize awarded in 2006, and a Nobel Prize for Physics awarded in 2014.\n\nUntil the late 1990s, when blue semiconductor lasers were developed, blue lasers were large and expensive gas laser instruments which relied on population inversion in rare gas mixtures and needed high currents and strong cooling.\n\nThanks to prior development of many groups, including, most notably, Professor Isamu Akasaki's group, Shuji Nakamura at Nichia Corporation and Sony Corporation in Anan (Tokushima-ken, Japan) made a series of inventions and developed commercially viable blue and violet semiconductor lasers. The active layer of the Nichia devices was formed from InGaN quantum wells or quantum dots spontaneously formed via self-assembly. The new invention enabled the development of small, convenient and low-priced blue, violet, and ultraviolet (UV) lasers, which had not been available before, and opened the way for applications such as high-density HD DVD data storage and Blu-ray discs. The shorter wavelength allows it to read discs containing much more information.\n\nIsamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura won the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for the invention of efficient blue light-emitting diodes which has enabled bright and energy-saving white light sources\".\n\nInfrared lasers based on semiconductors are readily available since decades, for instance as pump source for telecom or solid state lasers. These can be frequency-doubled to the blue range using standard nonlinear crystals. \n\nViolet lasers may be constructed directly with GaN (gallium nitride) semiconductors, as noted. However, a few higher-powered (120 mW) 404–405 nm \"violet\" laser pointers have become available which are not based on GaN, but also use frequency-doubler technology starting from 1 watt 808 nm gallium arsenide infrared diode lasers being directly doubled, without a longer-wave diode-pumped solid state laser interposed between diode laser and doubler-crystal.\n\nHighest powers and wavelength tunability can be reached when the frequency doubling process is resonator enhanced, resulting in Watt-class sources spanning across the visible wavelength range. For instance, in 2.6 W of output power around 400 nm were demonstrated.\n\nBlue laser pointers, which became available around 2006, have the same basic construction as DPSS green lasers. They most commonly emit light at 473 nm, which is produced by frequency doubling of 946 nm laser radiation from a diode-pumped or crystal. Neodymium-doped crystals usually produce a principal wavelength of 1064 nm, but with the proper reflective coating mirrors can be also made to lase at other non-principal neodymium wavelengths, such as the 946 nm transition used in blue-laser applications. For high output power BBO crystals are used as frequency doublers; for lower powers, KTP is used. Output powers available are up to 5000 mW. Conversion efficiency for producing 473 nm laser radiation is inefficient with some of the best lab produced results coming in at 10-15% efficient at converting 946 nm laser radiation to 473 nm laser radiation. In practical applications, one can expect this to be even lower. Due to this low conversion efficiency, use of a 1000 mW IR diode results in at most 150 mW of visible blue light.\n\nBlue lasers can also be fabricated directly with InGaN semiconductors, which produce blue light without frequency-doubling. 445 nm through 465 nm blue laser diodes are currently available on the open market. The devices are significantly brighter than 405 nm laser diodes, since the longer wavelength is closer to the peak sensitivity of the human eye. Commercial devices like laser projectors have driven down the prices on these diodes.\n\nThe violet 405 nm laser (whether constructed from GaN or frequency-doubled GaAs laser diodes) is not in fact blue, but appears to the eye as violet, a color for which a human eye has a very limited sensitivity. When pointed at many white objects (such as white paper or white clothes which have been washed in certain washing powders) the visual appearance of the laser dot changes from violet to blue, due to fluorescence of brightening dyes.\n\nFor display applications which must appear \"true blue\", a wavelength of 445–450 nm is required. With advances in production, and commercial sales of low-cost laser projectors, 445 nm InGaN laser diodes have dropped in price.\n\nAreas of application of the blue laser include:\n\n\n"}

It is the fourth book and the third paper book released in the Warcraft Universe.\n\nThe story of \"Warcraft: The Last Guardian\" is about Medivh, the last guardian of Azeroth, his new apprentice Khadgar, and Medivh's fall from grace during the events of the First War.\n\nThe story follows Khadgar, as he lives in Karazhan. The ruling council of Dalaran has sent Khadgar there to gather information regarding Medivh and his secrets. It is regarded by him as one of the best times of his life, until he learned of Medivh's corruption.\n\nThe Last Guardian himself, Medivh is a reclusive but powerful mage, empowered by the secretive Council of Tirisfal to safeguard Azeroth. Medivh was a childhood friend of King Llane and Lord Lothar. Despite all this, Medivh has some dark secrets to hide.\n\nGarona is an emissary sent by the Orc Warlock Gul'dan to learn more about Medivh. Half-orc and half-human, she is considered an outcast by the orcish clans. Garona's allegiances quickly shift to the humans she meets. She befriends Khadgar and with him uncovers Medivh's secret, where she is shown her own traitorous future.\n\nLothar is a general of the Stormwind army, and an armsman of the Brotherhood of the Horse. He was a childhood friend of King Llane and Medivh, and lead the war party to Karazhan to kill Medivh. He went on to lead the exodus from Stormwind after King Llane was assassinated by Garona, and the keep was destroyed by the Orcs.\n\nLlane was the last of King of Stormwind before it was rebuilt and taken by his son Varian Wrynn. He is assassinated by a reluctant Garona, who struggles under Gul'dan's manipulations.\n\nThe main human kingdom of the early era of Warcraft was Stormwind, it was the only human kingdom explored in Warcraft I, and its lands are the main focus of this story. It is ruled by King Llane Wrynn, and its military led by his childhood friend, Anduin Lothar. The two spent much of their childhood with Medivh Aran, who was the most powerful of the trio, and a potent magician. As he aged, Medivh fell into a coma for the majority of his youth, and when he awoke, left the protected regions of the kingdom for the abandoned tower, Karazhan.\n\nThe book begins with an apprentice mage, Khadgar, arriving at Karazhan. He had been dispatched from the mage-ruled city of Dalaran to become the magus's personal apprentice, and to discover more about the mysterious mage. During the first month following his arrival, Medivh explains to him that the fabric of reality in Karazhan is weak, and that “While with a clock, each tick comes in succession of another, Karazhan is like an hourglass, where all the grains of sand fall into the bottom, but not always in the same order,” and as such, there are visions from the future and the past.\n\nKhadgar works hard to earn the status of apprentice, mostly by organizing Medivh's chaotic library. This was a feat none of the other aspirants achieved; most left after being unsettled by the tower's prophetic visions or Medivh's erratic behaviour. During this time, Medivh makes several long trips outside the tower.\n\nUpon earning the right to being Medivh's apprentice, the two mount atop a gryphon and fly to a swampy region of the kingdom, the Black Morass. While in the Black Morass, there are several war parties of green-skinned savages known as Orcs, one of which shoots Khadgar down. Khadgar dispatches of a few grunts, but eventually his magical ability is exhausted, just as he is cornered by an Orc warlock. Fortunately, Medivh swoops in to slay the remainder of the party. The two then make their way back from the heavier concentrations and rendezvous with Anduin Lothar and his troops.\n\nThe next few months involve Khadgar doing work about the castle while receiving some training from Medivh. Ultimately, Medivh takes an extended leave from Karazhan in which he lets Khadgar freely study. Khadgar spend most of this time trying to control and command the visions of Karazhan, and invokes one of Medivh's mother, Aegwynn, battling a horde of demons, and Sargeras, a fallen Titan, (creators of Azeroth, Draenor, and the rest of the universe), also known as the Destroyer of Worlds.\n\nUpon Medivh's arrival, he is immediately summoned to Stormwind, where he brings along Khadgar. When they enter the great city, they are greeted by Lothar who reveals that two of the court conjurers summoned a demon, which killed them both. Medivh asks Lothar to leave the room while he speaks with Khadgar privately, where he explains the history of the magic, and many events thousands of years in the world's past. He comes to explain, that after a catastrophe that nearly destroyed the world, there was a council of powerful magi who elected to grant their powers to a single entity responsible for guarding the world against demonic threats. After they had aged considerably, the Council of Tirisfal would retake the power and search for a new Guardian. After thousands of years, and dozens of Guardians, Medivh's mother, Aegwynn was chosen as a Guardian. She saw how politically involved many of the council members had become, and decided it was time to take away their power to choose the next Guardian. She took it upon herself to use magic to extend her lifespan, and through fighting more demons than any others, discovered that there was a large force in the icy continent of Northrend, hunting the green dragons. She sought to end their hunt, and freed the dragons, destroying them, and Sargeras (the vision Khadgar had). After many battles with the Burning Legion, she fathered herself a child from the Stormwind court conjurer, and member of the Council of Tirisfal, Nielas Aran, and bore Medivh.\n\nAfter hunting down the demon loose in the city of Stormwind, Medivh returned to Karazhan with Khadgar, where he fell into a second (but much shorter) coma, this one lasting only a few weeks. During this time, Khadgar once saw to the Magus's quarters to see how he fared, and during this time, he saw the image of Sargeras watching over Medivh as well.\n\nShortly after he awoke, an emissary arrived at the tower and spent much time with Medivh, which made Khadgar slightly jealous. One day he decided to attempt his vision summoning spell, and he spotted the emissary observing him. He raced after the emissary, angered that it was spying on him, and chased it down the tower, where he pulled off its hood to reveal it was a female Orc. After a short brawl, the orc the winner, Khadgar retreated to the Magus's observatory where they spoke about the Orc, who was, in truth, a half-orc.\n\nKhadgar and the half-orc, Garona, spent many hours studying together in the library, she trying to learn more about the human kingdoms, claiming they were for peace talks, and Khadgar so he could better understand the orcs. Garona claimed that, being half-orc, all the Orcs saw her whiter skin, shorter tusks, and softer complex. All the humans, like Khadgar, saw her green skin, her tusks, and her savagery, and that none would take have her be a part of their society.\n\nKhadgar and Garona eventually happened upon a conversation about the Orcs' entry into Azeroth; the Dark Portal. Eventually Garona coaxed Khadgar into using his vision spell to show them both how it was opened. It revealed the Orc Arch-warlock Gul'dan, awaking from a dream to a vision of a hooded figure who promised the Orcs a new world to conquer, his last comment being, “Do not worry, I have everything under control, for I am the Guardian,” with a toss back of his hood, revealing it was Medivh.\n\nShortly following this vision, Medivh arrived in the library and confronted them, a ward that would protect from demons, holding him off. During this time, Khadgar was able to conjure another vision, this one of Aegwynn confronting Medivh on his catastrophic actions. During this vision, Medivh breaks down and begins to cry out towards the vision, and Garona and Khadgar escape to Stormwind on a gryphon. They are forced off their gryphon when Medivh called it back to Karazhan, and hiked the rest of the way to Stormwind after a confrontation with both an orcish raiding party, and a human regiment. Once in Stormwind, Khadgar speaks with Lothar and Llane about the Magus's betrayal, and that there is more inhabitting his body than Medivh and the Guardian's powers. They go on to Karazhan together, to do battle with the Magus. Afterwards it is revealed that Medivh was being possessed by Sargeras.\n"}
{"id": "2033171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033171", "title": "Smart Parts", "text": "Smart Parts\n\nSmart Parts was a paintball manufacturing company in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, which filed for liquidation on July 28, 2010.\nAs of August 22, 2010 Smart Parts Assets and IP was Acquired by Kee Action Sports.\n\nSmart Parts was a producer of paintball markers and accessories. Their first product was the Smart Parts aluminium one piece barrel made for the Tippmann 68 Special and the PMI-3 semi automatic markers. This barrel had a standard bore with a spiral drilled venting system in the end of the barrel. The design supposedly improved accuracy by decreasing turbulence as the paintball exited the barrel, and also decreased noise produced by the gun upon firing. The later All-American Barrel was a two-piece barrel system using spiral porting and a front bore diameter of 68 caliber. In the early to mid 1990s SP's products ranged from barrels and clothing to a few generic accessories along with some marker specific ones (such as parts for the AirGun Designs Automag series).\n\nSmart Parts produced \"The Freak\" paintball marker barrel system that can accommodate almost any size bore diameter paintball. The Freak kit comes standard with eight different sized barrel inserts including: .679.682.684.687.689.691.693.695. Along with the eight inserts includes the Freak kit case as well as the Freak back piece. The front barrel piece is sold separately in different lengths in order to accommodate all barrel lengths.\n\nIn 1990, Smart Parts produced their first in-house marker. Called the Boss, the Smart Parts pump marker featured a spiral ported barrel and a 'shoebox' style body (which would be mirrored in their first electronic gun design); The Boss was targeted at high-end woodsball tournament players but was not well-received, being considered to be too heavy and too large (when compared to offerings such as the Carter Comp or LAPCO Grey Ghost). The Boss was withdrawn from the market and Smart Parts concentrated on producing customized versions of other manufacturer's markers until 1996 when Smart Parts began selling their first electronic marker, the Shocker. This marker was manufactured by a company called pneuVentures, but sold exclusively through Smart Parts. This original Shocker was a dual-solenoid, closed bolt, hammerless marker that was large, heavy, inefficient, and could fire a maximum speed of 9 shots per second. A couple thousand of these were sold over the course of its lifetime. Other companies that had been working on their own electronic markers also released them about the same time (WDP Angel - 1996, Brass Eagle Rainmaker - 1997).\n\nThe pneuVentures Shocker was sold until 1997 when Smart Parts redesigned it and started producing it themselves. This redesigned marker, which became known as the Shocker Sport, was released in 1998. It included a number of major revisions to the original design, including a more lightweight profile, improved electronics and grounding, a faster cycling set of internals, and better solenoids. The Shocker Sport was sold from 1998 to 2002, and the design of its external look changed a few times during that period. A few companies even released their own customized versions, mainly the Planet Eclipse Shocker (which was manufactured by Smart Parts for the company Planet Eclipse, which at the time didn't make any markers of their own). Another customized Shocker was the SL Shocker from HyperSportWorks.\n\nShocker Sports were the first factory marker to feature an enhanced firing mode, which later became known as \"ramping\". This firing mode was called Turbo mode by Smart Parts, and involved a firing program whereby the user would pull the trigger around 5 times per second, and the marker's actual firing speed would increase to over 9 shots per second. This type of firing mode was largely unheard-of in the industry at the time, so people were conflicted about its use. Turbo mode became illegal to use in tournaments and on some open-play recreational games due to the obvious advantage it gave the user.\nAfter the turn of the century, ramping modes have become more and more popular, and many markers come with them as stock from the factory. As a result, the use of ramping modes has become more mainstream, and is allowed in some recreational games and some tournaments. However, this varies from game to game and tournament circuit to circuit, so it is still disallowed by many fields.\n\nThe Impulse was released in the year 2000 and was the sister design to SP's other marker available at the time, the Shocker Sport. Over the course of its lifetime the Impulse became one of the most popular markers available, and was notable for following many trends for parts, style, and features in the paintball industry on the turn of the century.\n\nImpulses had a similar appearance to the Shocker Sport, however they were internally quite different; Impulses were based on the common \"stacked-tube\" hammer/valve layout (two bore design, bolt on top with the hammer on bottom). In contrast to the Shocker Sport, Impulses were capable of faster fire rates, were more lightweight, were cheaper, and also experienced greater tank efficiency. As a result, the gaining popularity of this product over the Shocker was foreseeable. Impulses were one of many stacked-tube electronic markers developed around the same time by opposing companies. Markers such as this were considered to be the top-end by many players (typically those involved with tournaments), and as a result the cost for upgraded versions was quite high ($1000+).\n\nIn 2001, Smart Parts released a variety of upgrades and enhancements to the Impulse line, including the Vision eye system, upgraded bolts, improved valves and internals, and other smaller upgrade components. The Vision electronic eye system was particularly popular since few other markers were available with such a part from the factory (this has since changed, and the feature is a near-requirement from manufacturers). In 2002, the electronics were redesigned to the \"Cricket\" version, which involved a more reliable circuit board that also used more developed programming.\n\nThe other growing trend that Impulses followed were the addition of stylish milling patterns and designs, suited for different retailers and sponsored teams. This has become a popular trend for the more expensive markers of today. There were over 30 customized body styles and parts available known as \"Private Labels\" before the marker was discontinued. Contingent to this was the growing number of parts and accessories available for the Impulse line as well, from various manufacturers and developers, which allowed nearly every part of the marker to be swapped for an \"aftermarket\" version. The serial number of the marker is located on the right-hand side towards the back.\n\nList of Private Label Impulses:\n\n\nIn 2009 Smart Parts released another Impulse, a high-end marker that used the ram driven operation of the Ego and Intimidator. It incorporated several features used by Smart Parts' highest-end marker, the DLX Luxe, such as an internal gas system.\n\nThe year 2003 brought several new markers and products from Smart Parts, due to a reshuffling of design engineers. The most notable new product from this time period was the Shocker 03 marker (whose name soon after became Shocker SFT). The Shocker SFT was a redesigned marker that used a single solenoid open bolt, cock valve operation capable of high firing speeds,small body size, but an average efficiency without a Smart Parts High Efficiency Bolt. Although this marker was given the name \"Shocker\", it actually shares virtually no design aspects with its namesake the older Shocker Sport. However, Smart Parts decided to call it the next-generation \"Shocker\" for marketing purposes, since the older Shockers were already discontinued.\n\nEver since having been released in July 2003, the Shocker SFT has remained the premier Smart Parts marker, representing top of the line performance and reliability. Shockers have been chosen by the majority of Smart Parts' sponsored teams since their release. The Shocker's popularity also brought along many upgrades and customized versions, available from various manufacturers and developers, similar to its older brother the Impulse. Base-model Shockers currently retail around $700, with the more customized \"private label\" version around $1000 or more (depending on the model).\n\nIn late 2006 (sometimes described as 2007 for simplicity) the Shocker SFT was redesigned into the newer \"Shocker NXT\" version, which is the same internal marker as the SFT, except it uses upgraded parts from the factory, and has a few enhancements to the frame, in-line regulator, and other parts of the marker to increase performance and reliability. The cosmetics were also changed to reflect the new internals. Some Shocker SFT parts are no longer compatible with the newer Shocker NXT model. This includes barrel threads, as the NXT uses the same threads as the Ion and Impulse. There are several other parts that may not be compatible, including the trigger, and vertical ASA.\n\nPrivate Label Shockers Include:(SFT)\n\nThe other new-to-2003 Smart Parts marker was called the Nerve. It has since been discontinued. Nerves are a next-generation Impulse design, featuring a smaller and lighter profile, improved internals, upgraded and streamlined components from the factory, and a sleeker external look. It shares many parts that are interchangeable with the shocker, however it uses a different platform for operation. When Nerves were first released (several months late due to manufacturing and development issues), it was designed to be Smart Parts flagship \"no upgrades needed\" marker. It came packed with Smart Parts best accessories. The high-end features resulted in the MSRP costing $1200 for the base model, or $1500 for the upgraded package with HPA tank included. The reasoning for this was based on the previous customized Impulse markers, which retailed for $1000+, however the Nerve's high price tag didn't fare as well with the public. This was partially because public trends were already shifting away from the stacked-tube hammer/valve markers which the Nerve was based from, and toward more advanced designs such as the Shocker, Dye Matrix line, and others (this trend proceeded through 2004). To combat this, Nerve price was dropped a few months later to $1000, then again to $850. At this point Nerves were finally gaining popularity as originally expected, however one final blow was dealt to the Nerve which would put it away - the release of the Ion (below). In late 2005 SP produced an additional large batch of Nerve parts, however after this the line was halted and the marker was unofficially discontinued in light of other products.\n\nIn March 2005, Smart Parts released their most popular marker, the Ion. The development, production, and eventual release of this product were completely unanticipated due to being conducted in relative secrecy by Smart Parts. As a result, when the Ion became available it was an immediate hit in both sales, demand, and expectations.\n\nThe Ion was the trend starter for a new marketing idea in the paintball industry, whereby relatively high-performance parts would be sold after the absolute lowest price markup, thus allowing the product (Ion) to be sold for an extremely reasonable price. The Ion uses similar principals in design to the higher-performance Shocker marker, however several key factors to the Ion design were altered to allow it a drastic reduction in production cost (allowing the low MSRP price tag for the end-user). In particular, the Ion was cheaper to produce due to its modular body/exoskeleton design, newly designed inexpensive solenoid, and use of internal air tubing instead of machined manifold ports like high-end markers. These, combined with a reasonably low markup in price for retailers, allowed the Ion to debut with an MSRP of $275. The MSRP was later reduced to $200 for about a year-long period, but was increased back up to $225 at a later time. It was again reduced back down to $200.\n\nThe Ion has quickly become one of the most, if not the most popular markers ever available. This is justified by it selling over 100,000 units in a one-year period, a feat which few if any paintball markers has ever done to date; some markers that have been available for over a decade haven't been able to match these numbers. The release of this marker dealt a noticeable blow to nearly every competing product across the globe, and was so strong that it even affected the resale and demand of used products as well. The release of the Ion had more than doubled the size of Smart Parts itself, in both manufacturing space and workforce. A few years after having been released, the wake of the Ion's blow to the paintball industry actually hit Smart Parts themselves, which contributed to the temporary increase in MSRP. This particular year in the paintball industry (2005) saw the most closed stores, fields, and manufacturers than all previous years combined. The release of the Ion being coincidentally in 2005 surely couldn't have helped, however factual evidence either way is circumstantial.\n\nOther paintball companies have matched this low-cost, low markup marketing concept (examples being the Proto Rail (based on the Proto Matrix), ICD Promaster, Eclipse Etek Ego (based on the Planet Eclipse Ego), and others). However, these competing products are notably less popular in comparison, likely due to their higher price tags, although still remaining very economic alternatives to their respective \"high-performance\" counterparts. The popularity of the Ion also allots it a massive amount of upgrades and specialized products, and like the older Impulse literally every part of the marker can be replaced with an aftermarket version.\n\nIn 2007 Smart Parts released an updated version of the ion called the ION XE, that includes built in B.O.B (bolt out back) function, which allows easier removal of the bolt. This makes maintenance considerably easier, as one must only take out a single screw as opposed to taking apart the entire marker. This was one of the major criticisms of the original Ions. The new Ion XE also consists of a new and improved low profile feedneck and a new body design. Ion XE colored bodies are available.\n\nThe SP-8 was released after the Ion. Mechanically, the two markers are almost identical, the major differences being that the SP-8 has a 45 degree feed tube instead of a vertical one, the regulator is mounted 15 degrees forward instead of vertical, the pressure gauge is on the right side instead of the left, and the triggers are different. The most noticeable difference is that the SP-8 has a milsim body, designed to mimic the appearance of a Heckler & Koch XM8 assault rifle, and is designed to easily allow the addition of a stock, as well as military accessories such as bipods, tactical flashlights, or red dot sights using weaver rails. This product was designed to bring the performance of an electronic marker to scenario players who sought paintball marker with a more realistic look and feel.\n\nThe SP1 is a woodsball/scenario marker, being released in the same lineup as the Vibe, EOS, and Ion XE. It is the Vibe's woodsball counterpart (it has 7 mounting rails on its body for flashlights, laser sights and scopes), in the same way that the SP8 is the Ion's counterpart. It is also limited to 11 BPS. It uses the same internals as the Vibe, but has two different shells to protect them (an internal shell and an external \"cosmetic\" shell). Smart Parts claims that this marker has many possible upgrades, although most of these are limited to the guns mounting rails thus far. As with the Vibe, players whom own this marker are finding ways to shut off the Maximum Rate Of Fire limiter. With Smart Parts releasing the Blackheart in Q1 2008, the rate of fire is raised to 20 BPS. Along with that it adds anti-chop eyes.\n\nThe epiphany marker represents an upgraded version of the Ion. The Epiphany is a more stylized, upgraded Ion which comes with several factory enhancements out of the box, saving the user from buying the more inexpensive Ion and having to buy separate upgraded components for it over time. Besides for the obvious cosmetic difference, Epiphanies feature a metal exoskeleton and frame (with plating, to avoid threading problems), upgraded Firebolt, Freak barrel starter, integrated ASA dovetail, Q-Lock Feed Neck (Eos only), and Smartvalve ASA among other things. Internally the Epiphany also gives the user the ability to alter the marker's internal firing air volume. This is carried out by select from three different internal air volume \"inserts\" which are used to take up slack space in the marker's fire chamber. The smaller air space in the fire chamber can refill faster, which allows the Epiphany to fire faster without velocity drop-off when compared to the Ion and SP-8. The fire chamber inserts allow fine-tuning and adjustment that wouldn't be previously available without developing a homemade modification. The Epiphany fire chamber, inserts and valve spring are available as performance upgrades for the Ion and SP-8. Epiphanies are available in multiple colors and cost around $300.\n\nVibe is the latest marker in Smart Part's low cost lineup, as it was released at the same time as the SP1, the EOS, and the Ion XE. It is an electropneumatic marker operating at approximately 180 PSI, similar to that of the Ion. It is also extremely inexpensive for an electropneumatic marker - it can be bought for $140. It doesn't include eyes, instead it has a low force bolt. With the low force bolt - chopping is nearly eliminated. The newer Vibe has 4 firing modes; tournament lock semi auto, semi auto, 3 shot burst, and fully automatic. The first batch of Vibes didn't include these modes and because of the upgrade so close after the release - Smart Parts will upgrade your non select fire board free of charge.\n\nThe marker weight is only 1 lb. 11 oz. The length (w/out barrel) is 8.75 in. The vibe is made of Glass fiber reinforced nylon grip (frame/body) and accepts Impulse threaded barrels.\n\nSmart Parts has sold their two-piece All American barrel system since 1989. This was changed in 2001 to the current version which uses a standardized thread compatible with Freak barrel backs (below). The cosmetic milling was changed on the AA barrel in 2006 (along with most other barrels from SP).\n\nSP has sold or is currently selling several one-piece barrels, including the Progressive (stock on Impulses), Teardrop (Progressive barrel with upgraded porting), Linear barrel, and the Tactical 21\" barrel (used mainly on SP8 markers).\n\nSmart Parts' major barrel product is the Freak barrel system. This is an \"insert\" barrel kit, where the user selects one of a number of different-sized bore inserts to use (eight different sizes and a barrel back and barrel tip come with the full Freak kit). There is a total of 9 inserts in normal sizes and a 10th one (reball sized). The boremaster sets are: the aluminum boremaster set is .679.682.684.687.689.691.693,and .695 and the stainless boremaster set is .682.684.687.689.691.693.695,and .697. The insert is then installed in the back of the barrel (a two-piece barrel plus the insert, making three pieces total). The alternative to this is a \"multi-bore\" kit that consists of varied barrel backs for a two-piece barrel. The advantages to using an insert instead of a multi-back kit is greatly reduced price and versatility of use on more than one type of marker. The disadvantage is that inserts are more fragile (aluminium more so than the stainless) than a typical barrel back, so care must be taken.\nFreak barrels are available in aluminium and steel versions, compatible with both Freak and All American style fronts (varying color, length. Freak barrel backs and All American backs are compatible with the \"Stiff tip\" (carbon fiber tip made by STIFFI/Site Mfg.). The insert sets are compatible with white wolf airsmithing's \"justice barrels\" aka phantoms \"Frantom\", and Deadly Winds \"Fiber barrel\" . Freak styling was changed in 2006 along with the other SP barrels.\n\nIn addition to equipment, Smart Parts manufactured different types of apparel, such as jerseys, pants, pod packs, barrel socks/plugs, and casual wear. Smart Parts developed customized jerseys for their sponsored teams and could also be contracted to making a team number of jerseys for private use.\n\nSmart Parts has continuously strived to market non-screw in type tank systems for use with their markers. These types of air systems are mounted directly to the marker and don't use a standard \"screw-in\" type ASA adapter. The first version of this air system was the Max-Flo manifold in 1999, which continued until mid/late 2003. This regulator system used a large regulator and attached manifold section to operate. This was redesigned into the Max-Flo Inline in 2003, which continued until early 2006. The Max-Flo Inline was similar to the previous versions except drastically reduced in size and appearance. In 2006 SP released the Max-Flo Micro, which was their first non-adjustable tank system. The Micro version is the smallest air system to date from SP.\n\nSmart Parts also produced an in-line ASA on/off valve (called the Smartvalve) which gives standard screw-in tanks the ability to use an on/off shutoff valve. The Smartvalve system does not include a bleed feature. The Smartvalve was also available in a CO tank version, giving the CO tank integrated shutoff capability as well.\n\n"}

The formats are varied according to use, with the largest differences being whether or not the disc is written to. Within each use category, there are often competing formats or implementations.\n\n\n\n\nDVD drives from 2004 onward should be able to read either of the competing recordable formats; older drives may read DVD+R discs better. , DVD drives typically allow writing to both DVD-R[W] and DVD+R[W] discs, making the difference largely irrelevant to the average consumer.\n\nVR Mode, also known as Video Recording mode, is a new format that allows editing and deleting of titles and has defect management. This mode is used by the DVD-RAM and DVD-RW formats. Because it is newer than DVD Video mode, it can only be played back in more recent DVD players that support it.\n\nVideo mode is the standard DVD video mode format used by DVD movies. Because the DVD Video format was invented before DVDs were recordable it doesn't allow editing of the disc, doesn't support defect management and is therefore not as robust. Space from deleted titles may not be fully reclaimed until the disc is completely erased. It is compatible with most DVD players. It is used on DVD-RW and DVD-R discs, but has never used for DVD-RAM. Most (but not all) recorders that use DVD-RW will offer the choice of VR mode or Video mode.\n\n+VR was introduced by Philips for use on DVD+RW. The idea was to maintain compatibility with the DVD Video format so it could be played elsewhere, but try and introduce some features as found in the VR mode used on DVD-RW/DVD-RAM. DVD+RW normally uses this mode in set-top recorders. It doesn't need a separate finalise step to play in other DVD recorders; finalisation is just done in the background, which makes it bit easier to use (i.e. you can't forget to do it), but it does put extra wear on the disc, as the same area of the disc is updated every time it is used. Due to DVD-Video not being able to take advantage of defect management and the extra overhead of background finalising after each edit or recording, the +VR mode has always been the least reliable, and the editing features may be missing on some DVD recorders to make it more robust.\n\nBecause Video Mode and VR mode are Forum standards, they are only used when recording to DVD approved formats i.e. DVD-RAM/DVD-RW/DVD-R discs. DVD+RW isn't approved by the DVD Forum and manufacturers can't get a license for it to use the above modes, leading Philips to introducing their own +VR mode for use with DVD+RW.\n"}

He was taught piano technique by Julius Epstein. From 1908 to 1914 he was deputy to E. T. Cook as organist of Southwark Cathedral. In 1909 he graduated as Bachelor of Music at the University of London. In the same year he became organist and choirmaster of Holy Trinity, Paddington, a post that he held until 1948. He was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Organists.\n\nIn 1914 Chuckerbutty had his first song, \"An Old Song\", published by Boosey. Immediately after the First World War he started a dance band and ran it for several months, after which he began a career as a cinema organist, running in tandem with his church work. He joined the musical staff of the Angel, Islington in 1920, and played there until 1927, after which he held other similar posts at, among other venues, the Café Royal, Regent Street; Shoreditch Olympia; the Ritz, Edgware; the Carlton, Essex Road; the New Gallery and the Forum, Kentish Town.

Lum York remembers \"I only had two pairs of overalls. My mother washed on Wednesdays so I had to wear them all week long.\"\n\nLum was born on November 16, 1918 as William Herbert York in the tiny hamlet of Elmore, just about 15 miles north of Montgomery, Alabama. Farming is a hard life at best. This was one of the worst times. Poverty gripped the rural south with an iron fist. To eke out a meager living, crops demanded grueling service. Lum was a schoolboy before they moved to a house with electricity. But life was more than just the backbreaking work of picking cotton and tilling the vegetable patch. On Saturday nights when the family gathered around the radio the Grand Ole Opry, Lum’s lifelong love of music was born. When he was 12, his older brother bought a guitar. Within a year, Lum had taught himself to play by listening to the radio. When his brother joined the army, Lum bought his guitar for fifty cents.\n\nNot far away in Georgiana, Alabama, another child was born in 1923 whose life was destined to link with Lum’s in the creation of the most enduring legend country music has ever known. Hank Williams had won a talent contest at the Montgomery Empire Theater singing an original song entitled \"WPA Blues\" in December 1937. There was no stopping his music career from that moment. He worked local clubs and did a show on WSFA, a Montgomery radio station.\n\nLum had to drop out of school to help his mother after his father died. He worked with the CCC, Roosevelt’s Civilian Conservation Program to help stimulate the economy by allowing boys and young men to work on public buildings and parks for a small salary plus room and board. When Lum returned from the CCC camp, he would hitchhike into town to hear the local bands play. Since he had no money to buy a ticket, he filched eggs from his mother’s chicken house and sold them to local groceries for the admission price. He had heard Hank on the radio and began to hang around the station. They first met in 1939. The friendship remained throughout Hank’s life. The two men worked together as musicians and at various shipyards when the money from the beloved music wasn’t enough to make ends meet.\n\nIn 1944 Lum and his big bass fiddle joined Hank’s band, The Drifting Cowboys. Lum told of the first time he played music with Hank, \"We had got to be friends working together in the shipyard. One night I went where he was playing. I had bought a bass and was learning to play it. I was also friends with the guy who was playing bass that night and he asked me to sit in while he went to the bathroom. Hank and Audrey were dancing while I played the set. When the music ended, Hank asked me ‘You want a job playing with the band?’ I told him, ‘Hank, I don’t know how to play too good.’ He said, ‘You want to learn? I’ll pay you $20 a week and room and board.’\"\n\nUntil 1948, Lum drove around the South with Hank and the band. Sometimes there was only one other member, the trumpet player. Occasionally Hank’s family joined them. Lycrecia, Hank’s stepdaughter, who was about five or six then, recalled those times in a letter to Lum.\" You were like a big brother to me. You were the one that played games with me, taught me to tell time when I was traveling from one town to another. You made me laugh; you were my best friend. When I think back about how I used to sit on your lap when we were traveling to the shows because there wasn’t anywhere for me to sit with the big bass fiddle running down the middle of the car, I have to laugh. We were so crowded in that car! Then when it would get late and I got sleepy, Mom would put me in your fiddle case backstage.\"\n\nAs Hank’s popularity and his income increased, he acquired a tiny trailer to pull around to shows. Audrey sometimes joined them then and they were treated to \"home cooked\" meals. It also gave them a place to lie down and rest between the shows.\n\nDuring this time, Lillie, Hank’s mother often traveled with them and managed a \"junior band\" which would play in the same area as Hank’s band. One of the members of this band, on hearing Lum’s strong southern accent, nicknamed him \"Lum\". The name was taken from a popular radio show comedy duet called \"Lum and Abner.\" The name stuck.\n\nSince Hank couldn’t smoke when he was singing he liked Lum to stand next to him to play. Lum would light up a cigarette, take a draw, and start playing, then Hank would take the cigarette and finish it. Lum commented, \"I was lighting a half a pack of cigs a night and hardly getting a smoke. I told Hank to leave my cigs alone, but as usual, he did the same thing and I kicked his hand. He went ahead and smoked it and grinned. However, I don’t recall him smoking another one of my cigs.\"\n\nBeing young, attractive and somewhat wild, Hank was a big attraction to the ladies. At one show in a small honky tonk on the edge of Montgomery, Hank and Lum were playing to just two couples. Hank spoke to the woman who worked the bar and she in turn spoke to one of the women at the table. Soon, the two men at the table went to the rest room. Lum recalls Hank telling him \"let's go\" and they hurried out to the car. The two women were lying down on the car seats. At the first red light, Lum jumped out and told Hank, \"You can get shot if you want to but I’m going home.\" He never heard any more about the incident.\n\nLum often played peacemaker in the Williams’ stormy marriage. After a squabble, Hank would have Lum go talk to Audrey. He had fond memories of visiting Audrey and playing with young Hank Williams, Jr.. The two men also collaborated on writing songs. Lum wrote the chorus and title of \"Take this Message to My Mother\" and Hank wrote the verses.\n\nLum was also the unwitting inspiration for Hank’s \"I Saw the Light\" Hank, Audrey and the band, six people altogether, were crammed into a 1942 Chevy. As you can imagine, it was hard for any of them to rest comfortably. Lum raised up to change positions. He looked out the window and as he lay back down, he stated \"We’re getting close to Montgomery. I saw the light.\" Referring to a beacon light near town that was always a landmark for the band as they returned home from shows.\n\nHank mumbled that it was a good title for a song and by the next day when the band gathered for their show on WSFA, he was picking out the tune to \"I saw the Light\". Many versions about the origin of this song have been advanced over the years but Lum felt that this is the truest.\n\nIt was around this time that Hank suggested to Lum he might be good as a comedian. Lum stated, \"That’s one big difference between country music now and then. Those days, every band carried a comedian. Today they don’t do that. But young people still like to hear jokes and stuff.\"\n\nAfter the first night, Hank told Lum he didn’t think the comedy would work but Lum decided to make it work. He put on an outrageous country bumpkin outfit, wore a wig, painted freckles on his face and used every joke he could beg borrow or steal. It was an unqualified hit, especially with the children in the audience.\n\nI asked him to tell some of his favorite jokes. He said, \"One night everyone was going to a party. Said they had a real good time drinking mixed drinks. I went home and mixed one to see how I liked it. I mixed up some Milk of Magnesia with vodka. I call it a Phillips screwdriver.\"\n\nWhen Hank went to the Louisiana Hayride in 1948, Lum was the only player from Montgomery to go with him. \"One thing about Hank, he never closed any of his shows without singing a hymn. There was always complete reverence with him and the band members at this time. Another thing, he never turned his back on the audience. He always stood facing or to the side.\"\n\nWhen Hank went to the Opry in 1949, they required him to use the house band on stage. Lum remained behind and played with the staff band on the Hayride then for Bill Monroe for a while. He began playing with Lefty Frizzell and was on the road when he learned of Hank’s death. When asked about that time Lum replied, \"I was playing with Lefty (Frizzell) then and we were playing San Antonio, Texas. We were off for a few days and I had gone to Baton Rouge, Louisiana but had to return to San Antonio the next day. Mrs. Williams called my mother trying to find me but they didn’t know where I was. She wanted me to be a pall bearer but I had to go back to work, I couldn’t let Lefty down and we had to play in Texas.\"\n\nRegarding the ‘New Country,’ Lum had this to say. \"I think if Hank was still alive today, he would be doing the same thing that he was doing back then. He loved his country music and the country style. I know he would not like this so called modern country music period.\"\n\nLum played with George Morgan, Goldie Hill, Marty Robbins and other Nashville greats for several years. He returned to Baton Rouge, Louisiana and married Juanita (Nita) Kelly in 1954. (He was married before, for a brief time in the early 50s, to Aline Coates Gibson, also of Baton Rouge.) As a married man, he needed a bit more stability than the music world offered so he went to work for the Louisiana School Board. Of course, he always played his music on the weekends.\n\nOver the years, Lum played with Tennessee Ernie Ford, Hank Thompson, Kitty Wells, Johnny and Jack, Webb Pierce, Slim Whitman, Jimmie Davis and countless other country music greats. At heart, he always remained what he was originally, a plain Southern farm boy.\n\nWhen asked about his biggest regret in life, Lum told me, \"on October 2, 1952 Hank Williams made his last appearance in Baton Rouge, Louisiana I played on the show with him and then later that night he asked me to rejoin his band and play comedian. I told him I would call him back. It was a number at a hotel. I called him back and told him I was going to stay with Lefty. I always regretted that.\" He performed almost until his death. As he could no longer play the fiddle due to a heart condition, he played the spoons.\n\nBefore his death, Lum had created two tapes, \"My Life and Times with Hank Williams\" and \"Memories are Forever.\" He retired from the school board and lived quietly with his wife until his death in 2004. His biggest pleasure in life was playing with their grandbaby, Kirby Camille Lastrapes.\n\nLum York died in Baton Rouge, Louisiana on 8-15-2004 at age 85. He was buried in the cemetery, Green Oaks Memorial Park.\n\n"}

The patterns, often depicting flowers, leaves, vines, or stems, are further delineated by simple embroidery stitches made on the surrounding material. Later broderie anglaise also featured small patterns worked in satin stitch.\n\nThe technique originated in 16th century eastern Europe—probably in what is now the Czech Republic—but remains associated with England because of its popularity there during the 19th century. In the Victorian era, broderie anglaise typically had open areas in many sizes. Transfers were used first to lay out the design on the material. In some cases, the holes were punched out with an embroidery stiletto before finishing the edge; in other cases, the fabric was embroidered first, and the hole was cut afterwards, with scissors. Beginning in the 1870s, the designs and techniques of broderie anglaise could be copied by the Swiss hand-embroidery machine.

{"id": "2033261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033261", "title": "Paul Bril", "text": "Paul Bril\n\nPaul Bril (1554 – 7 October 1626) was a Flemish painter and printmaker principally known for his landscapes. He spent most of his active career in Rome. His Italianate landscapes had a major influence on landscape painting in Italy and Northern Europe.\n\nPaul Bril is believed to have been born in Antwerp although his birthplace may have been Breda. He was the son of the painter Matthijs Bril the Elder. Paul and his older brother Matthijs likely started their artistic training with their father in Antwerp. Paul may also have been a student of the Antwerp painter Damiaen Wortelmans who was specialised in the decoration of harpsichords.\n\nMatthijs moved to Rome probably around 1575. Here he worked on several frescoes in the Vatican Palace. It is believed Paul joined his brother in Rome around or after 1582.\n\nWhen Matthijs died in 1583, his brother likely continued his work, picking up many of Matthijs' commissions. Paul's earliest known works date from the late 1580s. He established his reputation with commissions from Pope Gregory XIII in the Collegio Romano. His success was assured after Pope Sixtus V became his principal patron. Bril was part of a team specialized in landscape painting and thus participated in almost every assignment which entailed decorative landscapes, such as in the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, the Vatican Palace and the Scala Santa. Another important early commission was the fresco cycle in the Santa Cecilia in Trastevere in Rome of around 1599. \nPope Clement VIII also became his patron and gave the artist a commission for a monumental seascape on the Martyrdom of St. Clement. Paul Bril completed this commission in the Vatican Palace’s Sala Clementina in collaboration with the brothers Giovanni and Cherubino Alberti (1600–02/3). In 1601 Paul received another major commission, to paint a series of large canvases featuring properties of the Mattei family. Paul further painted landscape frescoes in the Casino dell'Aurora of the Palazzo Pallavicini-Rospigliosi in Rome.\n\nHis patrons were among the most influential people in Rome and included members from the Colonna, Borghese, Mattei and Barberini families in Rome as well as Cardinal Federico Borromeo in Milan, Cardinal Carlo de’ Medici in Florence and Duke Ferdinando Gonzaga in Mantua.\n\nIn 1621, Paul Bril became director of the Accademia di San Luca, the artists' academy in Rome. This was a clear sign of the high esteem in which he was held by his fellow artists in Rome as he was the first foreigner to hold this position.\n\nHe had many students including his son Cyriacus Bril, Luigi Carboni, Balthasar Lauwers, Willem van Nieulandt II, Pieter Spierinckx, Agostino Tassi and Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom. Karel Philips Spierincks may also briefly have been his pupil.\n\nPaul Bril died in Rome in 1626.\n\nPaul Bril initially painted in the late Mannerist style developed by his brother. These early landscapes are in the Flemish tradition inaugurated by Joachim Patinir and Pieter Bruegel the Elder and further developed by his own brother. Works from this early period were characterised by a picturesque arrangement of landscape elements and violent contrasts between light and dark. These early paintings also show strong contrasts of forms to create a sense of dramatic motion. Bril contrasted steep cliffs with chasms or dark, twisting trees growing from hills next to flat, sunlit pastures.\n\nHis style changed during his stay in Rome. His compositions became calmer and his style more classicising around 1605. This may have been due to the influence of Annibale Carracci and Adam Elsheimer. The works from this period have lower horizons and less abrupt transitions from foreground to background. The subjects are typically pastoral or bucolic scenes and mythological subjects. This late style had a strong influence on the development of Flemish landscape painting and was crucial to Claude Lorrain's formation of the classical landscape.\n\nAgostino Tassi may have been Paul's pupil. Tassi later became the master of Claude Lorrain. Paul Bril thus forms one of the links between the panoramic views of Joachim Patinir and the ideal landscape evolved by Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain. Bril is considered a precursor of the Dutch Italianates such as Cornelius van Poelenburgh and Bartholomeus Breenbergh, and, to a certain extent, of the Flemish and Dutch genre painters active in Rome known as the Bamboccianti.\n\nPaul also painted small cabinet paintings on copper and panel commencing from the 1590s. Some of these he signed with a pair of glasses, a pun on the Flemish word \"bril\" which means \"glasses\". These small-scale paintings depicted subjects that he and his brother had rendered before on a large scale, such as tempestuous seascapes, hermits in the wilderness, travelling pilgrims, peasants among ancient ruins, hunters and fishermen.\n\nA prolific draftsman, his drawings were popular with collectors and were copied by the many students who worked with him in his studio, which was a popular destination for Dutch and Flemish artists visiting Rome.\n\nHe often collaborated on paintings with Johann Rottenhammer. According to a dealer's letter of 1617, Rottenhammer painted the figures in Venice and then sent the plates to Rome for Bril to complete the landscape. Bril also collaborated with his friends Jan Brueghel the Elder and Adam Elsheimer, whom he both influenced and was influenced by. His collaboration with Elsheimer is shown in a painting now in Chatsworth House. Bril introduced Jan Brueghel the Elder to Cardinal Federico Borromeo, who subsequently became Brueghel's most important patron. He also let the Dutch landscape artist Bartholomeus Breenbergh live in his Roman residence for many years.\n\n"}

{"id": "2033280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033280", "title": "Contrabass flute", "text": "Contrabass flute\n\nThe contrabass flute is one of the rarer members of the flute family. It is seen often in flute ensembles, however it is recently being used in solo and chamber music situations. Its range is similar to that of the regular concert flute, except that it is pitched two octaves lower; the lowest performable note is two octaves below middle C (the lowest C on the cello). Many contrabass flutes in C are also equipped with a low B, (in the same manner as many modern standard sized flutes are.) Contrabass flutes are only available from select flute makers.\n\nSometimes referred to as the \"gentle giant\" of the flute family, the contrabass retains the facility for trills, as found elsewhere in the flute world. Ease of arpeggiation is moderate and thus equivalent to the rest of the flute family. The upper registers (middle C and above) lack the strength of tone found in its cousins; the strongest register is arguably that between G and G. Though the upper register can lack strength, its sensitivity and lyricism can be used to great effect; and a good instrument can readily reach the high A or B (above middle C). The 'haunting' low register (below G) has similar qualities to the bassoon, and the low B (three octaves below middle C) can carry well with an experienced performer.\n\nThe contrabass flute requires much greater volume of air to produce sound than most other wind instruments, and composers who write for this instrument might consider more frequent breaks in phrasing than one would when writing for smaller flutes. The contribution that the addition of the contrabass flute has made to the composition of flute choirs is enormous, offering at last the grounding of a true and deep bass sound. A wider, slower air stream is needed to produce a solid tone. \n\nContemporary musicians using the contrabass flute include Paige Dashner Long, Andy Findon, Laura Hyder, Madeleine Bischof, Pierre-Yves Artaud, Matthias Ziegler, Stefan Keller, Ned McGowan, Peter Sheridan, Sérgio Morais, David Lamont and Vinny Golia, who also plays all the other sizes of flute, and has recorded with it on the CD \"Music for Like Instruments: The Flutes\", in a quartet with three other flutists. Due to the price and rarity of this instrument, few people have explored this instrument.\n\nThe contrabass flute in C is produced by the Japanese firm of Kotato & Fukushima, Eva Kingma, Pearl, and Christian Jäger from Munich. Jupiter flutes has created a student model for flute ensembles.\n\nContrabass flutes have also been made from PVC pipe, by the Dutch flute maker Jelle Hogenhuis. It is reported that while it might be thought that an instrument made from PVC would be inferior, the PVC allows for a louder instrument if the wall thickness is kept small. PVC also permits more rough treatment, as the plastic instrument can be bumped without denting.\n\nNew solo and chamber music is being composed almost every day for this instrument, and performer Peter Sheridan has commissioned numerous works from composers around the world, including: Alex Shapiro, Patrick Neher, Vinny Golia, Bruce Lawrence, Adrienne Albert, and Sheridon Stokes. As a virtuoso solo instrument, even a few concertos have been composed for the contrabass flute. Catherine McMichael composed a concerto for low flutes and orchestra in 2006 entitled 'Three Philosophies', in which one of the movements features the contrabass flute. In April 2008 the well structured concerto \"Bantammer's Swing\" for contrabass flute and chamber orchestra by Ned McGowan was premiered in Carnegie Hall. In 2010, the 'Lyric Concerto' for contrabass flute and strings was commissioned by Sheridan from the late Australian composer Bruce Lawrence. 'Nola' by composer Benjamin Yusapov, was commissioned by the International soloist Matthias Ziegler, for multiple Low Flutes and orchestra. Numerous composers have written for the contrabass flute, including Wil Offermans, Robert Dick, Thomas Seelig, Andrew Downes, Catherine McMichael, and Günter Steinke, to name only a few.\n\nFurthermore, the contrabass flute is being utilized more in the flute choir with most newer pieces including a part for the instrument. Though for many pieces, the part is either a duplicate or simplification of the bass flute part, some of the newest repertoire includes an independent contrabass flute part. Composers of such pieces include Peter Senchuk, Toby Caplan-Stonefield, Lawrence Ink, Phyllis Avidan Louke, and Judy Nishimura, among others.\n\nOne is a \"contrabass flute in G,\" pitched a fourth below the bass flute and an octave lower than the alto flute; thus, this is technically a contra-alto flute. Another instrument is the subcontrabass flute in G, pitched one octave below the contra-alto flute, or two octaves below the alto flute in G. Kotato & Fukushima also produce a \"subcontrabass flute in C\", or double contrabass flute, pitched a full octave below the contrabass flute.\n\nwww.contraflute.com\n"}

His childhood appellation was \"Teru-no-miya\" (Prince Teru). Like his elder brothers, Prince Hirohito and Prince Yasuhito, he attended the boy's elementary and secondary departments of the Peers' School (Gakushuin). When Prince Arisugawa Takehito (1862–1913), the tenth head of the collateral imperial house of Arisugawa-no-miya, died without a male heir, Emperor Taishō placed Prince Nobuhito in the house. The name of the house reverted to the original Takamatsu-no-miya. The new Prince Takamatsu was a fourth cousin, four times removed of Prince Takehito.\n\nPrince Takamatsu attended the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy from 1922 to 1925. He received a commission as an ensign on 1 December 1925 and took up duties aboard the battleship \"Fusō\".

Prince Takamatsu graduated from the Naval Staff College in 1936, after having been promoted to lieutenant commander on 15 November 1935. He was promoted to the rank of commander on 15 November 1940 and finally to captain on 1 November 1942. From 1936 to 1945, he held various staff positions in the Naval General Staff Office in Tokyo.\n\nOn 4 February 1930, Prince Takamatsu married Kikuko Tokugawa (26 December 1911 – 18 December 2004), the second daughter of Yoshihisa Tokugawa (peer). The bride was a granddaughter of Yoshinobu Tokugawa, the last Shōgun of the Tokugawa shogunate, and a granddaughter of the late Prince Arisugawa Takehito. Shortly after the wedding, Prince and Princess Takamatsu embarked upon a world tour to Europe and then across the United States so as to strengthen the goodwill and understanding between Japan and those nations. The 1930-1931 photo to the right presents Princess and Prince Takamatsu during their honorary reception given by U.S. President Herbert Hoover who escorted them down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. as thousands of excited spectators looked on. The photo.comes from the illustrated biography on Prince Tokugawa Iesato titled The Art of Peace. Prince Tokugawa Iesato (also known as Prince Iyesato Tokugawa) was the uncle of Prince and Princess Takamatsu. Prince Tokugawa allied with Prince and Princess Takamatsu on many international goodwill projects. \n\nPrince and Princess Takamatsu had no children.\n\nFrom the 1930s, Prince Takamatsu expressed grave reservations regarding Japanese aggression in Manchuria and the decision to wage war on the United States.\n\nIn 1991, his wife Kikuko, Princess Takamatsu and an aide discovered a twenty-volume diary, written in Prince Takamatsu's own hand between 1934 and 1947. Despite opposition from the entrenched bureaucrats of the Imperial Household Agency, she gave the diary to the magazine \"Chūōkōron\" which published excerpts in 1995.\n\nThe diary revealed that Prince Takamatsu bitterly opposed the Kwantung Army's incursions in Manchuria in September 1931, the expansion of the July 1937 Marco Polo Bridge Incident into a full-scale war of aggression against China and in November 1941 warned his brother, Hirohito that the Imperial Japanese Navy could not sustain hostilities for longer than two years against the United States. He urged Emperor Shōwa to seek peace after the Japanese naval defeat at the Battle of Midway in 1942; an intervention which apparently caused a severe rift between the brothers.\n\nAfter the Battle of Saipan in July 1944, Prince Takamatsu joined his mother Empress Teimei, his uncles Prince Higashikuni, Prince Asaka, former prime minister Konoe Fumimaro, and other aristocrats, in seeking the ouster of the prime minister, Tojo Hideki.\n\nAfter the end of WWII, Prince Takamatsu became the honorary president of various charitable, cultural and athletic organizations including the Japan Fine Arts Society, the Denmark-Japan Society, the France-Japan Society, the Tofu Society for the Welfare of Leprosy Patients, the Sericulture Association, the Japan Basketball Association, and the Saise Welfare Society. He also served as a patron of the Japanese Red Cross Society (present day the Honorary President is Empress Michiko) and was a major contributor of the NBTHK (Nihon Bijutsu Token Hozon Kyokai or Society for the Preservation of the Japanese Sword). He also officiated the Honorary President of the Preparatory Committee for founding International Christian University (ICU) located in Mitaka, Tokyo.\n\nIn 1975, the \"Bungei Shunjū\" literary magazine published a long interview with Takamatsu in which he told of the warning he made to his brother Hirohito on November 30, 1941, the warning he made to him after Midway and that, before the surrender, he and Prince Konoe had considered asking for the emperor's abdication. The interview implied that the emperor had been a firm supporter of the Greater East Asia War (Japanese name of the Pacific War in those days) while the prince was not.\n\nIn 1991, Princess Takamatsu and an aide discovered a twenty-volume diary, written in Prince Takamatsu's own hand between 1934 and 1947. The diary, which the magazine \"Chūō Kōron\" obtained, revealed the late prince had opposed the Kwantung Army's incursions in Manchuria in September 1931 and the expansion of the July 1937 Marco Polo Bridge Incident into a full-scale war against China.\n\nPrince Takamatsu died of lung cancer on February 3, 1987 at the Japanese Red Cross Medical Center (, located in Shibuya, Tokyo). His remains were buried at Toshimagaoka Cemetery located in Bunkyō, Tokyo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The united counties then became known as Sayn-Wittgenstein, although it only officially became known as such during the reign of Salentin's successor Count John. The territory of Sayn-Wittgenstein was often divided between northern (centered on Berleburg) and southern (centered on Bad Laasphe) divisions, although the border between the two often shifted. Sayn-Wittgenstein was partitioned in 1607 into: Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg, Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn (in the originally territories of Sayn), and Sayn-Wittgenstein-Wittgenstein. The area of both former counties is known today as \"Wittgenstein\", and is part of the district Siegen-Wittgenstein in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.\n\nFour dynastic branches of the House of Sayn were extant at the beginning of the 20th century, each possessing its own secundogeniture. In order of seniority of legitimate descent from their progenitor, Ludwig I, Count of Sayn-Wittgenstein (1532-1605), they were the:\n\nSome of these lines had junior branches, both dynastic and non-dynastic, the latter including families whose right to the princely title was recognized by the Russian, Prussian, Bavarian or Austrian monarchies, whereas other morganatic branches used lesser titles accorded by German sovereigns (e.g. Baron von Kleydorff, Hesse, 1868; Count von Hachenburg, Prussia, 1883; Baron von Freusburg, Lippe, 1916; Baron von Altenburg, ?, 1909). The last male of the comital line was Ottokar, Count zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (1911-1995). \nOn the death of Ludwig, 3rd Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein in 1912, the eldest of his three sons, Hereditary Prince August (1868-1947), became 4th Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein and head of the third branch of the House of Sayn. Being a childless bachelor, the elder of whose two younger brothers, Georg (1873-1960), had married morganatically, while the younger, Wilhelm (1877-1958), was 49 and yet unmarried, August preserved the name and heritage of his branch of the House of Sayn by adopting Christian Heinrich \"Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg\" (1908-1953). He was the second son of the late head of the entire House of Sayn, Richard, 4th Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (1882-1925), whose eldest son, Gustav Albrecht (1907-1944) had inherited the senior line's fortune and position.\n\nIn November 1960, Christian Heinrich, being the divorced father of two daughters by his dynastic marriage to Beatrix \"Grafin\" von Bismarck-Schönhausen (1921-2006), married Dagmar \"Prinzessin zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein\" (1919-2002), elder daughter of his adopted father's younger brother, Georg, who died seven months before the wedding. As Georg's children by his morganatic wife, Marie Rühm, (created Baroness von Freusburg by the reigning Prince of Lippe in 1916) had been de-morganatized by declaration of their uncle August on 11 February 1947, her marriage to Christian Heinrich was deemed a dynastic match, ensuring that their son Bernhart would be born in compliance with the house laws of his adoptive ancestors, the Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohensteins, as well as being a grandson of the last dynastic male of that family, Prince Georg.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2033297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033297", "title": "Papa Lazarou", "text": "Papa Lazarou\n\nPapa Lazarou is a fictional character in the BBC TV comedy programme \"The League of Gentlemen.\" He appears in four episodes – the first episode in the second series, the Christmas special, the final episode of the third series, and the final episode of the fourth series – and in the film \"The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse\". The character is part-written by and played by Reece Shearsmith. Papa Lazarou has been listed as both the 8th and 14th most popular sketch of all time with British audiences, according to the \"Radio Times\" and Channel 4, respectively.\n\nThe name Papa Lazarou was derived from Peter Papalazarou, who was the landlord of a flat in which Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton lived. The sayings in the show are entirely fictional and for comedy purposes.\n\nPapa Lazarou's first appearance in \"The League of Gentlemen\" is in the first episode of the second series Destination: Royston Vasey. In his first appearance he runs the Pandemonium Carnival, and has three diminutive helpers called Simba, Pebbil, and Tiktik. He is seen to collect wives by forcing his way into women's homes posing as a humble peg-seller, then talking gibberish at them, invariably referring to them as 'Dave', until they hand over their wedding rings. Once they do this, he exclaims, \"You're my wife now!\". His first visit to the town ends when the noses of the circus audience start bleeding simultaneously. Out-weirded by Royston Vasey, he and the other circus performers flee.\n\nLazarou's next appearance is during the Christmas Special, Yule Never Leave. It is revealed that the town vicar Bernice's mother was kidnapped by Lazarou when she was a child. Lazarou then kidnaps Bernice and takes her away with members of his circus troupe at the end of the special.\n\nIn the Third series, Lazarou disguises himself as an Amateur Theatre director called Keith Drop. This alter ego is used as a front to capture more wives. Lazarou uses the makeup tips he has gleaned from his wives to effect a very convincing transformation. As Keith he helps out in the charity shop with Reenie Calver (whose friend, Vinnie Wythenshaw, has been killed in an accident). This is merely a front for Lazarou to gain more wives. Despite being rumbled by Brian and Reenie, he manages to evade capture. It is also revealed that he imprisons his wives and anyone who tries to follow him inside circus animals. In the third series audio commentary the League revealed this is just one of a number of things (many of which haven't been shown) that he does with his captives.\n\nLazarou's most recent appearance was in the 2017 anniversary special, where he used a photo booth to capture a number of Royston Vasey women, including Iris and Tubbs, to create a “wife mine”. It is revealed that the rights to Royston Vasey land were sold to him by current town mayor, Reverend Bernice.\n\nDuring the Comic Aid Telethon to raise fund for relief in the aftermath of the South Asian Tsunami in 2004, Lazarou appeared in a specially written sketch performed live during the telethon, alongside his wife played by Mark Gatiss. During this appearance, Lazarou attempts to kidnap Miranda Richardson, before Tubbs kidnaps her instead.\n\nPapa Lazarou is a demonic circus master and collector of wives. He has a rasping voice, an indefinable accent, and blackface. It is revealed that his skin is actually black and white, and uses pink foundation to appear Caucasian. The character is one of the most bizarre and mysterious of the League's. Some of the women in his 'book of wives', seen in series three, appear to have lived over a century ago. This hints at the character's unnatural lifespan. When he was tied to a bed in the charity shop he reveals he has the supernatural gift of being able to speak with the voices of deceased people he has never met, although it seems he cannot directly commune with the dead, as evidenced by the unconvincing medium act he performed when his circus came to town the previous year.\n\n"}

A three-layer 'sandwich' is made consisting of the pattern (at the bottom), covered with, first, machine-made net and then fine muslin, through which the pattern can be seen. A thick outlining thread is stitched down along the lines of the pattern, sewing net and fabric together. Loops of thread known as 'twirls' are also couched along the outer edge. The excess fabric is then cut away. Some of the net is then usually decorated further with needle-run stitches or small button-holed rings known as 'pops'. Occasionally bars of buttonhole stitches are worked over fabric and net before both are cut away. \n\nCarrickmacross lace was introduced into Ireland in about 1820 by Mrs Grey Porter of Donaghmoyne, who taught it to local women so that they could earn some extra money. \n\nPorter was inspired by some examples of appliqué lace seen while honeymoon in Italy in 1816.\n\nThe scheme was initially of limited success, and it was only after the Great Famine in 1846, when a lace school was set up by the managers of the Bath and Shirley estates at Carrickmacross as a means of helping their starving tenants, that the lace became known and found sales.\n\nIn 2011, Kate Middleton incorporated lace inspired by Carrickmacross lace, amongst others, into her wedding dress.\n"}

The instrument can be made in the key of G, pitched a fourth below the contrabass flute in C and two octaves below the alto flute in G; which is sometimes also called double contra-alto flute, or in C, which will sound three octaves lower than the C flute.\n\nThe subcontrabass flute is rarely used outside of flute ensembles. It is sometimes called the \"gentle giant\" of the flute family because of its gentle sound. At present, the subcontrabass flute is an instrument that must be custom ordered. It may be made out of PVC or metal.\n\nThis instrument's unique sound quality, dark tone, and at times sluggish articulation doesn't make this the best for a solo instrument due to the fact that it is very big and requires much air from the body. A workable range of two and a half octaves the instrument has some projection issues, though the Hogenhuis models designed from PVC can make a fine, vibrant and raucous tone when required. Due to the instrument's bore width (the diameter of the tube is approximately three inches), the sonic possibilities are almost endless, with excellent response to overtones, singing tones, and multiphonics (chord tones). C–G sounds rich and it has great opportunities for dynamic power and accent. A–D The tone becomes less secure and loses some of the lower partials and it is great for blending. E–C has a weaker and somewhat unfocused pitch center which may be a good choice for blend or effect. \n\nThe double contra-alto flute (or \"contrabass flute\"), an instrument in the key of C pitched a fifth lower than the subcontrabass flute in G, is sometimes referred to as a \"subcontrabass flute\", as for, example, in the instruments made by Jelle Hogenhuis.\n\n\"And the Giant Began to Dance...\" (Peter Sheridan), on the album \"\".\n\n"}

The objective of the game is to capture the enemy's capital city.\n\nEach player has to pick one of 4 teams, 3 of which have 5 soldiers (with differing selections of weapons), while one has 2 \"commandos\" and uses a different control system giving greater control.\n\nThe player views the action from an isometric perspective, watching cartoon soldiers duke it out on the battlefield. The game features a balance between action and strategy. For instance, whenever two soldiers on opposite sides get close enough, close combat will ensue. The soldiers can punch, kick, or block the attack. If one of the player's men loses all his health points, he will fall down on the ground. To help the fallen soldier, the player must move the cursor, or another soldier in the case of the commandos, close to the injured soldier and call out for a medic to revive him. However, there is a limit on the number of times that a medic may be called. There are also many items that yield points on the battlefield to pick up.\n\nWith a multiplayer adapter up to four people can play simultaneously against the computer in campaign mode. The player can also fight other human players without co-operation. Another feature of the game is the tutorial mode called “boot camp”.\n\nGunner: Uses a submachine gun as weapon. The well-rounded unit of the game with a medium-range attack and high rate of fire though his gun might jam. It is used primarily for attacking. This characters wears a buzz cut hairstyle.\n\nLauncher: Uses a handheld rocket launcher as a weapon. While the game lacks a \"sniper\" character, the launcher serves essentially the same purpose with a powerful, slow-firing, long-range weapon. The launcher's attack can be stopped by cover but may randomly result in an \"instant death\" of an opposing combatant (reduced to a skeleton and therefore can't call a medic). Can destroy bonus objective targets. This characters wears a helmet.\n\nChucker: Grenades are the weapon of this class. Their attack has a low rate of fire and is easily avoidable but the grenade goes over cover, can damage multiple units, and has good range. Can destroy bonus objective targets. The name and the appearance of this unit (a bearded, blonde man with a Rambo-style headband) is a clear reference to Chuck Norris.\n\nScorcher: Possibly the most dangerous unit in the game, these soldiers use a flamethrower to do damage which, despite having the shortest range, can hit multiple soldiers and is the fastest weapon. Once a Scorcher is on top of another unit, it is very difficult to survive. Because of this capability, they make excellent flanking and escort units. Attack may randomly result in an \"instant death\" of an opposing combatant (reduced to a pile of ash and therefore can't call a medic). If the Scorcher goes into water, his weapon will be temporarily disabled (indicated by bubbles being shot out instead of fire). He wears a pair of dark glasses.\n\nBlaster: Considered the weakest unit in the game and needs to be protected. The Blaster is similar to the Chucker. Instead of using grenades, they throw a bunch of dynamite sticks which goes over cover and inflicts heavy damage. However, they have an extremely slow rate of fire and the second shortest attack range, so they are not as useful. Attack may randomly result in an \"instant death\" of an opposing combatant (reduced to a skeleton and therefore can't call a medic). Can destroy bonus objective targets. This character wears an eye patch, beard and his smile lacks some teeth.\n\nOn September 6, 2013 Brian F. Colin started a Kickstarter campaign in order to fund a sequel. The campaign fell more than $100,000 short of its goal.\n\n\"General Chaos\" received generally positive reviews. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave the game an 8 out of 10, calling it \"the ultimate one-on-one \"fighting\" game!\" They praised the humor, wealth of options, and four-player mode. \"GamePro\" likewise praised the humor and the four-player mode, as well as the enemy AI, and summarized that \"\"General Chaos\" combines brain-squeezing battlefield strategy, challenging squad tactics, and real-time button-pressing combat with humorous cartoon graphics.\"\n\n"}

The area was \"tenryō\" territory under direct control of the shogunate, and the increase in maritime traffic led to the development of merchant and trading firms in the area. In 1720, the shogunate established the post of \"Uraga bugyō\", whose responsibility was to police traffic and to organize coastal defenses, and the entrances to the harbor were fortified with cannon against possible incursions by foreign ships in violation of Japan’s national isolation policy.\n\nStill, in 1812, the British whaler stopped at Uraga and took on water, food, and firewood.\n\nIn 1846, Captain James Biddle of the United States Navy anchored two warships, and in Uraga Channel. This was a first step in what turned out to be an unsuccessful effort to an open trading relationship between Japan and the United States.\n\nOn July 14, 1853, the American Commodore Perry and his Black ships anchored in front of Uraga and subsequently surveyed within the borders of Edo Bay.

{"id": "2033338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033338", "title": "Alaol", "text": "Alaol\n\nSyed Alaol (; 1607 – 1673) was a medieval poet of Bengal. His most well known work is \"Padmavati\", which depicts the story of Padmavati, the Sinhalese princess. He is considered to be one of the most prolific medieval Bengali poets. Since most of his poems combine emotion with intellect, he is called the \"Pandit Kabi\" (Pandit of Poets) of medieval Bengali literature. An important Bangladeshi literary prize, the Alaol Sahitya Puroshkar, is named after him.\n\nHe was probably born in 1607 in the village of Jalalpur in Fatuabad Pargana, Fatehabad, to a minister in the court of Majlis Qutb, the ruler of Fatehabad. He learnt the Bengali, Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit languages. Alaol was kidnapped by Portuguese pirates while travelling on a boat with his father, and was subsequently taken to Arakan.\n\nAlaol worked as a bodyguard for a while, but slowly his reputation as a poet spread. His talent was first recognised by Magan Thakur, prime minister of King Sanda Thudhamma of the Mrauk-U dynasty of Arakan. He was also patronised by other elders of the court such as chief minister Sulayman, royal minister Syed Musa, army commander Muhammad Khan and tax minister Majlis Nabaraj.\n\nIn 1659, he completed \"Sati Mayna O Lorchandrani\", the first part of which was completed earlier by another Bengali court poet of Arakan, Daulat Qazi. He translated \"Tohfa\" at the request of Shrichandra Sudharma or Sanda Thudhamma. Later, Prince Magan Thakur, the foster-son of the sister of King Shrichandra Sudharma and co-regent and the prime minister of Arakan, secured him a place in the court of Arakan.\n\nHis major work, \"Padmavati\", based on Malik Muhammad Jayasi's \"Padmavat\" was written under the patronage of Magan Thakur. He also began writing the \"Saifulmuluk Badiuzzamal\", an adaptation of a Persian work of the same name during this period. There is a famous poem Prince Saiful Malook and Badri Jamala of mystic poet of Punjabi literature Mian Muhammad Bakhsh. After the death of Magan Thakur, he received patronage from Saiyad Muhammad Musa, the army chief of King Shrichandra Sudharma. He translated the \"Haft Peykar\" from Persian as \"Saptapaykar\" in Bengali at his request. In the eulogy of Saptapaykar, Alaol mentioned the arrival of Mughal prince Shah Shuja in Arakan. In 1659, Shah Shuja took refuge in the court at Arakan. In 1660, after the killing of Shah Shuja, Alaol was also thrown out of the Arakan court because of his closeness with him. According to autobiographical passages in his \"Sikandarnama\", he was initially imprisoned. At this juncture, Sayed Masud Shah, a minister or Qazi of the Arakan king gave him shelter. Masud Shah also gave Alaol Khilafat under Qadiriyya Tariqa. Alaol completed his \"Saifulmuluk Badiuzzamal\" at his request. He spent his last days in the court of Majlis Navaraj, another minister of Arakan, where he wrote his last work \"Sikandarnama\" (according to Ahmed Sharif) or \"Dara-Sikandar\" (according to Sukumar Sen), a translation of \"Eskander-nama\" by the Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi.\n\nHis works, apart from \"Ragtalnama\", are adaptations of works in other languages which include:\n\nHis poems draw upon his deep engagement with Sufism.\n\nAlaol Hall, a principal male student dormitory at the University of Chittagong in Bangladesh, is named after him.\n"}

It stars Megumi Okina, Misaki Ito, Takashi Matsuyama, and Yui Ichikawa.\n\n\"Ju-On: The Grudge\" premiered at the Screamfest Film Festival on 18 October 2002, by Lions Gate Films. The film received favourable reviews from critics, but was unfavourably compared to another Japanese horror film, \"Ring\". It has spawned several sequels, an American remake, \"The Grudge\", which was released in October 2004, and a sidequel to the remake, released in January 2020.\n\nSeveral years prior to the main plot, Takeo Saeki murders his wife Kayako after discovering she is in love with another man, also killing the family cat, Mar, and his son, Toshio. The murders create a curse that revives the family as a vengeful ghost, with Kayako's ghost murdering Takeo. Whoever enters the house in Nerima, Tokyo, is eventually consumed by the curse, which spreads to the place they die in and in turn consumes anyone who comes in.\n\nThe latest owners of the house are the Tokunaga family, consisting of salaryman Katsuya, his wife Kazumi, and his ill mother Sachie. Kazumi is quickly consumed by the curse, and Katsuya is emotionally affected by Takeo's personality before dying too. Katsuya's sister Hitomi dies shortly after Kayako's spirit follows her to her office and then her apartment. Social worker Rika is sent by her boss Hirohashi to care for Sachie. She discovers Toshio, and witnesses Sachie being killed by Kayako's ghost, causing her to faint.\n\nHirohashi finds Rika and contacts the police. Detectives Nakagawa and Igarashi discover Katsuya and Kazumi's bodies in the attic, and later learn of Hitomi's disappearance and the death of a security guard at her workplace. Hirohashi's body is discovered, and Rika is haunted by the ghosts. Upon researching the history of the house and the Saeki murders, Nakagawa and Igarashi contact a retired detective named Toyama, who is afraid of revisiting the case. Toyama goes to burn the house down but hears a group of teenage girls upstairs. One flees while the others are consumed. Kayako appears, chasing Toyama away but killing Nakagawa and Igarashi.\n\nElsewhere, Toyama dies at some point and leaves his daughter Izumi behind. As a teenager, Izumi went to the house with her friends but fled while her friends were killed by Kayako; this was the event Toyama witnessed in the past.\n\nIzumi is wrought with guilt for abandoning her friends and becomes increasingly paranoid and unstable. Two of her other friends visit her and discover Izumi and her dead friends have their eyes blackened out in photos. Izumi encounters a vision of her dead father, then discovers the ghosts of her friends watching her. She is cornered by her dead friends, only for Kayako to appear and drag her into damnation.\n\nSome time after visiting the house, Rika has moved on with her life. Her friend Mariko, an elementary school teacher, pays a visit to Toshio, who is registered as her student but has never shown up for class. Rika races to save her but is too late. Kayako's ghost comes after her, and Rika witnesses Kayako briefly take on her appearance. She realizes that she is doomed to play out the curse and the same fate as Kayako. With Toshio watching from the banisters, Takeo’s ghost descends the stairs and kills her.\n\nIn the deserted Tokyo streets, many missing persons posters lie on the ground. Rika's corpse, now with a much longer hairstyle similar to Kayako, lies in the house's attic, only to reawaken with a death rattle.\n\n\nIn 2004, Sony Pictures Entertainment released an American remake of the film. The film was directed by Takashi Shimizu and starring Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jason Behr. The main plot of the film followed Rika's experience within the house but with a different ending. Its sequel, \"The Grudge 2\", however, mirrors a similar ending where Aubrey Davis meets the same fate as Rika.\n\nA second remake/reboot of the original 2004 American film was released on January 3, 2020\n\n\"Ju-on: The Grudge\" was shown on 18 October 2002 at the \"Screamfest Horror Film Festival\" in Los Angeles California under the title \"The Grudge\". The film was also released as part of the Toronto International Film Festival's \"Midnight Madness\" screening in September 2003. The film received a limited theatrical release in the United States on 23 July 2004.\n\nIn the United States, the film grossed a total of $325,680 from 23 July – 9 December 2004.\n\"Ju-on: The Grudge\" was released on DVD by Lions Gate on 9 November 2004. The disc contains an audio commentary with Sam Raimi and Scott Spiegel and interviews with the cast and crew.\n\nA sequel to the film titled \"\" also directed by Shimizu was released in 2003.\n\nAt Metacritic, a website which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 for reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 48, based on 22 reviews indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". \"The Washington Post\" gave the film a mixed reviewing, stating that it \"isn't particularly scary. No, it's much harder on you than mere fright: It's... creepy\" and \"it lacks any interest in conventional narrative and doesn't bother with hero or heroine, or with any sense of coherency, of any mechanism of solution of its mystery.\" David Kehr of \"The New York Times\" compared the film unfavorably to \"The Ring\" (1998), opining that \"Ju-on: The Grudge\" \"turns into a rote series of killings, with each new sequence introduced by a title with the name of its primary victim. Because there is a new hero to identify with every 10 minutes, the viewer isn't drawn into a sustained suspense, but is merely subjected to a series of more or less foreseeable shocks.\" Kim Newman gave the film three stars out of five in \"Empire\", noting that \"As a film, it is at once too much a part of an overarching story and divided into too many episodes to be all of a piece. However, as a sustained collection of scare moments, it's a winner.\" Derek Elley compared the film unfavorably to both \"The Ring\" and \"Dark Water\", writing that \"In the end, “The Grudge” comes down to little more than when and where the ghostly little boy will next appear, and the final explanation is so-what.\"\n\n\n"}

Whenever a player is eliminated, a chair is also removed from the circle. The game resembles a combination of the games Musical chairs and Duck Duck Goose.\n\nIn an outdoor version of the game, the players stand along the side of a large open area, and must run from one side to the other without being tagged when their fruit, or 'turnover', is called. Any player who is caught by the player in the middle must join the player in the middle to help catch players on future moves. Eventually, all players are caught.\n\nA variation of the game, played by older children and young adults, does not make use of fruit names. Instead, the player in the centre calls out the description of a group of people (for example, \"women\", \"people who have been to Kansas\", etc.) and all people in that group are required to move. The only limit on this is that the person in the centre must be a member of the specified group (e.g., only a woman may call on \"women\" to move).\n\nThe most well-known reference in youth culture to Fruits Basket is the anime and manga series of the same name, where it is used as a metaphor for ability to integrate with a social group. In that series, the protagonist Tohru Honda describes that whenever she played the game in school, she was assigned the name \"onigiri\" (rice ball). Although she was fine with this, she later realized that the other children playing never called this name because an onigiri is not a fruit and didn't belong in a fruits basket, thus leaving her sitting as they continued to play. However, at the end of episode 5, when she is accepted into the Sohma family, we see one child call \"onigiri!\" and, smiling, Tohru joins in the game. The series title itself originates from the fact that Tohru previously thought that she could never actually fit in with the Sohma family, just as a rice ball could never belong in a fruits basket, but, being accepted into the family proves otherwise, and she learns that she has a home with them.\n\nThe anime Mitsudomoe makes reference to the game in episode 1 of season 1 but is portrayed in a violent yet humorous way.\n\n"}

Its land area is , and it encloses a deep lagoon with an area of . A winding passage, the Ebon Channel, leads to the lagoon from the southwest edge of the atoll. Ebon Atoll is approximately south of Jaluit, and it is the southernmost land mass of the Marshall Islands, on the southern extremity of the Ralik Chain. In documents and accounts from the 1800s, it was also known as Boston, Covell's Group, Fourteen Islands, and Linnez.\n\nEbon Atoll was a center for commercial whaling in the 19th century. The schooner \"Glencoe\" had been taken and its crew massacred by Marshallese at Ebon in 1851 – one of three vessels attacked in the Marshal Islands in 1851 and 1852. There were several motives, and by some accounts the ship's crew had been abducting island women for sale to plantation owners (slavery) at other destinations.\n\nMissionaries sent by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in Boston began missionary activities in the Marshall Islands in 1857, establishing a mission at Ebon.\n\nEbon was claimed by the Empire of Germany along with the rest of the Marshall Islands in 1884, and the Germans established a trading outpost. After World War I, the island came under the South Seas Mandate of the Empire of Japan, which had a garrison there late in World War II. At the end of WW II, Ebon Atoll became a part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands under the control of the United States, until the independence of the Marshall Islands in 1986.\n\nOn 30 January 2014, castaway José Salvador Alvarenga, a Salvadorian national who had been working in Mexico as a fisherman, was found by locals from Ebon after he had pulled his boat ashore on Enienaitok Islet at the conclusion of a 14 month drifting voyage of 10,800 kilometers (6,700 miles) across the Pacific.\n\nIn the period between 1920 and 1999, different governmental officials have conducted eleven census reports from Ebon, with an average total population of 735 people. The lowest count were under the Japanese colonial power in 1925, with 552 people, and the highest in 1999 – 20 years after independence – with 902 people. The most recent official census, conducted in 2011, has the total population at 706 people. The same report also notes that Ebon is among the atolls and islands of the Marshalls with a positive net migration rate – even though the population has gone down with 196 people since the 1999 census. It is also curious to note that various German sources claim a significantly higher population – ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 people – in a 46 year period, 1860–1906. Moreover, in an unpublished interview series with Leonard Mason in 1949–1950, Dwight Heine (an Ebon local) tells of a legendary typhoon that swept Ebon sometime in the 1850s, the aftermath of which left the atoll population decimated. Before the typhoon hit, Heine says, the Ebon population numbered several thousand.\n\nToday, people permanently inhabit four of the islets on the atoll. The main island, Ebon [Epoon], houses a medical facility and the council house, and has the largest population. Tōkā has fewer residents but is more densely populated than Ebon. The other two are Enekoion [Āne-ko-ion] and Enilok [Āni-look]. Of the four, Āni-look is the only one without an elementary school, so children usually move to family members on Tōkā during school years. Many people have land-rights on other islets and live there sporadically to work with copra production. The islets with the largest production rate are Āne-armej, Kumkumļap, and Enienaitok [Āni-eņ-aetok].\n\nMarshall Islands Public School System operates public schools:\n\nStudents are zoned to Jaluit High School in Jaluit Atoll.\n\n"}

The bricks are archeological artifacts found by Professor Archer Gray, distributed among some of the expedition members for safekeeping. Gray is killed for his 2 bricks, and the gang murders and uses the small bombs to cause other explosions. Gray's daughter, Nellie, is slow to trust Benson, but helps the trio pursue the criminals. She also acts on her own, roughing up criminals independently. The bricks each contain a segment of a golden belt inscribed with directions to huge Aztec treasure. Both Justice Inc. and the criminals have enough information to take them to the vicinity of the treasure in Mexico. In a battle involving hidden temples, Aztec gold, secret passageways, traps, escapes, etc., the criminals are thwarted and fall into their own traps. Justice Inc. ends up with the largest amount of gold in the world to finance its activities.\n\n"}

{"id": "2033426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033426", "title": "Singaporean literature", "text": "Singaporean literature\n\nThe literature of Singapore comprises a collection of literary works by Singaporeans. It is written chiefly in the country's four official languages: English, Malay, Standard Mandarin and Tamil.\n\nWhile Singaporean literary works may be considered as also belonging to the literature of their specific languages, the literature of Singapore is viewed as a distinct body of literature portraying various aspects of Singapore society and forms a significant part of the culture of Singapore. Literature in all four official languages has been translated and showcased in publications such as the literary journal \"Singa\", that was published in the 1980s and 1990s with editors including Edwin Thumboo and Koh Buck Song, as well as in multilingual anthologies such as \"Rhythms: A Singaporean Millennial Anthology Of Poetry\" (2000), in which the poems were all translated three times each into the three languages. A number of Singaporean writers such as Tan Swie Hian and Kuo Pao Kun have contributed work in more than one language. However, such cross-linguistic fertilisation is becoming increasingly rare and it is now increasingly thought that Singapore has four sub-literatures instead of one.\n\nBusiness Times (Singapore) has written that writers in Singapore can also be \"highly experimental\", and quoting the poet, Cyril Wong, literature in the country \"doesn't necessarily mean writing that's on the page. It can be writing that is performed or even writing that is translated into video or images or photographs...including writings that are less tangible. Writings that are expressed through other mediums.\" Singaporean literature has even begun to make its mark on the international stage, with Sonny Liew's graphic novel \"The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye\" winning three Eisner Awards and the Pingprisen for Best International Comic in 2017. \n\nSingaporean literature in English started with the Straits-born Chinese community in the colonial era; it is unclear which was the first work of literature in English published in Singapore, but there is evidence of Singapore literature published as early as the 1830s. The first notable Singaporean work of poetry in English is possibly Teo Poh Leng's \"F.M.S.R.\" This modernist poem was published in 1937 in London under the pseudonym of Francis P. Ng. This was followed by Wang Gungwu's \"Pulse\" in 1950.\n\nWith the independence of Singapore in 1965, a new wave of Singapore writing emerged, led by Edwin Thumboo, Arthur Yap, Robert Yeo, Goh Poh Seng, Lee Tzu Pheng, Chandran Nair and Kirpal Singh. It is telling that many critical essays on Singapore literature name Thumboo's generation, rightly or wrongly, as the first generation of Singapore writers. Poetry is the predominant mode of expression; it has a small but respectable following since independence, and most published works of Singapore writing in English have been in poetry.\n\nThere were varying levels of activity in succeeding decades, with poets in the late 1980s and early 1990s including Simon Tay, Leong Liew Geok, Koh Buck Song, Angeline Yap, Heng Siok Tian and Ho Poh Fun. In the late 1990s, poetry in English in Singapore found a new momentum with a whole new generation of poets born around or after 1965 now actively writing and publishing, not only in Singapore but also internationally. Since the late-1990s, local small presses such as firstfruits, Ethos Books and Math Paper Press have been actively promoting the works of this new wave of poets. Some of the more notable include Boey Kim Cheng, Yong Shu Hoong, Alvin Pang, Cyril Wong, Felix Cheong, Toh Hsien Min, Grace Chia, Topaz Winters, Pooja Nansi and Alfian bin Sa'at (also a playwright). The poetry of this younger generation is often politically aware, transnational and cosmopolitan, yet frequently presents their intensely focused, self-questioning and highly individualised perspectives of Singaporean life, society and culture. Some poets have been labeled confessional for their personalised writing, often dealing with intimate issues such as sexuality.\n\nVerse anthologies have collected and captured various aspects of life in Singapore, from the 1970s onwards, including a few anthologies under the ASEAN series for the literature of Southeast Asia. For example, the coffeetable book \"Singapore: Places, Poems, Paintings\" (1993, edited by Koh Buck Song) featured poems, paintings and reminiscences about 30 significant places ranging from Chinatown to Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, and had an exhibition at the National Museum along with paintings from the book. \"From Boys To Men: A Literary Anthology Of National Service In Singapore\" (2002, edited by Koh Buck Song and Umej Bhatia) examined the meaning of military duty. \"Reflecting On The Merlion\" (2009, edited by Edwin Thumboo and Yeow Kai Chai) brought together about 40 poems about the national tourism symbol. The most authoritative anthology to date is, arguably, \"Writing Singapore: An Historical Anthology Of Singapore Literature\" (2009) edited by Angelia Poon, Philip Holden and Shirley Geok-lin Lim, and published by NUS Press.\n\nChildren's literature in Singapore has gained momentum in recent years due to increased interest in the genre generated by the First Time Writers and Illustrators Initiative which discovered acclaimed writers such as Adeline Foo (\"The Diary of Amos Lee\"), Jin Pyn (\"The Elephant and the Tree\"), Don Bosco (\"Thor the Greatest\"), and Emily Lim (\"Prince Bear and Pauper Bear\"). Jessie Wee, one of the pioneers of children's literature, rereleased her popular \"Mooty Mouse\" series with Marshall Cavendish in 2009. According to the National Library Board, other prominent and prolific children's authors include Patricia Maria Tan, Chia Hearn Chek, Ho MinFong and Bessie Chua.\n\nDrama in English found expression in Goh Poh Seng, who was also a notable poet and novelist, in Robert Yeo, author of six plays, and in Kuo Pao Kun, who also wrote in Chinese, sometimes translating his works into English. The late Kuo was a vital force in the local theatre renaissance in the 1980s and 1990s. He was the artistic director of The Substation for many years. Some of his plays, like \"The Coffin is Too Big for the Hole\" (1984) and \"Lao Jiu\" (1990), have been now considered classics. Stella Kon gained international fame with her now-famous play \"Emily of Emerald Hill\". About an ageing Peranakan matriarch, it has been produced in Scotland, Malaysia and Australia. The sole character has been played by men as well as women. More recent plays have tended to revolve mostly around social issues, especially causes such as gay rights. A few plays by writers such as Tan Tarn How have ventured successfully into the realm of political satire, but their audiences and critical reception remain limited.\n\nFiction writing in English did not start in earnest until after independence. Short stories flourished as a literary form, the novel arrived much later. Goh Poh Seng remains a pioneer in writing novels well before many of the later generation, with titles like \"If We Dream Too Long\" (1972) – widely recognised as the first true Singaporean novel – and \"A Dance of Moths\" (1995).\n\nBeginning as a short story writer, Penang-born Catherine Lim has been Singapore's most widely read author, thanks partly to her first two books of short stories, \"\" (1978) and \"Or Else, The Lightning God and Other Stories\" (1980). These two books were incorporated as texts for the GCE 'O' Levels. Lim's themes of Asian male chauvinistic gender-dominance mark her as a distant cousin to Asian-American writers such as Amy Tan. She has also been writing novels, such as \"The Bondmaid\" (1998) and \"Following the Wrong God Home\" (2001), and publishing them to an international audience since the late 1990s.\n\nHan May is the pseudonym of Joan Hon who is better known for her non-fiction books. Her science-fiction romance \"Star Sapphire\" (1985) won a High Commendation Award from the Book Development Council of Singapore in 1986, the same year when she was also awarded a Commendation prize for her better-known book \"Relatively Speaking\" on her family and childhood memories.\n\nRex Shelley hails from an earlier colonial generation, although he began publishing only in the early 1990s. A Eurasian, his first novel \"The Shrimp People\" (1991) examines the regional Eurasian community and their experience in Singapore. The book won a National Book Prize. His three other novels, \"People of the Pear Tree\" (1993), \"Island in the Centre\" (1995) and \"River of Roses\" (1998) all examine similar themes of the Eurasian community in the Southeast Asia region. He has won the S.E.A. Write Award in 2007.\n\nHaresh Sharma is a playwright who has written more than fifty plays that have been staged all over the world, including Singapore, Melbourne, Glasgow, Birmingham, Cairo and London. In May 2010, his highly acclaimed play \"Those Who Can't, Teach\" was published in book form by the independent publisher Epigram Books.\n\nSu-Chen Christine Lim's works consider varied themes surrounding issues of gender, immigration and orthodoxy. In 1993, her novel, \"Fistful of Colours\", was awarded the first Singapore Literature Prize. Her other novels take up the relationship between the Malays and Chinese immigrants in colonial Malaya, and the issue of land (\"A Bit of Earth\").\n\nGopal Baratham, a neurosurgeon, started as a short story writer and later wrote politically charged works like \"A Candle or the Sun\" (1991) and \"Sayang\" (1991), which courted some controversy when they were first published.\n\nJean Tay is an economist-turned-playwright. Her play \"Everything but the Brain\" won the Best Original Script at The Straits Times' Life! Theatre Awards in 2006. Two of her plays, \"Everything but the Brain\" and \"Boom\", were published in book form by the Singapore-based independent publisher Epigram Books.\n\nAugustine Goh Sin Tub who began his writing career writing in Malay, burst on the literary scene after his retirement with more than a dozen books of short stories, most of which were founded on his own personal history, thus making them part fiction and part non-fiction. Works like \"One Singapore\" and its two sequels \"One Singapore 2\" and \"One Singapore 3\" have found fans among the different strata of Singapore society and well acclaimed by all.\n\nAround this time, younger writers emerged. Claire Tham and Ovidia Yu wrote short stories, while playwright Stella Kon put forth her lesser-known science-fiction novel, \"Eston\" (1995). Of the younger generation, Philip Jeyaretnam has shown promise but has not published a new novel since \"Abraham's Promise\" (1995). His first two books, \"First Loves\" (1987) and \"Raffles Place Ragtime\" (1988), were bestsellers in Singapore.\n\nKelvin Tan, a musician and playwright, has been sporadically in sight, publishing the works \"All Broken Up and Dancing\" (1992) and the \"Nethe(r);R\" (2001). Colin Cheong can perhaps lay claim to being one of Singapore's most prolific contemporary authors, releasing three novels, one novella, two short story collections, and dozens of non-fictional works thus far. He won the Singapore Literature Prize in 1996 for his travel diary-like novel \"Tangerine\". Daren Shiau's \"Heartland\" (1999) traces an eighteen-year-old's rites of passage from junior college through to enlistment and thereafter. The novel has been selected to be a set text at secondary school level.\n\nHwee Hwee Tan graduated with a First Class Honours from the University of East Anglia, and a Masters from Oxford University. She grew up in Singapore and in the Netherlands, and her cosmopolitan experience can be readily seen in her novels. Her snazzy, humorous prose can be read in \"Foreign Bodies\" (1997) and \"Mammon Inc.\" (2001), both published by Penguin Books. Simon Tay, currently the chairperson of Singapore Institute of International Affairs and a former nominated Member of Parliament, has a short story collection and a novel under his belt. These are \"Stand Alone\" (1991) and \"City of Small Blessings\" (2009).\n\nA newer wave of playwrights have emerged included Faith Ng, Joel Tan, Lucas Ho, Nabilah Said, Helmi Yusof and Nur Sabrina Dzulkifli.\n\nSonny Liew, a comic artist/illustrator, won three Eisner Awards in 2017 for Best Writer/Artist, Best U.S. Edition of International Material - Asia, and Best Publication Design, for his graphic novel \"The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye\", which also won the Singapore Literature Prize in 2016. \"The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye\".\n\nThe late 2010s saw a trend of young Singaporean female novelists bringing out novels with international publishing houses based in London and New York. These novelists include Sharlene Teo, Kirstin Chen, Balli Kaur Jaswal, Clarissa Goenawan, Rachel Heng, Thea Lim, Amanda Lee Koe, and Jing-Jing Lee.\n\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of notable Singaporean writers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His role on the show led him to be known as \"America's little brother.\"\n\nGrowing up as a child actor, Rich lived in Granada Hills, California, with his parents and younger brother. The family briefly lived in Dahmer, Florida where he learned how to act at the local gym. He was active in sports, including baseball, football, bicycle riding, skateboarding, and swimming.

There is one truck on Namdrik that transports coconuts from around the island to the dock. There was no fighting on Namdrik Atoll during World War II.\n\nMost buildings on Namdrik are powered by solar power, though there are a few generators on-island. A supply boat stops at Namdrik every month or two, with the large 'Field Trip Ships' usually stopping three times in a year. Ships cannot enter Namdrik's lagoon without banking on a reef, so unloading ships need to wait 'ocean side' for small Namdrik boats to travel between ship and shore to load and unload all of the goods.\n\nNamdrik Atoll made international headlines in November 2011 when two fishermen from Kiribati turned up alive on the island after drifting for thirty-three days at sea.\n\nThe mayor of Namdrik Atoll is Mr. Clarence Luther. The recently deceased senator for Namdrik Atoll wasMattlan Zackhras.\n\nMarshall Islands Public School System operates Namdrik Elementary School.

It originated in Antwerp, where in the 17th century an estimated 50% of the population of Antwerp was involved in lace making. Antwerp lace is also known, from its familiar repeated motif, as Pot Lace— in Dutch Pottenkant or Potten Kant. It is sometimes said that the flowers were a depiction of the Annunciation lilies; however, the flowers were not limited to lilies.\n\nIt is a continuous lace, meaning that it was made in one piece on a lace pillow, using the same threads in the pattern as in the ground, or \"réseau\". Antwerp lace is very similar to Mechlin lace, which was also made in Antwerp. Antwerp lace is heavier and sturdier than Mechlin lace. It has a \"cordonnet\", or a flat thread outlining the pattern, just as Mechlin lace does. The \"cordonnet\" was very strong and rather coarse. Antwerp lace was also similar to Binche lace in its \"cordonnet\". The \"réseau\" or ground for Antwerp lace varies from the same hexagonal ground as Mechlin lace to a tessellation-pattern featuring a six-pointed star.\n\nAntwerp lace was being made during the 16th century. When the Dutch closed the river Scheldt to shipping in 1585 due to Antwerp falling under Spanish control, the production of Antwerp lace halted. By 1698 Antwerp lace was known in England. It first became popular as an export to the Spanish Indies, however when that market died the lace survived in traditional dress among the peasants near Antwerp. It was used mainly for trimming their hats throughout the 18th and 19th century.\n"}

The battle was recounted in Shakespeare’s \"Henry IV, part 1\". Although Humbleton Hill is the modern name of the site, over the centuries it has been variously named Homildon, Hameldun, Holmedon, and Homilheugh.\n\nDuring the time leading to the repudiation of the Truce of Leulinghem, both Kingdoms began to raid the other. On 22 June 1402, a small force backed by the Scots government, returning from one such raid, was attacked and defeated by George Dunbar, the Earl of March's son, at the Battle of Nesbit Moor, at which no quarter was given.\n\nArchibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas, arguably the most militarily powerful man in Scotland, and a key part of the Duke of Albany's administration, used the pretext of Nesbit Moor to lead a punitive expedition into England. With Murdoch of Fife, Albany's son, Douglas's army marched as far as Newcastle to avenge the battle. At the head of 10,000 men, he laid waste to the whole of Northumberland.\n\nMarch persuaded Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, and his son Harry \"Hotspur\" to lie in wait for the returning Scots at Wooler. Once Douglas's men had made camp at Milfield, relatively low ground, the English army rushed to attack. The Scots, however, had keen sentries and the army was able to retreat to the higher ground of Homildon Hill and organise into traditional Schiltron formations; Douglas had not learned from the lesson of his great uncle’s defeat at the Battle of Halidon Hill seventy years previously. The Schiltrons presented a large target for the English Longbowmen, and the formations started to break. A hundred men, under Sir John Swinton of the Swintons of that Ilk, chose to charge the enemy saying: \"\"Better to die in the mellay than be shot down like deer\"\". All perished. It has been suggested that Douglas hesitated to signal the advance of his main force, and when he did, it was too little too late. Douglas's mauled army met the as yet unbloodied English men at arms, and were routed. Many of Douglas's leading captains were captured, including his kinsman George Douglas, 1st Earl of Angus, Thomas Dunbar, 5th Earl of Moray and Murdoch of Fife. Douglas himself was captured having been wounded five times, including the loss of an eye, despite the fact his armour had allegedly taken three years to make.\n\nWith so many of the Scots leaders and chivalry taken prisoner, Albany was left in a precarious position militarily if not politically. It was only due to King Henry's internal and Welsh problems that the English did not press home their victory with a full-scale invasion of Scotland.\nHenry IV was keen that so many able soldiers should not return to Scotland to fight against him, so refused to allow those who held noble captives to ransom them. \nThis act became one of the many grievances that the Percys had with the Crown. In 1403 they allied themselves with Owain Glyndŵr, and went into open rebellion against the English king. Hotspur set his prisoners free, as there was by now no chance of remuneration for them, and many including Douglas decided to join forces with him. Indeed, Douglas fought, and was again badly wounded, at Hotspur's final fight at the Battle of Shrewsbury.\n\nHere is a dear, a true industrious friend,<br>\nSir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.<br>\nStain’d with the variation of each soil<br>\nBetwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;<br>\nAnd he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.<br>\nThe Earl of Douglas is discomfited:<br>\nTen thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,<br>\nBalk’d in their own blood did Sir Walter see<br>\nOn Holmedon’s plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took<br>\nMordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son<br>\nTo beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,<br>\nOf Murray, Angus, and Menteith:<br>\nAnd is not this an honourable spoil?<br>\nA gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?\n\n---Shakespeare, Henry IV, part 1, act 1, scene 1.\n\n\n\nThe site of the battle is now located within the Northumberland National Park. The hill contains the remains of an Iron Age hillfort at the summit, built some 1500 years before the battle. During the medieval period the sides of the ruined fort were apparently used for summer settlements and sheep shelters.\n\nThe Battle Stone at was traditionally thought to commemorate the 1402 battle, but is actually a standing stone dating to the Bronze Age.\n\n\n"}

It was described by Taher Elgamal in 1985.\n\nThe ElGamal signature algorithm is rarely used in practice. A variant developed at the NSA and known as the Digital Signature Algorithm is much more widely used. There are several other variants. The ElGamal signature scheme must not be confused with ElGamal encryption which was also invented by Taher Elgamal.\n\nThe ElGamal signature scheme is a digital signature scheme based on the algebraic properties of modular exponentiation, together with the discrete logarithm problem. The algorithm uses a key pair consisting of a public key and a private key. The private key is used to generate a digital signature for a message, and such a signature can be verified by using the signer's corresponding public key. The digital signature provides message authentication (the receiver can verify the origin of the message), integrity (the receiver can verify that the message has not been modified since it was signed) and non-repudiation (the sender cannot falsely claim that they have not signed the message).\n\nThe ElGamal signature scheme was described by Tahir Elgamal in 1985.\n\nThe scheme involves four operations: key generation (which creates the key pair), key distribution, signing and signature verification.\n\nKey generation has two phases. The first phase is a choice of algorithm parameters which may be shared between different users of the system, while the second phase computes a single key pair for one user.\n\n\nThe algorithm parameters are formula_10. These parameters may be shared between users of the system.\n\nGiven a set of parameters, the second phase computes the key pair for a single user:\nformula_11 is the private key and formula_15 is the public key.\n\nThe signer should send the public key formula_15 to the receiver via a reliable, but not necessarily secret, mechanism. The signer should keep the private key formula_11 secret.\n\nA message formula_18 is signed as follows:\nThe signature is formula_27.\n\nOne can verify that a signature formula_27 is a valid signature for a message formula_18 as follows:\n\nThe algorithm is correct in the sense that a signature generated with the signing algorithm will always be accepted by the verifier.\n\nThe computation of formula_31 during signature generation implies\nSince formula_33 is relatively prime to formula_3,\n\nA third party can forge signatures either by finding the signer's secret key \"x\" or by finding collisions in the hash function formula_36. Both problems are believed to be difficult. However, as of 2011 no tight reduction to a computational hardness assumption is known.\n\nThe signer must be careful to choose a different \"k\" uniformly at random for each signature and to be certain that \"k\", or even partial information about \"k\", is not leaked. Otherwise, an attacker may be able to deduce the secret key \"x\" with reduced difficulty, perhaps enough to allow a practical attack. In particular, if two messages are sent using the same value of \"k\" and the same key, then an attacker can compute \"x\" directly.\n\nThe original paper did not include a hash function as a system parameter. The message \"m\" was used directly in the algorithm instead of \"H(m)\". This enables an attack called existential forgery, as described in section IV of the paper. Pointcheval and Stern generalized that case and described two levels of forgeries:\n\n\n"}

The game is the sequel to the Game Boy Color version of \"Mario Golf\" and the Game Boy Advance counterpart of \"\".\n\n\"Advance Tour\" features an overworld map, where the player can walk around and interact with different courses and objects. On the overworld are the four golfing \"clubs\" (Marion, Palms, Dunes, and Links) which hold tournaments. The player must play in these tournaments to prove themselves to be an \"ultimate golfer\", and earn the right to golf with Mario. There are also side courses, as well as the Custom Club Shop, where a metalsmith will make the player special clubs if they give him a Custom Ticket.\n\nIn each of the four clubs available in \"Mario Golf: Advance Tour\", there are three places of interest: the golf course, the practice area, and the student lodging. The golf course is accessed by entering the tourneys or by playing a practice round. The practice area allows the players to hone their skills by doing various mini-games, as well as play a match against the course leader. Each practice area also features a secret challenge that allows the player to obtain useful items. The student lodging area is only accessible in the Marion course, where Neil and Ella live. One can talk to their doubles partner here, as well as save their game.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the player must choose between one of two characters, Neil or Ella, and play as that character for the rest of the game, with the other character as their doubles partner. Neil and Ella have different strengths: Neil has stronger hitting and a slight draw, while Ella has more precise hitting and a slight fade. By progressing through the game and completing its various elements, the player can gain experience to distribute among the two characters to enhance both their drive as well as their hitting capabilities. As a character levels up, they gain stat points to improve their abilities.\n\n\"Advance Tour\" features four multiplayer modes. In the \"Without Game Link\" mode, two to four players take turns playing on one Game Boy Advance. They can choose a player from the unlocked list of players, pick clubs, and then pick a gameplay mode. Other than the previous mentioned features, this is the same as standard free-play mode. In the \"With Game Link\" mode, each player can select from their own list of characters and clubs, but courses must be mutually unlocked. Otherwise, this is the same as the Without Game Link mode. The Wireless Adapter mode only shows up when the Wireless Adapter is attached to the Game Boy Advance. Otherwise, this is the same as With Game Link mode. In the Club Exchange mode, two players can trade the clubs which they have earned throughout the game via a Game Link Cable or a Wireless Adapter. In the Get Clubs mode, one can receive exclusive Special clubsets (up to 16) from a Wonder Spot using a Wireless Adapter. However, this mode was never used.\n\n\"Advance Tour\" was revealed in late 2003, and created largely by the same team who made \"\" for the Nintendo GameCube. Initially shipped on April 22, 2004 in Japan, the game was also released on June 22, 2004, and September 17, 2004 for North America and Europe respectively. The game also was bundled in Japan with a Wireless Adapter, to go along with the Pokémon releases at the time.\n\nThe game was designed by Shugo Takahashi and Hiroyuki Takahashi, and directed by Yasuhiro Taguchi, all of whom have contributed to the \"Golden Sun\" series, which had graphical elements that were reused in this game and \"\".\n\nIn 2014, the game was re-released on the Wii U Virtual Console on August (PAL) and September (Japan and U.S.A)\n\nSince its release, \"Advance Tour\" received \"favorable\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\nIGN hailed \"Advance Tour\" as \"one of the best golfing games ever\", bestowing the game with an Editors' Choice Award, GameSpy said \"aside from the quirks in graphics and music, there's almost nothing wrong with \"Mario Golf: Advance Tour\"\", and \"Game Informer\" concluded that in \"Advance Tour\" \"handheld golf has never been as much fun.\"\n\nThe RPG elements have also been praised, with 1UP saying \"[the] simple act of leveling up is addictive in itself\" and according to \"EGM\" \"all the extraneous questing, character building, and item collecting just works.\"\n\n"}

He was a key witness in the Alger Hiss trials.\n\nHenry Julian Wadleigh was born in 1904. He went to an English \"public\" school, and then to Oxford where he read classics. He returned to the United States where he received fellowships at the University of Chicago and the Brookings Institution.\n\nIn the early 1930s he started as an economist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. \n\nBecoming more involved with radical politics, he joined the Socialist Party. Later he moved to the State Department, working in the trade agreements division and negotiating trade pacts in Turkey and Italy.\n\nIn the mid-1930s, he became acquainted with Eleanor Nelson, a communist. When Wadleigh, a committed socialist, expressed the desire to act against growing the fascist movement in Europe, Nelson put him in touch with communists in Washington. He passed along documents to the Soviet Union through his main contact, Whittaker Chambers, at the Washington Zoo.\n\nThe defection of Trotsky and subsequent purges in 1937, as well as Wadleigh's work abroad, resulted in infrequent contacts. Soon after, Chambers told him that he had quit the Communist Party, as they both were suspected of being Trotskyites and were in danger of being killed. In August 1939 Stalin signed a non-aggression pact with Hitler, which disgusted Wadleigh, who vowed to have nothing more to do with the communists.\n\nWadleigh stayed at the State Department in the 1940s but felt that his own career stalled because rumors lurked about his communist sympathies. He divorced and remarried around this time. After the Allies invaded Italy in 1943, he was sent to assess food security for the war-stricken population. He shared an apartment in Rome with his brother, Richard Wadleigh, an Army intelligence officer who had led the First Armored Division into the city.\n\nIn 1948, Chambers accused Alger Hiss of being a communist spy. Wadleigh testified before a grand jury and HUAC, and was a key witness in the Hiss prosecution. He did not actually know of Hiss's role, but served to corroborate the role Chambers played. He said he collaborated with communists, but never became a party member. He admitted taking classified documents while working in the State Department for Soviet intelligence. Wadleigh testified on the witness stand that he strongly believed his own transmission of papers to Chambers in the late 1930s \"could not be used against us, but could be used against Germany and Japan.\" As federal prosecutor Thomas Murphy summed up, Wadleigh only wanted to stop the rise of fascism; \"we all came to hate it, but he saw it earlier.\"\nChambers detailed his espionage relationship to Wadleigh as well as events in the Hiss Case in his autobiography \"Witness\" (1952).\n\nTestimony dates include December 9, 1948. Herman Greenberg of Greenberg, Forer & Rein was Wadleigh's legal counsel until shortly before he appeared before HUAC in December 1948. \n\n"}

The remains were found in the process of digging a cellar tunnel for fruit storage on the farm of Martin Concannon. The human remains found consisted of a skull and several large bones from an adult male, as well as a child's mandible.\n\nFurther excavation was conducted by the Bureau of American Ethnology, and many archaeologists and geologists interested in the history and antiquity of man in America visited the site after its discovery. Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin was a notable geologist who put many efforts into examination of the Lansing Man site.\n\nThe remains were found beneath twenty feet of undisturbed deposits, and the geological strata in which the remains lay was dated to anywhere between 10,000 and 35,000 years old, predating the last ice age. The skull was well preserved, and its structure was nearly identical to that of Native Americans that previously inhabited the region.\n\nThe details pertaining to the discovery of Lansing Man created controversy over the antiquity of the remains. Depending on whether morphological or geological evidence was taken into account, different conclusions could be made about dating of the Lansing Man skeletal remains.\n\nThe geological strata in which the remains lay was dated to anywhere between 10,000 and 35,000 years old, predating the last ice age. From a geological dating standpoint, this evidence suggested that the skeletal remains dated back to the glacial period. This information would make the remains a significant finding on the grounds that the glacial period was a time when, previously, no humans were known to inhabit North America.\n\nObserving the structure of the skull, its characteristics were nearly identical to that of the indigenous people of the region. From a morphological standpoint, scientists argued that it was highly unlikely that a species could last through an entire geological period (several thousands of years) without any evolutionary modifications or changes.\n\nBased on this perspective, the significance of the remains was dismissed by most archaeologists as the skeletons were assumed by most not to be as old as the strata in which they were buried.\n\nCurrently the Lansing Man remains belong to a curator of the Kansas City Museum, Mr. M. C. Long, whom had the remains carefully prepared and placed in the United States National Museum.\n\nIn 1973, further analysis was performed on the skeletal remains. William Bass, a staff member of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Tennessee, had Carbon-14 testing conducted on bones of the lower limbs at multiple laboratories. An average of the results from the testing dated the bones to 3579 B.C. These findings suggest that the remains are from the Early Middle Archaic, rather than the Paleoindian. Although the \"Lansing Man\" skeletal remains are not as old as some initially believed, they still remain the oldest human skeletons from Kansas.\n\n\n"}

(Today it's Chomutov in the Czech Republic). He was the son of Florian Gerstner (1730–1783) and Maria Elisabeth, born Englert. He studied at the Jesuits gymnasium in Komotau. After that he studied mathematics and astronomy at the Faculty of Philosophy in Prague between 1772 and 1777. In 1781 he started to study medicine at the University of Vienna, but quickly decided to work in the astronomical observatory instead. In 1789 he became professor of mathematics.\n\nIn 1795 Gerstner became a member of the government commission which tried to improve higher technical education in the Austrian empire. Following his suggestion, the old Prague engineering school \"Institute of Engineering Education\" () founded by Emperor Joseph I, was converted to a polytechnic school in 1803. Gerstner became director of the polytechnic in 1806, and also professor of mechanics and hydraulics. He taught there until 1823, when he was forced to stop due to an illness. The polytechnic still exists today as the Czech Technical University in Prague (ČVUT), and the institute for artificial intelligence and cybernetics research at ČVUT bears the name \"Gerstner Laboratory\".

He helped to build the first iron works and first steam engine in Czech lands. In 1807, he suggested the construction of a horse-drawn railway between the Austrian Empire towns of Budweis (today's České Budějovice) and Linz.

The resort complex is known commercially as Perisher Ski Resort.\n\nThe Indigenous Australian Ngarigo people first inhabited this area. \n\nIn the 1930s, Europeans began summer alpine grazing of sheep and cattle. In the 1850s, gold was discovered on the Thredbo River, although finds were not extensive. Early in the 1900s, Eucalyptus delegatensis (alpine ash) trees were logged in this area, the logs brought to a steam-powered mill on the western side of the river by bullock teams.\n\nTrout were introduced into the streams in the early 1900s for sport fishing and this remains a popular pastime and tourist activity for the area.\n\nIn the 1930s, Howard Bullock, a medical doctor from Sydney, bought a small parcel of flat land in the Thredbo Valley at the confluence of the Thredbo River and the Little Thredbo River.

It is administratively incorporated as a town of oblast significance and serves as the administrative centre of the surrounding Kolomyia Raion (district), which it is administratively not a part of. The city rests approximately halfway between Ivano-Frankivsk and Chernivtsi, in the centre of the historical region of Pokuttya, with which it shares much of its history. The population is .\n\nThe city is a notable railroad hub, as well as an industrial centre (textiles, shoes, metallurgical plant, machine works, wood and paper industry). It is a centre of Hutsul culture. At the turn of the 20th century the city was the most populous city in Stanisławów Voivodeship.\n\nThe settlement of Kolomyia was first mentioned by the Hypatian Chronicle in 1240 and the Galician–Volhynian Chronicle in 1241 a time of the Mongol invasion of Rus'. Initially part of Kievan Rus', it later belonged to one of its successor states, the principality of Halych-Volhynia. On the order of Boroldai, the city fortress was burnt down in 1259.\n\nIn 1340 it was annexed to Poland by King Casimir III, together with the rest of the region of Red Ruthenia. Sometime in the 1340s, another fortress was erected there. In a short time the settlement became one of the most notable centres of commerce in the area. Because of that, the population rose rapidly.\n\nPrior to 1353 there were two parishes in the settlement, one for Catholics and the other for Orthodox. In 1388 the king Władysław Jagiełło was forced by the war with the Teutonic Order to pawn the area of Pokuttya to the hospodar of Moldavia, Petru II. Although the city remained under Polish sovereignty, the income of the customs offices in the area was given to the Moldavians, after which time the debt was repaid. In 1412 the king erected a Dominican order monastery and a stone-built church there.\n\nIn 1405 the town's city rights were confirmed and it was granted with the Magdeburg Law, which allowed the burghers limited self-governance. This move made the development of the area faster and Kołomyja, as it was called then, attracted many settlers from many parts of Europe. Apart from the local Ukrainians and Poles, many Armenians, Jews, and Hungarians settled there. In 1411 the fortress-city was given away for 25 years to the Vlach Hospodar Olexander as a gift for his support in the war against Hungary. In 1443, a year before his death, King Wladislaus II of Poland granted the city yet another privilege which allowed the burghers to trade salt, one of the most precious minerals of the Middle Ages.\n\nSince the castle gradually fell into disarray, in 1448 King Casimir IV of Poland gave the castle on the hill above the town to Maria, widow of Eliah, voivode of Moldavia as a dowry. In exchange, she refurbished the castle and reinforced it. In 1456 the town was granted yet another privilege. This time the king allowed the town authorities to stop all merchants passing by the town, and force them to sell their goods at the local market. This gave the town an additional boost, especially as the region was one of three salt-producing areas in Poland (the other two being Wieliczka and Bochnia), both not far from Kraków.\n\nThe area was relatively peaceful for the next century. However, the vacuum after the decline of the Golden Horde started to be filled by yet another power in the area: the Ottoman Empire. In 1485 Sultan Beyazid II captured Belgorod and Kilia, two ports on the northern shores of the Black Sea. This became a direct threat to Moldavia. In search of allies, its ruler Ştefan cel Mare came to Kolomyia and paid homage to the Polish king, thus becoming a vassal of the Polish Crown. For the ceremony, both monarchs came with roughly 20,000 knights, which was probably the biggest festivity ever held in the town. After the festivity most knights returned home, apart from 3,000 under Jan Karnkowski, who were given to the Moldavian prince as support in his battles, which he won in the end. In 1490 the city was sacked by the riot of Ivan Mukha.\n\nHowever, with the death of Stefan of Moldova, the neighbouring state started to experience both internal and external pressure from the Turks. As a consequence of border skirmishes, as well as natural disasters, the town was struck by fires in 1502, 1505, 1513, and 1520.\n\nWładysław II Jagiełło, needing financial support in his battles against the Teutonic Knights, used the region as a guarantee in a loan which he obtained from Petru II of Moldavia, who thus gained control of Pokuttya in 1388. Therefore, it became the feudal property of the princes of Moldavia, but remained within the Kingdom of Poland.\"\n\nAfter the Battle of the Cosmin Forest, in 1498, Pokuttia was conquered by Stephen the Great, annexed and retained by Moldavia until the Battle of Obertyn in 1531, when it was recaptured by Poland's hetman Jan Tarnowski, who defeated Stephen's son Petru Rareş. Minor Polish-Moldavian clashes for Pokuttia continued for the next 15 years, until Petru Rareş's death.\n\nThe following year, hetman Jan Tarnowski recaptured the town and defeated the Moldavians in the Battle of Obertyn. This victory secured the city's existence for the following years, but the Ottoman power grew and Poland's southern border remained insecure.\n\nIn 1589, the Turks crossed the border and seized Kolomyia almost immediately. All the burghers who had taken part in the defence were slaughtered, while the rest were forced to pay high indemnities.\n\nThe town was returned to Poland soon afterwards, but the city's growth lost its momentum.\n\nIn 1620, another Polono-Turkish war broke out. After the Polish defeat at Ţuţora, Kolomyia was yet again seized by the Turks. In 1626 the town was burned to the ground, while all of residents were enslaved in a jasyr.\n\nAfter the war the area yet again returned to Poland. With the town in ruins, the starosta of Kamieniec Podolski fortress financed its reconstruction – slightly further away from the Prut River. The town was rebuilt, but never regained its power and remained one of many similar-scaled centres in the area.\n\nDuring the Khmelnytskyi Uprising in 1648–54, the Kolomyia county became a centre of a peasant unrest (Pokuttya Uprising) led by Semen Vysochan. The rebels' centre was a town of Otynia. With the help of incoming Cossack forces, Vysochan managed to overtake the important local fortress of Pniv (today – a village of Nadvirna Raion) and eventually managed to take under its control most of cities and villages in the region providing great support for the advancing Cossack forces of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi. Soon however with advancing Polish troops, Vysochan was forced to retreat to the eastern Podillya where he continued to fight under commands of Ivan Bohun and Ivan Sirko.\n\nIn the 17th century the city's outskirts saw another peasant rebellion led by Oleksa Dovbush. The rebels were known as opryshky.\n\nAs a result of the first of Partitions of Poland (Treaty of St. Petersburg dated 5 July 1772), Kolomyia was attributed to the Habsburg Monarchy. More details about the history of Galicia can be read in the article Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria.\n\nHowever, as it provided very little profit, Kolomyia was sold to the castellan of Bełz, Ewaryst Kuropatnicki, who became the town's owner. The magnate financed a new Our Lady's Church, but he lacked the financial means to accelerate the city's growth.\nProsperity returned to the town in the mid-19th century, when it was linked to the world through the Lemberg-Czernowitz railroad. By 1882 the city had almost 24,000 inhabitants, including roughly 12,000 Jews, 6,000 Ruthenians, and 4,000 Poles. Until the end of that century, commerce attracted even more inhabitants from all over Galicia. Moreover, a new Jesuit Catholic church was built in Kolomyia, as it was called by German authorities, along with a Lutheran church built in 1874. By 1901 the number of inhabitants grew to 34,188, approximately half of them Jews.\n\nIn 1900 the Jewish population was 16,568, again nearly 50% of the town's population. The Jewish community had a Great Synagogue, and about 30 other synagogues. In 1910 Jews were prohibited from selling alcoholic beverages. In 1911 they were prohibited from salt and wine occupations.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Great War, the town saw fierce battles between the forces of the Russian Empire and Austria-Hungary. Jews were abused for supposedly supporting the Austrians, and many Jewish homes were ransacked and destroyed.\n\nThe Russian advance occupied the town in September 1914.\n\nIn 1915 the Austrians retook the town.\n\nAs a result of the collapse of Austria-Hungary, both the town itself and the surrounding region became disputed between renascent Poland and the West Ukrainian People's Republic.\n\nHowever, during the Polish-Ukrainian War of 1919, it was seized without a fight by forces of Romania, and handed over to Polish authorities. According to the Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedia, it was taken over by the Polish bourgeoisie and land owners. During the Polish-Bolshevik 1919 war in Ukraine, a Polish division under General Zeligowski tore through Bessarabia and Bukovina and stopped in Kolomyia during its winter march to Poland. Kolomyia was then temporarily occupied by the Romanians and the border was near the town (shtetl) Otynia between Stanislav and Kolomyia.\n\nAfter the Polish-Soviet War it remained in Poland as a capital of a powiat within the Stanisławów Voivodship. By 1931 the number of inhabitants grew to over 41,000. The ethnic mixture was composed of Jews, Poles, Ukrainians (including Hutsuls), Germans, Armenians, and Hungarians, as well as of descendants of Valachians and other nationalities of former Austria-Hungary. With the development of infrastructure, the town became a major railroad hub, as well as the garrison city of the 49th Hutsul Rifle Regiment. In the interbellum period, every Thursday a market took place at the main square of the town. The town had a monument to Polish poet Franciszek Karpinski, a monument to Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, and an obelisk near the town, located in a spot where in 1485 hospodar Stephen III of Moldavia paid tribute to king Kazimierz IV Jagiellon. In 1920-30s workers' strikes took place in the city, possibly organized by the Communist Party of Western Ukraine that was established in Kolomyia in 1923.\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War II with the Invasion of Poland of 1939, the town was thought of as one of the centres of Polish defence of the so-called Romanian Bridgehead.\n\nHowever, the Soviet invasion from the east made these plans obsolete, and the town was occupied by the Red Army.\n\nAs a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the occupied town became a part of the Soviet Union as a region of the Ukrainian SSR. The accession of the Western Ukraine to the Soviet Union (Reunion of Western Ukraine and USSR) – the adoption of the Soviet Union in Western Ukraine with the adoption of an Extraordinary Session V of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR Law \"On the inclusion of the Western Ukraine in the Soviet Union to the reunification of the Ukrainian SSR\" (1 November 1939) at the request of the Commission of the Plenipotentiary of the People's Assembly of Western Ukraine. The decision to file motions stipulated in the Declaration \"On joining of Western Ukraine in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic\" was adopted by the People's Assembly of Western Ukraine in Lviv, 27 October 1939.\n\nOn 14 November 1939, the Third Extraordinary Session of the Supreme Soviet of USSR decided: \"Accept Western Ukraine in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, and thus reunite the great Ukrainian people in a unified Ukrainian state.\"\n\nIn 1940 part of the local population were arrested by the NKVD, and sent to the Gulag system or to various Soviet prisons among which were Polish, Ukrainians, Hungarians, and many others.\n\nIn 1941, the town was seized by Nazi Germany. During the German occupation most of the city's Jews were murdered by the German occupation authorities. Initial street executions of September and October 1941 took the lives of approximately 500 people. The following year the remaining Jews were massed in a local ghetto, and then murdered in various concentration camps, mostly in Bełżec. Several hundred Jews were kept as slave workers in a labour camp, and then murdered in 1943 in a forest near Sheparivtsi.\n\nThe Red Army liberated Kolomyia from the German invaders on 28 March 1944. Soon after that many construction workers, teachers, doctors, engineers and other skilled professionals began to arrive to restore the ruined city. They arrived from the eastern part of Ukraine and other parts of the Soviet Union.\n\nDuring the Cold War the town was the headquarters of the 44th Rocket Division of the Strategic Rocket Forces, which had previously been the 73rd Engineer Brigade RVGK at Kamyshin. The division was disbanded on 31 March 1990.\n\nIt is now a part of Ukraine, independent since 1991.\n\nBy the time of independence the vast majority of industrial enterprises of Kolomyia had closed or had been eliminated: Plant \"Kolomyiasilmash\", \"Zahotzerno\", plant \"Elektroosnastka\", factory \"September 17\", a shoe factory, a woodworking factory, plant KRP (complete switchgears),the printing house on Valova St.,a brush manufacturer, a weaving factory and many others. Also shut down were movie theatres; there had been four: Irchan movie theatre, Kirov movie theatre, movie theatre \"Yunist\" (Youth), and a summer theatre in the present Trylovskoho park (formerly named Kirov park). A film store of regional importance also closed down. As a result, many people found themselves unemployed, and many town residents felt forced to move abroad to find work. Those companies that have remained from the Soviet era barely function. These include a curtain factory, a paper mill, Metalozavod, Plant PRUT (programmable electronic educational terminals),a cheese factory, \"Kolomyiasilmash\", Kolomyia Plant management of building materials, Kolomyia Motor Company, a paper mill, a clothes factory on Valova St, a printing house on Mazepa St., and a canned fruit plant.\n\nMost of these companies were widely known in the former Soviet Union and abroad, as they were highly advanced in terms of equipment, skilled workers, and engineering staff. These enterprises produced many products, with people working in several shifts, and providing the city with received significant tax revenues.\n\nIt is a sister city of Nysa in Poland, to which many of its former inhabitants had to move after the war.\n\nSince late 2015, Kolomyia has been the headquarters of the Ukrainian 10th Mountain Brigade.\n\n\nKolomyia is famous for its Pysanka Museum, that was built in 2000.\n\nThe museum was opened on 23 September 2000, during the 10th International Hutsul festival. Director Yaroslava Tkachuk first came up with the idea of a museum in the shape of a pysanka, local artists Vasyl Andrushko and Myroslav Yasinskyi brought the idea to life. The museum is not only shaped like an egg (14 m in height and 10 m in diameter), but parts of the exterior and interior of the dome are painted to resemble a pysanka.\n\nKolomyia is twinned with:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The single was produced by Jerry Kennedy.\n\nThe song was included in Robert Christgau's \"Basic Record Library\" of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in \"\" (1981).\n\nOriginally cut for Pappy Daily's D label, the recording was purchased by Mercury Records and released in the summer of 1958, just over six months after Chuck Berry released \"Sweet Little Sixteen,\" which uses the same chord progression. The song reached #6 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and spent 22 weeks on the national Top 40. It was the third most played song of 1958. On the \"Cash Box\" chart, \"Chantilly Lace\" reached number four.\n\nA 1972 version by Jerry Lee Lewis was for three weeks a No.1 hit on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles chart and a top fifty pop hit in the US and a Top 40 pop hit in the UK.\n\nThe song depicts a young man flirting with his girlfriend on the telephone and listing things about her that he likes, including:\n\nChantilly lace and a pretty face\nAnd a pony tail hangin' down\nA wiggle in her walk and a giggle in her talk\nMake the world go 'round.\nThe song begins with the sound of a telephone ringing, and is answered by the Big Bopper shouting:\n\n\"HELLO BABY\"\n\nThe \"Hello Baby\" motif reappears in the Big Bopper's follow-up song \"Big Bopper's Wedding,\" in which the singer is so distracted by the bridesmaids that the impatient preacher demands, \"Do you or don't you take this woman?\"\n\n\"Chantilly Lace\" inspired an answer song performed by Jayne Mansfield, titled \"That Makes It”, hypothetically based on what the girl may have been saying at the other end of the line.\n\nBopper 486609 - Donna Dameron ( Dart 113 -1959), was an answer record. Donna Dameron was rumoured to be The Big Bopper's mother, Elsie Richardson.\n\nThe phrase \"Oh, baby, you know what I like\" was sampled by Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers in the music collage track \"That's What I Like\", which also included samples from Jerry Lee Lewis, Chubby Checker, The Surfaris, The Ventures, and other rock and roll singers and bands from late 1950s to early 1960s scene.\n\nVan Halen's song \"Good Enough\", from the 1986 album \"5150\", begins with singer Sammy Hagar's calling out \"Hello Baby\", imitating the Big Bopper's vocal hook in \"Chantilly Lace\".\n\nIvor Biggun, alias Doc Cox, recorded an unsyncopated cockney/novelty version of the song for his 1987 album “Partners in Grime”, altering the lyrics somewhat to include phrases such as “oh you little bobby-dazzler”, “but me bicycle’s broken” and “me mummy insists that I be in bed by half-past 10”.\n\nMotown R&B singer Shorty Long recorded the song in 1966 and his version was released as a single on the company's Soul subsidiary label the following year.\n\nThe Rolling Stones performed a version of the song in their live-set in Germany featuring Ian Stewart on piano and Bobby Keys on tenor sax during the group's Rolling Stones European Tour 1982.\n\nR.

The company was one of the largest suppliers of kitchens and bedroom furniture in the United Kingdom, and operated mainly in retail parks in out of town locations. Anecdotally, it was said at one stage that one in three Sunday lunches in the United Kingdom were cooked in a kitchen from MFI, and 60% of British children were conceived in a bedroom from MFI.\n\nAfter success in its early decades, it experienced recurring financial problems accompanied by several changes of ownership, and on 26 November 2008, it was announced that the business had been placed into administration. Merchant Equity Partners, headed by Henry Jackson, was the last company to own it, before it was sold to the management in September 2008 for a \"small profit\".\n\nThe business ceased trading by 19 December 2008, after the administrators failed to find a buyer.\n\nIt struggled to make profits during the 2000s, as chains such as B&Q and Argos introduced their own furniture lines, and rival chain IKEA (who arrived in the United Kingdom in the last half of the 1980s) expanded. Following its closure, the MFI brand was purchased by Victoria Plumb, and was relaunched as an online only retailer on 30 November 2011 only for it to cease trading again in July 2015.\n\nFollowing a rebrand in 2015, Victoria Plumb became VictoriaPlum.com and announced that it was to expand into other home product categories. As part of this expansion, VictoriaPlum.com announced on 17 March 2016 that it was set to revive the MFI brand name, to represent its exclusive collection of low cost, value for money bedroom furniture.\n\nThe MFI Retail business was founded in 1964 as Mullard Furniture Industries by two British men, Noel Lister and Donald Searle, who previously traded in war surplus goods. It was named after Searle's wife's maiden name. The company became a public company in 1971, as MFI Warehouses (the Group). An external manager, Derek Hunt, was recruited soon afterwards.\n\nIn 1982, owners of Hygena, Norcros, were looking to dissolve the company and sell the Hygena name. This was purchased jointly in 1982 by MFI Group and Malcolm Healey's company; Humber Kitchens.\n\nIn the 1980s, the group entered into partnerships, notably in 1985 with Asda. The Asda connection was soon dissolved over concerns about the company's future, and there was a management buy-out in October 1987. Also in MFI took full control of Hygena in 1987, buying Healey out for £200 million. In November 1988, MFI acquired Schreiber Furniture.\n\nWith the advent of out of town shopping during the 1980s, MFI Retail opened a host of stores in such developments. In 1985, it was the very first tenant of the Merry Hill Shopping Centre at Brierley Hill in the West Midlands, opening a new store, which within four years, was part of the largest shopping complex in Western Europe.\n\nMFI Retail gained a new rival in October 1987, when Swedish furniture retailer IKEA began trading in Britain, and expanded over the coming years. Soon afterwards, DIY retail giant B&Q expanded into the furniture market, and emerged as a surprise new rival for the business. Despite this, the MFI Group was still expanding in November 2002, when it took over Sofa Workshop.\n\nDuring 2004 to 2005, serious and highly publicised IT problems affecting customers damaged MFI Retail's credibility, and the finance director and chief operating officer left the Group.\n\nBy 2005, it was clear that MFI Retail's fortunes were declining. Despite the British economy still being strong and recession not even on the horizon, it was reported that sales for 2005 had fallen to £742 million compared to £854 million in 2003. In September 2006, the MFI Retail business was acquired by Merchant Equity Partners for £1 after which the parent company changed its name to Galiform.\n\nIn December 2006, Argos overtook MFI as the United Kingdom's largest furniture retailer. MFI Retail was the subject of a second management buyout in September 2008, but by this stage the British economy was sliding into recession, unemployment was rising and retail sales were falling. MFI's future was looking bleak.\n\nEarly on 25 November 2008, the BBC first reported the possibility of MFI Retail going into administration, with MFI desiring a three-month rent free period from landlords. Later the following day, it was announced that no agreement could be reached and PropertyWeek reported that Menzies Corporate Restructuring had been appointed as administrators.\n\nOn 26 November 2008, after a board meeting MFI went into administration. The company was unable to confirm what would happen to consumers with pending orders. On 19 December 2008, all 111 MFI stores were closed with the loss of 1,200 jobs.\n\nMFI Retail operated over two hundred stores across the United Kingdom, all of between 15,000 & . Home deliveries amounted for over fifty million items a year, going to 2.5 million households in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe business had sought to upgrade many aspects of its operations, including greater focus on customer service; updating and improving the product range; improving utilisation of floor space; establishing closer supplier relationships; investing in logistics, IT, supply systems and product development and enhancing internal communications.\n\nIt offered a full range of furniture for bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens, lounges, dining rooms and home offices. It was particularly associated with self assembly furniture. Its products were mainly targeted to value oriented customers with the \"Hygena\" brand, and those on a higher income with the \"Schreiber\" brand. MFI was also one of the largest suppliers of installed appliances in the United Kingdom with its own brand \"Diplomat\".\n\nNew and exclusive to MFI was its \"Space Genie\" range which were ingenious storage solutions for the kitchen and bedroom. MFI sold beds directly from Silentnight, Rest Assured and Layezee, and also sold dining furniture from The Chair Company. Other MFI brands included \"Viva Sofa\" and \"The Bath Co.\"\n\nMFI Retail had been criticised, for the excessive frequency and length of its sales. In a six-month survey by consumer magazine \"Which?\", it emerged that four out of five kitchens in the \"sale\" had never actually been sold at the higher price against which the discount claims were being made.\n\n\"Which?\" stated that \"MFI's pricing policy deceived its customers into thinking they are getting a better deal than they are. In some cases, its pricing is downright misleading\". MFI's advertising of such sales also came in for criticism for using phrases such as \"Hurry! Only four days left\" or \"Prices too good to last\" even though a new sale would almost always be launched immediately afterwards.\n\nMFI Retail was also known for being one of the first ever companies to be investigated by the BBC programme \"Watchdog\". The programme attempted to buy a £600 kitchen advertised by MFI, though the price only actually included kitchen units and not the appliances shown. When the Watchdog crew arrived at a branch of the company, they were immediately confronted by a manager who evicted them from the store.\n\nIn September 2007, MFI Retail was forced to withdraw a television advert featuring a woman slapping her husband in the face twice and shouting at him for leaving the toilet seat up. Those complaining felt that the advert trivialised the issue of domestic violence against men. The ASA concluded that it \"was likely to cause serious or widespread offence to viewers and could be seen to condone intimidation, domestic violence and aggression as an acceptable way to resolve issues\".\n\nThe ASA went as far as to state that \"it could also cause social, moral or psychological harm to children\" and they were \"concerned that it had been broadcast at all\". As a result, the advertisement was banned.\n"}

He was noted for bringing a Marxist perspective to the study of power, class and relations between planters and slaves in the South. His book \"Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made\" won the Bancroft Prize. He later abandoned the left and Marxism and embraced traditionalist conservatism.\n\nHe wrote during the Cold War and his political beliefs, at the time, were considered highly controversial.\n\nGenovese was born on May 19, 1930, in Brooklyn, New York. His father was an immigrant dockworker and Eugene was raised in a working-class Italian American family.\n\nIn 1945, at the age of 15, he joined the Communist Party USA, and was active in the youth movement until he was expelled in 1950, at the age of 20, for disregarding party discipline or, as he said, \"for having zigged when [he] was supposed to zag.\" He earned his Bachelor of Arts from Brooklyn College in 1953 and his Master of Arts in 1955 and a Ph.D. in history in 1959, both from Columbia University. He taught at another dozen universities, including Yale, Cambridge and Rutgers.\n\nHe was later discharged from army service for his communist leanings, and despite these experiences, he remained a Marxist thinker until the 1980s.\n\nGenovese first taught at Brooklyn's Polytechnic Institute from 1958 to 1963. During the early years of the Vietnam War, when there was a growing range of opinions about the war and the Civil Rights Movement, he was a controversial figure as a history professor at Rutgers University (1963–67), and at the University of Rochester (1969–86), where he was elected chairman of the Department of History.\n\nFrom 1986, Genovese taught part-time at the College of William and Mary, Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Georgia, Emory University and Georgia State University. He was an editor of \"Studies on the Left\" and \"Marxist Perspectives\". He was famous for his disputes with colleagues left, right and center. Defeating Oscar Handlin in 1978, he was elected as the first Marxist president of the Organization of American Historians.\n\nIn 1998, after moving to the right in his thinking, Genovese founded The Historical Society, with the goal of bringing together historians united by a traditional methodology.\n\nAt an April 23, 1965, teach-in at Rutgers University where he was teaching, Genovese stated, \"Those of you who know me know that I am a Marxist and a Socialist. Therefore, unlike most of my distinguished colleagues here this morning, I do not fear or regret the impending Viet Cong victory in Vietnam. I welcome it.\" This comment was widely reported and generated a backlash of criticism. Politicians questioned Genovese's judgment and sensitivity to the responsibility inherent in being a Rutgers professor. Richard M. Nixon, then out of office and living in New York, denounced him, and the Republican candidate for governor of New Jersey, Wayne Dumont, challenging Governor Richard J. Hughes, used Genovese's statement as a campaign issue, demanding that Hughes dismiss Genovese from the state university. Bumper stickers saying “Rid Rutgers of Reds” popped up on cars across the state. Genovese insisted that he did not mean to say that he hoped American servicemen would be killed. No state laws or university regulations had been broken, and Genovese was supported by fellow faculty members on grounds of academic freedom. He was not dismissed from his teaching position.\n\nRutgers President Mason Gross refused to re-examine the university's position, and Dumont lost to Governor Hughes. President Gross' defense of academic freedom was honored by the American Association of University Professors, who presented him and Rutgers with its Alexander Meiklejohn Award in 1966. Genovese moved to Canada and taught at Sir George Williams University in Montreal (1967–69). In 1968, Genovese signed the “Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.\n\nAt the 1969 convention of the American Historical Association, radical historians Staughton Lynd and Arthur Waskow, speaking on behalf of the Radical Caucus, introduced and later withdrew a resolution demanding an end to not only to the war in Vietnam but also the repression of the Black Panther party. A substitute resolution introduced by the radical scholar Blanche W. Cook \"deplored and condemned\" the war and urged withdrawal of all American troops. It was Cook’s resolution that eventually came to a vote.\n\nDuring the discussion on the resolution, Genovese gave a speech, saying that although he opposed the Vietnam war, if the radicals' resolution passed, the bulk of historians in the AHA, who favored the war, would be forced to resign from the group. Noting that the majority of Americans also supported the war, Genovese said that those citizens were as moral and deserving of being heard as the war’s opponents. The Radical Caucus, he said, were a bunch of \"totalitarians.\" Genovese ended his speech by saying that the time had come for historians to isolate and defeat the New Left and \"put them down, put them down hard, once and for all.\" When the vote was finally taken, the resolution lost, 647 to 611.\n\nIn 1968, Genovese wrote a critical historiography of the major studies of slavery in the Americas from a hemispheric perspective. He considered the demand by Marxist anthropologist Marvin Harris in \"The Nature of Cultural Things\" (1964) for a materialist alternative to the idealistic framework of Frank Tannenbaum, Stanley Elkins, Gilberto Freyre, and others. Tannenbaum had first introduced the hemispheric perspective by showing that the current status of blacks in various societies of the Western Hemisphere had roots in the attitude toward the black as a slave, which reflected the total religious, legal, and moral history of the enslaving whites. Tannenbaum ignored the material foundations of slave society, most particularly class relations. Later students have qualified his perspectives but have worked within the framework of an \"idealistic\" interpretation. Harris, on the other hand, insisted that material conditions determined social relations and necessarily prevailed over counter-tendencies in the historical tradition. Harris' work revealed him to be an economic determinist and, as such, ahistorical. By attempting to construct a materialism that bypassed ideological and psychological elements in the formation of social classes, he passed into a \"variant of vulgar Marxism\" and offered only soulless mechanism.\n\nIn the 1960s, Genovese in his Marxist stage depicted the masters of the slaves as part of a \"seigneurial\" society that was anti-modern, pre-bourgeois and pre-capitalist. In 1970, Stampp reviewing Genovese's \"The World the Slaveholders Made\" (1969) found fault with the quantity and quality of the evidence used to support the book's arguments. He took issue with the attempt to apply a Marxian interpretation to the Southern slave system.\n\nIn his best-known book, \"Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made\" (1974), Genovese examined the society of the slaves. This book won the Bancroft Prize in 1975. Genovese viewed the antebellum South as a closed and organically united paternalist society that exploited and attempted to dehumanize the slaves. Genovese paid close attention to the role of religion as a form of resistance in the daily life of the slaves, because slaves used it to claim a sense of humanity. He redefined resistance to slavery as all efforts by which slaves rejected their status as slaves, including their religion, music, and the culture they built, as well as work slowdowns, periodic disappearances, and escapes and open rebellions.\n\nGenovese applied Antonio Gramsci's theory of cultural hegemony to the slave South. As Dennis Dworkin expresses it, \"Like [E.P.] Thompson... Genovese deployed Gramsci's ideas. For Genovese, the slaveholding society of the Old South was rooted in exploitative class relationships, but most important was the cultural hegemony of slaveholders, their paternalistic ideology establishing both the potential and limits for a semiautonomous slave culture of resistance.\"\n\nGenovese placed paternalism at the center of the master-slave relationship. Both masters and slaves embraced paternalism but for different reasons and with varying notions of what paternalism meant. For the slaveowners, paternalism allowed them to think of themselves as benevolent and to justify their appropriation of their slaves' labor. Paternalist ideology, they believed, also gave the institution of slavery a more benign face and helped deflate the increasingly strong abolitionist critique of the institution. Slaves, on the other hand, recognized that paternalist ideology could be twisted to suit their own ends by providing them with improved living and working conditions. Slaves struggled mightily to convert the benevolent \"gifts\" or \"privileges\" bestowed upon them by their masters into customary rights that masters would not violate. The reciprocity of paternalism could work to the slaves' advantage by allowing them to demand more humane treatment from their masters. Religion was an important theme in \"Roll, Jordan, Roll\" and other studies. Genovese noted that Evangelicals recognized slavery as the root of Southern ills and sought some reforms, but from the early decades of the early nineteenth century, they abandoned arguing for abolition or substantial change of the system. Genovese's contention was that after 1830, southern Christianity became part of social control of the slaves. He also argued that the slaves' religion was not conducive to millenarianism or a revolutionary political tradition. Rather, it helped them survive and resist.\n\nKing (1979) argued that Genovese incorporated the theoretical concepts of certain 20th-century revisionist Marxists, especially the ideas of Antonio Gramsci and his construct of hegemony. Genovese's analysis of slavery, the blacks, and the American South elicited criticisms of various portions of his work, but historians agreed on the importance of his contributions. Areas of criticism included Genovese's placing of the master-slave relationship at the center of his interpretation of the American South, his views on southern white guilt over slavery, his employment of Gramsci's construct of hegemony, and his interpretations of southern white class interests, slave religion, the strength of the slave family, the existence of slave culture, and the theory of the generation of black nationalism in the antebellum years.\n\nIn his 1979 book \"From Rebellion to Revolution\", Genovese depicted a change in slave rebellions from attempts to win freedom to an effort to overthrow slavery as a social system. In the 1983 book that he co-wrote with his wife, \"The Fruits of Merchant Capital\", Genovese underscored what he regarded as tensions between bourgeois property and slavery. In the view of the Genoveses, slavery was a \"hybrid system\" that was both pre-capitalist and capitalist.\n\nStarting in the 1990s, Genovese turned his attention to the history of conservatism in the South, a tradition which he came to adopt and celebrate. In his study, \"The Southern Tradition: the Achievements and Limitations of an American Conservatism\", he examined the Southern Agrarians. In the 1930s, these critics and poets collectively wrote \"I'll Take My Stand\", their critique of Enlightenment humanism. He concluded that by recognizing human sinfulness and limitation, the critics more accurately described human nature than did other thinkers. He argued that the Southern Agrarians also posed a challenge to modern American conservatives who believe in market capitalism's compatibility with traditional social values and family structures. Genovese agreed with the Agrarians in concluding that capitalism destroyed those institutions. \n\nIn his personal views, Genovese moved to the right. While he once denounced liberalism from a radical left perspective, he now did so as a traditionalist conservative. His change in thinking included abandoning atheism and re-embracing Catholicism, the faith in which he had been raised, in December 1996. His wife, historian Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, had also shifted her thinking and converted to Catholicism.\n\nIn 1969, Genovese married Elizabeth Fox (died 2007), a historian. In 2008, he published a tribute to her, \"Miss Betsey: A Memoir of Marriage\". Genovese died in 2012, aged 82, from a \"worsening cardiac ailment\" in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n\n\n"}

It displays the signal as a two-dimensional \"xy\"-plane scatter diagram in the complex plane at symbol sampling instants. The angle of a point, measured counterclockwise from the horizontal axis, represents the phase shift of the carrier wave from a reference phase. The distance of a point from the origin represents a measure of the amplitude or power of the signal.\n\nIn a digital modulation system, information is transmitted as a series of samples, each occupying a uniform time slot. During each sample, the carrier wave has a constant amplitude and phase, which is restricted to one of a finite number of values. So each sample encodes one of a finite number of \"symbols\", which in turn represent one or more binary digits (bits) of information. Each symbol is encoded as a different combination of amplitude and phase of the carrier, so each symbol is represented by a point on the constellation diagram, called a \"constellation point\". The constellation diagram shows all the possible symbols that can be transmitted by the system as a collection of points. In a frequency or phase modulated signal, the signal amplitude is constant, so the points lie on a circle around the origin.\n\nThe carrier representing each symbol can be created by adding together different amounts of a cosine wave representing the \"I\" or \"in-phase\" carrier, and a sine wave, shifted by 90° from the I carrier called the \"Q\" or \"quadrature\" carrier. Thus each symbol can be represented by a complex number, and the constellation diagram can be regarded as a complex plane, with the horizontal real axis representing the I component and the vertical imaginary axis representing the Q component. A coherent detector is able to independently demodulate these carriers. This principle of using two independently modulated carriers is the foundation of quadrature modulation. In pure phase modulation, the phase of the modulating symbol is the phase of the carrier itself and this is the best representation of the modulated signal.\n\nA 'signal space diagram' is an ideal constellation diagram showing the correct position of the point representing each symbol. After passing through a communication channel, due to electronic noise or distortion added to the signal, the amplitude and phase received by the demodulator may differ from the correct value for the symbol. When plotted on a constellation diagram the point representing that received sample will be offset from the correct position for that symbol. An electronic test instrument called a vector signal analyzer can display the constellation diagram of a digital signal by sampling the signal and plotting each received symbol as a point. The result is a 'ball' or 'cloud' of points surrounding each symbol position. Measured constellation diagrams can be used to recognize the type of interference and distortion in a signal.\n\nThe number of constellation points in a diagram gives the size of the \"alphabet\" of symbols that can be transmitted by each sample, and so determines the number of bits transmitted per sample. It is usually a power of 2. A diagram with four points, for example, represents a modulation scheme that can separately encode all 4 combinations of two bits: 00, 01, 10, and 11 and so can transmit two bits per sample. Thus in general a modulation with formula_1 constellation points transmits formula_2 bits per sample.\n\nAfter passing through the communication channel the signal is decoded by a demodulator. The function of the demodulator is to classify each sample as a symbol. The set of sample values which the demodulator classifies as a given symbol can be represented by a region in the plane drawn around each constellation point. If noise causes the point representing a sample to stray into the region representing another symbol, the demodulator will misidentify that sample as the other symbol, resulting in a symbol error. Most demodulators choose, as its estimate of what was actually transmitted, the constellation point which is closest (in a Euclidean distance sense) to that of the received sample; this is called maximum likelihood detection. On the constellation diagram these detection regions can be easily represented by dividing the plane by lines equidistant from each adjacent pair of points.\n\nOne half the distance between each pair of neighboring points is the amplitude of additive noise or distortion required to cause one of the points to be misidentified as the other, and thus cause a symbol error. Therefore, the further the points are separated from one another, the greater the noise immunity of the modulation. Practical modulation systems are designed to maximize the minimum noise needed to cause a symbol error; on the constellation diagram this means that the distance between each pair of adjacent points is equal.\n\nThe received signal quality can be analyzed by displaying the constellation diagram of the signal at the receiver on a vector signal analyzer. Some types of distortion show up as characteristic patterns on the diagram:\n\nA constellation diagram visualises phenomena similar to those an eye pattern does for one-dimensional signals. The eye pattern can be used to see timing jitter in one dimension of modulation.\n\n"}

He is considered the most important writer of Argentina after Jorge Luis Borges according to Martin Kohan and the best Argentine writer of the second half of the 20th century according to Beatriz Sarlo. \n\nFour of his novels - \"La Pesquisa\", \"El Entenado\", \"\" and \"\" - appear on various lists made by Latin American and Spanish writers and critics of the best 100 books in the Spanish language of the last 25 years For his novel \"La Ocasión\" he won the Nadal Prize in 1987. In 1990, he won the Silver Condor Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film \"\".\n\nBorn to Syrian-Lebanese immigrants in Serodino, a small town in the Santa Fe Province, Saer studied law and philosophy at the National University of the Litoral, where he taught \"History of Cinematography\". \n\nThanks to a scholarship, he moved to Paris in 1968 where he taught at the University of Rennes. He had recently retired from his position as a lecturer at the University of Rennes, and had almost finished his final novel, \"La Grande\" (2005), which has since been published posthumously, along with a series of critical articles on Latin American and European writers, \"Trabajos\" (2006). \n\nIn the year 2012, a first installment of his previously unpublished working notebooks were edited and published as \"Papeles de trabajo\" by Seix Barral in Argentina. A second volume soon followed, which was the result of five years of editing work by a team coordinated by Julio Premat, who wrote the introduction of the first volume. These notebooks allow readers a privileged insight into the creative processes of Saer. As critics point out, the books of Juan José Saer may be taken as a single \"oeuvre\", set in his \"La Zona\", a fluvial region around the Argentinian city of Santa Fé, populated by characters who are developed and become referential from novel to novel.\nSaer's novels frequently thematize the situation of the self-exiled writer through the figures of two twin brothers, one of whom remained in Argentina during the dictatorship, while the other, like Saer himself, moved to Paris; several of his novels trace their separate and intertwining fates, along with those of a host of other characters who alternate between foreground and background from work to work. Like several of his contemporaries (Ricardo Piglia, César Aira, Roberto Bolaño), Saer's work often builds on particular and highly codified genres, such as detective fiction (\"The Investigation\"), colonial encounters (\"The Witness\"), travelogues (\"El río sin orillas\"), or canonical modern writers (e.g. Proust, in \"La mayor\" and Joyce, in \"Sombras sobre vidrio esmerilado\").\n\nHe developed lung cancer, and died in Paris in 2005, at age 67. His body is buried in the Parisian cemetery of Père-Lachaise. \n\n\n"}

Along with textile tycoon Benjamin Bates, he founded the first coeducational university in New England (the Bates College) which is widely considered his \"magnum opus.\" Cheney is one of the most extensively covered subjects of Neoabolitionism, for his public denouncement of slavery, involuntary servitude, and advocation for fair and equal representation, egalitarianism, and personal sovereignty.\n\nCheney's main social ideology was that of egalitarianism; he personally voiced his disdain for racial inequality, social elitism, and socioeconomic depravation regularly, in controversial speeches and articles. He was ordained a minister in his early twenties, became the headmaster at Parsonsfield, Maine, and illegally harbored and transferred slaves to safety during the 1840s in New Hampshire–an action punishable with a decade's jail time by the federal Fugitive Slave acts. His religious community work garnered him widespread support, culminating in his nomination for a seat in the Maine House of Representatives without his knowledge. Having been told he was nominated and elected on his way to his induction ceremony, Cheney would go on to be an able Free Soil legislator. His first bills drafted and passed supported state prohibition, advocated for temperance, regulated liquor traffic (notably the passage of the Maine Liquor Law), and provided the funds for his first school–the Lebanon Academy in Lebanon, Maine. He gave many abolitionist speeches to the legislature, which produced mixed reactions and death threats; historians have occasionally noted him as \"completely and utterly careless with his life.\"\n\nHe was elected as the only delegate to attend the 1852 Free Soil Party Convention in Pittsburgh from Maine, where he famously advocated for anti-slavery, and physically threatened the owner of a local tavern for refusing to serve Frederick Douglass, a noted abolitionist and black member of the party. After his political career, he continued to publish anti-slavery pieces in his newspaper, and establish the Maine State Seminary, which would later be named \"Bates College.\" He governed as the first President of Bates College for nearly four decades–from 1855 to 1894–creating its liberal arts curriculum, hiring faculty, and choosing its campus; during this time he adopted the moniker O.B. Cheney.\n\nOren Burbank Cheney was born in Holderness, New Hampshire, on December 10, 1816. He was born to Abigail and Moses Cheney, who were noted abolitionists. Cheney's brother, Person, would go on to become a prominent politician in New Hampshire. His father was a paper manufacturer and also a conductor on the Underground Railroad. Moses Cheney held important positions in the church and served many times in the state legislature. Cheney's mother had a significant impact on his religious views, he was often quoted as saying, \"my mother used this bible to worship all that is holy, I shall cease when I arise to the heavenly skies that welcome me,\" later in his life as president of Bates College. His household was deeply religious and he credited his \"Godly upbringing\" with forming his philosophical ideologies and personal convictions.\n\nEarly in his life he was known as a \"humble, patient, and soft-spoken boy.\" When he was eight years old, he was enrolled in Sunday School in Holderness, and his parents were criticized for sending him to a newly founded school, as it was started by a cashier who found God later in life and was not considered \"God's child from birth.\" He began to work at age nine at the school and spent his allowance on honey and gingerbread, considered luxuries at the time. His rebellious side was exposed on numerous occasions, most notably when a Free Will Baptist came to the family's house to recite lessons, Cheney jumped and stabbed the windowsill with his jack-knife scaring everyone in the room, which formed an ongoing reputation of the young boy. Soon after Sunday School, Cheney began to work at his father's paper mill, tending to the engines, and housekeeping, at night. The paper he would form would go on to print the very first copy of The Morning Star, the single most important newspaper of Free Will Baptists. At age thirteen, he attended the New Hampton Academical and Theological Institute in 1829-30, which was five miles away, his mother's decision to send him so far way was partly based off Cheney's unhealthy interest with knives; he cut the end of his thumb while husking corn. Cheney's demanding personality was developed quickly as he taught at elementary schools during his time at New Hampton. A notable example of this was when a drunken father stumbled into the school yard accusing a young Cheney of disciplining his child in unfair ways, Cheney drew his measuring stick and quieted the man. While at the New Hampton Institute, he was exposed to Free Will Baptism at personal level through his studies, and peers, and soon after returned to his father's mill. After the mill was sustainable through the hiring of other local school boys, Cheney was sent to Parsonsfield Seminary, which was 14 miles away; a three-day trip.\n\nWhile going through Parsonsfield, he was surrounded by racial segregation and religious oppression and later in life, sought an educational institution that catered to everyone that required it, that would take the form of a rigorous, and academically prominent school. He was interested in the temperance movement early on and founded his school's temperance society.\n\nIn 1836, Cheney enrolled in Brown University, but while in Providence witnessed mobs violently treating people with the same religious and political beliefs as he had. Although he was excited by the commotion involved, he decided he was better off studying at a school that offered him a higher degree of physical safety. He transferred to Dartmouth College, due to their significant tolerance of abolitionism. His choice was also heavily influenced by the Dartmouth College v. Woodward case which would later become a guiding case in the foundation of Bates College. Soon after being admitted, he accepted a teaching position in Canaan, New Hampshire but his goals were hindered before he could seriously impact the communities' politics. During the night, the townspeople rode ox with the building strapped to wooden rollers into the swamp and left it there unattended. Cheney enrolled in Dartmouth in 1836, and founded a missionary organization that helped in the education of Indians. He felt a deep connection with the college, and was reported meditating near the grave of Eleazar Wheelock, the founder of the college. While at the college, he participated in numerous outings with classmates to anti-slavery meetings in Hanover. He described the events as:A crowd of men and boys with drums and horns for the purpose of making a disturbance... Boys were allowed to vote at the age of twenty-one, so they voted in the interest of the anti-slavery movement... The waving of handkerchiefs by women young and old, and the cheers from the crowd showed how great a victory we had over the pro-slavery spirit that was thought to have crushed us.In May 1836, he walked back to his old home in Ashland, New Hampshire, a trek of 40 miles, walking due to financial restrictions, to be baptized. On his way back to Dartmouth, he began to devote himself to teaching and academia, supplementing his income by pursuing teaching jobs around New Hampshire. He graduated from the university in 1839. He returned to Parsonsfield, a stop on the Underground Railroad, for several years in the 1840s as an alumnus and went on to lead the school as its head master. He founded the Lebanon Academy in Lebanon, Maine in 1850. During this time, he worked for the Underground Railroad, and along with his second brother, Elias Hutchins, illegally harbored and transferred slaves from Windy Row, New Hampshire to Hancock. This was, under the federal Fugitive Slave acts, highly illegal. His reputation earned him a visit from noted abolitionist, Frederick Douglass, who stayed at his home during the 1840 New England Anti-Slavery Society Convention. It was reported that during this time four slave bounty hunters went missing in Hancock.\n\nOn January 30, 1840, he married Caroline A. Rundlett and they had one child, Horace Rundlett Cheney. He later attended the Free Will Baptist Bible School in Whitestown, New York to study theology but had to leave following his wife's death in June 1846. In 1844, Cheney was ordained as a Free Will Baptist minister, however, he left the ministership after some years due to their position on slavery. In 1847, the widower Cheney married Nancy S. Perkins. They had two children, Caroline and Emeline. Nancy died in 1886. In July 1892, Cheney married Emeline S. Burlingame, a widow, who survived him. His only son, Horace Cheney, was admitted to Bowdoin College in Brunswick as one of the 100 students allowed to study at the university during the early 19th century.\n\nCheney's political efficacy started at a young age, but his first official political declaration was to be his first vote in which he cast a vote for James G. Briney, a member of the Liberty Party. Briney lost the elections in the Maine House of Representatives, however, one year later, Cheney was nominated without his anyone telling him he was nominated. He won the elections in early December 1851, and while on trip to speak with community leaders in Augusta, aids told him that he had been nominated and elected to the legislature. They took a detour and he was inducted as a Member of the Maine House of Representatives representing the 86th district of Augusta, Maine later that day. His early tenure in the legislature as a Free Soil politician was tacked to state prohibition, he first bills drafted and passed limited the outlawed the sale of alcohol in Maine, with the Maine Liquor Law, and regulated the consumption of it on a district-by-district basis. Cheney also went on to begin to make speeches in the legislature on the principles of abolitionism and egalitarianism to mixed reception. When a congressman asked him to stop giving speeches on the abolition of slavery and the prohibition of alcohol, Cheney replied: \"a pile of gold as high as the mountains would not tempt me to stop speaking upon those topic.\"\n\nDuring his tenure as a state respective he acquired his fathers Free Will Baptist newspaper, \"The Morning Star\". He used the newspaper as a medium for him to print his speeches in the legislature and to write articles supporting abolitionism. His assumption of the newspaper drew attention of a past acquaintance, Frederick Douglass. Cheney asserted in his first printing as owner: We shall speak against slavery, as we have hitherto done. We can find no language that has the power to express the hatred we have towards so vile and so wicked an institution-We hate it-we abhor, we lather it-wedetest it and despise it as a giant sin against God. His later career in the Maine House of Representatives, secured $2,000 for his academy in Lebanon, regulated liquor traffic, and advocated for temperance. He left his academy shortly after founding it in strong financial conduction and under the care of the local community.\n\nShortly, before the conclusion his term, he was elected as the delegate to the 1852 Free Soil Party Convention in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. During the scheduled speeches at the convention he drew widespread controversy for his speech regarding complete and absolute abolitionism. At the time, the Free Soil Party only believed in anti-slavery not abolitionism. On the final night of the convention the delegates were invited to a local tavern of the State House where they were free to dine with each other. Upon entering the establishment, Frederick Douglass, a fellow delegate was stopped at the door and Cheney was told that \"the nigger must not come in.\" After an intense yelling match between members of the delegation and the owner, Cheney stepped forward and physically the threatened the owner with a beating and told him that if Douglass was not seated first, before anyone else, the entire delegation was to eat elsewhere. With fear of safety and loss of business, the owner conceded and seated Douglass. The event sent a powerful message to the convention, however, the mental stability of Cheney was rumored to be faulty by members of both sides of the convention.\n\nOne year later in 1853, he was assigned as a delegate to Free Will Baptist General Conference, and participated in numerous talks that helped establish a political link to the movement. He choose not to seek another term in the Maine Legislature due to his increasingly ineffective legislation giving blacks quasi-rights failed. After stepping down from political office on November 3, 1854, he continued his work with \"The Morning Star\". One the evening of his retirement from political life, he printed one of his more famous lines on the cover of the newspaper:Live and take comfort. Thou hast left behind powers that will work for thee, air, earth, and skies. Theres not breathing of a common mind that will forget thee. Thou has great allies.He switched his political affiliation to the Republican Party, due to their liberal and democratic stance on slavery and personal sovereignty. He spent the rest of his life developing the party within Maine.\n\nAfter news spread to Cheney that his old secondary school, Parsonsfield Seminary, mysteriously burned down in 1853, he began to plan the construction of a new school. Opponents of his political work and abolitionism in general were rumored to be the arsonists behind the destruction of Parsonsfield. Cheney wrote the details of the event in a diary: \"the bell tower flickered in flames while the children ran from its pillar-brick walls..\" The fire was believed to have killed three school children, and two fugitive slaves, leading to a brief and unsuccessful investigation.\n\nCheney went back to the Maine State legislature and used his political sway to bypass certain legal proceedings and begin the incorporation of a new school. He began the process by meeting with the religious, political, and social elites of Maine in Topsham to discuss the formation of a new seminary. His idea was met with positive reception and the act of incorporation was drafted. Of the one required, twenty-four petitions were submitted to the Maine State Legislature. After minimal delay, the charter was approved and appropriated with $15,000 for its conception. With the school being established Cheney wrote to Massachusetts Congressman and one of the most established anti-slavery radicals in the country, Charles Sumner, requesting a university motto. Sumner replied with \"Amore ac Studio\" which means \"with ardor and devotion\" but is translated as \"with love of learning\".Construction of the school began in Parsonsfield, Maine, however, the project drew the attention of millionaire textile tycoon, Benjamin Bates, who took special interest in the college. He convinced Cheney to build his school in the economically booming town of Lewiston, where Bates had begun to develop highly profitable mills. The college was moved to the town and incorporated as the Maine State Seminary on March 16, 1855.\n\nThe charter petition paid particular attention to fellow Maine colleges, Bowdoin and Colby College in Brunswick and Waterville, respectively. Cheney wrote specifically with regard to the two colleges:We do not propose an Academy [referring to Colby College (then Waterville Academy)], but a school of higher order, between a college [referring to Bowdoin College] and an Academy. We shall petition the state legislature to suitably endow, as well as incorporate, such an institution. We know our claim is good and intend openly and manfully and we trust in a Christian spirit to press it. If we fail next winter, we shall try another legislature. If we fail on a second trial, we shall try a third and a fourth.The Maine State Seminary was founded on the principles of egalitarianism and scholarship. It opened officially in 1865 with one hundred and thirty-seven students and three societies: the Literary Fraternity, Philomathean Society and Ladies' Athenaeum. The school gained a reputation of exacting academic standards and for educating the working class of Maine. The college stood in firm contrast to Bowdoin College in that it advocated for equality and equal access. However, the relationship between the two colleges is complex. The only college Cheney would oversee was Bowdoin, he served as an overseer from 1860 to 1867. In 1860, Cheney delivered the graduating dress to a class of fifteen male students, stressing \"impact in a changing world.\"Benjamin Bates began to aggressively fund the college due to its increased status in Americana academia and values. He extended a principle $50,000 dollars to Cheney and at the end of his life, his overall contributions spaned nearly $300,000.\n\nDeeply moved by the financial backing of Bates, Cheney asked the board of the Seminary to rename the college in his honor. Bates College was chartered on March 16, 1864. Cheney required that admission to Bates be exacting and required testimonials of good moral character, readings of Latin which included Caesar, Cicero, Vergil and elementary French. Cheney made sure that Bates was originally affiliated with the Freewill Baptist denomination and later with the Northern Baptist churches. He often noted Dartmouth v. United States, a Supreme Court case in reinforcing his beliefs that \"a college can never pass into the hands of any other people or party without the consent of these churches or their proper representatives.\"\n\nDuring the Civil War, Cheney was stirred and encouraged students to fight in the war as a test of their convictions, he said to an incoming class, \"the freemen of the north are ready. Slavery must die. I am ready to die for freedom\", causing them question the dynamic involved at the school as this was not a student but the President asserting such a statement.\n\nIn 1891, Cheney amended the charter to Bates to require that its president and a majority of the trustees be members of the Free Will Baptist denomination. After he retired, this amendment was revoked by the legislature in 1907 at the request of his successor, George Colby Chase, which allowed the college to qualify for Carnegie Foundation funding for professor pensions.\n\nCheney served as Bates' president for 39 years, retiring at age 79 in 1894. Cheney died in 1903 and was buried in Riverside Cemetery in Lewiston.\n\nCheney also played a major role in founding several other Free Baptist institutions such as Storer College, a school for freed slaves in West Virginia founded in 1867; and the Maine Central Institute (MCI), founded in 1866. Cheney founded and was the first president of the Free Will Baptist Church at Ocean Park, Maine, a seaside retreat on Old Orchard Beach. In 1907, his third wife, Emeline, wrote a biography of his life, using his diaries and autobiographical articles he had published in the \"Morning Star\". The Cheney House, built in 1875 when Cheney was president, was acquired in 1905 by Bates College. Today it is used as a dormitory, a \"quiet house\" for 32 students.\n\n\n\n"}

It was a biennial event through 2006, and annually after that. It has been hosted at Purdue University six times, but the 2007 symposium was held in Japan; the 2009 at Arizona State University, the 2010 in Murcia, Spain; the 2011 in Taipei, Taiwan; and the 2013 will be held at Shandong University, Jinan, China.\n\nIn June 2005, the TESOL Board added of a new interest section on writing. The Second Language Writing IS; it held its first meeting in Tampa in March 2006, covering topics ranging from \"Broadening Perspectives in Second Language Writing\" and \"Alternative Placement Methods for Second Language Writers\" to \"Issues in Technologies for L2 Composition Classrooms\" and \"Crossing Bridges with Second Language Writing Partnerships.\"\n\nAs these suggest, the section provides a forum for researchers and educators at different grade levels and institutional settings to discuss second language writing. Specifically, the section's goals are:\n\n\nThe section facilitates communication about writing across teaching levels and settings. Recent research on the scope of second language writing scholarship suggests that most of the field's nationally (within the U.S.) and internationally circulated scholarship is produced by scholars in post-secondary education at research intensive institutions. Other contexts for writing (Pre-K through 12, two-year colleges, community programs, international K-12 schools, etc.) often have much larger populations of ELL/EFL writers, but scholars, particularly teacher-researchers, in these settings do not often receive support for researching and writing.\n\nGiven this, the section provides scholars with the opportunity to initiate more research and scholarship in these underrepresented contexts by supporting new collaborations and partnerships across levels and by providing a forum for discussing shared experiences. The section, like its parent body, TESOL, is distinctive in including all the academic levels and areas.\n\nSecond language writing scholars also participate in a Special Interest Group on the field at CCCC. In addition, the organization has a Committee on Second Language Writing to bridge work between CCCC and TESOL to involve more scholars in the field's discussions.\n\nMuch recent attention focuses on the potential of computer-mediated communication (CMC) to foster desire and opportunity to write.\n\nIn addition, attention has been focused on the practical application of teaching Second Language writing not only in academia but in the field. \n\nSecond language writing development has been investigated from many different perspectives. Manchón's edited book on \"L2 Writing Development: Multiple Perspectives\" provides an insight in which perspective second language writing development can be investigated. Her edited books includes studies on L2 writing development from dynamic systems theory, goal theory, genre-based systemic functional linguistics, and rhetorical genre theory.\n\nSecond language writing development has been most extensively investigated by traditional cross-sectional methodologies such as pre-test post-test designs.\n\nHowever, in the early 2000s a novel angle has emerged called dynamical systems theory approach on second language development. Studies adopting the DST perspective explore interactions between different constructs such as lexicon, syntax, and accuracy by using moving correlations. The degree of variability in the constructs is usually explored by min-max graphs, data resampling and Monte Carlo Analysis. Among the researchers who have adopted this new angle are Verspoor, de Bot, and Lowie.

Written by Noel Gallagher, it is the fourth Oasis song to feature Liam and Noel on lead vocals, the first being \"Acquiesce\", the second being \"Put Yer Money Where Yer Mouth Is\" and the third being \"Born on a Different Cloud\". It was released on 28 November 2005 as the third single from the album in the United Kingdom (see 2005 in British music), and the second single in the United States.\n\n\"Let There Be Love\" reached number two on the UK Singles Chart and peaked atop the Scottish Singles Chart, capping a very successful year for the band in the UK. In Ireland, the song reached number 14, becoming the band's 21st top 20 single there. Outside the British Isles, the song reached number two in Italy, but was it a minor hit elsewhere, only managing to reach the top 90 in Germany and the Netherlands.\n\nMany critics cited this song as proof that Oasis had returned to the form seen in the mid-1990s.\n\nA demo for the track was recorded during demo sessions for \"Standing on the Shoulder of Giants\". A bootleg of these demo sessions was leaked onto the Internet in early 2000. This track was given the unofficial title \"It's a Crime\" on many bootlegs as the track was unknown and unreferenced anywhere before then. The album version of the song is structurally almost exactly the same as the demo with a slight change in melody in the part that Noel sings. The lyrics to the chorus remains intact, but the verses and bridge have totally rewritten lyrics.\n\nThe single version of the song omits the second verse and chorus.\n\nA second, Noel-sung demo was released on the \"Let There Be Love\" DVD single. It has the same lyrics as the album version, and in fact the album version takes some elements from the demo such as the piano. It was probably recorded sometime in 2003 or 2004, prior to the main \"Don't Believe the Truth\" recording sessions.\n\nThe video is a montage of some of Oasis' live shows during the summer of 2005 including clips of the gigs at Hampden Park and the City of Manchester Stadium. The clips do not actually show the band playing 'Let There Be Love', as the band didn't play the song at either of these gigs. Later, the video clip appeared on their Don't Believe the Truth tour rockumentary, \"Lord Don't Slow Me Down\".\n\nThe song has only been played live twice, the first on an Italian radio show in late 2005 and the second closing a concert in Santiago de Chile, in 2006. However, both were acoustic performances featuring only Noel Gallagher. Oasis also performed the song on several television shows, such as BBC's Top of the Pops, but these TV performances were done by playback, so the song was never actually performed live by the entire band.

It is the main river of the Sucumbíos province. In the last part of its course it is the Ecuadorian-Peruvian border. It empties into the Napo River. It has a length of , of which the last of its course extend along the natural border between Ecuador and Peru (in the department of Loreto). The lower course of the Aguarico River was finalized and legally fixed as part of the long-disputed Ecuador-Peru frontier according to The Rio de Janeiro Protocol of 1942. Ecuador unilaterally denounced the protocol in 1960, however a new agreement was signed in 1999 validating the pre-existing protocol.\n\nThe Aguarico river is a river that flows almost completely by the province of Sucumbíos, in the north of Ecuador, being the main river of the province. In its average course it flows closely near the Reserve of Production Faunística Cuyabeno. In the last part of its course it flows near the Ecuadorian-Peruvian border. Finally it ends at the Napo river, in the same border, a little over the locality the town of Pantoja in Loreto, Peru.\n\nIn 1541, Gonzalo Pizarro and Francisco de Orellana constructed a sailboat, the San Pedro, and followed the courses of the Coca River and the Napo River until the confluence of the Napo with the Aguarico River and the Curaray River, where they lacked the proper amount of provisions and supplies, including food. Several men did not survive, and it is estimated that 140 of 220 Spaniards and 3,000 of the 4,000 Indians who composed the expedition were amongst this number. They decided then (22 February 1542) that Orellana would continue down the Aguarico River in search of food. They accompanied about fifty men to go with him. Incapable to overcome the river, Orellana waited for Pizarro. Finally Pizarro sent three men with a message to Orellana for him to begin the construction of a new boat, the Victoria. Meanwhile, Pizarro had returned towards Quito by another route towards the north, with only 80 men, those of which that remained alive.\n\nIn the highest part of the Aguarico River live the indigenous Sioni. The Sioni peoples belong to the western Tucanoan language family, and their official languages are the Piohe (or Pioche) dialects and Spanish as well as a mixture of the two, which is sometimes called Pioche-Sione. At present they are a group of approximately 172 people united in 51 families. Their economic activities are based mainly on hunting, fishing and sometimes tourism. Some of the problems that the community must face in the present era are environmental contamination and the over-exploitation of lumber.\n\n"}

He replaced Gary Holland, who left Dokken to join Dante Fox and later Great White. Before that Brown played drums in The Boyz (1975-1977) and then in Xciter (1977-1981). Both bands also featured future Dokken bandmate George Lynch.\nHe sang vocals on the track \"Tooth and Nail\" on Dokken's live acoustic album, released in 1995, entitled \"One Live Night\".\nApart from Don Dokken, Brown is the only person to appear on every Dokken album. Brown is credited on \"Broken Bones\", but Jimmy Degrasso played on the record, not Brown. In July 2019 Brown said he was taking a break from touring and playing live.\n\nAround 2003 in a conversation with Ted Nugent, former Nugent lighting designer Will Twork mentioned that Brown would be the perfect addition to Nugent's band, after Nugent had heard about Brown from then-bass player Barry Sparks. Twork had worked with Brown on the first Lynch Mob tour, as well as on the 1995 Dokken \"Reunion Tour\" in Japan. \"Mick is an awesome drummer and personality and perfect for Nugent\", said Twork in 2015. In 2006 Brown played drums for Nugent on Nugent's Unleash The Beast Tour, and in 2013 Brown played drums for Nugent on Nugent's Mid-west Rock-n-Roll Express 2013 Tour.\n\nBrown is also a member of T&N (band), a band that features original Dokken members George Lynch and Jeff Pilson.

An infielder (playing over 100 games at all four infield positions in his career), he played nine seasons in Major League Baseball for the Chicago White Sox (1910–13), New York Yankees (1913), Chicago Chi-Feds/Chicago Whales in the Federal League from 1914–15, and lastly the Chicago Cubs (1916–18). He is one of only a few players to play for three different Chicago teams in his career, and one of two to do it in the 20th century. He is the only player to hit home runs for all three Chicago major league teams in the twentieth century. Along with Dutch Zwilling he is the only 20th century player to play in the same city in three different major leagues: American League (White Sox), Federal League (Chi-Feds/Whales), and the National League (Cubs).\n\nStrangely, Zeider contributed to another odd record along with Zwilling. The 1916 Cubs were one of the few teams in history, and the most recent until 1999, to have three players whose last names begin with \"Z\": Zeider, Zwilling, and Heinie Zimmerman. The 1999 Texas Rangers were the first and only since then with Jeff Zimmerman, Todd Zeile, and Gregg Zaun.\n\nHis nickname Bunion was the result of a spike wound when Detroit Tigers outfielder Sam Crawford spiked his \"bunion\" during a play. Zeider's bunion became a news item when he was traded after the injury and his new club, the New York Yankees, later protested that the White Sox had not informed them that Zeider was injured at the time of the trade.\n\nZeider began his professional career in 1905, which he split between the Crookston Crooks and Winnipeg Maroons of the Northern League. In 1909, he played third base for the minor-league San Francisco Seals. On August 17 of that year, Zeider was acquired from the Seals by the White Sox for $5,500 and two players.\n\nThe right-handed Zeider was one of the fastest players in the game, even at the time. With the White Sox, as a rookie, Zeider accomplished what would end up being his career-high in stolen bases with 49, which was also a then modern-day MLB rookie record.\n\nHe reached the top 5 in stolen bases twice (1910, his rookie season, and 1912). Besides those two season, Zeider's early career came as a utility player. Not until 1914 did he begin to play regularly every year. By that point, his speed had decreased, but he still came in eighth in the league in steals with 35 that year (tied with Tom Downey and Baldy Louden). It was also, arguably, his best full season.\n\nIn a nine-season career, he batted .240 with 5 home runs and 253 RBIs in 941 games. He stole 223 bases in his career and scored 393 runs. He had 769 hits in 3210 at bats. In his only World Series appearance (1918 with the Cubs), Zeider had two plate appearances and walked twice.\n\nAfter the 1918 season, Zeider returned to the minor leagues. He played for the Toledo Mud Hens in 1919, and finished his career in 1924 with the Paris North Stars of the class-D East Texas League.\n\nZeider was born in the small town of Hoover near Logansport in Cass County, Indiana, where his father was a farmer, and grew up in Auburn, Indiana, where his father took a job in a sawmill. Zeider was married twice, first to Alberta Doyle, who died of tuberculosis in 1916, then to Margaret Pilgrim.\n\nAfter retiring from professional baseball, he ran a restaurant in Garrett, Indiana, called Polly's Tavern. (\"Polly\" was his local nickname.) He moved to Orland, Indiana, in neighboring Steuben County in 1959. Zeider was inducted into the Northeast Indiana Baseball Association Hall of Fame in 1965.\n\nZeider died in a hospital in Garrett, aged 83, and was interred beside his first wife in Woodlawn Cemetery in Auburn.\n\n\n"}

The Centre includes two public gallery spaces; and as the single largest community of visual artists in Edmonton, it offers 42 low-rent studios for local practicing artists and other non-profit arts related organizations. A unique area of programming to Harcourt House is the Art Enrichment program that serves over 25 local low income and special needs organizations with low/no cost art education classes.\n\nThe WECAN Society (Where Edmonton Community Artist Network) was incorporated in 1987 after forming the \"Artists For Tornado Relief\", a successful art auction organized by Edmonton artists to help victims of the 1987 Edmonton Tornado. Following this event, the energized group of artists devoted their attention into creating a permanent arts centre. In September 1988 the WECAN Society acquired the Harcourt House buildings from the provincial government located at 112th St. and 102 Ave. in downtown Edmonton, where the facility is still located today.\n\nPublic gallery status and charitable status were granted to the organization in 1990. Harcourt House has received its core funding from the Alberta Foundation for the Arts, the City of Edmonton and the Edmonton Arts Council. Additional funding has been obtained from the Clifford E.

{"id": "2033704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033704", "title": "Vrykolakas", "text": "Vrykolakas\n\nVrykolakas (Greek βρυκόλακας, pronounced ), also called vorvolakas or vourdoulakas, is a harmful, undead creature in Greek folklore and in Salento culture (in Salento it is known as \"brucolaco\"). It shares similarities with numerous other legendary creatures, but is generally equated with the vampire of the folklore of the neighbouring Slavic countries. While the two are very similar, \"vrykolakas\" eat flesh, particularly livers, rather than drink blood, bringing it more in line with the modern concept of a zombie.\n\nThe word \"vrykolakas\" is derived from the Slavic word \"vǎrkolak\". The term is attested in other South Slavic languages such as Serbian \"\", ultimately derived from Proto-Slavic \"vьlkolakъ\", see Polish \"wilkołak\", and cognates can be found in other languages such as Lithuanian \"\" and Romanian \"\". The term is a compound word derived from Bulgarian вълк (\"vâlk\")/вук (\"vuk\"), meaning \"wolf\" and \"dlaka\", meaning \"(strand of) hair\" (i.e. having the hair, or fur, of a wolf), and originally meant \"werewolf\" (it still has that meaning in the modern Slavic languages, and a similar one in Romanian). It is also noteworthy that in the eighteenth-century story \"Vrykolokas\" by Pitton de Tournefort, he refers to the revenant as a \"werewolf\" (loups-garous) which may have also been translated as \"bug-bears\", a strange word that has nothing to do with bugs nor bears, but is related to the word \"bogey\", which means spook, spirit, hobgoblin, etc. However, the same word (in the form \"vukodlak\") has come to be used in the sense of \"vampire\" in the folklore of Croatia , Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro (while the term \"vampir\" is more common in Eastern Serbia, and in Bulgaria). Apparently, the two concepts have become mixed. Even in Bulgaria, original folklore generally describes the \"vârkolak\" as a sub-species of the vampire without any wolflike features.\n\nThe Greeks traditionally believed that a person could become a \"vrykolakas\" after death due to a sacrilegious way of life, an excommunication, a burial in unconsecrated ground, or eating the meat of a sheep which had been wounded by a wolf or a werewolf. Some believed that a werewolf itself could become a powerful vampire after being killed, and would retain the wolflike fangs, hairy palms, and glowing eyes it formerly possessed.\n\nThe bodies of \"vrykolakas\" have the same distinctive characteristics as the bodies of vampires in Balkan folklore. They do not decay; instead, they swell and may even attain a \"drumlike\" form, being very large, have a ruddy complexion, and are, according to one account, \"fresh and gorged with new blood\". People with red hair and gray eyes at this time in history were thought to be vampires according to accounts near the region of modern Serbia. The activities of the \"vrykolakas\" are nearly always harmful, ranging from merely leaving their grave and \"roaming about\", through engaging in poltergeist-styled activity, and up to causing epidemics in the community. Among other things, the creature is believed to knock on the doors of houses and call out the name of the residents. If it gets no reply the first time, it will pass without causing any harm. If someone does answer the door, he or she will die a few days later and become another \"vrykolakas\". For this reason, there is a superstition present in certain Greek villages that one should not answer a door until the second knock. Legends also say that the \"vrykolakas\" crushes or suffocates the sleeping by sitting on them, much like a mare or incubus (cf. sleep paralysis) — as does a vampire in Bulgarian folklore. Unlike vampires, in Greek folklore, the \"vrykolakas\" are described more as cannibals than bloodsuckers with a taste in particular for human livers. \n\nSince the \"vrykolakas\" becomes more and more powerful if left alone, legends state that one should destroy its body. According to some accounts, this can only be done on Saturday, which is the only day when the vrykolakas rests in its grave (the same as with Bulgarian vampire legend). This may be done in various ways, the most common being exorcising, impaling, beheading, cutting into pieces, and especially cremating the suspected corpse, so that it may be freed from living death and its victims may be safe.\n\nBelief in the \"vrykolakas\" was still common in Greece in World War II, especially in rural areas. During the Great Famine in 1941-42 where about 300,000 Greeks starved to death, the graveyards were so overfilled that many families were forced to bury their loved ones outside of the cemeteries. So many people starved to death during the Great Famine that officials of the collaborationist Hellenic State took to gathering up the corpses and dumping them in mass graves. Since those buried in unconsecrated ground were believed to come back to haunt the living as \"vrykolakas\", this possibility caused much distress for those families who were unable to bury their dead in the church cemeteries, and some families took preemptive steps to prevent their loved ones from becoming \"vrykolakas\" such as beheading their corpses.\n\nAncient Greeks believed that the dead are able to reanimate and exist in a state that is neither living nor dead, but rather \"undead\". Burials of suspected revenants have been discovered throughout the ancient Greek world. The earliest examples are from Cyprus and date to the Neolithic period (ca. 4500–3900/3800 BCE). At Khirokitia, flexed bodies buried in pit graves were pinned by millstones that were placed on either their heads or chests in order to trap the body in its grave. Similar burials were found at Argolid. In the necropolis of the city of Kamarina, two burials were found which were different from the rest: the first contains an adult of indeterminate sex and stature. The head and feet of the individual are completely covered by large amphora fragments. The heavy amphora fragments found were presumably intended to pin the individual to the grave and prevent it from seeing or rising. The second burial contains a child approximately 8 to 13 years old, also of indeterminate sex and stature. Five large stones were placed on top of the child's body. These stones were used to trap the body in its grave.\n\nIn Attica, a limekiln was found that served as a gravesite for two dismembered individuals. The first body belonged to a woman who was cut horizontally in half, with both halves placed parallel to one another in the prone position. Buried with her was a small jar containing a single coin from the reign of Emperor Constantine and a portion of the dismembered left leg of an adult male. After deposition, the skeletons were deliberately sealed in the limekiln by large rocks.\n\nAt Lesbos, a Turkish cemetery from the Ottoman period contained an isolated tomb of an adult who was pinned at the neck, pelvis and both feet with 20 cm nails. Another burial from the same island dating to the same period contained a man over the age of 60. He was found in a cist grave and had three bent 16 cm spikes mixed in with his bones.\n\nApotropaics are objects or practices that were intended to prevent a recently-deceased loved one from turning into an revenant, or to occupy a revenant sufficiently enough that he will not harm the living. Burying a corpse upside-down was widespread, as was placing earthly objects, such as scythes or sickles, near the grave to satisfy any demons entering the body or to appease the dead so that it would not wish to arise from its coffin. This method resembles the Ancient Greek practice of placing an obolus in the corpse's mouth to pay the toll to cross the River Styx in the underworld; it has been argued that instead, the coin was intended to ward off any evil spirits from entering the body, and this may have influenced later vampire folklore. This tradition persisted in modern Greek folklore about the \"vrykolakas\", in which a wax cross and piece of pottery with the inscription \"Jesus Christ conquers\" were placed on the corpse to prevent the body from becoming a vampire. Other methods commonly practised in Europe included severing the tendons at the knees or placing poppy seeds, millet, or sand on the ground at the grave site of a presumed vampire; this was intended to keep the vampire occupied by counting the fallen grains at the rate of one grain per year, indicating an association of vampires with arithmomania. Similar Chinese narratives state that if a vampiric being came across a sack of rice, it would have to count every grain; this is a theme encountered in myths from the Indian subcontinent, as well as in South American tales of witches and other sorts of evil or mischievous spirits or beings.\n\nThe first Western accounts of belief in \"vrykolakas\" are from the mid-17th century, in compositions by authors such as the Greek librarian of the Vatican Leo Allatius (\"De quorundam Graecorum Opinationibus\", 1645), and Father François Richard (\"Relation de l'Isle de Sant-erini\", 1657), who tend to confirm the stories. The 1718 account of French traveller Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, who witnessed the exhumation and \"slaying\" of a suspected vrykolakas on the Greek island of Mykonos in 1701, became better known. The Greek \"vrykolakas\" was identified as the equivalent of the Slavic vampire during the \"Eighteenth century vampire controversy\", as exemplified in Johann Heinrich Zedler's \"Grosses vollständiges Universal-Lexicon\" (1732–1754). The Spanish scholar Álvaro García Marín wrote in 2016 \"that if we were to judge from the standpoint of a Western European of 1730 or 1820, Dracula without any doubt, should have been Greek...At the beginning of the eighteenth century when the Slavic vampire was still unknown in the West, the Greek \"vyrkolakas\" had been recurring in theological treatises, travel accounts and books on occultism from the beginning of the sixteenth century\".\n\nIt has become normal, in translating vampire movies and the like into Greek, to translate \"vampire\" as \"vrykolakas\". Presumably Modern Greeks raised on Hollywood vampire movies would be just as likely, if not more so, to think of Dracula, instead of the traditional Greek monster, when a \"vrykolakas\" is mentioned.\n\nOne of the few instances of the \"vrykolakas\" or \"vorvolaka\" being used in popular art and media is in the film \"Isle of the Dead\" (1945). Directed by Mark Robson, the film centres around a group of people on a small island, whose lives are threatened by a force that some believe to be the plague, and others believe to be the work of a \"vorvolaka\".\n\nArchaeological excavations on Lesbos at its capital Mytilene have uncovered two vrykolakas burials in early cemeteries. Both were middle-aged men buried in special crypts with 20 cm spikes through the neck, groin and ankles, a typical Balkan method of dealing with a suspected revenant. The British Vice-Consul, Charles Newton, in his \"Travels and Discoveries in the Levant\" mentions an island off the coast of Lesbos on which the Greeks of his time (1850s) buried their vrykolakadhes.\n\nSeveral books and novels has been written by western authors on Vrykolakas, including \"Adventures in Death and Romance: Vrykolakas Tales\", authored by historian Monette Bebow-Reinhard and \"Superposition\" by David Walton (Pyr Books, 2015).\nDimitris Lyacos's postmodern play With the People from the Bridge handles the theme of Vrykolakas in the context of Greek folklore and tradition. Characteristically, the vampiress character is apotropaically handled on a Saturday.\n\n\n"}

It introduced a presidential system and three branches (legislative, administrative and judicial) of government. The KPG inherited the territory of the former Korean Empire. The Korean resisters actively supported and supported the independence movement under the provisional government, and received economic and military support from the Kuomintang of China, the Soviet Union and France.\n\nAfter the surrender of Japan on August 15, 1945, figures such as Kim Gu returned. On August 15, 1948, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was dissolved. Syngman Rhee, who was the first president of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, became the first President of the Republic of Korea in 1948. The current South Korean government claims through the 1987-amended constitution of South Korea that there is continuity between the KPG and the current South Korean state, though this has been criticized by some historians as constituting revisionism.\n\nThe sites of the Provisional Government in Shanghai and Chongqing (Chungking) have been preserved as museums.\n\nThe government was formed on April 11, 1919, shortly after the March 1st movement of the same year during the Imperial Japanese colonial rule of the Korean peninsula.\n\nThe Key members in its establishment included An Changho and Syngman Rhee, both of whom were leaders of the Korean National Association at that time. Changho played an important part in making Shanghai the center of the liberation movement and in getting KPG operations underway. As acting premier, he helped reorganize the government from a parliamentary cabinet system to a presidential system.\n\nThe government resisted the colonial rule of Korea that lasted from 1910 to 1945. They coordinated armed resistance against the Imperial Japanese Army during the 1920s and 1930s, including at the Battle of Chingshanli in October 1920, and the assault on Japanese military leadership in Shanghai's Hongkou Park in April 1932.\n\nThe government resisted the colonial rule of Korea that lasted from 1910 to 1945. They coordinated armed resistance against the Imperial Japanese Army during the 1920s and 1930s, including at the Battle of Bongoh Town in June 1920 and the Battle of Chingshanli in October 1920. Also, they hugely struck a blow the Japanese military leadership in Shanghai's Hongkew Park, April 1932.\n\nThis struggle culminated in the formation of the Korean Volunteer Corps in 1938 and the Korean Liberation Army in 1940, bringing together all Korean resistance groups in exile.\n\nThe government duly declared war against the Axis powers, Japan and Germany, on December 9, 1941, and the Liberation Army took part in allied action in China and parts of Southeast Asia. These efforts received the guarantee of liberated the Korean Peninsula from China, USA and the UK in the Cairo Conference and reaffirmed from USSR, USA and the UK in the Potsdam Conference.\n\nDuring World War II, the Korean Liberation Army was preparing an assault against the Imperial Japanese forces in Korea in conjunction with the American Office of Strategic Services. The government's goal was achieved with the Japanese surrender on September 2, 1945. However, USSR quickly attacked the Japanese force for gained the North part of the Korean Peninsula and this decision made the USA used the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki for gained the early surrender of the Japanese Empire and blocked the USSR attempted strongly influence of Korean Peninsula. On August 15, 1945, the Japanese empire was collapsed and the Korea finally gained the Korean Peninsula. This independence was reaffirmed in the Treaty of San Francisco.\n\nAfter the end of the WWII, US and USSR stationed army forces in Korean Peninsula. USSR already gained the north part of Korean Peninsula in attacked the Japanese empire and they made the Soviet Civil Administration after the end of the WWII. Similary, the US made the United States Army Military Government in south part of Korean Peninsula after the end of the WWII.\n\nThe almost leading members of Korean Provisional Government disagreed the these system of trusteeship to Korean Peninsula.\nMainly, Left side person was Centre-left politician Lyuh Woon-hyung and Right side person was Centre-right politician Kim Kyu-sik. They had each different opinion but disagreed the system of trusteeship and made the movement of collaborate with left and right.\n\nHowever, the US president of Harry S. Truman declared the Truman Doctrine on March, 1947. This doctrine made the accelerated the Cold War and affected the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was founded in 1919 as part of the March 1st Movement. On January 21, 1919, rumors that Emperor Gojong was poisoned by the Japanese imperial family came to light. This culminated in a demonstration that took place at the Emperor's funeral on March 1. Among the 20 million Koreans present, 3.1 million people participated in the demonstration, about 2.20 million, 10% of the total population. There were 7,500 deaths, 16,000 injured, and 46,000 arrested and detained. The protests, which began in March and continued until May, included 33 people who had signed the Declaration of Independence, but were in fact held by the Japanese police.\n\nThe independence movement's popularity grew quickly both locally and abroad. After the March 1, 1919, campaign, a plan was set up at home and abroad to continue expanding the independence movement. However, some were hesitant due to their obedience to the occupying powers. At that time, many independent activists were gathered in Shanghai. Those who set up independent temporary offices repeatedly discussed ways to find new breakthroughs in the independence movement. First, the theory of provisional government was developed, and it was generally argued that the government should organize a government in exile against the Chosun governor's office. However, it was argued that the party was not sufficiently equipped to form a government.\n\nShanghai was a transportation hub and also a center of support for the Guangdong government led by Wu Yuan. In addition, there were delegates from Britain, France, Germany, and the United States, which allowed them to escape the influence of Japan. For this reason, independent offices flocked to Shanghai.\n\nIndependence movements in Shanghai moved more aggressively in the summer of 1919. Seo Byeong-ho, Seung-hyung Cho, Dong-ho Cho, Park Chan-ik, and Sun Woo-hyuk met with the governments from Korea, Manchuria, the Russian Maritime Province and the Americas. Shanghai's independent offices provided accommodation for people from outside the country, centering on the French settlement, and organizing social gatherings for Koreans to create a close network. Around this time, the highly respected independent branch offices of Manchu and the Maritime provinces, such as Dongying, Lee, Shim, Kim DongSam, Shin Chae Ho, Cho Sung Hwan and Chaosang, came to Shanghai and were sent to Korea.\n\nThe Shinhan Youth Party wanted a promise of independence in Korea at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference and dispatched Kim Kyu-sik as a delegate. Since his childhood, he had been studying at the Underwood Academy, where he received a Western education in English, Latin, theology, mathematics, and science. He was multilingual able to speak English, French, German, Russian, Mongolian and Sanskrit as well as Korean, Chinese and Japanese. He delivered the Korean Independence petition to President Woodrow Wilson in the name of the Shinhan Youth Party, and went to Paris, France, in January 1919 to submit a petition in the name of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. However, he was not allowed to attend the Peace Conference because the provisional government had not yet been established. Kim subsequently formed a provisional government to receive the credentials of officially representing the Korean government. Kim's trip to the conference became the motivation for the March 1st Movement and the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea.\n\nBefore his departure, Kim ordered the Shinhan Youth Party members to hold an independent demonstration, saying: \"Even if sent to Paris, Westerners do not know who I am. To expose and propagate Japanese rule, one must declare independence in Korea. The person to be dispatched will be sacrificed, but what happens in Korea will fulfill my mission well.\"\n\nKim Kyu-sik communicated with the Shinhan Youth Party in Paris by radio, and they raised money for the lobbying effort. Inspired by Kim Kyu-sik's arguments, the Shinhan Young Youth Party sent people to Korea and met with national leaders such as Ham Tae-young and Cho Man-sik. Kim Kyu-sik's order for independence demonstrations was the moment when the March 1, 1919 campaign began.\n\nParticipants at the time of the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea were Kim Kyu-sik, representative of the Shinhan Youth Group, Lyuh Woon-Hyung, Kim Cheol, Sun Woo Hyuk, Han Jin Kyo, Chang Deok soo, Cho Dong Ho, Seo Byung Ho and Kim In Jon. There were 30 people including Nam Hyung Woo, Shin Ik-Hee, Yi Si-yeong, Yi Dong-nyeong, Cho Wan Gu, Sin Chaeho, Jo So-ang and Kim Dae Ji. In addition, Kim Gu, Yi Dong-nyeong participated in the establishment, and Ahn Changho, Yi Dong-hwi, and Syngman Rhee were appointed as the Emperor of Shanghai from April to September 1919 and entered Shanghai.\n\nFormer empire personnel also participated in the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. Kim Gajin, who served as an observer of Hwanghae Province and Chungcheongnam-do during the reign of the empire, was a high-ranking official who was defeated in 1910 by the Japanese after being deprived of his country. He formed a secret independent organization called Daedong Dan after the March 1st Movement began in 1919, and served as governor. He was exiled to the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in Shanghai, China in October 1919, and served as a provisional government adviser.\n\nKim Gajin, the fifth son of Emperor Gojong of the Korean Empire and one of the prime candidates for the prince, prepared a plan to escape to the Korean Provisional Government. The Prince Imperial Uihwa sent a letter and indicated his intention to participate in the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. In November 1919, the Prince Imperial Uihwa went to Andong, Manchuria, to escape to the provisional government in Shanghai, but was arrested after being apprehended by the Japanese army and forced to return home. The contents of the book, which was sent to the Provisional Government by the King, were published in an independent newspaper article on November 20, 1919. The current day of historians estimated the Prince Imperial Uihwa had thought of the Korean independence movement and tried to join the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea when he attended the Roanoke College in the US. The reason was Prince Imperial Uihwa's colleague was Kim Kyu-sik and he had a relationship with Kim Kyu-sik in Roanoke College.\n\n\"Main article:\" and \n\nOn April 10, 1919, 1,000 Chinese and Shinhan Youth Party people became the main actors in the \"kimshinburo(Route Pere Robert)\" a French tribe in Shanghai. On April 11, 1919, the National Assembly was established as the Republic of Korea, and the Republic of Korea adopted the Provisional Charter of the Republic of Korea as a democratic republic. After appointing Syngman Rhee as the prime minister in charge of the administration, he appointed six ministers, including Ahn Chang-ho to the ministry of internal affairs, Kim Kyu-sik to the ministry of foreign affairs, Yi Donghwi to the ministry of defense, Yi Si-yeong to the ministry of the law, Moon Chang-bum to the ministry of the traffic and Choi Jae-hyung to the ministry of finance. On November 11, the government announced its establishment. On April 22, 57 representatives of the 2nd Uijeongwon attended and representatives of the eight Korean provinces with representatives of Russia, China, and USA. The chairman was Yi Dongnyeong and vice-chairman was Sohn Jung-do elected in this time. The had the same function as the National Assembly, such as the resolution of bills and the election of a temporary president.\n\nPrior to this, on March 17, 1919, the Provisional Government of the Korean People's Congress was established in the Russian Maritime Province, followed by the establishment of the Hanseong Provisional Government in Kyungsung on April 23. The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in Shanghai raised the issue of integration. Negotiations proceeded between the Korean National Assembly and the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. Won Sehun, who was selected as representative of the National Assembly of Korea, came to Shanghai and negotiated. Both argued that the center of the government should be placed in the area, but that only the departments of the subordinate should be placed on both sides. Despite the two arguments, they were eager to establish a single government as well. Finally, on September 11, 1919, the Korean National Assembly of the Russian Maritime Province and the Hansung Provisional Government of Kyungsung were incorporated into the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in Shanghai, China. As a result, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was able to develop into a single unified government representing various independence movements scattered in Korea, China, and Russia, as well as domestic and foreign Koreans.\n\nIn 1919, when US President Woodrow Wilson advocated for national self-determination, Rhee promoted the League of Nations mandate in the United States, and Kim Kyu-sik pushed for independence under the approval of a victorious country in Paris. The provisional government gained approval from China and Poland through its diplomatic efforts. Meanwhile, in 1944, the government received approval from the Soviet Union. Jo So-ang, the head of the KPG's diplomatic department, met with the French ambassador in Chongqing and was quoted as saying that the French government would give unofficial approval to the government in April 1945. However, the government did not gain formal recognition from the US, UK, and other world powers. In 2019, US Congress was adopted a specify resolution about the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was beginning of founding of Korea.\n\nThe Korean government in exile was established to lead the independence movement on the Korean Peninsula against colonial rule. It was established on April 11, 1919, in Shanghai, China. On September 11 of the same year, it established a single government in Shanghai by integrating temporary governments such as those of Seoul and Russia's Maritime Province.\n\nThe Provisional Constitution was enacted to form the Republic of Korea as a democratic republic. It introduced the presidential system and established separate legislative, administrative and judicial branches. It succeeded the territory of the Korean Empire. Interim president Rhee was impeached and succeeded by Kim Gu. Under the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, he actively supported the independence movement, including the organization of the Korean Liberation Army, and received economic and military support from the Chinese Nationalists, the Soviet Union, France, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nAfter the liberation on August 15, 1945, temporary government factors such as Kim Gu returned to Korea. On August 15, 1948, the Korean exile government and the KPG were dissolved. Rhee, who was the first president of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, became the first President of the Republic of Korea in 1948. The current South Korean government through the national constitution revised in 1987 states that the South Korean people inherited the rule of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, though this has been criticized by some historians as constituting revisionism.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2033735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033735", "title": "Brassica juncea", "text": "Brassica juncea\n\nBrassica juncea, commonly brown mustard, Chinese mustard, Indian mustard, leaf mustard, Oriental mustard and vegetable mustard, is a species of mustard plant.\n\n\"Brassica juncea\" cultivars can be divided into four major subgroups: integrifolia, juncea, napiformis, and tsatsai.\n\nIn 100 grams, cooked mustard greens provide 26 calories and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value) of vitamins A, C, and K which is especially high as a multiple of its Daily Value. Mustard greens are a moderate source of vitamin E and calcium. Greens are 92% water, 4.5% carbohydrates, 2.6% protein and 0.5% fat (table).\n\nThe leaves, seeds, and stems of this mustard variety are edible. The plant appears in some form in African, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Italian, Indian, Japanese, Nepali, Pakistani, Korean, and African-American (soul food) cuisines. Cultivars of \"B. juncea\" are grown for their greens, and for the production of oilseed. The mustard condiment made from the seeds of the \"B. juncea\" is called brown mustard and is considered to be spicier than yellow mustard.\n\nBecause it may contain erucic acid, a potential toxin, mustard oil is restricted from import as a vegetable oil into the United States. Essential oil of mustard, however, is accepted as GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe). But in Russia, this is the main species grown for the production of mustard oil. It is widely used in canning, baking and margarine production in Russia, and the majority of Russian table mustard is also made from \"B. juncea\".\n\nThe leaves are used in African cooking, and all plant parts are used in Nepali cuisine, particularly in the mountain regions of Nepal, as well as in the Punjabi cuisine in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, where a dish called \"sarson da saag\" (mustard greens) is prepared. \"B. juncea\" subsp. \"tatsai\", which has a particularly thick stem, is used to make the Nepali pickle called \"achar\", and the Chinese pickle \"zha cai\".\n\nThe Gorkhas of the Indian states of Darjeeling, West Bengal and Sikkim as well as Nepal prepare pork with mustard greens (also called \"rayo\" in Nepali). It is usually eaten with relish and steamed rice, but can also be eaten with \"roti\" (griddle breads). In Nepal it is also a common practice to cook these greens with meat of all sorts specially goat meat; which is normally prepared in a pressure cooker with minimal use of spices to focus on the flavour of the greens and dry chillies. \"Brassica juncea\" (especially the seeds) is more pungent than greens from the closely related \"Brassica oleracea\" (kale, broccoli, and collard greens), and is frequently mixed with these milder greens in a dish of \"mixed greens\".\n\nChinese and Japanese cuisines also make use of mustard greens. In Japanese cuisine, it is known as \"takana\" and often pickled for use as filling in onigiri or as a condiment. Many varieties of \"B. juncea\" cultivars are used, including \"zha cai\", \"mizuna\", \"takana\" (var. \"integrifolia\"), \"juk gai choy\", and \"xuelihong\". Asian mustard greens are most often stir-fried or pickled. A Southeast Asian dish called \"asam gai choy\" or \"kiam chai boey\" is often made with leftovers from a large meal. It involves stewing mustard greens with tamarind, dried chillies and leftover meat on the bone. Brassica juncea is also known as \"gai choi\", \"siu gai choi\", \"xaio jie cai\", baby mustard, Chinese leaf mustard or \"mostaza\".\n\nVegetable growers sometimes grow mustard as a green manure. Its main purpose is to act as a mulch, covering the soil to suppress weeds between crops. If grown as a green manure, the mustard plants are cut down at the base when sufficiently grown, and left to wither on the surface, continuing to act as a mulch until the next crop is due for sowing, when the mustard is dug in. In the UK, mustard sown in summer and autumn is cut down starting in October. April sowings can be cut down in June, keeping the ground clear for summer-sown crops. One of the disadvantages of using mustard as a green manure is its propensity to harbor club root.\n\nThis mustard plant is used in phytoremediation to remove heavy metals, such as lead, from the soil in hazardous waste sites because it has a higher tolerance for these substances and stores the heavy metals in its cells. In particular, \"Brassica juncea\" was particularly effective at removing cadmium from soil. The process of removing heavy metals ends when the plant is harvested and properly discarded. Phytoremediation has been shown to be cheaper and easier than traditional methods for heavy metal reduction in soils. In addition, it has the effect of reducing soil erosion, reducing cross-site contamination.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2033738", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033738", "title": "Sleep Dirt", "text": "Sleep Dirt\n\nSleep Dirt is an album by Frank Zappa released in January 1979, on his own DiscReet Records label. It reached #175 on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart in the United States.\n\nThe album's creation was spurred by Warner Bros.' rejection of Zappa's \"Läther\" album. After Warner had demanded more albums than Zappa was contractually obliged to provide and had reedited the live album \"Zappa in New York\", a lawsuit ensued, during which \"Studio Tan\", \"Sleep Dirt\" and \"Orchestral Favorites\" were issued without Zappa's permission.\n\nIn early 1976, Zappa's relationship with manager and business partner Herb Cohen ended in litigation. Zappa and Cohen's company DiscReet Records was distributed by Warner Bros. Records. When Zappa asked for a reassignment of his contract from DiscReet to Warner in order to advance the possibility of doing special projects without Cohen's involvement, Warner briefly agreed. This led to the 1976 release of \"Zoot Allures\" on Warner. Early in 1977, Zappa delivered the master tapes for a quadruple-LP set, entitled \"Läther\". However, Warner changed its position following legal action from Cohen, and refused to release the album, claiming that Zappa was contractually bound to deliver four more albums to Warner for the DiscReet label.\n\nDuring 1977, Zappa created the individual albums \"Zappa In New York\", \"Studio Tan\", \"Sleep Dirt\" and \"Orchestral Favorites\" by re-editing recordings from same batch of tapes that made up the 4-LP configuration. After Warner Bros. released \"Zappa In New York\", they told him that he still owed them four more albums. He then attempted to get a distribution deal with Phonogram Inc. to release \"Läther\" on the new Zappa Records label. This led Warner to threaten legal action, preventing the release of \"Läther\" and forcing Zappa to shelve the project. In 1978 and 1979, Warner finally decided to release the three remaining individual albums they still held, \"Studio Tan\", \"Sleep Dirt\" and \"Orchestral Favorites\". As Zappa had delivered the tapes only, these three individual albums were released with no musical credits. Warner also commissioned sleeve art by Gary Panter, which was not approved by Zappa. When this material was first released on CD in 1991, Zappa chose to release the individual albums (along with the Panter artwork). Much of the material on \"Sleep Dirt\" was made available to the public again in a different form when the alternate version of \"Läther\" was finally officially released posthumously in 1996.\n\nFive of the album's seven tracks were intended for the shelved album \"Läther\". \"Flambay\" and \"The Ocean Is the Ultimate Solution\" originally appeared in significantly shortened versions, but are presented in their original edits on the released \"Sleep Dirt\". Zappa's intended title for the album was Hot Rats III. The change in title by Warner was also in violation of Zappa's contract. When Zappa re-issued the recordings he did not change the title. The 1979 LP version of \"Sleep Dirt\" was entirely instrumental. However, with the CD release in 1991, Zappa added new overdubs to the recordings.\n\nZappa asked singer Thana Harris to add vocals to three songs. Zappa had originally envisioned \"Flambay\", \"Spider of Destiny\", and \"Time is Money\" as part of his abandoned 1972 musical, \"Hunchentoot\", and thus, these songs were originally intended to be sung.\n\nChad Wackerman also overdubbed drums on \"Flambay\", \"Spider of Destiny\" and \"Regyptian Strut\". Wackerman's parts replaced the original drum tracks. The first Barking Pumpkin CDs retained the original version of \"Regyptian Strut\", but this was changed for later releases. Both versions of the track can now be found on the \"Läther\" CD. Wackerman did not overdub drums on \"Time is Money\" even though he is credited for this in the CD notes. The 2012 Universal Music reissue reverts to the original vinyl version of the album.\n\nThe creature shown on the cover is Hedorah from the 1971 Toho film \"Godzilla vs. Hedorah\".\n\nAll songs written, composed and arranged by Frank Zappa.\n\n\nAlbum - \"Billboard\" (United States)\n"}

{"id": "2033759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033759", "title": "Remix culture", "text": "Remix culture\n\nRemix culture, sometimes read-write culture, is a society that allows and encourages derivative works by combining or editing existing materials to produce a new creative work or product. A remix culture would be, by default, permissive of efforts to improve upon, change, integrate, or otherwise remix the work of copyright holders. While combining elements has always been a common practice of artists of all domains throughout human history, the growth of exclusive copyright restrictions in the last several decades limits this practice more and more by the legal chilling effect. In reaction, Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig who considers remixing a desirable concept for human creativity has worked since the early 2000s on a transfer of the remixing concept into the digital age. Lessig founded the Creative Commons in 2001 which released Licenses as tools to enable remix culture again, as remixing is legally prevented by the default exclusive copyright regime applied currently on intellectual property. The remix culture for cultural works is related to and inspired by the earlier Free and open-source software for software movement, which encourages the reuse and remixing of software works.\n\nLawrence Lessig described the Remix culture in his 2008 book \"Remix\". Lawrence compared the default media culture of the 20th century to the usage of computer technology terminology as Read/Write culture (RW) vs. Read Only culture (RO).\n\nIn the usual \"Read Only\" media culture, the culture is consumed more or less passively. The information or product is provided by a 'professional' source, the content industry, that possesses an authority on that particular product/information. There is a one-way flow only of creative content and ideas due to a clear role separation between content producer and content consumer. The emergence of Analog mass production and duplication technologies (pre-Digital revolution and internet like radio broad-casting) inherently enabled the RO culture's business model of production and distribution and limited the role of the consumer to consumption of media.\n\nDigital technology does not have the 'natural' constraints of the analog that preceded it. RO culture had to be recoded in order to compete with the \"free\" distribution made possible by the Internet. This is primarily done in the form of Digital Rights Management (DRM), which imposes largely arbitrary restrictions on usage. Regardless, DRM has proven largely ineffective in enforcing the constraints of analog media.\n\n\"Read/Write culture\" has a reciprocal relationship between the producer and the consumer. Taking works, such as songs, and appropriating them in private circles is exemplary of RW culture, which was considered to be the 'popular' culture before the advent of reproduction technologies. The technologies and copyright laws that soon followed, however, changed the dynamics of popular culture. As it became professionalized, people were taught to defer production to the professionals.\n\nDigital technologies provide the tools for reviving RW culture and democratizing production, sometimes referred to as Web 2.0. Blogs explain the three layers of this democratization. Blogs have redefined our relationship to the content industry as they allowed access to non-professional, user-generated content. The 'comments' feature that soon followed provided a space for readers to have a dialogue with the amateur contributors. 'Tagging' of the blogs by users based on the content provided the necessary layer for users to filter the sea of content according to their interest. The third layer added bots that analyzed the relationship between various websites by counting the clicks between them and, thus, organizing a database of preferences. The three layers working together established an ecosystem of reputation that served to guide users through the blogosphere. While there is no doubt many amateur online publications cannot compete with the validity of professional sources, the democratization of digital RW culture and the ecosystem of reputation provides a space for many talented voices to be heard that was not available in the pre-digital RO model.\n\nFor remix culture to survive, it must be shared and created by others. This is where participatory culture comes into play, because consumers start participating by becoming contributors, especially the many teens growing up with these media cultures. A book was published in 2013 by Henry Jenkins called \"Reading in a Participatory Culture\" which focuses on his technique of remixing the original story \"Moby-Dick\" to make it a new and fresh experience for students. This form of teaching enforces the correlation between participatory and remix culture while highlighting its importance in evolving literature. Since media culture consumers start to look at art and content as something that can be repurposed or recreated therefore making them the producer.\n\nRemix culture has created an environment that is nearly impossible for artists to have or own \"original work\". Media and the internet have made art so public that it leaves the work up for other interpretation and, in return, remixing. A major example of this in the 21st century is the idea of memes. Once one is put into cyberspace it is automatically assumed that someone else can come along and remix the picture. For example, the 1964 self-portrait created by artist Rene Magritte, \"Le Fils De L'Homme\", was remixed and recreated by street artist Ron English in his piece \"Stereo Magritte\".\n\nAn exemption exists for disability service technology to change copyrighted media to make it accessible to them. The American Foundation of the Blind (AFB), American Council of the Blind (ACB) and Samuelson-Glushko Technology Law & Policy Clinic (TLPC) work with U.S. Copyright Office, Library of Congress to renew the exemptions that allow the visually impaired to convert visual texts in copyrighted work into e-readers and other forms of technology that make it possible for them to access. So long as the copyrighted material is obtained in the legal way, the exemption allows for it to be remixed to help to be accessible to anyone disabled. This exemption extends broadly, including transcribing public broadcasts such as television or radio to be transcribed to braille or visual text if need be. With the proper license, obtained by anyone with a disability that can limit perception, copyrighted material that is obtained legally can be remixed for their understanding. . It has last been renewed in 2012 and continues to stand. \n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware as digital good is well suited for adaption and remixing.\n\n\nIn film, remixing is often done and happens in many forms. \n\nGIFs are another example of remix culture. They are illustrations and small clips from films used for personal expressions in online conversations. GIFs are commonly taken from an online video form such as film, T.V. or YouTube videos. Each clip usually lasts for about 3 seconds and is \"looped, extended and repeated.\" GIFs take a mass media sample and reimagines, or remixes, its meaning from the original context to use it as a form of personal expression in a different context. They are used throughout various media platforms but are most popular in Tumblr where they are used to articulate a punch line.\n\nThroughout history remix culture has been truthful not only in exchange of oral stories but also through the Bible. Eugene H. Peterson reinterpreted bible stories in his 2002 book \"The Message// Remix\" which makes the bible more simple for readers to interpret. An idea of remixing dated back to the Quakers who would interpret the scripture and create a biblical narrative by using their own voices, which went against the \"read-only\" practice that was more common.\n\nRemixing was always a part of the human culture. US media scholar Professor Henry Jenkins argued that \"“the story of American arts in the 19th century might be told in terms of the mixing, matching and merging of folk traditions taken from various indigenous and immigrant populations.”\" Another historical example of remixing is Cento, a literary genre popular in Medieval Europe consisting mainly of verses or extracts directly borrowed from the works of other authors and arranged in a new form or order.\n\nThe balance between creation and consumption shifted with the technological progress on media recording and reproduction. Notable events are the invention of book printing press and the analog Sound recording and reproduction leading to severe cultural and legal changes.\n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, on the dawn of the analog Sound recording and reproduction revolution, John Philip Sousa, an American composer and conductor of the late Romantic era, warned in 1906 in a congressional hearing on a negative change of the musical culture by the now available \"canned music\". \n\nSpecialized, expensive creation devices (\"read-write\") and specialized cheap consumption (\"read-only\") devices allowed a centralized production by few and decentralized consumption by many. Analog devices for consumers for low prices, lacking the capability of writing and creating, spread out fast: Newspapers, Jukebox, radio, television. This new business model, an Industrial information economy, demanded and resulted in the strengthening of the exclusive copyright and a weakening of the remix culture and the Public domain in throughout the 19th and 20th century.\n\nAnalog creation devices were expensive and also limited in their editing and rearranging capability. An analog copy of a work (e.g. an audio tape) cannot be edited, copied and worked on infinite often as the quality continuously worsens. Despite that, a creative remixing culture survived to some limited degree. For instance composer John Oswald coined in 1985 the Plunderphonics term in his essay \"Plunderphonics, or Audio Piracy as a Compositional Prerogative\" for sound collages based on existing audio recordings and altering them in some way to make a new composition.\n\nTechnology changed fundamentally with the digital revolution. Digital information could be reproduced and edited infinitely, often without quality loss. Still, in the 1960s the first digital general computing devices with such capabilities were meant only for specialists and professionals and were extremely expensive; the first consumer oriented devices like video game consoles inherently lacked RW capability. But in the 1980s, the arrival of the home computer and especially the IBM personal computer brought a digital prosumer device, a device usable for production and consumption at the same time, to the masses for an affordable price. Similarly for software, in the 1990s the free and open-source software movement implemented a software ecosystem based on the idea of edit-ability by anyone.\n\nThe arrival of the Internet in the late 1990s and early 2000s created a highly effective way to re-implement a \"remix culture\" in all domains of art, technology and society. Unlike TV and radio, with a unidirectional information transport (producer to consumer), the Internet is inherently bidirectional, enabling a peer-to-peer dynamic. This accelerated with Web 2.0 and more user-generated content due to Commons-based peer production possibilities. Remixes of songs, videos, and photos are easily distributed and created. There is a constant revision to what is being created, which is done on both a professional and amateur scale. The availability of various end-user oriented software such as GarageBand and Adobe Photoshop makes it easy to remix. The Internet allows distribution of remixes to the masses. Internet memes are Internet-specific creative content which are created, filtered and transformed by the viral spreading process made possible by the web and its users.\n\nAs a response to a more restrictive copyright system (Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension, DMCA), which started to limit the blooming sharing and remixing activities of the web, Lawrence Lessig founded the Creative Commons in 2001. In 2002 the Creative Commons released a set of licenses as tools to enable remix culture, by allowing a balanced, fair enabling release of creative works, \"some rights reserved\" instead of the usual \"all rights reserved\". Several companies and governmental organizations adapted this approach and licenses in the following years, for instance flickr, DeviantART and Europeana using or offering CC license options which allow remixing. There are several webpages addressing this remix culture, for instance ccMixter founded 2004.\n\nThe 2008 open-source film by Brett Gaylor \"\" documents \"the changing concept of copyright\". \n\nIn 2012 Canada's Copyright Modernization Act explicitly added a new exemption which allows non-commercial remixing.\nIn 2013 the US court ruling Lenz v. Universal Music Corp. acknowledged that amateur remixing might fall under fair use and copyright holders are requested to check and respect fair use before doing DMCA take down notices.\n\nUnder copyright laws of many countries, anyone with the intent to remix an existing work is liable for lawsuit because the laws protect the intellectual property of the work. However, current copyright laws are proving to be ineffective at preventing sampling of content. On the other hand, fair-use does not address a wide enough range of use-cases and its borders are not well established and defined, making usage under \"fair use\" legally risky. Lessig argues that there needs to be a change in the current state of copyright laws to legalize remix culture, especially for fair-use cases. He states that \"outdated copyright laws have turned our children into criminals.\" One proposition is to adopt the system of citation used with book references. The artist would cite the intellectual property she sampled which would give the original creator the credit, as is common with literature references. As tools for doing so Lawrence Lessig proposed the Creative Commons licenses which demand for instance Attribution without restricting the general use of a creative work. One step further is the Free content movement, which proposes that creative content should be released under free licenses. The Copyright reform movement tries to tackle the problem by cutting for instance the excessively long copyright terms, as it was debated by scholar Rufus Pollock.\n\nOther copyright scholars, such as Yochai Benkler and Erez Reuveni, promulgate ideas that are closely related to remix culture. Some scholars argue that the academic and legal institutions must change with the culture towards one that is remix-based.\n\nIn February 2010 Cato Institute's Julian Sanchez praised the remix activities for its social value, \"\"for performing social realities\"\" and remarked that copyright should be evaluated regarding the \"\"level of control permitted to be exercised over our social realities\"\".\nAccording to Kirby Ferguson in 2011 and his popular TED talk series, everything is a remix, and that all original material builds off of and remixes previously existing material. He argues if all intellectual property is influenced by other pieces of work, copyright laws would be unnecessary. Ferguson described that, the three key elements of creativity — copy, transform, and combine — are the building blocks of all original ideas; building on Pablo Picasso's famous quote \"Good artists copy, great artists steal.\".\n\nIn June 2015 a WIPO article named \"\"Remix Culture and Amateur Creativity: A Copyright Dilemma\"\" acknowledged the \"age of remixing\" and the need for a copyright reform.\n\nBut the culture is not without its critics even going so far in accusations of plagiarism. \n\nIn his 2006 book \"Cult of the Amateur\".\", Web 2.0 critic Andrew Keen criticizes Free and Read-Write Culture.\n\nIn 2011 UC Davis professor Thomas W. Joo criticized remix culture for romanticizing free culture while Terry Hart had a similar line of criticism in 2012.\n\n\n"}

Skinner mostly has managed at the minor-league level, save for one half of one season at the helm of the Cleveland Indians. He is the son of Bob Skinner, a National League outfielder in the 1950s and 1960s, and himself a former MLB coach and skipper.\n\nIn , Skinner became the manager of the Rochester Red Wings, the Triple-A affiliate of the Minnesota Twins. He was reported to have been replaced by Toby Gardenhire for the 2020 season.\n\nAt Mission Bay High School in San Diego, Joel Skinner played baseball and water polo. He was drafted immediately following his senior year and was the first player taken in the free-agent compensation draft.\n\nOriginally drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates, Skinner was traded to the Chicago White Sox in 1983. After brief call-ups to the majors over the next three years, Skinner was slated to start 1986 with the White Sox.\n\nNew general manager Hawk Harrelson had taken a liking to Skinner, and decided to make him the starting catcher in place of Carlton Fisk. This made some sense on paper; Fisk was 38 years old, and conventional wisdom then as now held that catchers at that age don't have many years left. Harrelson wanted to have Fisk's successor in place when Fisk retired. To ease the transition, Fisk was moved to left field. The move backfired when Skinner batted only .171 in April. On May 10, Fisk became the regular catcher, and Skinner only made 25 more starts behind the plate before being traded to the New York Yankees on July 30.\n\nSkinner's career never really recovered after that. He bounced between the majors and minors with the Yankees and Cleveland Indians until his retirement in 1994.\n\nSkinner spent six seasons managing in the Indians minor league system from 1995–2000. Overall, he compiled a record of 448–333 (.574) and took his teams to the playoffs in five of six seasons. In 1995 Skinner managed the Watertown Indians to a record of 46- 27 and a New York–Penn League title, and received Manager of the Year honors. With the Columbus Redstixx (South Atlantic League) in 1996, he managed them to a second half title and a regular season record of 79–63. In 1997Skinner managed the Class A Kinston Indians (Carolina League) as they won titles in both the first and second halves with an 87–53 record overall, earning him Carolina League Manager of the Year honors. From 1998 through 1999 Skinner managed the Akron Aeros and was named \"USA Today Baseball Weekly's\" Minor League Manager of the Year in 1998, after guiding the Aeros to an 81–60 record and an Eastern League regular season title. Skinner then managed the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons to the best record in the International League in 2000, including an IL North Division title with a record of 86–59 (.593). His leadership of the Bisons in earned him Minor League Manager of the Year honors from \"Baseball America\" and \"The Sporting News\" in addition to being given International League Manager of the Year honors. That same season Skinner was a coach for Team USA in the 2000 All-Star Futures Game in Atlanta. \n\nIn 2011 Skinner was hired as the manager of the Charlotte Knights, the White Sox Triple-A affiliate, for the 2012 season. \n\nIn 2016, Skinner was the manager of the Winston-Salem Dash of the Carolina League.\n\nOn January 17, 2018, former MLB catcher, coach and manager Joel Skinner was named as the 45th manager of the Rochester Red Wings, the Triple-A affiliate of the Minnesota Twins, of the International League.\n\nSkinner was named to the coaching staff of the Cleveland Indians on November 10, 2000, succeeding Jim Riggleman as third base coach. He was named interim manager of the Tribe on July 11, 2002 after Charlie Manuel was let go in a contract dispute. At the time, Skinner was the youngest manager in the major leagues, at age 41. He skippered the team to a 35–41 record to finish the season, including a 15–13 record in September. Skinner's name was mentioned among candidates to the permanent manager's job, but Eric Wedge was chosen instead. Skinner remained on the Indians' coaching staff until Manny Acta was hired in 2009. On October 20, 2010, Skinner was hired as the Oakland Athletics bench coach for the 2011 season replacing Tye Waller. On November 14, 2011, Skinner was hired as the manager of the Charlotte Knights.\n\n\n"}

It aired on YTV in Canada and on Discovery Kids and MeTV in the United States. It was also dubbed in Japanese and aired in Japan on NHK.\n\nTeenage hosts Araya and Christina investigate paranormal or global historical reports of mysteries such as legendary creatures/monsters, disembodied spirits, dinosaurs and aliens/unidentified flying objects. They use scientific rigour to try to find plausible explanations for the sightings and eye-witness accounts that trigger their investigations. In another section of the show, Doubting Dave, a scientist played by David Acer, attempts to explain mysterious personal experiences that have been emailed in by viewers, in a feature called \"V-Files\", as well as a way to create your own versions of the mysteries in the show in his \"Mystery Lab\" segment.\n\nProduced by Apartment 11 Productions, four seasons and 78 episodes of the series have been made, and it has garnered awards and accolades from around the world, including eight Gemini Award nominations, a 2006 Parents' Choice Award, and a 2007 Japan Prize (sponsored by the Japanese television network NHK) for the \"Stonehenge\" episode, awarded the Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications Prize in the Early Education category.\n\nThe program begins with a question that introduces the two investigations of the week, leading into the opening title sequence. Then follows part one of each of the two stories with Araya and Christina each featured in one. Then the \"V-File\"; Doubting Dave answers a viewer's question about some mysterious occurrence.

{"id": "2033771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033771", "title": "Zaruma", "text": "Zaruma\n\nZaruma, officially Villa Real de San Antonio del Cerro de Oro de Zaruma is a town in the south of Ecuador, El Oro Province. It is located in the south-east of this province, at an altitude of 1200 metres above sea level, on an inter-Andes route where the Vizcaya mountain range branches off from the Chilla mountain range. It is the seat of Zaruma Canton, one of the oldest cantons in the province.\n\nZaruma is known for its republic-era architecture, gold mines, culture and traditions, art and coffee and for having been founded by Spanish explorer Alonso de Mercadillo. These attributes have led to its receiving various titles celebrating both its tangible and intangible aspects, and in 1998 the Ecuadorian Institute for Cultural Heritage submitted it as a candidate UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nThe word Zaruma is formed from two quichua words: \"sara\", which means corn, and \"uma\", which means head. That is to say, Zaruma to translates to \"corn head\", a name attributed to the existing corn and to the gold mined here, which is similar in colour to a corncob. It is not known why the spelling was altered from \"Saruma\" to \"Zaruma\". However, historian Jorge Núñez claims that Zaruma means \"small mountain peak\".\n\n It is believed that one of the few states existing among early settlers was Zarzas, which contained eleven tribes: the Cariamangas, Catacochas, Catamayus, Gonzanamaes, Guachanamaes, Malacatos, Piscobambas, Vilcabambas, Yanganas and Zarumas.\n\nIt is believed that the Cañari settled in what is now Zaruma canton between 500 and 1400 CE. This is supported by the existence of important archeological sites such as Guayquichuma, Chepel, Payama, Trencilla, San Antonio, Chiva Turco, Tocto Shuqin, Guartiguro, among others, all of which have been attributed to the Cañari.\n\nIn the 1480s, the Cañari settled in Zaruma were overpowered by the Incas who were then under the command of Huayna Capac. After ordering his subordinates to explore the north, they invaded the Zaruma basin, enslaving the indigenous Cañari for 50 years.\n\nThe Inca, now settled in Zaruma, felt compelled to contribute to the ransom of Atahualpa when he was taken prisoner by the Spanish. In 1533, their chief Quinará decided to take a lot of gold in order to pay this ransom. Records say that he crossed the river Pisco Bamba, Catamayo Canton, but on learning of Atahualpa's execution he buried the gold in deep galleries close to the Guatuchi Hacienda in Loja Province.\n\nIn 1549, the first Spanish towns were established in this region by the Spanish caudillo Alonso de Mercadillo. Zaruma became very important because of its rich gold deposits, for which reason Philip II of Spain granted it the title of \"Villa de Sant Antonio del Zerro de Oro de Zaruma\" (Villa Real de San Antonio del Cerro de Oro de Zaruma on October 17, 1593.\n\nOn 8 December 1595, Captain Damián Meneses (under the orders of García Hurtado de Mendoza, Viceroy of Peru) fulfilled the royal edict and definitively founded Zaruma. This foundation had much significance for the area, including the loss of its cultural identity due to the imposition of a dominant culture, as well as the formation of rigid structures of injustice against indigenous rights. \n\nOn 20 January 1749, the city and the majority of its mines were destroyed by an earthquake. To the misfortune of the Spanish, a large indigenous rebellion erupted and resulted in a mass exodus and the ruin of the city. After this, Zaruma entered into a deep economic depression, but with the efforts of some miners and official aid from the Crown allowed the importation of native peoples to work in the mines, which allowed the improvement of the city's circumstances. Research suggests that between 1536 and 1820, Spain benefited from approximately 2,700 tonnes of Zaruman gold.\n\nOn 26 November 1820, Zaruma declared its independence from Spain. Following the examples of Quito, Guayaquil and Cuenca, a group of Zaruman patriots supported by Cuencan intellectuals declared their independence despite the fierce opposition of the government of Loja. The architects of its freedom were Fray Justo Gaona and Francisco Barnuevo, together with Ambrosio Maldonado, Bonifacio de los Reyes, Antonio Barzallo, José María Gálvez and José Gusmán y Román, citizens who signed a document at the Loja council house, now considered as its independence act. \n\nAfter independence, the area fell into a state of deep depression. However, its mining industry never completely disappeared.\n\nOn 25 June 1824, Zaruma was raised to the level of canton according to the Colombian territorial division law, which named it as part of the province of Loja, department of Azuay. The Liberator Simón Bolivar, trying to reenergise mining production and find resources for administering the state, passed the Mining Laws in 1829 and named Sr Manuel Astudillo Samaniego as the Mining Magistrate for this canton.\n\nThe newly formed state invited technicians and businesses from throughout the world to invest in mining, especially in Zaruma. In 1862, García Moreno created a tax on mining in order to benefit Zaruma municipality. In 1876, Ignacio de Veintimilla hired the German geologist Teodoro Wolf to study Zaruma's mines. Later, in 1860, the Great Zaruma Gold Mining Company Limited was formed with the help of English investments and a total capital of £250,000.\n\nOn 29 November 1882, Zaruma, Machala and Santa Rosa provinces declared the creation of a new province named El Oro, in honour of the region's gold, of which Zaruma was capital until 1884. On 23 April 1884, with the New Law of Territorial Division, the province was recognised but with its capital in Machala.\n\nIt has been widely reported for many years that Zaruma and its neighboring city Loja, Ecuador has been a safe-haven place for Crypto-Jews. \nEvidence includes customs and a Ladino dialect. \n\nIn December 2013, Israeli Ambassador Eliyahu Yerushalmi officially visited the governor of El Oro, hosting several councillors in the presence of the mayor Danilo Astudillo Mora, the main local authorities, representatives of institutions, schools and student delegations symbolically handing over the keys of the city. The mayor also announced that this would establish some points of cooperation that would affect the development of the region. Jose Reyes Aguilar, head of the University of Quevedo, also presented some views on the reality of the livestock sector and the future agreements established with Israel. The Israeli Ambassador took the floor to congratulate the authorities and its people for preserving a wonderful, pleasant and unique city, which identifies its Sephardic descent, and offered to build international relations in the areas of technology and education.\n\nIn 1990, the Ecuadorian Ministry for Education and Culture declared Zaruma as an Ecuatorian Cultural Heritage site. Since 1998, Zaruma has been on Unesco's list of candidates for World Heritage Site.\n\n"}

It was removed from FreeBSD and OpenBSD; the NetBSD implementation was nonfunctional until work leading up the 4.0 release made it viable again as a production file system.\n\nMost of the on-disk format of LFS is borrowed from UFS. The indirect block, inode and directory formats are almost identical. This allows well-tested UFS file system code to be re-used; current implementations of LFS share the higher-level UFS code with the lower-level code for FFS, since both of these file systems share much in common with UFS.\n\nLFS divides the disk into \"segments\", only one of which is active at any one time. Each segment has a header called a \"summary block\". Each summary block contains a pointer to the next summary block, linking segments into one long chain that LFS treats as a linear log. The segments do not necessarily have to be adjacent to each other on disk; for this reason, larger segment sizes (between 384KB and 1MB) are recommended because they amortize the cost of seeking between segments.\n\nWhenever a file or directory is changed, LFS writes to the head of this log:\n\nUnlike UFS, inodes in LFS do not have fixed locations. An inode map—a flat list of inode block locations—is used to track them. As with everything else, inode map blocks are also written to the log when they are changed.\n\nWhen a segment is filled, LFS goes on to fill the next free or \"clean\" segment. Segments are said to be \"dirty\" if they contain \"live\" blocks, or blocks for which no newer copies exist further ahead in the log. The LFS \"garbage collector\" turns dirty segments into \"clean\" ones by copying live blocks from the dirty segment into the current segment and skipping the rest. The summary block in each segment contains a map to track live blocks.\n\nGenerally, garbage collection is delayed until there are no clean segments left; it can also be deferred for when the system is idle. Even then, only the least-dirty segments are picked for collection. This is intended to avoid the penalty of cleaning full segments when I/O bandwidth is most needed.\n\nAt a \"checkpoint\" (usually scheduled about once every 30 seconds), LFS writes the last known block locations of the inode map and the number of the current segment to a \"checkpoint region\" at a fixed place on disk. There are two such regions; LFS alternates between them each checkpoint. Once written, a \"checkpoint\" represents the last consistent snapshot of the file system. Recovery after a crash and normal mounting work the same way—the file system simply reconstructs its state from the last checkpoint and resumes logging from there.\n\n"}

{"id": "2033787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033787", "title": "Le Nain", "text": "Le Nain\n\nThe three Le Nain brothers were painters in 17th-century France: Antoine Le Nain (c.1600–1648), Louis Le Nain (c.1603–1648), and Mathieu Le Nain (1607–1677). They produced genre works, portraits and portrait miniatures.\n\nThe brothers were born in or near Laon in northern France. Mathieu was born in 1607; Antoine and Louis were originally believed to have been born in 1588 and 1593, respectively, but are now thought to have been born later; the National Gallery gives them birth dates of \"c. 1600? and c. 1603?\". By 1630, all three lived in Paris, where they shared the studio founded by Antoine, who was admitted to the Paris painters' guild, enabling his two brothers to train under him without paying fees. Within a few years they were receiving important commissions, Antoine painting a group portrait of the aldermen of Paris in 1632.\n\nThe early paintings of the Le Nains were religious, and varied in style as the brothers passed through brief periods in which they were influenced by French contemporaries such as Philippe de Champaigne, Laurent de La Hyre, and Jacques Blanchard. A more enduring influence on their paintings of the 1630s, such as \"The Holy Family\" (ca. 1635–1640), was the work of the Italian artist Orazio Gentileschi, who had worked in Paris during the 1620s.\n\nThe Le Nains's interest in genre and peasant subjects began around 1640. In 1648 the three brothers were received into the Académie de peinture et de sculpture on the year of its founding.\n\nBecause of the similarity of their styles of painting and the difficulty of distinguishing works by each brother (they signed their paintings only with their surname, and many may have been collaborations), they are commonly referred to as a single entity, \"Le Nain\". Louis is usually credited with the best-known of their paintings, a series of scenes depicting peasant life; he may have visited Italy, and been influenced by the Dutch artist Pieter van Laer, who was based in Rome but also passed through France in the mid-1620s. These genre paintings are often noted for being remarkably literal, yet sympathetic; the subjects are never grotesque or seem ridiculed. There remains some question, however, as to whether some of the assumed \"peasants\" were truly from the rural class—many seem to be simply the bourgeois at leisure in the country. Their sober execution and choice of colour recall characteristics of the Spanish school. Their choice of subject was unusual for the time: the world of Paris was busy with mythological allegories, and the \"heroic deeds\" of the king, while the three Le Nain devoted themselves chiefly to these subjects of humble life such as \"Peasant Meal\" (1642), \"Boys Playing Cards\", or \"A Farrier in His Forge\", three pictures now in the Louvre. Their \"Adoration of the Shepherds\" in London (National Gallery) is an exception, and many other civic and church works may have been lost in the French Revolution. \"Ariane in Naxos\" also appears to be an exception, as it depicts the Greek deity Bacchus and his lover Ariadne.\n\nThe brothers also produced miniatures (mainly attributed to Antoine) and portraits (attributed to Mathieu). Mathieu became the official painter (\"Peintre Ordinaire\") of Paris in 1633, and much later was made a chevalier. Among his sitters for portraits were Marie de Medici and Cardinal Mazarin, but these works seem to have disappeared.\n\nAntoine and Louis died in 1648. Mathieu lived until 1677, and appears to have painted until the mid-1650s, although no works are signed after 1648. In 1662 he received the unusual honour for a painter of the Order of Saint Michael, but was expelled a year later, and imprisoned in 1662 for wearing the collar of the order when he was not entitled to it.\n\nThe Le Nain paintings had a revival in the 1840s and, thanks to the exertions of Champfleury, made their appearance on the walls of the Louvre in 1848. Champfleury was a friend of the Realist painter Gustave Courbet, and a theorist of Realism and writer on French popular arts. The \"naive\" quality of these works, with their static poses, \"awkward\" compositions and peasant subjects were admired and may well have exercised some influence on many nineteenth-century artists, notably Courbet himself. They have remained popular through the 20th century.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2033844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033844", "title": "William Stringfellow", "text": "William Stringfellow\n\nFrank William Stringfellow (1928–1985) was an American lay theologian, lawyer and social activist. He was active mostly during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nBorn in Johnston, Rhode Island, on April 26, 1928, he grew up in Northampton, Massachusetts, and graduated from Northampton High School in 1945. He managed to obtain several scholarships and entered Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, at the age of fifteen. He later earned a scholarship to the London School of Economics and served in the US 2nd Armored Division. Stringfellow then attended Harvard Law School. After his graduation, he moved to a slum tenement in Harlem, New York City, to work among poor African Americans and Hispanics.\n\nHis career of activism can be traced to his junior year at Bates, when he organized a sit-in at a local Maine restaurant that refused to serve people of color. It was his first foray into social activism, and he never looked back. Just a few years later, Stringfellow gained a reputation as a strident critic of the social, military and economic policies of the US and as a tireless advocate for racial and social justice. That justice, he declared, could be realized only if it were pursued according to a serious understanding of the Bible and the Christian faith. He was particularly active in the Civil Rights Movement and has spoken extensively about civil disobedience through nonviolence and integration, particularly in an interview with Robert Penn Warren for the book \"Who Speaks for the Negro?\".\n\nAs a Christian, he viewed his vocation as a commitment, bestowed upon him in baptism, to a lifelong struggle against the \"powers and principalities\", which he believed systemic evil is sometimes called in the New Testament, or \"Power of Death\". He proclaimed that being a faithful follower of Jesus means to declare oneself free from all spiritual forces of death and destruction and to submit oneself single-heartedly to the power of life. In contrast to most younger liberal Protestant theologians of his time, Stringfellow insisted on the primacy of the Bible for Christians as they undertook such precarious and inherently dangerous work. This placed him not within the camp of evangelicalism, but that of neo-orthodoxy, particularly the part of that school influenced by the Swiss Reformed theologian Karl Barth, who made a rare compliment to Stringfellow on his only visit to the US. Yet others might classify him as a harbinger of the later liberation theology during the 1970s and 1980s. Although, to be clear, Stringfellow himself was ultimately critical of any self-described political theology that would allow itself to function as a closed ideology. During his lifetime, similar ideas to Stringfellow's could be found in the writings of the French critic Jacques Ellul, with whom he had an ongoing correspondence.\n\nHe made pointed criticisms of theological seminaries: those of the liberal Protestant mainline were theologically shallow, their curriculum and ethos a mixture of \"poetic recitations ... social analysis, gimmicks, solicitations, sentimentalities, and corn.\" On the other hand, he considered fundamentalist/orthodox institutions to isolate themselves from modern society; he commented, \"... if they actually took the Bible seriously they would inevitably love the world more readily ... because the Word of God is free and active in the world.\" These conditions were, he felt, symptomatic of the twin errors of acculturated religious liberalism and authoritarian dogmatism, two options American Christians usually chose from in order to achieve the same goal: domesticating the Gospel and thus blunting its transformative impact on both individuals and the state. Instead of concerning himself with the US academic theological scene, Stringfellow sought an audience of law and business students, especially those who opted to embrace Christian beliefs and all the while fully involved themselves in the world.\n\nA lawyer by profession, Stringfellow's chief legal interests pertained to constitutional law and due process. He dealt with both every day in Harlem as he represented victimized tenants, accused persons who would otherwise have inadequate counsel in the courts, and impoverished African Americans who were largely excluded from public services like hospitals and government offices.\n\nThroughout his student days Stringfellow had involved himself in the World Student Christian Federation. He later became deeply immersed in the World Council of Churches, as well as his native denomination, the Episcopal Church (Anglican), where he supported the ordination of women. Stringfellow was also involved with the Sojourners Community in Washington, DC. He also harbored at his Block Island home the Jesuit priest Daniel Berrigan, who went underground after fleeing from federal authorities for acts of civil disobedience.\n\nStringfellow's foremost contribution to theological thought is to see in \"images, ideologies, and institutions\" the primary contemporary manifestations of the demonic powers and principalities often mentioned in the Bible. This outlook made him categorically suspicious of activities of governments, corporations, and other organizations, including the institutional churches, a viewpoint that placed him at odds with the nearly-ubiquitous \"progressive\" sentiments of the mid-20th century. In the mid-1960s, he defended Bishop James Pike against charges of heresy lodged against him by his fellow Episcopal bishops, believing them moved more by politics (i.e., appeasement of the denomination's conservatives such as Southerners and the wealthy) than serious faith.\n\nRecent treatments of his body of work include those by theologian Walter Wink, Bill Wylie-Kellermann and Sharon Delgado, all ordained United Methodist ministers. He has also influenced later Roman Catholics, including John Dear and journalist Nathan Schneider, as well as evangelical social activists, Jim Wallis and Shane Claiborne, and biblical scholar, Wes Howard Brook.\n\nHe had a longtime celibate relationship with the Methodist poet Anthony Towne from the 1960s until Anthony died in 1980. He wrote \"A Simplicity of Faith: My Experience in Mourning\" (1982) afterwards, wherein he identified Anthony as \"my sweet companion for seventeen years.\" He never publicly identified himself as a homosexual, but wrote and spoke on the topic, always denouncing the idolatry of both homophobia (as it is now called) in churches and the \"ostentation\" of gay culture, which he believed too often encouraged assuaging loneliness with lust and promiscuity. He died from diabetes on March 2, 1985. That ailment was a consequence of life-threatening surgery in 1968 which removed his pancreas, and episode recounted in detail in his book \"A Second Birthday\".\n\nSince the 2000–2001 academic year, Bates College annually recognizes a student and a citizen in Maine for their work pursuing peace and justice. The Office of the Chaplain at Bates Colleges gives these awards to individuals who they find have \"courageous and sustained commitment to redressing the systemic, root causes of violence and social injustice.\" \n\n\n"}

{"id": "2033863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033863", "title": "Curtis (Curtis Mayfield album)", "text": "Curtis (Curtis Mayfield album)\n\nCurtis is the debut album by American soul musician Curtis Mayfield, released in September 1970. Produced by Mayfield, it was released on his own label Curtom Records. The musical styles of \"Curtis\" moved further away from the pop-soul sounds of Mayfield's previous group The Impressions and featured more of a funk and psychedelic-influenced sound. The album's subject matter incorporates political and social concerns of the time.\n\n\"Curtis\" sold well at the time charting at number one on the Billboard Black albums (for five nonconsecutive weeks) and number nineteen on the Billboard Pop albums charts. Only the single \"(Don't Worry) If There's a Hell Below, We're All Going to Go\" charted in the United States; however, an edited version of \"Move On Up\" would spend 10 weeks in the top 50 of the UK Singles Chart. \n\nMayfield began work on his own self-titled album in 1970. Although he never intended to leave the Impressions permanently, he would officially leave them in 1971, under recommendation from his business manager Marv Stuart and given the trend for both R&B and rock artists to go solo.\n\nLike with some of his later Impressions work, Mayfield's lyrics reflected the social and political concern rising in black America at the time. Mayfield was one of the earliest artists to speak openly about African-American pride and community struggle. Mayfield reflected upon this time as a \"happening era...when people stopped wearing tuxedos...people were getting down a little more.\"\n\nThe album had a more hard edged sound than the Impressions had before. On this new sound Mayfield claimed it was something he \"long wanted to do...but were out of category of what was expected of me and the Impressions. What I got off in the \"Curtis\" album allowed me to be more personal for myself.\". The two singles off the album \"(Don't Worry) If There's a Hell Below, We're All Going to Go\" and \"Move on Up\" showcased Mayfield's new funk musical style, while the rest of the tracks were much softer soul based songs. Not having any traditional music lessons, Mayfield claimed his backing band would occasionly comment \"gosh, this is a terribly strange key to play in\", but still played it accordingly as written. According to Joseph L. Tirabassi of \"Tiny Mix Tapes\", \"We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue\" exemplified the \"gliding soul\" and \"hard-hitting funk\" the rest of the album veered between.\n\nIn a contemporary review for \"Rolling Stone\", John Wendell was disappointed by \"Curtis\", finding much of Mayfield's music more rhythmic than melodic, \"fragmentary, garbled and frustrating to listen to\"; he called the lyrics haphazardly written and mealy-mouthed. \"He tries to deal with some pretty serious and complex subjects by stringing together phrases that end with the same sound—whether they make sense together or not\", Wendell critiqued. \"Sure, it's all subjective, but I can't myself see that what we need is 'Respect for the steeple/power to the people.'\" \"Village Voice\" critic Robert Christgau was also somewhat unmoved by the album's \"essentially middle-class guides to black pride\" but qualified his judgment as reflecting a certain degree of cultural relativism on his part, making note of African-American audiences having embraced the record.\n\nChristgau revisited \"Curtis\" in \"\" (1981) and found it far less middlebrow on further listens; later in \"Rolling Stone\", he said the album is song-for-song \"stronger than \"Superfly\"\". Bruce Eder from AllMusic said Mayfield had \"embraced the most progressive soul sounds of the era\" on an album that was \"practically the \"Sgt. Pepper's\" album of '70s soul\". In \"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\" (2004), Geoff Himes wrote that the songs remained irresistibly catchy, even though sometimes Mayfield's messages were oversimplified and the production sounded excessively \"ornate\".\n\nIn 1972, the French Academy of Jazz awarded Mayfield's \"Curtis\" the Prix Otis Redding for best R&B record.\n\nAll songs written and composed by Curtis Mayfield except where noted.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2033864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033864", "title": "A. D. Patel", "text": "A. D. Patel\n\nAmbalal Dahyabhai Patel, better known as A.D. Patel (1905 – 1 October 1969), was a Indo-Fijian politician, farmers' leader and founder and leader of the National Federation Party. Patel was uncompromisingly committed to a vision of an independent Fiji, with full racial integration. He was one of the first to advocate a republic, an ideal not realized in his lifetime. He also advocated a common voters' roll and opposed the communal franchise that characterized Fijian politics.\n\nPatel was born in the Kheda district of Gujarat, India, on 13 March 1905. He had three brothers and a sister. Ambalal and his younger brother, R. D. Patel, became barristers in Fiji (hence they were known as A.D. and R.D.). Ambalal received his primary and secondary education in Nadiad, which was the site used by Gandhi when he began his non-violent protest in India. He developed a habit of reading very early in his school days and excelled in secondary school. He then entered the prestigious Gujarat College in Ahmedabad and studied economics, politics and history. He graduated with Bachelor of Arts with honours in 1925 at the age of 20.\n\nFollowing his early academic success, she was sent to prepare to sit for the Indian Civil Service (ICS) examination. He enrolled in the London School of Economics to improve his chances of success in the exam by gaining direct experience of the English intellectual, social and political scene. In London he rubbed shoulders with other intellectuals from the sub-continent and became aware of the plight of Indians living in the other colonies. He changed his original plan for an ICS career without conferring with his parents joined the Middle Temple to qualify as a barrister, graduating in 1928 at the age of 23.\n\nPatel's father tried to persuade him to return and practice law in India and to help with the education of his younger siblings, but in the end helped pay his son's fare from London to Fiji, where he arrived on 11 October 1928. A reason for Patel to not want to return to India was his relationship with an English divorcee, Patricia Catherall Seymour, who had a son from her previous marriage. This was unacceptable for the Patel clan in India, especially since he had been betrothed to a girl from his community before leaving for London. Patricia Seymour arrived in Suva with her young son in 1933, and she and Patel were formally married on 25 January 1934. Their inter-racial marriage was strained by racially defined social hierarchy in Fiji. Patricia was ostracised by the local Europeans and she was unable to communicate with the local Indians. The couple separated in 1939 and divorced in 1943 and Patricia left for New Zealand.\n\nPatel was involved in the 1929 Legislative Council election campaign, together with S. B. Patel and Vishnu Deo, but was ineligible to stand as he did not meet the two-year residency requirement for candidates. He was involved in discussions with the Governor, Sir Murchison Fletcher, to resolve the political crisis brought about by the walkout of Fiji Indian members of the Legislative Council when their demand for common roll was rejected.\n\nBy 1930 Patel had taken up leadership positions in a number of organisations. These included president of the Fiji Indian Congress, formed from the merger of two rival organisations, president of the Indian association of Fiji, president of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Patron of the \"Gujarat Mandal\".\n\nIn 1935, when there was a proposal to have members of the Legislative Council nominated, instead of elected, Patel, together with Vishnu Deo, led the anti-nomination campaign from outside parliament as President and Secretary of the Indian Association of Fiji.\n\nPatel stood in the 1937 Legislative Council election for the North Western Indian Division. His opponent was Chattur Singh, a law clerk. Chattur Singh polled 671 votes to Patel's 651. Patel's loss was a surprise, especially since he was supported by the Indian Leadership in Fiji, which included Vishnu Deo. His defeat was due to a number of factors. Chattur Singh was a well known Ba resident, he was the President of the Ba branch of the Indian Association and his elder brother, Parmanand Singh, was one of the 3 Indians elected to the Legislative Council in 1929, Patel had angered the Muslim community because of his strong public stance against nomination (The Muslims had asked for their own representative to be nominated), Patel was a Gujarati whom the farmers saw as exploiters because of the high interest rate charged by the Gujarati merchants. The deciding factor was that Chatuur Singh had turned the election to one between Fiji-born and India–born and Patel did not make the situation better when he labelled Singh as having been born in a cane field.\n\nIn 1930 when the Sangam set up its first school, Patel became its manager. A. D. worked closely with Sadhu Kuppuswami, the founder of the Sangam, and Swami Avinashananda, sent by the Ramakrishna Mission on a fact finding mission to find out ways of promoting South Indian languages. On 31 October 1937 the Sangam was registered as a limited liability company, with Patel as general manager. Patel managed to persuade the government to exempt the Sangam from laws limiting ownership of land so that the Sangam could own up to one thousand acres (4 km²). Furthermore, Patel sought Sangam representation on the Board of Education, appealed for help in getting teachers from India to teach South Indian languages, and sought building grants from the Government. His persistence paid off when the Government paid the cost to bring two South Indian teachers from India to teach in Sangam schools. Patel's involvement in the Sangam deepened with the arrival of Swami Rudrananda in 1939.\n\nAlthough, in 1938, he had rejected overtures by the Kisan Sangh to take over its leadership, in June 1941, Patel formed the Maha Sangh with the support of Swami Rudrananda. In 1943, he led the sugar cane farmers on a prolonged strike after his demands for an increase in the price of sugar cane in line with inflation was rejected by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. When the majority of farmers refused to harvest their cane, the Government invoked the Defence Regulation and restricted Patel and Swami Rudrananda to a radius of five miles (8 km) from their homes in Nadi and required them to inform the police in person of their movements. Both Patel and Rudrananda decided to disobey the order and it landed both of them in court. This stirred up the farmers and a large number gathered in Nadi, holding prayer meetings. Shops were closed throughout the Western division. Both were fined £50 each or one month's prison in default. Both refused to pay, but before the five days allowed was over, an anonymous well-wisher paid the fine but Patel later won the case on appeal. The strike in the middle of a world war and his call for Indians to not join the army until they were given the same pay and conditions as Europeans, created a rift between Indians and Fijians which is remembered to this day.\n\nThe 1943 strike propelled Patel to the forefront of the political arena in Fiji and he easily won the 1944 Legislative Council election, defeating the sitting member for North West Viti Levu, by 1841 votes to 554. He retained the seat in the 1947 election, defeating Chattur Singh by 1972 votes to 1106. In 1948, with the support of three of the five ethnic Indians in the Legislative Council, he was appointed to the Executive Council, outmaneuvering his one-time ally Vishnu Deo. In the legislative council elections on 1950, however, he was defeated by Tulsi Ram Sharma of the rival Kisan Sangh. In the 1953 election, he was defeated by his old rival, Ayodhya Prasad of the Kisan Sangh, by 2718 votes to 1919 votes. During his days in the political wilderness, Patel concentrated on his law practice and continued to support the Sangam and the Ramakrishna Mission.\n\nIn 1947, while in India, Patel married Leela Ben, 20-year-old daughter of an old acquaintance of his. Patel then was 42 years old. They had five children and the break from politics between 1950 and 1963 allowed Patel to devote more time to his family and to his law practice.\n\nWith the 1950 contract due to expire in 1960, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company (CSR), in January 1959, drafted a new contract which rolled back most of the gains made by the farmers in the last 20 years. The growers were suspicious of the Company and in May 1959 decided to work together by forming the Federation of Cane Growers. Patel was a leading member of the Federation. A number of meetings were held between the Growers Federation, the Company and the Government. The Company refused to back down as it had a lot of sugar in stock and the talks soon broke down. The Governor suggested a commission of inquiry but this was rejected by Patel, who instead proposed a court of arbitration.\n\nOn 24 July 1960, Ayodhya Prasad of Kisan Sangh and Vijay R. Singh of Labasa Kisan Sangh, broke away and signed an agreement with CSR for the purchase of the 1960 crop. Tensions rose as Patel's opponents, B. D. Lakshman and Vijay R. Singh, accused him of again dividing the Indians and leading them further into debt and some Fijians, including Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, made calls to have Patel deported. The government appointed a commission of inquiry, headed by Sir Malcolm Trustram Eve, into the sugar industry. The Federation Committee was represented by Patel, assisted by S.M. Koya. Patel wanted legislation compelling CSR to keep it book of accounts in Fiji so that the Company could not cheat farmers from the proceeds of molasses, establishment of growers co-operative mills to break the monopoly of the CSR, setting up of an independent Sugar Board to oversee smooth functioning of the industry and the abolition of the Sugar Price Stabilisation Fund.\n\nThe finding of the commission was mostly against the demands of Patel. The idea of cooperative mill was rejected because the commission believed that the farmers could not manage it when could not even manage farms on their own. The commission supported CSR's idea of setting up wholly owned subsidiary for managing its activities in Fiji and the South Pacific Sugar Mills Limited was born. Future levies to the Sugar price Stabilisation Fund were abolished, although the fund remained in existence. Instead of a Sugar Board the commission recommended an Advisory Sugar Council. The commission agreed that the CSR had profited from molasses but did not recommend price increases demanded by growers. The commission supported the Company's submission of production control by weight instead of area. On the question of sharing the proceeds from the sale of sugar, the growers ended up worse off, getting a basic share of 57.75%, much less than what had been obtained under the 1950-1959 contract (62.6%). Eve also criticised Patel for adopting policies that harmed the growers and not showing a greater sense of responsibility to the country of his adoption.\n\nThe Federation Committee contested the 1963 Legislative Council election under the banner of Citizens Federation. It was not a properly constituted political party but sought to promote economic, cultural and political progress and stability in a united Fiji. All three Citizen's Federation candidates were elected to the Legislative Council. Patel defeated Deo Sharma, president of the Kisan Sangh by 6244 votes to 3346.\n\nThe success of the Citizens Federation in the 1963 elections, and the impending constitutional convention, prompted Patel to transform the Citizens Federation into a fully fledged political party. The Federation Party came into existence on 21 June 1964, with Patel as president and S.M. Koya as vice-president.\n\nThe Membership System was introduced on 1 July 1964, and Patel was appointed as the Member for Social Services taking over responsibility for cultural activities, education, health, prisons, social welfare and charitable societies. During his two years, as Member for Social Services, he carried out a number of significant changes. These included the establishment of the Western Regional Library in Lautoka with branches in Ba, Nadi and Sigatoka, the establishment of the Fiji National Provident Fund, reform to the prisons systems to laying greater emphasis on the reformative side of prisons. Patel promoted non-racial schools and authorised the closure of schools to reduce fragmentation, duplication of effort, unnecessary competition and communal segregation. He attempted to remove race form the names of schools but was unsuccessful due to strong opposition from Fijians. He also urged the Fiji Teachers Union and the Fijian Teachers Association to unite. He also spoke out about the need for a University in Fiji.\n\nA constitutional conference in London in 1965 had made minor concessions to Indo-Fijians, abolishing educational and property qualifications for the franchise while confirming the sectarian basis of the electoral system. The September, 1966 elections were fought on the issue of the new constitution with the newly formed Alliance Party applauding it and the Federation Party denouncing it. The Federation Party won all the nine Indian communal seats, obtaining 65.25 percent of the votes cast for these seats. Patel defeated his old rival, Ayodhya Prasad by 7601 votes to 4025. Ratu Mara was elected the Chief Minister and Patel became the Leader of the Opposition.\n\nEthnic tensions escalated following the adoption of responsible government in 1967, when Patel's arch-rival, the Lauan chief Ratu Kamisese Mara was appointed Chief Minister on 20 September. Mara's Alliance Party was a coalition of indigenous and European factions, with minimal Indo-Fijian participation. Patel and the NFP were consigned to the opposition benches. In protest at the new government's refusal to call a second constitutional conference, Patel led the nine NFP legislators in a mass walkout in September 1967. Missing two consecutive sections of the Legislative Council resulted in the forfeit of their seats, forcing by-elections.\n\nThe ensuing by-elections were marked by inter-ethnic violence. Patel's inflammatory language - he called Ratu Mara \"\"a crow among swans,\"\" declared that \"Mara\" was a swear-word in Gujarati, and characterized Chinese people as \"\"eaters of cats, rats, and bats\"\" - dissipated much of the remaining goodwill that Fijian and British leaders had towards him, and when all nine NFP legislators were returned with increased majorities (In the 1968 election, the NFP won 78.55% of the votes cast. Patel won by 7903 votes to 2772 for Manikam Pillai.), relations between the Indo-Fijian and indigenous communities appeared to be at a new low.\n\nPatel again took up the case on behalf of the farmers when arbitration proceedings were begun on 19 August 1969 for the new cane contract. He rejected the Eve contract, blaming it for leading the farmers deeper into debt. He spoke about the monopoly position of CSR, its secret accounting procedures, and concealed profits. He asked for a fairer price based on the price of sugar and its by-products. The Denning contract awarded the growers, 65% and the millers 35% of the proceeds of all sale, including molasses. It further guaranteed the growers a minimum price of $7.75 per ton of cane paid in two instalments. Denning commended Patel for having mastery of all the facts and problems of the sugar industry and presenting them with skill and understanding.\n\nPatel died suddenly on 1 October 1969, in the midst of negotiations leading to Fijian independence which was granted barely a year afterwards. Despite his republicanism and his strident opposition to institutionalizing ethnic and sectarian rights, which ethnic Fijians believed best protected their interests, at the time of his death he was beginning to show signs willingness to meet indigenous leaders half-way. His successor as leader of the NFP, Sidiq Koya, did in fact agree to such a compromise with Mara at a London conference in April 1970. Mara was of the opinion, however, that had Patel lived, an agreement with him would have commanded much greater respect in the Indo-Fijian community, such was his stature among them.\n\nMost Fijian leaders today take a kinder view of Patel. In 2005, then-Vice-President Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi concluded after a study of Patel's private correspondence that in reality he was not unsympathetic to indigenous interests, but was misunderstood.\n\n\n"}

Unlike the majority of his fellow Indo-Fijians, he was aligned with the Alliance Party of Prime Minister Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara in the 1970s and 1980s, and with the \"Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua\" Party of Laisenia Qarase in the early 2000s. He was one of only two Indo-Fijians to agree to serve in the interim government established in the wake of two military coups carried out to assert indigenous political supremacy in 1987.\n\nAli was a descendant of Indian indentured labourers brought to Fiji between 1879 and 1916. He was born in Suva and was educated at Marist Brothers' Primary and Secondary Schools. He obtained his MA in History from the University of Auckland and PhD from Australian National University.\n\nPrior to entering politics, Ali enjoyed a distinguished career as an academic. He was initially a high school teacher and later joined the University of the South Pacific as a lecturer in History and politics. He obtained a doctorate at the age of 37 years, then held senior positions at the University. He was Senior Lecturer and Reader in history and politics, and was the Head of the School of Social and Economic Development. He also was Dean of Academic Affairs, acting Deputy Vice-Chancellor as well as Director of the Institute of Social and Administrative Studies.\n\nAli published numerous papers and books on Fiji Indians and the indenture system that brought Indians to Fiji.\n\nIn 1982, Ali accepted the invitation of the leader of the Alliance Party, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, to enter politics contest the Lau/Cakaudrove/Rotuma national seat as Ratu Mara's running mate. He easily won the safest National seat for the Alliance and was appointed the Minister of Education. In his effort to upgrade facilities in ethnic Fijian schools, to staff them with better trained teachers and to provide better opportunities to Fijian students at University, he closed down the Nasinu Teachers College and turned it into a dormitory for University of the South Pacific’s Foundation (mostly Fijian) students to provide them with more tutorial help and an environment more conducive to studying. Ali's policy of large-scale arbitrary transfer of teachers brought together the two teachers' unions for the first time to oppose Government policy. There was also a hunger strike by final year students from the University of the South Pacific after the government refused to guarantee them jobs as teachers. In 1986, he was appointed Minister for Information, responsible also for broadcasting and the negotiations of the introduction of television in Fiji.\n\nAli was an early supporter of Sitiveni Rabuka's 1987 coup and served in his first administration as Minister for Information. He was Minister without Portfolio in the Interim Military Government from October to December, 1987. He then took on a career in the public service becoming Permanent Secretary for Youth, Employment Opportunities and Sports, Foreign Affairs and External Trade and Information and Communications. He also served in the diplomatic service as High Commissioner to Malaysia and earlier as Consul-General in Auckland.\n\nFollowing the parliamentary election held in 2001 to restore democracy following the coup d'état the year before, Ali was appointed to the Senate by Prime Minister Qarase. (9 of the 32 Senators are appointed by the Prime Minister). Ali was subsequently chosen as Vice-President of the Senate, a position he held until 20 December 2004, when he was appointed Minister for Information and Media Relations in the Qarase cabinet. He was to hold this portfolio till his death.\n\nFollowing a short illness, Ali died at the Prince of Wales Private Hospital in Sydney, Australia, on 8 June 2005. His funeral was held the next day at Sydney's Lakemba Mosque. The Fijian government was represented at the funeral by George Konrote, Fiji's High Commissioner to Australia, and by Ratu Meli Malani, Fiji's Consul to Sydney. Time constraints made it impossible for any Cabinet colleagues of Ali's to attend the funeral, which had to be held the day after his death in accordance with Muslim protocol.\n\nAli was survived by his wife, Bessie, and their two sons, Usman and Hashim. Supporters and opponents alike praised Ali for his love and loyalty to Fiji, and for his willingness to serve his country in a multitude of capacities.\n"}
{"id": "2033875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033875", "title": "Artificial leather", "text": "Artificial leather\n\nArtificial leather, also called synthetic leather, is a material intended to substitute for leather in upholstery, clothing, footwear, and other uses where a leather-like finish is desired but the actual material is cost-prohibitive or unsuitable. Artificial leather is marketed under many names, including \"leatherette\", \"faux leather\", \"vegan leather\", \"PU leather\" and \"pleather\".\n\nMany different methods for the manufacture of imitation leathers have been developed.\n\nOne of the earliest was \"Presstoff\". Invented in 19th century Germany, it is made of specially layered and treated paper pulp. It gained its widest use in Germany during the Second World War in place of leather, which under wartime conditions was rationed. \"Presstoff\" could be used in almost every application normally filled by leather, excepting items like footwear that were repeatedly subjected to flex wear or moisture. Under these conditions \"Presstoff\" tends to delaminate and lose cohesion.\n\n\"Poromerics\" are made from a plastic coating (usually a polyurethane) on a fibrous base layer (typically a polyester). The term poromeric was coined by DuPont as a derivative of the terms \"porous\" and \"polymeric\". The first poromeric material was DuPont's Corfam, introduced in 1963 at the Chicago Shoe Show. Corfam was the centerpiece of the DuPont pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair in New York City. After spending millions of dollars marketing the product to shoe manufacturers, DuPont withdrew Corfam from the market in 1971 and sold the rights to a company in Poland.\n\n\"Leatherette\" is also made by covering a fabric base with a plastic. The fabric can be made of natural or synthetic fiber which is then covered with a soft polyvinyl chloride (PVC) layer. Leatherette is used in bookbinding and was common on the casings of 20th century cameras.\n\nCork leather is a natural-fiber alternative made from the bark of cork oak trees that has been compressed, similar to \"Presstoff\".\n\nA fermentation method of making collagen, the main chemical in real leather, is under development.\n\nThe production of the PVC used in the production of many artificial leathers requires a plasticizer called a phthalate to make it flexible and soft. PVC requires petroleum and large amounts of energy thus making it reliant on fossil fuels. During the production process carcinogenic byproducts, dioxins, are produced which are toxic to humans and animals. Dioxins remain in the environment long after PVC is manufactured. When PVC ends up in a landfill it does not decompose like genuine leather and can release dangerous chemicals into the water and soil. \n\nPolyurethane is currently more popular for use than PVC.\n\nArtificial leathers are often used in clothing fabrics, furniture upholstery, and automotive uses. One disadvantage of plastic-coated artificial leather is that it is not porous and does not allow air to pass through; thus, sweat can accumulate if it is used for clothing, car seat coverings, etc. One of its primary advantages, especially in cars, is that it requires little maintenance in comparison to leather, and does not crack or fade easily.\n\n\n"}

Although born in Fronteras, Sonora, Mexico, Moraga spent most of his life in Alta California. He died in Santa Barbara.\n\nThe elder Moraga was a member of both expeditions of Juan Bautista de Anza to explore and consolidate the north-western limits of Spain's colonial claims in Alta California. The first expedition in 1774 established a new overland route from Sonora, Mexico to Mission San Gabriel. The second, in 1775-6, went as far north as San Francisco Bay.\n\nThe second expedition included a group of colonists for settlement at the newly established San Francisco Presidio, Mission San Francisco de Asís and Mission Santa Clara de Asís. The colonists included the Moraga family. José Moraga became commander of the garrison at San Francisco Presidio, and Gabriel became a soldier as well.\n\nAs a corporal, Gabriel Moraga was appointed \"comisionado\" (military administrator) of the Pueblo of San Jose, some years after its establishment by his father in 1777. When another civilian town, the Villa de Branciforte, was established in 1797 (part of today's city of Santa Cruz), Corporal Moraga was transferred to the same position there and was replaced at San Jose by Corporal Ignacio Vallejo, father of Mariano Vallejo.\n\nGabriel Moraga was one of the first Europeans to see the Central Valley of California. He led the first official Spanish expeditions to explore the valley in 1806–1808. Many of the names which Moraga gave to places in the region (especially rivers) have survived, often in shortened and/or anglicized form:\n\n\nNot all of Moraga's place names have survived. Today's Stanislaus River was named \"Rio de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe\" by Moraga. Even at the early date of Moraga's expedition, the name was redundant. Today's Guadalupe River was named in 1776 by the de Anza expedition.\n\nMany years after Gabriel Moraga's death, his widow Ana Joaquina Alvarado (1788–1863) was granted (in 1841) the Rancho Cañada Larga o Verde, not far from Mission San Buenaventura. Gabriel and Ana's son Joaquín was co-grantee of Rancho Laguna de los Palos Colorados in present-day Contra Costa County, part of which is now the city of Moraga, California.\n\n\n"}

An attacking batsman, he had a long career with Yorkshire and played eleven Tests for England. His nickname of 'Lucky' came from his habit of surviving the numerous chances, that his attacking batting style naturally created for the opposition. He was a fine deep fielder, and was said to be an excellent judge of a high catch, but did little bowling: his only really significant contribution with the ball came in 1896, when he took 5–42 against South of England. He also had one first-class stumping to his name, against Cambridge University in 1905.\n\nDenton was born in Wakefield, Yorkshire, and showed promise as a teenager, scoring a half-century in a Colts game in 1892. After three friendly (but nevertheless first-class) matches for Yorkshire in 1894, he made his Championship debut for the county in Yorkshire's final game of the season against Somerset, though he did not bat, bowl or take a catch. The following year, he scored useful runs against Cambridge University and also Lancashire, to establish his place in the side. That year he made a thousand runs for the first time, only once thereafter (in 1898) failing to reach that landmark.\n\nIn 1905, Denton had a fantastic year, scoring 2,405 runs earning himself Wisden Cricketer of the Year recognition in the 1906 \"Almanack\". Injury to Archie MacLaren resulted in Denton's elevation to the Test team in July 1905, to play against Australia at Headingley, Leeds, but he failed to make the most of his opportunity and was dismissed for 0 and 12, being dropped from the team immediately thereafter. He was recalled for the tour to South Africa that winter, and played in all five Tests. He made just one fifty in ten innings, and was again dropped from the side, but nevertheless played five more matches for England on a second and final tour of South Africa, in 1909/10. In the third Test at Johannesburg he made 104 at about a run a minute, but in no other innings did he even pass 30, and his England career came to a permanent end.\n\nDenton continued to play with considerable success for Yorkshire until after World War I, making his highest score of 221 against Kent in 1912, and scoring 209 not out at Worcester as late as June 1920, just a month short of his 46th birthday. He retired at the end of that year, and though afflicted by ill-health for a time, recovered enough to stand as a first-class umpire regularly from 1925 to 1930, and in occasional matches until 1937.\n\nHe died at the age of 75 in the town of his birth. His older brother, Joe Denton, also had a brief first-class career with Yorkshire in 1887 and 1888.\n\n"}

The 70-lap race was the eighth round of the 2005 Formula One season, the 43rd running of the Canadian Grand Prix, and the 37th running as a round of the World Championship. It set a ratings record and was the most watched F1 race in history. It was also the first of two consecutive North American rounds. The race was won by McLaren driver Kimi Räikkönen, taking his third win from four races. The two Ferrari cars completed the podium, with Michael Schumacher in second place and Rubens Barrichello in third. Both Renaults failed to finish the race, but the team maintained their lead in the Constructors' Championship; their driver, Fernando Alonso also kept his lead in the Drivers' Championship, despite the gap between himself and nearest rival Räikkönen closing by ten points.\n\nChristian Klien returned for the first of four confirmed races in the Red Bull Racing car, with American Scott Speed filling in the Friday testing role.\n\nAfter retiring on the last lap of the European Grand Prix, Kimi Räikkönen was the 11th driver on the track in qualifying, and he managed to line up 7th on the grid. Ferrari's Rubens Barrichello suffered a gearbox failure before the start of his qualifying lap, and was forced to abort his run. Jenson Button managed to take pole position, with Michael Schumacher second, and both Renault drivers on the second row.\n\nBarrichello, who would have been last on the grid, decided to start the race from pitlane, putting extra fuel in his car. At race start, both Button and Schumacher got away slowly, and Giancarlo Fisichella and Fernando Alonso took off well to move into first and second by the first corner. The McLarens of Juan Pablo Montoya and Räikkönen were also able to pass Schumacher, moving into 4th and 5th behind Button. Further back in the field, BAR's Takuma Sato made a small mistake, but did not lose a large amount of time. On the second lap, Fisichella was able to widen the gap back to Alonso, while local driver Jacques Villeneuve was forced to pit for a new front wing, leaving him at the back of the field. As the race continued, the Renault's pulled further away from the pack, and Barrichello was constantly moving up the field, up to 15th position by the end of lap 8. Narain Karthikeyan had a spin after a mistake in turn 1, allowing Jordan teammate Tiago Monteiro past.\n\nMichael Schumacher became the first driver to take his scheduled pitstop, refuelling on lap 12 to drop from 6th to 12th position. Three laps later, Button and Ralf Schumacher showed their hands, also entering the pits for more fuel. Button dropped from 3rd to 7th, leaving the two Renaults to lead from the two McLarens. On lap 21, the first of the two-stoppers pitted, with Felipe Massa, Nick Heidfeld and Klien all entering pitlane. The following lap, Sato entered his garage, apparently retiring from the race with gearbox trouble. Lap 24 saw the first of the leaders pit, with championship contenders Alonso and Räikkönen refuelling, before both of their teammates pitted on the following lap. On exiting the pits, Montoya went too fast on cold tyres, leaving the track and allowing Alonso to retain 2nd position. Karthikeyan hit the wall at the back end of the circuit, forcing him to retire from the race. Mark Webber, up to 7th position through a very long first stint, pitted on lap 28, and fed back into the race 9th, just ahead of Massa, Heidfeld and Ralf Schumacher. On the following lap, Webber went wide onto the grass, and in attempting to make up time, braked too late into the hairpin, running very wide and losing 3 positions. Barrichello became the final driver to pit on lap 31, dropping from 8th to 12th.\nAfter following close behind for several laps, and appearing to be quicker, Alonso passed teammate Fisichella for the lead on lap 33, but Fisichella obviously had a technical problem, as Montoya easily passed him on the same lap. Fisichella entered the pits to retire at the end of the lap, with hydraulic system problems. On lap 34, both Button and Michael Schumacher took their second stops, retaining 4th and 5th positions. On lap 35, Alonso led from Montoya, Räikkönen, Button, Schumacher and Jarno Trulli. However, on lap 39, Alonso ran wide at the exit of turn 4 and hit the outside wall, damaging his suspension and forcing him to retire from the race. This left Montoya in the lead, followed by Räikkönen. After following Massa for several laps, Heidfeld's BMW engine failed, allowing Ralf Schumacher into 7th and Webber to 8th. Takuma Sato rejoined the race 24 laps behind, after the B.A.R team fixed his car in order to gain him a slightly better starting position in qualifying for the following grand prix.\nOn lap 49, the gap from Montoya to Räikkönen was reduced to around 3 seconds. Button, under pressure from Michael Schumacher, made a mistake at the final chicane, hitting the inside kerb heavily, which forced him into the \"wall of champions\" on the outside. Button was forced to retire from the race, handing 3rd position to Schumacher, and causing the deployment of the safety car as Button's car was in a dangerous position. Every car took the opportunity to pit besides Montoya, who was forced to stay out an extra lap while Räikkönen was refuelled. On exiting the pits, Montoya re-entered the race under the safety car, which had just led the train of cars through turns 1 and 2. Montoya slipped into 2nd, slightly ahead of David Coulthard on track, although the Red Bull Racing driver had been lapped. Before the restart, Räikkönen led from Montoya, Michael Schumacher, Trulli, Webber, Massa, Barrichello and Ralf Schumacher. As the safety car re-entered the pits, Webber made a mistake into turn 1, allowing both Massa and Barrichello through, although the Sauber driver was forced wide and Barrichello moved into 5th. Soon after, it was announced that Montoya was under investigation by the stewards, and he was black-flagged (disqualified) from the race for exiting the pits while a red light was showing (as the safety car was on the pit straight), making it his 2nd consecutive disqualification in Canada.\n\nAs the race entered the closing stages, Michael Schumacher closed in on Räikkönen, who was troubled by a misaligned steering wheel. Trulli appeared to be having trouble with his brakes, and retired when they failed, leaving Barrichello in a comfortable 3rd position. However, Barrichello made a small error, allowing Massa to close up behind, but Webber was also close to Massa. Meanwhile, Takuma Sato appeared to have a mechanical failure which forced him to spin at the hairpin, before the rear of his car caught fire due to overheating. Räikkönen was able to retain his 1-second gap back to Schumacher to take the race win, with Barrichello more than 30 seconds behind in 3rd position. Webber was close to Massa into the final corner, but was unable to pass, leaving Massa to take a valuable 4th position and 5 championship points. Completing the pointscorers were Ralf Schumacher, Coulthard and Klien. The result meant Räikkönen reduced the gap in the championship standings to just 22 points, and the double-podium for Ferrari allowed them to close up in the constructors championship.\n\nNotes:\n\n"}

It is the largest Spanish-language newspaper in the United States and the second-most read newspaper in Los Angeles (after \"The Los Angeles Times\"). It is published by ImpreMedia, LLC.\n\nIts website, laopinion.com is the most read newspaper website in the United States, reaching more than 6 million readers each month. It has more than 500,000 followers on Facebook.\n\nThe paper was first founded and published on September 16, 1926, by Ignacio E. Lozano Sr. He emigrated from Mexico to San Antonio, Texas, in 1908, where Lozano first founded a Spanish-language daily newspaper known as \"La Prensa\" in 1913.\n\nWith the increase in the Mexican population Los Angeles experienced during the 1920s, Lozano believed he had a strong base for a Spanish newspaper in the growing city and founded \"La Opinión\" on September 16 to coincide with Mexico's Independence Day. The Lozano family retained control over both \"La Prensa\" and \"La Opinión\" until 1959 when \"La Prensa\" was sold.\n\nIn its early existence \"La Opinión\" consisted primarily of news from Mexico to accommodate the reading preferences of its audience, made up in large part by recently emigrated Mexicans. \"La Opinión\" was one of the few newspapers to provide comprehensive coverage of the deportations and repatriations of Mexicans during the 1930s as well as the Zoot Suit Riots of the 1940s.\n\nIn 1990, 50% ownership of the paper was sold to the Times Mirror Company, which merged with the Tribune Company in 2000. In 2004, ImpreMedia bought Tribune Company out and regained full control over \"La Opinión\".\n\nIn September 2014, they switched to a tabloid format.\n\nThe Lozanos continued to be involved in the operations of the newspaper. Leticia Lozano, the eldest child of Ignacio E. Lozano, Jr., worked at \"La Opinión\" from 1976 to 1984, at which point she got married and moved to Italy. Her younger brother, José Ignacio Lozano, was named Assistant Publisher in 1977 and Publisher in 1986. In 2004, \"La Opinión\" merged with New York City-based \"El Diario La Prensa\", the oldest Spanish-language newspaper in the United States, to form ImpreMedia LLC. José Lozano became Vice chairman of the new parent company, and his sister, Monica C. Lozano, also serves as Senior Vice President of ImpreMedia LLC. In 2004, Mónica Lozano, was named Publisher and CEO of \"La Opinión\". Monica Lozano's younger brother, Francisco Lozano, was promoted to ImpreMedia's corporate director of magazines in 2007. He previously worked as Sales Development Director for ImpreMedia and as National Sales Manager for \"La Opinión\".\n\nAll Lozano family assets, Lozano Enterprises, are wrapped up in ImpreMedia, which was formed from the combination of Lozano Enterprises and CPK Media, in 2004. ImpreMedia LLC is the first national Spanish-language newspaper company.\n\nIn May 2012, the Lozano family sold controlling interest in \"La Opinión\" to the Argentine newspaper \"La Nacion.\" Monica Lozano and the staff of \"La Opinión\" remain, but the family no longer controls the newspaper.\n\n\"La Opinión\" has vastly diversified its coverage from purely Mexican to include the Central American, South American, Cuban, Puerto Rican & Spanish populations that have grown in Los Angeles over the last quarter century. It now includes reporting on issues relevant to a wide variety of Hispanics. In the words of former Publisher Ignacio E. Lozano, Jr.: \"Our mission was no longer to be a Mexican newspaper published in Los Angeles, but an American newspaper that happens to be published in Spanish.\"\n\nSince 1986, \"La Opinión\"s editorial staff has doubled in size and the paper has grown to include bureaus in Sacramento, California, Washington DC and Mexico City. In 1999 and 2000, \"La Opinión\" was recognized by the National Association of Hispanic Journalists as the \"Outstanding Spanish Language Daily Newspaper of the Year\".\n\nIn 2006, \"La Opinión\" received the highest-ranking recognition in Spanish-language journalism, the José Ortega y Gasset Award from Spain’s distinguished \"El País\" newspaper. \"El País\" honored \"La Opinión\" for its pioneering trajectory over eighty years creating and maintaining an unprecedented media outlet for the growing Hispanic population in the United States.\n\nIn November 2007, \"La Opinión\" ranked #1 in net daily paid circulation growth among the 200 largest newspapers in America for the six-month period ending September 2007, based on the latest FAS-FAX Report from the Audit Bureau of Circulation.

Danny Schechter, a journalist who was then working with ABC News' \"20/20\", suggested turning the song into a different kind of \"We Are the World\", or as Schechter explains, \"a song about change not charity, freedom not famine.\"\n\nWhen Van Zandt was finished writing \"Sun City\", he, Schechter and producer Arthur Baker spent the next several months searching for artists to participate in the project. Van Zandt initially declined to invite Springsteen, not wanting to take advantage of their friendship, but Schechter had no problem asking and Springsteen accepted the invitation. Van Zandt was also shy about calling legendary jazz artist Miles Davis. Schechter initiated the contact and Davis also accepted. Eventually, Van Zandt, Baker and Schechter would gather an array of artists, described by rock critic Dave Marsh as \"the most diverse line up of popular musicians ever assembled for a single session\", including DJ Kool Herc, Grandmaster Melle Mel, Ruben Blades, Bob Dylan, Pat Benatar, Herbie Hancock, Ringo Starr and his son Zak Starkey, Lou Reed, Run–D.M.C., Peter Gabriel, Bob Geldof, Clarence Clemons, David Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks, Darlene Love, Bobby Womack, Afrika Bambaataa, Kurtis Blow, The Fat Boys, Jackson Browne, Daryl Hannah, Peter Wolf, Bono, George Clinton, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood, Bonnie Raitt, Hall & Oates, Jimmy Cliff, Big Youth, Michael Monroe, Stiv Bators, Peter Garrett, Ron Carter, Ray Barretto, Gil Scott-Heron, Nona Hendryx, Kashif, Lotti Golden, Lakshminarayana Shankar and Joey Ramone.\n\nThese artists also vowed never to perform at Sun City, because to do so would in their minds seem to be an acceptance of apartheid.\n\nSchechter had also taken on the job of documenting the sessions on video and producing a behind-the-scenes documentary, working with 16 mm crews and independent production companies, directed by Jonathan Demme. Paul \"Lucky\" Goldberg, director, producer and cinematographer for ThunderVision Media Ltd and president of Hollywood New York International since 1993, worked with producer and partner Paul Allen of ThunderVision Media Ltd, based in New York at Kaufman Astoria Studios to capture the action. Lucky and Paul introduced a new camera technology to work alongside the 16mm crews, the one-piece camera - Panasonic's Recam format for extensive handheld coverage of two days of the artists in the streets of Manhattan as well as a rendition of \"Sun City\" in Washington Square Park. Approximately 150 policemen surrounded the entire park on horseback and foot to secure the area for the performance, which included Van Zandt, Bono, Springsteen, the Fat Boys, Mötley Crüe, Afrika Bambaataa, Nona Hendryx and many others. One of the most notable shots was caught when Bono gave a huge kiss on the cheek to one of the Fat Boys, in his signature yellow satin jacket and red hat. They went on to shoot Sun City II in Central Park, capturing the politics and music of the spirit of Little Steven's award-winning \"Sun City\", including interviews with Peter Gabriel and Bono.\n\nSchechter invited MTV to get involved and asked a friend, Hart Perry, to film the sessions. During the course of the film, Schechter asks the artists to explain their involvement in the project in their own words: \"Sun City's become a symbol of a society which is very oppressive and denies basic rights to the majority of its citizens,\" said Jackson Browne. \"In a sense, Sun City is also a symbol of that society's 'right' to entertain itself in any way that it wants to, to basically try to buy us off and to buy off world opinion.\" Recalls Schechter, \"I was surprised that many of the best-known rock 'n rollers were so publicity shy. Most of them had publicists who staged their media appearances. They weren't used to cameras poking them in the face. Bruce Springsteen at first turned down my request for an interview, but just as I was walking away from him dejected, he ran after me and agreed to say a few words for the documentary.\n\n\"When Miles started improvising in the studio...Steven and Arthur [Baker] insisted I not approach him with a camera. 'It's Miles, man,\" Baker said. \"He's erratic, idiosyncratic, explosive. Wild. Don't mess with him when he's playing...' I barged into the booth while Davis was setting up, introduced myself and asked if we could videotape him. Through the glass I could see Steve and Arthur, heads in hands, convinced that I had blown it. Miles smiled. 'Bring it on,' he ordered, 'bring it on.' And we did, getting priceless footage in the bargain.\"\n\nIn addition to \"Sun City,\" a number of other songs were recorded, making up the album \"Sun City\".\n\nFor a time Van Zandt and Baker were making the record without a record company or any outside financial support. Van Zandt financed much of it while producer Arthur Baker (notable for his work with Afrika Bambaataa and New Order) donated studio time. Manhattan Records, under Bruce Lundvall's direction, came on board, acquiring rights to the recording and enabling Van Zandt and Baker to pay some of the bills. A committed record company attorney, the late Rick Dutka, also donated his time, along with noted music industry attorney, the late Owen Epstein as well as Van Zandt's assistant, Zoë Yanakis. Also, some New York's top recording engineers, studio musicians and recording studios donated their time as well as the artists who participated in recording Sun City. As well as lead vocals provided by notable artists Bruce Springsteen, Bono, Darlene Love, Run DMC, Lou Reed, Eddie Kendricks, Bonnie Raitt, Nona Hendryx and others, the signature background vocal sound was created by Lotti Golden, B.J.Nelson and Tina B. \n\nSchechter's connections with ABC News posed some risks. \"I couldn't tell ABC what I was doing on the side,\" recalls Schechter. \"They would not have approved. I knew I couldn't propose a story about Sun City either, because I had stepped over the line and become part of the story. I tried and mostly succeeded in keeping my name out of the papers and my mug out of the video. I was terrified that 20/20 would dump me if they knew what I was doing, especially if my affiliation with ABC was dragged into it, even though the network had nothing to do with the project. I worked even harder at ABC, producing more stories than many of my colleagues, so I couldn't be accused of slacking off.\" \n\nThe song \"Sun City\" was only a modest success in the US, reaching #38 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart in December 1985. Only about half of American radio stations played \"Sun City,\" with some objecting to the lyrics' explicit criticism of President Ronald Reagan's policy of \"constructive engagement.\"\n\nMeanwhile, \"Sun City\" was a major success in countries where there was little or no radio station resistance to the record or its messages, reaching #4 in Australia, #10 in Canada, #3 in The Netherlands and #21 in the UK.\nThe song was banned in South Africa.\n\nVan Zandt and Schechter also struggled to get the documentary seen. Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) refused to broadcast the non-profit film \"The Making of Sun City\" even though it won the International Documentary Association's top honors in 1986; PBS claimed the featured artists were also involved in making the film and were therefore \"self-promoting.\" (In contrast, PBS chose to broadcast \"The Making of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\"\", which was made as a promotional exercise by the for-profit Paramount Pictures and Lucasfilm Ltd.) In 1987, WNYC-TV, the New York City-owned public television station, aired an updated version of the documentary, produced by filmmaker Bill Lichtenstein along with Schechter. The film included updates about the Sun City resort and apartheid as well as the success of the Sun City video. In addition to airing the documentary, WNYC-TV made the film available over the PBS system to public television stations across the country for broadcast.\n\nThe album and single raised more than a million U.S. dollars for anti-apartheid projects. It premiered at the United Nations, thanks to the Special Committee Against Apartheid and UN officers such as Aracelly Santana.\n\nThe record never achieved the financial success of \"We Are the World,\" although Oliver Tambo and the ANC's school in Tanzania \"was sure happy when we gave them a big check,\" according to Schechter.\n\nIn South Africa, \"Sun City\" would later inspire musician Johnny Clegg to create a local organization similar to Van Zandt's, and \"Sun City\" also became the catalyst for the \"South Africa Now\" TV series.\n\nWith the end of the apartheid regime in 1994 and the reintegration of Sun City and other former nominally-independent regions into the South African state, \"Sun City\" ceased to be a contemporary protest and became a historical document.\n\nIn 1997, the man who created Sun City, Sol Kerzner, came to the United States to build the Mohegan Sun, a Native American gambling casino.\n\n"}

Böhme was arrested for trial by a US Army Tribunal in Nuremberg in the Hostages Trial on a charge of having massacred thousands of Serbian civilians. He committed suicide in prison.\n\nDuring the opening years of World War II, Böhme held command of the 30th Infantry Division and 32nd Infantry Division, taking part in the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and in the Battle of France in May and June 1940. On 29 June 1940, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.\n\nBetween 16 September 1941 and 2 December 1941, as Commanding General and Commander of Serbia, Böhme ordered the reprisal executions of 2,000 civilians in Kragujevac after a partisan assault on 22 soldiers of the 421 Korps-Nachrichten-Abteilung.\n\nIn December 1943, Böhme was appointed Deputy Commanding General of the XVIII Corps and Commander of Wehrkreis [Military District] XVIII, Salzburg.

He increased the scale of retaliatory strikes against Serbs, killing a hundred Serbs for every German killed, and fifty for every German wounded; this resulted in the massacre of thousands of civilians. When his extradition to Yugoslavia seemed imminent, Böhme committed suicide by jumping from the 4th story of the prison in which he was being held.

He is professional football's all-time passing yards leader, and first in all-time CFL passing yards. In his career, he passed for 79,816 yards and is one of seven professional quarterbacks to have completed over 400 touchdown passes (the others being Brett Favre, Warren Moon, Peyton Manning, Dan Marino, Tom Brady, and Drew Brees). Calvillo won three Grey Cup championships in 2002, 2009, and 2010, and named Grey Cup Most Valuable Player in 2002. He also won the CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award three times, in 2003, 2008, and 2009, which ties him for second all-time behind Doug Flutie. Calvillo announced his retirement on January 21, 2014. Calvillo was an assistant coach for the Alouettes from 2015 to 2017 and with the Toronto Argonauts in 2018.\n\nCalvillo was born in Los Angeles, California. While attending La Puente High School, he was a two-sport standout in football and basketball. He is of Mexican-American descent.\nAnthony grew up with an alcoholic and abusive father. Sports were his escape.\n\nCalvillo spent two seasons at Mt. San Antonio College before transferring to Utah State University in 1992. After a solid junior year as starting quarterback, he had a terrific senior season in 1993. He set a school record with 3,260 yards of total offense in the regular season, and he also set a school record with 5 touchdown passes in a single game (he did it twice). With Calvillo leading the offense, USU won the Big West Conference championship for the first time since 1979. The Aggies finished the year with a 42-33 win over Ball State in the Las Vegas Bowl; Calvillo passed for 386 yards and 3 touchdowns to win MVP honors. It was Utah State's first-ever bowl victory. Calvillo wore number 13 and played under former NFL Seattle Seahawks quarterback, Jim Zorn. It wasn't until his last year of university, when he began to believe that he could be a professional football player, even though he was not invited to attend the NFL evaluation day at his University.\n\nAfter not being drafted by an NFL team, Calvillo started his Canadian Football League career in 1994 with the US expansion Las Vegas Posse.. Calvillo beat out 13 other Quarterbacks who were trying to make the team. Again, he wore # 13.\n\nAfter the Posse folded a year later in the CFL U.S. expansion experiment, Calvillo was selected first overall by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the dispersal draft. While in Hamilton, Calvillo served as a backup quarterback to players such as Steve Taylor and Matt Dunigan. He wore number 18 as a Hamilton Tiger Cat.\n\nIn 1998, Calvillo signed as a free agent with the Montreal Alouettes, where he became one of the most outstanding quarterbacks in history. He led the Alouettes to the 2002 Grey Cup, their first in 25 years, where he was named the most valuable player in the game.\nDuring the 2003 CFL season, Calvillo broke numerous Montreal Alouette passing records, completing 408 of 675 passing attempts for 5,891 yards and 37 touchdowns. In 2004, with 6,041 passing yards, Calvillo became the fourth quarterback in CFL history to pass for more than 6,000 yards in a single season (Doug Flutie, David Archer, and Kent Austin being the other three), earning him the East Division nomination for Most Outstanding Player for the third consecutive year. With Calvillo quarterbacking the Alouettes' offence, the 2004 Alouettes became the first team in CFL history to have four players with over 1,000 yards receiving in the same season: Ben Cahoon (1183 yards), Jeremaine Copeland (1154 yards), Thyron Anderson (1147 yards), and Kwame Cavil (1090 yards). In 2005, Calvillo and the Alouettes repeated the feat of four receivers over 1,000 yards: Kerry Watkins (1364 yards), Terry Vaughn (1113 yards), Ben Cahoon (1067 yards), and Dave Stala (1037 yards).\n\nThe 2008 CFL season saw Calvillo hit a number of career milestones. On June 26, in a game against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Calvillo surpassed Danny McManus to become the second-all-time leading passer in the CFL. On July 31, in another game against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Calvillo became the fourth quarterback in league history to reach 300 career touchdown passes. On August 15, 2008, in a game against the Toronto Argonauts, Calvillo became the second quarterback in CFL history after Damon Allen to reach 4,000 career pass completions. With 5,633 passing yards and 43 touchdown passes, Calvillo won the 2008 Most Outstanding Player award. Calvillo led the Montreal Alouettes to the 2008 Grey Cup final, which the Alouettes lost 22-14 to the Calgary Stampeders.\n\nIn 2009, Calvillo added to his club records while reaching more CFL milestones. On July 23, 2009, he surpassed Canadian Football Hall of Famer Ron Lancaster's 334 career touchdown passes to move into second place all time. He sat out two games during the regular season, but still accumulated 4639 yards while posting a remarkable 72.0% completion rate, the second best single-season completion rate in CFL history behind Dave Dickenson's 73.98% mark set in 2005. Calvillo led Montreal to a 16-point fourth quarter comeback victory in the 97th Grey Cup on Nov. 29, when the Alouettes defeated the Saskatchewan Roughriders 28-27 on a last-second field goal known as the \"13th Man\" finish.\nCalvillo won his third Grey Cup on November 28, 2010 at 98th Grey Cup in Edmonton, Alberta where he defeated the Saskatchewan Roughriders 21-18 for the second year in a row. He added to his record total of passing yards in Grey Cup games with 2470 yards, as well as setting the record for Grey Cup starts with eight. As of the 2010 CFL season, Calvillo is 3-5 in Grey Cup Championship Games.\n\nIn a post-game interview, he revealed that he would be undergoing off-season surgery to remove a lesion on his thyroid that was discovered after he injured his sternum during the season. On December 21, 2010, it was reported that Calvillo had successful thyroidectomy surgery to remove a cancerous lesion.\n\nOn July 15, 2011, in a game against the Toronto Argonauts, Calvillo completed his CFL record 395th career touchdown pass to Éric Deslauriers. On August 4 of that same season, and again against the Argonauts, Calvillo completed his 5159th pass completion to Brandon London to move past Damon Allen to become the leader in that category as well. Then, on October 10, 2011, Calvillo completed a touchdown pass to Jamel Richardson to become professional football's all-time leading passer, in the Alouettes' third and final game against the Toronto Argonauts that year. In 2012, Calvillo became the only player in football history to pass 5,000 yards seven times in his career. He reached 4,000 yards passing eleven times in his career (a CFL record), only Peyton Manning of the NFL has reached the 4,000 mark more times in his career with fourteen 4,000 yard seasons. He also set another CFL record having 8 consecutive 300+ passing yards games in a single season, breaking the record he shared with Doug Flutie.\n\nCalvillo signed a 2-year contract on December 13, 2012, with the deal keeping him with the Al's through the 2014 season. In Week 8 of the 2013 CFL season Calvillo left the game after taking a hit from Saskatchewan's Ricky Foley. Three days after the game it was announced that he had suffered a concussion, and missed the Week 9 game against the BC Lions and the Week 10 game against the Toronto Argonauts. On September 4, 2013 the Al's placed Calvillo on the 9-game injury list. On October 18, 2013 the Montreal Alouettes general manager and head coach Jim Popp announced that Calvillo would not be returning to play for the remainder of the 2013 season.\n\nOn January 21, 2014, Calvillo announced his retirement from professional football. Before his retirement, he was offered the offensive coordinator position with the Alouettes but declined. On October 13, 2014, Calvillo's jersey number, #13, was retired in a halftime ceremony at McGill Stadium. Upon his retirement, he was the last active player that played for an American-based CFL team during its expansion to the US in the mid-1990s.\n\nOn December 15, 2014, the Montreal Alouettes announced that Calvillo would be joining the team as an offensive coach in 2015. On January 29, 2015, Calvillo was appointed as the receivers coach. After the firing of Alouettes Head Coach Tom Higgins, Calvillo was named the Quarterbacks coach for the Alouettes on August 22, 2015. After a few weeks, the team's offensive coordinator, Turk Schonert, was fired and Calvillo was named co-offensive coordinator along with Ryan Dinwiddie. Going into the 2016 season, Calvillo was named offensive coordinator with Jacques Chapdelaine as his special advisor as he grew into the role. After head coach Jim Popp resigned and Chapdelaine was promoted to that position, Chapdelaine also took over play-calling duties from Calvillo. For the 2017 season, Calvillo was announced as the quarterbacks coach.\n\nOn March 19, 2018, the Argos announced the hiring of Calvillo as their quarterback coach. The hire reunited Calvillo with his former general manager Jim Popp, and head coach Marc Trestman.\n\nOn December 19, 2018, Calvillo was named as the assistant head coach for the Montreal Carabins football team in U Sports. The move reunited Calvillo with Danny Maciocia, who was an offensive coach with the Alouettes from 1996 to 2001.\n\n\nIn 2012 in honour of the 100th Grey Cup, Canada Post used his image on a series of commemorative postage stamps. The image was also used on presentation posters and other materials to promote the Grey Cup game and other celebrations associated with the centennial.\n\nOn October 13, 2014, the Alouettes organization retired Calvillo's number 13 in a half-time ceremony.\n\nHe was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\nCalvillo and his wife Alexia have two daughters and reside year-round in Montreal.\n\n"}

He is often referred to by his nickname \"El Gringo\", given to him in his childhood because his parents are both Spanish, and his blue eyes.\n\nKnown for his speed and solid defensive work rate, Castro was a good marker and counter-attacker who was trained in the Club América youth system. He made his debut in the Mexican Championship against Leon in the 2000–2001 season. After receiving little playing time in his first two seasons with the senior team, Castro became a vital player for the club in the Verano 2002 season, displaying fine form which helped Club América win the Mexican league championships in 2002 and the Clausura title in 2005.

He then launched a radio career as an announcer in Akron, Ohio.\n\nMoving to Hollywood, he became a Warner Brothers contract actor at $100 a week in 1943. The studio darkened and straightened his curly red hair and covered his freckles. At first he was billed as Stephen Richards. They gave him small parts, often uncredited, in films like \"Destination Tokyo\" (1943), \"Passage to Marseille\" (1944), \"The Doughgirls\" (1944), \"Hollywood Canteen\" (1944), \"Objective, Burma!\" (1945), \"God Is My Co-Pilot\" (1945), \"The Horn Blows at Midnight\" (1945), \"Rhapsody in Blue\" (1945) and \"Pride of the Marines\" (1945).

Stevens was borrowed by RKO to play the lead role in \"From This Day Forward\" (1946) with Joan Fontaine.\n\nBack at Fox Stevens was in \"The Dark Corner\" (1946) with Lucille Ball and Clifton Webb, a film noir that attempted to repeat the success of \"Laura\" (1944). In 1946 exhibitors voted him the fifth-most promising \"star of tomorrow\".\n\nFox put him in a musical with June Haver, \"I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now\" (1947), playing Joseph E. Howard. It was a big hit. So too was \"The Street With No Name\" (1948), where Stevens played an FBI man going undercover to arrest a gangster played by Richard Widmark, and \"The Snake Pit\" (1948), where he played Olivia de Havilland's loyal husband.\n\nStevens was in a Western, \"Sand\" (1949) and another musical biopic with Haver, \"Oh, You Beautiful Doll\" (1949), playing Fred Fisher. He supported William Powell in \"Dancing in the Dark\" (1949).\n\nStevens was borrowed by MGM to play Matthew Kinston, one of Deborah Kerr's three suitors in \"Please Believe Me\" (1950). For Columbia he starred in the film-noir \"Between Midnight and Dawn\" (1950).\n\nStevens then signed a contract at Universal: \"Target Unknown\" (1951), a war film; \"Katie Did It\" (1951), a romantic comedy; \"Little Egypt\" (1951) with Rhonda Fleming; \"Reunion in Reno\" (1951).\n\nIn 1951, he starred in the DuMont series \"News Gal\" which was later syndicated on ABC in 1957.\n\nStevens made \"Mutiny\" (1952) for the King Brothers and went to England for \"The Lost Hours\" (1952).\n\nHe was in \"Torpedo Alley\" (1953). Stevens took over the lead role in \"Martin Kane, Private Eye\" from 1953-54.\n\nFrom 1954 to 1956 he played a newspaper managing editor in the CBS Television series \"Big Town\", having replaced Patrick McVey, who starred in the role from 1950-54. Reruns of \"Big Town\" began airing on DuMont under the title \"City Assignment\" while new episodes of the series were still appearing on CBS.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s he directed several features: \"Cry Vengeance\" (1954); \"Time Table\" (1956); \"Gun Fever\" (1958); \"Man on a Raft\" (1958); \"The Man in the Water\" (1963) and \"Sunscorched\" (1966).\n\nAs an actor only, he was in \"Gunsight Ridge\" (1956), \"September Storm\" (1960) and \"Fate is the Hunter\" (1964).\n\nFrom the 1960s Stevens lived in semi-retirement in Spain. His occasional film credits include \"Spain Again\" (1969) and \"The Fury of the Wolfman\" (1972). In the 1980s he made guest appearances \"Magnum, P.I.\", \"Murder, She Wrote\" and other television shows.\n\nOn September 15, 1994, Stevens died of cancer in Majores, Spain, at the age of 77.\n\nFor his contribution to the television industry, Mark Stevens has a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame, located at 6637 Hollywood Blvd.\n\n"}
{"id": "2033929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033929", "title": "Čubura", "text": "Čubura\n\nČubura (), ) is an urban neighborhood of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. Located in Belgrade's municipality of Vračar, it is a synonym of the city's bohemian life.\n\nČubura stretches along the crossroad of the streets of \"Makenzijeva\"-\"Cara Nikolaja II\" and \"Maksima Gorkog\". It borders the neighborhoods of Vračar and Gradić Pejton (sub-neighborhood of Čubura) on the west, Kalenić on the north, Crveni Krst on the east, Neimar on the southwest and Pašino Brdo on the south.\n\nČubura originated as a village around the pond and the banks of the stream of \"Čuburski potok\". The village began to transform into the suburb in the 1880s. It was a period when a Romani colony was resettled from the neighborhood of Zerek (Dorćol area, around the \"Kralja Petra\" Street), so they moved to Čubura.\n\nThe stream is not visible today as it has been completely conducted underground and runs through the Belgrade's sewage system (which is a case with many streams and creeks in the urban parts of Belgrade). The stream originated at the modern crossroad of the \"Kičevska\" and \"Baba Višnjina\" streets. It was then flowing downhill in the south direction, reaching the northern slope of Pašino Brdo. There, it turned in the west-southwest direction and flew into the Mokroluški Potok at modern Autokomanda neighborhood, close to the Topovske Šupe locality. Its lower valley was used for construction of the \"Južni Bulevar\" (South Boulevard) street, which today marks the southern border of the modern neighborhood of Čubura. While the stream flew above the ground, there was a small bridge across it at the lowest point, connecting Čubura and Pašino Brdo.\n\nSpring of the stream was also in this area and, after a short flow, the water was collected in a small cylindrical trough (Serbian: \"stublina\", Turkish: \"çubura\") and this is how the village and the future neighborhood got its name. The romanticized version claims that the name comes from \"čubar\", Serbian name for the purple summer savory flower which allegedly was abundant around the former stream. The trough apparently didn't collected the water from the stream itself, but from one or two additional springs with fresh water in the valley.\n\nThere was a monument to the Romani people who died in World War I fighting in Serbian army. The monument is mentioned in 1924 work \"Spomenici na okrajini Beograda\" (\"Monuments on the edges of Belgrade\") by Milan Vukićević. The stone monument was located right above the stream and had inscription \"Serbian Gypsy Youth to its heroes killed 1912-1918\". The rapid urbanization of Čubura ensued after the war ended and by 1939 when \"Vreme\" magazine wrote in detail about the neighborhood, the monument wasn't mentioned anymore. Based on the writings, it was located somewhere close to the modern park. In March 2018 it was announced that the monument wasn't destroyed. In 1924 it was moved to the yard in the \"Gospodara Vučića\" Street, in the nearby Pašino Brdo, not far away from its original location. The lot is today owned by the Romany organization \"Društvo Rom\" and the monument has been updated with some names of those killed in World War II.\n\nThe population of Čubura was 13,498 in 2002. The neighborhood is characterized by narrow streets and thanks to many kafanas in the area, it became known as one of the centers of the city bohemians. Unlike Skadarlija which is considered to be a fancy and fashionable place, Čubura used to be a gathering place of common people. Decades old neglect of the neighborhood by the city governments also added to this feel. It is recorded that in 1941, on the short distance from Slavija along the \"Makenzijeva\" street, there were 30 kafanas. After 1945, the \"Vltava\" kafana, for example, became known as the gathering place of Belgrade's lawyers, \"Mala Vltava\" of the former political prisoners from the Goli Otok while the more affluent citizens gathered in \"Trandafilović\". However, with changes in recent years, kafanas are being closed one by one and the 'spirit of Čubura' is slowly disappearing.\n\nOne of the last kafanas, \"Kolubara\", was transformed into the betting facility while \"Čuburska lipa\" (\"Ćubura's linden tree\"), was demolished in early 2018. It was named after the linden tree, planted in 1924, brought from Lipik spa. The tree was also cut. With the new buildings being constructed, many white and mimicking the Interbellum architecture in the kitsch style, architects described Čubura as being filled with \"sugar-coated cake-houses\".\n\nAccording to the city government's plans published in early 2007, a residential section along the even side of the \"Maksima Gorkog\" street is designated for demolition for the future expansion of the street.\n\nSmall park (\"Čuburski park\") is located in the neighborhood, bounded by the streets of \"Maksima Gorkog\", \"Cara Nikolaja II\", \"Čuburska\" and \"Orlovića Pavla\". It covers an area of 11 hectares and is mostly occupied by the children playgrounds (three of them) and seasonal amusement park. In November 2007 a major reconstruction of the park began which includes replacement of the complete humus layer and all of the old and sick trees, placing a sewage system beneath the park to prevent creation of ponds in the park during rains so as the re-arrangement of the pathways bordering the park. Reconstruction was finished in April 2008.\n\nOn 12 May 2009 a monument to the Serbian writer Petar Kočić was dedicated in the park. In the period when he lived in Belgrade, Kočić lived in the vicinity of the park. The duplicate of the monument, work of Dragoljub Davidović, was erected in front of Kočić's birth house in the village of Stričići, near Banja Luka in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nOn 16 June 2019, another monument was placed in the park, at the corner of the \"Maksima Gorkog\" and \"Cara Nikolaja II\" streets. It is dedicated to the famed self-taught builders from Crna Trava. Residents of Crna Trava are regionally famous as the best builders, which are colloquially described as the builders who \"built half of Yugoslavia: University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy, University of Belgrade Faculty of Law, Stari dvor, Novi dvor, Government of Serbia, Princess Ljubica's Residence, Kafana Dva Jelena in Skadarlija, Hotel Moskva, Hotel Bristol, factory chimneys over tall, and countless other. The monument represents nameless \"Crna Trava builder\" (\"Crnotravac neimar\") and was sculptured by Zoran Kuzmanović. The park was chosen as it was the location of the \"Kikevac\" kafana, which was the central gathering point of the Crna Trava migrants in Belgrade. A duplicate of the tall sculpture on the stone pedestal was erected in Crna Trava itself, on 29 October 2019.\n\n"}
{"id": "2033932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033932", "title": "Survivorman", "text": "Survivorman\n\nSurvivorman is a Canadian-produced television program, broadcast in Canada on the Outdoor Life Network (OLN), and internationally on Discovery Channel and Science Channel. The title refers to the host of the show, Canadian filmmaker and survival expert Les Stroud, who uses survival skills and knowledge to survive alone for up to ten days (seven days during the first three seasons and ten days during seasons four and five), in remote locales where he brings with him little or no food, water, or equipment. According to the show's website, each location was scouted and planned extensively by Stroud and his team who consulted with survival specialists and natives of each area. The fact that Stroud is not accompanied by a production crew and performs the filming himself is a major focus of the show.\n\nDuring the videotaping of each episode, Stroud is alone and operates all the cameras himself, while his support team monitors him from a distance. He is equipped with only his clothes, camera equipment, his harmonica, a multi-tool, and often \"everyday items\" relevant to the episode's particular survival situation or locale. For safety purposes, Stroud carries an emergency satellite phone and normally has daily radio contact with his support crew that is always within rescue range. However, Stroud has stated that while videotaping several episodes, there were times when his emergency phone did not work, leaving him totally alone and has mentioned his concern that his rescue crew may become stranded with him. On a few occasions, Stroud has also been provided with a rifle for safety reasons or as part of the survival situation; in the first-season episode \"Canadian Arctic\", the local experts he consulted insisted that because of polar bears they would not let him go without a rifle.\n\n\"Survivorman\" can be considered a sequel or spin-off to Stroud's earlier project, \"Stranded\", a five-part series that was shown on the Canadian Discovery Channel in 2001.\n\nStroud stopped videotaping \"Survivorman\" after the third season due to what he described as the significant physical toll of videotaping each episode. As of 2012, reruns from the first three seasons are still broadcast on OLN and Discovery.\n\nOn November 23, 2011, Stroud's official website announced the show would be returning for a series of specials in which he would \"up the ante\" by surviving alone in ten-day stretches, three more days than in the original episodes. Part one of the first hour-long special was broadcast on June 30, 2012, on OLN. It was announced that Stroud would be producing another Survivorman season for OLN to be aired in April/May 2015.\n\nIn each episode, Stroud places himself in a unique survival situation. The show is meant to demonstrate how one might survive alone, in a remote location, with minimal supplies until being rescued. Finding food, water, and materials to make fire and shelter pose the main challenges of each episode.\n\nAccording to its official website, the show includes Stroud dealing with the aftermath of unsuccessful or inappropriate survival techniques and decisions. The reasons for these errors can include time limitations, being unfamiliar with a technique, or misjudging weather conditions, all frequently encountered by people in survival situations. While acknowledging the errors and the negative effect on his emotional state that they can create, Stroud usually remains calm, which is described as being vital to successful survival.\n\nIn addition to the physical challenges posed by each survival situation, Stroud confronts the psychological effects of isolation, physical injury, and exhaustion. Throughout the episode, Stroud narrates to the camera, commenting on his physical and psychological state, providing survival tips, and making jokes. Stroud also often dismantles available equipment (e.g., bicycle, snowmobile, airplane) that he happens to come across in the wild and puts it to another practical use.\n\nPrior to each episode, Stroud relies heavily on local experts to brief him on flora and fauna and key survival techniques unique to that particular location. Drawing upon this local knowledge and guidance, Stroud shows the audience how to find viable sources of nourishment, avoid dangerous or unhealthy ones, and utilize them appropriately and efficiently. Stroud frequently explains that gathering food in this manner should be reserved for true survival situations in order to preserve the environment.\n\nStroud's survival situations are reported to have helped numerous people in real-life situations who found themselves stranded in the elements.\n\nExcept for footage of him arriving at his new setting, and being retrieved at the end of the week, the content of each episode is taped entirely by Stroud himself using several DV cameras that he must carry with him everywhere that he goes (he later switched to a number of HDV cameras). The burden of having to carry, place, and retrieve the camera equipment for each shot adds to the challenge and difficulty of each survival situation, and in several episodes Stroud chooses to leave a camera behind, videotaping him as he departs the area (the camera is retrieved later), and in one episode taking place in the Amazon, Stroud is forced to flee his camp and abandon all but two of his cameras due to fear of a stalking jaguar. His camera and audio gear typically weigh about in total. During the \"Behind the Scenes\" episode, Stroud explains that \"setting up or tearing down all of my camera gear takes about 65% of my time.\" The episode also explains that Stroud and his team extensively scout their locations ahead of time and consult with survivalists and natives to the area. The goal is both to ensure Stroud's safety and to sketch out interesting scenarios and techniques that can be illustrated on the show. He later records a voice-over commentary in the studio, where he explains his decision-making process and details of how he accomplished various tasks.\n\nOn July 16, 2007, Stroud and a support crew of four in the nearby safety camp were cited by the United States National Park Service for commercial videotaping without a permit at Taroka Arm, a seldom-visited area at Kenai Fjords National Park in Alaska. Investigators found a driftwood shelter surrounded by multiple cameras on the beach. The support crew was camped near a sensitive archaeological site. Stroud paid the required application, location, and monitoring fees, totaling approximately US$2,800.\n\nIn September 2012, Stroud stated in a compilation show (Survivorman Top-10) that at one time he had contracted a parasitic worm infestation in his mouth that lasted over a year. Stroud stated that he was not sure of the origin of the malady, though he believes that the source was from Georgia swamp turtle meat (season 1, episode 4).\n\n\n"}

He is also known for being the first head coach of the North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team.\n\nWhile the reason why Cartmell was nicknamed \"Bloody Neck\" is not entirely known, author Ken Rappoport speculates that it either comes from his use of the term Bloody due to the fact his family came from Cartmel, England, or from the fact that he had a childhood accident where he lost two and a half fingers from his right hand when an ax slipped while he was chopping wood.\n\nIn the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, Cartmell won silver medals in both the 100 meter dash and the 200 meter straightaway. He also participated in the 60 meters event but was eliminated in the repechage.\n\nCartmell was a member of the gold medal American medley relay team at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London. He was the second runner on the squad, running 200 meters. He followed William Hamilton and was followed by John Taylor and Mel Sheppard. In both the first round heat and the final Cartmell received a lead from Hamilton and built upon it before turning over the race to Taylor. The team won both races, running the 1,600 meters in 3:27.2 in the first round and 3:29.4 in the final. Cartmell's split for the final was 22.2 seconds.\nHe won the bronze medal in the 200 meter race at the same Games, taking his second medal in the event. In the first round, Cartmell won with a time of 23.0 seconds. The second round resulted in a 22.6-second time and another win. Cartmell placed third in the final with a time of 22.7 seconds.\n\nIn the 100 meters, Cartmell placed fourth. He won his first round heat and semifinal with times of 11.0 and 11.2 seconds, respectively. He ran the final in 11.0 seconds.\n\nWhile at the 1908 Olympics, Cartmell reportedly got into a fight with a policeman who \"thrust himself into [Cartmell's] face and jabbered something\". In response, Cartmell took the policeman's hand, pushed him and then ran off knowing that the policeman could not catch him on foot. Later, the police showed up at the hotel where the track team for the U.S. team was staying and arrested Charles Hollaway, another member of the team that looked like Cartmell. Cartmell later found out about the mistaken arrest and tried to do something about it, but by the time Cartmell got to the police station Hollaway had already been bailed out and nothing more became of it.\n\nCartmell came to UNC in 1909 as a track-and-field coach for the Tar Heels. In 1910, student Marvin Rich along with certain school officials helped lobby to create a varsity basketball squad at UNC. There was no coach for this basketball program, and UNC did not have enough money at the time to hire another full-time coach for this sport. Cartmell was asked to be the first coach even though he did not know much about the sport. Cartmell coached his first college basketball game on January 27, 1910 when UNC's varsity basketball team played in their first intercollegiate basketball game in Bynum Gymnasium against Virginia Christian College, which later became Lynchburg College. The Tar Heels won their first game 42–21. The Tar Heels would end their first season with a 7–4 record.\n\nIn 1914, Cartmell was charged with illegally playing dice with known gamblers and was fired after the 1914 season. He would be replaced by Charles Doak.\n\nCartmell went on to coach track and sometimes basketball at West Virginia University, Princeton University, Fordham University, Manhattan College and LaSalle Military Academy. He also coached track and field and cross country at Penn State from 1923 to 1933 before ending his career at the United States Military Academy in 1956. Recognized as one of the most respected athletes and coaches of his era, Nathaniel John Cartmell died in his home in New York City on August 23, 1967.\n\nCartmell served as the track coach at his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n"}

His father John was the fifth Manhattan Borough president in 1909 and also New York City's Commissioner of Public Works.\n\nCloughen attended Morris High School in the Bronx, where he was a member of the football, baseball and basketball teams as well as Treasurer of the Athletic Association. While at Morris, he was also an early member of the Delta Chapter of the Omega Gamma Delta Fraternity, of which his father became an Honorary Member and Adult Advisor. Subsequent to high school he attended Fordham University, New York University and the Savage School of Physical Education.\n\n\"Bobbie\" was initially turned down for the 1908 U. S. Olympic team; worked his way to Europe on a tramp steamer; and was accepted as an additional team member on the spot. Cloughen won the silver medal in the 200 m at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London. His preliminary heat time was 23.4 seconds; he dropped to 22.6 seconds to win his semifinal. In the final, Cloughen came from behind to nearly catch Robert Kerr on the straightaway; he lost by about nine inches as both finished in 22.6 seconds. Cloughen also competed in the 100 m in 1908, winning his first round heat with a time of 11.0 seconds before not starting in the semifinal round.\n\nAlso in 1908, Cloughen won the National A.A.U junior championship 100 yard sprint, with a time of 10.2 seconds. At the indoor A.A.U championships the same year, Cloughen won the 60 yard and 75 yard races, equaling the existing records and establishing himself as \"one of the best sprinters in the United States.\"\n\nIn 1909, Cloughen ran 130 yards in 12.8 seconds, establishing a new world's record.\n\nIn 1910, Cloughen broke the world's record for the 110 yard dash at the Tailtin Games held at Celtic Park, Queens, New York, with a time of 10.8 seconds. \"Cloughen jumped into the lead at the start of the 110-yard dash, and led all the way winning by two yards from John Eller in the remarkably fast time of 0:10 4–5. Billy Keating, another of Lawson Robertson's team (the Irish American Athletic Club), finished a close third.\"\n\nIn 1922, Cloughen was named track coach at the University of Vermont. From Vermont he returned to New York as track coach at Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn from 1926 to 1930. Robert Cloughen died in August 1930 while training for an Olympic comeback.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2033943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033943", "title": "John Garrels", "text": "John Garrels\n\nJohn Carlyle \"Johnny\" Garrels (November 18, 1885 – October 21, 1956) was an American athlete who excelled in the 110 metres hurdles, discus throw, shot put, and as a fullback and end in American football.\n\nGarrels won the silver medal in the men's 110 metres hurdles and a bronze medal in the shot put at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London. On at least four occasions, he broke world's records in the discus throw and 110 metres hurdles, though the Amateur Athletic Union declined to recognize the record on each occasion. He was also a starting left end and fullback for the 1904, 1905, and 1906 Michigan Wolverines football teams.\n\nIn 1911, the famed trainer and U.S. Olympic track and field coach Mike Murphy rated Garrels as one of the four athletes in the preceding 30 years \"who towered head and shoulders above any other athletes of their time.\" In 1932, Keene Fitzpatrick, who trained multiple Olympic gold medalists, called Garrels the best all-around athlete he ever handled.\n\nAfter retiring from athletics, Garrels worked as a chemical engineer. He was a technical director at Wyandotte Chemical Company for 27 years. He died in 1956 at Grosse Ile Township, Michigan.\n\nGarrels was born in Bay City, Michigan in 1885. His father was a printer. He attended Central High School in Detroit, Michigan, serving as class president.\n\nIn March 1903, Garrels won the all-round indoor championship of the YMCA at a meet held in Detroit. At age 17, Garrels scored 21 points at the meet with first place finishes in the fence vault (6 feet, 9 inches), running high kick (9 feet), hop, step and jump (27 feet, 5 inches), and second place finishes in the shot put and running high jump.\n\nGarrels enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1903 and received a degree in chemical engineering in 1907. While attending Michigan, Garrels became one of the most accomplished athletes in the university's history. He excelled as a member of Michigan's football teams from 1904 to 1906 and as a member of its track and field team from 1904 to 1907. He was also a member of the Tau Beta Pi fraternity and the Michigamua and Vulcan societies at Michigan.\n\nIn April 1904, Garrels, while still a freshman, demonstrated his ability by throwing the discus \"around 118 and 119 feet\"—a distance that would have won the event at the prior week's Philadelphia meet. Garrels announced at the time that he intended to make a specialty of the discus throw.\n\nIn April 1905, while competing at a meet in Philadelphia, Garrels threw the discus a distance of 135 feet and one-half inch, which exceeded the established world record of 128 feet, 10-1/2 inches. However, AAU officials ruled that the discus used by Garrels \"did not comply strictly with AAU regulations.\" (The discus used by Garrels had an aluminum rim, but complied with the regulations in all other respects.) Two months later, when Garrels competed at the Western Conference track meet in Chicago, he took care to ensure that the discus he used complied with all regulations in the opinion of the officials present at the meet. At that meet, Garrels threw the discus 140 feet, 2-3/8 inches, shattering the old world record by nearly 12 feet. Officials at the meet listed the toss as a new world record, but AAU officials again rejected the record, contending that \"the discus used was not constructed on the official lines laid down by the A.A.U.\" The \"Detroit Free Press\" wrote that the AAU was a \"discredited\" organization and led its coverage of the ruling with a headline declaring, \"GARRELS AGAIN ROBBED OF HONORS, A.A.U. REFUSING WORLD'S RECORD.\"\n\nAt the Western Conference meet in June 1906, Garrels won 18 points -- \"more than any whole college team outside of Michigan and Chicago.\" At the 1906 conference meet, Garrels equaled the world's record in the 120-yard hurdles, but AAU officials ruled that his time would not qualify for the world record, as he had displaced two hurdles during the race. Under the AAU rules in effect at the time, all hurdles must be standing at the end of the race. Garrels' time did qualify, however, as a new Western Conference record. Following the 1906 conference meet, Garrels was elected captain of the 1907 track team.\n\nAt the 1907 Eastern Intercollegiate meet in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Garrels scored 13 points by winning the high hurdles in world record time (15-1/5 seconds), and also winning the low hurdles (24 seconds) and placing second in the shot put (45 feet, 2 inches). His point total was the highest of any athlete at the meet. However, the executive committee of the AAU later ruled that the mark would not qualify as a world record, because the wind was at his back. The \"Detroit Free Press\" noted, \"For a world-beater, Garrels has been unlucky in official recognition.\"\n\nIn 1932, long-time Michigan and Princeton track coach Keene Fitzpatrick, who trained multiple Olympic gold medalists, called Garrels the best all-around athlete he ever handled.\n\nGarrels also played for Fielding H. Yost's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1904 to 1906.\n\nAs a sophomore, Garrels was the starting left end in six of ten games for the undefeated 1904 \"Point-a-Minute\" team that outscored its opponents 567–22.\n\nAs a junior, Garrels started all 13 games as the left end for the 1905 \"Point-a-Minute\" team that outscored opponents 495–2. Garrels was the third leading scorer on the 1905 team (behind Tom Hammond and Joe Curtis) with seven touchdowns and eight extra point kicks for a total of 43 points. Michigan's sole setback in 1905 was a 2–0 loss to the University of Chicago team. Garrels had the longest run of the game, a 35-yard run around Chicago's left end. Garrels was stopped by Chicago All-American Walter Eckersall. The \"Detroit Free Press\" wrote: \"Had there been interference near enough to brush off Eckersall, Michigan would have scored an easy touchdown and victory.\" At the end of the 1905 season, the \"Detroit Free Press\" rated him as the \"Star of Yost's Grid Warriors,\" adding, \"If there was a man who stood out prominently, it was Johnnie Garrels.\"\n\nAs a senior, Garrels was moved to the fullback position, starting all six games at the position for the 1906 Michigan Wolverines football team that finished the season with a record of 4–1. Michigan easily won its first three games in 1906 against Case (28–0), Ohio State (6–0) and Illinois (28–9). The game against Case marked the first game at Ferry Field, and Garrels scored the Wolverines' first touchdown in the new stadium. He also returned the opening kickoff 95 yards against Illinois.\n\nIn the fourth game of the 1906 season, Michigan narrowly defeated Vanderbilt by a score of 10–4. Garrels accounted for nine of Michigan's ten points with a field goal from the 25-yard line in the first half and a touchdown run that has been reported as either 65 or 75 yards on a fake punt in the second half. Following the Vanderbilt game, \"The Pittsburg Press\" wrote:\n\nGarrels is the best fullback in the West, and probably has no equal in the country. Weighing 200 pounds, he is a wonderfully speedy runner, capable of covering the 100 yards in 10 seconds. He is a fine punter, place and drop kicker, tackles well, and is a great line plunger.\n\nIn his final game for Michigan's football team, the Wolverines lost 17-0 to Penn. The Wolverines had lost their captain, Joe Curtis, the week before the Penn game. With Curtis out of the lineup, Penn's efforts were concentrated on Garrels, and \"his every attempt at an end run or a fake kick\" were stopped. Despite the loss, Garrels was credited with playing a \"star game,\" as the \"Detroit Free Press\" observed, \"The sum and substance of the failure of Garrels to do much today was the great playing of Pennsylvania's ends and the almost total lack of interference by the Michigan halfbacks for him.\"\n\nAfter graduating from Michigan in 1907, Garrels trained with the Chicago Athletic Association in preparation for the 1908 Summer Olympics.\n\nIn May 1908, as the Olympic trials approached, sports reporter H.V. Valentine wrote, \"No figure in the world of athletics is attracting more attention these days than that of John G. [sic] Garrles, the great all around athlete of the University of Michigan.\" Another reporter noted, \"Garrels is undoubtedly the best all around man the middle west has ever produced. He can hurdle, jump and toss the weights and is sure to gather points for America in the many events in which he can make a strong showing.\" \"The Pittsburg Press\" called Garrels \"one of the greatest athletes ever developed in the history of manly sports in America.\" Even Martin Sheridan (a five-time Olympic gold medalist) opined, \"He's the greatest all-around athlete in our country -- that's what I think of him. Some day I hope to meet him, and, win or lose, that will be the greatest day of my life.\"\n\nIn early June 1908, the U.S. Olympic Committee announced its selections to compete in the 1908 summer games in London. Garrels was selected to compete for the United States in the 110-meter hurdles, discus, Greek discus and shot put.\n\nIn late June 1908, days before sailing for London, Garrels competed at the AAU meet in Pittsburgh. Garrels took first place in the 110-meter hurdles (15-3/5 seconds), the discus throw (132 feet, 8 inches) and the shot put (42 feet, 10 inches). He also finished in second place in the 100-meter race.\n\nOn June 27, 1908, Garrels set sail from New York to London aboard the \"Philadelphia\" as part of the 78-member American track team led by the famed trainer and coach Mike Murphy.\n\nGarrels was selected to carry the American flag at the opening ceremonies in London. On July 13, 1908, he led the American delegation into the Olympic stadium at Shepherd's Bush before King Edward VII and Queen Alexandria.\n\nGarrels began his Olympic competition with the shot put competition on July 16, 1908. He finished third in the event, as fellow American (and former University of Michigan athlete) Ralph Rose took the gold medal. The discus throw was held on the same day, and Garrels failed to finish among the leaders. Fellow American Martin Sheridan took the gold medal in the event. On July 18, 1908, Garrels also competed in the Greek discus, and again he did not place among the leaders. Competing in his fourth event, Garrels took the silver medal in the 110-meter hurdles, finishing second behind fellow American Forrest Smithson who set a new world record with a time of 15.0 seconds. Following Smithson's surprise victory over Garrels, one press account noted:\n\nJ. C. Garrels, the great University of Michigan athlete, was regarded as unbeatable in this event by the members of the American team, and Smithson's feat of beating him by two yards is something which must mark him as perhaps the greatest athlete turned out in America this season. Until this race Garrels has never been defeated in the high hurdles.\n\nUpon their return from London, Garrels and other members of the American Olympic team were the guests of President Theodore Roosevelt at Oyster Bay.\n\nIn 1911, Mike Murphy was asked to rank the best athletes he had seen in his 30 years working with track and field athletes. Murphy rated Garrels as one of the four athletes (along with Lon Myers, Harry Jewett and Alvin Kraenzlein) \"who towered head and shoulders above any other athletes of their time.\"\n\nGarrels was employed in the chemical industry for many years after retiring from athletics. He was a technical director at Wyandotte Chemical Company (acquired by BASF in 1969) for 27 years. Garrels died in 1956 at age 70.\n\nGarrels was married to Margaret Anne Garrels. They resided in Grosse Ile Township, Michigan, where they raised three children. Their son Robert Garrels (1916-1988) was a noted geochemist.\n\nIn 2009, Garrels was posthumously inducted into the Michigan Track and Field Hall of Fame.\n"}

The school building consists of the hall, the laboratory wing, the classroom wing, and the new wing (completed in 2003). Ms. Tang Suk Ching is the current principal of the school, beginning her term in September 2016.\n\nThe school was founded in 1961, as the earliest secondary school in the Tsuen Wan District. Today it is recognised as one of the leading schools in Hong Kong in terms of academic results.\n11 September 1961 was a memorable day to TWGSS. On that day, TWGSS opened. The first campus site was in the newly established Hoi Pa Street Government Primary School, where sixty-eight boys and seventy-five girls were accommodated temporarily. In September 1963, however, due to the lack of classrooms available for S1-S3 levels, the school was separated into A.M. and P. M. session. 25 June 1964 was another meaningful day to our school because on that day, old boys and girls moved to the new campus and thus the whole-day school arrangement resumed.\n\nThe opening ceremony of TWGSS was held on 25 November 1964. His Excellency the Governor, Sir David Trench, was invited to be the Guest of Honour to mark the opening of the school. A historical plaque of the grand opening ceremony can be found on the wall of the main lobby. It reads: \"The school opened by His Excellency The Governor Sir David C.C. Trench K.C.M.G., M.C. on 25th November 1964.\"\n\nTwo survivors of the 2010 Manila hostage crisis, who were orphaned by the tragedy, were students of the school.\n\nWhere once were swamps, Tsuen Wan has now arisen\nHere is our school, and large our spirit grows\nThese walls do not our hearts or minds imprison\nBecause our school (as e'en the youngest knows)\nTranscends its bounds with ev'ry youthful vision,\nand we are free; Our guide, Integritas.\nPine, Plum, Bamboo and Camphor don't divide us,\nWe all are one; together on our way,\nWith Scout and Guide and Monitor beside us,\nAnd Prefect too, our School we'll not betray.\nIn work and play, at school, at home, and always,\nIn all we do, we'll seek Integritas.\n\nTsuen Wan Government Secondary School students are known for excelling in public examinations.\n\nHistorically, more students at the school have received 10 A grades on the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination (HKCEE) (the highest grade possible on the HKCEE) than at any other secondary schools in Hong Kong. Out of over 572 secondary schools in Hong Kong, fewer than 30 have ever produced these so-called \"10A\" students. In particular, between 2000 and 2010, eight Tsuen Wan Government Secondary School students have received 10 A's in the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination (HKCEE) and 14 students have received 9 A's, ranking ninth among all secondary schools in Hong Kong.\n\nIn the Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination (HKALE), more than 30 students have received 5 A's, 4 A's or 3 A's between 2000 and 2010. The school received a relatively high number of A grades and A-C grades per student.\n\nThe stellar academic performance of the students has been reflected in its representation at many of the world's best universities. Many excellent Form 6 students continue their education at prestigious overseas institutions in the United States, the People's Republic of China and the United Kingdom, while most graduates enrol in prestigious local universities such as the University of Hong Kong, the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\n\nTWGSS counts a total of 12 winners of the Hong Kong Outstanding Students Awards, ranking seventh among all secondary schools in Hong Kong.\n\n31 air-conditioned classrooms and school hall, Audio-Visual Production & Broadcasting Centre, 3 Computer Assisted Learning Centres, Student Activity Centre, laboratories, Geography Room, Music Room, Music Centre, Language room, Home Economics Room, Art Room, Design and Technology Room, library, conference rooms, Lecture Room, badminton court and basketball court.\n\nThere are 4 houses, Bamboo (BA), Camphor (CA), Pine (PI) and Plum (PL). More than 30 clubs and societies of academic, service, sports or other interests are also organised.\n\n\n\n"}

It is located in the municipality of Voždovac.\n\nThe Dušanovac is bounded by the other Belgrade neighbourhoods: Autokomanda to the west, Pašino Brdo to the north, Šumice, Konjarnik, Marinkova Bara, Medaković and Braće Jerković to the east, and Voždovac itself to the south.\n\nAs a pre-World War I suburb of Belgrade, in the area that was eastern border of the city at that time, Dušanovac was administratively part of the municipality of Kumodraž. After the liberation in World War I in 1918, the neighborhood came under Belgrade's administrative rule. It began to develop rapidly in the 1920s and before World War II caught Yugoslavia in 1941, the area was fully urbanized and made continuous urban area with the rest of the city. Despite being a residential settlement on the outskirts of Belgrade, and not having industrial or military facilities, Dušanovac and the neighboring Pašino Brdo were partially demolished during the heavy „Easter bombing“ of Belgrade by the Allies on 16 April 1944.\n\nFrom June 1945 to December 1946, Dušanovac was one of 5 administrative neighborhoods within Belgrade’s Raion VI.\n\nSince the 1960s and 1970s new, vast in area boroughs were developed further to the east, like Šumice and Konjarnik which connected Belgrade in one continuous urban area with former villages of Mali Mokri Lug, Veliki Mokri Lug, Kaluđerica, Leštane, Vinča and Boleč, so today, the Dušanovac is closer to the downtown Belgrade (10 minutes by public bus) than to the eastern outskirts of the city.\n\nDušanovac was always an area with working class population, settled in predominantly small-to-medium houses with backyards. It is mostly residential area without major industrial objects. However, in 1974 a Belgrade-Niš highway was constructed right through the neighbourhood, splitting it in two parts, and along the highway huge car shops, exhibitor's salons, restaurants and other commercial objects are still being built. Located right next to the highway is also an open produce market \"Dušanovačka pijaca\" (Cyrillic: \"Душановачка пијаца\"; \"Market of Dušanovac\"), one of the major ones in Belgrade. \n\nThe population of Dušanovac was 7,301 in 2002 and 6,283 in 2011.\n\nAn area to the north, between the highway and \"Ustanička Street \" (Cyrillic: \"Устаничка\"; Street of the Rebellion(s)) is turned into an administrative center, including the municipal assembly of Voždovac, the police and fire station, the local clinical-ambulance center, the Fifth Municipal Court of Belgrade and the Special section of the Supreme court of Serbia for organized crime and war crimes (formerly the Supreme Military Court of Yugoslavia), or colloquially called the Special Court.\n\nSpecial Court\n\nThe building of the Special Court served as the Supreme Military Court until the military judiciary was abolished. After the assassination of prime minister Zoran Đinđić in 2003, the building was thoroughly renovated and adapted for the trials concerning the organized crime and war crimes. Defense minister of Yugoslavia Boris Tadić handed over the keys to the Serbian justice minister Vladan Batić on 24 October 2003, after the adaptation was completed. The building was transformed by the Italian model of the high risk mafia trials, with the latest generation of the audio-visual-safety equipment, previously unseen in this part of Europe.\n\nThe largest courtroom in the building, Courtroom 1, is also the largest one in the entire Serbia: there are 500 seats in the audience and the dock is large enough for 50 accuseds. Courtroom 2, named after the Italian judge Giovanni Falcone, is smaller, with the dock set for the groups of 10. The building has also a detention unit and the inner parking, accessible via a specially guarded gate and fenced with high walls.\n\nIn August 2018 it was announced that the building will be expanded, with additional . The expansion will actually be a completely new building, adjacent to the old one. It is planned for the Prosecutors office for the organized crime which will move out of the old building leaving it solely to the court business. Works are planned for 2018 and to be finished by 2020 in a 1-1,5 years.\n\nDušanovac is well connected with other parts of the city, by public transportation:\n\nBuses (with connecting areas of the city):\n\n"}

He did little to attract public attention after the end of his political career until, in 1840, he was murdered in his sleep by his valet.\n\nRussell was the posthumous child of Francis Russell, Marquess of Tavistock, eldest son of John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford. He was the youngest brother of Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford, and John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford, and uncle of Francis Russell, 7th Duke of Bedford.\n\nRussell married Lady Charlotte Villiers, eldest daughter of George Bussy Villiers, 4th Earl of Jersey, on 11 July 1789; they had seven children. Lady Charlotte died in 1808. As was mentioned in evidence at the trial of his murderer, Russell had a locket containing some of his wife's hair, which he valued greatly.\n\n\"The Times\", reporting on proceedings where Russell's eligibility to register as a voter in Middlesex and Surrey was challenged in 1836, included the information that he spent much time abroad, living in hotels when in England. However, by 1840 Lord William was residing in the London house where he was murdered.\n\nAs with many members of the Russell family, notably his nephew the future Prime Minister Lord John Russell (who was Colonial Secretary at the time of the murder), Lord William was a Whig politician.\n\nRussell represented the county of Surrey in the House of Commons from 1789 until he was defeated in the 1807 election. Russell held junior ministerial office in the Ministry of all the Talents, being appointed a Lord of the Admiralty in 1806 and retaining the post until the fall of the ministry in 1807.\n\nRussell, taking advantage of the fact that different constituencies polled on different dates, remained in Parliament by being elected for the Russell family pocket borough of Tavistock. He represented that constituency from 1807 until he stood down in 1819, and again from 1826 until he retired from Parliament in 1831.\n\nDuring a brief stay in Venice, Italy in 1821, Russell studied at the San Lazzaro degli Armeni.\n\nLord William continued to support the Whig Party after he left the legislature. \"The Times\" reported in 1837 that few Whigs supported the government at the Great Middlesex Meeting, \"inasmuch as not a man of them, barring the young Lord who had taken the chair, and his aged uncle Lord William Russell, ever showed fight at all\".\n\nOn the morning of 6 May 1840, Russell's housemaid, Sarah Mancer, discovered the lower floors of the house in Norfolk Street (now called Dunraven Street) in disarray. Fearing that a robbery had taken place in the night, she went to the room of the Swiss valet, François Benjamin Courvoisier, and found him already dressed. Upon seeing the state of the house, he agreed that a robbery must have occurred; Courvoisier and Mancer then went to Russell's bedchamber, where Courvoisier immediately began to open the shutters, as he always did. Thus it was Mancer who first noticed that Russell was dead; his throat had been cut. The police were summoned; Courvoisier drew their attention to marks of violence upon the door to his pantry, asserting that this was where the robbers had entered the house.\n\nA provincial doctor, Robert Blake Overton, wrote to Scotland Yard suggesting checking for fingerprints but the suggestion, though followed up, did not lead to routine use of fingerprinting by the police for another 50 years.\n\nThe police, however, came quickly to the conclusion that the \"robbery\" had been staged in order to draw suspicion away from some member of the household. Numerous small gold and silver articles, as well as a ten-pound banknote, were found to be missing; some of the articles were soon discovered wrapped in a parcel inside the house, which was curious – a thief would have carried them off straightaway rather than leave them behind. The discovery of several more gold articles, as well as the banknote, hidden in the wainscoting and in Courvoisier's pantry cemented their suspicion of the valet. Additionally, a screwdriver in his possession was found to match the marks on the pantry door as well as marks left by the forcing of the silverware drawer.\n\nCourvoisier was put on trial, but the question was whether his guilt could be conclusively proven. His counsel, Charles Phillips, was doing well on the paucity of evidence, such as the lack of blood on Courvoisier's clothes, unusual in a cut-throat murder. Phillips was supposed by some to be hinting at the guilt of a maidservant in the house, when an inventory indicated that several further items of silverware were missing, and silver matching their description was located in a French hotel in Leicester Square. Samuel Warren defended Phillips against the charge he had ever imputed guilt to any woman in the house, in his 1855 book, \"The Mystery of Murder, and its Defence\".\n\nThis report was conveyed to Courvoisier by his barrister, and he immediately confessed to both the thefts and the murder. Phillips asked his client if he now planned to change his plea from not guilty to guilty. Courvoisier insisted on maintaining the not guilty plea, and said he expected Phillips to continue the defence on that basis. The legal interest in the case arises from Phillips' approach to the judge for guidance. He was forcefully told he could not ask for such advice, so he continued the defence, knowing that his client was guilty. It led to considerable public criticism of Phillips after the trial, some papers saying he had tried to fix the blame on the maid, although the transcript shows he had specifically disclaimed making any such imputation during the trial. He did expose the fact that a policeman had planted a pair of bloody gloves in the defendant's things.\n\nIt emerged in Courvoisier's confession that Russell had discovered his silverware thefts and ordered Courvoisier to resign from the household. Rather than lose his position, Courvoisier decided to conceal the matter by murdering Russell. The lack of blood on Courvoisier's clothes was then explained; he had committed the crime while naked.\n\nCourvoisier had reportedly read William Harrison Ainsworth's novel \"Jack Sheppard\" in the days leading up to the crime, and several news reports implied that the novel's glorification of criminal life had led him to commit the murder. However, this avenue was not pursued in Courvoisier's court defence.\n\nCourvoisier was publicly hanged outside Newgate Prison on 6 July 1840. Charles Dickens was among the estimated crowd of 40,000 who attended. Also present was the novelist William Makepeace Thackeray, who subsequently wrote an anti-capital punishment essay, \"On Going to See a Man Hanged\". He wrote, \"I came away that morning with a disgust for murder, but it was for the murder I saw done … I feel myself shamed and degraded at the brutal curiosity that took me to that spot.\" \nSoon afterwards the murder scene was portrayed in a peep-show at a travelling fair.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n\n"}

The descendants of these immigrants, in the early 19th Century, populated the region of Itapema, giving its first administrative structure, on December 30, 1914, with the creation of its Police District.\n\nIt is known that in 1852, it was assumed that some 980 Portuguese and Azorean descendants already lived in areas of the current municipality of Itapema. This figure refers to the number of 51 mills of cassava flour and sugar. It was very common for families to have both types of mills.\n\nDemographic growth until the mid-nineteenth century was slow. From the end of this century, Itapema receives immigrants of German, Italian and Spanish origin who soon end up merging with the population of Azorean origin. These other peoples exercise little local cultural influence, since the festivities, such as the feast of the patroness - Our Lady of the Navigators - besides the games, such as Farra do Boi, Boi-de-Mamão and Cantorias do Terno-de-Reis and festivals of the Divine were brought and maintained by the Azoreans.\n\nThe first denomination of Itapema was Vila de Santo Antônio de Lisboa or Tapera, term that was related to the model of their dwellings. Its economy was based on subsistence, being fishing on the coast, besides the planting of cassava and the production of flour, allied to the culture of other products such as corn, beans, coffee, rice and watermelon.\n\nDuring the district phase, Itapema was incorporated in the city of Camboriú, from 1923 to 1925. With the population growth in the first half of the twentieth century, as well as economic importance, Itapema falls within the conditions to be considered a municipality in 1962. On January 31 of that same year, the first mayor elected in Itapema, Olegário Bernardes, was elected.\n\nSince the 1980s, there has been a significant growth in the country's housing sector. In line with what happens on a national scale, Itapema also presents an expansion of this sector, resulting in significant changes in the local landscape, linked to an acceleration of tourist flows, placing the municipality in the spotlight in the Santa Catarina scenario.\n\nItapema can be accessed from highway BR-101 and it is surrounded by a rocky coastline. It's located on the north-central coast of Santa Catarina state. The city has waterfalls and hill. The vegetation is composed by vegetation of restinga and Atlantic forest.\n\nFive hundred thousand square meters of civil construction projects were built in Itapema between 2003 and 2005.\n\nItapema is the third most popular tourist destination in Santa Catarina. The beaches are the biggest tourist attraction and the Meia Praia, or Middle Beach of Itapema, is the longest. Itapema has six beaches: Canto da Praia, Costão, Meia Praia, Ilhota, Central and Praia Grossa.\n\nKnown as the Ultralight Capital, Itapema has annually the Ultralight Encounter is held in the city, the event is a success and attracts thousands of aviation fans. The Pilots Association of Itapema prepares several surprises for the day of the meeting, such as radical maneuvers, aircraft exhibitions, flight raffles, acrobatics, parachuting, aeromodelling, flying over the city, among other attractions.\n"}

It escorted the President of Ireland on state occasions, most famously to and from presidential inaugurations between 1938, when the first president took office, and 1948 when the Escort was disbanded.\n\nNewsreel footage from 1934 shows the Blue Hussars escorting the remains of the U.S. Diplomatic Representative to the Free State.\n\nThe name \"Blue Hussars\" is sometimes also used to refer to their successors, the motorcycle unit (2 Cavalry Squadron) of the Cavalry Corps that has provided presidential escorts since 1948.\n\nIn 1931 a decision was taken to provide a Mounted Escort for state and ceremonial functions. This escort first appeared in public in 1932 to form a guard of honour for the Papal Legate visiting Ireland for the 1932 Eucharistic Congress. They were used subsequently to provide an escort for the President of the Executive Council (prime minister).\n\nA uniform was originally designed by a committee that included Irish artist Seán Keating, consisting of a saffron léine (a form of tunic) with six rows of black braid and black cuffs, a blue \"brat\" (a fringed medieval shawl/cloak), tight pantaloons and a black Balmoral cap with saffron feather. For reasons that remain unknown, the original designs for the uniforms were not adopted. \n\nThe uniform design finally selected and produced for the unit consisted of tunic and breeches in a rich sapphire blue (officially alizarine sapphire) with gold frogging and lace of the near-standard international hussar pattern and black sealskin busbies with orange-yellow plumes. \n\nContemporary rumour suggested (incorrectly) that these distinctive hussar-style uniforms, which gave the unit its nickname, had been found in a cupboard in Dublin Castle in 1932 and dated back to British rule in Ireland. The story was that, rather than throw them out, the uniforms were used to dress up the army unit escorting the legate. While however the designs of the uniforms used were based upon British garments, files in the National Archives of Ireland show that £2,165 was spent on purchasing the seventy uniforms used by the escort. The basic pattern was identical to that of the 8th (King's Royal Irish) Hussars, but the bright blue colour differed from the dark blue of British hussar regiments.\n\nThe Mounted Escort had a total of eighty horses. The Escort consisted of an advance guard of two, a single connecting file, two flanking riders, and two troops of thirty.\n\nThe bulk of the personnel comprising the Escort were drawn from the Artillery Corps, which in the 1930s was the only branch of the Irish Defence Forces employing horses in any numbers. The Escort was not permanently embodied but was brought together for public duties and rehearsals as required. In addition to ceremonial duties, the Escort performed at horse shows and gymkhanas.\n\nThe creation of the presidency of Ireland in 1937 led to a decision to transfer the Blue Hussars exclusively to presidential ceremonial. Most notably they escorted President Seán T. O'Kelly, who travelled to the 1945 inauguration in the late Queen Alexandra's horse-drawn landau, the first (and only) time when a president went to his or her inauguration in a horse-drawn carriage rather than a car.\n\nIn 1947, however, following a carriage incident at the Dublin Horse Show at the Royal Dublin Society the government of Éamon de Valera decided to abandon the use of carriages for Irish presidents. The following year the First Inter-Party Government decided to disband the Mounted Escort also, even though between 1938 and 1945 the Escort had escorted presidents as they travelled by car. The Minister for Defence argued that motorcycles would be \"more impressive\" than Irish horses.\n\nPatrick McGilligan, the Minister for Finance who successfully pushed for their abolition, defended his action in Seanad Éireann by saying\n\nWithin the Irish army, their disbanding was blamed on a lack of suitable horses, a claim critics ridiculed given that Ireland was and is famed for its horses. This has the current result that, while crossbred Irish Draught and Thoroughbred horses are the mounts used by the British Household Cavalry for state and royal occasions, Ireland imports motorbikes to fulfill that role in its own ceremonial.\n\nThough the Blue Hussars were officially disbanded in 1948, 2 Cavalry Squadron took over their role and for a time was equipped with blue Honda motorcycles in honour of their predecessors. Due to this link, the unit was on occasion nicknamed the \"Blue Hussars\".\n\n\n"}

The first emerged in 1139 and became closely associated with the County of Sponheim early in its existence. Count Henry II was notable for being accused of satanic orgies by the Church's German Grand Inquisitor, Conrad von Marburg, in 1233. Henry was acquitted by an assembly of bishops in Mainz, but Conrad refused to accept the verdict and left Mainz. It is unknown whether it was Henry's Knights which killed Conrad on his return to Thuringia, but investigation was foregone due to the cruelty of Conrad, despite Pope Gregory IX ordering his murderers to be punished. With the death of Henry in 1246, the County passed to the Counts of Sponheim-Eberstein and thence to Sponheim-Sayn in 1261.\n\nThe second County of Sayn emerged as a partition of Sponheim-Sayn in 1283 (the other partition being Sayn-Homburg). It was notable for its numerous co-reigns, and it endured until 1608 when it was inherited by the Counts of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn. A lack of clear heirs of William III of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn led to the temporary annexation of the comital territories by the Archbishop of Cologne until the succession was decided. In 1648 following the Thirty Years' War, the County was divided between Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn-Altenkirchen and Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hachenburg.\n\n\n\n"}

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Čukarica.\n\nŽarkovo (Greater Žarkovo) is one of the most populous single neighborhoods of Belgrade. As such, it is divided in several sub-neighborhoods, which were built as Žarkovo's extensions: Julino Brdo and Repište to the north, Cerak-Cerak II to the west and Bele Vode and Rupčine to the south.\n\nIn general, Greater Žarkovo is bordered by the Čukarica, Banovo Brdo and Sunčana Padina to the north, Košutnjak (with Filmski Grad) to the east, Skojevsko Naselje and Cerak Vinogradi to the northeast and Makiš to the west. On the south, it is bordered by the open fields of \"Stari Lanci\", \"Novi Lanci\" and \"Rupčine\", but with the urbanized strip of land alongside the Belgrade-Bar railway and the \"Vodovodska Street\" it makes a continuous built-up area with Železnik to the southwest.\n\nThe village was named Belo Vrelo (White Water Spring). It was mentioned for the first time under its present name in 1523, in Ottoman defter. Žarkovo got its name after Žarko. \"Primićur\" was a title, Slavic version of the German word \"kramar\", chief of the military guard which escorted trade caravans. Also, there is a folk legend about the name. A daredevil hero Žarko killed an evil dragon who harassed the villagers. From dragon's tail, which Žarko cut off, emerged the Zmajevac stream (\"zmaj\", Serbian for dragon). Urbanized area around the stream is also called Zmajevac and is today one of the sub-neighborhoods of Žarkovo.\n\nThe remains of the large Neolithic settlement from the period of the Vinča culture is found in the area (Cerak Vinogradi). \n\nŽarkovo was granted self-administration in 1839, and on 2 July 1856 the municipality was formed. According to the records of the day, the municipality was bordered by the right bank of the Sava river, left bank of the Topčiderka river, and by the territories of the Kneževac, Železnik and Ostružnica villages. Žarkovo municipality was more important than the village of Čukarica, which split from it as a separate municipality on 21 December 1911 by the \"ukaz\" of King Peter I of Serbia, and territorially cut off Žarkovo from both rivers.\n\nŽarkovo was considered to be a wealthy village, known for its dairy. In 1936, Žarkovo produced 14,000 litres of milk daily for the Belgrade markets. The surrounding area was known for fertile land and with the large market of the nearby Belgrade for the farmers' products, farmers and craftsmen families in Žarkovo turned affluent. The village had a cinema, culture center, municipal and administrative building, etc. Municipality of Žarkovo was abolished in July 1955 and it was annexed to the municipality of Čukarica. A direct line of the Belgrade public transportation, No. 31, connected Žarkovo to downtown Belgrade, at the Republic Square.\n\nUntil the 1970s, Žarkovo was a suburb of Belgrade, a separate, extremely fast growing town (population 1961: 8,636; 1971: 28,761), so it was administratively annexed to the Belgrade City proper, becoming \"local community\" within the city, and an extensive development of the border neighborhoods in the 1970s and 1980s (Banovo Brdo, Sunčana Padina, Cerak Vinogradi, Skojevsko Naselje), connected Žarkovo and the rest of Belgrade into one continuous built-up area. In 1981 local community of Žarkovo had a population of 43,721, which was already 40% of the population in the urban section of the Čukarica municipality. Later, the local community was divided into several smaller ones, but the population of Žarkovo in widest sense was 71,773 in 2002. Čukarica municipality recreated local community of Žarkovo, which included Julino Brdo and Bele Vode but without Cerak. Žarkovo had a population of 30,979 in 2011 (with Cerak, 74,972).\n\nThe Old School building was constructed in 1840 as both the school and the seat of the village administration. In 1880 the administration moved out, and the school, later named \"Ljuba Nenadović\", continued until 1968 when it was moved into another building. The old building was declared a cultural monument in 1965, but was left to the elements since the pupils moved out. By the 2010s, it was totally neglected and desolate. The school was built from solid materials, with a simple design of a modest, standardized architectural \"box\" style. It had two classrooms and several smaller auxiliary rooms, including the teacher's quarters. The ground-floor object has a cellar beneath a part of the roof, which is four-gabled and covered with flat tiles.\n\nThe old , large two-storey building, which was the administrative seat of the municipality, was built in 1921. At the plateau next to the building, there was a monument dedicated to the fallen heroes in World War II, but was later moved nest to the \"Ljuba Nenadović\" elementary school. After it lost its administrative purpose in 1955, it hosted pharmacy, bakery and finally a library. It wasn't maintained well and became crumbly. The building was demolished in 1986, during the complete overhaul of the Trgovačka Street, central street in the neighborhood. Big, glass-plated shopping mall was built instead, and as the commercial facilities spread around it, it is today the busiest part of Žarkovo and a major crossroad of numerous public transportation and intercity bus lines. The locality is today known as the Žarkovo Center.\n\nWith only , Žarkovo's \"Lovačka\" street is officially the shortest street in Belgrade.\n\nŽarkovo Selo (Serbian for \"Žarkovo village\") or Old Žarkovo, is the oldest part of Žarkovo. Urbanized today, with its small houses with backyards and short streets, it still distinct itself from the rest of the modern, tall buildings in the neighborhood. It had a population of 4,219 in 1981 (9,6% of the whole population of Žarkovo) and 7,625 in 2002 (10,6%).\n\nŽarkovo is mostly residential area. Western part of the neighborhood, alongside the \"Milorada Jovanovića Street\" is industrialized though, so as the area on the Makiš-Bele Vode border (freight train station and a marshalling yard on the Belgrade-Bar railway, the largest one in Belgrade, and the central facilities (including the water factory) of the Belgrade waterworks). Military Technical Institute Belgrade (former Aeronautical Technical Institute) is located in the Žarkovo's extensions Bele Vode.\n\nThe main street in Žarkovo, the \"Trgovačka Street\" is developing into a new commercial center, as an extension of the major commercial center and the main street of Banovo Brdo, the \"Požeška Street\". \"Trgovačka Street\" itself extends into the major road in western Serbia, the \"Ibarska magistrala\".\n\n\n"}

He joined Juventus on a free transfer in the summer of 2004, but he struggled to adapt to life in Turin and did not play much as he was behind Pavel Nedvěd in the left midfield role. As a result, he was loaned to Monaco for the 2005–06 season.\n\nWhen Juventus were forcibly relegated to Serie B, Kapo returned to Turin, but went back on loan due to the abundance of midfielders.

His younger brother Alan Watson West Cilento (born 1908) became General Manager of the Savings Bank of South Australia from 1961 to 1968. He was educated at Prince Alfred College, but although he was determined from an early age to study medicine, he was initially thwarted in doing so due to lack of money. Therefore, he trained first as a school teacher, sponsored by the Education Department, from 1908 and taught at Port Pirie in 1910 and 1911. He eventually entered the University of Adelaide Medical School on borrowed funds, but while there he won so many scholarships and other prizes that he ended his course with a respectable bank balance.\n\nFor the earlier part of his working life, Cilento's interests were mainly in public health and, specifically, tropical medicine. He served with the Australian Army's Tropical Force in New Guinea which superseded the German administration after the First World War. Later he joined the British colonial service in Malaya.\n\nOn his return to Australia he was Director of the Australian Institute of Tropical Medicine in Townsville, Queensland, from 1922 to 1924.\n\nFollowing a further term in New Guinea, he became Director of the Commonwealth Government's Division of Tropical Hygiene in Brisbane. He held that role from 1928 to 1934.\n\nIn 1934 Queensland's Forgan Smith Government set out to create one of the world's first universally free public health systems, and then Minister for Health, Ned Hanlon, recruited Dr Raphael Cilento to achieve this goal as Director-General of Health and Medical Services. Cilento, despite his subsequent identification with the political right wing, never lost his belief in government-funded health care. To assist in his policy-making objectives, he studied law and was admitted to the Bar in 1939.\n\nAs Director-General (a position he held till 1945), and combined with the presidency of the state's Medical Board (as well as with the medicine professorship at the University of Queensland), he firmly opposed the anti-polio methods of Elizabeth Kenny, although at first he had spoken politely enough of her work to give the impression that he favoured it.\n\nCilento was knighted by King George V in 1935 (when only 42 years old) for his contributions to public service and tropical medicine. He achieved international fame after World War II for his work in aiding refugees with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. In July 1945 he was the first civilian doctor to enter Belsen concentration camp, after doing considerable work on malaria control in The Balkans. He was Director for Refugees and Displaced Persons from 1946 to 1947, and from 1948 was director of disaster relief in Palestine but resigned in 1950 after expressing sympathy with dispossessed Palestinian refugees. He returned to Australia in 1951.\n\nHis later life in his native land was characterised by frustration at being unable to find appropriate employment in government service or academia. This failure was at least partly the consequence of his increasingly racist and ultra-conservative views, exemplified by his involvement with the Australian League of Rights during the 1950s and 1960s in particular, and his continued public support for the White Australia Policy long after this doctrine had ceased to be part of the Australian party-political mainstream. Professor Mark Finnane of Griffith University has written in the journal Queensland Review that \"[m]uch of his brilliance, energetically applied to the development of sound research and policy in the control and eradication of tropical diseases, was directed also to applying the developing techniques of epidemiology and tropical medicine in the service of ideas about racial hierarchies which had a firm basis in the nineteenth century. These ideas eventually would be discredited by the history as well as science unfolding from the 1920s, but even so Cilento hung on to them well past their waning. Into the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, he was still writing about the white man in the tropics and racial vitality in ways that ensured his reputation for good work in other domains would struggle to survive his own monomania.\"\n\nIn a letter in The Courier-Mail (18 May 1965) on Australian clergy's attitude to the Vietnam War he said 'I am not a practising Christian – I am sorry for it ... I regret that I have not the gift of faith'.\n\nHe died on 15 April 1985 in the Brisbane suburb of Oxley and was survived by his wife and six children. Although he had been married in a Church of England service, he was brought up Catholic and was buried with Catholic rites at Pinnaroo Lawn Cemetery.\n\nIn 1918, whilst they were both studying medicine at the University of Adelaide, he became engaged to, and on 18 March 1920 at St Columba's Church of England, Hawthorn he married, Dr Phyllis McGlew, who also became a well-known medical practitioner and medical writer. They briefly set up in general practice in Tranmere before departing for Malaya in October.\n\nTogether they had three sons and three daughters. The three sons and Ruth became medical practitioners, Margaret became an artist, and Diane became an actress.\n\n\nSir Raphael Cilento's publications include:\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation between 1994 and 1996 under the ring name Duke \"The Dumpster\" Droese.\n\nDroese was trained as a professional wrestler by Bobby Wales. He debuted in Miami, Florida in February 1990, defeating Johnny Blade in his first match. Droese wrestled on the Florida independent circuit throughout the early 1990s. In 1993, Droese wrestled under the name \"Garbage Man\", which was the inspiration for the gimmick he took the following year in the World Wrestling Federation. Before being signed to the WWF, Droese also wrestled under the ring name Rocco Gibraltar. Droese first came to national wrestling attention in 1993 thanks to \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\"s annual PWI 500 (top 500 wrestlers in the world) where he was placed at #500. Throughout the first part of his tour with the WWE, Droese was accompanied to the ring by many fans chanting \"500\".\n\nIn 1994, Droese was signed to a contract by the World Wrestling Federation. Droese was given the gimmick Duke \"The Dumpster\" Droese, a garbage man who carried a trash can to the ring. He debuted on Monday Night Raw defeating Barry Horowitz on May 23. In the summer of 1994 as an opponent for color commentator Jerry Lawler. In the course of a confrontation with Lawler, Droese was struck in the head with his own can, one of the first instances of hardcore wrestling on \"WWF Monday Night Raw\". Lawler was obliged to apologize legitimately for \"demonstrating such a brutal amount of violence\".\n\nDroese took part in the 1995 Royal Rumble and the 1995 King of the Ring, but did not win at either event. Later in 1995, Droese began feuding with Hunter Hearst Helmsley (later known as Triple H). At the 1996 Royal Rumble, Droese handed Helmsley his first WWF loss by disqualification in a match with the stipulation that the winner would enter the Royal Rumble match at number 30, while the loser would be obliged to enter at number one. Despite entering at number 30, Droese failed to win the Royal Rumble, and was eliminated by Diesel and Kama. The feud between Droese and Helmsley intensified on the January 27, 1996 edition of Superstars, when Helmsley attacked Droese after his match and cut off his hair. The feud culminated in a match that Helmsley won at In Your House 6 on February 18. Droese left the WWF in the summer of 1996, when he and Vince McMahon mutually agreed on a contract release due to the toll that extensive touring was taking on Droese. His final televised match was aired on the July 13, 1996 edition of \"Superstars\", a loss to T.L. Hopper.\n\nIn 1997, Droese appeared with the Germany based Catch Wrestling Association under the ring name Marshall Duke. On August 16 in Vienna, Austria, Droese defeated Ulf Herman to win the vacant CWA World Heavyweight Championship.

{"id": "2034034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2034034", "title": "Kessen", "text": "Kessen\n\nIt is a real-time tactics game set in feudal Japan, focusing upon a conflict between the eastern Tokugawa clan and western Toyotomi clan (with Ishida Mitsunari as the Toyotomi's guardian and protector) shogunates at the end of Sengoku Jidai. Tokugawa Ieyasu served as the primary representative for the Eastern forces where the Western army changed leaders based on the results of select key battles.\n\nAlthough it was, for the most part, historically accurate, the game contained a number of \"what-if\" scenarios, for example, if the Western forces are victorious at the Battle of Sekigahara (historically an Eastern victory).\n\nTwo sequels were later created, \"Kessen II\" and \"Kessen III\". These two games introduced magical and meteorological elements to the games.\n\nA note from the game's producer, Kou Shibusawa, addressed to players before any campaign begins, explains his desire to take his own twist on this segment of history but felt too constricted by cinema to do so properly. With \"Kessen\", he believes that he was able to explore his ideas more freely. Thus, several of the game's cutscenes have a theatrical feel similar to \"chanbara\" and \"jidaigeki\" films.\n\nBefore each campaign begins, a narrator enlists a brief summary of the events proceeding the selected campaign to help familiarize players with the battle taking place. After the pre-planning of the battle is finished, a cinematic event occurs, often dramatizing character interactions or significant historical events that took place before the battle occurs. Similar events also occur after the war council, during battle, and at the battle's end.\n\nAmong the historically accurate retelling of events, preference for the often romanticized accounts were sometimes used. Notable instances include Hosokawa Gracia ordering a soldier to kill her and Tokugawa Hidetada ordering the assassination of Sanada Masayuki for causing his tardiness at Sekigahara.\n\n\"Kessen\" received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of one nine, one eight, one seven, and one eight, for a total of 32 out of 40.\n\nElsewhere, Jeff Luther from \"GamesFirst!\" noted that the game is easy to pick up, although he felt that it failed to maintain its difficulty level after the initial stages. Others have also described it as redundant and slow. Cutscenes were cited by one critic to be \"the visual appeal to Kessen\". Graphics concerning the historical figures were also said to be \"over-the-top\" and colorful enough to the point of ridiculousness, though impressive. What gained \"Kessen\" the most praise was the game's sound department, many citing the orchestral score to be \"epic\" with one critic noting the \"English voices to be good and fitting\". Overall, it is seen as a game for history buffs of Japanese history with a good but flawed presentation.\n\nThe title won a special prize PlayStation Award in 2000. It was also nominated for the grand prize in the consumers' selection for graphics and scenarios.\n\n"}

The alliance, which initially comprised the three major northern states of Prussia, Hanover and Saxony, was set up officially to safeguard the constitutional integrity and territorial status quo of the Empire, but more immediately to oppose the long-cherished ambition of Joseph II to add Bavaria to the Habsburg domains. \n\nSoon after he became sole ruler of the Habsburg lands at the death of his mother Maria Theresa in 1780, Joseph II revived an old ambition and entered into negotiations with Elector Karl Theodor of the Palatinate and Bavaria with the aim of trading Bavaria for the Austrian Netherlands. Had the plan been brought to fruition, the Habsburgs would have augmented their core domains with a large contiguous German-speaking territory while at the same time getting rid of far-away provinces that has proven to be difficult and costly to defend whenever Austria had been at war with France. For Karl Theodor, his interest in the projected deal was mostly a matter of prestige as he envisioned himself as the ruler, possibly with the title of king, of a reconstructed Duchy of Burgundy composed of the Southern Netherlands plus his existing possessions in the Lower and Upper Rhine region, such as the Palatinate of the Rhine and the duchy of Berg-Jülich.\n\nThe rumored deal proved unpalatable both to the ambitious Frederick II, who saw himself as the foremost German monarch, and to the Electors of Hanover and Saxony who were disturbed by the far-reaching political and strategic implications of the projected territorial swap. Once they publicly declared their opposition though the creation of a \"Deutsche Fürstenbund\", the rulers of lesser Protestant states, including Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, Saxe-Gotha, Saxe-Weimar, Mecklenburg, Baden and Brandenburg-Ansbach, soon joined them. The Archbishop-Elector of Mainz, Archchancellor of the Empire, eventually gave his support, not least because it was known that Karl Theodor and Joseph II also mulled over the possible secularization of the Archbishopric of Salzburg, inconveniently wedged between Bavaria and Austria.\n\nJoseph II was taken aback by the suddenness and strength of the opposition to his plan and after some minor sabre-rattling suspended his project. Having attained its true objective, the \"Fürstenbund\" gradually disintegrated and disappeared altogether after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 and the death of Joseph II the year after.\n"}

Though usually referred to simply as \"Deception\", the game's official title is \"Tecmo's Deception\". \"Deception\" was released as Kokumeikan (刻命館) in Japan, and as Devil's Deception in Europe. The game is the first in the \"Deception\" series. It was a critical success, with reviewers particularly praising the originality of the game's concept.\n\n\"Deception\" is an action game with RPG elements, resembling the trap-em-up genre of games, such as \"Night Trap\" and \"Double Switch\". The primary object of the game is to dispatch intruders through the positioning and activation of traps.\n\nThe player takes on the role of an unjustly executed man, who pleads to the devil to spare his life at the moment of his demise. The devil (explicitly referred to as 'Satan' in the manual) grants his request, and gives him command over the 'Castle of the Damned'. Soon after taking control of the castle, many visitors soon find themselves drawn to the fortress: some for power, some for salvation, and some for something as simple as shelter.\n\nThe player has the option of either destroying intruders or letting them escape, with both choices carrying consequences: for example, the player may choose to either kill two parents, who are out to find a cure for their ailing daughter, or let them escape to inform others of the demonic presence invading the mansion. Additionally, killing intruders is sometimes the only way to proceed and gain more Magic Points (earned by taking the victims' souls) or gold (earned by killing the victims).\n\nGameplay is carried out by a three-dimensional representation of the character, and traps can then be activated and setup within varied rooms of the castle and then created before each respective level. The story will take various paths depending on the choices the player makes.\n\nTraps include the Spikes of Pain (three spikes stab an invader), the Square of Confinement (a cage falls from the ceiling, caging an invader), a pit trap, and a magic claw that picks up an invader. All traps can be upgraded to something more powerful than the last. For example, the trap called Stomp causes a giant foot to fall from the ceiling and can be upgraded to the much stronger Poison Toe, and then to Fire Foot, the strongest trap in the game.\n\nThe player can also make use of various items and use the cadavers of captured invaders to create monsters.\n\nThe game was met with a generally positive reception upon release. The four reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" focused on the game's originality, with Crispin Boyer referring to it as \"perhaps the most innovative console RPG ever released\". \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" later gave it their \"Best Original Concept\" award for 1996. In \"GamePro\", Art Angel scored it 5/5 for sound and 4.5/5 for graphics, control and fun factor. He praised the engaging story line, innovative gameplay, eerie and atmospheric sounds, and detailed graphics, concluding it to be an \"excellent addition to the RPG market. It has something most other RPGs seem to have lost: originality.\" A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" was critical of the fact that the player cannot attack victims directly, saying it made the gameplay \"oddly passive\", and also commented unfavorably on the slow pace and lack of multiple save slots. However, he praised the graphics and the originality of the concept, describing it as \"one of the strangest and subtly disturbing games we've ever played.\"\n"}

{"id": "2034084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2034084", "title": "State Bar of California", "text": "State Bar of California\n\nThe State Bar of California is California's official attorney licensing agency. It is responsible for managing the admission of lawyers to the practice of law, investigating complaints of professional misconduct, and prescribing appropriate discipline. It is directly responsible to the Supreme Court of California. All attorney admissions and disbarments are issued as recommendations of the State Bar, which are then routinely ratified by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe State Bar was legally established on July 29, 1927, when the State Bar Act went into effect. The State Bar of California is the largest in the United States, with over 270,000 living members as of November 2019, of whom over 190,000 are on active status. It is headquartered in San Francisco, with a branch office in Los Angeles.\nCalifornia is among the majority of American states that operate an integrated (mandatory) bar, in which the statewide bar association is integrated with the judiciary and active membership therein is required in order to practice law. Article 6, Section 9 of the California Constitution states:\n\nThe State Bar acts as the administrative arm of the California Supreme Court in matters involving the admission, regulation, and discipline of attorneys. Its structure, responsibilities and powers are elaborated in the State Bar Act, Sections 6000–6238 of the Business and Professions Code, as well as its own Rules of the State Bar of California and certain portions of the California Rules of Court. Generally, practicing law in the state of California without being a member of the State Bar is the crime of unauthorized practice of law. The only exceptions are for patent attorneys who restrict their practice to the prosecution of patent applications (i.e., the process of obtaining a patent before the United States Patent and Trademark Office); attorneys who practice areas of law exclusively regulated by the federal government (such as immigration) under a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 1963 that prohibited states from restricting the practice of exclusively federal areas of law; and attorneys from other states who have applied to the California courts for temporary admission \"pro hac vice\" to work on a single California case in collaboration with a member of the State Bar.\n\nThe State Bar's predecessor was a voluntary state bar association known as the California Bar Association. The leader of the effort to establish an integrated (official) bar was Judge Jeremiah F. Sullivan, who first proposed the concept at the CBA's Santa Barbara convention in September 1917, and provided the CBA with a copy of a Quebec statute as a model.\n\nIt took almost ten years to establish an integrated bar in California. Sullivan, who was also the President of the Bar Association of San Francisco, organized BASF committees to draft and propose appropriate legislation. Both BASF-drafted bills died in the California Legislature, in 1919 and 1921. In 1922, Sullivan finally persuaded the CBA to take action on his proposal; the CBA drafted a new bill, lobbied lawyers and legislators around the state for their support, and persuaded the Legislature to pass the bill in 1925. That bill died by Governor Friend Richardson's pocket veto.\n\nAfter two more years of lobbying, the CBA tried again. Governor C. C. Young signed the State Bar Act into law on March 16, 1927. On May 12, 1927, the Supreme Court of California appointed the State Bar Commission, which in turn established the State Bar of California as an operating entity with offices at 519 California Street in San Francisco on July 30, 1927. The State Bar immediately mailed out registration forms (demanding a $3 preorganization fee as authorized by the Act) to all California attorneys. Identification numbers were assigned to each attorney as they registered; notably, State Bar Number 1 went to Chief Justice William H. Waste.\n\nBy October 1, 1927, 7,872 lawyers had registered. These lawyers then voted by mail for the State Bar's first Board of Governors. On November 17, the State Bar held a preorganization dinner at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco, followed by the formal organization meeting the next day. By the time the dinner started, 9,602 lawyers had registered. The next morning, during the State Bar's organization meeting, the CBA yielded to its successor by winding up its affairs and ending its corporate existence.\n\nThe State Bar of California is one of a small number of State Bars where whose member fee structure must be ratified annually by both the legislature and the governor. Without such annual reauthorization, it can charge California lawyers only $77 per year.\n\nIn 1990, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in \"Keller v. State Bar of California\" that attorneys who are required to be members of a state bar association have a First Amendment right to refrain from subsidizing the organization's political or ideological activities as was the case with the California State Bar's activities.\n\nIn October 1997, Governor Pete Wilson vetoed the fee authorization bill for that year. He pointed out that California's bar had the highest annual fee in the country at $478. He also stated that the State Bar had become bloated and inefficient and criticized its Conference of Delegates for taking positions on divisive political issues like abortion. The State Bar's political and lobbying activities, combined with the compulsory nature of its dues, had already resulted in a U.S. Supreme Court case in which the State Bar was forced to allow attorneys to opt out of paying dues to support positions that they found abhorrent, \"Keller v. State Bar of California\", .\n\nAs a result, the State Bar was forced to lay off 500 of its 700 personnel on June 26, 1998. For six months, the State Bar's attorney disciplinary system was nonfunctional. On December 3, 1998, the Supreme Court of California unanimously held that it had the power to impose an emergency annual fee of $171.44 on all California lawyers to fund the attorney disciplinary system. See \"In re Attorney Disciplinary System\", 19 Cal. 4th 582 (1998). By then, the backlog of unprocessed complaints had soared to 6,000.\n\nOn September 7, 1999, Governor Gray Davis signed a bill that set the annual fee for the State Bar at $395, thus ending the funding crisis. Since then, the State Bar has undertaken several reforms to improve the efficiency of its operations. In 2002, the State Bar split off the Conference of Delegates into a separate volunteer organization, now known as the Conference of California Bar Associations.\n\nOn October 11, 2009, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed the fee authorization bill for 2010. In his veto message accompanying the return of the unsigned bill to the Legislature, he stated that just as in 1997, the State Bar had again become inefficient, scandal-ridden, and excessively politicized.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, the California State Auditor's Office found that the State Bar was inefficient and had failed to properly engage with stakeholders. The State Auditor's Office also determined that the State Bar's client security fund had overstated its, and that the State Bar created an unnecessary nonprofit organization, and then used State Bar funds to cover the nonprofit's financial losses. The State Bar also changed its financial reporting practices for its Client Security Fund, in a way that masked the claims that the State Bar expects the Client Security Fund to pay.\n\nAnother punitive lapse occurred in 2016, when the State Legislature allowed its session to end without enacting a bill authorizing the bar to collect lawyer fees in 2017.\n\nThe task of deciding whom to admit to the bar is performed by the Committee of Bar Examiners and the Office of Admissions under procedures set out in the State Bar Act.\n\nPrior to law schools in the U.S., the only way to become an attorney was to \"read\" for the law. Usually this was done by reading Blackstone's \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\" as a textbook, and by interning for a judge or a lawyer for a prescribed period. The Bar candidate would then be questioned by a panel of court justices and accepted or rejected as an officer of the court. If accepted, the candidate was sworn into the Bar.\n\nCalifornia requires two years of pre-legal education before beginning the study of law. Once the pre-legal education is met, California has different paths to become a licensed attorney:\n\nRegardless of the path one takes to becoming a licensed attorney, most bar applicants take a special preparation course for the bar exam immediately following their graduation from law school.\n\nThere is no citizenship requirement for admission to the California bar exam; a person can be a citizen of any country and be admitted to practice in California. No particular type of visa, including a green card, is required for admission to the bar. However, applicants must have a Social Security Number to apply. Applicants are able to petition for an exception to the latter rule.\n\nProspective applicants must also pass the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination and undergo a background check to determine if the applicant has the \"good moral character\" necessary to practice law in California. A prospective applicant must receive a \"positive determination\" as to the inquiry on their \"moral character\" in addition to satisfying all other educational requirements and exam passages to be granted a license to practice law in California.\n\nThe majority of prospective lawyers studying for the California Bar attend law schools accredited by the ABA or approved by the CBE. Once they receive their J.D. degree from these schools they are eligible to take the bar exam.\n\nStudents may choose to become a licensed attorney through law schools that are not accredited by the ABA or approved by the State Bar of California Committee of Bar Examiners. Students attending these schools must also complete the First-Year Law Students' Examination (FYLSE, popularly known as the \"Baby Bar Examination\") before receiving credit for their law study.\n\nStudents should pass the FYLSE within three administrations after first becoming eligible to take the examination (which usually occurs upon completion of the first year of law study) in order to receive credit for law study undertaken up to the point of passage. It is possible for a student to pass the test after the first three administrations, but such a student will receive credit only for their first year of law study; no courses beyond the first year will be credited if a student takes more law school classes and passes the Baby Bar thereafter.\n\nThe California State Bar Law Office Study Program allows California residents to become California attorneys without graduating from college or law school, assuming they meet basic pre-legal educational requirements. (If the candidate has no college degree, he or she may take and pass the College Level Examination Program (CLEP).) The Bar candidate must study under a judge or lawyer for four years and must also pass the Baby Bar within three administrations after first becoming eligible to take the examination. They are then eligible to take the California Bar Examination.\n\nPersons already licensed as attorneys in other states may take the California Bar. Provided they have already taken the Multistate Bar Examination (MBE), they may omit that portion of the California Bar Examination. The attorneys opting to omit the MBE must have four years of being in good standing in their local jurisdictions. Attorneys without the required years of being in good standing take the General Examination, like most other applicants.\n\nCalifornia administers what is widely considered the nation's most difficult bar examination twice each year, in February and July. Several prominent attorneys and politicians have either never passed, or had difficulty passing, the California Bar Exam. Significant among these are former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa (a graduate of Peoples College of Law who never passed the bar exam after failing four times), Stanford law professor Kathleen Sullivan (Harvard Law School) (who failed the bar in July 2005 but passed on her second attempt in February 2006), California Governor and former Attorney General Jerry Brown (Yale Law School, '64) (who took it twice before passing) and former California Governor Pete Wilson (UC Berkeley School of Law) (who passed on his fourth attempt). Unsuccessful applicants have even sued the State Bar—unsuccessfully—on the grounds that the exam is unnecessarily difficult.\n\nBefore July 2017, the California Bar Examination consisted of 18 hours of examination time spread out over three days; the only U.S. state with a longer bar exam was Louisiana, at 21.5 hours of testing. (Louisiana law, in contrast to the common law system of the other 49 states, is based partially on civil law and is one of the few exams without a multiple choice component.) Beginning in July 2017, the California Bar Exam adopted a 2-day format.\n\nThe exam currently tests 13 different subject areas:\n\nThe written section of the exam accounts for 50% of the total score, which includes 5 essays and 1 90 minute performance test. Applicants sitting for the California Bar Examination do not know which of the 13 subjects listed above will in fact be tested on the essay portion of the examination. In recent years, it has been increasingly common for the exam to feature one or more \"crossover\" questions, which tests applicants in multiple subjects. Examples of past tested essays with sample answers are available on the California State Bar website.\n\nCalifornia-specific legal knowledge is required only for Evidence, Civil Procedure, Wills, Community Property, and Professional Responsibility; for the other topics, either general common law (\"bar exam law\") or the federal laws apply. Beginning in July 2007, applicants may be tested on the California Evidence Code and the California Code of Civil Procedure in the essay portion of the exam in addition to the Federal Rules of Evidence and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nThe Multistate Bar Examination (MBE) portion of the exam accounts for 50% of the total score and is a nationally administered, 200-question multiple choice exam. As of February 2007, only 190 questions are scored, and the other 10 are unscored experimental questions used to gauge their appropriateness for future exams. The MBE covers only the topics of contracts (including sales of goods under Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code), real property, torts, constitutional law, criminal law and procedure, the Federal Rules of Evidence, and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. While the essay section of the exam may test one or more of these areas as well, the MBE section is dedicated to these subjects.\n\nThe exam sites are usually large convention centers in Northern and Southern California. Exam security is tight. For example, proctors are assigned to stand in restrooms for the duration of the entire exam to prevent applicants from asking each other for assistance. Additionally, applicants are required to provide fingerprints, photo identification, and a handwriting sample at the testing site.\n\nOverall bar exam pass rates tend to hover between 35% and 55%, and are always the lowest in the United States. In October 2017, the California Supreme Court reviewed the passing score of the California Bar Exam, after being urged by various law schools to lower the passing score. After review, the California Supreme Court declined to lower the passing score, leaving it intact.\n\nThe lowest pass rate occurred in February 2020 when 26.8% of takers passed. First-time California Bar Exam takers have a pass rate around 60%. When considering only graduates of ABA-approved schools, the average pass rate for the years 2003–2006 was 54.5%, which was 8.9% lower than the pass rate for Florida, the next lowest \"large population\" jurisdiction. The overall pass rate for the July 2018 California Bar Examination was 40.7%.\n\nOn February 1, 2014, Sergio C. Garcia, an undocumented immigrant, was sworn in as a member of the State Bar of California, making him the nation's first undocumented immigrant to become an attorney. The bar admission came almost one month after the state supreme court held that undocumented immigrants were not automatically disqualified from being licensed as attorneys in the state. Under that ruling, as well as a statute that Governor Brown signed into law taking effect on January 1, 2014 (in order to take advantage of a specific provision of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act discussed at oral argument before the state supreme court), Garcia was admitted to the state bar. Garcia was brought to the United States as a child and remained, according to court findings, undocumented through no fault of his own. He grew up in Northern California, graduated from college and law school. He passed the California Bar Exam on the first try, and satisfied the Committee of Bar Examiners of his good moral character.\n\nCalifornia is currently the only state that does not use either set of professional responsibility rules developed by the American Bar Association. California professional responsibility law is divided among California Business & Professions Code Section 6068 (the statutory duties of an attorney), the California Rules of Professional Conduct (CRPC), and a number of uncodified cases. A few of the CRPC rules have clearly been inspired by ABA rules, though. A number of innovations in professional responsibility law have first arisen in California, such as Cumis counsel.\n\nOf all American states, California imposes the strongest duty of confidentiality upon its attorneys. There were no exceptions to the duty until 2004, when Business & Professions Code Section 6068 was amended to add a single discretionary exception to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm. The amendment was borrowed from the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2014, the Commission for the Revision of the Rules of Professional Conduct of the State Bar of California worked on a comprehensive revision of the California rules that was intended to, among other things, convert them into a heavily modified, localized version of the Model Rules. That is, the result would look like the Model Rules, but with appropriate modifications to preserve the substance of existing California rules that better reflect local laws and customs.\n\nHowever, the Commission's progress was very slow, simply because there are so many substantive and structural differences between the California rules and the Model Rules. The Commission finally finished nearly all the revisions in 2010 and the State Bar Board of Governors (later renamed the Board of Trustees) ratified them in July and September of that year. However, the proposed revisions could not go into effect unless and until they were also approved by the Supreme Court of California. As of 2014, 11 of 67 proposed rules had been finalized and submitted to the Court for its approval.\n\nOn September 19, 2014, for reasons that were not fully explained, the Supreme Court of California suddenly returned to the State Bar all proposed revised rules that had been submitted for its consideration. The Court's letter directed the State Bar to start the process all over again with a new Commission, and to submit a new set of revised rules by March 31, 2017.\n\nCalifornia operates its own State Bar Court, staffed by judges who specialize in handling only professional responsibility cases on a full-time basis (i.e., it is their primary job function). Most other jurisdictions either appoint special masters on an \"ad hoc\" basis to adjudicate such cases, or have disciplinary commissions or boards that function on a part-time basis and hold relatively informal hearings.\n\nComplaints against attorneys are investigated and prosecuted by the State Bar's Office of the Chief Trial Counsel. Under the State Bar Act, upon receiving a complaint, the Bar may choose whether to open an investigation. If the Bar does find sufficient evidence of misconduct, decides that it has standing, and decides to take action to impose discipline, it has the power to proceed against accused attorneys either in the Supreme Court of California or in the State Bar Court. The State Bar holds that it may decline to review complaints that are not made by a judge who heard a matter related to the complaint.\n\nComplaints of professional misconduct are usually first prosecuted in the Hearing Department of the State Bar Court. If the lawyer disagrees with an adverse decision, he or she may appeal to the Review Department of the State Bar Court, and from there to the state supreme court. Although the State Bar Court's decisions are technically only recommendations, the distinction is largely academic. Failure to comply with conditions imposed as part of any form of lesser discipline short of disbarment can itself result in a recommendation of disbarment, which is virtually always ratified because the attorney's noncompliance with the State Bar Act will have been clearly established by that point.\n\nIn February 2012, Jon B. Streeter, President of the State Bar, said:\n\nThe State Bar's primary interface with its attorney members is the Member Services Center, which keeps member personal information up-to-date, sends out annual fee statements, collects fees, and sends out annual membership cards. The State Bar also offers CalBar Connect, a Web site which lists third-party vendors who currently offer discounts to State Bar members (as well as any relevant discount codes).\n\nThe Department of Legal Specialization, under the supervision of the Board of Legal Specialization, officially certifies legal specialists in 11 different practice areas. It was first announced in February 1971 as the first such program anywhere in the United States. It began actual operations in 1973 with three practice areas initially available: workers' compensation, criminal law, and tax law.\n\nThe Minimum Continuing Legal Education Program, launched in 1990, certifies continuing legal education providers and enforces the MCLE requirement (currently 25 hours every three years) through random audits.\n\nThe Lawyer Assistance Program, created in 2002, assists lawyers with mental health and substance abuse problems.\n\nThe Mandatory Fee Arbitration Program, created in 1978, resolves attorney-client disputes over attorney fees. It is voluntary for clients but mandatory for attorneys if the client demands it.\n\nThe State Bar operates the Committee on Judicial Nominees Evaluation, which conducts confidential evaluations of persons identified by the Governor as candidates for judicial office and produces a rating of \"exceptionally well qualified,\" \"well qualified,\" \"qualified,\" or \"not qualified.\"\n\nThe Office of Access and Inclusion certifies lawyer referral services, carries out strategic objectives around diversifying the profession, supports the Legal Services Trust Fund Commission, which distributes grants to nonprofit organizations that provide legal services to low-income Californians, funded by the state Interest on Lawyer Trust Accounts program, the Equal Access Fund, and the Justice Gap Fund, and supports efforts to encourage and coordinate pro bono representation. \n\nThe Client Security Fund Commission operates the Client Security Fund, which provides compensation for clients whose attorneys committed certain types of crimes against them like theft or embezzlement.\n\nOn November 13, 2014, the State Bar issued a statement saying that former State Senator Joseph Dunn's employment as Executive Director had been terminated by the Board of Trustees. The same day, Dunn filed a whistle-blower lawsuit against the State Bar challenging the termination because he had exposed malfeasance and \"egregious improprieties.\" The State Bar denied Dunn's allegations, saying the \"Board received a complaint from a high-level employee raising serious, wide-ranging allegations about ... Dunn and certain State Bar employees.\" The lawsuit was eventually diverted into arbitration, and in March 2017, the arbitrator rejected Dunn's claims and exonerated the State Bar for his firing.\n\nOn October 2, 2017, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law Senate Bill 36. SB 36, sponsored by Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) which mandated the separation of the sections of the State Bar into a new 501(c)(6) entity. This Association was designed to house the 16 sections of the State Bar of California, as well as the California Young Lawyers Association. The sections provide low-cost continuing education for attorneys, which the State Bar of California requires. The sections also work with legislators to interpret, amend, and propose legislation. While lawyers are required to pay dues to the State Bar of California to practice law in the state, membership within the sections is voluntary. SB 36 helped formalize the separation, reauthorized mandatory dues for two years, and reduced the number of lawyers on its State Bar of California's Board of Trustees. The separation became official on January 1, 2018 with the launch of the California Lawyers Association.\n\n"}

She combines traditional Irish, Celtic and folk ballads with Cajun, world-beat, and progressive rock influences and her own creative songwriting.\nA native of Lafayette, Louisiana, Patterson began her professional career in her teens as a classical oboist and a Cajun bass player. She spent a year studying traditional Irish music and ethnomusicology at University College Cork in Ireland, where she began to experiment with musical fusion. She later finished her bachelor's degree in Music Therapy from Loyola University New Orleans. Patterson cites the \"progressive rock\" band Rush as a major musical influence.\n\nPatterson was a founding member of the ensemble the Poor Clares, who debuted in 2003 at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival to rave reviews. The Poor Clares' albums include \"Change of Habit\" and \"Songs for Midwinter\", distributed nationally by Centaur Records. Patterson released her first four solo albums on the Little Blue Men Records label, including two studio productions, the somewhat more traditionally-oriented but still musically eclectic \"Hybrid Vigor\", the world-beat and progressive-rock-influenced \"Take Some Fire\", and the 2005 live album, \"Caught in the Act\". Her 2009 release, \"On Better Paths,\" is the most daring, crossing boundaries of form and genre even further. The recording received a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Folk Album. After leaving Little Blue Men Records, Patterson continued to record solo albums. She has also played on and produced other albums, including \"Orin\" (2005) by the French Breton progressive-folk group TornaoD. She has appeared on over one hundred and seventy recordings.\n\nPatterson was a regular performer at O'Flaherty's Irish Pub in New Orleans's famed French Quarter, until the Pub closed when Hurricane Katrina hit at the end of August 2005. Patterson has since been playing regularly at other New Orleans venues, particularly the Kerry Irish Pub. She has also toured in Australia & New Zealand, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, and Ireland, as well as much of the United States. She is especially a favorite of Celtic music fans in the Washington, D.C. area.\n\nStarting in 2013 into 2018, \"Bad Beth & Beyond\", Beth Patterson's bawdy and profane alter ego, performed in the French Quarter. \"Bad Beth\" used the Irish bouzouki, just as Patterson does, while singing risque originals and covers. \"Bad Beth & Beyond\" released the album \"2 Deep\" in 2013 and the single \"My Therapist Thinks You're an Asshole\" in 2018. (See also Bed Bath and Beyond.)\n\nPatterson, singing and bouzouki, and her husband Josh Paxton, on piano, perform as the duo ZoüKeys, as of 2017-2019. Also as of 2019, Patterson performs solo, and with the Round Pegs Duo, the Round Pegs 3 Piece Duo, a duo with Patrick O'Flaherty (also of the Poor Clares), New Orleans Steamcog Orchestra (as \"B.P. Hatbox\"), as a bouzouki or English horn player, etc.\n\nPatterson's preferred instrument is the Irish bouzouki, a teardrop-shaped eight-string instrument of Greek origin that became popular in Irish music in the 1960s. She plays a 10-string bouzouki as well. Patterson uses Infiniti oboe reeds, D'Addario strings, and an Ebow string driver.\n\nPatterson's film soundtrack credits include the motion pictures \"Lucinda's Spell\", \"One Eyed King\" (starring William Baldwin and Armand Assante), and most recently Mike Judge's \"Extract\" (on Miramax), starring Jason Bateman, Mila Kunis, and Ben Affleck.\n\nPatterson was mentioned in three of the Griffen McCandles (Dragons) series of novels written by science fiction/fantasy authors Robert Asprin and Jody Lynn Nye: \"Dragons Wild\", \"Dragons Deal\", and \"Dragons Run\". An entire chapter of \"Dragons Run\" takes place at a fictional Patterson concert.\n\nPatterson began writing fiction in 2012.

It was settled by treaty in 1648, when the county was given jointly to Princesses Ernestine and Johanette, two sisters who were granddaughters of Count William, and their mother Dowager Countess Louise Juliane made regent. But shortly after the treaty, the county was split between the two. Ernestine's portion was called \"Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hachenburg\". Johanette's was \"Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn-Altenkirchen\" (or Sayn-Altenkirchen for short).

As a single skater, he was the 1953 World bronze medalist, a two-time European champion (1953, 1954), and a ten-time Italian national champion (1945–54).\n\nFassi was born in Milan, the son of a builder. He spoke five languages. He married Christa Fassi (von Kuczkowski) in 1960. They had three children: Ricardo, Monika, and Lorenzo.\n\nFassi competed in two disciplines at the 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, Switzerland, placing 15th in men's singles and 13th in pair skating with partner Grazia Barcellona. Appearing only in men's singles, he finished sixth at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, Norway.\nFassi won gold at the European Championships in 1953 and 1954, and the bronze medal at the World Championships in 1953. He was the Italian national men's champion for ten years.\n\nDeclining to join the Ice Capades, Fassi took up coaching after the end of his competitive career. From 1956 to 1961, he coached at the Olympic Stadium in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, and for four years served as the trainer for the Italian World team. One of his first students was German skater Christa von Kuczkowski.\n\nFollowing the 1961 plane crash that killed the entire U.S. figure skating team and many of the top American coaches, Fassi moved with his family to the United States, where he soon became established as a top international coach. He was based first at the famous Broadmoor Arena in Colorado Springs, Colorado, then for a time in Denver, Colorado before returning to the Broadmoor in the early 1980s. He spent three years in Italy in the early 1990s and then returned to the U.S. to coach at the Ice Castle rink in Lake Arrowhead, California.\n\nHis students included World and Olympic champions Peggy Fleming, Dorothy Hamill, John Curry, Robin Cousins, and Jill Trenary. He also coached Scott Hamilton and Paul Wylie in the early stages of their careers. Skaters from all over the world came to train with Fassi, giving his training camp a strongly cosmopolitan and international atmosphere.\n\nIn addition to being an excellent technical coach, Fassi had the reputation of being a master of political dealings in the figure skating world, with the ability to bring his students to the attention of the judges. He was such an icon in the sport that when the comic character Snoopy adopted an alter ego as a figure skating coach (appearing, for example, in the 1980 TV special \"She's a Good Skate, Charlie Brown\"), it was clearly modelled upon Fassi.\n\nFassi died of a heart attack at the 1997 World Championships in Lausanne, which he was attending as the coach of Nicole Bobek and Cornel Gheorghe. He was inducted into the Coaches Hall of Fame by the Professional Skaters Association in 2002.\n\nAfter Fassi's death, U.S. skater Linda Fratianne and her coach Frank Carroll alleged that Fassi had conspired to \"rob\" Fratianne of the gold medal at the 1980 Winter Olympics by masterminding a deal with Eastern-bloc judges to swap votes for his own pupil Robin Cousins in the men's event with those for the East German champion Anett Pötzsch in the ladies' event. The allegations became so well known that the story has subsequently been repeated as if it were fact.\n\nSonia Bianchetti, referee of the men's competition at those Olympics, has denied that the judging of either event was incorrect, and noted that only two of the nine judges on the ladies' panel were from Eastern-bloc countries—while five other judges also gave their first-place votes to Pötzsch. Benjamin Wright, the American referee of the ladies' event, instead blamed the method of tabulating scores that was in effect at that time for Fratianne's defeat.\n\nFassi had five students of his own competing in the ladies' event in Lake Placid: Emi Watanabe of Japan, Susanna Driano of Italy, Claudia Kristofics-Binder of Austria, Kristiina Wegelius of Finland, and Karena Richardson of Great Britain.\n"}

A sequel, \"Still Life 2\", was released in 2009. The game has since sold 240,000 copies worldwide.\n\nA major theme throughout the game is art, especially the technique of still life that the game is named after. The game also uses a storytelling device of switching back and forth between two player characters.\n\nFBI Special Agent Victoria McPherson is investigating a series of brutal murders in 2004 Chicago. While visiting her father for Christmas she discovers an old notebook that belonged to her grandfather, private investigator Gustav McPherson. Victoria is surprised to learn that Gus had been involved with investigating a very similar series of murders in 1920s Prague. The player alternates between these two characters as they work to hunt down what seems to be the same serial killer more than 70 years apart.\n\nIn both cases the murderer targets sex trade workers: street prostitutes in Prague, and employees of an exclusive Chicago massage parlor and S&M club called the Red Lantern. The killer or killers are disguised in a dark cloak, top hat, and silver mask.\n\nGus eventually identifies the man responsible for the Prague murders, but the killer escapes justice and relocates to America. Near the end of the game Victoria discovers that similar murders occurred in 1931 Chicago and later in 1956 Los Angeles.\n\nThe identity of the 2004 Chicago killer is never revealed. Victoria encounters him several times, but never sees behind his mask. She does not believe he is the same person as the Prague killer, but rather a younger person who has been influenced by the Prague killer in some way. At the climax of the game, Victoria manages to shoot the Chicago killer, but he plunges into the Chicago river and does not surface. As the game ends, the Chicago police are still searching the river for the killer's body. Victoria plans to travel to Los Angeles to learn more about the 1956 killings.\n\nA controversy surrounding the game is its lack of an ending. Originally planned as the second of a trilogy, with \"Post Mortem\" as the first, \"Still Life\" ends without revealing the villain. The story was meant to continue in a third game, but it seemed unlikely that the finalé would ever be made, as part of the development arm of Microïds in Canada was bought out by Ubisoft. However, on December 6, 2007, Microïds announced the development of a sequel, \"Still Life 2\", which was released in 2009. On September 19, 2008 a new \"Still Life\" series website was opened, covering the three games.\n\n\"Still Life\" was made with Virtools applications; the same software as \"Post Mortem\" and some other Microïds games. The point and click gameplay is also based on the first two games in the \"Syberia\" franchise.\n\nAccording to Microïds, \"Still Life\" and its predecessor, \"Post Mortem\", were commercial successes. The publisher reported combined global sales for the series above 500,000 units by September 2008. The worldwide sell-through of \"Still Life\" alone surpassed 240,000 units by May 2009.\n\n\"Still Life\" received fairly favorable reviews from critics. Its Metacritic scores are 75/100 for PC and 70/100 for Xbox, based on reviews by respectively 27 and 29 critics. Its GameRankings scores are 75.77% for PC and 68.68% for Xbox, based on reviews by respectively 35 and 31 critics. David Clayman of IGN commented: \"\"Still Life\" is an enjoyable albeit short diversion for fans of classic adventure games. As usual, this type of game controls better on a PC and character movement feels slow and clunky with the Xbox controller.\" Eurogamer's John Walker: \"There's a lot that \"Still Life\" does well, but in the same way adventure games were doing things well ten years ago. There is therefore no excuse for it to not manage other basic, fundamental elements when rehashing these decade-old ideas.\" Shannon Hall of Just Adventure: \"Anyone who loves a mystery and has an investigative mind will get many hours of pleasure from \"Still Life\".\" Ryan Davis, writing for GameSpot: \"Its slavish dedication to convention will scratch the methodical, cerebral itch all diehard adventure game fans have. As a genre exercise, though, it exerts little energy to draw in new players.\"\n\n\"Still Life\" was a finalist for \"PC Gamer US\"s \"Best Adventure Game 2005\" award, which ultimately went to \"Indigo Prophecy\".\n\nIn 2011, Adventure Gamers named \"Still Life\" the 20th-best adventure game ever released.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2034160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2034160", "title": "Jōsei Toda", "text": "Jōsei Toda\n\nToda was the disciple of Tsunesaburō Makiguchi and mentor of Daisaku Ikeda, respectively the first and third presidents of the Soka Gakkai. He used the term \"human revolution\" to embrace Makiguchi's thoughts on the pursuits of education and happiness in life as \"inextricably connected in a lifelong journey toward continual self-development.\" Toda's leadership in building the Soka Gakkai is the theme of Ikeda's 12-volume roman à clef, \"The Human Revolution\" (\"Ningen kakumei\") \n\nToda was born in 1900, the eleventh son of a fisherman's family in the coastal village of Shioya, in modern-day Kaga, Ishikawa, off the Sea of Japan. In 1904 his family moved to Hokkaido, settling in the fishing village of Atsuta. From the age of 15 he worked his way through school, earning certification first as a substitute primary school teacher at age 17 then, three years later, as a full-time primary school teacher. In 1920 he moved to Tokyo where he met Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, an elementary school principal, who was to become his mentor. He taught for Makiguchi until 1922, after which he opened a private school and tutored students preparing for their middle-school entrance exams.\n\nToda and his wife suffered the loss of a 6-month old daughter in 1923 and his wife died two years later from tuberculosis. Toda contracted the same illness as well and was often ill.\n\nHis financial fortunes changed with the successful publication and reception of his arithmetic tutorial book.\n\nAfter he began teaching in Yubari, young coalminers in the area would come to his home after work to discuss issues such as politics and history. It is documented that he also submitted an education reform proposal to the Ministry of Education containing ideas to improve the conditions of teachers as well as developing more capable school leaders. According to a diary entry in 1920, part of his reason for moving from Hokkaido to Tokyo was an ambition to become \"a world citizen.\"\n\nToda's vivid personality stood in stark contrast to that of his mentor, Tsunesaburo Makiguchi who was a scholar and pedagogue. Toda has been described as \"a hard-sell pitchman for his faith--frank, vigorous, often rude, talkative. He had the ability to vividly and strongly articulate the ideas of Nichiren and Makiguchi. His authenticity and enthusiasm had a marked effect on the people he met.\n\nToda also evidenced strength in organizational innovation, in establishing a grid of vertical and horizontal communication lines that lent cohesiveness to the Soka Gakkai's organizational structure.\n\nAlthough Toda's work in education is best known through his editing and financing Makiguchi's \"System of Value-Creating Pedagogy,\" he was also active as a teacher and author.\n\nToda's first teaching assignment was at Mayachi Primary School, located in a remote section of Ubari, Hokkaido, a coal-mining town. He started working there in 1918 as a substitute teacher and a year later was appointed as a 6th grade teacher upon passing a certification exam. He quit suddenly in 1920 but remained in correspondence with his students for 15 years.\n\nThe most exhaustive treatment of Toda's educational ideas is by Shiohara. According to Shiohara, Toda derived a teaching method from his own research specifically geared to meet the needs of his Miyachi elementary school students, who came from disadvantaged backgrounds and suffered low grades.\n\nMakiguchi hired Toda as a substitute teacher at Nishimachi Elementary School. Toda changed positions in order to keep working with Makiguchi when the latter was forcefully transferred to Mikasa Elementary School, a school for poorer students in Tokyo.\n\nRather than traveling with Makiguchi to Shirokane Elementary School when Makiguchi was forcefully transferred again, Toda opened an tutorial school called \"Jishu Gakkan\" where he applied value-creating pedagogy in an independent setting. Toda rented a vacant lot near Meguro Station and built a two-story facility which formally opened in 1924. Jisho Gakkan operated for two decades, earning a prominent reputation for its success rate in preparing pupils for secondary-level entrance examinations.\n\nToda used a liberal and creative approach to study developed in consultation with Makiguchi. Ikeda described Jisho Gakkan in the opening chapter of his semi-fictionalized biography of Toda.\n\nMakiguchi's major work, \"The System of Value-Creating Pedagogy,\" was published on November 18, 1930. This event marks the day the Soka Gakkai considers as its founding. Makiguchi parallels Toda's role in publishing this book to that of Christen Mikkelsen Kold who popularized the educational ideas of N. F. S. Grundtvig in Denmark. Toda organized Makiguchi's enormous volume of scribbled notes into a manuscript which then Makiguchi thoroughly reviewed. \"The System of Value-Creating Pedagogy\" was ultimately published by Fuzanbo, of which Taizo Oinuma, the publisher of Makiguchi's \"Geography of Human Life,\" was a manager. Four volumes were published between 1930 and 1932. During the difficult years of publishing, Toda also organized the parents of many of his Jishu Gakkan students who were also students at Shirokane Elementary School to protest and ultimately delay Makiguchi's forced retirement from Shirokane. As a result, Makiguchi was able to publish the first two volumes as an incumbent school principal, just as he wished.\n\nToda was active in creating a prominent group of 28 supporters who endorsed \"The System of Value-Creating Pedagogy\" including Tsuyoshi Inukai, who was to rise to become prime minister of Japan in 1931. The first volume of the \"System of Value-Creating Pedagogy\" included a calligraphy by Inukai as well as forewords by Inazo Nitobe, who at that time was one of the Under-Secretaries General of the League of Nations, sociologist Suketoshi Tanabe, and the folklorist Kunio Yanagita.\n\nToda's first published work, \"Katei Kyoikugaku Soron\" (An Anatomy of Home Education: Talking about entrance exams for middle level school, and turning our precious children into straight-A students), published in December 1929, was based on Makiguchi's work before the publishing of \"The System of Value-Creating Pedagogy.\" He forcefully denounced \"entrance examination hell\" and the predicament of students who are devalued because of their poor grades.\" He blames teachers who try to educate children uniformly, ignoring their unique interests and perspectives. In 1930 he published the \"Suirisiki Sido Sanjutsu\" (Guidebook to Mathematics Through Reasoning based on the principles of Value-Creating Pedagogy). This became a best seller selling over one million copies. Makiguchi credited this book as being an excellent example of his theories, resulting in \"an economy to learning,\" helping students achieve remarkable progress in the development of mathematical understanding as they develop their own powers of reasoning, and fostering their abilities to reason their way to \"the life of value.\"\n\nToda also founded and edited an educational magazine dedicated to spreading and promoting Value-Creating Pedagogy entitled \"Shinshin Kyozai Kankyo\" (\"New Teaching Material: The Environment\"). The educational magazine continued as a series for more than six years, changing its title to \"New Collection of Teaching Materials,\" to \"New Teaching Materials,\" and, finally, to \"Educational Remodeling.\" In these research magazines he helped elementary school teachers to put Makiguchi's pedagogy into practice.\n\nIn addition to these editing and publishing assignments, Toda wrote two works, \"Guidelines for teaching mathematics\" and \"The establishment of the System of Value-Creating Pedagogy,\" both based on the principles of value-creating education. He expanded his methodologies to other fields. He published four books for fifth and sixth graders entitled \"Guidance on Reading Through Reasoning.\" Although never published he edited the book \"Guidance on the three subjects of science, geography and history,\" which applied the System of Value-Creating Pedagogy to these fields. His final pre-war contribution to education came in the January of 1940; Toda launched a magazine for learning, entitled \"Shogakusei Nihon (Elementary School Children Japan)\" which included correspondence materials. In each issue, according to Shiohara, he contributed a foreword and poured his passion into editing duties. He managed this despite strict restrictions imposed in the nation's system of militarism support.\n\nFollowing Makiguchi, Toda began practicing Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism some time between 1928 and 1930, which brought a \"spiritual dimension\" to their work on Makiguchi's educational theories and underlying premise that each individual has potential. Apparently Toda was initially not as eager as Makiguchi in his new faith but, out of respect and gratitude, followed his mentor's direction and attributed his personal successes to Makiguchi's teachings of modern philosophy combined with lay Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nToda supported the editing and publication of Makiguchi's \"Sōka kyōikugaku taikei\" (\"The System of Value-Creating Pedagogy\") which was published in 1930 and marked the founding of the Sōka Kyōiku Gakkai (\"Value Creation Education Society\"), the organization that preceded the Soka Gakkai.\n\nIt appears that Toda financed much of the operations of the Soka Kyoiku Gakkai singlehandedly. His pre-war net worth was more than ¥6,000,000, approximately 9,500,000USD in today's currency. Toda served as chairperson of the board of directors. His tutoring school had signage above the door bearing the name of the Soka Kyoiku Gakkai, perhaps indicating that it was used as the organization's convening place. He did cite his faith as the reason for his business success.\n\nAlthough he provided financial support to the Soka Kyoiku Gakkai, Toda appeared to be more interested in his business activities. He expanded his holdings to control 17 companies. He enjoyed drinking parties with his employees and Soka Kyoiku Gakkai members.\n\nWith the onset of World War II, Makiguchi and Toda met with harassment and persecution. Both were arrested and jailed by the government in 1943 on charges of blasphemy against the deified emperor (lèse-majesté) and violating the 1925 Peace Preservation Law. At first intended to suppress \"thought crimes\" of left-leaning groups, the law was amended in 1941 to include religious organizations. Toda and Makiguchi were among the approximate 80,000 people arrested for violating this law between 1925 and 1945. A total of 21 Soka Kyoiku Gakkai leaders were arrested and this effectively shuttered the Soka Kyoiku Gakkai organization. Makiguchi died in prison in 1944, and Toda was released just weeks before Japan's surrender in 1945.\n\nDuring his incarceration Toda endured malnutrition, interrogation and physical abuse without succumbing to his interrogators' demand that he recant his faith. At the start of 1944 Toda began meditating, studying, and chanting fiercely to understand the Lotus Sutra. He experienced two awakenings that had an enduring effect on the rest of his life. The first was a realization in March that the Buddha can be conceived of as \"the essence of cosmic life itself\" and therefore an inherent dignity shared by all human beings, which resulted in the quality of fearlessness in Toda's life. A second awakening took place in November 1944 when he became convinced that he was, in fact, one of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth, the mythic figures who appear in the Lotus Sutra and symbolize the inherent compassionate qualities within all people. From this realization Toda envisioned modern prospects of a movement whereby people awaken to life's inherent dignity and teach others to do the same.\n\nHe was released from prison on July 3, 1945 in failing health, severely impacted by malnutrition and harsh living conditions. Yet his prison experiences enabled him to undergo an inner transformation that brought to light his qualities of courage, wisdom, compassion, as well as an enhanced capacity for dialogue.\n\nReleased from prison on July 3, 1945, six weeks before the surrender of Japan on August 15, and physically weakened by his two years of imprisonment, Toda began reconstructing the Soka Kyoiku Gakkai. \n\nHis first task was to rebuild his businesses which he saw as the financial underpinning of the new organization. During the war he had accumulated more than ¥2,000,000 of debt. He attempted businesses starting with correspondence courses. The post-war business climate was tumultuous and racked by inflation and scarcity of materials. Many of his ventures met with failure.\n\nNews of his release began to spread and many prewar members came to consult with him to rebuild their personal faith. Toda began to sponsor study lectures on the Lotus Sutra and Nichren's writings and he presided over small group discussion meetings. On May 1 Toda was appointed chair of the board of directors. The organization name was changed from Soka Kyoiku Gakkai to Soka Gakkai, publications resumed, a youth division was organized, and membership grew by about 200 members in 1946. On August 14, 1947 Daisaku Ikeda attended a discussion meeting and met Toda; he joined the Soka Gakkai ten days later.\n\nUltimately Toda had to resign his position on November 12, 1950 due to his business failures. He regarded these business failures as \"divine retribution for failure to devote himself to leading Soka Gakkai.\" After deep reflection he assented to the role of second president on May 3, 1951. At that time the membership consisted of approximately 3,000 families. At his inauguration he announced to the 1500 assembled members his determination to reach a membership of 750,000 families before his death, a target that was met with disbelief from most of the attendees.\n\nToda made several important and lasting contributions to the Soka Gakkai.\n\nToda's accomplishments as the second president of the Soka Gakkai are a crucial link in the Soka Gakkai lineage referred to as \"the oneness of mentor and disciple.\" Toda was the only one of Makiguchi's disciples who did not disavow his faith and so remained in prison. He inherited the legacy of Makiguchi and transformed the group, which had collapsed during the war, into a mass movement dedicated to personal and societal transformation. In so doing he reshaped Makiguchi's philosophy of value creation to the pressing needs of people in postwar Japan. He formed a \"living bond between Makiguchi and Ikeda.\" Over the course of eleven years of training, he raised Daisaku Ikeda who then led the Soka Gakkai for over 50 years.\n\nStrand notes that most religious movements have a trio of founders, corresponding to the three phases of “creation, development, and stabilization.” In the case of the Soka Gakkai Makiguchi’s was the risky act of creation. Toda took on the difficult work of formation. He provided the crucial link between the initiator, Makiguchi, and Ikeda who led the third task of international evangelism.\n\nEarly traces of Toda's \"life philosophy\" can be found in his first published textbook, An Anatomy of Home Education, as well as his most successful textbook, A Deductive Guide to Arithmetic.\n\nToda's epiphanous realizations in 1943 and 1944, while confined to a cell in Sugamo prison, conceptually linked the vitalistic, inexhaustible \"life force\" of the Buddha and his sense of mission as among the Bodhisattvas of the Earth with Makiguchi's philosophy. Toda equated this with \"the true meaning of life.\"\n\nLater Toda captured these realizations in the term \"human revolution\" which entailed transforming one's karma through Buddhist practice. This term was borrowed from a phrased used by Shigeru Nambara, president of Tokyo University, in 1947. The latter called for an inner transformation in the Japanese people to enable the success of occupation policies geared for social and political revolution. Toda used this term as the title of his autobiography published in 1957.\n\nAfter his release, Toda lectured and wrote extensively about his realizations, now calling them a “life force philosophy” (also translated as \"philosophy of life\") (\"seimeiron\"). As McLaughlin concludes: \"When Toda emerged from prison half a year later, he was driven not only by obligation to the memory of his master Makiguchi but by a sense of mission confirmed during his mystical experience that he was personally connected to Nichiren, to the primordial Buddha Śākyamuni, and to the eternal Dharma.\"\n\nToda believed that the wartime collapse of the Soka Kyoiku Gakkai was due to a weakness in the \"doctrinal discipline of its members.\" According to McLaughlin, upon his 1951 inauguration and declaration of \"The Great Shakubuku March,\" his first priority was quickly publishing doctrinal study materials. In preparation, he shifted the contents of his study lectures from explanations on the Lotus Sutra to studies on Nichiren's writings. He also created a Study Department consisting of 24 leading students who also gave local lectures.\n\nThe first product of the Study Department was \"Shakubuku kyoten\" (The Shakubuku Manual), published on Nov. 18th, 1951, which served to instruct members on how it exceeded other belief systems, and Makiguchi's theory of value. It spelled out the benefits of proselytizing and also provided detailed guidance about how to proselytize under different circumstances. The manual underwent eight editions and 39 printings, and included chapters on Makiguchi's theory of value and Toda's \"philosophy of life.\"\n\nThe second project Toda undertook was the collection of the extant writings of Nichiren. Throughout its 700-year history, Nichiren Shoshu, although claiming it was the orthodox teaching of Nichiren, had not produced its own canon of Nichiren's writings and had to rely on collections produced by other sects. Often these collections omitted writings of Nichiren the sect deemed as essential, such as the \"Ongi Kuden\" (The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings). Toda offered to sponsor a definitive publication of Nichiren's writings based on the take of Nichiren Shoshu. The work was completed in less than a year by members of the Study Department under the supervision of Nichiko Hori, the retired 59th high priest of Nichiren Shoshu. The resulting one-volume compilation, \"Shimpen Nichiren Daishonin gosho zenshu\" (New Edition of the Complete Writings of Nichiren Daishonin), was published on April 28, 1952, to commemorate the 700th anniversary of Nichiren's proclamation of his teachings in 1253, and \"remains Sōka Gakkai’s most important source for its Nichiren Buddhist practice.\"\n\nSoon after his inauguration, Toda created a section called the \"Young Men's Division\" on July 11, 1951. Its inaugural meeting consisted of 187 members who were divided into four \"corps.\" Among the attendees was Daisaku Ikeda who was to become Toda's successor. In Toda's speech he outlined his vision that the young men would lead his propagation campaign, comparing them to the youth who were the vanguard of the Meiji Restoration. The \"Young Women's Division\" was formed on July 19, 1951 with seventy members organized into five corps.\n\nAccording to McLaughlin, this was Toda’s second key initiative toward achieving his propagation goal: \"attracting and mobilizing a youth base ... charged with primary responsibility to achieve the spread of \"kosen rufu\".\" \n\nThe aggressive propagation style of the Youth Division, which also employed military-sounding organizational terms including \"corps commander\" and \"staff office,\" drew increasingly alarmist press coverage. In addition to propagating the religion to neighbors, Youth Division members challenged other sects to religious debates. Though their propagation efforts were depicted by one scholar as \"belligerent, activist, and ideological\", the Youth Division grew exponentially, reaching a 10,390 members by the end of 1954.\n\nAccording to McLaughlin, Toda's third initiative for the Great March of Shakubuku was creating a vision of Buddhism that is practical and attainable. To the people of the tumultuous post-war period, Toda used language that was optimistic and focused on progress. He spoke in an intuitive rather than esoteric way, for example referring to the Gohonzon as \"a happiness-producing machine.\" He spoke to the real problems members were facing such as economic woes, illness, and family discord, stressing the fundamentals of chanting daimoku and conversion.\n\nShimazono states that the doctrines developed by Toda represent a significant departure from the theology of the Nichiren Shoshu sect as well as of the Gakkai's founder, Makiguchi. Toda's vision, reshaping the traditional teachings of Nichiren Shoshu, was one of this-worldly salvation similar to other modern and popular Buddhist movements. Toda stressed that practice of Nichiren Buddhism, of which propagation efforts were an essential component, would result in secular benefits. In fact, he stressed that faith must be actualized through victories in daily life.\n\nMembership grew rapidly under Toda's leadership, to more than 750,000 households by December 25, 1957, just months before his death on April 2, 1958.\n\nScholars have put forth different theories to account for Toda's success in building the Soka Gakkai. The media have pointed to aggressive propagation which sometimes resulted in violent removal of other religious artifacts from the homes of new members. The author questions, in contemporary terms, whether forced activities could result in the spontaneous actions needed to sustain a campaign.\n\nOther scholars point to the success in finding a willing and sympathetic substratum of society to serve as its base. Toda made repeated references to \"the poor and the sick,\" making it evident that his propagation campaign was aimed at such people and, Murata concludes, \"And evidently, for many of them, their new faith worked.\" Media impressions also portrayed the Soka Gakkai as \"a conglomeration of lower social elements —the working class, the less educated, the low in status.\" According to Dower, after the war the Japanese population displayed a \"kyodatsu condition,\" a mass state of personal and collective disorientation and depression characterized by war-weariness, sickness, malnutrition, numbness, and despair as many people poured into cities in search of work and food. To these people Toda's reconceptualization of Buddha with life force and his focus on Buddhism as a transformative force in culture and politics had appeal which resulted in rapid growth in the early 1950s.\n\nWhite, on the other hand, recognizes the unique personality of Toda and its effect on youth: to them he was \"the great master, the transmitter of the teachings, the commander and guide.\" Metraux emphasizes Toda's ability to empathize with and counsel the suffering people of his time; he had strong organizational abilities and work ethics. Seager highlights the unique fit between Toda and a new generation of youth that enabled the Soka Gakkai to develop into a dynamic force, more specifically, the relationship between an ailing Toda and an energetic Ikeda.\n\nToda's imprisonment informed his stance on peace. On February 17, 1952, for example, Toda introduced his concept of \"chikyu minzoku shugi,\" variously translated as \"global nationalism\" or \"one-worldism.\" Urbain suggests that a modern-day equivalent would be \"global citizenship,\" by which Toda advocated a worldview that prioritizes the interests of humanity above the interests of the state. \n\nAddressing an assembly of 50,000 Soka Gakkai youth members on September 8, 1957, Toda issued a declaration for abolishing nuclear weapons as his will to future generations. At little more than a page of text, it was a succinct statement to the effect that there is neither victor nor humanity in any nuclear confrontation, overturning the Cold War logic of nuclear deterrence and its underlying denial that \"we, the citizens of the world, have an inviolable right to live.\" This “Toda Declaration,” proclaiming nuclear weapons to be “the ultimate evil of mankind, our numbed and remorseless readiness to deprive others of their inviolable right to live,” remains the guiding principle of the Soka Gakkai peace movement. \n\nIn discussing the Russell-Einstein Manifesto with Daisaku Ikeda, Sir Joseph Rotblat characterized Toda's denunciation of nuclear arms as a \"moral approach.\" Toda's analysis and approach toward nuclear disarmament have gained traction and form.\n\nToda adopted an aggressive method of proselytizing, based on shakubuku (折伏), \"as an 'active' way to bring the 'true faith' to all in the shortest possible time,\" or a method described as \"to criticize and to convince\". It resulted in widespread criticism in the popular press and also by other Buddhist sects. By some accounts, overenthusiastic members were responsible for excessive activities despite the cautions of Toda.\n\nOther scholars are skeptical of the interpretation that the growth of the Soka Gakkai under Toda's leadership could be simply ascribed to forced conversion. Some point to the organization's growth as the product of Toda's organizational acumen. During the rebuilding years of 1945–50 Toda reassembled prewar members, changed the organization's name to Soka Gakkai, developed organizational infrastructure, and began laying a foundation for propagation.\n\nUrbain attributes the rapid growth of the Soka Gakkai amidst the chaos of post-war Japan to Toda's authenticity stemming from his spiritual awakenings in prison, his \"personality and conviction,\" and his ability to relate to individuals through personal dialogue and the small discussion groups as his mentor had done.\n\nToda's programmatic approach to doctrinal teachings and organizational form as well as his keen social observations created a proselyting movement that was characterized as both militant and vigorous yet highly successful throughout the organization's rapid growth period. Toda was also effective in incorporating the powerful imagery of classical literature into his discussions and actions. For example, Toda named the young men select training group he formed the \"Suiko Kai,\" Water Margin Club, named after the novel attributed to Shi Nai'an, one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, written in vernacular Chinese rather than Classical Chinese. His intention was to inspire the group of young men to aspire the group of 108 heroic outlaws depicted in the novel. He encouraged the young men in this group and the young women in the accompanying \"Kaiyo Kai\" group to read classical works such as Hugo's Ninety-Three, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Caine's The Eternal City, Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo, and Gogol's Taras Bulba. In this vein, in October 1954, Toda is said to have made a speech to over 10,000 Gakkai members while mounted on a white horse, proclaiming: \"We must consider all religions our enemies, and we must destroy them.\"\n\nA case in point was Ikeda's conversion through his meeting Toda in 1947. Disaffected by the imperial state's war propaganda, Ikeda was apparently impressed by the fact that Toda went to prison for his beliefs as much as Toda's reflective clarity of message in their encounter.\n\nIn 1997, Ikeda clarified that the method of propagation of Nichiren Buddhism depends upon the locality and the times, and that in dialogue with other faiths, \"Our task is to bring forth the inherent goodness in people's hearts and, based on the concerns we share as human beings, work together in our own capacities for peace and happiness.\"\n\nToda's relationship with Nichiren Shoshu went through many ups and downs throughout his Soka Gakkai presidency.\n\nToda began his presidency with a determination to build closer cooperation with Nichiren Shoshu even though his appraisal of the school was at times critical. He often spoke of \"bad priests\" and his wartime experiences led him to conclude that his faith was stronger than that of some of the priests. On May 12, 1951, Toda requested from High Priest Nissho a special gohonzon for attaining the organization's goal of propagation which was bestowed on May 20, 1951 and enshrined in the Soka Gakkai headquarters. On November 18, 2013 this gohonzon was moved and enshrined at the newly constructed \"Hall of the Great Vow\" near the Soka Gakkai's headquarters in Tokyo; members from around the world visit and chant to this gohonzon.\n\nIn particular Toda was extremely critical of Jimon Ogasawara, an ultranationalist priest Providing context to the prewar situation, Montgomery explains: \"During the Pacific War, most religions supported the militaristic policies of the Japanese government. While some religions did so in order to avoid political oppression, it seems that in the end most religions in Japan became permeated with the ultranationalistic spirit and supported the war effort rather voluntarily. In particular, the Nichiren tradition of Buddhism produced thinkers such as Chigaku Tanaka or Jimon Ogasawara, who, drawing on the political aspects of Nichiren’s teaching, created ultranationalist ideologies legitimizing Japanese military policies of expansionism and colonization. These ideologies were then adopted by many Japanese religions. Reiyukai. which, through schismatic movements, produced many New Religions, such as Rissho Koseikai, was one of those religions which embraced Tanaka’s ideology and, thus, avoided wartime oppression.\" Ogasawara also articulated an amalgam of Buddhism and Shintoism, claiming that Buddhist deities were only manifestations of the true Shinto deities, thus placing Shinto superior to Buddhism. By supporting Ogasawara's ideology, Nichiren Shoshu managed to avoid the wartime government's goal of unifying all Nichiren groups. Toda held that Ogasawara was the one primarily responsible for the government repression of the Soka Kyoiku Gakkai, his and Makiguchi's imprisonment, and, ultimately, Makiguchi's death. In 1942 Ogasawara was expelled from Nichiren Shoshu.\n\nOne incident occurred in 1952 which tarnished the reputation of the young Soka Gakkai movement. On the eve of April 28, 1952, a special commemorative event was held at the head temple to honor the 700th anniversary of Nichiren's declaration of his school with 4,000 Soka Gakkai members in attendance. As it turns out, Ogasawara had been secretly readmitted to the priesthood without the knowledge of the Soka Gakkai and was present at the event. When Ogasawara's presence was discovered, a group of 47 young men, with the participation of Toda and Ikeda, confronted him and demanded an apology for his wartime actions. Holte conjectures that 47 youth were chosen to draw a parallel to the Japanese tale of the Forty-seven Ronin. During this confrontation Ogasawara kicked Toda and Toda struck him twice. Ogasawara refused to apologize for his actions during the war or recant his doctrines.\n\nThe young men then seized Ogasawara, tore off his priestly robe, and forcibly carried him to Makiguchi's grave with a placard inscribed \"Tanuki Bozu\" (Raccoon Monk) placed on him. Under duress he signed a letter of apology at the gravesite. Ogasaware filed a complaint with the authorities against Soka Gakkai for assault and battery and later a complaint against the high priest. After Toda's apology, and with Ogasawara's lawsuit against Nissho, public sentiment turned against him and he withdrew both complaints.\n\nAdditional accounts of the incident provide more details. Brannen notes that Toda was temporarily banned from entering the temple. Shimada informs that though no legal action was taken, this incident helped establish a public view of the organization as a violent cult., a reputation which has abated over the years. The Soka Gakkai has never denied the factual events of the story but has provided its own narrative about the incident. Ikeda gives an almost 40-page explanation of the incident in The Human Revolution, his fictionalized biography of Toda.\n\nThe incident did not strain relationships between Toda and Nichiren Shoshu for a long time. The day following the incident, April 28, 1952, Toda published the first edition of the New Edition of the Complete Works of the Great Sage Nichiren (Shinpen Nichiren Daishōnin gosho zenshū), a single-volume collection of Nichiren's writings that continues to serve as the organization's primary source for its Buddhist practice. Several months later, in November 1952, Nissho, the high priest of Taiseki-ji, reprimanded Toda for the April 27th incident. Toda responded with an article entitled \"Apology\" printed in the Soka Gakkai's newspaper. In May 1955 Ogasawara issued a pamphlet in which he repented his indiscretion in having had the unfortunate conflict with the Soka Gakkai. As time went on Nichiren Shoshu prospered as never before in its history due to financial support from the Soka Gakkai and pilgrimages by members.\n\nIn 1952 the Soka Gakkai was legally registered as a religious organization in Japan, overcoming some initial resistance from Nichiren Shoshu clerics. At the end of that year, at the seventh Soka Gakkai general meeting, Nichijun Horigome, who was to become the 65th high priest of the order, stated,\"I entrust the great propagation of the Law to the members of the Soka Gakkai.\" \n\nStarting in 1954 Toda financed and donated to Nichiren Shoshu the first three of many local temples. He provided funding for the restoration of Taisekiji's Five-Storied Pagoda and the Somon Gate. In 1955 he constructed on the Taisekiji site the Hoan-den to house the Dai Gohonzon and the Grand Lecture Hall in 1958. (The latter building was demolished by Nichiren Shoshu in 1995.) On New Year's Day 1956 Nichijun made highly complimentary statements about the Soka Gakkai Toda had built.\n\nDespite his support for Nichiren Shoshu, Toda kept a wary eye on priests. In 1951 he tells in his own hand, in an essay entitled \"The History and Conviction of the Soka Gakkai,\" his experience before the war, his realizations during his imprisonment, his efforts to rebuild the Soka Gakkai, and his concerns for the future. In this essay he expresses praise for Nissho, the high priest at that time, but also issues strong cautions about degenerate priests.\n\nToda died on April 2, 1958. Nichijun, at the eighth general meeting of the Soka Gakkai held one month later, eulogized Toda stating: \"It was President Toda who, as their leader, called forth those bodhisattvas; it was in the Soka Gakkai that they gathered. In other words, it was President Toda who manifested the five and seven characters of Myoho-renge-kyo as 750,000 [bodhisattvas].\"\n\nToda died on 2 April 1958 while the funeral was held at his home and the coffin was afterwards carried to the Nichiren Shōshū Jozai-ji temple in Ikebukuro, where he was buried. Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and the Education Minister Matsunaga attended the Soka Gakkai funeral held in Tokyo on April 20, where 250,000 members from Japan and overseas gathered Event news coverage asserted that although the two government officials were not members, \"they bowed to some two million voters behind the altar.\" For two years after Toda's death, there was a leadership vacuum and the Gakkai had no president, as it was unclear if anyone was able to replace him.\n\nAfter the war Josei Toda transformed the Soka Gakkai into \"a national phenomenon,\" increasing its membership exponentially and positioning it as \"a grassroots social movement that championed peace and the rights of ordinary people.\" Although the movement was derided as one composed of \"the poor and sick,\" Toda taught his members that such criticism was a source of pride. Toda revitalized the traditional teachings and practices of Nichiren Shoshu so they became vital for people in the modern age.\n\nToda firmly aligned the Soka Gakkai movement with a commitment to peace in the secular world.\n\nToda is recognized by scholars to be the primary influence on Ikeda. In turn, Ikeda describes the impact of Toda on his life in numerous published dialogues he has conducted with leading intellects.\n\nA number of awareness-raising initiatives by Soka Gakkai International and its president can be traced back to Toda's 1957 call for the sake of \"we, the citizens of the world\" to ban both nuclear arms and the logic behind their existence. These initiatives include: the exhibit \"Nuclear Arms: Threat to Our World,\" created in the 1980s with support from the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; the campaign People's Decade for Nuclear Abolition, launched in 2007 with the exhibit \"From a Culture of Violence to a Culture of Peace: Toward a World Free From Nuclear Weapons\"; and the exhibit \"Everything You Treasure – For a World Free From Nuclear Weapons,\" launched in 2012 at the 20th World Congress of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War with support from the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.\n\nToda's call for nuclear disarmament currently takes institutional form in the Toda Institute for Global Peace and Policy Research which was founded in 1996 by Ikeda. The institute promotes peace research through the organization of conferences, the publication of books, and of the yearly journal Peace & Policy. The Toda Institute focuses on three main themes: Human Security and Human Rights, Dialogue and Nonviolent Conflict Transformation, and Global Governance and World Citizenship. It seeks concrete solutions to three main issues: Abolition of Nuclear Weapons, UN Reform, and Sustainable Peace through Environmental Integrity and Social Justice.\n\nToda's experiences in prison as well as his efforts to build the Soka Gakkai are chronicled in two films by Japanese film director Toshio Masuda, the 1973 film The Human Revolution (Ningen Kakumei) and a 1976 sequel, The Human Revolution II (Zoku Ningen Kakumei), both starring produced by Toho.\n\n\n"}

It is widely distributed and lives in warm or tropical open seas.\n\nThe pilot fish congregates around sharks, rays, and sea turtles, where it eats ectoparasites on, and leftovers around the host species; younger pilot fish are usually associated with jellyfish and drifting seaweeds. They are also known to follow ships, sometimes for long distances; one was found in County Cork, Ireland, and many pilot fish have been sighted on the shores of England. Their fondness for ships led the ancients to believe that they would navigate a ship to its desired course.\n\nThe pilot fish's color is between dark blue and blackish-silver, with the belly being lighter in color. The pilot fish is also known to have a temporary variation of color when excited; its dark-colored bars disappear, and its body turns silvery-white, with three broad blue patches on its back. It can be recognized by its five to seven distinctive traverse bands, which are of a much darker color than the rest of the body. The pilot fish can grow up to 60–70 cm in length.\n\nThe pilot fish is edible and is said to taste good, but it is rarely available due to its erratic behavior when caught.\n\nWhile pilot fish can be seen with all manner of sharks, they prefer accompanying the oceanic whitetip, \"Carcharhinus longimanus\". The pilot fish's relationship with sharks is a mutualist one; the pilot fish gains protection from predators, while the shark gains freedom from parasites. It was often said by sailors that sharks and pilot fish share something like a \"close companionship\"; there were even tales of this fish following ships which had captured \"their\" shark for up to six weeks and showing signs of distress in its absence.\n\nWhatever the veracity of such reports, it is extremely rare that a shark will feed on a pilot fish, and smaller pilot fish are frequently observed swimming into sharks' mouths to clean away fragments of food from between their teeth. As Herman Melville put it,\n\nThese observations have led to the pilot fish's distinctive markings being copied for decals supplied as shark protection for surfboards.\n\nThere are a few possible, conflicting etymologies for the term \"pilot fish\". One is that seafaring people believed that pilot fish, which would appear around the bow of their ships when they were close to land, were leading (or piloting) them back to port. An alternative etymology is that pilot fish were once, erroneously, thought to be piloting sharks to food, or even (as legends have it) piloting ships, whales and swimmers to safety.\n\nIn Greek mythology a sailor called Pompilos helped the nymph Okyrhoe when she was fleeing away from the god Apollo. The sailor moved the nymph from Miletus to Samos and the god punished him by making him a pilot fish.\n\nThe pilot fish is sometimes used as a metaphor or simile; \"they are like the pilot fish to the shark, serving to lead him to his victim\". Pilot fish are also used as a metaphor or simile for scavengers or looters which accompany a greater threat.\n\nIn the BBC science fiction series \"Doctor Who\", the pilot fish were used in analogical terms for a robotic species who congregated around more dangerous life-forms, such as the Sycorax and the Racnoss. They appeared three times in the series; twice with David Tennant in \"The Christmas Invasion\" (2005) and \"The Runaway Bride\" (2006), and once with Matt Smith in \"The Pandorica Opens\" (2010).\nIn the Discworld novel \"Making Money\", during a conspiracy to entrap Moist von Lipwig, Heretofore reflects on his current predicament and uncomfortable relationship with Cosmo Lavish and says \"Does he think he's Vetinari? What do they call those fishes that swim alongside sharks, making themselves useful so they don't get eaten? That's me, that's what I'm doing, just hanging on, because it's much safer than letting go.\"\n\nErnest Hemingway bitterly immortalised John Dos Passos as a \"pilot fish\" for the wealthy in \"A Moveable Feast\", after falling out with him over the Spanish Civil War.\n\n"}

The competition was held originally scheduled from July 21, 1908 to July 23, 1908. The rerun of the final was held on July 25, 1908. The races were held on a track of 536.45 metres= mile in circumference.\n\n37 runners from ten nations competed. NOCs could enter up to 12 athletes.\n\nIt was the most controversial event of the London Games. The final resulted in the disqualification of American runner John Carpenter who was accused by the British officials of a manoeuvre that was legal under American rules (under which Carpenter normally competed) but prohibited by the British rules under which the race was run.\n\nAs part of the disqualification of Carpenter, a second final race was ordered. Halswelle was to face the other two finalists again. These athletes, William Robbins and John Taylor, were both Americans and decided not to participate in the repeat of the final to protest against the judges' decision.

Roscoe Badger, one of the British umpires of the event, noticed Carpenter maneuvering so as to prevent Halswelle from passing him, which was legal at the time under the American rules under which Carpenter normally competed, but prohibited by the British rules that were in effect for the Olympics; Badger therefore signalled to the judges to declare the race void, leading to a thirty-minute argument between British and American team members. At the official inquiry later that day, the judges disqualified Carpenter and ordered the final to be rerun with Carpenter excluded.\n\n\nCarpenter was not permitted to start in the rerun, and Robbins and Taylor refused to participate in protest of the decision by the judges.

The lyrics were by bassist Geezer Butler, and vocalist Ozzy Osbourne has referred to the song as \"heartbreaking\". Quite different from Sabbath's previous work, the song was described as a \"forlornly pretty\" ballad by critic Barney Hoskyns. It was inspired mainly by Bill Ward's breakup with his first wife.\n\n\"We're certainly not going to get any less heavy,\" Ozzy promised in 1972. \"We will probably do 'Changes' on stage with a Mellotron but we'll never take strings on stage with us or anything like that.\"\n\nThe song was performed live in 1973 but very seldom in years following.\n\nThe song was covered by soul artist Charles Bradley on his 2016 album called \"Changes\".

He has won eight times on the PGA Tour.\n\nFaxon was born in Oceanport, New Jersey and raised in Barrington, Rhode Island. He attended Furman University, and earned a Bachelor of Economics degree in 1983.\n\nAt Furman, Faxon was a two-time All-American (1982, 1983) as a member of the golf team. He played on the 1983 Walker Cup team. Faxon won the Haskins Award for the most outstanding collegiate golfer in the United States in 1983. He also received that same year's Golf Magazine and NCAA Coaches Awards as the nation's outstanding amateur golfer. He turned professional in 1983.\n\nFaxon has won eight times on the PGA Tour and played on two Ryder Cup teams. While admittedly not a great driver of the golf ball or a great ball-striker, Faxon has built a reputation as one of the best pure putters in golf history. He led the PGA Tour in Putting Average in 1996, 1999, and 2000 (when he set the single-season record with only 1.704 putts/greens in regulation), and finished 13th in 2005 at the age of 44. Faxon explains his success on the greens thus: \"My only secret is confidence... I just try to hit every putt as if I've just made a million in a row.\"\n\nFaxon had been one of the most successful players on the PGA Tour throughout the 1990s, a mainstay in the top 20 of the Official World Golf Rankings, but a knee injury began to hamper his effectiveness in 2003, causing him to suffer through his worst season in 14 years in 2004. Faxon bounced back in 2005, though, winning his first tournament in four years and finishing 45th on the PGA Tour Money List. On September 19, 2005, he underwent surgery to repair torn ligaments in his right knee. Faxon returned to competition for the 2006 season, in which he earned over $500,000.\n\nIn addition to his success on the PGA Tour Faxon played quite well on the Australasian Tour. He won the 1993 Australian Open, finished second in the 1993 Air New Zealand Shell Open, and finished in third place at the 1995 Greg Norman Holden International.\n\nFaxon made his Champions Tour debut at the 2011 3M Championship, where he finished T-31. He won his first title in October at the Insperity Championship.\n\nIn addition to being one of the PGA Tour's top players over the past 25 years, Faxon is one of the game's most generous figures. In 1991, Faxon along with fellow Tour pro Billy Andrade, formed Billy Andrade/Brad Faxon Charities for Children, Inc., a non-profit organization that (as of 2005) has donated over $3 million to needy children in Rhode Island and southern Massachusetts. For their charity work, Faxon and Andrade were awarded the 1999 Golf Writers Association of America's Charlie Bartlett Award, given to professional golfers for unselfish contributions to society. Since 1999, Andrade and Faxon have also served as hosts of the CVS Charity Classic, a golf tournament held at the Rhode Island Country Club each June, whose proceeds benefit the two players' charity. He also co-chair's \"Button Hole\" with Andrade, a short course that serves as a teaching and learning center for children. Faxon also runs his own junior golf foundation.\n\nIn 2010, Faxon worked for NBC as an analyst on golf broadcasts during the season. It was announced in July 2014 that Faxon would be joining Fox in 2015 as an on-air commentator along with David Fay.\n\nIn 2014, Furman University announced the school was going to discontinue the golf program.

The term \"covering set\" is used only in conjunction with sequences possessing exponential growth.\n\nThe use of the term \"covering set\" is related to Sierpinski and Riesel numbers. These are odd natural numbers for which the formula (Sierpinski number) or (Riesel number) produces no prime numbers. Since 1960 it has been known that there exists an infinite number of both Sierpinski and Riesel numbers (as solutions to families of congruences based upon the set ) but, because there are an infinitude of numbers of the form or for any , one can only prove to be a Sierpinski or Riesel number through showing that \"every\" term in the sequence or is divisible by one of the prime numbers of a covering set.\n\nThese covering sets form from prime numbers that in base 2 have short periods. To achieve a complete covering set, Wacław Sierpiński showed that a sequence can repeat no more frequently than every 24 numbers. A repeat every 24 numbers give the covering set , while a repeat every 36 terms can give several covering sets: {3, 5, 7, 13, 19, 37, 73}; {3, 5, 7, 13, 19, 37, 109}; {3, 5, 7, 13, 19, 73, 109} and {3, 5, 7, 13, 37, 73, 109}.\n\nRiesel numbers have the same covering sets as Sierpinski numbers.\n\nCovering sets are also used to prove the existence of composite Fibonacci sequences (primefree sequence).\n\nThe concept of a covering set can easily be generalised to other sequences which turn out to be much simpler.\n\nIn the following examples + is used as it is in regular expressions to mean 1 or more. For example, 913 means the set \n\nAn example are the following eight sequences:\n\nIn each case, every term is divisible by one of the primes .

Illite is a secondary mineral precipitate, and an example of a phyllosilicate, or layered alumino-silicate. Its structure is a 2:1 sandwich of silica tetrahedron (T) – alumina octahedron (O) – silica tetrahedron (T) layers. The space between this T-O-T sequence of layers is occupied by poorly hydrated potassium cations which are responsible for the absence of swelling. Structurally, illite is quite similar to muscovite with slightly more silicon, magnesium, iron, and water and slightly less tetrahedral aluminium and interlayer potassium. The chemical formula is given as , but there is considerable ion (isomorphic) substitution. It occurs as aggregates of small monoclinic grey to white crystals. Due to the small size, positive identification usually requires x-ray diffraction or SEM-EDS (automated mineralogy) analysis. Illite occurs as an altered product of muscovite and feldspar in weathering and hydrothermal environments; it may be a component of sericite. It is common in sediments, soils, and argillaceous sedimentary rocks as well as in some low grade metamorphic rocks. The iron rich member of the illite group, glauconite, in sediments can be differentiated by x-ray analysis.\n\nThe cation-exchange capacity (CEC) of illite is smaller than that of smectite but higher than that of kaolinite, typically around 20 – 30 meq/100 g. \n\nIllite was first described for occurrences in the Maquoketa shale in Calhoun County, Illinois, US, in 1937. The name was derived from its type location in Illinois.\n\nIllite is also called hydromica or hydromuscovite. Brammallite is a sodium rich analogue. Avalite is a chromium bearing variety which has been described form Mt. Avala, Belgrade, Serbia.\n\nThe crystallinity of illite has been used as an indicator of metamorphic grade in clay-bearing rocks metamorphosed under conditions between diagenesis and low-grade metamorphism. With increasing temperature, illite is thought to undergo a transformation into muscovite.\n"}

The family settled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he attended public schools and graduated from Central High School in 1902. He spent a year at Brown Preparatory School, also in Philadelphia, where he was the fastest high school quarter-miler in the country. As a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania, he was the ICAAAA (Intercollegiate Association of Amateur Athletes of America) champion in the quarter mile. He bested his personal time in 1907, and again was the ICAAAA quarter mile champion. He graduated from Penn's School of Veterinary Medicine in 1908, and was a member of Sigma Pi Phi, the first black fraternity. He was recruited by the Irish American Athletic Club in New York, and was its most prominent African American member.\n\nTaylor was a member of the gold medal-winning men's medley relay team at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London. He ran the third leg, performing the 400 meters. He followed William Hamilton and Nate Cartmell (fellow athletes from the University of Pennsylvania) and was followed by Mel Sheppard (a fellow athlete from Brown Preparatory School). In both the first round and the final, Taylor received a lead from Cartmell and passed one on to Sheppard. The team won both races, with times of 3:27.2 and 3:29.4. Taylor was the first African American to win an Olympic gold medal. His split for the final was 49.8 seconds.\n\nHe advanced to the finals in the men's 400 metres race at the 1908 Summer Olympics, winning his preliminary heat with a time of 50.8 seconds and his semifinal with 49.8 seconds. In the first running of the race, Taylor came in last place out of the four runners. However, teammate John Carpenter was disqualified after being accused of obstructing British runner Wyndham Halswelle and the race was ordered to be repeated without Carpenter. He still ran to the finish, Taylor and fellow American William Robbins didn't refuse to compete in the second final. They all reluctantly ran the second final , with a time of 50 seconds, and was awarded the gold medal.\n\nLess than five months after returning from the Olympic Games in London, Taylor died of typhoid fever on 2 December 1908 at the age of 26. He is interred at Eden Cemetery in Collingdale, Pennsylvania. In his obituary, \"The New York Times\" called him \"the world's greatest negro runner.\"\n\nIn a letter to Taylor's parents, Harry Porter, fellow Irish American Athletic Club member and acting President of the 1908 U.S. Olympic Team wrote: \"It is far more as the man (than the athlete) that John Taylor made his mark. Quite unostentatious, genial, (and) kindly, the fleet-footed, far-famed athlete was beloved wherever known...As a beacon of his race, his example of achievement in athletics, scholarship and manhood will never wane, if indeed it is not destined to form with that of Booker T. Washington.\" \n\n\n"}

C.\" Robbins (August 9, 1885 – July 30, 1962) was an American athlete and a member of the Irish American Athletic Club. He was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1908 he was involved in a controversial race in the final of the Men's 400 metres and was later part of a team which broke the world's record for the one mile relay.\n\nRobbins advanced to the finals in the 400 metres race at the 1908 Summer Olympics, winning his preliminary heat with a time of 50.4 seconds and his semifinal in 49.0 seconds. In the first running of the final race, Robbins finished in front. However, teammate John Carpenter was disqualified after being accused of obstructing British runner Wyndham Halswelle and the race was ordered to be repeated without Carpenter. Robbins and fellow American John Taylor refused to compete in the second final in protest of Carpenter's disqualification. Halswelle ran the race alone, and was presented with the Gold medal. This race is the only case of a walkover in Olympic history.\n\nAccording to Robbins' 1910 trading card, he was \"one of the best quarter-milers in the United States. He was... (a) Cornell University student, and first came to prominence by the part he played in the 400-meter race held at London in 1908. 'Yank,' as he (was) called by his team mates, ran the first 300 yards at such a clip that it 'pulled the great Halswell's cork,' the later finishing in third place. Robbins won the Metropolitan Amateur Athletic Union quarter-mile championship in September, 1909, and two weeks later captured the Canadian quarter-mile title, running the distance in the great time of 48 4/5 seconds.\"\n\nAt the Amateur Athletic Union metropolitan championships held at Travers Island in 1909, Robbins was part of the Irish American Athletic Club's four-man relay team that broke the world's record for the one mile relay, with a time of 3 minutes 20 2/5 seconds. The other three men on the record breaking team were; C.S. Cassara, James Rosenberger and Melvin Sheppard.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2034236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2034236", "title": "Organization XIII", "text": "Organization XIII\n\nThe concept of the Organization was originally introduced in \"Kingdom Hearts Final Mix\" within a bonus ending titled \"Another Side, Another Story [deep dive]\", where their Japanese name was translated as the \"Thirteenth Order\". The group was later introduced as the \"Organization\" in the game \"\", where they serve as the main antagonists, and returns in the same role in \"Kingdom Hearts II\". Organization XIII is prominently featured in \"Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days\" as characters available for play, along with a new female member named Xion. Several members, prior to becoming Nobodies, appear in \"Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep\", return following their restoration in \"\", and have returned in \"Kingdom Hearts III\".\n\nThe group was moderately well received by reviewers. Comments focused on their difficulty as adversaries and mysterious nature, which fueled expectations of future titles. Roxas specifically received press comments, focusing on his introduction in \"Kingdom Hearts II\".\n\nThe Organization XIII characters were created by Tetsuya Nomura, director of the series, and other members of his development staff. The concept began with Xemnas as the first member and Roxas as the last. Each of the original members' name is an anagram of their original name prior to becoming a Nobody, with the addition of the letter \"X\" which is revealed in \"Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep\" to be derived from the χ-blade. The members are depicted to wear black, hooded coats that shield them from the corrosive effect of prolonged use of the Corridors of Darkness, portals they use to traverse various worlds. The emblem associated with the Nobodies and Organization XIII was designed to look like a splintered heart as a complement to the Heartless emblem. Nomura tried to portray the characters ambiguously, rather than explicitly good or evil. Throughout the games' development, Nomura has often left certain plot holes and relations regarding Organization XIII characters—along with the series' other characters—unexplained until the release of a sequel; feeling that games should give fans room to speculate and use their imagination. \n\nIn \"Chain of Memories\", the staff had several of the Organization's members defeated as part of the plot. While Nomura intended to have those members be fought at Olympus Coliseum in the \"Kingdom Hearts II\", he dropped the idea due to time constraints and later applied it to \"Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix\" and remakes in the form of optional \"Absent Silhouette\" boss fights where the player fights defeated Organization members. Since the battles were optional, the difficulty levels of the fights was increased and the \"Chain of Memories\"-exclusive characters were given previously unseen powers. After working with the first game, Nomura gained interest in including the Mushroom XIII Heartless, most of which served to yield rare items in the game. This interest continued during the development of \"Kingdom Hearts II\", as he intended to add new variants of \"Mushroom\" Heartless in the game. Consequently, they are featured in the \"Final Mix\" release as the \"Mushroom XIII\", thirteen Heartless wearing the same black cloaks that also mimic traits of the Organization XIII members. For \"358/2 Days\", the developers believed the Organization and its large number of characters was a good fit for the intended multiplayer gameplay. Once the group was decided to be a central part of the gameplay, the staff felt Roxas's role as a member would be a suitable theme for the plot. \n\nSeveral former members appear in \"\", having regained their hearts following the destruction of their Heartless and Nobodies. In both the game and \"Kingdom Hearts III\", revealed to be its true leader, Master Xehanort proceeds to create Organization XIII as it was meant to be: The Thirteen Seekers of Darkness with Xigbar and Saïx. Enlisting under false pretenses to reconstruct Roxas to fight them, Vexen uses the Replica technology to create vessels for Xehanort's time displaced incarnations while the recreated Demyx, Luxord, Marluxia, Larxene, Vanitas, and Xion are made into thralls like Saïx.\n\nRevealed to be one of the scenarios Master Xehanort devised, the Organization was established when Terra-Xehanort turned himself, his supporter Braig, and the disciples of Ansem the Wise into Nobodies with Terra-Xehanort's Nobody Xemnas as the group's leader. Originally numbered at eight, the Organization recruited a quartet of Nobodies, who were hand-picked by Xehanort as their original selves were time-displaced Keyblade users from the aftermath of the Keyblade War, before recruiting Roxas as their final member with Xion as an unofficial member. Each member is given a cloak made of a special material that allows them to pass through the Corridors of Darkness into other worlds safely without being attacked by the Heartless there. Members are given titles indicating both their role in Organization XIII and their personality, as well as their own breed of lesser Nobodies to control, usually suited to their fighting style and unique themed powers. As Nobodies, they lack emotion and morality, and are unable to feel guilt and remorse for their actions. However, most of the members' personalities are based from what memories they have of their original selves. Six of the Organization's members were introduced in \"Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories\", with the remaining members introduced in \"Kingdom Hearts II\". In \"Chain of Memories\", the series' protagonist Sora and his friends Donald Duck and Goofy are led to a mysterious fortress called Castle Oblivion by Marluxia, who intends to turn Sora into his pawn by manipulating his memories. Sora's friend Riku also arrives at Castle Oblivion, but in the basement where he encounters other Organization members. Sora and Riku traverse the levels of the castle to reach the top, fighting and defeating several members along the way. By \"Kingdom Hearts II\", the actions of Sora and Riku, along with Roxas' resignation, reduce the Organization to seven members, who seek to use the power of Kingdom Hearts—a repository of knowledge and power, and the source of all hearts—to become complete beings.\n\nThe events of the game \"Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance\" reveal that the true purpose of Organization XIII is for Master Xehanort—the true incarnation of Xemnas' human form—to divide his heart among the bodies of its other members, effectively transforming them into clones of Xehanort so he may recreate the χ-blade using their thirteen hearts of darkness and seven hearts of light. It is also revealed that Nobodies such as those in the Organization are capable of developing hearts of their own over time, but are deceived by Xemnas into thinking they lack hearts so they can cooperate with his plans. Though this agenda is not realized for various reasons, a new Organization XIII is formed from various incarnations of Xehanort from across time, including Xemnas, \"Ansem\", and members who succeeded in becoming \"half Xehanort\". This gathering is accomplished by a younger version of Xehanort that is granted the power of time travel by his future self, though they have a final member to recruit as they attempted to make Sora their thirteenth member.\n\n is the leader of the original Organization XIII, ranked first as the . First appearing in \"Kingdom Hearts Final Mix\" as an optional boss labeled , he is identified as the Nobody of Terra-Xehanort, originally Terra who became a host for Xehanort's heart, while his name is derived from Xehanort's alias \"Ansem\". He uses the power of nothingness to phase through solid matter and wield a pair of \"ethereal blades\", two red beams of light generated from his palms. He also commands the \"Sorcerer\" Nobodies.\n\nXemnas serves as the main antagonist of \"Kingdom Hearts II\", where he gathers the hearts released by Roxas's Keyblade to cultivate his own version of Kingdom Hearts in the World That Never Was. When Roxas defects from the Organization and surrenders his existence to Sora, Xemnas manipulates Sora into completing the task instead. \"Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix\" features additional cutscenes that highlight Xemnas's other agendas which, according to Nomura, are influenced by Terra's memories. These include his secret conversations with Aqua's discarded armor preserved in the self-built \"Chamber of Repose\" in Hollow Bastion, as well as his search for the \"Chamber of Waking\", a secret room hidden within Castle Oblivion that houses Ventus' comatose body. His plans are thwarted when Ansem the Wise damages Kingdom Hearts and releases the accumulated hearts in his attempt to encode them within a machine. When Sora's party refuses to aid in its restoration, Xemnas uses what is left of Kingdom Hearts' power to assume multiple forms, eventually separating Sora and Riku from their allies. The two defeat him and Xemnas fades into nothingness.\n\nThe secret ending of \"Kingdom Hearts Re:coded\" reveals that Xemnas's destruction alongside his Heartless counterpart has resulted in Xehanort's restoration to human form. Xemnas also returns as one of the primary antagonists of \"\", brought from the past by Young Xehanort to serve on the new Organization XIII as he reveals the truth nature of Organization to Sora before taking him for an attempt of converting him into the group's final member. Xenmas is ultimately defeated in \"Kingdom Hearts III\", feeling loneliness and regret over manipulating his former comrades while expressing some respect for Sora for being strong enough to move past sorrow.\n\n is the Nobody of , a guardsman at Radiant Garden and collaborator with Xehanort prior to the Organization's formation. Bearing the title of , he wields a pair of rayguns called \"arrowguns\" that can be combined to form a sniper rifle. He also commands the \"Sniper\" Nobodies, and manipulates space to teleport himself, levitate, and alter his surroundings in battle. He is Xemnas's second-in-command, and is privy to Xemnas's various private agendas due to eavesdropping. At various points across the series, Xigbar taunts Sora by commenting on his angry glare, saying that \"he used to give me that same exact look\"; Sora's expression reminds him of Ventus whom Roxas bears a resemblance to. He would be revealed to be the ancient Keyblade Master .\n\nMaking his first chronological appearance in \"Kingdom Hearts χ\", Luxu is the sixth apprentice of the Master of Masters who acted on his mentor's final request to observe the Keyblade War and protect the Black Box while passing the \"No Name\" Keyblade across the generations to the one who would bring about a second war. Luxu fulfilled observing the Keyblade War by influencing discontent among the Foretellers, with Ava's attempted attack on him over their master's Lost Page commencing the event. From there, Luxu used a technique to transfer his heart into another body to prolong his life to see \"No Name\" reaches its destined user. He eventually assumes the identity of Braig and finds Xehanort during the events of \"Birth by Sleep\", feigning ignorance to be the Keyblade Master's right hand. Braig aids in Xehanort's plan to provoke Terra into unleashing inner darkness, resulting in his face being scarred, his right eye being damaged, and being infused with part of Xehanort's heart before dueling Aqua in the Keyblade Graveyard while observing Ventus's glare for the first time. Braig proceeds to oversee the next phase of Xehanort's plan while monitoring the apparent amnesic Terra-Xehanort who later attacked and turned him into Xigbar. \n\nIn \"358/2 Days\", Xigbar discovers Xion's true nature as a Replica before the other members, mocking Roxas with this knowledge. Throughout \"Kingdom Hearts II\", Xigbar confuses Sora by making cryptic allusions to Roxas and the previous Keyblade wielders. During their battle at the World That Never Was, he mystifies Sora one last time by calling Roxas, refusing to explain himself as he is defeated and fades away. Xigbar's destruction restores Braig to human form by the events of \"Dream Drop Distance\", where he reappears in his Nobody identity as one of Xehanort's chosen \"seekers of darkness\", revealing himself to be a willing vessel for Xehanort's heart which has gradually transformed him into \"half Xehanort\". Following Xehanort's defeat in \"Kingdom Hearts III\", Luxu discards his cover while reclaiming the \"No Name\" Keyblade to proceed with the next phase of his master's request by first summoning four of the five Foretellers to the present.\n\nThe telescopic sight sequence of Xigbar's boss battle underwent some content edits in the English release of \"Kingdom Hearts II\". Before the sequence, Xigbar combines his two guns into a sniper rifle in the Japanese release, which was changed to him twirling his weapons and shooting with a single gun. But the original animation was kept in the English release of \"Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix\". The reticle was also changed from a crosshair within a circular scope to three glowing circles.\n\n is the Nobody of Ansem's guardsman , introduced in \"Kingdom Hearts II\" as the original Organization's number three. He is nicknamed the , using wind to manipulate his six lances. He commands the lance-wielding \"Dragoon\" Nobodies. Becoming a Nobody to be free of emotion, Xaldin understands the setbacks of lacking a heart, but keeps a clear disdain towards people who follow their hearts, developing a particular obsession towards the Beast from \"Beauty and the Beast\". Xaldin primarily appears at the Beast's Castle in \"Kingdom Hearts II\" and \"358/2 Days\", where he attempts to manipulate the Beast's rage to create a powerful Nobody and Heartless for the Organization. He later steals the Beast's enchanted rose and kidnaps Belle to stoke the Beast's rage, but his plans fail when Belle escapes with the rose. Xaldin is vanquished by Sora, which results in his restoration as Dilan in \"Dream Drop Distance\", reportedly still unstable alongside the revived Even. In \"Kingdom Hearts III,\" Dilan returns to his original post as guardsman.\n\n, originally named , is a mad scientist and researcher of the heart. Also known as the , he has the power to control ice and carries a large shield in battle. As revealed in \"358/2 Days\", Vexen oversees the Organization's \"Replica Program\", which deals with the production of artificial human replicas such as Xion. In \"Chain of Memories\", Vexen occupies the basement of Castle Oblivion with Lexaeus and Zexion, whom he sides with to prevent Marluxia's plan to overthrow the Organization. He battles Riku in order to gather data to create a replica of him, and allows Naminé to manipulate the replica's memories to test Sora's worth. Later, Vexen fights Sora himself with the intention of revealing Marluxia's plan to him. As a result, Marluxia declares Vexen a traitor and sends Axel to kill him, which Axel does to gain Marluxia's trust and prevent him from using Vexen's replica research. Despite Vexen's demise resulting in Even being restored in \"Dream Drop Distance\", Even is made into a member of Xehanort's Organization by the events of \"Kingdom Hearts III\", revealed to have rejoined to regain access to the Replica Program and redeem himself by providing Xion, Roxas, and Naminé with new bodies to exist in.\n\n, the original Organization's fifth member who is also known as the , is the Nobody of , a castle guard at Radiant Garden. His weapon is an \"axe sword\", a massive battle axe with an extended blade that he uses to shatter rocks and shake the area itself with his elemental power of earth. In the \"Reverse/Rebirth\" story mode of \"Chain of Memories\", Lexaeus and Zexion seek to counter Marluxia's plans to overthrow the Organization with Sora by using Riku in the same fashion. When they believe that Sora might fall into Marluxia's grasp, Lexaeus confronts Riku directly, trying to convince him to open himself up to the power of the darkness in his heart. After Riku defeats him in the original \"Chain of Memories\", the mortally wounded Lexaeus releases all of the darkness within himself to consume Riku. In \"Re:Chain of Memories\", Lexaeus is instead killed when Xehanort's Heartless possesses Riku to personally finish Lexaeus off. Lexaeus's demise leads to his revival as Aeleus in \"Dream Drop Distance\", informing Lea that Dilan and Even are resting due to still being unstable, and that Braig and Xehanort are still missing. In \"Kingdom Hearts III,\" Aeleus returns to his original post as guardsman.\n\n is the Nobody of , Ansem's youngest apprentice, who appears as an orphaned child during the events of \"Birth by Sleep\". As the original Organization's sixth member, also known as the , he uses illusions to mimic others' appearances and create duplicates of himself. Zexion does not use a weapon in his original appearance in \"Chain of Memories\", with the game's remake revealing his weapon to be a lexicon. Appearing in \"Reverse/Rebirth\", Zexion initially plans to use Riku against Marluxia and his co-conspirators. After Sora defeats Marluxia, Zexion attempts to dispose of Riku by drawing him into a simulation of the Destiny Islands, where Zexion attacks him under the guise of Sora. However, Naminé's intervention allows Riku to cut through Zexion's illusion and accept the power of darkness. Zexion retreats, only to be killed by Vexen's replica of Riku at the encouragement of Axel, who determines Zexion to be an obstacle for his and Saïx's own agenda. Zexion's death leads to the revival of an adult Ienzo in \"Dream Drop Distance.\" In \"Kingdom Hearts III\", Ienzo acts as an ally to Sora in his mission to restore Roxas, which he achieved once reunited with Ansem the Wise. Ienzo, Even, and Ansem would later resurrect Naminé via the Replica Program.\n\n, also known as the , is Xemnas' right-hand man with an X-shaped facial scar who wields a claymore and uses the power of the moon to assume a berserk state of mind. He was originally a resident of Radiant Garden named and Lea's best friend who met Ventus during the events of \"Birth By Sleep\". During a successful attempt to sneak into the castle, they found and befriended an imprisoned girl designated \"Subject X\", who was being used for Ansem the Wise's experiments. Isa and Lea periodically visited Subject X before attempting to rescue her one day but she had disappeared. Isa joined Lea in an endeavor to become apprentices to Ansem the Wise to find out what happened to Subject X, which led to Isa becoming Saïx. Saïx had Axel help him climb the Organization's ranks to become Xemnas' second-in-command in the hopes of finding clues to Subject X's whereabouts. However, his cold and ruthless personality as a Nobody and obsession of restoring himself as a complete being strained his friendship with Axel; furthermore, Saïx grew jealous of Axel's friendship with Roxas and Xion, and saw it as an act of betrayal against him and Subject X as he came to believe Axel had abandoned them.\n\nIn \"358/2 Days\", Saïx assigns missions to other Organization members and is tasked by Xemnas to oversee the progress of Xion, whom Saïx disregards as a failed experiment. He also conspires with Axel to gain leverage over Xemnas by assassinating the members stationed at Castle Oblivion until Axel develops a friendship with Roxas and Xion, which causes Saïx to feel betrayed. Towards the end of the game, Saïx attacks Roxas for attempting to leave the Organization, only to lose to the younger Nobody. Saïx encounters Sora at various points in \"Kingdom Hearts II\" to goad him into destroying more Heartless, eventually explaining Sora's purpose in the Organization's plans to him. He also reveals Kairi to be the Organization's hostage in order to further motivate Sora. At the World That Never Was, Saïx attempts to stop Kairi from escaping with Naminé but he is forced to retreat by Riku. Later, Saïx draws power from the lunar form of Kingdom Hearts to fight Sora but he is defeated and fades into darkness. Saïx's death results in his return to human form in Radiant Garden but he's taken by Braig and Young Xehanort not long after. In \"Dream Drop Distance\", he appears as one of Xehanort's thirteen \"seekers of darkness\" necessary for the creation of the χ-blade. In \"Kingdom Hearts III,\" Saïx talks to Vexen in the Keyblade Graveyard, asking why the latter chose to give up his restored humanity and become a Nobody again. He later meets with Lea on Twilight Town's clock tower the day before the battle and they discuss Subject X. In the Keyblade Graveyard, Saïx battles Sora's group and makes amends with Lea by confessing his feelings of jealousy and abandonment before peacefully fading away in Lea's arms. He is later restored as Isa again and joins Lea, Roxas, and Xion in Twilight Town before going to Destiny Islands with them to celebrate their victory against Xehanort. At one point, it's confirmed by Marluxia that Saïx is the one who invited Vexen back into the Organization, which is also confirmed in Secret Report 7. In his scene with Demyx, Vexen implies that he's acting on Saïx's behalf in a shared goal for atonement and that Roxas' revival was Saïx's idea. This was also confirmed in the \"Kingdom Hearts III Ultimania\", which revealed that Saïx rejoined the Organization to make amends for the misery he had caused Axel, Roxas, and Xion.\n\n, originally a Radiant Garden citizen named , is the Organization's resident assassin who is entrusted with killing the group's traitors and was the original Organization's number eight. He is also the best friend and mentor of Roxas, whose relationship with him enables Axel to re-experience human emotion as a Nobody. Nicknamed the , he uses the power of fire manipulation to emblaze his chakrams, and he commands the \"Assassin\" Nobodies. He frequently utters the phrase, \"Got it memorized?\", which he does to achieve his own ideal of immortality through other people's memories. Years before becoming Axel, Lea was Isa's childhood friend and he befriended Ventus, whose appearance Roxas emulated due to their connection to Sora, during the events of \"Birth By Sleep\". When he and Isa snuck into the castle, they found a secret area underneath and befriended a girl being held there called \"Subject X\", who was being used for Ansem the Wise's experiments. As Lea and Isa continued to visit Subject X, Lea was determined to save her but one day she had disappeared. Lea and Isa attempted to find her by becoming apprentices to Ansem the Wise but this led to Lea's transition to Axel as he and Saïx, Isa's Nobody, were inducted into the Organization but remained true to their intentions of finding Subject X and regaining their humanity. \n\nAxel is one of the members that Sora encounters at Castle Oblivion in \"Chain of Memories\", where he acts as a double agent within Marluxia and Larxene's attempted coup against the Organization. The events of \"358/2 Days\" reveal his actions at Castle Oblivion to be part of own conspiracy with Saïx to gain leverage over the Organization, which Axel eventually abandons in favor of pursuing his friendship with Roxas and Xion over the course of the game. Upon learning of Xion's true nature as a replica created by the Organization to absorb Roxas, Axel reluctantly allows her to escape, which results in Roxas's defection from the group. In \"Kingdom Hearts II\", he is ordered to retrieve and later kill Roxas, but Roxas defeats him and merges with Sora, although the two friends reconcile. Axel later kidnaps Kairi in an effort to lure Sora, intending to turn him into a Heartless and reunite with Roxas. After Saïx takes Kairi on the Organization's behalf, Axel performs a suicide attack against a swarm of Nobodies to save Sora, apologizing for his actions as he fades away. Axel's sacrifice restores him to his human form as Lea in \"Dream Drop Distance\", although those familiar with his Nobody still address him as Axel, to his grudging acceptance. Lea sets out to find the missing Braig and Isa, helping Riku and Mickey Mouse rescue Sora from Xehanort's Organization XIII. Lea reveals he had acquired a Keyblade, requesting Yen Sid to teach him to use it alongside Kairi. In \"Kingdom Hearts III\", Lea, still determined to bring back Roxas, continues his Keyblade training with Kairi. By the time it's completed, Lea is reunited with the revived Ventus before going to the clock tower in Twilight Town. He is joined by Saïx and the two talk about how their involvement with Subject X led them to where they are now. In the Keyblade Graveyard the following day, Lea, Kairi, and Sora fight Saïx and an unknown hooded Organization member. He is heavily injured by Xemnas and almost killed by the hooded girl until Sora stops her and calls her Xion. Xenmas kicks them back, causing the Xion's hood to reveal her face and Lea's memories of her to return. Xemnas almost kills Xion but is stopped by the return of Roxas. After Saïx is defeated by Sora, Roxas, and Xion, Lea makes amends with him before Saïx fades away in his arms. Reunited with Roxas and Xion, Lea helps Sora and the others defeat Master Xehanort and close Kingdom Hearts. After Xehanort's demise, Lea, Roxas, Xion, and the revived Isa sit together on the clock tower before joining the others on Destiny Islands.\n\nNomura designed Lea/Axel based on a similar concept as Reno from \"Final Fantasy VII\"; Nomura wanted to see what it would be like to have a similar character in a different role and world. In \"Birth by Sleep\", Nomura included a scene where protagonist Ventus—whose appearance is deliberately identical to Roxas's—encounters Axel's human counterpart, which he hoped would convey the character's importance to newcomers and older players of the franchise.\n\n is the Organization's reconnaissance agent who is also referred to as the , being the Nobody of an ancient Keyblade wielder that Xehanort picked. He behaves as an easygoing and self-professed slacker, and has a noted lack of combat skill. His weapon is a sitar that he uses to control water and create duplicates of himself, and he commands the \"Dancer\" Nobodies. He is encountered in the underworld at the \"Hercules\"-inspired world of Olympus Coliseum, where he reluctantly fights Sora to elicit a response from Roxas, who had fused with Sora. He battles Sora's party again at Hollow Bastion after they enrage him by mocking his nature as a Nobody, but he is defeated and fades into darkness. He also appears in \"358/2 Days\", where he frequently tricks Roxas into doing his work on missions, only participating out of fear of being transformed into a Dusk. Demyx appears in \"Kingdom Hearts III\" as one of the real Organization's members but is \"benched\" as a member, kept as a reserve vessel for Xehanort's heart. He later conspires with Vexen to aid in the resurrection of Roxas via the Replica Program.\n\n is a courteous gambler nicknamed the who speaks in rhetoric and gaming-related metaphors, being the Nobody of an ancient Keyblade wielder that Xehanort picked. He controls the \"Gambler\" Nobodies, and he uses a deck of playing cards as his weapons. He also has power over time, and can transform Sora into a card or gaming die. He appears before Sora's party in \"Kingdom Hearts II\" when he invades the world known as \"The Caribbean\", using the cursed Aztec gold to produce a powerful Heartless. He later faces Sora in a timed, game-like battle at the World That Never Was and, upon being defeated, accusingly calls out to Roxas within Sora while fading away. Luxord also appears in \"358/2 Days\", where he accompanies Roxas on various missions to Wonderland, based on the 1951 film \"Alice in Wonderland\". He appeared in \"Kingdom Hearts III\" as a member of Xehanort's Organization, offering his services to Davy Jones during his second invasion of the Caribbean, before his eventual defeat while giving Sora a \"wild card\" that might help him later.\n\n, also known as the , he uses a scythe and power over flowers to produce flurries of petals and energy-based attacks with command over the \"Reaper\" Nobodies. Marluxia is the Nobody of , an ancient Keyblade wielder and member of the Dandelions during the events of \"Union χ\"; hints of his former self manifested in him unconsciously naming his scythe after his younger sister Strelitzia. Despite being one of the Organization's newer members, he is given lordship of Castle Oblivion in recognition of his profound abilities where he serves as the main antagonist of \"Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories\".\n\nPlotting to use Sora and Naminé to overthrow the Organization, Marluxia lures the former to Castle Oblivion and gives him a set of cards to progress, allowing Naminé to manipulate Sora's memories and enslave him. He collaborates with fellow members Larxene and Axel, assigning the latter with eliminating Vexen to prevent him from revealing Marluxia's plan to Sora. However, Axel ultimately betrays them by releasing Naminé. Following Larxene's death, Marluxia kidnaps Naminé and orders her to erase Sora's memories so he can rebuild Sora into his pawn, but she refuses. Marluxia battles Sora using an illusion of himself, and later while fused to a massive Nobody, but is defeated and dissolves into darkness. Marluxia makes a minor appearance in \"358/2 Days\", where he expresses his interest in Roxas's Keyblade while training him, and considers including Roxas in his and Larxene's alliance shortly before being sent to Castle Oblivion. Marluxia returns in \"Kingdom Hearts III\" as one of Xehanort's vessels, reintroducing himself to Sora as a member of the Organization due to the youth having no memory of him while targeting Rapunzel. After being defeated by Sora in the Keyblade Graveyard, Marluxia begins regaining his emotions and memories and thanks Sora before fading away.\n\n, the , is a ruthless and sadistic female member of the Organization who wields a set of knives and the power of lightning to fight along with command over the \"Ninja\" Nobodies. Larxene is the nobody of , an ancient Keyblade wielder and member of the Dandelions who knew Strelitzia and Lauriam during the events of \"Union χ\". Larxene first appeared in \"Chain of Memories\" as Marluxia's co-conspirator for control of the Organization, helping to manipulate Sora's memories by causing him to remember Naminé's name. After Larxene discovers Axel's betrayal and sees that Marluxia's plans have fallen apart, she decides to reveal her and Marluxia's plans to Sora with the intention of killing him. However, Donald and Goofy arrive to assist Sora, and the three defeat Larxene, who fades into darkness. She makes a minor appearance in \"358/2 Days\" as a tutor of Roxas, whom she refuses to include in her and Marluxia's alliance due to frustration with his lack of experience. Larxene returns in \"Kingdom Hearts III\", serving as one of Xehanort's vessels while targeting Elsa until confirming that both Elsa and Anna are among the New Seven Hearts. With Luxord and Marluxia, Larxene is defeated by Sora and claims to have only gotten involved with the Organization because she was \"just along for the ride\" with someone but doesn't reveal who.\n\n is Sora's Nobody, the Organization's thirteenth member, and commander of the \"Samurai\" Nobodies, bearing the title of . Born during the events of the first game when Sora becomes a Heartless to restore Kairi's heart, Roxas possesses the ability to wield a Keyblade, for which he is inducted within the Organization to further their goal of collecting hearts, until he decides to abandon the Organization to discover his origins. He is the main player-controlled character of \"Kingdom Hearts II\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s prologue sequence, and serves as the main protagonist of \"Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days\", which further explores his membership in the Organization up until the events of \"Kingdom Hearts II\".\n\n is the fourteenth member of Organization XIII, introduced in \"358/2 Days\". First appearing as a featureless, hooded figure, she comes to form her own identity during her time spent working alongside Roxas, bonding over their similarities such as a lack of memories of their past lives and an ability to wield a Keyblade. She eventually comes to forge a strong friendship with Roxas and Axel. After Riku makes her question her own existence, Xion discovers that she is a Replica—an artificial human—designed to absorb Sora's scattered memories following the events of \"Chain of Memories\" and duplicate Roxas's powers as a fail-safe for the Organization's plan, and is not counted as an official member of the Organization. Her physical appearance differs among those who see her, with her most prominent form resembling Kairi, who embodies Sora's most precious memories. Because her existence prevents Sora from awakening, Xion is initially torn between staying with her friends and merging with Sora, but she chooses to sacrifice herself when she begins draining Roxas's power. However, she is recaptured and forced to fight Roxas in order to absorb him and become a perfect copy of Sora. After Roxas defeats her, she asks him to release the stolen hearts from Kingdom Hearts before she returns to Sora, erasing all memory of her from those she has encountered. She makes minor appearances in \"Birth by Sleep\", \"Coded,\" and \"Dream Drop Distance\", showing her to still exist within Sora's heart.\n\nIn \"Kingdom Hearts III\", Xion is revived by Vexen through his Replica Program as the final member of the real Organization XIII. Lea slowly begins to recall his friendship with Xion, through his interactions with Kairi. Xion participates in the second Keyblade War against the Guardians of Light. Though at first complicent in aiding Xemnas, Xion finds herself unable to harm Lea. She sides with Sora upon Roxas' revival, reuniting with her friends. Following Xehanort's defeat, Xion befriends Hayner, Pence, Olette, and Isa, and is present on Destiny Islands when Sora fades from existence.\n\nXion was conceptualized during development of \"Kingdom Hearts II\" in which the staff wanted to explain the reason why Roxas left Organization XIII. Additionally, the staff wanted to create a new member from the cartel, but having a different nature from all the other members. Xion's name was coined by Tomoko Kanemaki, one of the scenario writers for \"358/2 Days\" and the author of the \"Kingdom Hearts\" novel series. Tetsuya Nomura took a liking to the name, noting that it corresponds to the Japanese words for , fitting the oceanic naming theme of Kairi and Naminé, and which, according to Japanese floriography, means \"I won't forget you\" or \"remembrance\". It is also revealed within the game's \"Secret Reports\" that her name is an anagram of \" \" and the letter X, the former being an imaginary unit.\n\nThe obscure nature of the Organization's activities throughout \"Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories\" and \"Kingdom Hearts II\" led reviewers to describe them as an \"ominous\" group that \"seems to be intent on guiding Sora and his friends to accomplish some dark purpose\". Similarly, Rice Burner of \"GamePro\" emphasizes this plot when reviewing the group's debut, noting how the \"strange inhabitants of the castle trap our heroes\" and \"force Sora on a ponderous journey into his own memories to face his subconscious thoughts and fears\". This mysterious perception is furthered by the fact that some members of Organization XIII present themselves as dark silhouettes with their faces covered, acting as an \"enigmatic robed and cowled figure speaking in riddles\". The questions surrounding the groups motivation and purpose have created great curiosity among players; Andrew Reiner of \"Game Informer\" included \"What secret lies behind Organization XIII?\" as one of the main questions that are answered and that serve as plot devices in \"Kingdom Hearts II\", creating situations that \"certainly give you shivers and make your heart leap\". Visually, the artwork of Organization XIII's members is based more on the styles of \"Final Fantasy\" rather than those of Disney. Bethany Massimilla of GameSpot referred to their models as \"very much cut from the \"Final Fantasy\" spiky-haired cloth\".\n\nWhile writing BradyGames' \"Kingdom Hearts II\" strategy guide, Beth Hollinger, Matt Berner, David Cassady and Grag Sepelak reviewed the role of Organization XIII's members as adversaries. Both Axel and Demyx were described as providing easier battles during their first encounters. The ones found later in the game were regarded as more difficult enemies, as is the case with Xaldin, Xigbar, and Saïx, the first of which were described as \"tough\" and \"tricky\" opponents respectively, while the ferocity of Saïx's \"Berserk\" attack was noted. Luxord's battle was considered one that \"brings something new to the table\", mostly based on the unique use of a \"Time\" parameter instead of the common system based on \"Health Points\". The various battles against Xemnas gathered different points of interest; during the first one, the writer praised the \"Facedown\" Reaction Command, while the final battle's focus is on its difficulty and the need of constantly using Reaction Commands to switch between Riku and Sora. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd noted in a preview of \"Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days\", that Xigbar's ranged magic proved helpful while fighting as an ally along Roxas.\n\nIndividually, the members of Organization XIII have received varied receptions. Jeff Haynes of IGN felt that Roxas was a \"likable kid\", and Ron Fahey of Eurogamer concurred, calling him a \"likeable enough young chap who just happens to be troubled by memories and visions of people he doesn't even know\". His playable involvement in the game was regarded as a transitional arc, being used to introduce the gameplay to players that are new to the franchise. Fahey also considered it a good introduction, as it lets the player become familiar with the basic elements in a manner that \"isn't a bad way at all of setting the scene for the game\". However, Reiner emphasizes his role as a \"troubled boy\", calling his story arc \"an amazing chain of events\", particularly noting that the revelation of his nature as a Nobody creates a \"devilish yet remarkable plot twist\" which may impact the player in a way that he \"may not want Sora back\". The introduction of Xion in trailers for \"Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days\", created expectation, particularly based on the facts that her face could not be distinguished and that she wields a keyblade. In the 2009 Nintendo Power Awards, the magazine's readers voted Xion the \"Best New Character\" of the year.\n"}

He competed at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, contributing to one of the many sporting controversies of the 1908 Games. \n\nJohn Carpenter was born in Washington, DC in 1884, the oldest child of noted travel writer Frank G. Carpenter and Joanna Carpenter (née Condict), and the brother of future author and folklorist Frances Carpenter. Carpenter traveled widely in the company of his family throughout his childhood, before matriculating at Cornell University, from which he graduated in 1907. Carpenter placed third in the 1908 collegiate national track and field championship 440 yard, while running for Cornell.\n\nHe advanced to the finals in the men's 400 meters race at the 1908 Summer Olympics after winning his preliminary heat with a time of 49.8 seconds and his semifinal in 49.4 seconds. In the first running of the final race, Carpenter came in first out of the four runners, clocking 47,8 seconds. However, umpire Roscoe Badger determined that Carpenter had willfully interfered with British runner Wyndham Halswelle. Though the obstructing maneuver was then legal under American rules, the Olympic contests were held under British rules, which did not allow it. Carpenter was disqualified and the race was ordered to be repeated without him. His countrymen, John Taylor and William Robbins, protested the ruling by boycotting the second final, leaving Halswelle to take the gold medal uncontested in the only walkover in the modern Olympic history.\n\nThe disputed race was instrumental in the formation of the International Amateur Athletic Federation before the next Olympics, which sought to standardize the rules by which various sports played around the world. Additionally, judges were no longer provided by the host country but rather allocated from an international pool. As for the 400 meter sprint, following 1908, lanes were introduced to reduce incidents of runner-interference. \n\nCarpenter dropped racing after 1908 and went on to become a patent attorney and investment broker in Chicago. He married Laura Helen Elliott, and had three children, Frank George Carpenter, Marion Frances Carpenter, John Elliot Carpenter. He was hit and killed by a train in 1933.\n\n\n"}

Terry (1839–1882).\n\n\"Terry\" was laid down at Bath, Maine, on 8 June 1942 by the Bath Iron Works; launched on 22 November 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Charles Nagel, Jr., and commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on 26 January 1943, Commander George R. Phelan in command.\n\nAfter outfitting at Boston in February and shakedown training off Guantanamo Bay, the destroyer returned to Boston for post-shakedown availability. On 2 April, she shifted from Boston to Norfolk. Two days later, she headed north to NS Argentia, Newfoundland, in the screen of a convoy. \"Terry\" arrived there on the 8th and departed the following day. She stopped at Portland, Maine, on the 11th to refuel and, the following day, commenced antisubmarine operations off the northeastern coast of the United States.\n\nOn 18 April, she had a run-in with a German U-boat. First, \"Terry\" dropped a pattern of depth charges on a sound contact and waited for results. Then her sonar detected a torpedo running straight for her bow. \"Terry\" turned to avoid it, and the deadly missile passed astern. Soon thereafter, the destroyer sighted an oil slick and debris and ended the encounter by joining ) in a futile search for the damaged enemy submarine. On the 20th, the warship put into Narragansett Bay for a few hours to take on fuel and supplies before resuming patrol. She later rescued survivors of a downed Army bomber and put them ashore at New York City on 23 April.\n\nFollowing another brief patrol and a visit to New York City, \"Terry\" departed the United States on 1 May in the screen of Task Force 67, bound for North Africa. After a stop at Bermuda, the destroyer headed singly for Casablanca, where she arrived on the 12th and commenced a week of repairs and battle practice. On the 19th, she steamed out of Casablanca and headed homeward in company with . Arriving at the Boston Navy Yard on 31 May, the destroyer entered dry dock. She was refloated on 9 June and got underway the same day. She stopped briefly at Casco Bay, Maine, and at Norfolk, Va., before continuing on to the British West Indies. The destroyer reached Trinidad on 20 June and spent the ensuing nine days on antisubmarine patrols and in gunnery practice. She departed Trinidad on 29 June, bound for the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Almost at her destination on 3 July, she was ordered to report to Norfolk where she arrived the same day.\n\nThree days later, she put to sea in company with , , and . The three warships reached the Panama Canal on 10 July. Two days later, \"Terry\", \"Yorktown\", \"McKee\", and set out for Hawaii. They arrived in Pearl Harbor on the 24th, and \"Terry\" conducted exercises in the waters around Hawaii until mid-August. On 19 August, she departed Pearl Harbor for the southwestern Pacific. Steaming with and , she stopped at Suva, Fiji Islands, before arriving in Havannah Harbor, Efate Island, in the New Hebrides on 6 September. After a visit to Nouméa, New Caledonia, she returned to Efate briefly before taking up duty in the Solomon Islands late that month.\n\n\"Terry\" entered the torturous Solomons campaign late, in mid-September 1943. She saw only the final five months of the campaign and participated in its last two amphibious operations. Her primary missions during her tour of duty in the Solomons consisted of escorting supply convoys and interdicting Japanese barge traffic to keep the enemy from evacuating his bypassed and otherwise useless troops. Infrequently, she also left the Solomons area to visit New Caledonia, either escorting ships there or for availability.\n\nHer first combat in the Solomons came early in October. On the 2d, she was ordered up \"the Slot\" between Choiseul and Kolombangara along with , and . Their mission was to intercept barges loaded with enemy evacuees from Kolombangara. Before opening the attack, she and her three sister destroyers waited for the enemy to move well out from the island. They sighted their targets at 21:14. The four destroyers turned a wide circle to starboard and, five minutes later, opened fire.\n\n\"Terry\" fired one salvo, and her fire-direction radar went out. Three minutes later, she ceased fire and commenced repairs. Swiftly, her radarmen restored \"sight\" to her guns, and \"Terry\" resumed her barrage almost immediately. The enemy boats returned fire, but \"Terry\" and the other destroyers pounded them until they disappeared from the radar screen. A bit later, more barges, escorted by a \"Wakatake\"-class destroyer, hove into sight. \"Terry\" and her colleagues fired a salvo and launched a spread of torpedoes. The Japanese returned fire, but the torpedoes forced them to cease fire and alter course toward the American warships. Meanwhile, the American destroyers, who had also ceased gunfire in order to launch torpedoes, opened up again with their five-inch batteries. Enemy return fire grew increasingly weaker as they suffered heavily from the American cannonade. \"Terry\" claimed a straddle on her first salvo, and flashes on the enemy destroyer—thought to be return fire at first—indicated that \"Terry\"'s salvoes were hitting home. Apparently, Destroyer Division 8's guns had overwhelmed the enemy from the beginning. When the action ended, \"Terry\" set course for the Gizo Strait.\n\n\"Terry\" resumed escort and patrol duties until late in the month. By the beginning of November, she was steaming north again, escorting , and to Empress Augusta Bay for the Bougainville assault. On 1 November, the day preceding the landings at Cape Torokina, she and \"Fullam\" fended off an enemy air attack. The gun crews of the little convoy knocked down two of the intruders and scattered the rest. Early the following morning, the troops landed. \"Terry\" opened fire at 05:45 and continued to support the assault forces throughout the day. The destroyer cleared the area on 3 November and returned south to Florida Island off Guadalcanal.\n\nFor the next three months, \"Terry\" resumed her routine of escorting supply convoys and conducting patrols. She visited Bougainville often and patrolled the Russell and Treasury Islands. The destroyer also made two voyages to Nouméa. During the first two weeks in December, she had two scrapes with the enemy. On the 3rd, while steaming from Guadalcanal to Bougainville, she came under an almost simultaneous pair of attacks—one from below and one from above. A Japanese submarine fired two torpedoes at her, but she combed their wakes as they passed astern. At almost the same time, enemy fighters swooped in on her. They made several unsuccessful approaches and, after losing one plane to \"Terry\"s antiaircraft gunners, abandoned their attack. Eleven days later, she was again making the Bougainville run, and another Japanese plane attempted to attack. \"Terry\"s gunfire taught him better manners, and he retired rapidly.\n\nFollowing more patrols, escort duty, and an availability at Nouméa, \"Terry\" was ordered to cover the last major amphibious operation of the Solomons campaign. She departed Purvis Bay on 13 February 1944, in company with and . During the landings on 15 February, the three destroyers opened up on an enemy plane, but had to cease fire when he was intercepted by a Marine Corps fighter who \"scratched\" him. Later, \"Terry\" and a group of LSTs discouraged another Japanese plane, a dive bomber, from pressing home an attack. He remained at extreme range until deciding to clear the area. The destroyer left the Green Islands on 21 February and returned to Tulagi.\n\n\"Terry\"s next target was the large Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain in the Bismarck Archipelago. She stood out of Tulagi on 23 February, refueled in the Treasuries, and reached Rabaul just before dawn on the 25th. Her main battery pumped shells into the enemy shore installations in the Vunapore area for 23 minutes. By the time she cleared, at about 03:00, several explosions had engulfed the area in a raging fire visible 20 miles out to sea. Her division commander cancelled further bombardment in order to sweep the area of Duke of York Island for a downed pilot. At the conclusion of a futile search, she steamed to New Georgia.\n\n\"Terry\" remained in the Southwest Pacific theater for another three months. She screened the task group which carried out the unopposed seizure of Emirau Island on 20 March; then resumed normal patrols and escort duty. On 2 April, she rescued the survivors of a downed B-24. After a liberty call at Sydney, Australia, early in May, she steamed to Efate, where she arrived on the 13th. For the remainder of the month, she conducted exercises with Battleship Division 3, comprising , , and .\n\n\"Terry\" ended her tour of duty in the Southwest Pacific area early in June 1944 and joined the Central Pacific march. She departed Efate on the 2d with Task Group 53.14 (TG 53.14) bound for the Marshall Islands. At Kwajalein Atoll, she joined Admiral Raymond A. Spruance's awesome 5th Fleet. On the 10th, she sortied from the lagoon with elements of that fleet and headed for the Marianas. The first two objectives of the Marianas campaign were Saipan and Tinian. \"Terry\" was assigned to the Tinian portion of the operation. Her task unit had the dual responsibility of silencing enemy guns on northern Tinian and of rendering Ushi Point Airfield useless. She opened fire around 11:21 on the morning of 14 June, caused two large explosions, started several fires, and destroyed a radio tower—all at the airfield. That night, she delivered night harassing fire along the west coast of the island.\n\nOn the 15th, she returned to bombarding Ushi Point Airfield. Later that day, she and went to the aid of the troops ashore and silenced a Japanese mortar battery that had been responsible for a number of American casualties. Late in the afternoon, after an inconclusive brush with two Japanese planes, \"Terry\" retired with her task unit to protect the transports to the south. Before dawn on the 16th, the destroyer joined the screen of battleships \"Idaho\" and \"Pennsylvania\" and helped them pound Orote Peninsula on Guam for two hours.\n\nThat same day, Admiral Spruance began to concentrate his forces for the imminent Battle of the Philippine Sea. \"Terry\" was one of the destroyers detached from the screen of Rear Admiral Jesse Oldendorf's bombardment group to beef up TF 58's antiaircraft defenses. She joined the screen of TG 58.3 to protect , the veteran of the battle of Midway, along with Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher's flagship, , , and .\n\nSteaming just out of range of the American planes, the Japanese played cat and mouse with the 5th Fleet for three days, but Spruance declined to take the bait. Finally, on the 19th, the Japanese launched their attack. The first swarm of enemy raiders never made it to the American ships, and \"Terry\" did not sight a Japanese plane until 11:57 when four of them tried to come in over her quarter. The first, a dive domber, managed to lay his egg before crashing. The following three torpedo bombers—were not nearly so successful. They made themselves perfect targets approaching low across the destroyer's bow. \"Terry\"'s gunners teamed up with those of the other ships of the screen to splash each one in succession, before he had an opportunity to release his torpedo. For the remainder of the day, \"Terry\" saw only unidentified planes at extreme range. The only further excitement occurred just after 13:00, when she was rocked by an underwater explosion believed to have been caused by the depth charge of a downed plane.\n\nThe Battle of the Philippine Sea, nicknamed the \"Great Marianas Turkey Shoot\", destroyed the remnants of Japanese carrier-based air power. The occupation of Saipan and Tinian continued unimpaired. \"Terry\" operated with TG 58.3 until the 22d, when it was apparent that the Japanese were defeated and in full retreat. From that day, 22 June, to 12 July, \"Terry\" patrolled off Saipan and prowled for submarines. On one occasion, she dropped a pattern of 11 depth charges, but scored no kill. She cleared the Marianas and, on 15 July, entered Eniwetok lagoon. The destroyer patrolled the anchorage against submarines until 17 July when she got underway to return to the Marianas with the Guam invasion force.\n\nThe destroyer reached Guam on 22 July, the day after the initial landings, and supported the troops ashore until 10 August. First, she alternated night illumination fire with antisubmarine patrols. Later, she delivered call fire under the direction of spotters stationed ashore. Throughout this period, she delivered night harassing fire and guarded against enemy submarines. On her last day in the Marianas, 10 August, she stood radar picket duty and then sailed for Hawaii.\n\nAfter a stop at Eniwetok, the warship reached Pearl Harbor on 21 August. There, she made repairs and loaded supplies while her crew enjoyed a bit of shore leave. On 15 September, \"Terry\" stood out of Pearl Harbor bound for Eniwetok, where she arrived on the 30th. Three days later, she departed in the escort of a Ulithi-bound task unit, arriving on 13 October. From there, the destroyer headed back to the United States for overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard.\n\nShe completed overhaul on 13 December and conducted drills along the coast until the 18th, when she headed west in company with . After a brief stop at Pearl Harbor, \"Terry\" continued her voyage west and rejoined the 5th Fleet at Eniwetok on 5 February. Two days later, she sortied in the screen of the Iwo Jima assault force.\n\nOn the morning of 16 February, the destroyer rendezvoused with a group of minesweepers about nine miles south of Iwo Jima. A little after 10:00, she opened up on enemy gun emplacements in an effort to protect the minesweepers while they cleared the approaches to the beaches. At about 14:32, a Japanese 4 inch gun managed to straddle \"Terry\". She rang up speed to 25 knots (46 km/h) and lurched ahead while the enemy laid a barrage in her wake. Her 5 inch guns loosed their own salvoes which quickly silenced the offender. Thanks to \"Terry\"'s gunners, the minesweepers completed their task just after 16:00 without losses.\n\nThe destroyer cleared the island for the night but returned the following day and resumed counterbattery fire. After the landings on 19 February, she supported the troops ashore with gunfire during the day and screened the ships of Task Force 54 (TF 54) during the night.\n\nAt 02:45 on the morning of 1 March, \"Terry\" was assisting in a search for a Japanese submarine, when a low enemy torpedo plane approached her starboard bow. He dropped his torpedo about 1,000 yards from \"Terry\". The recognition officer spotted the intruder at precisely that moment and sang out \"Torpedo Away\". \"Terry\" leaped ahead at flank speed and came hard right. The torpedo passed harmlessly, 50 yards astern. By 07:20, \"Terry\" was heading for a screening station north of the island. As she passed Kitano Point on the northern coast of Iwo Jima, an enemy battery opened fire and got the destroyer's range immediately. \"Terry\" responded with her main battery. Her high speed and radical maneuvers did not spoil the enemy's aim and, although eventually silenced, the battery scored a direct hit on the destroyer's starboard main deck. The starboard engine stopped, and \"Terry\" lost steering control and telephone communications.\n\n\"Terry\" opened range with her port engine while , , and some destroyers put the shore battery out of action. Ships and boats swarmed to \"Terry\"'s aid. Medical personnel and repair crews came aboard in surprisingly short order. Her wounded received emergency treatment on board, then were transferred to hospital ships. \"Terry\" headed for the southern coast of Iwo Jima where she laid to for two days while undergoing emergency repairs. On 3 March, she cleared the Volcano Islands on the first leg of a long voyage back to the United States.\n\nAfter interim repairs at Saipan and stops at Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor, she returned to the Mare Island Navy Yard. During the next two months, she received permanent repairs and conducted drills along the California coast. On 13 June, she headed south and briefly conducted exercises in the San Diego area, before escorting to Hawaii. On 11 July, \"Terry\", \"Wasp\", and departed Pearl Harbor to rendezvous with TF 38. For the remaining weeks of the war, she screened the fast carriers during the final raids on the Japanese home islands.\n\nDuring the months immediately following the end of the war, \"Terry\" operated in the waters off Japan. She conducted patrols and acted as a courier for the occupation forces. On 1 November, she pointed her bow eastward and headed for home. After a stop at Pearl Harbor, she continued on to San Diego, Calif., where she arrived on 20 November.\n\nFor just over a year, \"Terry\" remained active with the Pacific Fleet, operating out of San Diego. In January 1947, the destroyer was placed out of commission and berthed with the San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet. \"Terry\" spent the remainder of her Navy career in reserve, first at San Diego, then at Long Beach, and finally at Bremerton, Wash. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 1 April 1974. She was sold to Peru 26 July 1974, and cannibalized for spare parts.\n\n\"Terry\" received seven battle stars for her World War II service.\n\n"}

The original edition was published by Jean-Baptiste Arban sometime before 1859 and is currently in print. It contains hundreds of exercises, ranging in difficulty. The method begins with basic exercises and progresses to very advanced compositions, including the famous arrangement of \"Carnival of Venice\".\n\nIn the Introduction J. B. Arban covers the range of the cornet (trumpet). He also details alternate fingerings and describes the use of the tuning slide. Arban states his opinion that the mouthpiece should be two-thirds on the lower lip and one-third on the upper. (Herbert Lincoln Clarke recommends the mouthpiece to rest half upper lip and half lower lip.) Arban then stresses the proper \"attack\" technique. He uses the \"tu\" pronunciation, which in French is said with the tongue in the \"tee\" position. Arban concludes with proper breathing technique (see diaphragmatic breathing).\n\nArban then begins his method with a focus on tone (Studies 1-10). The next studies (11-50) familiarize the student with fingerings, develop their range, and instill a habit of precision in attacking the notes. In the next section, which is devoted to syncopation, goes from a simple quarter-half-quarter rhythm to a sixteenth-eighth-sixteenth repeated rhythm. Next, Arban focuses on the dotted eighth-sixteenth and eighth-double sixteenth rhythms. He ends the First Studies with 10 studies on the 6/8 meter.\n\nProfessor Arban devotes the next section of his vast method to slurring or legato playing. He begins with simple slurs that are accomplished by the variation of valves. He suggests pronouncing \"taw-ee\" while playing. The editor recommends adding little more air on the top note. (Such a technique is also needed to accomplish trills.) Arban devotes half of this whole section, though, to lip slurs. He concludes this section with a series of advanced studies combining slurred and staccato playing.\n\nArban's series on scales includes studies of major, minor, and chromatic scales, as well as numerous variations thereof. Arban admits to giving minor scales \"limited treatment,\" but Gordon refutes this by citing the nonexistence of \"limits on the use of the Trumpet and Cornet.\"\n\nNext, Arban teaches the student the various ornaments that can be played on a trumpet or cornet. He details the simple appoggiatura, grace note (short appoggiatura), portamento, double appoggiatura, the turn, the trill, and the mordent. Arban concludes the fourth section by combining the various ornaments and integrating them into various tunes.\n\nThe \"more advanced studies\" include studies on intervals; broken octaves and tenths; triplets; the four-sixteenth rhythmic figure; major and minor arpeggios; the dominant seventh arpeggio; and cadenzas.\n\nNext, Arban focuses on triple tonguing, double tonguing, and fanfare tonguing. Arban uses various \"tu-ku\" pronunciation combinations, and Gordon subsequently replaces these with \"tee-kee\" combinations. In his studies on double tonguing, Arban includes a score of studies in which he combines double tonguing with slurs occurring on various beats and within them.\n\nThe Art of Phrasing was written by Arban in 1866, but was never added to the original French edition of the Method. These songs and duets first appeared in the American Edition of the Arban Method published by the Jean White Company in 1872. This new version added 28 duets entitled 28 Recreations, 32 Melodies, and 100 Art of the Phrasing songs. Carl Fischer and J.W. Pepper also added the Art of Phrasing to their Arban Methods in the late 1800s.\n\nAs in his other sections, Arban progresses from simple pieces to more challenging ones. All of these, however, require their performers to be synchronized with one another.\n\nBefore his final 12 fantasias, Arban provides 14 challenging characteristic studies. His concluding remarks preceding these are as follows: \nThose of my readers who…want to attain…perfection, should…try to hear good music well interpreted. They must seek out…the most illustrious models, and…purify their taste, verify their sentiments, and bring themselves as near as possible to that which is beautiful.\n\nThese passages are challenging and are longer than all of the previous sections' pieces. Each is a full page long (in the platinum edition), and they crescendo in difficulty as they progress; the fourteenth study is two pages long and the only piece in this section in time.\n\nIn addition to the eleven fantasias (fantasies) for B-flat cornets, there is one for the A cornet (\"Fantasie and Variations on Acteon\"). Arban's celebrated composition \"Fantasie and Variations on \"The Carnival of Venice\"\" is the eleventh fantasia in the list. The platinum edition of Arban's Method includes an accompaniment CD for the twelve fantasia. (Each accompaniment includes pauses for the various cadenzas in each song.)\n\n"}

He represented the state of São Paulo in the National Chamber of Deputies (the lower house of the National Congress) and ran for presidency three times. He was founder and leader of the nationalist and conservative Party of the Reconstruction of the National Order (PRONA), which was usually seen as being far-right.\n\nEnéas was born and raised in Acre, in Brazil's far west. He lost his parents at the age of nine and had to work to support his brothers. In 1958 he left Acre to begin studies in Rio de Janeiro, graduating in physics and mathematics. In 1959 he became an auxiliary anesthesiologist. In 1965 he received a medical degree from the Rio de Janeiro College of Medicine, with a specialty in cardiology. His academic pursuits, however, were not confined to medicine, and he has written articles on diverse subjects, including philosophy, logic and robotics. In 1980, he received a medical degree from the Cancer Hospital of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nIn 1985 he established PRONA. In 1989 he ran for the presidency in Brazil's first direct elections after the end of military rule. Under the electoral laws, every candidate was given a daily amount of free airtime to set out their agenda. As the amount of airtime was proportional to the candidate's party political size, PRONA only got roughly 15 seconds of airtime for each TV appearance. Nevertheless, he made the most of the opportunity. His exotic image – he was a small, bald man with a large beard and thick \"coke-bottle\" glasses — drew attention, as did his inflamed speech. In what would become his trademark, he finished it with the catchphrase \"Meu nome é Enéas\" (\"My name is Enéas\") — perhaps a gesture of humility or informality, or perhaps a way to save valuable time. The previously unknown politician was placed 12th out of a field of 21 candidates.\n\nHe returned in 1994, making use then of 1 minute and 17 seconds. Surprising political experts, he finished ahead of various established politicians, such as the then-governor of Rio de Janeiro (Leonel Brizola), the former governor of São Paulo (Orestes Quércia), and the then-governor of Santa Catarina (Esperidião Amin), with more than 4.6 million votes.\n\nIn 1998, Enéas got 35 seconds – less, in total airtime, than what he had in 1989 – to deliver a speech that was more nationalistic than ever. Its ideas, such as the construction of an atomic bomb, nationalization of Brazil's mineral resources, and increasing the military budget, sparked controversy. According to him, with such apparatus Brazil could impose its interests in the UN and other international treatises.\n\nHis project focused basically on education, believing that only a strong, interventionist and technical State would solve Brazil's problems. Although many may label him as an authoritarian, his political approach is similar to a social democracy like in Sweden and Finland for example, where the State is extremely important.\n\nIn 2000 he ran for mayor of the city of São Paulo, with no success, but he still managed to gain votes for the election of his councilman candidate Havanir Nimtz.\n\nIn 2002 he ran for a seat as a federal deputy, representing São Paulo, and secured the most-ever votes for that office. His party won enough votes, through the proportionality system, to elect five more deputies.\n\nEnéas also participated actively in elections for mayors and councilmen in 2004, helping to choose councilmen in some major cities, such as Rio and São Paulo, and mayors in small cities.\n\nIn 2006 he was elected again as a federal deputy for São Paulo, this time with the third highest vote in the state.\n\nMany saw Enéas as an exotic politician because of his direct criticism to Brazilians fraudulent politicians behavior. Enéas believed that by acting on TV what he called \"the rage of the common citizen\" would wake up Brazilian people against corrupt politicians.\n\nEnéas underwent chemotherapy in a hospital for myeloid leukemia. When it became clear that his treatment was not resulting in improvements, he decided to return home, where he remained until his death. Enéas died on May 6, 2007 at approximately 2 pm, in the Laranjeiras neighborhood of southern Rio de Janeiro. His remains were cremated and his ashes scattered over the Bay of Guanabara.\n\nAfter his death, on May 8, 2007, Enéas was honored in a rally against abortion in Brasília, on May 8, 2007. According to the Party of the Republic, the politician was one of the organizers of the event.\n\nCurrently, there is a bill proposed by Jair Bolsonaro which proposes to include Enéas' name in the Book of National Heroes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2034270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2034270", "title": "History of Newark, New Jersey", "text": "History of Newark, New Jersey\n\nNewark has long been the largest city in New Jersey. Founded in 1666, it greatly expanded during the Industrial Revolution, becoming the commercial and cultural hub of the region. Its population grew with various waves of migration in the mid 20th century, peaking in 1950. It suffered greatly during the era of urban decline and suburbanization in the late 20th century. Since the millennium it has benefited from interest and re-investment in America's cities, recording population growth in the 2010 census.\n\nNewark was founded in 1666 by Connecticut Puritans led by Robert Treat from the New Haven Colony to avoid losing political power to others not of their own church after the union of the Connecticut and New Haven colonies. It was the third settlement founded in New Jersey, after Bergen, New Netherland (later dissolved into Hudson County, then incorporated into Jersey City) and Elizabethtown (modern-day Elizabeth).\n\nThey sought to puny a colony with strict church rules similar to the one they had established in Milford, Connecticut. Treat wanted to name the community \"Milford.\" Another settler, Abraham Pierson, had previously been a preacher in England's Newark-on-Trent, and adopted the name; he is also quoted as saying that the community reflecting the new task at hand should be named \"New Ark\" for \"New Ark of the Covenant.\" The name was shortened to Newark. References to the name \"New Ark\" are found in preserved letters written by historical figures such as James McHenry dated as late as 1787.\n\nTreat and the party bought the property on the Passaic River from the Hackensack Indians by exchanging gunpowder, 100 bars of lead, 20 axes, 20 coats, guns, pistols, swords, kettles, blankets, knives, beer, and ten pairs of breeches.\n\nThe first four settlers built houses at what is now the intersection of Broad Street and Market Street, also known as \"Four Corners.\"\n\nThe total control of the community by the Puritan Church continued until 1733 when Josiah Ogden harvested wheat on a Sunday following a lengthy rainstorm and was disciplined by the Church for Sabbath breaking. He left the church and corresponded with Episcopalian missionaries, who arrived to build a church in 1746 and broke up the Puritan theocracy.\n\nIt took 70 years to eliminate the last vestiges of theocracy from Newark, when the right to hold office was finally granted to non-Protestants.\n\n\"First Landing Party of the Founders of Newark\" (1911) and \"Indian and the Puritan\" (1916) are two of four public art works created by Gutzon Borglum that are located in Newark comemmoraing the city's founding. They were added to the New Jersey Register of Historic Places on September 13, 1994, and the National Register of Historic Places on October 28, 1994 as part of a Multiple Property Submission, \"The Public Sculpture of John de la Mothe Gutzon Borglum, 1911–1926\".\n\nNewark's rapid growth began in the early 19th century, much of it due to a Massachusetts transplant named Seth Boyden. Boyden came to Newark in 1815, and immediately began a torrent of improvements to leather manufacture, culminating in the process for making patent leather. Boyden's genius led to Newark's manufacturing nearly 90% of the nation's leather by 1870, bringing in $8.6 million in revenue to the city in that year alone. In 1824, Boyden, bored with leather, found a way to produce malleable iron. Newark also prospered by the construction of the Morris Canal in 1831. The canal connected Newark with the New Jersey hinterland, at that time a major iron and farm area.\n\nRailroads arrived in 1834 and 1835. A flourishing shipping business resulted, and Newark became the area's industrial center. By 1826, Newark's population stood at 8,017, ten times the 1776 number.\n\nThe middle 19th century saw continued growth and diversification of Newark's industrial base. The first commercially successful plastic — Celluloid — was produced in a factory on Mechanic Street by John Wesley Hyatt. Hyatt's Celluloid found its way into Newark-made carriages, billiard balls, and dentures. Dr. Edward Weston perfected a process for zinc electroplating, as well as a superior arc lamp in Newark. Newark's Military Park had the first public electric lamps anywhere in the United States. Before moving to Menlo Park, Thomas Edison himself made Newark home in the early 1870s. He invented the stock ticker in the Brick City.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Newark's industry was further developed, especially through the efforts of such men as J. W. Hyatt. From the mid-century on, numerous Irish and German immigrants moved to the city. The Germans were primarily refugees from the revolutions of 1848, and, as other groups later did, established their own ethnic enterprises, such as newspapers and breweries. However, tensions existed between the \"native stock\" and the newer groups.\nIn the middle 19th century, Newark added insurance to its repertoire of businesses; Mutual Benefit was founded in the city in 1845 and Prudential in 1873. Prudential, or \"the Pru\" as generations knew it, was founded by another transplanted New Englander, John Fairfield Dryden. He found a niche catering to the middle and lower classes. In the late 1880s, companies based in Newark sold more insurance than those in any city except Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nIn 1880, Newark's population stood at 136,500 in 1890 at 181,830; in 1900 at 246,070; and in 1910 at 347,000, a jump of 200,000 in three decades. As Newark's population approached a half million in the 1920s, the city's potential seemed limitless. It was said in 1927: \"Great is Newark's vitality. It is the red blood in its veins – this basic strength that is going to carry it over whatever hurdles it may encounter, enable it to recover from whatever losses it may suffer and battle its way to still higher achievement industrially and financially, making it eventually perhaps the greatest industrial center in the world\".\n\nSanitary conditions were bad throughout urban America in the 19th century, but Newark had an especially bad reputation because of the accumulation of human and horse waste built up on the city streets, its inadequate sewage systems, and the dubious quality of its water supply.\n\nNewark was bustling in the early-to-mid-20th century. Market and Broad Streets served as a center of retail commerce for the region, anchored by four flourishing department stores: Hahne & Company, Bambergers and Company, S. Klein and Kresge-Newark. \"Broad Street today is the Mecca of visitors as it has been through all its long history,\" Newark merchants boasted, \"they come in hundreds of thousands now when once they came in hundreds.\"\n\nIn 1922, Newark had 63 live theaters, 46 movie theaters, and an active nightlife. Dutch Schultz was killed in 1935 at the local Palace Bar. Billie Holiday frequently stayed at the Coleman Hotel. By some measures, the intersection of Broad and Market Streets — known as the \"Four Corners\" — was the busiest intersection in the United States. In 1915, Public Service counted over 280,000 pedestrian crossings in one 13-hour period. Eleven years later, on October 26, 1926, a State Motor Vehicle Department check at the Four Corners counted 2,644 trolleys, 4,098 buses, 2657 taxis, 3474 commercial vehicles, and 23,571 automobiles. Traffic in Newark was so heavy that the city converted the old bed of the Morris Canal into the Newark City Subway, making Newark one of the few cities in the country to have an underground system. Essex County was the first county park system in the country.\nNew skyscrapers were being built every year, the two tallest in the city being the Art Deco National Newark Building and the Lefcourt-Newark Building. In 1948, just after World War II, Newark hit its peak population of just under 450,000. The population also grew as immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe settled there. Newark was the center of distinctive neighborhoods, including a large Eastern European Jewish community concentrated along Prince Street. In 1959 German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe designed an apartment complex across from Branchbrook Park.\n\nProblems existed underneath the industrial hum. In 1930, a city commissioner told the Optimists, a local booster club:\n\nWhile many observers attributed Newark's decline to post-World War II phenomena, others point to an earlier decline in the city budget as an indicator of problems. It fell from $58 million in 1938 to only $45 million in 1944. This was a slow recovery from the Great Depression. The buildup to World War II was causing an increase in the nation's economy. The city increased its tax rate from $4.61 to $5.30.\n\nSome attribute Newark's downfall to its propensity for building large housing projects. Newark's housing had long been a matter of concern, as much of it was older. A 1944 city-commissioned study showed that 31 percent of all Newark dwelling units were below standards of health, and only 17 percent of Newark's units were owner-occupied. Vast sections of Newark consisted of wooden tenements, and at least 5,000 units failed to meet thresholds of being a decent place to live. Bad housing was the cause of demands that government intervene in the housing market to improve conditions.\n\nHistorian Kenneth T. Jackson and others theorized that Newark, with a poor center surrounded by middle-class outlying areas, only did well when it was able to annex middle-class suburbs. When municipal annexation broke down, urban problems were exacerbated as the middle-class ring became divorced from the poor center. In 1900, Newark's mayor had confidently speculated, \"East Orange, Vailsburg, Harrison, Kearny, and Belleville would be desirable acquisitions. By an exercise of discretion we can enlarge the city from decade to decade without unnecessarily taxing the property within our limits, which has already paid the cost of public improvements.\" Only Vailsburg would ever be added.\n\nAlthough numerous problems predated World War II, Newark was more hamstrung by a number of trends in the post-WWII era. The Federal Housing Administration redlined virtually all of Newark, preferring to back up mortgages in the white suburbs. This made it impossible for people to get mortgages for purchase or loans for improvements. Manufacturers set up in lower wage environments outside the city and received larger tax deductions for building new factories in outlying areas than for rehabilitating old factories in the city. The federal tax structure essentially subsidized such inequities.\n\nBilled as transportation improvements, construction of new highways: Interstate 280, the New Jersey Turnpike, and Interstate 78 harmed Newark. They directly hurt the city by dividing the fabric of neighborhoods and displacing many residents. The highways indirectly hurt the city because the new infrastructure made it easier for middle-class workers to live in the suburbs and commute into the city.\n\nDespite its problems, Newark tried to remain vital in the postwar era. The city successfully persuaded Prudential and Mutual Benefit to stay and build new offices. Rutgers University-Newark, New Jersey Institute of Technology, and Seton Hall University expanded their Newark presences, with the former building a brand-new campus on a 23-acre (9 hectare) urban renewal site. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey made Port Newark the first container port in the nation. South of the city, during the postwar era, it took over operations at Newark Liberty International Airport, now the thirteenth busiest airport in the United States.\n\nThe city made serious mistakes with public housing and urban renewal, although these were not the sole causes of Newark's tragedy. Across several administrations, the city leaders of Newark considered the federal government's offer to pay for 100% of the costs of housing projects as a blessing. The decline in industrial jobs meant that more poor people needed housing, whereas in prewar years, public housing was for working-class families. While other cities were skeptical about putting so many poor families together and were cautious in building housing projects, Newark pursued federal funds. Eventually, Newark had a higher percentage of its residents in public housing than any other American city.\n\nThe largely Italian-American First Ward was one of the hardest hit by urban renewal. A 46-acre (19 hectare) housing tract, labeled a slum because it had dense older housing, was torn down for multi-story, multi-racial Le Corbusier-style high rises, named the Christopher Columbus Homes. The tract had contained 8th Avenue, the commercial heart of the neighborhood. Fifteen small-scale blocks were combined into three \"superblocks\". The Columbus Homes, never in harmony with the rest of the neighborhood, were vacated in the 1980s. They were finally torn down in 1994.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1960, while Newark's overall population dropped from 438,000 to 408,000, it gained 65,000 non-whites. By 1966, Newark had a black majority, a faster turnover than most other northern cities had experienced. Evaluating the riots of 1967, Newark educator Nathan Wright, Jr. said, \"No typical American city has as yet experienced such a precipitous change from a white to a black majority.\" The misfortune of the Great Migration and Puerto Rican migration was that Southern blacks and Puerto Ricans were moving to Newark to be industrial workers just as the industrial jobs were decreasing sharply. Many suffered the culture shock of leaving a rural area for an urban industrial job base and environment. The latest migrants to Newark left poverty in the South to find poverty in the North.\n\nDuring the 1950s alone, Newark's white population decreased by more than 25 percent from 363,000 to 266,000. From 1960 to 1967, its white population fell further to 46,000. Although in-migration of new ethnic groups combined with white flight markedly affected the demographics of Newark, the racial composition of city workers did not change as rapidly. In addition, the political and economic power in the city remained based in the white population.\n\nIn 1967, out of a police force of 1,400, only 150 members were black, mostly in subordinate positions. Racial tensions arose because of the disproportion between residents and police demographics. Since Newark's blacks lived in neighborhoods that had been white only two decades earlier, nearly all of their apartments and stores were white-owned as well. The loss of jobs affected overall income in the city, and many owners cut back on maintenance of buildings, contributing to a cycle of deterioration in housing stock.\n\nWithout consulting any residents of the neighborhood to be affected, Mayor Addonizio offered to condemn and raze 150 acres (61 hectares) of a densely populated black neighborhood in the central ward for the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ). UMDNJ had wanted to settle in suburban Madison, NJ.\n\nOn July 12, 1967, a taxi driver named John Smith was violently injured while respectfully accepting arrest. A crowd gathered outside the police station where Smith was detained. Due to miscommunication, the crowd believed Smith had died in custody, although he had been transported to a hospital via a back entrance to the station. This sparked scuffles between African Americans and police in the Fourth Ward, although the damage toll was only $2,500.\n\nSubsequent to television news broadcasts on July 13 however, new and larger riots took place. Twenty-six people were killed; 1,500 wounded; 1,600 arrested; and $10 million in property was destroyed. More than a thousand businesses were torched or looted, including 167 groceries (most of which would never reopen). Newark's reputation suffered dramatically. It was said, \"wherever American cities are going, Newark will get there first.\"\n\nThe long and short term causes of the riots are explored in depth in the documentary film \"Revolution '67\".\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s brought continued decline. Middle class residents of all races continued to flee the city. Certain pockets of the city developed as domains of poverty and social isolation. Some say that whenever the media of New York needed to find some example of urban despair, they traveled to Newark.\n\nIn \"American Pastoral\", the 1997 novel by Newark-born author Philip Roth, the protagonist Swede Levov says:\nIn January 1975, an article in \"Harper's Magazine\" ranked the 50 largest American cities in 24 categories, ranging from park space to crime. Newark was one of the five worst in 19 out of 24 categories, and the very worst in nine. According to the article, only 70 percent of residents owned a telephone. St. Louis, the city ranked second worst, was much farther from Newark than the cities in the top five were from each other. The article concluded:\n\nNewark has had several achievements in the two and a half decades since the riots. In 1968, the New Community Corporation was founded. It has become one of the most successful community development corporations in the nation. By 1987, the NCC owned and managed 2,265 low-income housing units.\n\nNewark's downtown began to redevelop in the post-riot decades. Less than two weeks after the riots, Prudential announced plans to underwrite a $24 million office complex near Penn Station, dubbed \"Gateway.\" Today, Gateway houses thousands of white-collar workers, though few live in Newark.\n\nBefore the riots, the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey was considering building in the suburbs. The riots and Newark's undeniable desperation kept the medical school in the city. However, instead of being built on 167 acres (676,000 m²), the medical school was built on just , part of which was already city owned. Students at the medical school soon started the \"Student Family Health Clinic\" to provide free health care for the underserved population, along with other community service projects. It continues to operate today as one of the nation's oldest student-run free health clinics.\n\nIn 1970, Kenneth A. Gibson was the first African-American to be elected mayor of Newark, as well as to be elected mayor of a major northeastern city. The 1970s were a time of battles between Gibson and the shrinking white population. Gibson admitted that \"Newark may be the most decayed and financially crippled city in the nation.\" He and the city council raised taxes to try to improve services such as schools and sanitation, but they did nothing for Newark's economic base. The CEO of Ballantine's Brewery asserted that Newark's $1 million annual tax bill was the cause of the company's bankruptcy.\n\nPrior to the election of former mayor Cory Booker in 2006, Newark did not have a formal city planning department. As a result, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research concluded:\n\nThe New Jersey Performing Arts Center, which opened in the downtown area in 1997 at a cost of $180 million, was seen by many as the first step in the city's road to revival, and brought in people to Newark who otherwise might never have visited. NJPAC is known for its acoustics, and features the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra as its resident orchestra. NJPAC also presents a diverse group of visiting artists such as Itzhak Perlman, Sarah Brightman, Sting, 'N Sync, Lauryn Hill, the Vienna Boys' Choir, Yo Yo Ma, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.\n\nSince then, the city built a now demolished baseball stadium (Riverfront Stadium) for the Newark Bears, the city's former minor league team. In 2007, the Prudential Center (nicknamed, \"The Rock\") opened for the New Jersey Devils. The Passaic River waterfront is being refurbished through downtown to provide citizens with access to the river. The Newark Public Library is planning a major renovation and expansion. The Port Authority constructed a rail connection to the airport (AirTrain Newark). Numerous commercial developments have arisen in the downtown area.\n\nWhile much of the city's revitalization efforts have been focused in the downtown area, adjoining neighborhoods have in recent years begun to see some signs of development, particularly in the Central Ward. Since 2000, Newark has gained population, its first increase since the 1940s. Nevertheless, the \"Renaissance\" has been unevenly felt across the city and some districts continue to have below-average household incomes and higher-than-average rates of poverty.\n\nBy the mid-first decade of the 21st century, the rate of crime had fallen by 58% from historic highs associated with severe drug problems in the mid-1990s, though murders remained high for a city of its size. In the first two months of 2008, the murder rate dropped dramatically, with no murders recorded for 43 days.\n\nNewark's nicknames reflect the efforts to revitalize downtown. In the 1950s the term New Newark was given to the city by then-Mayor Leo Carlin to help convince major corporations to remain in Newark. In the 1960s Newark was nicknamed the Gateway City after the redeveloped Gateway Center area downtown, which shares its name with the tourism region of which Newark is a part, the Gateway Region. It has more recently been called the Renaissance City by the media and the public to gain recognition for its revitalization efforts.\n\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n"}

This is a distance of about .\n\nLake Street begins (or, rather, ends, in the case of motor traffic) at Stetson Avenue in the Illinois Center area of the Chicago Loop (middle and lower levels extend one block further east to Columbus Drive on a multi-level structure, with a pedestrian mall on the upper level) and then runs to the west as a one-way eastbound street. From the first two-way traffic segment at Canal Street, it continues to the west through the city of Chicago before heading into the western suburbs. For most of the first between Wabash Avenue and Laramie Avenue, Lake Street runs beneath the elevated Green Line CTA tracks and the Union Pacific (former Chicago and Northwestern) railroad tracks near Central Avenue.\n\nIn Stone Park, Lake Street runs concurrent with U.S. 20 at Mannheim Road. Eastbound U.S. 20 turns south with U.S. Routes 12 and 45. Westbound U.S. 20 follows Lake Street westbound to the western terminus of Lake Street for . A portion of Lake Street in Elmhurst has been replaced by the Eisenhower Expressway; at this point, U.S. 20 runs on the Eisenhower for 0.97 mi (1.56 km).

He was Soviet Ambassador to the United States for more than two decades, from 1962 to 1986.\n\nHe attracted notoriety among the American public during and after the Cuban Missile Crisis at the beginning of his ambassadorship, when he denied the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba although, unbeknownst to him until days later, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev had already sent them and the Americans already had photographs of them. Between 1968 and 1974, he was known as the Soviet end of the Kissinger–Dobrynin direct communication and negotiation link between the American presidency and the Soviet politburo.\n\nDobrynin was born in the village of Krasnaya Gorka, near Mozhaisk in the Moscow Oblast, on 16 November 1919. His father was a locksmith. He attended the Moscow Aviation Institute and after graduation went to work for the Yakovlev Design Bureau. He entered the Higher Diplomatic School in 1944 and graduated with distinction.\n\nDobrynin joined the diplomatic service of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1946. He later joined the secretariat of the ministry, working for Vyacheslav Molotov, Dmitri Shepilov, Andrei Gromyko and Valerian Zorin. He was appointed deputy secretary general at the United Nations in 1957 and returned to Moscow as head of the foreign ministry's department of the United States and Canada in 1960. Dobrynin was appointed as Soviet Ambassador to the United States in 1962, and he had been the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps since July 1979. His tenure lasted until 1986.\n\nAnatoly Dobrynin had the unique experience of serving as Soviet Ambassador to the US during the terms of six US Presidents (Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter and Reagan). The Cold War rivalry made his position one of the key elements in Soviet Union–United States relations, such that between the Soviet Ambassador to the United States (in Washington) and the United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union (in Moscow), most diplomatic business channeled through the former. Dobrynin's regular contacts with the US State Department resulted in him being granted his own parking spot in the State Department garage until 1981, when President Reagan revoked that privilege.\n\nDobrynin developed an especially close relationship with Henry Kissinger, with whom he often met and dined with up to four times a week. They had a direct line to each other's office; they exchanged gifts, shared inside jokes, and even met each other's parents.\n\nIn 1971, he was elected to the Central Committee of the Communist Party (CPSU). After his long term as Ambassador to the United States, he returned to Moscow in 1986, joining the Secretariat of the party and leading the international department of the CPSU Central Committee for two years. At the end of 1988, he retired from the Central Committee and served as an advisor to the Soviet Presidency.\n\nHe attended the December 1989 Malta Summit that formally marked the end of the Cold War. He was given the honorary rank of Russian Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary in 1992.\n\nHis book, \"In Confidence: Moscow's Ambassador to Six Cold War Presidents\", was published in 1995. (It was last reprinted in 2001 as .)\n\nDobrynin died in Moscow on 6 April 2010. In a telegram to Dobrynin's family, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev paid tribute to Dobrynin, stating:\n\n\n\n"}

The show stars Charlie Schlatter in the title role. The series debuted on August 23, 1990, on NBC and was cancelled within its first season, a few months after its debut. The show was produced by Maysh, Ltd. Productions in association with Paramount Television. Hughes was not involved in the show's production.\n\nThough based on the film, the series was not a canon continuation, rather it was set up to portray itself as being the \"real life\" situations upon which the film was loosely based. In the pilot episode, Ferris (Schlatter) refers to the film and expresses his displeasure at Matthew Broderick portraying him, even going as far as destroying a life-size cardboard cutout of Broderick with a chainsaw. However no further references to the film within the series' continuity would be made after this. As in the film, the series focused on Ferris Bueller and his high school experiences at Ocean Park High, including dealing with his best friend Cameron (Brandon Douglas), love interest Sloan (Ami Dolenz), and sister Jeannie (Jennifer Aniston).\n\nAlthough the film was set in Chicago, the series was set in Santa Monica. Like the film, Ferris is liked by everyone as the \"cool guy on campus.\" He is extremely popular, suave, quick witted and a master of ceremonies who often breaks the fourth wall. Cameron is still a depressive neurotic who, through Ferris, is able to loosen up occasionally. Sloan is portrayed slightly different in that she is not completely wrapped around Ferris' finger and has to be won over at times. Ed Rooney is the primary antagonist and always out to get Ferris but usually ends up foiled or humiliated. His secretary, Grace, is not a wise-cracking sarcastic, but a passive pushover with an unreciprocated crush on Ed. Jeannie is constantly at odds with Ferris and his being favored by all. Though she can be antagonistic, she has proven not all bad, albeit begrudgingly. In the film, Mr. and Mrs. Bueller's names are Katie and Tom but in the series they are Barbara and Bob, as well as Ferris being a junior and Jeannie being a senior as opposed to the other way around in the movie.\n\n\n\nCompared to the film, the show received mostly negative reviews from critics. It also suffered from comparisons to not only the '80s film, but also another series, \"Parker Lewis Can't Lose\"; at the time that series initially proved to be more successful when it came to ratings, lasting for three seasons. Ratings for \"Ferris\" were strong at first, but declined in later episodes. The series was cancelled due to poor viewership and low ratings after one season airing a total of thirteen episodes.\n\n"}

Its stated purpose is to defend \"the cultural, ethnic, and racial interests of Western European peoples\" and examine \"contemporary political, social, and demographic trends that impact the posterity of Western Civilization\".\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center has described it as being a \"racist journal,\" while historian Tony Taylor describes the publication as \"a far-right racially obsessed US Magazine\". Other sources have referred to it as white nationalist. David Frum and Max Blumenthal have called it pseudo-scholarly or pseudo-academic. \"The World Weekly\" describes the magazine as a \"stalwart\" of the alt-right movement in the United States.\n\nThe journal is published by the Charles Martel Society (not to be confused with France's anti-Algerian Charles Martel Group), named in honor of Charles Martel, who halted a Muslim invasion of Europe at the Battle of Tours in 732.\n\nThe editor of \"The Occidental Quarterly\" is Kevin B. MacDonald. Its publisher is William Regnery II. Editorial advisory board members include Virginia Abernethy, Richard Lynn, James C. Russell and Kevin B. MacDonald. Jared Taylor, of the \"American Renaissance\" magazine, is a past member. Samuel T. Francis was an associate editor until his death.\n\nIn response to a critical essay by \"The American Prospect\" which said that \"Sitting on the Occidental's advisory board is a who's who of the national anti-immigration movement\", Regnery defended the editorial board, stating: \"Of the thirteen individuals on its editorial board, ten hold Ph.D.s and two others are editors of their own publications. All are respected writers in their own fields.\"\n\nThey explicitly reject neoconservatism and call for a \"third school\" to emerge from paleoconservatism in the form of an ideology of Western European identity politics, and holds that the American political order of freedom and liberty is under ethnic and ideological threat. Its foreign policy positions, broadly, are anti-immigration with the exception of \"selected people of European ancestry\" and non-interventionism, including the rejection of influence from Israel and Mexico on U.S. politics.\n\n\"The Occidental Quarterly\" also runs a news-related website, \"The Occidental Observer\", launched in 2009 as an online companion to the Quarterly, as well as a book publishing company, The Occidental Press. \"The Occidental Observer\" states that its mission is to \"present original content touching on the themes of white identity, white interests, and the culture of the West.\" The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has referred to it as \"a primary voice for anti-Semitism from far-right intellectuals.\"\n\nAccording to \"Newsweek\" magazine, in 2004 the publisher Regnery announced to the magazine's subscribers his plans for whites-only dating Web site. \"Newsweek\" reported that Regnery was concerned about a declining numbers of whites in the population, and quoted him telling his subscribers that the dating site was important \"since the survival of our race depends upon our people marrying, reproducing and parenting.\" Regnery defended the whites-only matchmaking idea, insisting that it is no different from sites run for Jewish singles, such as JDate.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2034355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2034355", "title": "Agent 47", "text": "Agent 47\n\nAgent 47 (or simply 47) is the codename of the protagonist and antihero of the \"Hitman\" video game franchise developed by Danish developer IO Interactive (IOI). He appears in all games in the series, as well as comics published by Dynamite Entertainment and two live action films. He first appeared in \"\" (2000) and most recently in \"Hitman 2\" (2018).\n\n47 is a paid assassin and a clone. He gets his name from being the 47th clone created from the DNA of five different men, made to be perfect assassins who could easily maintain peak physicality and intelligence while easily being controlled by whoever they were devoted to, usually a handler. As 47, the player travels the world and executes hits on individuals while trying to be as stealthy as possible. This includes taking disguises, using aliases, and using silenced weaponry.\nThe character of Agent 47 has been well received by critics and has become a well known video game character.\n\nAccording to Jacob Andersen, lead designer of \"Hitman 2: Silent Assassin\", Agent 47 went from being \"a mean old hairy guy\" to having \"hi-tech glasses\" before getting to his current design. More inspiration came from \"comic books, Hong Kong movies\" and other similar media. According to game director Rasmus Højengaard, the idea of a clone whose future is decided by the people that created him intrigued the \"Hitman\" team. He felt that the idea of creating the \"ultimate assassin\" by cloning evolved with the character before the first game was done. The character of 47 is voiced in the video game series by David Bateson, who was also the basis for 47's appearance.\n\n47 is a genetically-enhanced clone, the culmination of decades of secret research into gene augmentation. His creation was funded by a cabal of criminal masterminds who donated their own DNA to the project. In the 1950s, five men of various nationalities served in the same unit of the French Foreign Legion. After their time with the Legion was finished, four of those men returned to their respective countries and constructed their own criminal empires. The remaining one, Dr. Otto Ort-Meyer, ran a mental institution which he used as a cover for genetic experiments. In exchange for research funding, Ort-Meyer provided his former comrades with donor organs harvested from clone bodies, significantly extending their longevity.\n\nThe men whose DNA contributed to 47's creation are often referred to within the series as the \"Five Fathers\", consisting of his creator Dr. Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer, Chinese triad boss Lee Hong, Colombian drug lord Pablo Ochoa, Austrian terrorist leader Frantz Fuchs, and Arkadij Jegorov, a Russian-Kazakh gunrunner. Ort-Meyer is a discredited German scientist living in Romania, whose radical theories were deemed insane by his peers. Ort-Meyer believed that genetic recombination and human cloning could be used to produce a perfected version of the human species, superior in strength and mind and unburdened by conscience. His ultimate goal, unbeknown to his associates, was to create an army of flawless and unquestioningly obedient supermen. When Ort-Meyer's associates became suspicious of his motives, he employed 47 to systematically eliminate each of them. When 47 discovered Ort-Meyer's plans, he killed Ort-Meyer.\n\nOrt-Meyer's research produced many failed attempts, including a clone named Mr. 17, but ultimately he managed to perfect the process enough to produce an assembly line of genetically augmented clones. 47 belonged to Ort-Meyer's fourth series of clones, possessing a 47th chromosome which, combined with DNA harvested from the world's most dangerous criminals, endowed him with levels of strength, speed, stamina, and intelligence significantly above the human norm. In \"Hitman: Blood Money\", it is explained that American interests had repeatedly attempted to replicate Ort-Meyer's success, but were largely unsuccessful. 47 is the only successful healthy clone, and nothing has yet come to parallel him; while other attempts have come close, they were plagued by problems such as albinism and extremely short lifespans of 18 months. Ort-Meyer's research was distributed among many covert cloning labs, but was insufficient; a sample of 47's bone marrow was needed to fill in the DNA gaps, making him an extremely valuable specimen.\n\nHowever, during the events of \"Hitman\" and \"Hitman 2\", it is revealed that 47 had one final brother, Subject 6, who escaped from the asylum and fled to the United States under the alias Lucas Grey. He created a domestic terror cell with the purpose of hunting down Providence, the secret society which funded and benefited from Ort-Meyer's experiments. Although 47 is initially assigned to hunt Grey, he soon remembers that he and Grey made a blood pact as children to hunt down those responsible for their creation. With his memory restored, 47 secretly aides in Grey's crusade.\n\n47's typical attire consists of a black suit, black leather gloves and shoes, white dress shirt, and a burgundy tie. As the \"Hitman\" series allows players the option of engaging in stealth-based strategy to avoid conflict, 47 has the ability to exchange his stock costume (assigned to 47 at the beginning of a level or displayed in a cut scene) with various characters in the game to avoid detection. There are a wide variety of costumes to choose from including police, military, medical, and culinary uniforms that are all made available by incapacitating or killing non-player characters and stealing their clothing.\n\nAlternative stock costumes are occasionally provided. In \"\", he is seen wearing a guerrilla camouflage in the jungle, while in \"Silent Assassin\" Agent 47 wears a protective anorak in the Japanese mountains and a blue turban in Afghanistan. At the end of , Agent 47 wears a white suit and white gloves while he is placed into a coffin during his funeral. In addition to clothing, Agent 47's distinctive choice of weaponry plays an important role in his appearance. He prefers to use a pair of silver customized AMT Hardballers, a M1911 clone, nicknamed \"Silverballers\". Following \"\", the \"Hitman\" symbol replaces the Silverballer logos that are typically printed on the side of the pistol's slide. Throughout the franchise, the Silverballers serve as Agent 47's signature weapon, along with his fiber wire black garrote, appearing in every game of the series.\n\n47 is completely bald with very pale skin and blue eyes with dark eyebrows. His International Contract Agency (ICA) file from \"\" states his height as . In \"\", his weight is given as . It is apparent that 47 grows older, evident by the added wrinkles through the course of the first four games. He significantly aged in \"Absolution\", with many wrinkles on his face, him performing certain actions slower, and other reduced abilities. This is retconned in \"HITMAN™\" as 47 appears much younger, with him looking exactly the same in the game's main sections and prologue which takes place 20 years before, when he was inducted into the ICA. A medical report on 47 in-game states that although 47 is in his 50s, his body is still in peak condition as if he is in his 20s, and he is completely immune to disease. Since players of the video game series control the character from a third person perspective, the barcode that is tattooed on the back of his head is starkly prominent, although he has his head covered by a bandage for most of \"Hitman: Absolution\" after he removes it in an attempt to disguise himself.\n\n47's barcode acts as a security key to access areas of the facility where he was created and trained. His barcode is implied to be in Code 39; according to Dr. Ort-Meyer's journal, the barcode was added to the tattoo in 1975, one year after the code was developed. Curiously, other characters in the games appear oblivious to the conspicuous tattoo; a newspaper's description of 47 in \"Hitman: Blood Money\" fails to mention the barcode as a notable characteristic. The barcode is referenced in \"Hitman: Absolution\" as the only distinguishing feature 47 has, and it is stated that while others do notice it, the description of a bald man in a suit with a barcode tattoo is simply too vague to be useful to law enforcement.\n\nFrom ages five to seven, 47 was quiet and showed little social interaction. His only display of affection was towards a runaway laboratory rabbit he adopted on August 21, 1970, displeasing Dr. Ort-Meyer. However, it died on May 2, 1972. Ort-Meyer noticed 47 crying and was surprised, as he'd never seen any of his clones do so before. Five years later, he also showed affection to a pet mouse. He cared for the mouse for about a month until it was killed by a fellow clone as a cruel prank. 47 was bullied by another clone, which was part of the 6 series, in 1977 when they were both 12 years old. After watching a kickboxing tournament held by Ort-Meyer for his friends and colleagues, 47 choked the clone to death in a toilet stall and left him face-down in the toilet. To escape the asylum, he made fiber wire out of a windowsill and broken parts of a broom, oiled the squeaky door hinges to sneak out, and stashed a bow and arrow to kill a guard dog before he jumped the gate.\n\n47 hitchhiked his way into a small Romanian town without any money. He first noticed luxury clothing stores. Later, an asylum doctor found him at a bus stop and rewarded him with a pancake breakfast. He explained to 47 that he was right to kill the series 6 clone and had done a good job of it, but should in the future only kill when instructed to do so. Between the ages of 13 and 23, he began a fairly negative relationship with the asylum staff, attributed to his chronic unease stemming from his regular medical checkups and frequent injections. On one occasion, 47 stabbed a doctor repeatedly with several needles, prompting Dr. Ort-Meyer to assign more security for him.\n\nAlong with the other clones, 47 was trained from youth to become a silent assassin. He was instructed in the use of firearms, military hardware, unarmed combat, disguises, and more classical tools of assassination like the infamous fiber wire and poison. During his training, he was noted for his exceptional marksmanship, as well as for attacking the asylum staff with homemade slingshots which were promptly confiscated. Along with learning how to use the tools of an assassin, 47 was trained to analyze and adapt to his surroundings when planning an assassination, allowing him to see multiple ways to eliminate his targets silently and efficiently. He also shot smiley faces into targets when he was bored. This is one of the only examples of 47 being exposed to mainstream pop culture, although all of the clones were sufficiently educated about the outside world via school textbooks.\n\nOn September 5, 1989, Dr. Ort-Meyer went so far as to remember 47's 25th birthday in his journal (although 47 himself did not) along with comments that 47 had become \"mature\" and stopped many of his bad habits. In 1993, he stated that 47, now 29 years old, had passed every test he could think of and had become his most skilled clone. As Ort-Meyer's friends grew weary of funding him with little results, relations between them soured. Ort-Meyer sometimes blatantly hinted that he would use the clones against them if he felt it necessary. He initiated this plan by purposely creating a gap in the asylum's security for 47 to escape. Having watched 47's every move, Ort-Meyer was very pleased with 47's performance despite the fact that 47 killed one of his security guards for a disguise, and concluded that his training was complete.\n\nAccording to 47's ICA file from the \"\" trailers, the International Contract Agency first took an interest in 47's activities in 1998 and enrolled him in 2000. The 2016 game chronicles how 47 came to join the ICA: they had been impressed by his previous work as a freelance assassin, and requested to \"test\" and audition him. 47 arrived at an ICA training facility and was greeted by fellow trainee Diana Burnwood. He passed rigorous training programs, psychological evaluations, and a thorough background check, although they found very little about his previous life. While Diana believed that 47 would be an invaluable asset to the ICA, facility training director Erich Soders was very reluctant to recruit 47 because of how little they knew about him, telling her, \"Frankly, it's as if the earth just spat him out.\" He suspected 47 of lying about coming from a Romanian asylum because 47 covered his tracks perfectly.\n\nSoders grew displeased with this lack of information on 47's background, there was nothing from 47's past that ICA could use as leverage against him, and administered the strictest possible tests on 47 in hopes of being able to reject him. Learning of this plot, Diana also chose to \"bend the rules\" and assist 47 in passing his audition. 47 was then made a full agent of ICA and Diana was assigned as his handler. With a lifetime of training and genetically augmented physical abilities, 47 swiftly rose to become ICA's best and most requested assassin. Immediately after the success of his first contract kill, he was awarded the rank of Gamma. As he has little to no memory of his background, he dedicated his life to be a skilled assassin which provided him with a lifestyle of adventure and luxury.\n\nDespite the threat, 47 continued with the ICA until the events of \"\", during which the organization is destroyed. At the end of that game, the ICA is rebuilt. The last scene depicts 47 walking into a shop, using a fake name and asking what they have to sell \"preferably in the back\", suggesting that he has resumed his career at either the ICA or a competing organized criminal organization. In \"\", it is confirmed that he is still an employee of the ICA, but his employment was put on hiatus once again. He is hunted by ICA official Benjamin Travis and his men, who labeled 47 and Diana as traitors because Diana stole Victoria, a product of his cloning project. At the end of the game, it is revealed that Travis was corrupt and acting without his superior's orders. 47 kills him, but everything turns out to be an elaborate plot by Diana in order to eliminate Travis' influence on the ICA and his clone project. 47 and Diana then resumed their career at the ICA. It is shown in \"Hitman\" (2016) that he and Diana still serve with the ICA.\n\n47's absolute highest priority is completing his contract. He will sacrifice innocents if he must, but he will kill the target no matter what, although it remains a part of his dedication to professionalism to avoid any unnecessary collateral damage. He is emotionally closed off to the suffering of others when appropriate on a contract, even if they remind him of himself at a younger age. He is very quiet and monotone to the point of being socially awkward, which is perhaps the biggest of his very few weaknesses. He generally speaks in an eloquent, non-threatening tone, rarely swearing or even raising his voice. He also has a blank and somewhat sinister facial expression, often scanning the scene with his eyes; the only other facial expression he has been known to show is pain, though he occasionally smirks in the 2007 film adaptation. 47 seems to also be an accomplished conversationalist despite the fact that he is extremely reserved, often able to fool and manipulate people with convincing lies. \"Hitman: Enemy Within\" shows that he has the capability to act far out of his normal personality to imitate people, such as a when he pretends to be a cocky womanizing biker.\n\nNevertheless, 47 can blend into the crowd and play the role of a regular person very effectively and efficiently. He is content with being alone but has a deep, if unexpressed, admiration for the few people he becomes close toespecially Diana Burnwood, Father Emilio Vittorio, Helen McAdams, Victoria, Tommy Clemenza, and Mei Ling. 47 also shows uncharacteristic sensitivity towards animals that he keeps as pets, such as his childhood rabbit and mouse during his time in the asylum, and a yellow canary in \"\" (though he is not hesitant to kill the canary in order to avoid giving his position away to authorities). He very rarely shows the same care towards human beings, though he has expressed disgust at exploiting innocent people, as mentioned during the briefing in Death Factory, when he lamented at how Travis and Blake Dexter used children as weapons.\n\nBoth \"Hitman\" novels and some portions of \"Hitman: Absolution\" show a side of 47 rarely seen. When out of his element or not on assignment, 47 occasionally shows behavior similar to ordinary people. In \"Hitman: Enemy Within\", he is shown swearing when frustrated, as well as sharing a joke with Diana. More often than not, he prefers to keep to himself. 47 is assumed to be a multi-millionaire from his contract earnings, but never stops accepting new contracts. He only spends his money on simple things like food, clothes, shelter, and job-related equipment, although he is also known to donate some of it to Vittorio and his Catholic church. He does have a particular taste for fine dining and expensive clothing, and it is implied in \"Blood Money\" and \"Absolution\" that all of his suits are professionally tailored.\n\nIt can be determined that 47 does his work as a hitman not just for money, but also in an attempt to find his purpose in life. This is further demonstrated when he did not take a suitcase containing 10 million dollars from Blake Dexter after killing him, instead letting Victoria dump the money on Dexter's body and fly off into the breeze. It is stated that he has to work as a hitman since trying to live a \"normal\" life will endanger those around him, showing he does seem capable of having concern for other human beings.\n\nEven though 47 is a relatively emotionless assassin, he shows signs of morality. In \"Hitman 2: Silent Assassin\", he is seen confessing his sins to Vittorio. When Vittorio is killed, 47 seemingly becomes so depressed from the apparent loss of his spiritual guide that he accepts a contract regarded by others as a \"suicide mission\". The novels often have him pondering the question of his own morality and values. In \"Hitman: Absolution\", 47 initially went through with his contract to kill his former handler Diana after she exposed the ICA and went into hiding, shooting her before she had the chance to explain herself. Watching her bleed to death on the ground, 47 hesitated to finish her off and demanded to know how she could betray the ICA. When Diana tells him that she needed to take the young clone Victoria away from the doctors, he agrees to keep Victoria safe after Diana's death.\n\nAs a class one type clone, 47 was genetically enhanced in order to perform physical tasks much more efficiently than an average human. He has heightened combat skills, speed, reflexes, strength, and stamina; he is apparently able to run 10 km (6.2 miles) in 36 minutes and 39 seconds, as well as possessing an effective metabolism and some form of limited healing power. This healing power is efficient enough to help him recover from a gunshot in a few hours, though he still needs medical attention in order to have the bullet removed and the pain suppressed with some painkillers as seen in \"Hitman: Contracts\". 47 has mastered the art of stealth, being able to terminate multiple enemies in the same area one at a time and sneak up on almost anybody and quietly neutralize them. 47 also has an expert understanding of using disguises in order to access unauthorized areas of a location. He is physically strong even when compared to adult males of his size and build in peak condition, being able to climb pipes, pick up/drag and dispose of bodies, snap necks, knock people unconscious with one hit, and jump from balcony to balcony with minimum effort. 47 is also a very skilled driver, judging from how well he managed to maneuver Ort-Meyer's car past a police blockade in rainy conditions in \"Hitman: Contracts\". 47's driving skill is also manifested in his ability to drive specialist motor vehicles, such as a bus and a large truck in \"Blood Money\" and \"Contracts\", respectively. 47's vehicular skills are not just limited to cars; he is seen flying helicopters and planes and driving boats numerous times throughout the series. To keep in his physical condition and also keep his skills in balance, 47 practices his combat, shooting, assassination, and stealth skills whenever he is not on an assignment.\n\nTrained extensively in armed and unarmed combat and the use of improvised weapons such as explosives, sniper rifles, automatic weapons, and bladed weapons, 47 is fully adept at surveying his environment and using it to his advantage. Highlighted in \"Hitman: Enemy Within\" and \"Hitman: Absolution\", 47 is an expert in hand-to-hand combat. From a young age, 47 was trained with his fellow clones to master kickboxing. 47 was an above average fighter, losing only to clone number 6, whom he later killed. In \"Hitman: Blood Money\", he can disarm trained and armed soldiers with ease, as well as render people unconscious with minimal effort. In \"Hitman: Absolution\", he is skilled enough to engage several armed enemies unarmed and survive. He also shows his skill in martial arts when he is able to beat the genetically altered giant Sanchez in a one-on-one fight. He is resourceful enough to maintain anonymity by avoiding leaving forensic evidence for law enforcement agencies to discover through various methods. 47 is skilled in infiltration, as seen in the trailer for \"Hitman: Absolution\" when he must enter Diana's mansion to kill her, as well as ex-filtration and evasion. On site, he can slip past guards without arousing too much suspicion. He is a perfect marksman, so skilled in shooting that the newspaper in \"Hitman: Blood Money\" called him \"legendary\".\n\n47 also has a detailed understanding of human anatomy and human nature, shown through his use of poisons and sedatives, as well as striking vital points when strangling targets silently or using hand-to-hand combat. He also knows how to best move throughout an area without catching the attention of civilians or guards. He knows exactly what parts of the human body to shoot that would be a survivable shot, a fatal shot, or even the most painful shot, which he has used to interrogate victims. He is also able to face multiple enemies unarmed and survive the encounter unharmed. Whatever the odds, 47 never panics. He always keeps his composure and clear mind to the point of being perfectly aware of all his surroundings and constantly calculates his every action, never losing focus.\n\nOver the years, 47 had gained a near mythical reputation of being the world's deadliest hitman, with most people believing that he does not actually exist. Due to his successful track record, 47 is usually given the Agency's largest, most complex, and most difficult assignments. He completes all of his assignments with unwavering accuracy, fulfilling all of his objectives and unfailingly eliminating his targets. 47's stealth and cunning are so perfect that his existence in the ICA became legendary; he is regarded by the world as an urban legend of a mysterious assassin, and very few know of his appearance. He is also given Gamma status by the ICA for his accomplishments as an assassin. The degree of 47's professionalism is such that in \"Blood Money\", the speaker states that once a client has contracted 47 to perform an assassination, he cannot be called off and will fulfil the contract no matter the difficulty or identity of the target, even if the client changes their mind, meaning that the client must be absolutely certain of their desire to have the contract fulfilled before they request 47. It also has been noted that 47 is the most expensive assassin offered by the ICA, and that his assignments have been among their most lucrative.\n\nThe location and total number of 47's numerous hideouts are unknown. They are often portrayed to be run-down buildings. He operated out of Father Vittorio's church in \"Hitman 2: Silent Assassin\". In \"Hitman: Contracts\", in which the story is predominately told through flashbacks, 47 is staying at a hotel in Paris, where he is recuperating after being shot. In \"Hitman: Blood Money\", his primary hideout seemed to be in a sewer and contained nothing more than a single ICA-issued laptop, a shooting range, an armory, and a rusty bed.\n\nIn 2012, GamesRadar+ ranked Agent 47 as 47th \"most memorable, influential, and badass\" protagonist in video games. He is regarded by GamesRadar+, \"FHM\", \"The Telegraph\", \"Play\", and G4 as one of the best assassins in video games. IGN ranked him as gaming's fourth \"most notorious\" anti-hero, while \"The Telegraph\" ranked him third on their list of top 10 video game anti-heroes. \"Complex\" ranked him as the 5th \"best assassin and hitman in video games\", noting him as the \"original contract killer\", while also praising his outfit as \"stylish\". \"Empire\" ranked him as the 21st \"greatest video game character\", stating that his design was \"striking\". WhatCulture placed him 25th on their list of the '25 Most Iconic Video Game Characters Of All Time', stating \"Who would have thought that creating an iconic character would be as simple as putting a bald guy in a suave suit (that probably cost more than your yearly salary) and slapping a barcode tattoo on the back of his cranium?\" They add that while the character may lack personality, his striking appearance combined with the enjoyable gameplay of the \"Hitman\" titles themselves justify his inclusion.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the 20th episode of the .\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Federation starship \"Voyager\" during its journey home to Earth, having been stranded tens of thousands of light-years away. The episode centers around the character Neelix, who while investigating for a report shared on his new daily broadcast to the crew, stumbles upon a traitor who is sending coded messages to the Kazon. A comic subplot involves 's attempts at getting his medical segments included in Neelix's daily broadcast.\n\nMorale Officer Neelix starts a ship-wide information broadcast aboard \"Voyager\" as an attempt to raise crew-morale. However, his initial reports are somewhat downbeat as he shares the news that helmsman Tom Paris (whose conduct has become increasingly erratic through several preceding episodes) is to leave the ship permanently to join a Talaxian convoy.\n\nIt emerges that someone on board \"Voyager\" has been sending information to an enemy-race, the Kazon. After Seska and the Kazon abduct Tom Paris from the Talaxian ship, Neelix suggests on his broadcast that it was Paris who had betrayed them all. Captain Janeway privately reveals to Neelix that Paris's insubordination, departure and joining the Kazon was all part of an act to flush out a suspected traitor on board. The Maquis members of the crew, including Commander Chakotay, had not been told as it was suspected that the traitor was from the Maquis. She asks Neelix to use his new journalistic role to investigate.\n\nNeelix eventually discovers that the real traitor is Michael Jonas, a Maquis engineer. Jonas locks down Engineering, injures Neelix, and attempts to draw \"Voyager\" into a trap laid by Kazon forces. Neelix recovers and attacks Jonas, who falls over a second-floor railing and is disintegrated by plasma leakage below. Tom Paris returns after damaging the Kazon ship and stealing a shuttle.

{"id": "2034383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2034383", "title": "Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge", "text": "Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge\n\nThe Claiborne Pell Bridge, commonly known as the Newport Bridge, is a suspension bridge operated by the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority that spans the East Passage of the Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island (northeastern United States). The bridge, part of RI 138, connects the City of Newport on Aquidneck Island and the Town of Jamestown on Conanicut Island, and is named for longtime Rhode Island U.S. senator Claiborne Pell who lived in Newport. The Pell Bridge is in turn connected to the mainland by the Jamestown Verrazzano Bridge.\n\nThe main span of the Newport Bridge is , ranking it number 87 among the longest suspension bridges in the world, and making it the longest suspension bridge in New England. The overall length of the bridge is 3,428 meters (11,247 ft). Its main towers reach 122 meters (400 ft) above the water surface, and the roadway height reaches as high as 66 meters (215 ft). It is four lanes wide, two in each direction. On a clear day, the bridge's towers are visible from the observation plaza at the Gay Head Light in Aquinnah on the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard, the upper levels of the city of Providence's tallest buildings (approximately 22 miles), and as far northwest as the parking lot of Stone Hill Marketplace in Johnston, RI (approximately 23 miles). Similarly, the skyline of Providence is visible from the bridge deck.\n\nThe Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge is a toll bridge, and the cash toll is US$4.00 for cars (as of 2015).\n\nFrom its opening in 1969 until 2009, the toll could be paid by cash or with tokens, which were purchased at the RIBTA office in Jamestown. E-ZPass was introduced as a toll payment in 2008. Shortly thereafter, the tokens were phased out as a form of toll payment. The final day that tokens were accepted on the bridge was December 31, 2009. Following that date, the only accepted forms of payment were cash or E-ZPass.\n\nRhode Island residents with a Rhode Island E-ZPass pay a discounted toll of only 83 cents once they sign up for the RIR-RI Resident Discount Plan. Early in 2012, the Authority had voted to raise tolls for passenger vehicles to $5. However, on June 15, 2012 this plan was abolished as Rhode Island lawmakers approved tolls to be added to the newly built Sakonnet River Bridge in the future. The bridge also charges a fee equal to the toll for improperly mounted E-ZPass transponders that require a toll-booth operator to manually raise the gate. Out-of-state residents pay full price, even with a Rhode Island E-ZPass, making this bridge the only toll facility in the U.S. to give a residence discount that isn't limited to the adjacent neighborhoods. The bridge was the only toll road in Rhode Island until August 19, 2013, when the Authority began collecting tolls on the new Sakonnet River Bridge. However, toll collection on that bridge ended on June 20, 2014.\n\nBicycles are not permitted on this bridge, but Rhode Island Public Transit Authority bus #64 has bike racks for weekday and Saturday travel.\n\nThe bridge was constructed from 1966 to 1969 at a cost of U.S.$54,742,000 by the Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade & Douglas company.\n\nThe bridge opened June 28, 1969 with ceremonies, celebration and fanfare.\n\nThe bridge was renamed for U.S. Senator Claiborne Pell in 1992, though it is still commonly referred to as the Newport Bridge by residents of nearby towns.\n\nThe bridge was featured on the Rhode Island state quarter in 2001.\n\nThe first time that runners were allowed over the bridge was when a group of 300 runners ran over in the early 1980s in a half-marathon for Save The Bay. In the fall of 2011, the inaugural Citizens Bank Newport Pell Bridge Run was held which marked the first time in recent history that runners were allowed to cross the bridge (which was closed to traffic).\n\nIn the spring of 2012, the Bridge Authority brought Open Road Tolling to the Pell bridge, allowing drivers with E-ZPass to pass through a special E-ZPass only toll lane at 40 mph. Violators are subject to a $10 fine, on top of the unpaid toll. The new lanes opened to traffic on June 22, in time for the America's Cup sailing race being held in Newport. Prior to the establishment of the E-ZPass system of toll collection, toll discounts were available to the general population through the use of tokens. A roll of 9 bridge crossing tokens could be purchased for $10 (plus one free crossing) bringing the effective price per crossing $1, available to anyone. Establishment of the E-ZPass system and elimination of tokens also eliminated discounts for non-residents.\n\nIn June 2019 a series of events were held to mark the 50th anniversary of the bridge. On June 28, a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held on the lawn of nearby Gurney’s Newport Resort & Marina. In attendance were Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Zechariah Chafee, son of the late Governor John Chafee, former Governor Donald Carcieri, Dallas Pell, daughter of late Senator Claiborne Pell, and Rep. David Cicilline. The ceremony included a U.S. Coast Guard flyover salute, a fireboat shooting water into the air, and two ribbon-cuttings. In addition, concerts were scheduled for Fort Adams State Park, along with cruises, fireworks, and other events.\n\nThe building of the bridge changed Conanicut Island's lifestyle and economy significantly. Before the bridge, Jamestown was a \"summer-resident town\" accessible only by ferry, in which one-third of the residents owned summer homes. After the bridge it has become a more wealthy community whose residents now commute to jobs and opportunities in neighboring towns. At the same time, the island's local commerce became more dependent on tourism by visitors from off-island.\n\n\n"}

The related term Aufwuchs (German \"surface growth\" or \"overgrowth\") refers to the collection of small animals and plants that adhere to open surfaces in aquatic environments, such as parts of rooted plants. Periphyton serves as an important food source for invertebrates, tadpoles, and some fish. It can also absorb contaminants, removing them from the water column and limiting their movement through the environment. The periphyton is also an important indicator of water quality; responses of this community to pollutants can be measured at a variety of scales representing physiological to community-level changes. Periphyton has often been used as an experimental system in, e.g., pollution-induced community tolerance studies.\n\nIn both marine and freshwater environments, algae – particularly green algae and diatoms – make up the dominant component of aufwuchs communities. Small crustaceans, rotifers, and protozoans are also commonly found in fresh water and the sea, but insect larvae, oligochaetes and tardigrades are peculiar to freshwater aufwuchs faunas.\n\nPeriphyton communities are used in aquaculture food production systems for the removal of solid and dissolved pollutants. Their performance in filtration is established and their application as aquacultural feed is being researched.\n\nA risk for periphyton stems from urbanization. Increased turbidity levels associated with urban sprawl can smother periphyton causing its detachment from the rocks on which it lives. It can be important for the clearance of harmful chemicals and reducing turbidity.\n\nPeriphyton serves as an indicator of water quality because:\n\nMany aquatic animals feed extensively on aufwuchs.

{"id": "2034398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2034398", "title": "SimIsle: Missions in the Rainforest", "text": "SimIsle: Missions in the Rainforest\n\nSimIsle: Missions in the Rainforest is a construction and management simulation game published by Maxis in 1995. Though it was not developed by Maxis, they still referred to it as a \"software toy\" instead of a \"video game\" because it remained faithful to the philosophy of the company.\n\nThe player chooses one of several dozen fictional tropical islands of various shapes and sizes to simulate. The islands have varying amounts of open plains, forests, mountains, natural resources, and native peoples. The amount of pre-developed land also varies but most of the islands are largely nondeveloped when a new simulation begins. Each scenario has objectives and win/lose conditions. Each map can be started with the scenario objectives turned on or off, and the simulation can continue in free form after successfully completing the initial task.\n\nThe game engine has a passing similarity to that of \"SimCity 2000\". For example, the island maps are projected isometrically and can be rotated in 90° intervals. However, the terrain graphics are more sophisticated than \"Sim City 2000\".\n\nIn similar Maxis titles, player actions, such as placing buildings, are completed instantaneously. \"SimIsle\" is instead played through the hiring of intermediary agents. The agents have varying skills and profiles, and take varying amounts of time to complete each project.\n\nThe agents are managed through the Agent HQ, which appears on every map. Each isle comes with a number of pre-selected agents. Others can be hired using the Agent HQ facility. Agents can be fired or trained while they are stationed at the Agent HQ. Each agent usually has two skills (such as Construction, Flora and Forestry, Local Culture, or Criminal Contacts). Some assignments require more than one skill; if a single agent doesn't have all the necessary talents, two or more agents can be used to finish the task. An agent's skill set also determines where the agent is allowed to move on the map. For example, agents with the \"Exploration\" skill are allowed to move onto jungle squares and may discover hidden objects in doing so. It's not possible to train agents in new skills, but they can be trained to increase the effectiveness of the skills they already have.\n\n\"SimIsle\" has its own currency, known as the \"EMU\". Each island has varying deposits of natural resources such as lumber, coal, gold, iron, and oil which can be gathered by building an appropriate facility (such as a mine, logging camp, or oil rig) on a tile which contains the resource. Once the facility is built, it operates more or less autonomously and will produce the specified resource at a rate determined by various factors including the richness of the deposit in that area.\n\nFood and unskilled labor are supplied by the native villages dotted across each island. Initially, the native villages have low populations and are only capable of producing enough food to support the lone settlement. Agents with the appropriate skills can be sent to the villages to train them, which increases their ability to produce food. This in turn allows the village population to increase. The additional villagers can then be used to found new villages or act as an unskilled labor pool. The surplus food produced can be used to support populations in towns and cities (which are built by the player) which can then be used to obtain skilled labor. The native population has a happiness level that can be adversely affected by environmental conditions or by drawing too many unskilled laborers. Unhappy villages will sometimes start growing narcotics, which can be exploited for profit using an agent with the Criminal Contacts skill.\n\nMost extraction facilities require unskilled labor to build them. Other facilities can then be built to produce lower-end goods that can be sold for profit, used in cities or used as part of the supply line in building higher end goods. The various facilities in this supply chain are connected by roads built automatically.\n\nAn AI manages what resources are distributed where and one of the challenges of the game is balancing supply with demand. In most cases, it is possible to simply buy equipment and goods needed to jumpstart production or build new facilities, but this is not effective in the long haul since it is expensive and must be performed manually by the player. Idle facilities that are starved because resources are not distributed to them or simply because none are available can become quite costly. Most resource deposits do not provide infinite supplies, which means most supply chains cannot function without player interaction forever nor can a single simulation indefinitely support heavy industry.\n\nVarious facilities can be created that bring tourism to the island such as airports and ferries. They act in a manner similar to other resource facilities like mines (although the \"used up\" tourists are returned, unlike mines). The next facility in the tourism supply line is tourist accommodations which can be upgraded both in size and quality and produce income. From there tourists will visit tourist attractions that can be built or discovered in the jungles by using an Agent with the exploration skill. Attractions not built by the player often have to be opened to the public explicitly and then upgraded before they become effective in drawing tourists.\n\nA \"Next Generation\" critic complimented the artwork and video sequences, but said the game is overall too similar to previous Maxis titles to be of interest to anyone but simulation fanatics. He also found the \"agents\" mechanic to be ineffective due to the frustration of having to memorize the agents' skills. He gave the game two out of five stars.\n\n"}

He is currently the quarterbacks coach for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL).\nDorsey played college football for the University of Miami, where he was a two-time Heisman Trophy finalist. He was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the seventh round of the 2003 NFL Draft, and played for the Cleveland Browns from 2006 to 2008. He was then the quarterbacks coach for the Carolina Panthers from 2013 to 2017.\n\nDorsey attended Miramonte High School in Orinda, California, and was a letterman in football and basketball. In football, he was a USA Today Honorable Mention All-USA selection. In basketball, he was a two-year letterman and as a senior, averaged 10.0 points, 8 rebounds, and 5 steals per game.\n\nWhile at the University of Miami, Dorsey was known as a consummate winner, leading the Hurricanes to the 2001 national championship and posting a record of 38–2 as the team's starting quarterback. Dorsey also effectively rewrote the school record book, setting career records for total offense (9,486 yards), passing yards (9,565), passing touchdowns (86), pass completions (668), pass attempts (1,153), victories as a starting quarterback (38), winning percentage by a starting quarterback (.974), 200-yard passing performances (31), consecutive passes without an interception (193), consecutive games with a touchdown pass (31), and touchdown passes in a game (5).\n\nIn addition, Dorsey was named the co-MVP of the 2002 Rose Bowl (in which Miami defeated the University of Nebraska to win its fifth national championship), Offensive Player of the Year twice (2001, 2002), and First-team All-Big East three times (2000, 2001, 2002). Dorsey was also a finalist for the Heisman Trophy in both 2001 and 2002 and the winner of the 2001 Maxwell Award, which is given to the national collegiate player of the year.\n\nIn 2002, Dorsey led Miami to an undefeated regular season and a national championship berth, where Miami would fall to eventual champion Ohio State. In double-overtime Dorsey and the Hurricanes were upset in their bid to win a second straight national championship. He passed for 296 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 2 interceptions. Miami finished the season 12–1, ranking second behind the Buckeyes. Dorsey finished the season with 3,369 passing yards, 28 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. He was once again a finalist for the Heisman Trophy.\n\nDorsey was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame at its 45th Annual Induction Banquet on Thursday, April 11, 2013 at Jungle Island in Miami.\n\nDespite a strong college career, Dorsey was selected in the seventh round with the 241st overall pick of the 2003 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers, due in part to concerns over Dorsey's arm strength. In his first two seasons in the NFL, he played in nine games (starting in seven), completing 171 of his 316 pass attempts, and throwing for 1,712 yards and eight touchdowns with eleven interceptions. He started the 2005 season as the third quarterback behind Tim Rattay and #1 pick Alex Smith, moving into the backup role after the trade of Rattay to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He went on to start three games for the injured Alex Smith. In a Week 11 game against the Seattle Seahawks, Dorsey led an inspired comeback and was a two-point conversion away from sending the game into overtime.\n\nIn May 2006, Dorsey was traded to the Cleveland Browns along with a 7th round pick in the 2007 NFL Draft for veteran quarterback Trent Dilfer, after having just re-signed with the 49ers. During training camp, Dorsey and Derek Anderson competed for the 2nd string position behind starter Charlie Frye. In the battle which ended in a virtual tie, Dorsey went on to serve as the third-string quarterback behind Anderson for all of the 2006 season. Dorsey was named the starter for the week 17 game against the Houston Texans but the previously injured Charlie Frye replaced him just minutes before the game. The Browns went on to lose to the Texans as Frye threw an interception and no touchdown passes.\n\nDorsey's hopes of becoming a starter for the Cleveland Browns became much more bleak after the Browns drafted quarterback Brady Quinn of the University of Notre Dame with the 22nd overall pick in the 2007 NFL Draft. Charlie Frye, Derek Anderson, Quinn, and Dorsey battled for position on the Browns' QB depth chart throughout the 2007 NFL Pre-season. On September 1, 2007, the Browns released Dorsey. After a disappointing loss to Pittsburgh in Week 1, Frye was traded to Seattle and Dorsey was re-signed by the Browns in a reserve role. Derek Anderson had a break-through season in 2007, further diminishing the chances of Dorsey receiving playing time.\n\nOn November 30, 2008, Dorsey was sent into the game against the Indianapolis Colts after Derek Anderson was injured; he completed two passes, one incomplete, the other an interception.\n\nOn December 2, Derek Anderson was put on injured reserve ending his season. Dorsey was named the starter for the remainder of the 2008 season. However, Dorsey was injured during the December 21 game that was against the Bengals. Fourth string quarterback Bruce Gradkowski started in place of Dorsey in week 17 against the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nDorsey was released by the Browns on February 9, 2009.\n\nFor a brief time, Dorsey was the quarterbacks coach for the Lakewood Ranch Mustangs high school football team in Lakewood Ranch, Florida. On April 26, 2011, he was named offensive coordinator at nearby Riverview High School (Sarasota, Florida).\n\nOn May 26, 2010, Dorsey signed with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, where he backed up former Miami Dolphins quarterback Cleo Lemon. On May 3, 2011, Dorsey announced his retirement from professional football.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers hired Dorsey as a pro scout on August 15, 2011. During the 2011 off season, Dorsey was an IMG employee who trained NFL quarterbacks Cam Newton, Christian Ponder, and Joe Webb, and wide receiver Randall Cobb. \n\nDorsey was hired as the Panthers' quarterbacks coach on January 23, 2013. In the 2015 season, Dorsey and the Panthers reached Super Bowl 50 on February 7, 2016. The Panthers fell to the Denver Broncos by a score of 24–10. On January 9, 2018, he was fired.\n\nDorsey was hired in March 26, 2018 to be the assistant director of athletics for the sports program at Florida International University effective April 2018. Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton was quoted as saying \"He'll bring a newness and spark to FIU. Not only is he a hard worker, but he has a vibrant killer instinct. He's a known proven winner over the years.\"\n\nDorsey was hired on February 2, 2019 to be the quarterbacks coach for the Buffalo Bills.\n\n"}

Gates, who served from 1945 to 1949. A tri-state meeting was to be held in Louisville with officials from Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. Aides to Gates learned that the governor of Kentucky was preparing \"Kentucky Colonel\" certificates for Gates and Senator Robert A. Taft, who was representing Ohio. The Indiana delegation decided to create an appropriate award to present in return.\n\nThe term \"sagamore\" was the term used by Algonquian-speaking American Indian tribes of the northeastern United States for the tribal chiefs. The Wabash is the \"State River\" of Indiana and major tributary of the Ohio River. Each governor since Gates has presented the certificates in his own way. Until 2006, the award was the highest honor which the Governor of Indiana bestows, a personal tribute usually given to those who rendered distinguished service to the state or to the governor.\n\nAmong those who have received Sagamores have been astronauts, presidents, ambassadors, artists, musicians, politicians and citizens who have contributed greatly to Hoosier heritage. The Sagamore award has been conferred upon both men and women. There is no official record of the total number presented, as each governor has kept his own roll; just as each has reserved the right to personally select the recipients.

{"id": "2034426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2034426", "title": "Utpal Dutt", "text": "Utpal Dutt\n\nUtpal Dutt () (29 March 1929 – 19 August 1993) was an Indian actor, director, and writer-playwright. He was primarily an actor in Bengali theatre, where he became a pioneering figure in Modern Indian theatre, when he founded the \"Little Theatre Group\" in 1949. This group enacted many English, Shakespearean and Brecht plays, in a period now known as the \"Epic theatre\" period, before it immersed itself completely in highly political and radical theatre. His plays became an apt vehicle for the expression of his Marxist ideologies, visible in socio-political plays such as \"Kallol\" (1965), \"Manusher Adhikar\", \"Louha Manob\" (1964), \"Tiner Toloar\" and \"Maha-Bidroha\". He also acted in over 100 Bengali and Hindi films in a career spanning 40 years, and remains most known for his roles in films such as Mrinal Sen’s \"Bhuvan Shome\" (1969), Satyajit Ray’s \"Agantuk\" (1991), Gautam Ghose’s \"Padma Nadir Majhi\" (1993) and Hrishikesh Mukherjee's breezy Hindi comedies such as \"Gol Maal\" (1979) and \"Rang Birangi\" (1983). He also did the role of a sculptor, Sir Digindra Narayan, in the episode \"Seemant Heera\" of Byomkesh Bakshi (TV series) on Doordarshan in 1993, shortly before his death.\n\nHe received National Film Award for Best Actor in 1970 and three Filmfare Best Comedian Awards. In 1990, the Sangeet Natak Akademi, India's National Academy of Music, Dance and Theatre, awarded him its highest award, the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship for lifetime contribution to theatre.\n\nUtpal Dutt was born on 29 March 1929 in Barisal. His father was Girijaranjan Dutta. He studied initially at St. Edmund's School, Shillong, and later completed his Matriculation in 1945 from St. Xavier's Collegiate School, Kolkata. In 1949, he graduated with English Literature Honours from St. Xavier's College, Calcutta, University of Calcutta.\n\nThough he was active primarily in Bengali theatre, he started his career in English theatre. As a teenager in the 1940s, he developed his passion and craft in English theatre, which resulted in the establishment of \"The Shakespeareans\" in 1947. Its first performance was a powerful production of Shakespeare's Richard III, with Dutt playing the king. This so impressed Geoffrey Kendal and Laura Kendal (parents of the actress Jennifer Kendal), who led the itinerant \"Shakespeareana Theatre Company\", that they immediately hired him, and he did two year-long tours with them across India and Pakistan, enacting Shakespeare's plays, first 1947–49 and later 1953–54; and was acclaimed for his passionate portrayal of Othello. After the Kendals left India for the first time in 1949, Utpal Dutt renamed his group the \"Little Theatre Group\" (LTG), and over the next three years, continued to perform and produce plays by Ibsen, Shaw, Tagore, Gorky and Konstantin Simonov. The group later decided to stage exclusively Bengali plays and to eventually evolve into a production company that would produce several Bengali movies. He also remained an active member of \"Gananatya Sangha\", which performed through rural areas of West Bengal.\n\nHe was also a founding member of Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA), an organization known for its leftist leaning, but left it after a couple of years, when he started his theatre group. He wrote and directed what he called \"Epic Theatre\", a term he borrowed from Bertolt Brecht, to bring about discussion and change in Bengal. His Brecht Society, formed in 1948, was presided by Satyajit Ray. He became one of the most influential personalities in the Group Theatre movement. While accepting Brecht's belief of the audience being \"co-authors\" of the theatre, he rejected orthodoxies of \"Epic theatre\" as being impractical in India. He also remained a teacher of English at the South Point School in Kolkata.\n\nSoon he would turn to his native Bengali, producing translations of several Shakespearean tragedies and the works of Russian classicists into Bengali. Starting in 1954, he wrote and directed controversial Bengali political plays, and also Maxim Gorky's \"Lower Depths\" in Bengali in 1957. In 1959, the LTG secured the lease of Minerva Theatre, Kolkata, where most notably \"Angar\" (Coal) (1959), based on the exploitation of coal-miners was showcased. For the next decade the group staged several plays here, with him as an impresario, and he still is remembered as one of the last pioneering actor-managers of Indian theatre. He also formed groups like \"Arjo Opera\" and \"Bibek Yatra Samaj\".\n\nMeanwhile, his transition to films happened while performing the role of Othello, when famous filmmaker Madhu Bose happened to be watching, and gave him the lead in his film \"Michael Madhusudan\" (1950), based on the life of the revolutionary Indian poet Michael Madhusudan Dutt. Later, he himself wrote a play on the fragmented colonial psyche of Michael Madhusudan Dutt, and the ambivalence of swaying between \"colonial\" admiration and \"anti-colonial\" revolt. He went on to act in many Bengali films, including many films by Satyajit Ray.\n\nDutt was also an extremely famous comic actor in Hindi cinema, though he acted in only a handful of Hindi films. He acted in comedy movies, the most notable ones being \"Guddi\", \"Gol Maal\", \"Naram Garam\", \"Rang Birangi\" and \"Shaukeen\". He received Filmfare Best Comedian Award for \"Golmaal\", \"Naram Garam\" and \"Rang Birangi\". In Bengali cinema, he appeared in \"Bhuvan Shome\", (for which he was awarded the National Film Award for Best Actor), \"Ek Adhuri Kahani\" and \"Chorus\", all by Mrinal Sen; \"Agantuk\", \"Jana Aranya\", \"Joi Baba Felunath\" and \"Hirak Rajar Deshe\", by Satyajit Ray; \"Paar\" and \"Padma Nadir Majhi\", by Gautam Ghose; \"Bombay Talkie\", \"The Guru\", and \"Shakespeare Wallah\", by James Ivory; \"Jukti Takko Aar Gappo\", by Ritwik Ghatak; \"Guddi\", \"Gol Maal\" and \"Kotwal Saab\" by Hrishikesh Mukherjee; \"Shaukeen\", \"Priyatama\" and \"Hamari Bahu Alka\" directed by Basu Chatterjee and \"Amanush\", \"Anand Ashram\" and \"Barsaat Ki Ek Raat\" by Shakti Samanta.\n\nUtpal Dutt also played the main villain characters in some of the major successful Amitabh Bachchan starrers such as The Great Gambler, Inquilaab (film) and the bilingual Hindi/Bangla movie Barsaat Ki Ek Raat. In fact, Utpal Dutt was the Hero (main lead) in Amitabh Bachchan's maiden venture Saat Hindustani.\n\nHe balanced successful parallel careers as an extremely serious theatre playwright and director in Bengal alongside doing hilariously comic roles in Hindi cinema. He is the greatest dramatist in progressive Bengali theatre of the 20th century.\nDutt was also a lifelong Marxist and an active supporter of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), and his leftist \"Revolutionary Theatre\" was a phenomenon in the contemporary Bengali theatre. He staged many street dramas in favour of the Communist Party. He was jailed by the Congress government in West Bengal in 1965 and detained for several months, as the then state government feared that the subversive message of his play \"Kallol\" (Sound of the Waves), (based on the Royal Indian Navy Mutiny of 1946, which ran packed shows at Calcutta's Minerva Theatre), might provoke anti-government protests in West Bengal. The play turned out to be his longest-running play at the Minerva. \"Manusher Adhikare\" (Of People's Rights) in 1968, staged as a documentary drama, was a new genre in Bengali theatre before, though it turned out to be his last production of the group at the Minerva, as they soon left the theatre. Thereafter, the group was given the name the \"People's Little Theatre\"; as it took on yet another new direction, his work came closer to the people, and this phase played an important role in popularizing Indian street theatre, as he started performing at street-corners or \"poster\" plays, in open spaces, without any aid or embellishment, before enormous crowds. The year also marked his transition into \"Jatra\" or \"Yatra Pala\", a Bengali folk drama form, performed largely across rural West Bengal. He started writing Jatra scripts, produced and acted in them, even formed his own Jatra troupe. His jatra political dramas were often produced on open-air stages and symbolized his commitment to communist ideology, and today form his lasting legacy.\n\nThrough the 1970s three of his plays; \"Barricade\", \"Dusswapner Nagari\" (City of Nightmares) and \"Ebaar Rajar Pala\" (Now it is the King's turn), drew crowds despite being officially banned.\n\nHe wrote \"Louha Manab\" (The Iron Man), in 1964 while still in jail, based on a real trial against a pro-Stalin, ex-Politburo member by supporters of Nikita Khrushchev in Moscow of 1963. It was first staged at Alipore Jail in 1965, by the People’s Little Theatre. His stay in jail unleashed a new period of rebellious and politically charged plays, including \"Tiner Toloar\" (The Tin Sword), partially based on \"Pygmalion\", \"Dushapner Nagari\" (Nightmare City), \"Manusher Odhikare\" (Rights Of Man), based on the Scottsboro Boys case, protests against the racial discrimination and injustice of the Scottsborough trial of 1931, \"Surya-Shikar\" (Hunting the Sun) (1978), \"Maha-Bidroha\" (The Great Rebellion) (1989), and \"Laal Durgo\" (Red Fort) (1990) about the demise of Communism, set in a fictitious East European country, and \"Janatar Aphim\" (Opiate of the People), (1990) lamented on Indian political parties exploiting religion for gain. In all, he wrote twenty-two full-length plays, fifteen poster plays, nineteen Jatra scripts, acted in thousands of shows, and directed more than sixty productions, apart from writing serious studies of Shakespeare, Girish Ghosh, Stanislavsky, Brecht, and revolutionary theatre, and translating Shakespeare and Brecht.\n\nHe also directed a number of films such as \"Megh\" (1961), a psychological thriller, \"Ghoom Bhangar Gaan\" (1965), \"Jhar\" (Storm) (1979), based on the Young Bengal movement, \"Baisakhi Megh\" (1981), \"Maa\" (1983) and \"Inquilab Ke Baad\" (1984).\n\nForty years after the staging of the classic play \"Kallol\" which entails the story of the mutiny of Indian sailors against the British on the Arabian Sea, for which he was even imprisoned, was revived in 2005, as \"Gangabokshe Kallol\", part of the state-funded \"Utpal Dutt Natyotsav\" (Utpal Dutt Theatre Festival), on an off-shore stage, by the Hooghly River in Kolkata.\n\n\"The Last Lear\", the 2007 English film based on his play \"Aajker Shahjahan\", on an eccentric Shakespearean actor, and directed for the screen by Rituparno Ghosh, later won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in English.\n\nIn 1960, Dutt married theatre and film actress Shobha Sen. Their only daughter, \"Bishnupriya Dutt\" is a professor of 'Theatre & Performance studies' at the 'School of Arts & Aesthetics' at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.\n\nOn 19 August 1993, Dutt died due to a heart attack right after he returned home from the S.S.K.M hospital, Calcutta, West Bengal where he had undergone dialysis.\n\n\n\nThis is an incomplete filmography of Utpal Dutt.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the fourth film adaptation of the story, which began as a 1908 novel \"The Circular Staircase\" by Mary Roberts Rinehart, which she later adapted (with Avery Hopwood) into the 1920 play \"The Bat\". The first film version of the play was the 1926 American silent film \"The Bat\". The film version was adapted by playwright Crane Wilbur, who also directed.\n\n\"The Bat\" was distributed in 1959 on a double bill with the British Hammer film \"The Mummy\". Now in the public domain, \"The Bat\" is available for online download.\n\nCornelia Van Gorder (Agnes Moorehead) is a mystery author who rents a summer home in a small town from local bank president John Fleming (Harvey Stephens). Over $1 million in negotiable securities is discovered missing from the bank while Fleming is on a hunting trip with his physician, Dr. Malcolm Wells (Vincent Price). In a cabin in the woods, Fleming confesses to Wells that he stole the securities. He offers to split the money with Wells in return for help faking his own death and threatens to kill him if he doesn't agree to help.

When Wells leaves to answer Van Gorder's call, Anderson breaks into the laboratory and searches it. Wells checks Lizzie's wound and catches the bat that bit her. Anderson arrives shortly after and says an officer will watch the house for the rest of the night.\n\nVan Gorder is visited by Wells, Dale Bailey (Elaine Edwards), and Judy Hollander (Darla Hood). Dale's husband, Victor Bailey (Mike Steele), is a clerk at the bank and a suspect in the theft of the securities; Judy works at the bank and is a witness in his defense. While Anderson is visiting Mark Fleming (John Bryant), the nephew and heir of John Fleming, Van Gorder has Dale call him about blueprints that may show a hiding place in the house. He promises to help her look for them that evening. While Van Gorder, Judy, and Dale are having dinner, Mark sneaks into the house to look for the blueprints on his own. The Bat kills him and takes the blueprints. Anderson and Wells (who is the local coroner) arrive to investigate the murder. Anderson questions the women and Van Gorder's new butler, Warner (John Sutton). Anderson tells the women to lock themselves into their rooms for the rest of the night; he will stay to watch for the Bat.\n\nAfter the women go to bed, Anderson goes into the woods behind the house with a flashlight; Warner follows him. Soon after, the Bat enters the house again. He cuts the phone line and goes to the third floor, where he begins chiseling a hole one of the walls. Hearing the noise from his chiseling, Dale and Judy go to investigate. The Bat kills Judy and flees the house. Anderson returns, saying he saw a man in the woods. He accuses Warner, whom he recognizes as a suspect for a robbery in Chicago. Warner says he was acquitted. Wells comes to the house, saying he had an accident in his car nearby; Anderson casts suspicion on him as well.\n\nVan Gorder investigates the room the Bat was in, and realizes there is a secret room behind the wall where he was chiseling. She accidentally traps herself in the room, but is freed by Detective Davenport (Robert Williams), the officer assigned to watch the house that evening. Meanwhile, the Bat kills Wells in his laboratory and leaves a fake suicide note to frame Wells as the Bat. The Bat returns to Van Gorder's house, where he sets the garage on fire to draw the occupants outside. Van Gorder sees through this ruse; she has Dale, Lizzie, and Davenport hide and wait for the Bat. When confronted, the Bat shoots and wounds (but not fatally) Davenport and is about to kill the others, when Warner returns and shoots him. Warner unmasks the Bat, who is revealed to be Lieutenant Anderson.\n\n\nCast notes\n\nRKO Pictures bought the rights to remake \"The Bat\" from Mary Pickford, who produced the original 1926 film adaptation for United Artists, the studio she founded in 1919 with Douglas Fairbanks, Charles Chaplin and D. W. Griffith.\n\n\"The Bat\" was released as a double feature with the Hammer horror film \"The Mummy\".\n\nAccording to Turner Classic Movies, in an era of films featuring \"rampaging aliens and sinister ghouls\", \"The Bat\"'s period piece approach was not a crowd pleaser, although its reputation has improved over time.\n\nFilm critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film 2 1/2 out of 4 stars (a rating that he used more than any other rating), calling it \"[a] faithful filming of Mary Roberts Rinehart-Avery Hopwood play\".\n\nAllmovie gave the film a mixed review, complimenting the film's screenplay, but criticized the script's mechanical nature and lack of scariness, as well as the varying quality of performances from the cast. But they also stated, \"While it's all done in a by-the-numbers manner, there's more than enough here to entertain whodunit fans\".\n\nIn a contemporary review of the film, \"The New York Times\" praised Moorehead's \"good, snappy performance\" and Crane Wilbur's direction.\n\n\n"}

It is a producer of health, hygiene and home products. The company was formed in 1999 by the merger of British company Reckitt & Colman plc and Dutch company Benckiser NV.\n\nRB's brands include the antiseptic brand Dettol, the analgesic Disprin, the sore throat medicine Strepsils, the hair removal brand Veet, the immune support supplement Airborne, the indigestion remedy Gaviscon, the baby food brand Mead Johnson, the air freshener Air Wick, Calgon, Clearasil, Cillit Bang, Durex, Lysol, Mycil and Vanish.\n\nRB is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.\n\nJohann Benckiser founded a business in Pforzheim, Germany in 1823. Its core business was derived from industrial chemicals. Ludwig Reimann, a chemist, joined the business in 1828 and married Benckiser's daughter. Benckiser died in 1851 and the business came under Reimann's ownership. Reimann opened a new chemical plant and, in 1858, moved it to Ludwigshafen. Under Reimann's descendants the business grew rapidly in the latter half of the 20th century: it acquired Coty, Inc., a North American beauty products manufacturer, in 1992. Benckiser's other products included Vanish and Cillit Bang. It went public in 1997.\n\nReckitt and Sons started in 1840 when Isaac Reckitt rented a starch mill in Hull, England. He diversified into other household products and after his death in 1862, the business passed to his three sons. In 1886, Reckitt opened its first overseas business in Australia. The firm was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1888. Harpic Lavatory Cleaners was acquired in 1932, and that same year, Dettol was launched.\n\nIn 1938 Reckitt & Sons merged with J. & J. Colman, which had been founded in 1814 when Jeremiah Colman began milling flour and mustard in Norwich, England, to become Reckitt & Colman Ltd. The company made several acquisitions, including the Airwick and Carpet Fresh brands (1985), the Boyle-Midway division of American Home Products (1990), and the Lehn & Fink division of Sterling Drug, maker of Lysol disinfectant (1994). The Lehn & Fink purchase doubled Reckitt & Colman's American business in one stroke. It acquired several brands from DowBrands in 1998.\n\nReckitt & Colman sold the Colman's food business in 1995.\n\nThe company was formed by a merger between Britain's \"Reckitt & Colman plc\" and the Dutch company \"Benckiser NV\" in December 1999. Bart Becht became CEO of the new company and has been credited for its transformation, focusing on core brands and improving efficiency in the supply chain. The new management team's strategy of \"innovation marketing\". – a combination of increased marketing spend and product innovation, focusing on consumer needs – has been linked to the company's ongoing success. For example, in 2008, the company's \"rapid succession of well publicised new product variants\" were credited for helping them \"to capture shoppers' imagination\". \"Business Week\" has also noted that \"40% of Reckitt Benckiser's $10.5 billion in 2007 revenues came from products launched within the previous three years.\"\n\nIn October 2005, RB agreed to purchase the over-the-counter drugs manufacturing business of Boots Group, Boots Healthcare International, for £1.9 billion. The three main brands acquired were Nurofen's analgesics, Strepsils sore throat lozenges, and Clearasil anti-acne treatments. In January 2008, RB acquired Adams Respiratory Therapeutics, Inc., a pharmaceutical company, for $2.3 billion; one of the major brands acquired was Mucinex. In July 2010, RB agreed to buy SSL International, the makers of Durex condoms and Scholl's footcare products, in a £2.5 billion deal.\n\nIn April 2011, Bart Becht announced he was to retire as CEO of Reckitt Benckiser and would be replaced from September 2011 by executive vice-president of Category Development, Rakesh Kapoor, who had played a key role in recent acquisitions.\n\nOn 27 August 2011, RB recalled all remaining stock of its major analgesic product, Nurofen Plus, after packs were found to contain an antipsychotic drug. It turned out that this was the work of a codeine addict who had been stealing the pills and replacing them with his anti psychotic medication.\n\nIn November 2012, RB agreed to acquire Schiff Nutrition, a Salt Lake City-based manufacturer of vitamins and nutritional supplements including Digestive Advantage, MegaRed, Airborne, and Move Free, for US$1.4 billion (£877 million). In December 2014, RB spun off its speciality pharmaceuticals business, which produces Suboxone (an opioid withdrawal medication), into a separate company named Indivior.\n\nIn 2014, Reckitt Benckiser announced it was dropping its full name in favour of the RB brand. According to Kapoor, the old name was \"a bit of a mouthful\" and the name change would make life easier.'\n\nIn February 2017, the company bid $16.7 billion for the American infant formula maker Mead Johnson. On 10 February 2017, Reckitt Benckiser announced it had agreed to buy Mead Johnson for $16.6 billion. On 27 April 2017, the Philippines' anti-trust agency, Philippine Competition Commission, gave its regulatory approval on the planned acquisition of Mead Johnson Nutrition by Reckitt Benckiser Group; based on documents it submitted to the PCC, Reckitt Benckiser Group intended to acquire Mead Johnson Nutrition for $90 per share in cash. To effect the transaction, Reckitt Benckiser incorporated a subsidiary in Delaware into which Mead Johnson Nutrition would be transferred, with Mead Johnson Nutrition being the sole surviving entity at completion. Following the acquisition of Mead Johnson, Reckitt Benckiser announced that it would split its business into two - consumer healthcare, and home and hygiene. While some expert analysts viewed this move as a precursor to a possible sale of the home division, Kapoor said that it was only to improve the performance of each of the divisions.\n\nIn July 2017, it was announced that McCormick would acquire Reckitt's food brands, including French's Mustard & Frank's RedHot, for $4.2 billion, subject to regulatory approval.\n\nIn January 2019, RB announced that Kapoor is set to retire by the end of 2019. In June 2019, the company announced Laxman Narasimhan, PepsiCo's global chief commercial officer, will assume the role of CEO in September 2019.\n\nRB is headquartered in Slough, England, and has operations in around 60 countries. Its products are sold in nearly 200 countries. RB organises the majority of its products into three main categories – health, hygiene and home – with other brands belonging to three further categories: food, pharmaceuticals and portfolio brands. The company's strategy is to have a highly focused portfolio concentrating on its 19 most profitable brands, which are responsible for 70% of net revenues.\n\nReckitt Benckiser currently produces the following products:\n\nPowerbrands\n\nOther \n\nAs of 2020, RB's directors were: Christopher Sinclair (Chairman), Laxman Narasimhan (CEO), Jeff Carr (CFO), Andrew Bonfield, Nicandro Durante, Mary Harris, Dr. Mehmood Khan, Dr. Pamela Kirby, Sara Mathew, Elane Stock, and Warren Tucker. As of 2020, members of the executive committee were: Laxman Narasimhan (CEO), Rupert Bondy (General Counsel), Jeff Carr (CFO), Kris Licht, Aditya Sehgal, Ranjay Radhakrishnan, and Harold van den Broek.\n\nFrom the company's creation in 1999 until he retired in 2011, Bart Becht was CEO. \"The Guardian\" called him \"one of the most successful businessmen of his generation\". Under him, the company focused on its core brands, and on improving efficiency in the supply chain. It also increased its marketing budget. \"BusinessWeek\" noted that \"40% of RB's $10.5 billion in 2007 revenues came from products launched within the previous three years\". Becht was Britain's highest-paid businessman, taking home more than £90 million in 2009. In April 2011, he announced that he would step down in September of that year, to be replaced by Rakesh Kapoor, who had been with the company since 1987. Reckitt Benckiser shares fell by 6.6% on the news.\n\nThe company supports Save the Children. RB has also implemented an environmental initiative called Carbon 20. The initiative, which was announced in November 2007, aimed to cut the total carbon footprint of its products—from creation to disposal by 20% by 2020. As part of the initiative the company has reduced by 70% the amount of plastic in the packaging of its \"Vanish\" cleaner. In New York in February 2009, Earthjustice filed a lawsuit against RB and others. The petition seeks to compel the companies to identify all of the ingredients used in their products. Earthjustice contacted several companies in September 2008 requesting that they comply with a 1971 law requiring them to disclose the ingredients in their products and make available any associated health or safety studies. RB and the other defendants ignored or refused the request.\n\nIn June 2006, RB launched RB Trees (then known as Trees for Change), a major forestation project designed to offset the greenhouse gases created as a by-product of its manufacturing processes. The project aims to plant 10,000,000 trees, on land used or previously cleared for cultivation, to turn this back to forest.\n\nIn 2001, Reckitt Benckiser acquired the Korean Oxy brand from Oriental Chemical Industries. Since 1996, Oxy had been using polyhexamethylene guanidine (PHMG) in a humidifier steriliser product called Oxy Ssak Ssak. In 2011 the use of PHMG was dropped when the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) published a report showing a link between the compound and lung damage and deaths. Several other companies in South Korea made humidifier sterilisers with PHMG between 2001 and 2011.\n\nAccording to a \"BBC\" report in May 2016, about 500 people, many of them women and children, are reported to have died or been injured after inhaling PHMG. According to a \"The Korea Herald\" report in April 2016, in 2015 750 disinfectant users had requested a test to determine if they had been harmed by the disinfectant and as of the date of that report, 221 had been confirmed and full results were expected to be released late in 2017. A report on \"Sina.com\" in May 2016 said that PHMG was known to have caused 70 deaths and to harmed the lungs of 177 people, with the actual total of deaths and people injured unknown.\n\nReckitt Benckiser Korea has been blamed for 103 deaths by a coalition of consumer groups in South Korea; the April 2016 \"The Korea Herald\" report said that Reckitt Benckiser Korea had been blamed for 221 deaths.\n\nSometime after the release of the KCDC report, prosecutors in South Korea opened an investigation into the companies selling the disinfectants, which increased its pace in January 2016. Reckitt Benckiser Korea submitted a toxicity report on PHMG to prosecutors in January 2016; prosecutors were also investigating allegations that the company suppressed data showing PHMG to be toxic in the report it had submitted. In April 2016 a coalition of consumer groups called for a boycott of the company.\n\nIn May 2016 Korean division chief Ataur Safdar apologised to victims and families in a press conference and offered compensation to the families of those who died to those who were injured; it was the first time the company had acknowledged that its products containing PHMG were harmful.\n\nIn 2008 the BBC's \"Newsnight\" accused Reckitt Benckiser of attempting to delay the introduction of a competitive, generic version of one of its most popular products, Gaviscon, a treatment for heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease. In his introduction, reporter Martin Shankleman said, \"Gaviscon is hailed as a power brand by its owners, Reckitt Benckiser\". He continued, \"Reckitt Benckiser likes to claim that the profits flow from their expertise in marketing. But we know that there's another way in which they've been coining it in—-by ripping-off the NHS, as a whistle-blower has told us. The \"whistle-blower\" was shown in silhouette, and his words were spoken by an actor: \"Reckitt's cheated the National Health Service. It could have saved the NHS millions of pounds. But not just the NHS, patients, doctors—they've cheated health professionals. I felt it had to be exposed\". \"Newsnight\" claimed that RB had a \"secret plan to ensure that it kept its stranglehold\" after the Gaviscon patent expired in 1999, and that \"Newsnight\" had seen the plan. The Department of Health asked \"Newsnight\" to hand its documents to the NHS counter-fraud service.\n\nThe investigation was widely reported in the British press. \"The Guardian\" quoted a leaked memo in which the product's manager explained that the company could use \"the rationale of health and safety\" to design a switched product to \"muddy the waters.\" The newspaper quoted RB as stating that the leaked memos were \"inappropriate and did not reflect Reckitt's eventual actions\".\n\n\"The Independent\" quoted Warwick Smith, director of the British Generic Manufacturers Association: \"The sort of evergreening alleged by \"Newsnight\" can cost the NHS tens of millions of pounds with no patient benefit.\" It also quoted a statement issued by the company: \"...RB is a responsible company and we have therefore instigated an immediate internal investigation and will take action. However, we do not accept much of what has been alleged.\"\n\n\"The Times\" noted that \"Although Gaviscon has been out of patent for almost ten years, no other manufacturer has developed a cheap generic version. Such a drug could have saved the NHS up to £40 million.\" It stated that the Office of Fair Trading was expected to examine whether Reckitt had acted illegally. It also printed verbatim extracts from several of the leaked memos.\n\nIn response to the \"Newsnight\" report and the reports in the press, RB issued a statement that began:\nOn 15 October 2010, RB was fined £10.2 million by the Office of Fair Trading after the company admitted anti-competitive behaviour.\n\nIn 2014 the Autorité de la concurrence in France found that RB had colluded with 12 other multinational companies (Colgate-Palmolive, Henkel, Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Sara Lee, SC Johnson and Bolton Solitaire, Laboratoires Vendôme, Gillette, L'Oreal, Beiersdorf and Vania) to fix the prices of popular personal hygiene products; the fine of around €950 million was the largest ever imposed by the agency.\n\nIn 2015, RB created controversy when it emerged that seemingly different versions of their product Nurofen marketed to treat specific pains, such as migraine, were all identical to the standard product despite costing twice as much. The product was withdrawn from sale in Australia for misleading consumers. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) took the matter to court and in December 2016, RB was fined .\n\nIn 2008 the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a decision to remove second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides from store shelves, leaving the products available for purchase only by US licensed applicators. The ruling was slated to go into effect in 2011 allowing poison companies time to adjust to the new law. EPA's decision was based on tens of thousands of reports of pet, wildlife and child poisonings that resulted annually from rat poisons in the US alone. In 2011, Reckitt Benckiser makers of d-CON products initiated a legal challenge to the EPA expected to take several years to resolve. Early in 2014, California State Department of Pesticide Regulation ruled that anticoagulant rat poison sales would be restricted beginning on 1 July 2014. RB filed suit in San Diego County Superior Court in April 2014 to block the decision.\n\nAccording to a 2016 Amnesty International report, Reckitt Benckiser is one of several consumer companies that buy palm oil from Wilmar International, the world's largest palm oil refiner. Amnesty found that Wilmar profits from child labour and forced labour and exposes workers to toxic banned chemicals.\n\n"}
{"id": "2034465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2034465", "title": "Kissing gourami", "text": "Kissing gourami\n\nKissing gouramis, also known as kissing fish or kissers (\"Helostoma temminkii\"), are medium-sized tropical freshwater fish comprising the monotypic labyrinth fish family Helostomatidae (from the Greek \"elos\" [stud, nail], \"stoma\" [mouth]). These fish originate from Thailand to Indonesia. They can be\nfood fish which are farmed in their native Southeast Asia. They are used fresh for steaming, baking, broiling, and pan frying. The kissing gourami is a popular aquarium fish.\n\nTypical of gourami, the body is deep and strongly compressed laterally. The long-based dorsal (16–18 spinous rays, 13–16 soft) and anal fins (13–15 spinous rays, 17–19 soft) mirror each other in length and frame the body. The posterior most soft rays of each of these fins are slightly elongated to create a trailing margin. The foremost rays of the jugular pelvic fins are also slightly elongated. The pectoral fins are large, rounded, and low-slung. The caudal fin is rounded to concave. The lateral line is divided in two, with the posterior portion starting below the end of the other; there are a total of 43–48 scales running the line's length.\n\nThe most distinctive feature of the kissing gourami is its mouth. Other than being terminal (forward-facing) rather than superior (upward-facing) as in other gourami families, the kissing gourami's mouth is highly protrusible as its family name suggests, the lips are lined with horny teeth. However, teeth are absent from the premaxilla, dentaries, palatine, and pharynx. The gill rakers are also well-developed and numerous. The visible scales of the body are ctenoid, whereas the scales of the top of the head are cycloid. Kissing gourami reach a maximum of in total length. There is no outward sexual dimorphism and is difficult to almost impossible to distinguish the sexes.\n\nTwo colour morphs are encountered: greens, which have lengthwise lateral stripes and opaque, dark brown fins; and pink, which have a rose to orangy pink body and silvery scales, with transparent pinkish fins. While some sources say that the green fish originate from Thailand and pink fish originate from Java, the pink form may be a man-made leucistic form.\n\nIt is important to emphasize the particularity that this species has in its mouth: it has an additional joint between its jaw and the rest of the joints, known as intramandibular joint. This type of joint is also present in other species of fish that feed on nutrients attached to the substrate. By increasing the angle of opening of the jaw, this joint allows kissing gourami to access to these nutrients. \"H. temminkii\", however, is the only species known that uses this articulation in this way.\n\nThe intramandibular joint divides the jaw into two independent elements so that it increases the degrees of freedom and the potential number of ways of getting food. This articulation, although its mechanism and anatomy are still being studied, results in an adaptation of Helodoma temminkii and its feeding.\n\nShallow, slow-moving, and thickly vegetated backwaters are the kissing gourami's natural habitat. They are midwater omnivores that primarily graze on benthic algae and aquatic plants, with insects taken from the surface. They are also filter feeders, using their many gill rakers to supplement their diet with plankton. The fish use their toothed lips to rasp algae from stones and other surfaces. This rasping action, which (to humans) looks superficially like kissing, is also used by males to challenge the dominancy of conspecifics.\n\nSpawning occurs from May to October in Thailand. Kissing gouramis are open-water egg scatterers; spawning is initiated by the female and takes place under cover of floating vegetation. The eggs, which the adults do not guard, are spherical, smooth, and buoyant. Initial development is rapid: the eggs hatch after one day, and the fry are free-swimming two days thereafter. The kissing gourami does not care for its young.\n\nThe kissing gourami present a kind of behavior associated with their characteristic jaw and mouth: two individuals approach their mouths in both mediolateral and dorsoventral planes and press for a few seconds. This type of \"kiss\" has given \"H. temminkii\" the common name of kissing gourami has been considered an intraspecific aggressive behavior also known as \"mouth fight\" due to the contraction of the jaw muscles. However, it is not completely confirmed that it is an aggressive behavior and is rather understood as a ritualized form of aggression.\n\n\"Helostoma temminkii\" can become the host to some parasitic algal species. These algae are able to survive under kissing gourami skin and look like color spots. Some hypothesis affirm that these algae communities receive some nutrients required for photosynthesis from the \"H. temminkii.\" The individuals which have these parasites in their bodies are commonly less healthy than those which have not any algae parasites.\n\n\"H. temminkii\" are able to communicate between each other due to their complex inner ear: it has a suprabranchial air-breathing chamber which gives these fishes the capacity to modulate their hearing through air bubbles in this area. Kissing gouramis are also able to emit sounds to other individuals of their own specie through the movement of their teeth.\n\n\"Helostoma temminkii\" are oviparous and dioecious and have external fertilization. Spawning occurs from May to October in Thailand, at the beginning of the rainy season. Kissing gouramis are open-water egg scatterers; spawning is initiated by the female and takes place under cover of floating vegetation. The eggs, which the adults do not guard, are spherical, smooth, and buoyant. Initial development is rapid: the eggs hatch after one day, and the fry are free-swimming two days thereafter. The kissing gourami does not care for its young. Adults migrate through the rivers to shallow lagoons or into flooded forests to spawn. A female starts mating and the male simultaneously shed the eggs and sperm to the outside. Females release an average of 1000 eggs. The eggs are spherical and small compared to other freshwater species and have a drop of oil to increase buoyancy. Fertilized eggs float to the surface and usually bind to floating vegetation, becoming larvae. Biting fish reach sexual maturity of three to five years.\n\nHelostoma teminkii is an omnivorous microphagic filtering fish, whose nutrition is based on a wide variety of food sources, such as insects, algae, larvae from other species and other microorganisms found on submerged species. The mouth, teeth, gills and especially the intramandibular joint described above make this fish a very well adapted species: it is able to find nutrients in places where other species cannot be such as algal-covered surfaces.\n\nKissing gouramis are also popular with aquarists for the fish's peculiar \"kissing\" behavior of other fish, plants, and other objects. Kissers of both sexes will often spar by meeting mouths and pushing each other through the water. Large quantities of these fish are exported to Japan, Europe, North America, Australia, and other parts of the world for just this reason. Kissing gouramis need a roomy tank to thrive; they grow rapidly, and juvenile fish will quickly outgrow smaller aquaria. Kissing gouramis are territorial; some are tolerant towards fish of similar size, but others will bully, chase, and torment, causing significant stress on tank mates. Male kissers will occasionally challenge each other; however, the \"kissing\" itself is never fatal, but the constant bullying can stress the other fish to death. They often do in fact kill other fish by sucking the mucus off their skin as food, which opens the victim fish up to infections. These fish may be useful as algae eaters to control algae growth. To prevent digging and to present enough surface area for algae growth, the substrate should consist of large-diameter gravel and stones. The aquarium's back glass should not be cleaned during regular maintenance, as the gouramis will feed on the algae grown there. Most plants will not survive the fish's grazing, so inedible plants such as Java fern, Java moss, or plastic plants are recommended.\n\nThese fish are omnivorous and need both plant and animal matter in their diets. The fish will accept vegetables such as cooked lettuce and any kind of live food. Water hardness should be between 5 and 30 dGH and pH between 6.8 and 8.5; the temperature should be between . When breeding kissing gouramis, soft water is preferred. As the fish do not build nests, lettuce leaves placed on the water surface serve as a spawning medium. The lettuce will eventually host bacteria and infusoria upon which the fish will feed. The maximum length for kissing gouramis in aquariums is between . Kissing Gourami are also a very long lived fish, a long term commitment for the fish keeper. They have been known to live in excess of 25 years (*).\n\nIn the aquarium, breeders have also produced a \"dwarf\" or \"balloon pink\" variety, which is a mutated strain of the pink gourami that are offered to hobbyists. The \"balloons\" are named so for their smaller and rounder bodies.\n\nIn captivity and in the wild the average lifespan is 5 to 7 years, but it is known that kissing gourami can live much longer.\n\n\n"}
