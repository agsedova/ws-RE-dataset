She began her adult entertainment career by posing for magazines and appearing on Playboy TV. In 1999, she made the decision to become an adult film actress and shot her first movie. She spent two years as a contract performer for the studio Sin City until May 31, 2002 when her contract expired. She gained her first AVN Award in 2001, winning \"Best Tease Performance\" for her role in VCA Pictures' \"Shayla's Web\". In 2003, she signed an exclusive contract with Wicked Pictures, after turning down offers from other companies.\n\nIn 2004, during an HIV outbreak in the industry, she stated that she had only performed with men who wore condoms, although she added that \"working without condoms in the industry is less dangerous than going home with someone who you just met randomly in a bar.\"\n\nHer performance in \"Fluff and Fold\", a romantic comedy set around a laundromat, earned her the 2005 AVN Award for Best Actress, Video and the 2005 XRCO Award for Single Performance, Actress. Along with comedian Jim Norton, Drake was chosen to co-host the 2007 AVN Awards, and stated \"this is probably the greatest thing that ever happened to me.\" At the awards, she won Best Actress, Film for her role in \"Manhunters\", for which Drake trained as a bounty hunter during pre-production. Her directorial debut came in the 2008 film \"What Girls Like\", having gained previous experience working as Brad Armstrong’s assistant director on titles such as 2007's \"Coming Home\".\n\nShe began writing screenplays during her tenure with Sin City, and has since penned films including \"Dating 101\", \"Love Always\" and \"Just Between Us\". In January 2009, she won her third Best Actress AVN Award, this time for her performance in \"Fallen\", which she has described as \"the best movie I have ever been in.\" In the film, she plays an angel trapped on Earth after the death of a woman she was sent to protect. Around the time of the awards, she suffered a stress fracture to her left foot.\n\nWith porn actress Kayden Kross, Drake co-hosted the 2009 XRCO Awards, at which her role in \"Fallen\" won the award for \"Single Performance, Actress.\" She and Sunny Leone co-hosted the F.A.M.E. Awards in July 2010. Drake was inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame in 2010 and the XRCO Hall of Fame in 2011. \"Jessica Drake's Guide to Wicked Sex: Anal Edition\" (Wicked Pictures) was named \"Specialty Release of the Year\" at the 2012 XBIZ Awards.\n\nOn October 21, 2016 Drake opened an online store selling adult videos and sexual paraphernalia.\n\nIn November 2007, Drake was among several porn actors to be guests on \"The Tyra Banks Show\" episode, \"A Day in the Life of a Porn Star.\" In 2008, Drake, Kaylani Lei, and Mikayla Mendez shot a scene for the mainstream comedy movie, \"Barry Munday\", in which they played themselves as judges in an air-guitar contest. Drake appears in the music video for the 2010 single \"Telephone\" by Lady Gaga featuring Beyoncé.\n\nIn 2014, Drake was on CNBC's list of \"The Dirty Dozen: Porn's Most Popular Stars\". Later in the year a documentary series began airing on The Movie Network and Movie Central titled \"Love, Jessica\", directed by Kai Soremekun.\n\nDrake, along with her husband actor Brad Armstrong, were interviewed for a 2014 story in \"Cosmopolitan\" magazine about costume design in adult films. In April 2014, Drake was part of discussion panel at the USC School of Cinematic Arts titled \"The Piracy of Sex.\" The event featured Drake and copyright enforcement activist Nate Glass and was hosted by David Lerner, Ph.D.\n\nDrake is affiliated with an organization that focuses on building homes and providing clean water to people in poverty-stricken and remote areas. She has performed charity work in Cambodia, Kenya and Tanzania. In 2012, Drake formed a 501(c)(3) non-profit to assist in domestic efforts. This is separate from her role in the adult industry and the \"jessica drake\" brand, since she does not want anyone to believe that she volunteers her time as part of a public relations campaign. Her charity work is done anonymously.\n\nNoting a demand for modern sex education, Drake and Wicked Pictures launched \"Jessica Drake’s Guide to Wicked Sex\", a series of erotic educational films. The first DVD in the line, \"Jessica Drake’s Guide to Wicked Sex: Fellatio\", was honored with the 2012 award for Best Educational Release by AVN Media. In 2014 Drake added a video to the series that addressed a segment that she said was under represented, plus size. In collaboration with plus-size performer Kelly Shibari, they released \"Jessica Drake’s Guide to Wicked Sex: Plus Size\". \"\"Guide to Wicked Sex\"\" was also a weekly segment on Jessica's popular Playboy Radio show, \"IN BED with jessica drake.\"\n\nDrake teaches sex education seminars and workshops around the world, including addressing a class of licensed therapists at UCLA on May 3, 2012 and speaking on a panel at CatalystCon West sexuality conference. In February 2014, Drake spoke on a panel with fellow actress Tasha Reign during the University of Chicago's \"Sex Week\" where they were featured on a panel entitled \"Jessica Drake: From Porn to Sex Ed\".\n\nAgain in February, Drake along with fellow actress Tasha Reign spoke on a panel titled \"Porn, Prostitution, and Censorship: The Politics of Empowerment\" at Moore Hall at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), along with UCLA Distinguished Lecturer Dr. Christopher Mott. The annual panel is sponsored by the Social Awareness Network for Activism through Art (SANAA) in honor of Eve Ensler’s V-Day Organization. Ensler’s \"The Vagina Monologues\" is an annual presentation on women’s issues.\n\nSeventeen days before the 2016 United States presidential election, Drake became the 11th woman to accuse Donald Trump, the 2016 Republican nominee, of sexual misconduct. On October 22, 2016, Drake and feminist civil rights attorney Gloria Allred held a news conference in which Drake accused Trump of having sexually assaulted her and two acquaintances nearly ten years prior. Drake said that she met Trump at the Wicked Pictures' (her employers') booth in a gifting suite during the \"American Century Celebrity Golf Tournament\", a charity golf tournament at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course Lake Tahoe in 2006. Drake claims that she was invited to meet with Trump, at his hotel suite and since she was \"uncomfortable going alone\" she brought along two women friends. Describing the meeting with Trump, Drake recounted that \"He grabbed each of us tightly, in a hug and kissed each one of us without asking permission.\" Drake stated that she and her friends left the suite after 30–45 minutes. Shortly thereafter, Drake received multiple phone calls from Trump or his associate, requesting that she join him in his suite for $10,000, and offering to fly her on his jet plane back to Los Angeles. She said she declined his offers. At the press conference, Drake displayed a photo of herself and Trump together on the Lake Tahoe golf course.\n\nDuring the news conference, Drake said, \"I am not looking for monetary compensation. I do not need additional fame… I understand that I may be called a liar or an opportunist but I will risk that in order to stand in solidarity with women who share similar accounts.\" In response to Drake's allegations, the Trump campaign stated that her story is \"false and ridiculous\", that \"[t]he picture is one of thousands taken out of respect for people asking to have their picture taken with Mr. Trump\" but Trump did not know Drake and \"would have no interest in ever knowing her,\" and that the story was \"just another attempt by the Clinton campaign to defame a candidate\".\n\nIn January 2018, Drake's publicist, Josh Ortiz, commented that Drake had signed a non-disclosure agreement regarding “any and every mention of Trump”. On the following day, Ortiz however retracted his words by reading a statement supplied by Drake's lawyer, which stated that Ortiz had no knowledge of any non-disclosure agreement signed by Drake.\n\nIn 2002, Drake married fellow porn actor Evan Stone; they divorced in 2004. As of 2009, she was living with Wicked director and performer Brad Armstrong, her partner for six years. She has stated that she wishes to keep her personal relationships out of the spotlight. Her brother and father were more supportive of her career choice than her mother.\n\n"}

He was elected a Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences in 1972 although his only formal education was a Civil Engineering Bachelor's degree from College of Engineering, Guindy, University of Madras. Before his death in 1988, at 57 years old, he was the only one to have received both the Homi Bhabha Fellowship 1967-69 (he spent his time at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay, and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts doing research in Groundwater modeling) and the Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowship 1975-77, two of the country's top research awards.\n\nDuring the period of Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowship he created the first comprehensive 20 volume hydrological atlas of Tamil Nadu State of India including mathematical models, details of hydraulic structures, among others. He developed also the double bounded probability density function (Kumaraswamy distribution), a probability density function suitable for physical variables that are usually bounded. This distribution is in use in electrical, civil, mechanical, and financial engineering applications. He gave the first practical hard rock well theory that won him the Gold Medal award from Indian Geohydrologists in 1974. He worked also as a design and construction engineer of two major industrial works, namely, the Tiruchirappalli Boiler Plant, and the Tuticorin Harbour Project. In addition he was involved in the hydraulic design of numerous dams, canals, and other hydraulic structures throughout South India.\nKumaraswamy considered explaining the work of the Institute of Hydraulics and Hydrology (IHH), Poondi to engineers and non-engineers an important duty and often had great success with it.\nHe was also well known among many as a rationalist and a humanist influenced much by Periyar Ramasami and was in continuous association with Periyar's rationalist organization even during the periods of emergency (1975) when many of Periyar's followers suffered, some even became afraid to associate with Periyar or his movements due to the atrocities inflicted on them at that time. He was a close friend of K. Veeramani. \n"}
{"id": "2037936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2037936", "title": "Fedora (opera)", "text": "Fedora (opera)\n\nFedora is an opera in three acts by Umberto Giordano to an Italian libretto by Arturo Colautti, based on the play \"Fédora\" by Victorien Sardou. Along with \"Andrea Chénier\" and \"Siberia\", it is one of the most notable works of Giordano.\n\nIt was first performed at the Teatro Lirico in Milan on 17 November 1898 conducted by the composer with Gemma Bellincioni creating the role of Fedora, and Enrico Caruso as her lover, Loris Ipanov.\n\nIn 1889, Umberto Giordano saw Sardou's play \"Fédora\" at the Teatro Bellini di Napoli, with Sarah Bernhardt (for whom the play was written) in the title role. He immediately asked Sardou for permission to base an opera on the play, and Sardou initially refused because, at the time, Giordano was a relatively unknown composer. Following the premiere of his 1894 \"Regina Diaz\", Giordano's publisher, Edoardo Sonzogno, asked Sardou again. However, Sardou demanded what Sozogno considered an exorbitant fee. It was only on the third attempt, and after Giordano's success with \"Andrea Chénier\" in 1896, that an agreement was reached to go ahead with the opera.\n\nIts first performance took place in Milan at the Teatro Lirico Internazionale. Gemma Bellincioni sang the role of Fedora, and Enrico Caruso was Loris Ipanov. The opera had great success on its opening night, and was soon brought to the Vienna Staatsoper by Mahler, and then to Paris where it was reportedly admired by both Massenet and Saint-Saëns.\n\n\"Fedora\" received its US premiere on 5 December 1906 at the New York Metropolitan Opera, with Caruso as Count Loris, Lina Cavalieri as Fedora, and Arturo Vigna conducting. The opera received eight performances during the Met's 1906/1907 and 1907/1908 seasons, and was revived in the 1920s when it received 25 more performances between 1923 and 1926. By the mid-20th century, however, operatic tastes had changed, and the opera became performed more sporadically.\n\nThe 1990s saw a resurgence of interest in \"Fedora\", with new productions at the Vienna Staatsoper, La Scala, New York's Metropolitan Opera, Chicago Lyric Opera, the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, the Washington National Opera and the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires. Notable singers in post-1990 productions include Mirella Freni, Renata Scotto, Agnes Baltsa, Katia Ricciarelli, and Maria Guleghina as Fedora; and Plácido Domingo, José Carreras, and José Cura as Loris. Among \"Fedora's\" most recent performances are those at the Vienna Staatsoper in 2003, La Scala in 2004, and London's Holland Park Opera in 2006.\n\n\"St. Petersburg, 1881. A winter's night in the palace of Count Vladimir Andrejevich\" \nPrincess Fedora, who is to marry the Count the following day, arrives and sings of her love for him, unaware that the dissolute Count has betrayed her with another woman. The sound of sleigh-bells is heard, and the Count is brought in mortally wounded. Doctors and a priest are summoned, and the servants are questioned. It is proposed that Count Loris Ipanov, a suspected Nihilist sympathizer, was probably the assassin. De Siriex (a diplomat), and Grech (a police inspector) plan an investigation. Fedora swears on the jeweled Byzantine cross she is wearing that Count Andrejevich's death will be avenged.\n\n\"Paris\"\n\nFedora has followed Loris Ipanov there to avenge her fiancé's death. There is a reception at Fedora's house. Boleslao Lazinski, a virtuoso pianist is playing for the party-goers. Ipanov arrives and declares his love for Fedora. She tells him that she is returning to Russia the following day. Loris is desperate because he has been exiled from Russia and cannot follow her. He confesses to Fedora that it was he who had killed Count Vladimir. Fedora asks him to return after the reception is over to tell her the whole story. When she is alone, Fedora writes a letter to the chief of the Imperial Police in Russia accusing Ipanov of Count Vladimir's murder. Loris returns and confesses that he killed Count Vladimir because he had discovered that he and his wife were lovers. The night of the homicide, Ipanov had discovered them together. Vladimir shot at Ipanov and wounded him. Ipanov returned fire, killing Vladimir. Fedora realizes that she has fallen in love with Ipanov, and that he killed not for political ends, but to defend his honor. They embrace and she convinces him to spend the night with her.\n\n\"The Bernese Oberland in Switzerland\"\n\nLoris and Fedora are now lovers and living in her villa. With them is her friend, Countess Olga Sukarev. De Siriex arrives to invite Olga on a bicycle ride. He tells Fedora that as a result of the letter she had written to the police chief, Loris's brother, Valeriano, was arrested for being part of the plot to murder Count Andrejevich and imprisoned in a fortress on the Neva river. One night the river flooded and the young man was drowned. When Loris's mother heard the news, she collapsed and died. Fedora is anguished – she has been the cause of two deaths. Loris receives a letter from a friend in Russia who tells him of the deaths of his mother and brother and that the cause was a woman living in Paris who had written a letter denouncing him to the police. Fedora confesses to Loris that she had written the letter and begs his forgiveness. When he initially refuses and curses her, Fedora swallows poison which she had hidden in the Byzantine cross she always wore around her neck. Loris begs the doctor to save her, but it is too late. Fedora dies in Loris's arms.\n\n\"Amor ti vieta\" (\"Love forbids you\") is the most famous aria from the opera and is often sung by tenors in recitals, especially as an encore piece. This short aria (approximately 1:51 minutes) is sung by Count Loris when he declares his love to Fedora in Act II. An immediate favourite with the audience, it was encored by Enrico Caruso on the opera's opening night. Caruso can be heard singing the aria, accompanied on the piano by Giordano himself, on Volume 1 of \"Enrico Caruso - The Complete Opera Recordings\" (Naxos 8.110703). This recording was made in 1902.\n\n\n"}

Steven Spielberg served as its uncredited executive producer, while Rick Baker provided the makeup and the creature designs for Harry. It is the story of a Seattle family's encounter with the cryptozoological creature Bigfoot, partially inspired by the numerous claims of sightings in the Pacific Northwest, California, and other parts of both the United States and Canada over three centuries. The film won an Oscar for Best Makeup, and inspired a follow-up TV series of the same name. In the United Kingdom, the film was originally released as Bigfoot and the Hendersons, though the television series retained the American title. The DVD and all current showings of the movie in the United Kingdom now refer to the movie by its original title.\n\nIn conjunction with the film's setting, shooting took place at several locations in the Cascade Range of Washington state near I-90 and the town of Index near US 2 as well as Seattle's Wallingford, Ballard and Beacon Hill neighborhoods and other locations in or around Seattle. The film grossed $50 million worldwide.\n\nGeorge Henderson (John Lithgow) is returning to his suburban Seattle home with his family from a camping trip in the nearby Cascade mountains when they hit something with the family Ford Country Squire. George discovers, to his horror and awe, that they have hit a Sasquatch. Thinking they have killed it, the family straps the creature to the roof of their car. A lone hunter tracking the creature discovers the Hendersons' license plate, which fell off when they hit the creature.\n\nLater that night, George goes to the garage to examine the creature and discovers it is not dead, and has escaped. He finds the creature in the kitchen, having knocked over the fridge looking for food. After a few mishaps involving the Sasquatch breaking things in the house the family realizes the creature is friendly and kind, and George has a change of heart; initially planning to make money from the creature, he decides to return him to the wild. Naming the creature \"Harry\", George tries to lure him into the station wagon, but Harry initially hurt that he may have made Ernie Henderson cry disappears into the city.\n\nSaddened, the family resume their normal lives, but sightings of Harry become more frequent as media fervor heightens. George tries to find Harry, and visits the \"North American Museum of Anthropology\" to speak with Dr. Wallace Wrightwood, an expert on Bigfoot, but is disheartened by its ramshackle state. Giving his phone number to the museum clerk (Don Ameche), George resumes his search. The hunter from the woods is Jacques LaFleur (David Suchet), a legendary hunter now a laughingstock for his obsession with Bigfoot, who tracks down the Hendersons.\n\nAt work, George's father asks him to make a poster of a violent Sasquatch to drum up gun sales, but George throws the picture away, replacing it with a proper depiction of Harry. His Father in turn alters it to make him look vicious resulting in George quitting his job at the arms shop.\n\nGeorge follows a Bigfoot sighting into the city, while the police deal with \"Bigfoot mania\" by apprehending multiple vigilante Bigfoot hunters, believing the sightings are due to a costumed prankster. After a car chase involving a garbage truck, George (albeit inadvertently) saves Harry from LaFleur, who is arrested.\n\nThe next day, George invites Dr. Wrightwood to dinner to speak about Bigfoot. The museum clerk arrives, revealing he is Wrightwood. He urges the Hendersons to give up on Bigfoot, as it has destroyed his life, but then meets Harry, restoring his enthusiasm. Bailed out of jail, LaFleur heads to the Henderson house. George and Harry escape with Dr. Wrightwood in his old truck, and LaFleur gives chase.\n\nFleeing back to the mountains, George tries to make Harry leave, going so far as to hit Harry. Confused and upset, Harry departs but the family doesn't leave when they realize LaFleur can follow his footprints. LaFleur catches up to the Hendersons and throws the family dog. Harry captures LaFleur, but George intervenes when LaFleur attempts to escape, and Harry stops George from roughing LaFleur up. Through Harry's kindness and George's faith, LaFleur changes his mind and decides that Harry deserves to live peacefully. As the family says goodbye, George thanks Harry, who gives him a hug, for all he has done for the family. George tells him to take care of himself, to which Harry replies, \"Okay\" – his first spoken word. As Harry leaves, several other Sasquatches appear and they disappear into the wilderness together, to the Hendersons’ amazement. When Dr. Wrightwood asks LaFleur what he will do next, LaFleur replies, \"I don't know. There's always Loch Ness.\" They laugh, as the Hendersons wave goodbye to Harry.\n\n\n\"Harry and the Hendersons\" opened third behind \"Beverly Hills Cop II\" and \"The Untouchables\". It went on to gross $29.8 million at the North American box office and $20.2 million internationally for a total of $50 million worldwide.\n\nRotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 45% based on reviews from 20 critics.\n\nBruce Broughton composed the film's original score, and co-wrote \"Love Lives On\" with Barry Mann (music), Cynthia Weil (lyrics) and Will Jennings (lyrics), performed by Joe Cocker over the end credits (in place of Broughton's planned end title cue); the soundtrack version of \"Love Lives On\" has a saxophone solo on a single and was later released as a single. MCA Records released a soundtrack album on record and cassette; in 2007, Intrada Records issued an expanded album, marking the music's premiere CD release, with the exceptions of the original album version of Love Lives On and Your Feet's Too Big.\n\n\"Side 1\":\n\n\"Side 2\": \n\nThe album begins with the film version of \"Love Lives On\", which has a flute solo, rather than the guitar heard on the single and on the 1987 soundtrack album.\n\n\n\nThe film was released in January 2011 on DVD entitled \"Harry and the Hendersons Special Edition\". A single-disc Blu-ray of the film was released on March 4, 2014.\n\nThe film had a television series spin-off, also called \"Harry and the Hendersons\". Kevin Peter Hall reprised Harry until his death in 1991. After that, Harry was performed by Dawan Scott in 1991-1992 and by Brian Steele in 1992–1993. Harry's vocal effects were provided by Patrick Pinney.\nLeon Redbone's version of \"Your Feet's Too Big\" was used as its theme song.\n\n"}

Gaspar de Lemos was sent back to Portugal with news of their discovery and was credited by the Viscount of Santarém as having discovered the Fernando de Noronha archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean. Gaspar de Lemos was one of many explorers of the new world.\n\nVery little is known about the life of Gaspar de Lemos. It is postulated that he was a part of the Morgada family, originally from the Kingdom of Galiza, but came to Portugal during the reign of Afonso IV (1325–1357). Upon his arrival back to Europe after participation in the exploration of the new world, the name Gaspar de Lemos disappears from the historical record, only to reappear later between 1536 and 1537 in India, under the service of Martim Afonso de Sousa. No further information has been discovered.\n\nGaspar de Lemos was the commander of a supply ship from Pedro Álvares Cabral's fleet. Cabral chose him to return to Portugal after the sighting of the new world to let King Manuel I know of its existence.

She was married to the Academy Award-winning actor Spencer Tracy. \n\nLouise Ten Broeck Treadwell's parents were Alliene Wetmore and Bright (Smith) Treadwell. Alliene Treadwell was a prominent attorney and part owner of the \"New Castle Daily News\" in New Castle, Pennsylvania. Louise's parents divorced when she was a teenager. \n\nIn 1915, Louise Treadwell enrolled at Lake Erie College in Painesville, Ohio, and graduated with honors. During the next several years, she pursued an acting career as a stage actor, primarily in stock companies. In early March 1923, Louise joined the Leonard Wood Players in White Plains, New York, which engaged her as the leading lady. There, she met actor Spencer Tracy, who had also joined the company. On September 12, 1923, Louise and Spencer were married in Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nOn June 26, 1924, Louise and Spencer's first child, John, was born. Ten months later, Louise discovered that John was hearing impaired. Early in 1926 Louise met a deaf woman at a contract bridge party who could lip read very well, encouraging Louise that John might have a normal life in spite of his deafness. She took John to a hearing specialist, who confirmed a diagnosis of nerve deafness. The doctor told Louise that even though there was no medical treatment, John could still learn how to talk, lip read, and do anything a hearing person could do.\n\nWith new hope, Louise began working with John, using material from different schools. In 1927, John spoke the word \"Mama\" for the first time. In June 1927, John was enrolled in the Wright Oral School for the deaf in New York City. At three years of age, he was the youngest child they had ever accepted.\n\nIn the summer of 1930, Spencer Tracy went to Hollywood, California, to make his first film. John and Louise also traveled to Hollywood while Spencer was filming. On the train back to New York, John was struck with infantile paralysis.\n\nIn July 1932, the Tracys' daughter Susie was born, and by March 1935, the family moved to a ranch in Encino, California, where they lived for 19 years. During the 1930s, Louise and Spencer both began playing polo and became accomplished players.\n\nThroughout their marriage, Spencer had engaged in numerous love affairs, including those with actresses Loretta Young, Joan Crawford, Myrna Loy, Ingrid Bergman, and Gene Tierney, In 1942, Spencer co-starred with actress Katharine Hepburn in the film \"Woman of the Year\". The pair famously began a long-term romantic relationship that lasted until Spencer's death in 1967. During this time, Spencer and Louise became estranged, but they never divorced. When he died, he left his entire estate, worth around $500,000, to her, their two children, and his brother.\n\nIn July 1942, Louise Tracy spoke for the first time on her experience as the mother of a deaf child at the University of Southern California at a banquet for the National Workshop of Social Workers and teachers and Parents of the Hard of Hearing. Louise spoke frequently and with increasing skill to numerous clubs and groups. It was during this time, that she and a group of mothers of deaf children decided to start a school in Los Angeles for young deaf children and their parents. The John Tracy Clinic, named after her son, was the result.\n\nDuring the first years of the John Tracy Clinic, and particularly the first few months, Louise established many of the aspects of the Clinic's philosophy. She stressed the importance of parents being involved in the education of their children at a very young age and set up a program for them. Louise firmly believed that the Clinic should offer both information and support at no charge.\n\nLouise's husband Spencer supported her work with the Clinic and was its sole financial support in the beginning. In April 1951, Spencer turned the world premiere of his new film, \"Father's Little Dividend\", at Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood, into a building fund-raiser for the Clinic's new site. Spencer's support was always strong, and over the years he personally donated more than a half a million dollars to the Clinic. His admiration for his wife was another constant. At the dedication of the new Clinic building in 1952, he said to the visiting dignitaries, staff and press:\n\n\"You honor me because I am a movie actor, a star in Hollywood terms. Well, there's nothing I've ever done that can match what Louise has done for deaf children and their parents.\"\n\nLouise Tracy was honored with many awards during the 1950s. These included the Hearing Advancement Award from the Lions Club Hearing Foundation in 1951, the Testimonial of Merit/Woman of the Year award from the La Sertoma International organization in 1953, and the Sixth Annual Award of the Save the Children Foundation in 1955.\n\nLouise was also lauded in academic circles. In quick succession, she was granted honorary degrees from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, her alma mater Lake Erie College, and MacMurray College in Jacksonville, Illinois. In 1966, Gallaudet College, the liberal arts college for the deaf in Washington, DC, honored Louise with a Doctor of Letters degree. In 1974, she was granted a Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Whitworth College in Spokane, Washington. In 1976, Louise was honored with a Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Ripon College, Spencer's alma mater, in Ripon, Wisconsin.\n\nLouise Tracy's influence in governmental circles continued in the 1960s. In 1963, Louise was appointed to the Neurological and Sensory Disease Advisory Committee of the federal Department of Housing, Education, and Welfare (HEW). In 1965, she became a member of the National Advisory Board of the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID) in Henrietta, New York. Also in 1965, she was appointed to a four-year term as a member of the National Advisory Council on Vocational Rehabilitation. In 1969, Louise became a member of the President's Task Force on the Physically Handicapped.\n\nThe John Tracy Clinic continued to expand in the 1970s. In October 1974, Louise resigned as Clinic director due to ill health. However, the honors continued to roll in for Louise, whose \"mothers' group\" had become the largest single service provider to parents of deaf children around the world. In 1974, she was presented with the 1974 Award of Honor Otolaryngology and in 1975 the Father Flanagan Award for Service to Youth from the Boys Town organization. In 1977, Louise was given the Humanitarian Award by the National Auxiliary of American Veterans AMVETS.\n\nLouise Tracy died on November 13, 1983 at the age of 86.\n"}

Steve McQueen was quite unknown when filming began, because he wouldn't get the role of Josh Randall in the TV series \"Wanted Dead or Alive\" till some months later.\n\nGeorge Fowler (Steve McQueen), a diffident former collegiate football star, is recruited for a bank robbery gang by Gino (David Clarke), the cold-hearted and unstable ex-convict brother of George's estranged flame, Ann (Molly McCarthy). George, initially insisting the limit of his involvement is strictly as get-away driver, is coerced deeper into the plot by John Eagen (Crahan Denton), the calculating plot leader. Gino also succeeds in pressuring the reluctant George (George being burdened with responsibility for the expulsion of both Ann and himself from college) to reconnect with Ann to beg for a subsistence stake to tide them over pending the anticipated robbery booty. Tensions of dislike and distrust seethe within the gang. \n\nAnn, happening to spot Gino leaving the gang's bank surveillance activity, soon extracts from George enough information to deduce that a bank robbery is about to occur. Dismayed, Ann attempts to derail the plot in hopes of saving George with a lipstick-scribbled warning on the bank's window. The warning is however detected by the 4th gang member, Willy (John's bullied but sneering minion from prison). John and Willy burst into George's and Gino's lodgings to extract the facts behind the betrayal. Gino, financially desperate to consummate the plot to avoid his own pending reincarceration, reveals Ann's identity and past relationship with George. George is forced to take the gang to Ann's apartment but is sent away, dubiously hopeful that Ann is being flown off to Chicago to silence her. Gino also abandons Ann on John's orders. John, recalling his hatred for his abusive alcoholic mother, hurls Ann to her demise off the fire escape. Unaware of this murder, George is instructed that Willy is now the wheelman, forcing the inexperienced George to a role inside the bank, but he meekly declines one final opportunity to withdraw from the plot.\n\nThe next day, the robbers commence execution of the heist, having neglected to bring a police-frequency scanner and unaware the bank relocated a switchboard from the lobby, foiling key aspects of the plan. The silent alarm is triggered and police swarm the bank exterior. John is shot down attempting escape behind a female hostage. Gino, failing to find an escape route and hemmed in by prison-like bars, commits suicide in the basement vault. After momentarily considering to battle the police Willy flees, abandoning his partners, although identified and pursued. \n\nGeorge, hobbled by a gashed leg, initiates a panicky escape behind another female hostage, but his spirit fails when the newly wed hostage's husband summons the courage to offer himself in her stead. Having realized that Ann's death was due to his own cowardly and naïve actions, he tries to surrender his pistol to a bank customer who disgustedly rejects the gun back to the sobbing and broken George. George is dragged away into a paddy wagon and the film concludes with his view of the world receding behind metal bars.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2038018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038018", "title": "Badain Jaran Desert", "text": "Badain Jaran Desert\n\nThe Badain Jaran Desert () is a desert in China which spans the provinces of Gansu, Ningxia and Inner Mongolia. It covers an area of . By size it is the third largest desert in China.\n\nThis desert is home to some of the tallest stationary dunes on Earth, with some reaching a height of more than , although most average at around . Its tallest dune is also measured, from base to peak, as the world's third tallest dune and highest stationary dune in the world.\n\nThe desert also features over 100 spring-fed lakes that lie between the dunes, some of which are fresh water while others are extremely saline. These lakes give the desert its name which is Mongolian for \"mysterious lakes\". These lakes are not completely studied and high pH lakes harbor extremely interesting animal communities. It is also crossed by one river, the Ruo Shui (\"weak water\"), which has formed an alluvial plain in the desert.\n\nMeasuring over , the Badain Jaran Desert covers a significant part of the south-central part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as well as the North part of Gansu province. Located in the Alxa Plateau at about above sea level it is listed as a subsection to the Gobi Desert. It is bound to the north by the Gobi and to the East by Mount Lang which separates it from the Ulan Buh Desert (Pinyin: wū lán bù hé shā mò Chinese: 乌兰布和沙漠)\n\nAlthough most of the dunes in the desert are not stationary, the larger ones usually ranging above are static. With these dunes only the shallow surface of the sand is constantly shifting. The middle and lower layers of the highest dunes have been compacted for more than 20,000 years causing the sand particles to harden resulting in solid layers of sand and sandstone. High moisture levels inside the dunes also contribute to maintain their fixed state. This rigid structure also allows peaks, cliffs, gullies and even caves to form as a result of water erosion and desertification.\n\nThe Badain Jaran Desert, like the Tengger Desert which lies to the east (and with which the Badain Jaran Desert is currently merging due to extensive desertification) is about one-half barren, sandy desert and one-half a mixture of solid bedrock and loose gravel. Several small lakes and oases scatter the desert around which limited vegetation is able to grow.\n\nThe Badain Jaran Desert is well known for its numerous scattered and colorful lakes. Containing more than 140 lakes they are mainly found in the southern region in the desert. These lakes can easily be found in the larger valleys between large dunes. They are believed to provide the life sustenance in the desert supporting camels, goats and horses which are herded by nomads that travel through the desert. Most lakes also support a green ring of vegetation that populate the close vicinity around the lakes.\n\nThroughout the desert some lakes change color due to large populations of algae, Brine shrimp and mineral formations at different times in year. Evaporation can also allow others to turn into a hypersaline lake forming a salt crust around the rim of the lake.\n\nAlthough their true sources are still debated it is believed that they are being maintained by underground water streams. Most arid deserts in China are surrounded by mountains that provide water sources, and this is the case with the Badain Jaran Desert. Runoff from the mountains is then collected through gravel deposits and this allows them to run through the desert, providing water sources for the scattered oases.\n\nWithin the desert there can be two main types of lakes found regarding their morphometry. The largely elongated shallow lakes mainly appear in the megadune area in the southeastern margin of the desert. Their depth often reaches less than and only measure about . The oval-shaped, deep lakes can also be found in the compound transverse megadune area. Their maximum depth reaches around and attain a maximum size of around . The lake water can be extremely saline. The shallow lakes in the southeastern region of the desert tend to have low salt concentration, averaging at less than . Other lakes can show higher salt concentrations going up to more than .\n\nThe Badain Jaran megadunes is one of the few places where a phenomenon known as the \"singing sand dunes\", \"whistling sands\" or \"booming dunes\". This rare occasion emits a sharp, loud noise that can be maintained for more than a minute. Although it is not widely understood it is believed that it is caused by an electrostatic charge that is generated as wind pulls the top layers of sand down a dune slope. This will produce a low pitched rumble that can reach over 105 decibels. The singing dunes will manifest itself by initiating an avalanche of sand down the leeward face of a large dune. This phenomenon however, does require very specific circumstances in order to generate the sound. They are silent throughout winter when the humidity is being retained in the sand. In the summer however, the booming can be generated but only on a slope of at least 30 degrees or more, on the leeward face of a dune, and the same sand on the shallow, windward side cannot generate any noise. This phenomenon is only shared by around 35 other beaches and deserts around the world.\n\nUnder the same circumstances, it is also possible to generate another acoustic phenomenon. By moving a hand gently through the dry sand of a \"booming sand dune\", this will shear the upper layer of sand off the slope and generate a burping sound emission (pulse-like, short bursts of sound).\n\nThe Badain Jaran Desert is made up of hundreds of dunes ranging from small to large. Most of the megadunes in the desert average about from the base while the rest average around . Out of all the megadunes, the Bilutu Peak (\"bì lǔ tú fēng\") is the most famous. It towers at from the base and is the tallest dune in Asia, (third tallest in the world). Unlike most of the smaller dunes the Bilutu Peak is stationary which makes it the world's tallest stationary dune.\n\nWhile the larger megadunes are stationary (with only the top layer of sand shifting), the smaller dunes are constantly shifting according to wind patterns. This makes desertification a problem in surrounding areas as the desert is constantly expanding.\n\nFor tourists willing to go more out of their way, the Badain Jaran Desert is definitely a popular tourist attraction. Based upon weather patterns, temperature and sight-seeing possibilities the best time to visit is between June and October. Since the Badain Jaran Desert falls under temperate arid and extremely arid climatic zones, it is important to be prepared when traveling through the dunes. The average annual rainfall is only between 50-60mm and is mainly centered between June to August, however the evaporation of precipitation is between 40-80 times than that of rainfall. Besides the fact that it is much colder, winter and spring have very strong winds coming mainly from the northwest getting to more than 60 days long. These winds can even get up to wind force 8. Due to these aspects of the desert climate, the popular tourist time is based upon when the climate is most comfortable. Appropriate foot wear should be worn due to the fact that sand temperatures can exceed 80 °C.\n\nThe Badain Jaran Temple (bā dān jí lín miào 巴丹吉林庙) is a well-preserved Tibetan-Buddhist temple located in the middle of the desert. It was built in 1868 at the side of a lake. Its isolation allowed it to survive untouched and safe from the Cultural Revolution. The fine state of preservation allows visitors to explore the temples attractions including statues, wood carvings, artifacts and a small white pagoda.\n\nThe temple is only accessible by land. Visitors normally reach it by renting a sand jeep at the tourist centers located along the S317 highway. Visitors can also chose to hire a driver for a daily fee. The vehicles available for tourists are 4X4 military jeeps with reinforced frames and deflated tires. These jeeps are able to drive through the desert, ascend and descend sand dunes. They remain operational for many hours. These trips by land include several stops at lakes, scenic spots and the Bilutu Peak.\n\nThe Bilutu is also a location which is commonly accessed using the sandjeeps. It is the world's highest stationary dune rising over and peaks at above sea level. The surrounding dunes only reach about . Although the biggest, it is one of several large stationary dunes within the Badain Jaran Desert. Upon reaching the top there will be a clear view of the surrounding dunes as well as several colorful lakes.\n\nAlso known as the ancient black city, it is located in the northwestern side of the desert near the Ruo Shui River and is located fairly close to the new city of Ejin. The ancient city was a Tangut city founded in 1032 which became the center of the Tangut empire. When Genghis Khan conquered the city it flourished again under Mongol rule. However, the city fell to Chinese armies in 1372 during the Ming dynasty and was left abandoned and in ruins. It has been untouched since. Although not accessible using the same jeeps, it is possible to find transport in the city of Ejin.\n\nAs early as the 5th century, rock paintings in the Yinshan Mountains were discovered by Li Daoyuan, a geologist of the North Wei Dynasty. However, it was not until 1976 when China officially started a survey of the rock paintings and from then on a large numbers of experts, scholars and tourists have visited the site. These rock paintings reflect the beliefs, aesthetic standards, world outlook and nomadic life of the Yinshan Mountain area. Since the survey over 10,000 paintings have been discovered in the area. Themes of the rock paintings are in general about hunting activities of the nomadic nationalities. Many of which depict animals including goats, sheep, argali, antelopes, elks, oxen, dogs, wild boars, rabbits, wolves, tigers and many more. Many also include scenes of hunters, weapons and methods of hunting\n\nThe rock paintings of the Yinshan Mountains were mostly drawn using two main methods, carving and painting. Most of the carvings were believed to have been chiseled with stones to dig small spots on the rocks. The chiseling was often done unevenly in depth and density. The rock paintings were drawn using a mixture of lime, animal and vegetable oils and then painted on using either the hands or brushes.\n\nThe rock carvings and paintings can be divided into four main time period. The first period was created by clan tribes during the Paleolithic Age to Mid-Bronze Age. The rock paintings of the second period were drawn from the spring and autumn Period to the western and eastern Han dynasties. The third period dates back to the Middle Ages which can be further divided into two other groups, one being painted by the Turks from the Northern Dynasty and the second being painted by the Tang Dynasty. The paintings during this period mainly depict domestic animals. Rock paintings of the fourth and final age group are works of the Mongolians after the Yuan dynasty. These consist of both chiseled and painted carvings.\n\nThe infamous Jiabiangou Labor Camp was located on the edge of the desert and from Jiuquan, Gansu. Between 1957 and 1961, the camp was used for \"re-education through labor\" to imprison intellectuals and former government officials that were declared to be \"rightist\" in the Anti-Rightist Movement of the Communist Party. Out of 3,000 prisoners, 2,500 died between 1957 and 1960, during the height of the Great Chinese Famine. The remains of the camp and the unmarked graveyards were poorly maintained and is heavily guarded by the Communist Chinese government. Relatives of the dead are only permitted during the times of Qingming. In November 2013, a memorial dedicated to the dead was quickly destroyed by local government. Many graves and human remains were also removed since then to prevent people from visiting.\n\n"}

Originating in New England in the 17th century, the simple symmetrical design was constructed of local materials to withstand the stormy, stark weather of Cape Cod. It features a central front door flanked by multi-paned windows. The space above the 1st floor was often left unfinished, with or without windows on the gable ends.\n\nThe style enjoyed a boom in popularity and adaptation to modern needs in the 1930s-1950s, particularly with Colonial Revival embellishments. It remains a feature of New England homebuilding.\n\nThe Cape Cod cottage style house originated in the wood building counties of England and was brought to America by Puritan carpenters. The harsh climate of New England tested the pioneers' ingenuity, and by lowering the house and pulling its plan into more of a square footprint, they transported the English Hall and parlor house we call the Cape Cod cottage. The style has survived and emerged as a 1- to -story house with wooden shutters and clapboard or shingle exterior. Using local materials – cedar for roofing and siding shingles, oak and pine for framing and flooring – settlers built houses locally adapted to New England's extreme winter climate. Temperatures in January and February can drop to -20F, with snow accumulations often reaching several feet. To fight the chill, they built massive central chimneys and low ceilinged rooms to conserve heat. The steep roof characteristic of New England homes minimized snow load. Finally, colonists installed shutters on the windows to hold back heavy winds.\n\nThe Reverend Timothy Dwight IV (1752–1817), president of Yale University from 1795–1817, coined the term \"Cape Cod House\" after a visit to the Cape in 1800. His observations were published posthumously in \"Travels in New England and New York\" (1821–22). The style was popularized more broadly in a slightly more elaborate Colonial Revival variant popularized in the 1930s–50s, though traditional unornamented capes remain common in New England.\n\nColonial-era Capes were most prevalent in the Northeastern United States and Atlantic Canada. They were made of wood, and covered in wide clapboard or shingles, often unpainted, which weathered grey over time. Most houses were small, usually 1,000–2,000 square feet in size. Often windows of different sizes were worked into the gable ends, with those of nine and six panes the most common.\n\nThe style has a symmetrical appearance with front door in the center of the house, and a large central chimney that could often accommodate back-to-back fireplaces. The main bedroom was on the first floor, with an often unfinished loft on the second. A typical early house had no dormers and little or no exterior ornamentation.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of early capes were timber framed, with three bays formed by four bents. A few late examples of early capes used stud framing, and plank frame was also used.\n\nThe first Cape Cod houses fall into four categories: the quarter, half, three-quarter, and full Cape. The comparatively rare quarter cape is a single bay, usually a wider \"outside\" bay that would become rooms. It has a single door and a single window on the front, but is full depth. The half Cape is two bays, with a door to one side of the house and two windows on one side of the door; the three-quarter Cape has a door with two windows on one side and a single window on the other, while the full Cape consists of a front door in the center of the home, flanked on each side by two windows. Otherwise, the three categories of early Cape Cod houses were nearly identical in layout. Inside the front door, a central staircase led to the small upper level, which consisted of two children's bedrooms. The lower floor consisted of a hall for daily living (including cooking, dining, and gathering) and the parlor, or master bedroom.\n\nSome use a different naming system, and call the full-size version a \"double cape\", but this is used more often for an extended duplex structure.\n\n\"High post\", also known as \"kneewall\", capes were originally an uncommon variant, but became more so into the 19th century, and became a feature of cape-derived vernacular architecture in the Midwest. The posts extend vertically past the first floor, increasing usable space on the second floor and simplifying joinery, at a cost of structural rigidity.\nThe kneewall was often fenestrated with small low windows.\n\nOver the years owners doubled the full Cape and added wings onto the rear or sides, typically single-storied. Dormers were added for increased space, light, and ventilation. A screened-in porch was sometimes added to one side of the home, rarely the front.\n\nColonial Revival Cape Cod houses are very similar to Colonial Cape Cod houses, but some have the chimney at one end of the living room on the side of the house. Elaborate replicas were designed for the affluent, while architects such as Royal Barry Wills modernized the Cape for middle-class families by including modern amenities that addressed demands for increased privacy and technology, including bathrooms, kitchens, and garages. Adaptations proliferated throughout suburbs which emerged after World War II, and planned communities like Levittown, New York offered Cape Cod styled tract housing, particularly to returning soldiers.\n\n-story Capes remain a popular, affordable style on the housing market.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2038064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038064", "title": "Fernão de Loronha", "text": "Fernão de Loronha\n\nFernão de Loronha ( or earlier – ), whose name is often corrupted to Fernando de Noronha or Fernando della Rogna, was a prominent 16th-century Portuguese merchant of Lisbon, of Jewish descent. He was the first charter-holder (1502–1512), the first donatary captain in Brazil and sponsor of numerous early Portuguese overseas expeditions. The islands of Fernando de Noronha off the coast of Brazil, discovered by one of his expeditions and granted to Loronha and his heirs as a fief in 1504, are named after him.\n\nFernão de Loronha was a Sephardi Jew converted to Catholicism (\"cristão-novo\"). He was the son of Martim Afonso de Loronha and the brother of another Martim Afonso de Loronha, a clerk of the Order of Christ, both ennobled and granted a Coat of Arms newly created. He married Violante Rodrigues.\n\nBy 1500, Fernão de Loronha was a well-established merchant in Lisbon, where he served as the factor of Jakob Fugger, head of the wealthy German banking family of Augsburg. In his 1504 royal letter, King Manuel I of Portugal referred to Loronha as a knight of the royal household (\"cavaleiro da nossa casa\"). His acquisition of status at a time when even wealthy and notable Jews came under persecution in Portugal suggests Loronha had unusually high connections. Even the corruption of his name from Loronha to Noronha might not be accidental, but reflect a popular assumption (which he might not have been eager to correct) that he was connected to the Noronha clan, one of the most illustrious noble families in Portugal, of royal Castilian descent (although there is no evidence Loronha had any ties, by blood or marriage, to the Noronhas).\n\nAfter the discovery of Brazil by Pedro Álvares Cabral in 1500, the Portuguese crown sent out a follow-up mapping expedition in 1501 to explore the Brazilian coast. The commander of this expedition is unknown, but it was accompanied by Amerigo Vespucci, who wrote an account of it. Some scholars believe that Fernão de Loronha may have actually been the overall captain of this expedition, although others believe it unlikely a prominent and wealthy merchant like Loronha would absent his businesses to go personally command vessels himself, that Loronha's support (if any) was probably only financial.\n\nThe mapping expedition explored much of the Brazilian eastern coast from Cape São Roque in the northeast down to the environs of Cabo Frio and named many of the locations along the way. Returning to Lisbon by September 1502, the expedition reported the discovery of an abundance of brazilwood (\"pau-brasil\") on the coast. Brazilwood was highly valued by the European cloth industry as a superb dye, producing a deep red color, but it had to be imported from India at great expense. Sensing the commercial opportunity of the new discovery, Fernando de Loronha assembled a consortium of Lisbon merchants, with himself at its head, and petitioned the crown for permission to exploit the find. In late September 1502, King Manuel of Portugal issued a charter (now lost) granting Fernão de Loronha the exclusive right to the commercial exploitation of the \"Lands of Vera Cruz\" (as Brazil was then known) for a period of three years. In return, Loronha was obliged to outfit and send six ships per year at his own expense, commit himself to discover 300 leagues of new coast per year and build a fort (\"forteza\") in the new country. Loronha would also obliged pay the crown a share of his revenues: zero in the first year, one-sixth in the second year, and one quarter in the third year. However, a different account reports Loronha was given a ten-year charter, for which he paid the crown a fixed sum of 4,000 ducats per year. One possible reconciliation is that the latter reflect not the original terms, but new terms that were negotiated upon the renewal of Loronha's charter in 1505.\n\nIn April–May 1503, Loronha's consortium outfitted a new expedition of six ships under captain Gonçalo Coelho, accompanied once again by Amerigo Vespucci, to scout the Brazilian coast and set up harvesting warehouses. On August 10, 1503, the expedition stumbled on an uninhabited island off the northeast Brazilian coast that is now called the Fernando de Noronha island. However, it went through different names at that time: Vespucci called it \"São Lourenço\", official documents called it \"São João\", while a contemporary map, the Cantino planisphere, apparently called it \"Quaresma\".\n\nThe Coelho-Vespucci expedition was instructed by Loronha to establish factories (\"feitorias\", essentially warehouses) along the coast as collection points for brazilwood harvests. It is believed three warehouses were established on this expedition - one by Vespucci at Cabo Frio (manned by 24 men, thus filling the \"forteza\" requirement), another by Coelho at Porto Seguro (\"feitoria da Santa Cruz de Cabrália\") and probably a third, also by Coelho, in Guanabara Bay (\"feitoria da Carioca\"). Around 1509 or 1511 (details uncertain), an expedition outfitted by Fernão de Loronha under Cristóvão Pires established another brazilwood factory at Baía de Todos os Santos (modern Bahia). It is believed a factory may have also been established at São Vicente around 1508 or so, although this is more speculative.\n\nOn January 14, 1504, King Manuel I of Portugal issued a royal letter granting the island of \"São João\" (Fernando de Noronha) personally to Fernão de Loronha and his descendants, thereby making Loronha the first Portuguese hereditary donatary captain of Brazil. A factory was immediately set up on the island, and quickly became the hub of Loronha's operation - brazilwood harvested directly across the water, or ferried in by small boats from the factories down the coast, were collected on the island, and dispatched on larger ships back to Portugal. By 1506, Loronha's consortium is said to have reaped a brazilwood harvest of 20,000 quintals by 1506, representing a 400-500% profit over the initial lump sum payment and ship expenses. Loronha also drummed up some business in 'novelty' pets like colorful Brazilian parrots and monkeys, cotton and occasionally, Indian slaves.\n\nLoronha's enterprise, run with only a bare minimum of staff, was not known to employ coercion. Brazilwood and other products were acquired by trade with indigenous peoples. Brazilian Indians (mostly Tupi) did all of the woodcutting independently and delivered the harvest to the warehouses, where they traded with Loronha's agents for iron goods, tools, knives, axes, mirrors, and other miscellaneous products of that kind. The slaves were not acquired in raids, but by ransoming war captives from local tribes (although this proved tricky, given the embedded tradition of cannibalism among the Tupi, local chieftains were reluctant to sell their 'sacred' prisoners.)\nLoronha's commercial charter was renewed in 1506, and then again until 1512, when the crown passed the charter to a different merchant consortium, led by Jorge Lopes Bixorda. In 1515, the Portuguese crown let Bixorda's charter expire, and finally took over the factories and the brazilwood trade itself. By this time, Spanish and French interlopers (the latter mainly outfitted by merchants from the Atlantic ports of Brittany and Normandy, connected to the cloth trade), had begun to visit the Brazilian coast with some regularity, landing brazilwood-harvesting parties and/or plundering the stores from the lightly manned Portuguese factories along the coast. As private Portuguese merchants did not have the wherewithal (nor the authority) to challenge the foreign interlopers, the losses were heavy. When the Portuguese crown took over the enterprise, it immediately set up a military coastal patrol to defend these locations. Despite losing its commercial charter, Loronha's family retained its hereditary capitaincy of Fernando de Noronha island (heirs are confirmed in documents down to 1580).\n\nIndependently of his Brazilian activities, Fernão de Loronha also participated in the outfitting of the Portuguese India Armadas of the early 1500s. The Bassas da India in the Mozambique Channel is named after one of Loronha's ships, the \"Judia\" (\"Jewess\"), which discovered the atoll by running into it in 1506. The original name \"baixas da\" Judia (\"\"Judia\" Shoals\") was corrupted into \"bassas da India\" by later error.\n\nIf anyone is responsible for the naming of Brazil and its inhabitants, it would be Fernão de Loronha. Although officially named the lands of \"Vera Cruz\" or \"Santa Cruz\" by the original discovers, it was during Loronha's tenure that the name of the land gradually transitioned to \"Terra do Brasil\" and its inhabitants to \"Brasileiros\". Some unkind authors claim that Loronha, on account of his Jewish roots, was uncomfortable with referring to the land after the True Cross. But the truth is probably more mundane. It was rather common for 15th- and 16th-century Portuguese to refer to distant lands by their commercial product rather than their proper name (e.g. Madeira Islands, Pepper Coast, Ivory Coast, Gold Coast, Spice Islands, etc.) The lands of Vera Cruz were simply popularly known as the \"Land of Brazil\" (\"Terra do Brasil\") for the same reason. (Curiously, some letters from the early 1500s refer to it as \"Terra di Papaga\", \"Land of Parrots\")\n\nMore curious is the demonym. In the Portuguese language, an inhabitant of Brazil is referred to as a \"Brasileiro\", although the suffix \"-eiro\" properly denotes occupations and not inhabitants (who are typically given the suffix \"-ano\" instead). A rough English equivalent might be the suffix \"-or\" (doctor, actor) or \"-er\" (carpenter, plumber) versus \"-an\" (Indian, American). Thus an inhabitant of Brazil should have become known in Portuguese as a \"Brasiliano\" (\"Brazilian\"), but uniquely among Portuguese demonyms they are instead referenced as a \"Brasileiro\" (\"Braziler\"). This stems from Loronha's tenure when \"brasileiro\" was indeed a reference to an occupation: a brazilwood cutter or trader. The name of the occupation was simply gradually extended to refer to all the inhabitants of the land.\n\n"}

This company continued in operation until the 1950s. Initially manufacturing valves and compressors for steam engines, and later whole steamships, Alley & MacLellan acquired Simpson and Bibby of Horsehay, manufacturer of steam powered road vehicles, in 1903. They began producing steam road vehicles in 1905 and in 1906 introduced a 5 ton vertical-boiler wagon, which featured a 2-cylinder undertype engine and chain drive.\n\nAround 1915 Alley & McLellan moved the steam wagon production to a new factory in England and it continued under a separate company (see below)., and in 1918 the company also opened a third factory in Worcester specialising in valve manufacture. Both factory buildings were prefabricated in Glasgow for local assembly and in both cases core Scottish employees transferred to the new sites.\n\nAlley & MacLellan continued to operate in the original Sentinel Works in Jessie Street, Glasgow until the 1950s. They produced a wide range of engineering products including compressors, valves, etc. The 'Sentinel' name continued to be used for the products of the original Glasgow works until the mid 20th Century.\n\nA new company \"Sentinel Waggon Works Ltd\" was formed when steam wagon production was switched to a new factory, opened at Shrewsbury in 1915. There were several other slight changes to the name over the company's lifetime when further infusions of working capital were required to obviate financial problems.\n\nAlley & MacLellan's early wagon was so successful that it remained in production with relatively few updates until the launch of Sentinel's famous Super in 1923. The company also produced steam railway locomotives and railcars, for railway companies and industrial customers.\n\nIn 1917, the company was bought by William Beardmore & Co., Ltd.\n\nIn 1920, after financial problems, the company was reorganised as Sentinel Waggon Works (1920) Ltd. The Sentinel 'Super' model that followed in 1923 was assembled in a radical new plant at Shrewsbury, with a flow line based on Henry Ford’s Model T factory at Highland Park, Michigan, with 1,550 vehicles produced.\n\nSentinel, along with Foden, dominated the steam market, but the 1930s saw the demise of both companies' ranges as new legislation forced the development of lighter lorries, Sentinel surviving the longest.\n\nIn 1934 Sentinel launched a new and advanced steamer – the S type which had a single-acting 4-cylinder underfloor engine with longitudinal crankshaft and an overhead worm-drive axle. Their Sentinel Waggon Works' design of 1935 led to the production of 3,750 Sentinel 'Standards' in the seventeen years that followed, the biggest selling steam lorry ever. It was lighter and featured a modernised driver's cab with a set-back boiler and was available in four, six and eight-wheel form, designated S4, S6 and S8. In spite of its sophisticated design, however, it could not compete with contemporary diesel trucks for all-round convenience and payload capacity, and was phased out in the late 1930s. It was not the end of Sentinel's involvement with steam, however; the company built about 100 \"S\" type vehicles for export to Argentina as late as 1950, for use by the Río Turbio coal mine. It has been stated that Sentinel were never paid for the last batch of the Río Turbio production run. At least two of the Río Turbio waggons survive in Argentina to this day.\n\nIn 1946 Thomas Hill's signed an agency agreement with Sentinel for repair and maintenance of diesel vehicles. In 1947 Sentinel offered to extend the agreement for diesel vehicles to include the steam locomotives and an agency was accepted by Thomas Hill for sales and servicing.\n\nIn 1947 the company became Sentinel (Shrewsbury) Ltd, and had developed a new range of diesel lorries. Despite Sentinel's superbly engineered vehicles, sales diminished throughout the 1950s, and by 1956 the company was forced to cease lorry production. The factory was acquired by Rolls-Royce for diesel engine production, and the remaining stock of parts and vehicles was taken over by Sentinel's chief dealer, North Cheshire Motors Ltd of Warrington, who formed a new company, Transport Vehicles (Warrington) Ltd, in 1957 to produce Sentinel-based designs under the TVW name.\n\nIn 1963 Thomas Hill's decided to renew the loco agreement and relinquish the diesel vehicle agency, concentrating all efforts on the steam locomotive work.\n\nDespite the various interesting developments, Rolls Royce did not consider railway locomotives to be part of their core business. They had agreed to complete all steam locos on order, and four steam receiver locos ordered by Dorman Long in 1956, but only after much consideration did Rolls-Royce finally agree at the end of 1957 to design and build a diesel locomotive of similar weight and power to the steam loco that had sold so well. Thomas Hill's would assist in the design and development of these diesel machines and would be the sole distributor.\n\nIn 1958 the last two Sentinel steam locos were delivered marking the end of an era. Two of the newly developed steam receiver locos were delivered and proved very satisfactory in service, but Dorman Long were not happy. There had been a change of heart among their engineers as well as a change of circumstances, and they were now favouring diesel locomotives. The last two steam receiver locos were built but never delivered and ultimately all four were converted to diesel hydraulic.\n\nThe prototype Sentinel diesel locomotive was built and ready to commence trials on the former Shropshire & Montgomeryshire Railway (then under military control) early in 1959. It met with the approval and enthusiasm of the Company's prospective customers and before the end of the year 17 locomotives had been sold and delivered. The company was ready to produce a maximum of four locomotives a month.\n\nBy 1963 four different Sentinel diesel models were being produced, commencing with the 34 ton chain drive 0-4-0 powered by the Rolls-Royce C6SFL six-cylinder engine of (gross) (later uprated to ). This was followed within a year by a 48-ton 0-6-0 rod coupled machine, fitted with a Rolls-Royce C8SFL eight-cylinder engine of (gross) (later uprated to ). Between 1963 and 1966 a fleet of these diesel locomotives, eventually numbering five 0-6-0s and 18 0-4-0s, was supplied to the Manchester Ship Canal Company for use on the navigation's private railway network.\n\nThese Sentinels demonstrated their suitability for heavy work, but heavier and more powerful locos were called for, particularly by the steel industry, and before the end of 1963 a 74ton 0-8-0 powered by paired C8SFL engines and a 40-ton 0-4-0 fitted with a C8SFL engine had been added to the range.\n\nA shaft drive 0-6-0 machine was now being developed at Shrewsbury using the new DV8T engine. Considerable interest in this loco was expressed by Stewart and Lloyds mineral division at Corby who were operating more than 20 steam locos, mainly of the Austerity type. This new locomotive \"Steelman\" was eventually delivered to Corby in late 1967, about two years overdue. The prototype locomotive proved satisfactory and three more were ordered by Stewart and Lloyds and one by Richard Thomas and Baldwins, Scunthorpe. Stewart and Lloyds' programme to replace more than 20 steam locos over the next few years the future for Steelman looked good.\n\nBritish Railways offered Stewart and Llords 26 second-hand Swindon-built class 14 diesel hydraulic locomotives. The rod-coupled Class 14 were powered by a Paxman engine with Voith Transmission and were capable of doing the work required at a fraction of the price of new Steelman locomotives. No further \"Steelman\" locos were built at Shrewsbury.\n\nIn 1979, ICI Billingham wanted two heavy locomotives to replace their ageing Yorkshire Janus locomotives. Their engineers visited many industrial sites, and steelworks in particular, to evaluate available locomotives. Their requirements were discussed with varios UK locomotive manufacturers, and they ordered an updated version of the Sentinel Steelman design. Two machines were delivered toward the end of 1981.\n\nUK sales of Sentinel locos were now fewer than 10 per year, their only overseas success had been to license the assembly of 36 0-6-0 locomotives by Sorefame for the Portuguese Railways in 1965/66. These locomotives became the CP Class 1150.\n\n\n\n\nThe locomotives and railcars (with a few exceptions) used the standard steam lorry boilers and engine units.\n\nCentre Engine\n\nBalanced Engine\n\nDouble Engine\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA special locomotive was produced at Sentinel, for Dorman Long and named \"Princess\". It consisted of 2 x 0-6-0 chassis coupled together to articulate. One unit carried the cab, a 5 drum oil-fired Woolnough boiler and two engines. The other unit housed the water and fuel tanks and also two more engines providing a total of . It was considered a magnificent machine by the staff but unfortunately was the only one of its kind ever built.\n\nAnother special was the NCB Gyro or Electrogyro Locomotive. Based on a 4-wheeled 0-4-0 frame fitted with two \"gyro units\" (see Flywheel energy storage) made by Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon of Switzerland. The gyros were principally a 3ton horizontal flywheel enclosed in a vessel filled with low pressure hydrogen. A vertically mounted three-phase squirrel-cage electric motor/generator was directly coupled to each flywheel shaft. The motor took its power from a side-mounted supply at static posts via a four-contact swinging arm extended or retracted pneumatically by the driver. Power could only be taken whilst the loco was stationary alongside one of these posts. When the gyros had reached the required speed, the driver would retract the contact arm, switch the motor to generation and controlled the locomotive in a similar way to a diesel-electric loco. Charging posts had to be strategically placed around the site. A contact arm was provided on each side of the locomotive, although it is not clear if posts were installed on one or both sides of the track. Each gyro operated between 3,000rpm when fully 'charged;' and 1,800rpm before recharging. Recharging took 2minutes and the locomotive could work for around 30 minutes before recharging. It weighed 34tons and had a maximum speed of .\n\nThis machine was specially built for the National Coal Board (NCB) at Seaton Delaval. The intention was to investigate the use of gyroscopic storage as a potential method for a flameproof and emissions-free underground locomotive. It operated from 1958, very satisfactorily, but was eventually taken out of service because of site development and its restricted field of operation. In April 1965 it was converted for the NCB to a diesel hydraulic machine.\n\nThe Receiver Locomotives were another special type built just for Dorman Long and were based on the idea of a Fireless locomotive.\n\n\nA number of Sentinel steam wagons and tractors exist in preservation in the UK—about 117 as of 2008. \nThey are often shown at steam fairs in the UK. For more information see the Sentinel Drivers Club website. A number also exist in Australia and other countries.\n\nThere are several surviving steam locomotives located at various heritage railways around the UK, including: the Elsecar Heritage Railway, the Middleton Railway, the Foxfield Light Railway and the Chasewater Railway.\n\nThree Sentinel steam locos were used at Amsted Maxion's railway equipment plant in Cruzeiro, SP (Brazil). All three were 0-4-0T locomotives built in 1931 to gauge. Two of them worked until 2014. They were the last commercially operating steam locomotives in Brazil until then. After they were shut down, they were bought by ABPF (Associação Brasileira de Preservação Ferroviária) after a long negotiation that took more than one year. Now they are preserved at ABPF shops in Cruzeiro, near Amsted Maxion's plant: \n\n\n\n"}

The city council's seats are as follows:\n\nThe finding of archeological remains corresponding to Iberian colonies (VI-I bC) and the Romans (I-V aC) - a noteworthy Roman bath is located near the river - suggests that the origins of Sant Boi can be found in pre-Roman times.\n\nLike most of the surrounding lands, from the 8th to the 11th century the town was controlled by the Moors, until their expulsion from Iberia during the Reconquista. The Moors called it \"Alcala\", which means castle, due to the existence of a hillock from where the river and the valley were dominated. Its present name derives from the name of Saint Baudilus, known as Boi or Baldiri in Catalonia.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages the village was progressively populated, growing from the surroundings of the castle to adjacent zones. A baroque-style church was built during the 16th century. The growth kept on during the following centuries, giving rise to numerous \"Masies\" (typical Catalan agricultural housing) near the river and the most fertile lands. At the end of the 19th century Sant Boi was a village of nearly 5000 inhabitants, with an economy mainly based in agriculture.\n\nAt the beginnings of the 20th century the first industries flourished in Sant Boi, ranging from brick manufacture to metalwork. With the end of the Spanish Civil War in 1939 there is a massive inflow of immigration coming from diverse points of the Spanish geography. These flows of population consisted mainly in people from villages and small towns searching a job and career opportunities in the town of Barcelona, stimulated by the increasing demand of workmanship in the regrowth of the Catalan industry during the postwar period. The population rises from 10.000 people in 1940 to 65.000 in 1975. This period is characterized by the construction of complete quarters (Casablanca, Camps Blancs, Cooperativa) dedicated to housing for the immigration.\n\nNowadays Sant Boi is a town with more than 80,000 inhabitants, with well-established industrial and services sectors, and a healthy cultural and recreational offer.\n\n\nThere is a rugby union club, UE Santboiana, and a football club, FC Santboià.\n\n\n\n"}

Naughton is best known as one-third of the R&B group 3LW and for her acting roles in \"Fame\", \"Notorious\", where she played Lil' Kim, and \"The Playboy Club\". Naughton was a series regular in season one of the Lifetime television drama series \"The Client List\" as Kendra. Naughton starred in the Starz drama \"Power\" as Tasha St. Patrick.\n\nNaughton was born and raised in East Orange, New Jersey, the daughter of Brenda, a part-time paralegal, and Ezra Naughton, a retired accountant. Her musical talent emerged at the age of five years, when she joined her church choir at New Hope Baptist Church (the same church where Whitney Houston performed in her youth) in Newark, New Jersey. She attended St. Joseph's Catholic school and Immaculate Conception High School in Montclair, New Jersey. She has sung the national anthem at various events in New Jersey and attended Seton Hall University.\n\nIn 1999, at age 15, Naughton joined Adrienne Bailon and Kiely Williams to form the group 3LW. Their first single, \"No More (Baby I'ma Do Right)\", was released in the fall of 2000. \"No More\" was a success and was followed by the second single, \"Playas Gon' Play\" in early 2001. The group's debut album, \"3LW\", was released on December 5, 2000. The album went platinum, selling 1.3 million copies in the U.S. In the summer of 2001, the group went on the MTV TRL tour along with Destiny's Child, Dream, Nelly, Eve, and Jessica Simpson.\n\n3LW spent the first half of 2002 in the studio, recording an album tentatively titled \"Same Game, Different Rules\". The album and its intended lead single \"Uh Oh\" were presented to the label, who felt it did not have enough urban radio appeal. The tracks from \"Same Game, Different Rules\" were leaked to the Internet in MP3 format, and Epic considered dropping the band. A fan support campaign for 3LW named 'Never Let Go of 3LW' followed, and the act was retained. Recording a new set of tracks, 3LW returned in the summer of 2002 with the P. Diddy-produced single \"I Do (Wanna Get Close To You)\", featuring Loon.\n\nBy August 2002, the group was set to release its newest LP, \"A Girl Can Mack\", when Naughton announced that she was no longer a member of the group. Naughton says that the other two girls and their management had forced her out. The problems reached a breaking point after a heated argument with Williams, Bailon, and their manager, which allegedly ended with Williams throwing a hot plate full of KFC food at Naughton. Epic Records then ended their relationship with both 3LW and Naughton. Despite Naughton's departure both Bailon and Williams resumed as a duo for a short amount of time and later Jessica Benson became Naughton's replacement. The group has since disbanded. In May 2017, she reunited with former groupmate Bailon on the daytime talk show \"The Real\", who promoted the season premiere of \"Power\".\n\nNaughton recorded five tracks for the \"Fame\" soundtrack which was released on August 25, 2009. The following month Naughton scored her first solo chart entry ever with her cover of \"Fame\" peaking at No. 33 on the UK Singles Chart. The single also reached the Top 20 in Finland, Portugal and Norway. In 2010 an extended play was released titled \"Fame Presents Naturi Naughton as Denise: Didn't I Tell You\". The EP included tracks already heard before as well as previously unreleased tracks.\n\nIn February 2010, when appearing on the BET talk show \"The Mo'Nique Show\", Naughton expressed interest in recording a solo-debut album. However, Naughton has revealed she is instead focusing on her acting career but has not ruled out an album. An ensemble of demos have leaked to the internet, including a duet with Lil' Kim. However, it is unknown whether or not they will be released on her debut album. She was believed to be working with music producer Full Force at the time.\n\nThroughout 2005 to 2008, Naughton starred in the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical \"Hairspray\" as Little Inez. In March 2008 Naughton was cast to portray Grammy Award-winning rap artist Lil' Kim in \"Notorious\", a biopic film about The Notorious B.I.G. The film was released in January 2009 to mixed reviews and went on to make over $43 million worldwide. Lil' Kim has stated that she wasn't mad at Naughton who portrayed her and that she was mad at how they portrayed her.\n\nNaughton was cast as Denise, an aspiring singer, in the Lionsgate remake of the 1980 film of the same name \"Fame\". Filming took place in New York City and Los Angeles in November and December 2008. The film was released in September 2009 and opened No. 3 at the U.S. box office in its opening weekend despite negative reviews from critics. The film went on to make $77 million worldwide.\n\nIn August 2010, Naughton was announced to appear in an episode of the AMC drama television series \"Mad Men\". Naughton portrays the role of Toni Charles, a Playboy Bunny mistress to the character Lane Pryce. The episode, \"Hands and Knees\", aired on September 26, 2010. The role marked the second time Naughton portrayed a fictional Playboy Bunny. That same month Naughton appeared in the Warner Bros. Pictures comedy film \"Lottery Ticket\".\n\nIn March 2011, Naughton appeared in the drama television series pilot \"The Playboy Club\" which centers around the lives of the employees of the original Playboy Club operating in Chicago. The series was picked up by NBC in May 2011. Naughton portrayed the role of Brenda, a Playboy Bunny who dreams of being the first African-American Playboy centerfold. The series premiered on September 19, 2011 and was cancelled after three episodes due to low ratings.\n\nIn October 2011, Naughton appeared in an episode of the sitcom \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\". Naughton portrays the role of a 1970s jazz club singer named Shadynasty.\n\nIn December 2011, Naughton was announced to have been cast in the Lifetime drama television series \"The Client List\" opposite Jennifer Love Hewitt. The series is a re-imagining of the 2010 film of the same name \"The Client List\". Naughton portrays the role of Kendra a hard-working masseuse at a parlor. The series premiered on April 8, 2012 to 2.79 million viewers and mixed reviews from critics. In May 2012 Lifetime renewed the series for a 15-episode second season.\n\nIn September 2012, Naughton starred in the BET original film \"Let The Church Say Amen\" which is adapted from author ReShonda Tate Billingsley's 2005 best-selling novel of the same name. The film was the directorial debut of actress Regina King.\n\nNaughton starred in the Starz drama \"Power\" as Tasha St. Patrick, the wife of James \"Ghost\" St. Patrick played by Omari Hardwick, a New York nightclub owner living a double life as a drug kingpin. She won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, for the third season.\n\nIn March 2017, Naughton announced that she was expecting her first child.

During that time, he studied the use of silastic for the sustained release of lipophilic drugs; the 1964 publication of that work helped inspire the technological development of the Norplant implantable contraceptive at the Population Council.\n\nThe navy research was focused on developing artificial blood; in the course of testing potential products to see if they could keep alive thymus glands taken from rabbits, he noticed that tumors in the gland couldn't grow, as they did if the glands were perfused with blood. His curiosity as to why led to his work on angiogenesis.\n\nAfter his two years work for the navy, Folkman completed his residency at Massachusetts General Hospital. He worked as an assistant surgeon at Boston City Hospital, then trained further in pediatric surgery at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia under C. Everett Koop. In 1967 he was appointed surgeon-in-chief of Children's Hospital Boston at the age of 34. Folkman was appointed the Julia Dyckman Andrus Professor of Pediatric Surgery at Harvard Medical School in 1968, where he was also Professor of Cell Biology. He was the youngest full Professor at Harvard Medical School in history. In addition to directing the Children's Hospital Boston Surgical Research Laboratories, which grew to become the Vascular Biology Program, for nearly four decades, he was the Scientific Director of the hospital's Vascular Anomalies Center.\n\nIn 1971, he reported in the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" that solid tumors are angiogenesis-dependent. He hypothesized that there was an unknown \"factor\" that tumors secreted to help it increase its blood supply, and that if that factor could be blocked, tumors would wither and die. Though his hypothesis was initially disregarded and treated with skepticism by most experts in the field, Folkman persisted with his research. He and collaborators, who included Bert L. Vallee, soon identified the already-known fibroblast growth factor as an angiogenic factor, but the team's work showed that there were additional, unknown factors. To help accelerate the work, Folkman started collaborating with industry. In 1974 Harvard University and Monsanto signed a ten-year industrial-funded research grant to support his cancer research, which at that time was the largest such arrangement ever made; medical inventions arising from that research were the first for which Harvard allowed its faculty to submit a patent application. Robert Langer worked as a postdoc in Folkman's lab during this time, concentrating on using silastic and other materials to deliver drugs.\n\nIn the mid to late 1980s, two other angiogenic factors were identified by other labs that had been inspired by his work: angiogenin and VEGF. With the factors identified, drug discovery could begin. When the Monsanto agreement (which yielded no products for Monsanto) ended, Folkman started receiving research funding from Takeda and then from a startup company, Entremed, that put half its venture capital funding into research in the Folkman lab.\n\nDonald E. Ingber soon discovered that a fungus, \"Aspergillus fumigatus\", secreted a chemical, fumagillin, that inhibited angiogenesis. Takeda performed medicinal chemistry to optimize it, leading to development of TNP-470. Folkman's team later tested it in adults with hemangiomas; they also used interferon alpha, an already approved drug that they had already shown to be an angiogenesis inhibitor, to treat infants with hemangiomas in some of the first clinical trials of angiogenesis inhibitors which were published in 1992. In these trials they also studied the levels of fibroblast growth factor in the urine of the trial subjects and published that work in 1994; these were some of the first explorations of the use of biomarkers in clinical trials as surrogate endpoints.\n\nIn 1991 Michael O\"Reilly, working in the Folkman lab with Entremed funding, discovered the first endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor, angiostatin and then another, endostatin. Entremed began developing them and soon struck a collaboration with Bristol-Myers, which caught national interest and spurred further investment in angiogenesis inhibitors by other pharma companies.\n\nIn 1993 he surprised the scientific world by hypothesizing that angiogenesis is as important in blood cancers as it is in solid tumors, and the next year he published work showing that a biomarker of angiogenesis was higher in all people with cancer, but especially high in people with blood cancers, and other evidence of the role of angiogenesis in blood cancers emerged as well. Meanwhile, a member of his lab, Robert D'Amato, was looking for angiogenesis inhibitors, and discovered that thalidomide inhibited angiogenesis in 1994. Around that time, the wife of a man who was dying of multiple myeloma and whom standard treatments had failed, called Folkman asking him about his anti-angiogenesis ideas. Folkman convinced the patient's doctor to try thalidomide, and that doctor ended up conducting a clinical trial of thalidomide for people with multiple myeloma in which about a third of the subjects responded to the treatment. The results of that trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1999.\n\nIn 2004, the first angiogenesis inhibitor, bevacizumab (Avastin), was approved by the FDA, as a treatment for colon cancer. It is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that was discovered and developed by Napoleone Ferrara. a scientist at Genentech. A similar drug, Lucentis, was later approved for treating macular degeneration. After further work was done by Celgene and others, in 2006 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval for thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients.\n\nFolkman was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, the National Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society, among others. He was the author of some 400 papers and more than 100 book chapters and monographs and received scores of United States awards and honors for his research as well as numerous international awards, including the George Ledlie Prize from Harvard, Canada's Gairdner Foundation International Award, Israel's Wolf Prize, Germany's Ernst Schering Prize, the United Kingdom Society for Endocrinology's Dale Medal in 2000, Prince of Asturias Award and Switzerland's Dr. Josef Steiner Cancer Research Award. In 2005 he was awarded the Scientific Grand Prize of the Lefoulon-Delalande Foundation. In 2006, Folkman was one of seven people appointed by President Bush to the National Cancer Advisory Board of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nFor his discoveries which originated the concept and developed the field of angiogenesis research, Folkman was awarded the Wolf Prize in Medicine in 1992.\n\nHe was awarded the Massry Prize from the Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California in 1997.\nOn May 29, 1998 Folkman received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of \nMedicine at Uppsala University, Sweden\n\nFolkman died of a heart attack in Denver on January 14, 2008 at the age of 74 en route to deliver the 2008 Keynote Address at the Keystone Symposium (Molecular Mechanisms of Angiogenesis in Development and Disease) in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nHe was survived by his wife, Paula, whom he met and married while doing his surgical residency, two daughters, and a granddaughter.\n\n\n"}

() also known by the initialism HAHK, is a 1994 Indian Hindi-language romantic drama film written and directed by Sooraj Barjatya and produced by Rajshri Productions. The film stars Madhuri Dixit and Salman Khan in the lead roles. The film celebrates the Indian wedding traditions by relating the story of a married couple and the relationship between their families; a story about sacrificing one's love for one's family. It is an adaptation of the studio's earlier film \"Nadiya Ke Paar\" (1982), which was based on Keshav Prasad Mishra's Hindi novel \"Kohbar Ki Shart\".\n\nEarning worldwide, \"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\" became the highest-grossing Indian film. It contributed to a change in the Indian film industry, with new methods of distribution and a turn towards less violent stories. It was the first Indian film to gross over , and when adjusted for inflation, is the highest grossing Indian film of the 1990s and also still one of the highest-earning Bollywood films ever. Box Office India described it as \"the biggest blockbuster of the modern era.\" The film was also dubbed into the Telugu language and released with the title \"Premalayam\". The 14-song soundtrack, an unusually large number, is also one of the most popular in Bollywood history, with popular singer Lata Mangeshkar lending her voice for 11 of the 14 songs in the film.\n\n\"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\" won five Filmfare Awards, including Best Film, Best Director, and Best Actress, as well as winning the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. It made a lasting impact on wedding celebrations in India, which often include songs and games from the film.\n\nBrothers Prem and Rajesh lost their parents at an early age. They live with their uncle Kailash Nath. Rajesh manages the family business and his family is on the look-out for a suitable bride for him. One day, Kailash meets his college friend, Siddharth Chaudhary, who is now a professor, after several years. Siddharth and his wife Madhukala have two daughters named Pooja and Nisha. Siddharth and Kailash arrange marriage between Rajesh and Pooja. From their first meeting, Nisha and Prem start bickering lightheartedly with each other, and the fun and mischief continue throughout Pooja and Rajesh's wedding.\n\nPrem has an amicable relationship with Rajesh's warm-hearted sister-in-law Nisha. In time, Pooja and Rajesh realise their love for each other, and it is revealed that Pooja is expecting a child. Siddharth and Madhukala are unable to come to Kailash's house for the ceremony marking the impending arrival of the baby. They send Nisha instead, who is present at the birth. Meanwhile, Nisha and Prem fall in love with each other, but keep it a secret. Siddharth and Madhukala come over to Kailash's house to celebrate the birth of their grandchild. When the time comes to part, their hosts are dejected, especially Prem. He and Nisha promise each other that they will soon reunite forever.\n\nPooja is invited to stay at her parents' house, and Prem takes her there. When they arrive, Pooja learns that Prem and Nisha are in love, and gives Nisha a necklace as a token, promising to get them married. Shortly afterward, Pooja accidentally slips, falling down from the stairs, and eventually dies from a head injury. Everybody is shattered by the tragedy.\n\nNisha takes good care of Pooja and Rajesh's son. Hence, Siddharth and Kailash feel that Nisha will be a great mother to the baby. They decide to have Nisha marry Rajesh. Nisha overhears Siddharth and Madhukala talking about her marriage into Kailash's family and thinks that they are discussing her marriage to Prem, to which she agrees. Later, at a pre-nuptial ceremony, she finds out that she is actually going to marry Rajesh.\n\nPrem and Nisha vow to sacrifice their love for Rajesh and the son. Moments before the wedding, Nisha asks Prem's dog Tuffy to give Prem the necklace that Pooja had given her, along with a letter. Tuffy exits Nisha's room and instead of taking the letter to Prem, delivers it to Rajesh. Rajesh reads the letter and realises that Prem and Nisha love each other. Subsequently, he halts the wedding and confronts both Nisha and Prem. In the end, Nisha and Prem marry each other with the consent of their families.\n\nDirector/writer Sooraj Barjatya devoted one year and nine months to write the screenplay of \"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\". He spent the first five months trying to write another \"Maine Pyar Kiya\", but then started over after his father Rajkumar Barjatya suggested that he rework one of the family company Rajshri Productions earlier offerings. \"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\" then became a loose adaptation of their 1982 production \"Nadiya Ke Paar\". Barjatya used musical numbers to avoid treating some situations in a cliché manner, which resulted in so many songs that there were complaints during initial screenings of the film concerning its length and number of songs. Barjayta's grandfather, company founder Tarachand Barjatya, loved the song \"Dhiktana\" so much that the film was nearly given that title.\n\nBarjatya later told \"India Abroad\", \"My attempt in this movie has been to reexpose the cinema-going public to the quintessential family life ... not to make people feel that they have come to see a movie, but make them feel as if they have come to visit a big joint family that is preparing for a wedding\". The story was constructed differently than what was popular at the time. There were no villains, violence, or battles between good and evil. From conception to finished product, the film took four years. Madhuri Dixit was paid a salary of for playing Nisha. Aamir Khan was initially offered the role of Prem, but he declined the offer due to being dissatisfied with the script. It then went to Salman Khan, helping him to become a superstar.\n\nThe producers/distributors exercised a higher than normal level of control over their work. There was a limited release, a new form of television publicity, safeguards against video piracy, and a delay in the releasing of video tapes.\n\nThe soundtrack for \"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\" was composed by Raamlaxman (original name Vijay Patil) who had earlier given music for Rajshri's \"Maine Pyar Kiya\", with lyrics by Ravinder Rawal and Dev Kohli. It was produced under the Sa Re Ga Ma label which at that time was known as HMV (short for His Master's Voice) and featured veteran playback singers such as Lata Mangeshkar, S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, Kumar Sanu, Udit Narayan, Shailendra Singh and Sharda Sinha. Raamlaxman had about 50 sessions with the director Barjatya during scripting. The finished soundtrack included an unusually large number of songs at 14 (15 if we count the sad version of the song \"Mujhse Juda Hokar\" which appears in the movie but not on the Music Album), plus the song \"Hasta Hua Noorani Chehra\" (from the film \"Parasmani\"), that was used when the characters play a game. The track \"Didi Tera Devar Deewana\" is said to be inspired by Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's song \"Saare Nabian\". That song became one of the most popular film songs ever, and was on the charts for over a year. The soundtrack was very successful upon release, becoming the best selling Bollywood soundtrack of the year, and one of the top four sellers of the 1990s, with 12million units sold. It was ranked the number 29 all-time best Hindi soundtrack by Planet Bollywood.\n\n\"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\" premiered at Liberty Cinema in southern Mumbai on 5 August 1994; it eventually ran there for over 100 weeks. The film initially saw a very limited release, also showing at the Regal and Eros theatres, with only 26 prints total. Eventually it started to appear in many more theatres. When initial viewers complained about the film's length, 2 of the 14 song sequences were removed. These were later restored when film goers were found to enjoy all of the songs. Early reviewers of \"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\" predicted that it would be a huge flop; hence the industry was stunned when it went on to become the most successful film of all time up to that point.\n\n\"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\" is one of the biggest grossers ever in the history of Indian cinema, and is said to have changed film business forever in the country. Made on a budget of around (), it went on to gross an estimated in India, making it the first to gross over 1 billion. Box Office India gave it the verdict \"All Time Blockbuster\", and described it as \"the biggest blockbuster of the modern era.\" Much of the success was due to repeat business. For example, painter M. F. Husain was reported to have seen the film over 60 times. The film's domestic net income was , which adjusted for inflation is equivalent to (), making it the highest-grossing Hindi film in India since \"Sholay\" (1975). \"Hum Aapke Hain Koun\" sold 74million tickets in India, giving it the highest domestic footfalls of any Hindi film released since the 1990s.\n\nWorldwide, the film grossed over () in its first year, for which it was awarded the Guinness World Record for \"Highest grossing Indian movie\". By 1996, the film's total worldwide gross was ().\n\n\"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\" received generally positive reviews. \"India Abroad\" called it a \"cloyingly familial and touchingly sad melodrama replete with typical Indian social situations\".\n\nRedo, an Indian Spitz, received favourable recognition as Tuffy the dog. He was included in the \"Best pets in Hindi films\" list compiled by \"Daily News and Analysis\". After the film, Redo was reportedly adopted by actress Madhuri Dixit.\n\n\"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\" won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. The film was nominated for 13 Filmfare Awards, including Best Film, Best Director, and Best Actress. The film went on to win five awards making it one of the biggest winners of the year. Lata Mangeshkar, who sang more than 10 songs in the movie, had long retired from accepting awards, but the public demand for the song \"Didi Tera Devar Deewana\" was such that she received the Filmfare Special Award that year.\n\nThe film also won major awards at the newly introduced 'Screen Awards', where it won six awards.\n\nAuthor Kovid Gupta classified \"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\" as a film that bridges the gap between traditionalism and modernity. He discussed the songs of the films in particular, and the \"manifestation of romance under the acceptance and blessings of the family, in specific, the elder sister-in-law\". Patricia Uberoi called the film a family film in two ways; it is about family relationships, and it is suitable for the entire family to watch. She said that the film is not about the two leads, but about the family, an ideal family. Tejaswini Ganti has called the film a \"paean to filial duty\" for how the children are willing to sacrifice their love for the good of their families. The family relationships are also noted for being different from the normal cinematic families of the time due to their mutual civility. Rediff.com noted that \"Though the film was initially dismissed as a wedding video, its success indicated that post-liberalisation, Indian audiences still clung to the comfort of the familiar.\" Jigna Desai said that the film's popularity was due to interactions of the families around the traditional folk wedding practices. In his study on the response to the film, academic Vamsee Juluri concluded that the celebration of the family is \"HAHK\"'s \"most useful contribution to history\".\n\n\"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\" is credited as being a defining moment in Hindi cinema's box office history, and the beginning of a revolution in the Indian film distribution system. When it was released, cinema was in decline in India due to improved cable television, home video, and film piracy. The film was originally released in only a small number of theatres that agreed to upgrade their facilities. Due to widespread demand for the film, many other theatres upgraded in order to get the film. Although ticket prices were raised, the upgraded theatres brought people back who had been lost to television. Also, the film's lack of vulgarity was a sign to middle-class family patrons that they could return to the theatre. This film, in addition to the following year's \"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge\", contributed to an increase in Indian cinema attendance of 40% in just two years.\n\nThe film was so successful that it literally gave the term blockbuster new meaning in India. Box Office India said, \"\"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\" [...] took business for films released afterwards to another level. To put into perspective how business changed [...] before \"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\" an all India share of 10 crore for a big film was regarded as blockbuster business but after \"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\" the blockbuster business figure went to 20 crore.\"\n\n\"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\" influenced many subsequent Hindi films. The film was also a trendsetter for glamorous family dramas and NRI-related films, and started Bollywood's \"big-fat-wedding-film\" trend. In 1998 a theatre company in London, where the film had played for a year, staged a production based on the film titled \"Fourteen Songs, Two Weddings and a Funeral\". Planet Bollywood has noted that no wedding is complete without some songs from this film, and it has been used as a script to design wedding plans. For years afterwards, women wanted to wear a purple sari like the one worn by Madhuri Dixit in the song \"Didi Tera Devar Deewana\".\n\nFilmmaker Karan Johar named it as the one film that changed his life. He said, \"After seeing \"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\" I realized Indian cinema is about values, tradition, subtlety, romance. There is so much soul in it. [...] I decided to go ahead and be a filmmaker only after watching this film.\" \"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\" belongs to a small collection of films, including \"Kismet\" (1943), \"Mother India\" (1957), \"Mughal-e-Azam\" (1960) and \"Sholay\" (1975), which are repeatedly watched throughout India and are viewed as definitive Hindi films with cultural significance.\n\n"}

Caminha wrote the detailed official report of the April 1500 discovery of Brazil by Cabral's fleet (\"Carta de Pêro Vaz de Caminha\", dated 1 May, 1500). He died in a riot in Calicut, India, at the end of that year.\n\nPêro Vaz de Caminha was the son of Vasco Fernandes de Caminha, a knight of the household of the Duke of Guimarães (later Braganza). His ancestors were among the first settlers of Neiva during the reign of Ferdinand I (r.1367–83). On 8 March 1476, Pêro Vaz de Caminha was appointed \"mestre da balança\" (master of the scale) of the royal mint of Porto, one of the many positions held by his father at the time. The appointment letter, which characterized Pêro Vaz as a knight of the royal household, was written from Toro, suggesting that Pêro Vaz had accompanied King Afonso V of Portugal on campaign against Castile, and probably participated in the Battle of Toro (2 March 1476). In 1497, he was chosen to write, as Alderman, the Chapters of the Porto City Council, to be presented to the Cortes of Lisbon. \n\nIn 1500, Pêro Vaz de Caminha, already at advanced age, was appointed as secretary of the factory projected to be built in Calicut, India, under the designated royal factor Aires Correia. Correia and Caminha sailed aboard the flagship of the 2nd India armada under Pedro Álvares Cabral that set out from Lisbon in March 1500. Charting a wide arc in the south Atlantic, the armada stumbled on the landmass of Brazil on 22 April 1500, and anchored near Porto Seguro, Bahia. After about a week of idling on the beach, interacting with the local Tupiniquim natives, the fleet prepared to resume their journey to India. \n\nBefore departing, Cabral instructed Pêro Vaz de Caminha to write a letter to King Manuel I of Portugal, officially reporting the discovery of this new land – or island, as they initially believed. Caminha's letter (\"Carta de Pêro Vaz de Caminha\") gives a detailed report of the expedition up to that point, and of the new land and people they had discovered. Caminha's letter is dated 1 May and signed from the location of \"\"deste Porto Seguro da vossa ilha da Vera Cruz\"\" (\"this Safe Harbor of your island of the True Cross\"), the name Cabral bestowed in honor of Feast of the Cross (3 May in the liturgical calendar). \n\nCaminha's official report and an additional separate letter by the astronomer-physician Mestre João Faras, were given to one of Cabral's captains (either Gaspar de Lemos or André Gonçalves, sources conflict). who set sail back to Portugal on a supply ship they had brought along. The rest of the fleet left Brazil on 3 May, 1500, in the direction of the Cape of Good Hope and then onto India.\n\nPêro Vaz de Caminha's letter is often celebrated as the \"birth certificate\" of Brazil, although given the secrecy with which Kingdom of Portugal has always involved reports of its discoveries, it was only published in the nineteenth century by Father Manuel Aires de Casal in his \"Corografia Brasílica\".\n\nThe 2nd Armada arrived on the Malabar Coast of India in September 1500, and the factory was promptly set up in Calicut (\"Calecute\", Kozhikode). Caminha, the factory's secretary, assumed his duties there. However, a conflict soon arose between the Portuguese traders and the established Arab merchant guilds in the city. Finding little vent for their trade goods, the Portuguese suspected the Arabs were colluding to shut them out of the city's spice markets by organizing a boycott. The ruling Zamorin of Calicut refused to intervene, prompting the frustrated factor Aires Correia to take matters into his own hands. In late December 1500, after the Portuguese set about seizing the spice cargoes of Arab boats in the harbor, a riot erupted on the piers. Calicut mobs overran the Portuguese factory, killing every Portuguese they could get their hands on. Some fifty to seventy Portuguese perished in the riot – including the factor Aires Correia and, it is commonly supposed, the factory's secretary Pêro Vaz de Caminha. \n\nIn a royal letter dated 3 December 1501, King Manuel I of Portugal appointed Caminha's grandson, Rodrigo d'Osouro, to his grandfather's post at the Porto mint, noting explicitly that Pêro Vaz de Caminha had \"died in India\".\n\n\n"}

He married Brites Rodrigues de Brito sometime before 1495 and had several children: Nicolau, Francisco, Joana, Jorge, and Leonor.\n\nNicolau Coelho was a Portuguese explorer and one of the three captains (along with Paulo da Gama and Gonçalo Nunes) who accompanied Vasco da Gama in the Discovery of the sea route to India on July 8, 1497. He was the captain of the \"Berrio\" during this exploration and had as his navigator, Pêro Escobar. He was the first of Gama's captains to reach Mozambique, and establish contact with the sultan of Quiloa. He was also the first of Gama's armada to arrive in Lisbon, on July 10, 1499 where King Manuel I of Portugal bestowed to him a pension of 50,000 reis per year, 30,000 in interest for his lands and his descendants and a new coat of arms. He was made Knight of the Royal House (Cavaleiro da Casa Real) that same year.\n\nOn March 9, 1500, he accompanied Pedro Álvares Cabral in the discovery of Brazil being one of the captains of the fleet of 13 ships. After landing in Brazil, the fleet resumed their voyage east on May 3, 1500 where they were struck by a great storm near the Cape of Good Hope losing 4 vessels in the process and they continued with stops in modern-day Mozambique, Kenya, and Tanzania before finally reaching Calicut in India on September 13, 1500. The fleet returned to Lisbon on June 23, 1501. Cabral arrived back home with only 4 of the original 13 ships. \nCoelho left Portugal for a third time on April 14, 1503 as captain of the \"Faial\" with the armada of Afonso de Albuquerque, but died while returning home to Portugal in January 1504 along with Francisco de Albuquerque, Afonso's cousin, near the shallows of São Lázaro, modern day Quirimbas Islands, Mozambique.\n\n\n"}

It operates scheduled services in the Middle East, India and Europe. Its main base is Kuwait International Airport. The airline has grown since its launch to become Kuwait's second national airline.\nJazeera Airways is one of the largest operators at Kuwait airport, having handled a quarter of all aircraft movements and passengers at the airport during July 2009.\nAccording to the July 2009 report issued by Kuwait Directorate General for Civil Aviation's, Jazeera Airways had the largest number of aircraft movement in the month with 1834 take-offs and landings, overpassing the second largest carrier in aircraft movement by 4% .\n\nIn 2004 the Kuwait Government permitted the establishment of the non-governmental airline firm, essentially ending Kuwait's 50-year-old dependency on Kuwait Airways. The 2004 Emiree Decree #89 established Jazeera Airways as the first airline to enter this newly liberalized industry. \nJazeera Airways raised its capital of KD 10 million (US$35 million) through an initial public offering in Kuwait that was oversubscribed 12 times. The capital was doubled to KD 20 million (US$70 million) in 4Q 2007 by a second offering to existing shareholders. In May 2009, a share distribution of 10% effectively increased the capital to KD 22 million (US$77 million).\n\nAbout 26% of the airline is owned by two companies affiliated with the Boodai Group: Wings Finance (9%) and Boodai Projects (17%). 6-7% is also held by Jasem M. al-Mousa Trading, a company owned by a former Minister of Public Works in the first Kuwaiti government established after the end of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. About 17.5% is held by two real estate companies, and the rest is publicly held.\n\nJazeera Airways started operations on 30 October 2005 with a fleet of brand new Airbus A320 aircraft, all leather seats, flying to several destinations in the Middle East.\n\nIn Q2 2009, UAE authorities requested the airline to terminate its hub operations at Dubai. This step was seen as a support to Dubai's upcoming launch of its own low-cost airline, FlyDubai. Jazeera changed its operation model by concentrating on its Kuwait hub and trying to launch a second hub somewhere else. By Q2 2010, the new model proved unprofitable as the Kuwait hub suffered from overcapacity. The airline changed its plans by cancelling many stations and parking some aircraft which were later returned to lessor.\n\nIn 2018, Jazeera Airways opened their own dedicated terminal at Kuwait International Airport. The facility is claimed to be the first owned, built and operated by a private airline in the Middle East. It features a dedicated check-in hall for Jazeera passengers, Business Class lounge, direct access to Jazeera boarding gates, and a car park with 350 spaces connected by a sky bridge.\n\nJazeera Airways flies to destinations across the Middle East and Europe from its base in Kuwait. Since 2018, the company has expanded its available routes.\nIn October 2019, Jazeera Airways launched its first flight to London, bringing the first new service from Kuwait to the UK in 55 years. It operates the flight to London Gatwick Airport's South Terminal with its newest A320neo aircraft.\n\nIn 2018, Jazeera Airways opened their own dedicated terminal at Kuwait International Airport.

It features a dedicated check-in hall for Jazeera passengers, business class lounge, direct access to Jazeera boarding gates, and a car park with 350 spaces connected by a sky bridge.\n\nThe Jazeera Airways fleet consists of the following aircraft (as of January 2020):\n\nThe last of the A320s was delivered from Airbus on 9 January 2010.\n\nThe airline's fleet is powered by CFM56-5B engines. The airline has contracted Lufthansa Technik to maintain and service them. All Jazeera Airways aircraft are fitted with 165 leather seats, and split into two cabins: Jazeera and Jazeera Business. When Jazeera business is offered, six seats are cancelled to provide 12 Plus seats in addition to 147 Economy seats. \n\nJazeera Airways ordered 30 Airbus A320s on 18 June 2007. This was announced at the Paris Air Show bringing its total orders up to 35 Airbus A320s.\n\nDuring 2010, due to the airline's change of operation plans, several aircraft were parked, and eventually five were returned to lessor Sahaab which leased them to Virgin America and SriLankan Airlines.\n\nIn April 2011, Jazeera Airways canceled 25 of the 40 A320s it ordered in 2007. Jazeera will take delivery of four A320s still on order from 2012-2014.\n\nIn 2018, Jazeera Airways took deliveries of the first Airbus A320neo aircraft in the Middle East, and is putting the service on their Dubai route.\nIn 2019 September Jazeera also planned to order A321LR\nThey also started their world longest A320 family route which is 6 hours from Kuwait it’s hub to London Gatwick \n\nThe airline offers business and economy class seating.

They started out firmly grounded in the underground punk scene. Over time, Feeling B's popularity grew greatly, and climaxed around the end of the German Democratic Republic.\n\nFrontman Aljoscha Rompe (1947–2000), a Swiss living in East Berlin, supplied the vocals to the band's songs. Rompe, guitarist Paul Landers, and keyboardist Christian \"Flake\" Lorenz were the only consistent members throughout the band's history. At various times, the band also included bassist Christoph Zimmermann and drummers Alexander Kriening and Christoph \"Doom\" Schneider. Landers, Lorenz, and Schneider later found fame with Rammstein.\n\nFirst Arsch drummer and future Rammstein singer Till Lindemann, also participated once with Feeling B for the song \"Lied von der unruhevollen Jugend\", an interpretation of a Russian communist song, for which he is credited on the album \"Hea Hoa Hoa Hea Hea Hoa\". In return, Landers contributed guitar to First Arsch's 1992 album \"Saddle Up\". Lindemann and Landers, as members of Rammstein, would perform this song live in St. Petersburg and Moscow in 2001, during that band's 'Mutter' tour.\n\nThe group disbanded the mid-1990s. On special occasions, the band members would get together for individual concerts at punk festivals, until Rompe died in November 2000 of an asthma attack at 53 years old. Zimmermann died in a plane crash in 1999. Eventually, Lorenz re-discovered tapes of old and partial unreleased recordings. This unreleased material and remixes of some already known songs were released as \"Grün & Blau\" in 2007.\n\n\n"}

It was conducted in two rounds, under a preferential voting system. Former Minister André Boisclair was elected at the first round ballot with 53.7% of votes from party members, making him the first openly gay leader of a major political party in North America, and one of the first in the world.\n\nOn June 4, 2005, party leader Bernard Landry announced his intention to resign as leader of the PQ after getting 76.2% in a vote of confidence in his leadership from delegates to the party National Council. The party appointed Louise Harel as its interim leader. Gilles Duceppe, leader of the federal-level sovereigntist political party, the Bloc Québécois, was expected to be a strong candidate if he had decided to run. On June 11, he however announced that he would remain leader of the Bloc despite pressure to make a bid for the leadership of the PQ.\n\nAfter months of pre-campaign, the race officially began on September 15, 2005, the official deadline for entering the race. Soon, Boisclair emerged as a favorite in the polls, with Pauline Marois second, Richard Legendre a close third and Louis Bernard fourth. The validity of these polls, much touted by the media, was however challenged by some candidate organizations since they were conducted on the whole population of Quebec, rather than the actual voter pool, the legal members of the Parti Québécois. Also criticized was the intense media focus on the four candidates leading in these said polls, leaving the ideas of the other candidates in the dark. The later were much less discussed and their opening monologues were even cut for pundit commentary in LCN live broadcastings of the official candidates' debates.\n\nA controversy made some impression, albeit briefly, on the campaign: the said \"Affaire Boisclair\". On September 10, 2005, \"Le Devoir\" columnist Michel David referred in his column to a relatively unnoticed past article of \"Le Droit\" alluding to rumours of André Boisclair having lived a wild younger life and taken cocaine. Boisclair initially recognized a youth of partying and mistakes. Days later, after much media pressure, he admitted having \"consumed\". Ironically, this only made his popularity stronger in polling, something credited by pundits to popular sympathy in the face of the weight of the media scrutiny. The fact that Boisclair came out in 2000 on the subject of his homosexuality did not hampered his campaign either. Polls showed that more than 90% of Quebecers were not opposed to a gay Premier of Quebec. On public perceptions, Pauline Marois also raised the theory that her campaign was hurt by the fact that she is female.\n\nBoisclair being the frontrunner, he became the target of many other candidates and their supporters. Adding to the \"wild past\" problematic, some progressive militants put into question Boisclair's left-wing values. A group of most progressive candidates, Pierre Dubuc, Jean Ouimet, Gilbert Paquette and Jean-Claude St-André, soon grew closer to Marois, not only because of her experience and her safer known past, but also because of perceived stronger progressive values. Shortly before the vote, Paquette withdrew, announcing his support for Marois. The SPQ-Libre asked the Dubuc supporters to vote Marois as second choice, as did Ouimet. Ghislain Lebel asked his supporters to vote for Boisclair on the second ballot.\n\nA number of ideas were put forward by the candidates, especially during the official candidates' debates held across Quebec. Amongst others, André Boisclair expounded a debt reduction plan and spoke of free higher education provided by the state. Richard Legendre talked much of more autonomy for Quebec regions. Pauline Marois spoke of water nationalization in an eventual \"Eau-Québec\", like what was created with Hydro-Québec for electricity during the Quiet Revolution. Speaking much about the struggle against poverty, Dubuc, Ouimet and Paquette showed themselves favourable to a guaranteed minimum income system, something that Marois agreed to.\n\nMany candidates declared their intention to put an accent on public transportation and wind power. Lebel was noted for the humour he brought to the debates. However, he was a black sheep of this progressive panel with more conservative ideas. St-André defended the ideas of the \"pur et dur\" party stream, notably that of making \"gestures of rupture\" with the rest of Canada, sovereign state actions before sovereignty and contrary to the Canadian constitution. The strongest consensus between all candidates was that most of these projects were possible through and only through national independence.\n\nThe voting was conducted by phone from November 13 to November 15, 2005 through a system used for popular votes for the Star Académie television show. The winner of the party leadership election was declared on November 15, 2005. The date was chosen in honour of the anniversary of the first electoral victory of the Parti Québécois (November 15, 1976). The election worked under a system of preferential voting in two rounds.\n\nThe seven public debates were orchestrated by election president Lyne Marcoux. They were broadcast live via the Parti Québécois official website, pq.org, and the LCN television news channel. In order to allow substantial and orderly exchanges with such a number of people, every occasion was divided into a series of three discussions, amongst three candidates each. Candidate groupings were set at random. Additionally, for every debate, opening and closing speeches were addressed, and selected questions from the audience and the internet were debated. This selection was executed by an impartial panel led by Monique Richard, the party president.\n\nThe debate on solidarity and public finances took place on September 21, 2005 in Sherbrooke. On solidarity, the project of a guaranteed minimum income gathered Dubuc, Marois, Paquette and Ouimet. Boisclair said himself open to a debate on free higher education covered by the state and declared education his priority. He presented a public debt reduction plan. A fierce confrontation occurred between St-André and Boisclair when the former repeatedly challenged the latter to engage himself in fighting corporate tax evasion, which he finally did. Boisclair also defended the Zero Deficit policy of the previous Parti Québécois government of Lucien Bouchard, of which Boisclair was part.\n\nThe debate on sustainable development and economy took place on September 28, 2005 in Montreal. Most candidates communicated their intent on putting an accent on public transportation and wind power. Marois again spoke of water nationalization in an eventual \"Eau-Québec\". Richard Legendre sparked a feud with Boisclair about the latter's alleged slowness to trigger a referendum (Boisclair speaks of a referendum launched \"as soon as possible during the next mandate\", as stipulates the new party platform, adopted at the Party National Council of 2005, while Legendre advocates one within the first year in power). Legendre also criticized the way Boisclair adopted his moratorium on pigsties while being Minister of the Environment.\n\nThe debate on culture took place on October 12, 2005 in Trois-Rivières. Ouimet underlined that making sure artists never fall into the poverty gap is the way to have a healthy culture in Quebec. A discussion on the Charter of the French Language took place.\n\nThe debate on sovereignty and leadership took place on October 19, 2005 in Quebec City. Since the method and haste to attain independence is often a burning subject in the party, the media projected it as the most tumultuous of the seven. According to them, it ended up being the calmest.\n\nThe debate on territory took place on October 26, 2005 in Rimouski.\n\nThe debate on education took place on November 2, 2005 in Saguenay.\n\nThe debate on health took place on November 9, 2005 in Gatineau.\n\nCandidates listed have collected at least 1000 signatures from 40 different ridings, with a minimum of 10 signatures per riding. By order of official candidacy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Minister André Boisclair was elected leader of the Parti Québécois at the first round ballot. The turnout was around 76% of party members.\n<nowiki>*: </nowiki>Gilbert Paquette withdrew and asked his supporters to vote for Pauline Marois on November 10, 2005.\nThe results are shown as announced by election officials on PQ website.\n\n\n\n"}

The film stars Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar and Priyanka Chopra, the second collaboration of Kumar and Chopra after their successful \"Andaaz\" (2003). The supporting cast includes Amrish Puri, Kader Khan, Satish Shah and Rajpal Yadav, with several Indian cricket team players in cameo appearances.\n\nSet primarily in Goa, two men (Kumar and Khan) try to win a woman's (Chopra) heart. Wanting to re-invent himself, Dhawan decided to make a film which would deviate from his signature \"mass-market\" comedies in look and feel, approaching it as a romantic comedy. The screenplay was written by Dhawan's longtime collaborator Anees Bazmee and Rumi Jaffery. The movie's certain gag elements are inspired from the 2000 American Comedy film Meet the Parents.\n\nAlthough the film is set in Goa, it was not shot there. Instead principal photography was done on two detailed sets created by Sharmishta Roy in Film City and Mauritius. Additionally, several scenes and songs were filmed on-location in Mauritius. \"Mujhse Shaadi Karogi\" was released on 30 July 2004 to positive reviews, receiving praise for its direction, performances, music, cinematography, art direction, costumes and styling. With a box-office gross of 565 million, the film was a major commercial success, becoming the third-highest-grossing Indian film of the year.\n\n\"Mujhse Shaadi Karogi\" was nominated for three Filmfare Awards. The film received thirteen nominations at the 2005 IIFA Awards, including Best Film, Best Director (Dhawan), Best Actor (Khan) and Best Actress (Chopra), winning five awards. It received ten Screen Awards nominations, including Best Film.\n\nSameer Malhotra is ill-tempered, with anger-management issues since his parents died during his childhood. When he beats up a group of goons who tried to assault his girlfriend Roma, she breaks up with him because of his temper. According to his horoscope, Sameer is unlucky in love. To escape further similar issues, he becomes a lifeguard in Goa.\n\nOn the train, Sameer meets Suraj Prakash, a passenger who makes him think that he is a thief by asking him where he keeps important things (like money) in his luggage. Sameer stays awake all night to avoid being robbed, while Suraj sleeps after conning Sameer into guarding his luggage. Suraj admits this to Sameer the next morning at the station. Sameer learns that Suraj is a security guard at his resort, and puts him on night guard duty for three months. This puts a crimp in Suraj's marriage and, although he apologises, Sameer is adamant.\n\nSameer meets Rani, an up-and-coming fashion designer, and falls in love with her. After a rough start with her father Jugraj Singh, a former colonel, Rani and Sameer become friends. Sameer's bad luck comes into play; he disagrees with Singh, and Rani becomes angry with him when she overhears him saying bad things about her to Pandit Raj Purohit Jyotshi.\n\nTrouble arrives in the form of Sunny, who shares a room with Sameer. He meets Rani, falls in love with her and decides to capitalise on Sameer's mistakes. This causes friction between the roommates. Sameer gives Rani the money she needs for a fashion competition, calling himself her \"well-wisher\". Rani wins the competition and wants to thank her \"well-wisher\" in person. Sameer (who gave Rani the money he had saved for his grandmother's eye surgery and his sister's wedding) goes to meet her but Sunny gets there first, claims to be the well-wisher and takes her away. Sameer follows on his motorcycle and accidentally injures Singh. Sunny, who takes credit for a painting of Rani by Sameer, kidnaps her dog Tommy and frames Sameer. Sameer buys an identical dog and tells Singh that he has found Tommy. He is unmasked when the dog bites Singh and runs away.\n\nAlthough Sameer is angry, he reconciles with Rani with the help of a magician at a New Year's Eve party. Sunny places a bar dancer in Sameer's room one morning; Rani, who went there to invite him for breakfast, sees the dancer sleeping there and assumes that they had sex.\n\nSameer makes another attempt to apologise. When he goes to Rani's house, he is surprised to see Suraj; Suraj is Rani's uncle, who now knows that he loves her. Sameer apologises and takes Suraj off night duty. Sameer's partially-blind grandmother mistakes Rani's mother for Rani and tries to persuade her to marry Sameer. Rani's mother tells her daughter to carefully consider whom she loves more: Sameer or Sunny.\n\nSameer decides to leave Goa, and Sunny taunts him that he got close to Rani through Sameer's mistakes. Sameer says that he has had enough dreaming, and wishes Sunny happiness. Sunny taunts Sameer again, and Sameer loses his temper. He chases Sunny through the crowd at a cricket stadium where India and Pakistan are playing a friendly match. Sameer breaks through security, takes the microphone from the guest of honour Kapil Dev and apologises to Rani and her parents. He asks her to marry him in front of the crowd, and Rani runs onto the field and embraces him, thus reuniting with him.\n\nSunny reveals that he is Arun, Sameer's childhood friend who came to Goa to cure Sameer's anger-management issues. He also reveals that he went to visit Sameer after returning from America after 19 years and met Sameer's grandmother, who told him about Sameer's heartbreak and departure for Goa. Arun decided to help Sameer by posing as his enemy, telling Rani and her parents earlier. Sameer is reunited with Arun, who conducts his and Rani's wedding.\n\nCredits adapted from Bollywood Hungama:\n\nCricketers made cameo appearances as themselves:\n\nKnown primarily for mass-market comedies, David Dhawan wanted to make \"Mujhse Shaadi Karogi\" a romantic comedy. Asked about re-inventing himself with the film, he replied: \"I have changed with the times. One has to [change]. My trademark style remains unchanged in its basics. Why should I change when my style has kept me going for so many years? I will never change that.\" Dhawan wanted the make the film different from his earlier releases in look and feel. Anees Bazmee, who collaborated on several films with the director, returned to write its screenplay.\n\nIn a \"Times of India\" interview, Priyanka Chopra said that she had signed for Dhawan's comedy film co-starring Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar; it was the second collaboration between Kumar and Chopra, after the successful \"Andaaz\" (2003). Chopra said that her decision was based on \"the hilarious script\" and Sajid Nadiadwala's reputation as a producer. She described Rani, an aspiring fashion designer, as \"very innocent and gullible\" and a \"girl next door\": \"Rani gets stuck between two boys. She likes both of them and she doesn't know what to do.\" In an interview with Rediff.com, Kumar described his character as someone who creates many problems in Sameer's life and compared their dynamics to \"Tom and Jerry\": \"I harass him all the time.\"\n\nPrincipal photography began in September 2003 on a set in Film City, Mumbai. Art director Sharmishta Roy created a detailed set of Goa; according to \"Hindustan Times\", \"The set had become the talk of the industry for its fine detailing.\" Roy built another large set in Mauritius, where the outdoor scenes, the songs and several other scenes were filmed on a month-long schedule beginning on 9 January 2004. Three hundred people made up the unit for the Mauritius schedule.\n\nAn action scene was filmed with a motion-control camera, a first in Indian cinema. Although the producers wanted to keep the film's climax (featuring several cricketers from the Indian team and filmed at a Bangalore stadium in June 2004) a secret, it was revealed in the media. Filming wrapped in July 2004.\n\nThe soundtrack album contains eight songs, seven original songs and one remix. Six songs were composed by Sajid-Wajid and the seventh by Anu Malik. Lyrics for five songs were written by Jalees Sherwani, with one song each by Sameer and Arun Bhairav. The vocals were performed by Udit Narayan, Alka Yagnik, Sonu Nigam, Sunidhi Chauhan, Sukhwinder Singh and Shabab Sabri. With a background score composed by Salim-Sulaiman, the album was released on 4 June 2004.\n\nIt was generally well-received by music critics, who praised the album's lyrics and vocals. Planet Bollywood rated the soundtrack seven out of ten, calling it a \"good album\". Bollywood Hungama praised its songs and musical score, highlighting \"Rab Kare\", \"Jeene Ke Hain Chaar Din\", \"Laal Dupatta\" and the title song.\n\nThe music topped charts on a number of platforms in India. The soundtrack was one of the best-selling Bollywood soundtracks of the year, with 2 million units sold according to Box Office India.\n\nEntrances of several theaters in India and abroad were decorated as marriage \"mandaps\" (halls) for the film. Sajid Nadiadwala said, \"You have to make the entire process of movie-going exciting. Since the title itself talks of marriage, making the entrance of theatres resemble mandaps was the best possible way to attract cinegoers.\"\n\nThe producers sponsored several contests as part of \"Mujhse Shaadi Karogi\" marketing campaign, with prizes including a foreign honeymoon trip and wedding clothing by Biba and Neeta Lulla. They released a 64-page, palm-sized book with information about the characters' love triangle, tips about how to woo a woman and pictures of the three main characters. The film was released on 30 July 2004. Zee TV brought its UK distribution rights, the first film distributed by the channel.\n\n\"Mujhse Shaadi Karogi\" opened well throughout India, despite poor weather, and did very good business in its theatrical run. The film also opened well in the overseas market, ranking eighth at the UK box office over its first weekend. After a good first week it prevailed over its second weekend, earning 35.4 million from 32 screens in the United Kingdom and 32.9 million from 48 screens in the United States. \"Mujhse Shaadi Karogi\" was a major commercial success, earning 565 million at the box office and thus becoming the third-highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year.\n\n\"Mujhse Shaadi Karogi\" was released on DVD on 27 September 2004 in all regions on a single NTSC-format disc. Distributed by T-Series, the DVD included deleted scenes, extra songs, a theatrical trailer and TV advertisements. The film's Video CD was released at the same time. A Blu-ray disc was released on 10 July 2010.\n\n\"Mujhse Shaadi Karogi\" was well-received by critics, who praised the film's direction, cinematography, choreography, costumes, styling and performances. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave it four stars out of five, calling it a \"mass entertainer\" and an apt example of escapist cinema which \"transports you to a world of make-believe\". Adarsh praised the chemistry between Khan, Kumar and Chopra and wrote, \"Stylishly shot at some panoramic locales of Mauritius, with no double entendres, the film proves yet again that only David can pull off such stories without the cinegoer feeling cheated by an obscure plot.\"\n\nSubhash K. Jha gave \"Mujhse Shaadi Karogi\" a positive review for Indo-Asian News Service, calling the film Dhawan's smartest comedy to date: \"This is one laughathon you can enjoy with your family without squirming in your seats.\" Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com also praised the film: \"It's a screwball comedy with gorgeous visuals, crisp editing, and fine performances. David Dhawan gets it right.\" A review in \"The Hindu\" called it \"pure entertainment\" and praised the clean humour and Kumar's performance writing that \"Salman Khan shows more brawn than histrionics, while Akshay Kumar displays a real flair for comedy.

{"id": "2038181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038181", "title": "Tom's Midnight Garden", "text": "Tom's Midnight Garden\n\nTom's Midnight Garden is a children's fantasy novel by Philippa Pearce. It was first published in 1958 by Oxford with illustrations by Susan Einzig. It has been reissued in print many times and also adapted for radio, television, the cinema, and the stage. Pearce won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's outstanding children's book by a British subject. In 2007, for the 70th anniversary celebration of the award, a panel named it one of the top ten Medal-winning works and the British public elected it the nation's second-favourite.\n\nTom is a modern boy living under quarantine with his aunt and uncle in a city flat, part of a converted building that was a country house during the 1880s–1890s. At night he slips back in time to the old garden where he finds a girl playmate, called Hatty. Hatty is a princess or so she says.\n\nWhen Tom Long's brother Peter gets measles, Tom is sent to stay with his Uncle Alan and Aunt Gwen. They live in an upstairs flat of a big house with no garden, only a tiny yard for parking. The former grounds of the big house have been sold for building and are occupied by modern houses. The elderly and reclusive landlady, Mrs Bartholomew, lives above them. Because Tom may be infectious, he is not allowed out to play, and he feels lonely. Without exercise he lies awake after midnight, restless, when he hears the communal grandfather clock strangely strike 13. He gets up to investigate and discovers that the back door now opens on a large sunlit garden.\n\nEvery night the clock strikes 13 and Tom returns to the Victorian era grounds. There he meets another lonely child, a girl called Hatty, and they become inseparable playmates. Tom sees the family occasionally, but only Hatty (and as is revealed later in the book, the gardener) sees him and the others believe she plays alone.\n\nTom writes daily accounts to his brother Peter, who follows the adventures during his recovery – and afterward, for Tom contrives to extend the stay with Aunt and Uncle. Gradually at first, Hatty grows up and passes Tom's age; he comes to realise that he is slipping to different points in the past. Finally she grows up at a faster rate, until she is an adult and is courting an acquaintance of hers, Barty. At this stage in the book, the season in the old garden tends to be winter. Tom ingeniously obtains ice skates by having Hatty conceal her old pair in his room, where he subsequently finds them and joins her skating on the next night.\n\nOn the final night before Tom is due to go home, he goes downstairs to find the garden is not there. He desperately tries to run around and find it, but crashes into a set of bins from the present–day courtyard, waking up several residents. He shouts Hatty's name in disappointment, before his Uncle Alan finds him and puts the events down to Tom sleepwalking. The following morning, Mrs Bartholomew summons Tom to apologise, only to reveal herself as Hatty, having made the link when she heard him call her name. The events Tom experienced were real in Hatty's past; he has stepped into them by going into the garden at the times she dreamt of them. On the final night, she had instead been dreaming of her wedding with Barty.\n\nAfter taking Tom home, Aunt Gwen comments on the strange way that Tom had said goodbye to Mrs Bartholomew when he left: he hugged her, as if she were a little girl.\n\nThe book is regarded as a classic but it also has overtones that permeate other areas of Pearce's work. We remain in doubt for a while as to who is the ghost, there are questions over the nature of time and reality and we end by believing that the midnight garden is a projection from the mind of an old lady. These time/space questions occur in other books by Pearce, especially those dealing with ghosts. The final reconciliation between Tom, still a child, and the elderly Hatty is, many have argued, one of the most moving moments in children's fiction.\n\nIn \"Written for Children\" (1965), John Rowe Townsend summarised, \"If I were asked to name a single masterpiece of English children's literature since [the Second World War] ... it would be this outstandingly beautiful and absorbing book\". He retained that judgment in the second edition of that magnum opus (1983) and in 2011 repeated it, in a retrospective review of the novel.\n\nIn the first chapter of \"Narratives of Love and Loss: Studies in Modern Children's Fiction\", Margaret and Michael Rustin analyse the emotional resonances of \"Tom's Midnight Garden\" and describe its use of imagination and metaphor, also comparing it to \"The Secret Garden\" by Frances Hodgson Burnett.\n\nResearcher Ward Bradley, in his review of various modern stories and books depicting Victorian British society, criticized \"Midnight Garden\" for \"romanticizing the world of the 19th-century aristocratic mansions, making it a glittering 'lost paradise' contrasted with the drab reality of contemporary lower middle class Britain.(...) A child deriving an image of Victorian England from this engaging and well-written fairy tale would get no idea of the crushing poverty in the factories and slums from where mansion owners often derived their wealth\".\n\nTime slip became a popular device in British children's novels in that period. Other successful examples include Alison Uttley's \"A Traveller in Time\" (1939, slipping back to the period of Mary, Queen of Scots), Ronald Welch's \"The Gauntlet\" (1951, slipping back to the Welsh Marches in the fourteenth century), Barbara Sleigh's \"Jessamy\" (1967, back to the First World War), and \"Charlotte Sometimes\" by Penelope Farmer (1969, back to 1918).\n\nThe historical part of the book is set in the grounds of a mansion, which resembles the house in which the author grew up: the Mill House in Great Shelford, near Cambridge, England. Cambridge is represented in fictional form as Castleford throughout the book. At the time she was writing the book, the author was again living in Great Shelford, just across the road from the Mill House. The Kitsons' house is thought to be based on a house in Cambridge, near where Pearce studied during her time at university. The theory of time of which the novel makes use is that of J. W. Dunne's influential 1927 work \"An Experiment with Time\".\n\n\n\nSince 1936, the professional association of British librarians has recognised the year's best new book for children with the Carnegie Medal. Philippa Pearce and \"Tom\" won the 1958 Medal. For the 70th anniversary celebration in 2007, a panel of experts appointed by the children's librarians named \"Tom's Midnight Garden\" one of the top ten Medal-winning works, which composed the ballot for a public election of the nation's favourite. It finished second in the public vote from that shortlist, between two books that were about forty years younger. Among votes cast from the UK, \"Northern Lights\" polled 40%, \"Tom's Midnight Garden\" 16%; \"Skellig\" 8%. The winning author, Philip Pullman, graciously said: \"Personally I feel they got the initials right but not the name. I don't know if the result would be the same in a hundred years' time; maybe Philippa Pearce would win then.\" Julia Eccleshare, Children's Books Editor for \"The Guardian\" newspaper, continued the theme: \"\"Northern Lights\" is the right book by the right author. Philip is accurate in saying that the only contention was from the other PP. And, it must be said, \"Tom's Midnight Garden\" has lasted almost 60 years ... and we don't know that \"Northern Lights\" will do the same. But, yes. A very good winner.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2038197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038197", "title": "Nathan Witt", "text": "Nathan Witt\n\nNathan Witt (February 11, 1903 – February 16, 1982), born Nathan Wittowsky, was an American lawyer who is best known as being the Secretary of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) from 1937 to 1940. He resigned from the NLRB after his communist political beliefs were exposed and he was accused of manipulating the Board's policies to favor his own political leanings. He was also investigated several times in the late 1940s and 1950s for being a spy for the Soviet Union in the 1930s. No evidence of espionage was ever found.\n\nNathan R. Witt was born February 11, 1903, into a Jewish family on the Lower East Side of New York City. His father changed the family name to Witt shortly after his birth. His college education was interrupted several times by the need to earn a living: he drove a taxi cab. In 1927, he graduated from New York University (NYU). It was at NYU (then \"Washington Square College\") that he met Lee Pressman.\n\nAngered by what he perceived as the judicial mistreatment and illegal execution of the anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti in 1927, he drove a taxi cab for two years to earn money for law school. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1932, or 1933, specializing in labor law. He attended Harvard shortly after Alger Hiss had left the school, and he was a friend of Donald Hiss, a Harvard Law classmate and Alger Hiss's younger brother.\n\nWitt joined the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) in July 1933. His friend, Lee Pressman, recommended him for the job. According to accusers Whittaker Chambers, Lee Pressman, and Elizabeth Bentley, Witt—along with John Abt, Charles Kramer, Alger Hiss, and Nathaniel Weyl, among others—were part of the so-called \"Ware group,\" a clandestine Communist Party USA group formed by AAA economist Harold Ware. Chambers also alleged that Witt became leader of the group after Ware died in an automobile accident in August 1935. Pressman said the men merely met to study and discuss left-wing political theory, but Chambers described it as a Soviet-controlled cell dedicated to committing espionage. Historian David M. Kennedy, assessing a half-century's evidence about the case, concurred with Pressman's assessment in 2001.\n\nThere is widespread disagreement as to whether Witt was actually a Communist Party member or not. Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. observed that Chambers never provided evidence of Witt's party membership, just uncorroborated accusation. Labor historian Leon Fink agrees. Labor historian Nelson Lichtenstein, however, concluded that Witt \"probably\" was both a member of the Communist Party and held communist ideals, but historian Ronald Schatz has asserted that Witt's communist sympathies did \"not necessarily\" mean Party membership.\n\nWitt never hid his communism and made it well known to others from his earliest days in the government. Chambers told Adolf A. Berle, then Assistant Secretary of State, about Witt's involvement in the \"Ware group\" in 1939. Berle later said that \"to be blunt about it, Mr. Witt's statements and sympathies were so well known that what Mr. Chambers had said added nothing to anything that wasn't public knowledge at the time.\" William S. Leiserson, an NLRB Board member, knew Witt held communist beliefs almost from the first days after Leiserson joined the Board. There is general agreement among professional historians that Witt's communist views did not affect his work and did not change the outcome of any policy choices made by government agencies.\n\nWitt joined the legal staff of the \"first\" National Labor Relations Board in February 1934. The National Labor Relations Act became law in June 1935, creating the \"second\" (permanent) NLRB. Witt was named the NLRB's assistant chief counsel (\"assistant general counsel\") in December 1935. He exerted a great deal of influence in the Review Section, the division of the NLRB which reviewed transcripts of NLRB hearings in labor disputes, revised transcripts to emphasize points of law, reviewed draft decisions of examiners for adherence to NLRB policy and law, and made oral reports to the three members of the Board. He chose (with the approval of the Board) the attorneys who staffed the Review Section, assigned cases to attorneys, and checked the drafts of Board decisions for technical accuracy. Witt recommended Pressman for a job as a trial examiner at the NLRB in 1936.\n\nWitt was named Secretary (the highest non-appointed bureaucratic office—or \"the top administrative officer\") of the Board in October (or November) 1937. The enormous workload and tremendous expansion in the number of personnel at the NLRB made Witt the agency's most powerful individual. He attended Board meetings, took Board minutes, prepared and served Board decisions ordering union organizing elections, granted and denied requests for oral testimony from employers, oversaw each Board member's appointments and administered the office and oversaw the staff of 250. He was the Board's chief liaison to Congress and oversaw preparation and submission of the Board's budget. He was the sole supervisor of the Board's 22 regional offices, overseeing the roughly 225 personnel in the field. He alone exercised the authority to authorize a hearing in the case of unfair labor practice (ULP) or election cases, and he alone reported on these cases (in oral, not written) fashion to the Board. Almost all correspondence, telephone contact, and telegraph contact between the regional offices and the Board passed through his office first, and his office collected nearly all the information coming in from the field regarding elections, ULPs, settlements, strikes, enforcement issues, informational inquiries, and the development of new policies.\n\nWitt's communism was the cause of much dispute within the NLRB and eventually led to his resignation as Board Secretary. The NLRB was under intense legal, media, congressional, and public criticism in 1938 and 1939 for what many people saw as overreaching. \nIn July 1939, the House of Representatives created the Special Committee to Investigate the National Labor Relations Board (popularly known as the \"Smith Committee\" after its chairman, conservative Democratic Rep. Howard W. Smith--a \"powerful, arch-segregationist and anti-Communist\".) to investigate the NLRB. The Smith Committee received testimony from hundreds of witnesses, conducted a nationwide survey regarding the impact of the NLRB, and questioned NLRB officials at length about the agency's alleged anti-business and anti-American Federation of Labor/pro-Congress of Industrial Organizations biases. \n\nFrom December 1939 to February 1940, the committee \"probed Witt's handling of labor cases, strikes, and controversies.\" The committee weakened Witt in its accusation that he \"hewed\" to the Communist Party line. In response, Witt wrote to the committee that \"I am not now, nor have I ever been, a member of the Communist Party, a 'Communist sympathizer,' or one who 'hews to the Communist Party line'.\"\n\nIn December 1939, Board Member Leiserson testified that he believed Witt held too much power at the NLRB, that Witt had influenced the NLRB's decisions in favor of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), and that Witt's far-left views were unacceptable. Leiserson testified that he had repeatedly voiced his concerns to Board Chairman J. Warren Madden, but that Madden and Board member Edwin S. Smith had allied to prevent any attempt to rein in or fire Witt. Later testimony revealed that an internal NLRB study had backed Leiseron and that Madden and Smith had suppressed it, and that Witt had assisted Madden in secretly building public and expert support for the NLRB (expending federal funds in lobbying against Congress). Madden attempted to defend Witt. \n\nBy September 1940, the Smith Committee was accusing other NLRB employees, such as chief economist David J. Saposs, of harboring communist ideas. It was clear that neither Madden nor Witt could continue at the NLRB much longer. President Franklin D. Roosevelt named University of Chicago economics professor Harry A. Millis to be the new chairman of the NLRB in November 1940, after Madden's term on the Board expired in August. \n\nWitt resigned from the NLRB on November 18, 1940, although his resignation was not accepted until after Millis was sworn in on November 27. He ended his work at the Board on December 10. Later that month, Witt joined Board member Edwin S. Smith, former Board associate general counsel Thomas I. Emerson, and four other NLRB attorneys in denying Smith Committee testimony that they were members of the Communist Party or had followed the CPUSA line in their work.\n\nIn 1941, after leaving the NLRB, Witt joined with Harold I. Cammer (founder of the National Lawyers Guild) to form a law partnership of Witt & Cammer in New York City. (On November 24, 1947, the address for \"Witt & Cammer, Esqs.\" was 9 East 40th Street, New York, NY.) New clients for Witt & Cammer included the CIO (in New York), other labor organizations, and left-wing unions like the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers (known as \"Mine-Mill\"). In 1941, Witt represented the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (or SWOC, later, the United Steel Workers of America).\n\nMeantime, Pressman, remained as chief legal counsel of the CIO itself as well as the SWOC, both of which he had joined in the late 1930s, as Witt was joining and rising in the NRLB. In February 1948, Pressman left the CIO to create the private law practice of Pressman, Witt & Cammer. The firm became one of the most prominent left-wing labor law firms in the country. (Bella Abzug started her career at Pressman, Witt & Cammer.)\n\nIn early 1948, Witt's clients included the Greater New York CIO Council. As their counsel, he spoke to the press over allegations that FBI investigators were intimidating local CIO offices. \"There could not possibly be any technical violation in 1948 except for the Isacson election and the FBI agents made clear they were not investigating that.\"\n\nAlso in early 1948, Witt was working with fellow National Lawyers Guild member Joseph Forer of Washington, DC. In January 26–28 and February 2, 1948, a hearing of the House Education and Labor Subcommittee, chaired by U.S. Representative Clare E. Hoffman, occurred on the topic of a strike by United Cafeteria and Restaurant Workers (Local 471) and its parent, the United Public Workers of America (UPWA), CIO, against Government Services, Inc. (GSI), which had already lasted nearly a month. UPWA was a client of Forer & Rein. Hoffman refused to let UPWA head Abram Flaxer read a statement and asked questions including whether Flaxer was a communist. Witt, one of his UAW attorneys, objected to \"abuse of congressional power.\" On January 26, 1948, UPWA negotiations director Alfred Bernstein (father of Carl Bernstein), charged that House committee agents had raided the union's offices. During January, William S. Tyson, solicitor for the Labor Department, and Robert N. Denham, general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board, both agreed that nothing in the Taft-Hartley Act prohibited GSI from bargaining with a non-complying union. However, Denham added, the Act intended to \"eliminate Communist influence from unions by denying to such unions the services of NLRB.\"\n\nIn 1950, Witt and partner Cammer defended the New York City Teachers Union (their client) against accusations from William Jansen, superintendent of New York City schools.\n\nIn 1950, the U.S. State Department revoked singer and civil rights activist Paul Robeson's passport as a means of preventing him from traveling overseas and continuing his left-wing political work. Witt and Abt were among Robeson's first attorney and initiated Robeson's eight-year battle to regain his passport.\n\nIn 1955, he left the firm to become legal counsel to the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers. When the union merged with and became a division of the United Steel Workers in the 1960s, Witt was retained as associate counsel for the new division.\n\nWitt was involved in numerous labor union disputes and labor-related free speech cases in the 1940s and 1950s. He represented members of the College Teachers Union (a predecessor to the modern Professional Staff Congress union at the City College of New York) when they were accused in 1941 of being communists by the Rapp-Coudert Committee. He briefly served as legal counsel to the International Fur & Leather Workers Union in 1944 in a major due process case. He was the lead attorney for the Seamen's Joint Action Committee, a CIO-backed insurgent group which allied with three CIO longshoremen's unions to challenge International Longshoremen's Association president Joseph Ryan. He also represented several members of the Teachers Union accused of being communists in 1950 and 1952. (At the time, the Teachers Union was a local union representing New York City public schools teachers. It had been ejected by the American Federation of Teachers for being communist-controlled, and in the 1950s, it was part of the United Public Workers of America. It would later rejoin the American Federation of Teachers in the early 1960s and merge with another local to become the United Federation of Teachers.)\n\nIn 1975, Witt retired as associate counsel for the miners' division of the United Steel Workers.\n\nOn August 3, 1948, in testimony to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), Whittaker Chambers named Witt as a member (and even leader) of the \"Ware Group.\" When called before a one-man subcommittee of HUAC (whose sole member was Representative Richard Nixon) on August 20, Witt denied knowing \"J. Peters\" (ostensibly the head of the Soviet Union's political operations in the United States), Chambers, or Alger Hiss. Along with Abt and Pressman (with Cammer as legal counsel for all three), Witt invoked First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendment rights when refusing to answer HUAC questions. Lee Pressman, also testifying that day, forced the subcommittee to admit that it was not accusing the men of espionage but rather being communists seeking to infiltrate the government (which was not a crime). A few weeks later, former \"Daily Worker\" editor turned anti-communist Louis F. Budenz testified that the CPUSA considered Witt a member. Federal law enforcement officials debated prosecuting Witt in late 1948—not for being a communist, a spy, or for committing espionage, but under a contempt of Congress charge for asserting his Fifth Amendment rights before the committee and refusing to answer its questions. No prosecution was ever made. Having refused to answer questions before Congress, \"Witt understood that the public saw that as tantamount to admitting guilt\" to Communist activities.\n\nWitt later testified in February 1949 before a federal grand jury investigating illegal CPUSA activities in the United States.\n\nTestifying again before HUAC in 1950, Lee Pressman named Witt as a member of the CPUSA and the \"Ware group.\" Speaking before a HUAC subcommittee on September 1, Witt once more denied that he had engaged in espionage, again invoked his Fifth Amendment privileges when asked about his CPUSA and \"Ware group\" membership, and refused to say whether he knew Chambers, Bentley, or scores of others.\n\nIn February 1952, writer Nathaniel Weyl named Witt as a \"Ware group\" member before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security.\nIn 1952 and 1953, the McCarran Committee called Witt back to Congress. Harvey Matusow, former CPUSA member, had previously testified before Congress against his former comrades. However, in 1954, Matusow published a book, \"False Witness\", in which he recanted his anti-communist testimony. In April 1955, the Subcommittee on Internal Security learned that Witt had obtained a cash donation from the Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers Union to help Matusow get his book published. Witt was called before the Subcommittee on Internal Security on April 18 to testify about his involvement in the Matusow affair. Witt freely admitted his legal role in obtaining the publication fee. Witt last appeared before Congress in 1955, eventually totaling six times, several times with Clinton Jencks from his client, the Mine-Mill union.\n\nSenator James O. Eastland, subcommittee chair, then implied there was something suspicious about Witt's real name being Wittowsky. Witt engaged in a shouting match with Eastland, accusing the senator of antisemitism. Witt denied he had anything to hide. Eastland demanded to know about his membership in the CPUSA and the \"Ware group,\" and Witt invoked his Fifth Amendment rights again. When a subcommittee member asked Witt if he had sent white lilies to Chambers (implying that this constituted a death threat), Witt categorically denied doing so.\n\nOn June 19, 1930, Nathan Witt married Anna Laura Phillips. They had two children, Hal (circa 1937) and Leda (1939). (Hal Witt later worked with Joseph Forer in the 1960s on the Giles-Johnson case in defending the Giles brothers and in the Supreme Court \"Giles v. Maryland\".)\n\nNathan R. Witt died age 79 on February 16, 1982, at Rockefeller University Hospital in New York City.\n\nIn 1949, Edward R. Murrow had CBS News colleague Don Hollenbeck contribute to the innovative media-review program, \"CBS Views the Press\" over the radio network's flagship station WCBS. Hollenbeck discussed Edward U. Condon, Alger Hiss, and Paul Robeson. Regarding Hiss (during which case, as Loren Ghiglione has noted \"Hollenbeck and his coverage of the reporting of the Hiss-Chambers case did not take sides on Hiss's guilt or innocence\" ), Hollenbeck criticized press coverage. For instance, he noted how a \"New York Journal-American\" story led a story stating \"The government ended its cross-examination of Alger Hiss at 3:01 p.m. today after forcing him to admit he was an associate of Mrs. Carol King, prominent legal defender of Communists, and a friend of Nathan Witt, ex-New Deal lawyer who was fired because of his Communist activities.\" Hollenbeck noted that the transcript differed greatly, in that Hiss had said: he had met King \"once or twice,\" while his description of when and where he met Witt even less clear. He also noted the guilt by association tactics of fellow journalists, for example, Westbrook Pegler, who sought to discredit Eleanor Roosevelt through link to Hiss via Felix Frankfurter.\nIn 1977 during an interview, David A. Morse (1907–1990), recounted that in 1949, shortly after he had finished work as NRLB general counsel and become a US delegate to the International Labor Conference of the International Labour Organization (ILO): \n\n\n\n"}

The temple was built in 1785 and forms part of the Downhill Demesne. The demesne was formerly part of the estate of Frederick, 4th Earl of Bristol, who served as the Church of Ireland Lord Bishop of Derry from 1768 until 1803. It was Lord Bristol – popularly known as \"the Earl-Bishop\" – who had the \"temple\" built. Constructed as a library and modelled from the Temple of Vesta in the \"Forum Romanum\" in Rome, it is dedicated to the memory of Bishop Lord Bristol's cousin Frideswide Mussenden.\n\nOver the years the erosion of the cliff face at Downhill has brought Mussenden Temple ever closer to the edge, and in 1997 The National Trust carried out cliff stabilisation work to prevent the loss of the building.\n\nThe inscription around the building reads:\n\n\"\"Suave, mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis <br>\n\"e terra magnum alterius spectare laborem.\"\" <br>\n\"Tis pleasant, safely to behold from shore <br>\nThe troubled sailor, and hear the tempests roar.\" \n\nThe quotation is from Lucretius, \"De Rerum Natura\", 2.1–2.\n\nNamed in honour of his cousin Mrs. Frideswide Mussenden, whose beauty he greatly admired, this was the Bishop's library. Its walls were once lined with bookcases. A fire was kept burning constantly in the basement. This and its enclosed flue meant that, even in this very exposed location, the books never got damp.\n\n\"I intend to build a Grecian temple in Frideswide's honour...I intend to build it on the edge of a cliff. It will give employment to the poor, to the district and employment.\" The Earl Bishop was clearly heart broken when Frideswide died. His notes on the building state that it was based on Bramante's Tempietto on Rome's Janiculum hill, which itself based on the Temple of Vesta at Tivoli near Rome. The building was probably the work of Micheal Shanahan who accompanied the Earl Bishop on one of his many visits to Italy.\n\nNow part of The National Trust property of Mussenden Temple and Downhill Demesne, the grounds encompassing Mussenden Temple, and its manor house (Downhill Castle) are open to the public all year, from dawn to dusk. The \"Temple\" offers views westwards over Downhill Strand towards Magilligan Point and on across to Inishowen in County Donegal; and to the east, Castlerock beach towards Portstewart, Portrush and Fair Head.\n\nThe temple obtained a licence to hold civil wedding ceremonies in 2007.\n\nThe nearest station is Castlerock railway station.\n\n"}

Parque del Este, the biggest urban park in Caracas, although largely in neighboring Sucre territory, has one of its main entrances in Chacao, making it a popular recreational and exercise area for the inhabitants of Los Palos Grandes and other Chacao neighborhoods.\n\nThe municipality has become a financial center after many of the country's banks moved their headquarters to the formerly residential neighborhood of El Rosal. The main street artery, Francisco de Miranda avenue and its vicinity, rivals Caracas' old downtown in office space availability, and is preferred by foreign companies with established offices in the country. Some signature office buildings include Parque Cristal, Letonia Center, HP Tower, Atlantic Building, La Castellana Center, Multicentro Empresarial del Este, Centro Lido, Centro San Ignacio, KPMG Tower, Forum Tower, Shell Tower, and other important architectural landmarks. Several other office buildings are occupied by government-controlled entities such as the Pequiven and Banco del Tesoro towers.\n\nThe traditional Venezuelan private sector has given way to new short-term businesses and franchises that bloom around the city thanks in part to soaring oil prices. Chacao is again an important player in this money wave craze, with commercial and residential real estate prices among the highest in the nation. The residential neighborhood of Campo Alegre has on average the highest priced real estate in the country.\n\nThe headquarters of Estalar Airlines is in Altamira, Chacao.\n\nThe Cathedral and Bolivar Square area, known as \"Pueblo de Chacao\" was home to Spanish, Italian and Portuguese immigrant waves, and today represents a middle class stronghold in the municipality. Small pockets of poverty, known as \"barrios\", are also present, some of the best known are \"Pajaritos\" and \"El Pedregal\" which are surrounded by luxury condos and opulent houses.\n\nFormer mayor Leopoldo López Mendoza, elected in 2000 and re-elected for the 2004-2008 term, has played a prominent role in anti-Chávez politics over the past eight years. On November 23, 2008, Emilio Graterón was elected mayor with 47,54% of vote. Chacao has represented a stronghold for the Venezuelan opposition. Anti-Chavez votes have steadily represented between 85 and 95% of the total votes in the borough, throughout the length of Chavez's administration.\n\nThe current Ministry of Aquatic and Air Transport has its headquarters in the \"Torre Pequiven\". The Ministry of Transport and Communications previously had its headquarters in the \"Torre MTC\" in Chacao. The \"Junta Investigadora de Accidentes de Aviación Civil\", the Venezuelan aircraft accident investigation agency, had its headquarters in Chacao.\n\nIn Cumanagoto language \"Chakau\" (Chacao) means \"sand\", the municipality was named after the Indian Cacique Chacao, who died defending his territory in 1567, the year when the city of \"Santiago de León de Caracas\" was finally established after more than three decades of unsuccessful attempts by the Spanish. The chosen location for Caracas \"Plaza Mayor\" and Cathedral was on the west side of the valley, making the fertile lands of Chacao (on the mid-east side) an ideal location for agricultural crops and establishment of \"haciendas\". Spanish \"conquistador\" Diego de Losada, founder of the city of Caracas, included these lands in his jurisdiction.\n\nThe township of Chacao was founded by an immigration wave of the \"San Bernabé\" earthquake victims on June 11, 1641. It was officially made a Catholic parish with the foundation of San José de Chacao church.\n\nAfter repeated epidemics and calamities affected Caracas, the Town Hall and the Governor and Commander in chief of the Province, Jose Solano y Bote, in 1764 thought about transferring the entire city to this location, an idea that was rejected by Caracas Bishop Mauro Tovar.\n\nOn April 15, 1769, the residents of Chacao asked for the creation of an independent ecclesiastical parish, Lieutenant Francisco Palacios y Sojo made the request, after evaluating the economic conditions. The final separation of Chacao from the Parish of \"La Candelaria\" was granted on September 27, 1769.\n\n\n"}

Some institutions may record a grade of \"audit\" to those who have elected not to receive a letter grade for a course in which they are typically awarded.\n\nIn this case, 'audit' indicates that the individual merely has received teaching, rather than being evaluated as having achieved a given standard of knowledge of the subject. The term 'audit' is Latin, translating as, 'he/she hears'. In other words, the student has experienced the course, but has not been assessed.\n\nSome students audit a class merely for enjoyment, including purposes of self-enrichment and academic exploration, with no need or desire of academic credit. Sometimes this technique is employed by individuals who wish to take a specific course without the risk of under-performance resulting in a poor or failing grade. This may be helpful when reviewing a long-unstudied subject, or when first beginning or exploring the study of a discipline where one has little experience or confidence.\n\nAuditing is generally an option at institutions of higher learning, such as colleges and universities, rather than grammar school or secondary school.\n\n"}

{"id": "2038227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038227", "title": "Veste Oberhaus", "text": "Veste Oberhaus\n\nVeste Oberhaus is a fortress that was founded in 1219 and, for most of its time, served as the stronghold of the Bishop of Passau, Germany. It is currently the site of a museum, a youth hostel, and a restaurant, as well as an open-air theatre dating to 1934.\n\nThe fortress is located on the mountain crest (St. Georgsberg) on the left side of the Danube between it and the Ilz, and dominates the old city of Passau, which it faces across the Danube. Below Oberhaus on the promontory between the two rivers is \"Veste Niederhaus\", part of the fortress system. \n\nThe fortress was built in 1219 by Ulrich II, the first prince-bishop of Passau, at the location of a previously existing chapel dedicated to St. George. The intention was to express the military strength of the bishopric and support the bishop's status as an elector of the Holy Roman Empire, granted in 1217, and also to protect against both external enemies and internal threats such as those citizens of Passau who wished to acquire the independent status of a free imperial city.\n\nAs siege techniques improved over the centuries, Veste Oberhaus was repeatedly renovated and extended, beginning in 1255–56, so that it offers an opportunity to study fortification techniques from the 13th through the early 19th century. The inscription \"1499\" prominent on the facade refers to one of these renovations. The most significant rebuilding took place under Leonhard von Laiming, Christoph von Schachner, Urban von Trennbach, and Johann Philipp von Lamberg. Under them, the fortress developed from a Gothic citadel to an early Renaissance princely residence, a \"fortified princely castle\", and finally, in the era of invasion by the Turks, a regional fortress and symbol of aristocratic status. Archeological investigations in the 1990s revealed traces of a 17th-century residential tower.\n\nThe fortress was attacked five times between 1250 and 1482, each time without success. Twice, in 1298 and 1367, the attackers were the citizens of Passau themselves in rebellion against the bishop.\n\nBetween 1535 and 1540, numerous Protestant Anabaptists were imprisoned in the castle dungeon for their beliefs. During their imprisonment, the \"Ausbund\" hymnal, still used in Amish religious services, was developed. Some of the hymn writers died while imprisoned; many were martyred.\n\nIn 1704, 1742, and 1800 the fortress was forced to surrender to various forces. Secularization in 1802 brought an end to the rule of the bishop. Napoleon made use of the fortress during his campaign against Austria, placing it under the control of his allies the Bavarians as a border outpost, but in 1805 it surrendered to the Austrian army. After the Congress of Vienna the area was controlled by Bavaria and for almost a century, until 1918, the fortress served an additional purpose as a state and military prison. It was feared as the \"Bastille of Bavaria\". \n\nIn 1932 the City of Passau gained possession of Veste Oberhaus and instituted a museum, the Oberhausmuseum. \n\nThe location of the fortress is the St. Georgsberg mountain, above the valley floor between the Danube and the Ilz. Steep cliffs fall off on both sides. The smaller Veste Niederhaus, connected to Veste Oberhaus by a battlement, is located below on the bank of the Danube; this addition, made after 1367, created a double fortress almost in length. \n\nA road rises to Veste Oberhaus on the Ilz side. On foot, the castle can be reached via the 200 steps of the \"Oberhausleiten-Stiege\" stairway from the Schanzlbrücke Danube bridge. The main gate, the Ravelintor, bears the arms of Cardinal Johann Philipp von Lamberg and was built in 1703. This leads to the \"Kronwerke\", a Baroque bailey constructed in 1674–1740, and a second defensive area dating mostly to the 16th century. From this middle defensive ring, the Burgstraße leads past the main watchtower (built around 1350) and across a drawbridge through a tower built in 1433 to the main fortress. The gate tower at this point bears the arms of Prince Bishop Leonhard von Laiming dated 1440. The buildings encircling the outer courtyard are 16th-century. The church of St. George in the inner courtyard has early and high Gothic frescoes and predates the fortress; it was renovated in Baroque style. The building erected by Christoph von Schachner in 1499–1503 with the highly visible coat of arms and date of 1499 on its facade contains a ceremonial \"Rittersaal\" (knights' hall) on the upper floor; this is connected by an open arcade to the dirnitz and princely suite, which date to the 14th–17th centuries. A cannon battery is housed on the lower story under the Rittersaal.\n\nThe so-called \"Linde Battery\", a terrace within the walls of the Veste Oberhaus, offers a good view of the \"Dreiflüsseeck\" (three rivers corner), the confluence of the Inn, Danube and Ilz; the differing colors of the three rivers are clearly visible from this point.\n\nThe Oberhausmuseum includes the museum of the city of Passau, an art gallery, collections covering the history of Eastern Bavaria, Bohemia, and Austria, a firefighting museum, and a porcelain collection. Today the fortress also houses a restaurant, a viewing platform on the so-called Observation Tower dating to the 18th century, an observatory, and a youth hostel in the so-called General's Building dating to 1597.\n\nIn May 1933, with great fanfare, the \"Ostmarkmuseum\" was opened.\n\nIn April 1934, the former Officers' Garden became an outdoor cafe where many National Socialists were hosted.\n\nThe Baroque-era forward fortifications were replaced by a Thingplatz open-air theatre. In the form of an amphitheater in the approximate form of a quarter circle, this was designed by Ludwig Moshamer and had approximately 6,000 seats and room for approximately 18,000 standees. Ground was broken on August 26, 1934, and the facility was dedicated on September 22, 1935. The inaugural performance was of a work by Hans Baumann honoring \"farmers of the border marches\" and entitled \"Für unsere Treue gibt es keinen Tod\" (for our loyalty there is no death), with a cast of 1,600. \nIn 1937 Eberhard Wolfgang Möller's \"Frankenburger Würfelspiel\" was performed; this concerned an event that happened not far away from Passau, and was to have been repeated annually, but political objections by the Austrians prevented it. In 1938, 85 boys and 162 girls born in 1927 and 1928 were sworn in there as \"Hitler Youth\".\n\nIn July 1940, when \"Rüdiger von Bechelaren\", the latest play by Hans Baumann, was staged, 2,000 Hitler Youth were integrated.\n\nThe theatre since World War II has again been in use.\n\nIn April 1938, Passau unveiled its Guest Suite, where National Socialist dignitaries were hosted. And the regional \"Donauzeitung\" marveled about some features at the Oberhaus George's Chapel. Ancient warrior insignia of the Germanic god \"Wotan\", it stated, had been transferred to that Saint.\n\nIn February 1939, Margarethe Schneider-Reichel called all \"Orts-, Zellen-\", and \"Block-Frauenschaftsleiterinnen\" from the city and the Passau district to a weekend seminar at Veste Oberhaus. There, at the auditorium, they listened to the \"Kreisleiter\" before Dr. Paul Reiß from Mainkofen addressed them for three hours. The central topic were \"necessary measures\" the National Socialist state was taking to control the population.\n\n\n\n"}

The film was a remake of the Telugu film \"Hello Brother\" (1994), which in turn is loosely based on the Jackie Chan film \"Twin Dragons\" (1992). \"Judwaa\" was the first collaboration between Dhawan and Khan.\n\nJayantilal \"Ratan\" (Deepak Shirke) is a dacoit. Inspector SP Malhotra (Dalip Tahil) arrests him. Ratan wounds himself and is taken to the hospital, where Malhotra is waiting for his wife Geeta (Reema Lagoo), who is in labour. She gives birth to twins and the doctor explains that both babies have a reflection mentality, which means that \"what happens with one baby might be felt and reflected by another\" depending on the proximity between them. Ratan escapes and takes one of the twins with him, injuring Geeta. Malhotra goes behind him, but unable to find his son, shoots escaping Ratan to stop him. The kid grows up as Raja (Salman Khan) and finds a girl child, who he adopts as his sister. He finds another orphan, Rangeela (Shakti Kapoor) and becomes his friend. They both together take care of the girl and become thieves. On the other hand, Geeta goes into depression and gets paralysed. Malhotra takes her to the US for her treatment, where the other twin Prem (also Salman Khan) is brought up. He comes to India as a rock star for a show.

Enraged Tiger molests her and Raja fights with him to save his sister. Tiger, again to get his revenge from Raja, sends his henchman named Tommy (Shashi Kiran) as the groom of Neelam, but Raja finds out his plan and marries his sister to somebody else. The court announces the death sentence to Tiger for the murder of Inspector he shot earlier. Days pass, Neelam becomes pregnant and she is admitted to a hospital for her delivery. Raja asks Prem to stay at the hospital as he is going in search of money, Prem visits his father Malhotra. At the same time, Tiger escapes from jail to kidnap Neelam and recognises Malhotra, who shot his father Ratan and finds out that Raja is his son. He blackmails Raja to get him Malhotra to free Neelam. Raja who doesn't know that Malhotra is his father goes to his house where Geeta also comes out from the paralysis by Raja's touch and he comes to know the truth that they are his parents. Finally, Raja and Prem come together to protect their father from Tiger and the story ends with the duo marrying their respective ladies.\n\n\nAccording to Box Office India, the film had an excellent opening in 1997.

It was assigned the NATO reporting name SS-14 Scamp (alternately the SS-14 Scapegoat) and carried the GRAU index 8K96.\n\nThe RT-15 was an early Soviet attempt to develop a road-mobile theatre ballistic missile. It was intended to be capable of being launched from both sea and ground sites and had a maximum range of 2000–2500 km. The weapon's 'reaction time' in the normal readiness condition after its arrival at the launch site would have been 20 to 30 minutes and the 'holding time' at peak readiness (with a time of two to ten minutes before the missile could be launched) would be about a day.\n\nRT-15 was developed by the S.

The missile was carried on a T-10 heavy tank chassis in a sealed container with a striking resemblance to the US Atlas D ICBM. After missile erection, the container split longitudinally and was withdrawn.\n\nThe missile was developed in the early 1960s and was first seen on a mobile land launcher during May 1965. Six missiles were experimentally deployed with the 50th Independent Missile Battalion at the village of Lesnaya in Belorussia.

Wellman and starring Edward G. Robinson. Warner Bros. had purchased the David Belasco/Achmed Abdullah play \"The Honorable Mr. Wong\" about the Tong gang wars. Made during the few years before strict enforcement of the Production Code, \"The Hatchet Man\" has elements that would not be allowed later, such as adultery, narcotics, and a somewhat graphic use of a flying hatchet.\n\nThe opening crawl reads: “San Francisco’s Chinatown 15 years ago (1917) had the largest Oriental population of any colony outside China. Its 40,000 yellow residents were divided into various political factions known as Tongs, each governed by a president and council. These various Tongs were almost constantly at war, so the office of “hatchet man” was one of special importance. The honorable title of “hatchet man” was passed from father to son by inheritance only, and it was he, with the aid of his sharp axe, who dispensed the justice of the great God Buddha. ..\n\n“...Our story opens following the death of Hop Li, member of the powerful Lem Sing Tong, and we see his funeral procession passing down DuPont Street”...\n\nA huge dragon banner unfolds, declaring war. People panic: men sharpen hatchets; shops are shuttered. Wong Low Get (Edward G. Robinson) is summoned from Sacramento to take revenge for Hop's death. He is stunned when the council president, Nog Hong Fah (Dudley Digges), tells him that Sun Yat Ming (J. Carrol Naish), his friend since childhood, is the guilty party. Sun is surprised and pleased to see Wong. He has prepared for his own assassination: His will leaves everything to his old friend. He also asks Wong to raise his little daughter, Toya San, and marry her when she comes of age. Wong agrees—and then reveals that he is the Lem Sing Tong hatchet man. Wong swears before the great Lord Buddha that Toya will never know “the song of sorrow.” Sun calmly kneels and prays and forgives Wong's “innocent hand its stroke of justice.”\n\nChinatown “today”.. “a far cry from what we have just seen. Gone are the warring Tongs—Gone are the queues and chop-sticks.” Wong, a prominent businessman, is wealthy and happy. Nog detests change, especially the way that women are being spoiled “by intelligence and freedom”. It is Toya's (Loretta Young) birthday; it should be the day of her betrothal. Nog is appalled to learn that Wong will defy tradition and give her a choice. \n\nWong offers Toya his mother's ring and declares his love. He is overjoyed when she replies “My father's wish is also mine.” He kneels before the statue of Buddha, affirming his promise to bring her only happiness.\n\nOn the day of the wedding, the Bing Foo, an outlaw Tong based in Sacramento, declares war. Wong fears a nationwide conflict and the transformation of Tongs into gangsters. Nog hires bodyguards, and the handsome young gangster, Harry En Hai (Leslie Fenton) is assigned to Wong. Toya is a modern girl with a good education, and at first she gives Harry the brush off.\n\nWong and Toya are happy together, but threats and blackmail from Sacramento continue. Wong's devoted clerk, Chung Ho, is killed, and Wong goes to Sacramento to meet with the Bing Foo. Only Big Jim Malone, the white gangster who started the war, refuses to cooperate. Wong eliminates him, and the war ends. \n\nMeanwhile, Harry has seduced Toya. When Wong returns, he finds them embracing passionately. She steps between Harry and Wong, and recalls his promise to make her happy, always. Wong gives Toya and her happiness to Harry, making him swear, warning that if he breaks faith Buddha will find him. Because of this “unworthy act”, Wong is stricken from the Tong's records everywhere. Shunned, he falls into poverty.\n\nAt last, Wong hears from Toya in a note, “written from a living death” in China, to tell him she loves only him. The government caught Harry selling opium, and deported both of them. Wong redeems his hatchets from pawn and heads across the Pacific to China, working as a stoker.\n\nToya is prisoner in an opium den/brothel, sold to Madame Si-Si by Harry. Harry sees Wong, but thinks he is a drug-induced hallucination. Toya faints when she sees him, but Wong has only love for her. He confronts Madame Si-Si and demands his wife, by ancient Chinese law and on the honor of a hatchet man. Madame SiSi scoffs; he proves it by hitting the eye of a dragon in a wall painting. Toya and Wong leave. He promises to return for Harry. On the other side of the partition, Madame Si Si shrieks at an unresponsive Harry while her servant removes the hatchet from the partition—and from Harry's skull. Harry's body falls, Cut to the statue of Buddha; Wong repeats his warning to Harry. “The great Lord Buddha will find you no matter where you are on the face of the Earth”.\n\n\nContemporary reviews, including \"The New York Times\", make the mistake of calling J. Carroll Naish's character “Sun Yat Sen” instead of Sun Yat Ming, a slip probably caused by familiarity with the name of the real Sun Yat Sen, one of the great leaders of modern China. \n\nAccording to Naish's obituary in \"The New York Times\", this was his first major film and the first of his many dialect roles, but he never played his own ethnicity—Irish.\n\nThroughout the film, Music Director Leo F. Forbstein uses variations on “Poor Butterfly“, a popular song released in 1916. “Poor Butterfly” was inspired by Giacomo Puccinni's tragic opera Madama Butterfly. \n\nThe film was released in Britain as \"The Honourable Mr. Wong\".\n\nTCM's Brian Cady observes: “As was typical of the time, almost no Asian actors appear in the cast of a film set completely among Chinese characters. Makeup artists had noticed that audiences were more likely to reject Western actors in Asian disguise if the faces of actual Asians were in near proximity. Rather than cast the film with all Asian actors, which would have then meant no star names to attract American audiences, studios simply eliminated most of the Asian actors from the cast.”\n\nMordaunt Hall of \"The New York Times\" described the film as a “grim melodrama...a fast-moving tale with an Oriental motif and one of its particularly effective features is the make-up of the players, not so much that of Mr. Robinson but of others, especially Dudley Digges and Loretta Young...” \n\nLeonard Maltin gives the picture two and a half out of four stars, calling it a “Fascinating yarn about Chinatown tongs, and Robinson's attempts to Americanize himself. Potent melodrama, once you get past obvious barrier of Caucasian cast.“\n\nAccording to Warner Bros. records, the film earned $491,000 in the U.S. and $251,000 elsewhere.\n\n\n"}

Dragon Khan boasts eight inversions, which was a world record until the opening of the ten-inversion Colossus in Thorpe Park, United Kingdom in 2002.\n\nThe ride, built by Bolliger & Mabillard (B&M), opened on May 2, 1995 and was one of the two roller coasters present upon PortAventura's opening. The track is red with white and pastel blue supports; the trains are green, blue and purple (a third train is run at peak times only).\n\nAfter boarding the ride, riders climb to the top of the lift hill , crossing under one of Shambhala's return airtime hills. At the crest of the lift hill, Dragon Khan's track crosses under Shambhala's lift hill and hits a pre-drop. The track makes a right hand turn, then immediately dives down the first drop, threading under Shambhala's first drop and over its splashdown, and entering a vertical loop. This is immediately followed by a dive loop. Right after this, the track goes through a zero-g roll which threads through the second vertical loop, and a cobra roll. The track then rises up into the midcourse brake run. Off the midcourse brake run, the track makes a near-miss with Shambhala's first drop as it drops to the right, crossing under the exit from the first loop, and into a second vertical loop which wraps around the zero g roll. Leaving the second loop, the track passes goes through a 270 degree counterclockwise upward helix, before entering a set of interlocking corkscrews.

The ride, thus far, has more inversions than any other B&M coaster made before or after.\nThe ride has a total of three trains, each containing seven cars. Riders are arranged four across in a single row for a total of 28 riders per train.\n\nThe theme for this ride is based on Chinese mythology: the dragon Khan was the reincarnated spirit of the evil Prince Hu of Beijing. His fury was unleashed each time a human dared to climb atop his back. This links in with the fact that the ride is located at the very back of the park in the Chinese themed area. Due to this ride's placement, it can be seen from anywhere inside the park, as well as from nearby hotels and the Reus airport.\n\n"}

The fable describes how a hungry grasshopper begs for food from an ant when winter comes and is refused. The situation sums up moral lessons about the virtues of hard work and planning for the future.\n\nEven in Classical times, however, the advice was mistrusted and an alternative story represented the ant's industry as mean and self-serving. Jean de la Fontaine's delicately ironic retelling in French later widened the debate to cover the themes of compassion and charity. Since the 18th century the grasshopper has been seen as the type of the artist and the question of the place of culture in society has also been included. Argument over the fable's ambivalent meaning has generally been conducted through adaptation or reinterpretation of the fable in literature, arts, and music.\n\nThe fable concerns a grasshopper (in the original, a cicada) that has spent the summer singing while the ant (or ants in some versions) worked to store up food for winter. When that season arrives, the grasshopper finds itself dying of hunger and begs the ant for food. However, the ant rebukes its idleness and tells it to dance the winter away now. Versions of the fable are found in the verse collections of Babrius (140) and Avianus (34), and in several prose collections including those attributed to Syntipas and Aphthonius of Antioch. The fable's Greek original cicada is kept in the Latin and Romance translations. A variant fable, separately numbered 112 in the Perry Index, features a dung beetle as the improvident insect which finds that the winter rains wash away the dung on which it feeds.\n\nThe fable is found in a large number of mediaeval Latin sources and also figures as a moral ballade among the poems of Eustache Deschamps under the title of \"La fourmi et le céraseron\". From the start it assumes prior knowledge of the fable and presents human examples of provident and improvident behaviour as typified by the insects. As well as appearing in vernacular collections of Aesop's fables in Renaissance times, a number of Neo-Latin poets used it as a subject, including Gabriele Faerno (1563), Hieronymus Osius (1564) and (1604).\n\nThe story has been used to teach the virtues of hard work and the perils of improvidence. Some versions state a moral at the end along the lines of \"An idle soul shall suffer hunger\", \"Work today to eat tomorrow\", and \"July is follow’d by December\". In La Fontaine's Fables no final judgment is made, although it has been argued that the author is there making sly fun of his own notoriously improvident ways. But the point of view in most retellings of the fable is supportive of the ant. It is also influenced by the commendation in the biblical Book of Proverbs, which mentions the ant twice. The first proverb admonishes, \"Go to the ant, you sluggard! Consider her ways and be wise, which having no captain, overseer or ruler, provides her supplies in the summer, and gathers her food in the harvest\" (6.6-9). Later, in a parallel saying of Agur, the insects figure among the 'four things that are little upon the earth but they are exceeding wise. The ants are a people not strong, yet they provide their food in the summer.' (30.24-5)\n\nThere was, nevertheless, an alternative tradition also ascribed to Aesop in which the ant was seen as a bad example. This appears as a counter-fable and is numbered 166 in the Perry Index. It relates that the ant was once a man who was always busy farming. Not satisfied with the results of his own labour, he plundered his neighbours' crops at night. This angered the king of the gods, who turned him into what is now an ant. Yet even though the man had changed his shape, he did not change his habits and to this day goes around the fields gathering the fruits of other people's labour, storing them up for himself. The moral given the fable in old Greek sources was that it is easier to change in appearance than to change one's moral nature. It has rarely been noticed since Classical times. Among the few prominent collectors of fables who recorded it later were Gabriele Faerno (1564), and Roger L'Estrange (1692). The latter's comment is that the ant's \"Vertue and Vice, in many Cases, are hardly Distinguishable but by the Name\".\n\nBecause of the influence of La Fontaine's Fables, in which \"La cigale et la fourmi\" stands at the beginning, the cicada then became the proverbial example of improvidence in France: so much so that Jules-Joseph Lefebvre (1836–1911) could paint a picture of a female nude biting one of her nails among the falling leaves and be sure viewers would understand the point by giving it the title \"La Cigale\". The painting was exhibited at the 1872 Salon with a quotation from La Fontaine, \"Quand la bise fut venue\" (When the north wind blew), and was seen as a critique of the lately deposed Napoleon III, who had led the nation into a disastrous war with Prussia. Another with the same title, alternatively known as \"Girl with a Mandolin\" (1890), was painted by Edouard Bisson (1856–1939) and depicts a gypsy musician in a sleeveless dress shivering in the falling snow. Also so-named is the painting by Henrietta Rae (a student of Lefebvre's) of a naked girl with a mandolin slung over her back who is cowering among the falling leaves at the root of a tree.\n\nThe grasshopper and the ant are generally depicted as women because both words for the insects are of the feminine gender in most Romance languages. Picturing the grasshopper as a musician, generally carrying a mandolin or guitar, was a convention that grew up when the insect was portrayed as a human being, since singers accompanied themselves on those instruments. The sculptor and painter Ignaz Stern (1679–1748) also has the grasshopper thinly clad and shivering in the paired statues he produced under the title of the fable, while the jovial ant is more warmly dressed. But the anticlerical painter Jehan Georges Vibert has male characters in his picture of \"\"La cigale et la fourmi\"\" from 1875. It is painted as a mediaeval scene in which a minstrel with a tall lute on his back encounters a monk on a snow-covered upland. The warmly shrouded monk has been out gathering alms and may be supposed to be giving the musician a lecture on his improvidence. By contrast, the Naturalist Victor-Gabriel Gilbert (1847–1933) pictures the fable as being enacted in the marketplace of a small town in Northern France. An elderly stall-keeper is frowning at a decrepit woman who has paused nearby, while her younger companion looks on in distress. In his lithograph from the Volpini Suite, “Les cigales et les fourmis” (1889), Paul Gauguin avoids making a judgment. Subtitled ‘a souvenir of Martinique', it pictures a group of women sitting or lying on the ground while in the background other women walk past with baskets on their heads. He is content that they exemplify the behaviour proverbially assigned to the insects without moral comment.\n\nFor a long time, the illustrators of fable books had tended to concentrate on picturing winter landscapes, with the encounter between the insects occupying only the lower foreground. In the 19th century the insects grew in size and began to take on human dress. It was this tendency that was reproduced in that curiosity of publishing, the 1894 \"Choix de Fables de La Fontaine, Illustrée par un Groupe des Meilleurs Artistes de Tokio\", which was printed in Japan and illustrated by some of the foremost woodblock artists of the day. Kajita Hanko's treatment of the story takes place in a typical snowy landscape with the cricket approaching a thatched cottage, watched through a window by the robed ant. An earlier Chinese treatment, commissioned mid-century by Baron through his diplomatic contacts, uses human figures to depict the situation. An old woman in a ragged dress approaches the lady of the house, who is working at her spinning wheel on an open verandah.\n\nUse of the insects to point a moral lesson extends into the 20th century. In Jean Vernon's bronze medal from the 1930s, the supplicant cicada is depicted as crouching on a branch while the ant rears up below with its legs about a beechnut. Engraved to one side is its sharp reply, \"Vous chantiez, j’en suis fort aise./ Eh bien, dansez maintenant.\" (You sang? I’m glad; now you can dance.) Jacob Lawrence depicts much the same scene in his 1969 ink drawing of the fable, but with a different moral intent. There a weeping grasshopper stands before a seated ant who reaches back to lock his storeroom door. It is notable that artistic sentiment has by now moved against the ant with the recognition that improvidence is not always the only cause of poverty. Nevertheless, Hungary used the fable to promote a savings campaign on a 60 forint stamp in 1958. The following year it appeared again in a series depicting fairy tales, as it did as one of many pendents on a 1.50 tögrög stamp from Mongolia. In this case the main stamp was commemorating the 1970 World's Fair in Japan with a picture of the Sumitomo fairy tale pavilion.\n\nLa Fontaine's portrayal of the Ant as a flawed character, reinforced by the ambivalence of the alternative fable, led to that insect too being viewed as anything but an example of virtue. Jules Massenet's two-act ballet \"Cigale\", first performed at the Opéra-Comique in Paris in 1904, portrays the cicada as a charitable woman who takes pity on \"La Pauvrette\" (the poor little one). But La Pauvrette, after being taken in and fed, is rude and heartless when the situation is reversed. Cigale is left to die in the snow at the close of the ballet.\n\nLa Fontaine's poem has also been subverted by several French parodies. In Joseph Autran's \"Réhabilitation de la fourmi\", the ant, while only having straw to eat himself, agrees to share his stocks with the cicada, so long as she sings him a song that would remind them of the summer, which, to him, will be more than worth the price. Tristan Corbière's \"A Marcelle - le poete et la cigale\" is a light-hearted literary criticism of a bad poet. In the 20th century, Jean Anouilh uses it as the basis for two almost independent fables. In \"La fourmi et la cigale\" the ant becomes an overworked housewife whom the dust follows into the grave. The cicada’s comment is that she prefers to employ a maid. In \"La Cigale\", Anouilh engages with the reality of the artistic life, reviewing the cicada as the type of the female musician. In this fable she figures as a night-club singer who asks a fox to act as her agent. He believes that she will be an easy victim for his manipulations but she handles him with such frosty finesse that he takes up singing himself. Pierre Perret's 1990 version in urban slang satirises the cicada's more traditional role as a thoughtless ‘queen of the hit parade’. The subversion lies in the four-line moral at the end, in which he advises that it is better to be an impresario than a performer.\n\nThe English writer W. Somerset Maugham reverses the moral order in a different way in his short story, \"The Ant and The Grasshopper\" (1924). It concerns two brothers, one of whom is a dissolute waster whose hard-working brother has constantly to bail out of difficulties. At the end the latter is enraged to discover that his 'grasshopper' brother has married a rich widow, who then dies and leaves him a fortune. The story was later adapted in the film \"Encore\" (1951) and the English television series \"Somerset Maugham Hour\" (1960). James Joyce also adapts the fable into a tale of brotherly conflict in \"The Ondt and the Gracehoper\" episode in \"Finnegans Wake\" (1939) and makes of the twin brothers Shem and Shaun opposing tendencies within the human personality:\n\nIn America, John Ciardi's poetical fable for children, \"John J. Plenty and Fiddler Dan\" (1963), makes an argument for poetry over fanatical hard work. Ciardi's ant, John J. Plenty, is so bent upon saving that he eats very little of what he has saved. Meanwhile, Fiddler Dan the grasshopper and his non-conforming ant wife survive the winter without help and resume playing music with the return of spring.\n\nAmbrose Bierce has two variant of the tale in his \"Fantastic Fable\". In the first, \"The Grasshopper and the Ant\", after the ant asks the grasshopper why it didn't make any stocks, it replies that it actually did, but the ants broke in and took them all away. In another, \"The Ants and the Grasshopper\", the grasshopper is a miner who was too busy digging to prepare, while the ants are replaced by politicians, for whom it is his work which is \"profitless amusement\".\n\nJohn Updike's 1987 short story \"Brother Grasshopper\" deals with a pair of brothers-in-law whose lives parallel the fable of the ant and the grasshopper. One, Fred Barrow, lives a conservative, restrained existence; the other, Carlyle Lothrop, spends his money profligately, especially on joint vacations for the two men's families, even as he becomes financially insolvent. However, at the end comes an unexpected inversion of the characters' archetypal roles. When Carlyle dies, Fred, now divorced and lonely, realizes that he has been left with a rich store of memories which would not have existed without his friend's largesse.\n\nFinally, \"Revolution\" (\"La Rivoluzione\"), a poem by the Italian Communist writer Gianni Rodari, offers an alternative political moral by cutting through the debate over duty, compassion, and utilitarianism that has been the legacy of La Fontaine's fable. He describes simply seeing an ant give half of his provisions to a cicada. Such generosity is the true revolution!\n\nThe Japanese writer Hoshi Shin'ichi wrote a revision of this fable in his \"Future Aesop\" (\"Mirai isoppu\"). In this version, the ants welcome the entertainment and pleasure of the grasshopper's music and dancing. An older ant bemoans the lack of work ethic, but the younger ants point out that they have so much food they can barely fit in their anthills -- indeed, some of it has sat around so long it turned into alcohol. The older ant, to chase away his worry about the topic, joins the younger ants in drinking and reveling.\n\nLa Fontaine's version of the fable was set by the following French composers:\n\nThere were two comic operas that went under the title \"La cigale et la fourmi\" in the 19th century. The one by Ferdinand Poise was in one act and dated 1870. The one by Edmond Audran was in three acts and performed in Paris in 1886, in London in 1890 and in New York in 1891. This was shortly followed by the darker mood of Jules Massenet's ballet \"Cigale\", mentioned above. Later adaptations of the fable to ballet include Henri Sauguet's \"La cigale at la fourmi\" (1941) and the third episode in Francis Poulenc's \"Les Animaux modèles\" (Model Animals, 1941). In the 21st century there has been \"La C et la F de la F\", in which the dancers interact with the text, choreographed by Herman Diephuis for Annie Sellem's composite presentation of the fables in 2004. It also figures among the four in the film \"Les Fables à la Fontaine\" directed by Marie-Hélène Rebois in 2004.\n\nThe Belgian composer Joseph Jongen set La Fontaine's fable for children's chorus and piano (op. 118, 1941) and the Dutch composer set the French text in \"Vijf fabels van La Fontaine\" (op. 25, 1964) for school chorus and orchestra. There is a happier ending in the American composer Shawn Allen's children's opera, \"The Ant and the Grasshopper\" (1999). At the end of this thirty-minute work, the two insects become musical partners during the winter after the ant revives the dying grasshopper.\n\nIvan Krylov's variant of the fable was set for voice and piano by Anton Rubinstein in 1851; a German version (\"Der Ameise und die Libelle\") was later published in Leipzig in 1864 as part of his \"Fünf Fabeln\" (Op.64). In the following century the Russian text was again set by Dmitri Shostakovich in \"Two Fables of Krylov\" for mezzo-soprano, female chorus and chamber orchestra (op.4, 1922). A Hungarian translation of the fable by Dezső Kosztolányi was also set for mezzo-soprano, four-part mixed chorus and 4 guitars or piano by Ferenc Farkas in 1977. The Catalan composer set the fable in his \"7 Fábulas de la Fontaine\" for recitation with orchestra in 1995. These used a Catalan translation by his father, the writer .\n\nThere have also been purely instrumental pieces; these include the first of Antal Dorati's \"5 Pieces for Oboe\" (1980) and the first of Karim Al-Zand's \"Four Fables for flute, clarinet and piano\" (2003).\n\nSettings of the Aesop version have been much rarer. It was among Mabel Wood Hill's \"Aesop's Fables Interpreted Through Music\" (New York, 1920). It was also included among David Edgar Walther's ‘short operatic dramas’ in 2009. In 2010 Lefteris Kordis set the Greek text as the second fable in his \"Aesop Project\" for octet and voice.\n\nLa Fontaine's fable lent itself to animated film features from early on, the first being a version by George Méliès in France in 1897. Others produced under the title \"La cigale et la fourmi\" were directed by Louis Feuillade (1909) and Georges Monca (1910). There were also Italian films under the title \"La cicala e la formica\" by Mario Caserini (1908) and Renato Molinari (1919). The Russo-Polish producer Ladislaw Starewicz made two versions using animated models. The first was in Russia in 1913 under the title \"Strekoza i muravey\", based on Ivan Krylov's Russian adaptation of La Fontaine; then, following his flight to France, and using the simplified name of Ladislas Starevich, he filmed a version under the French title (1927). In the UK, \"The Grasshopper and the Ant\" was created from cut-out silhouettes by Lotte Reiniger in 1954. In this the main characters, Grasshopper and Miss Ant, are portrayed as humanoid while the rest of the animals and insects are naturalistic. After being refused food and warmth by Miss Ant, Grasshopper is rescued from dying in the snow by squirrels and plays his fiddle for them. Miss Ant wistfully asks if she can join the party and is turned away by the rescuers until Grasshopper intervenes and asks her in to dance with them. In a based on Krylov's variant, the first eight minutes out of ten are taken up by the ants working hard as a society, while the dragonfly and her friends are having fun and interfering with the work. However, at the end, after the final words, an ant hands the dragonfly a snow shovel, indicating that she can still earn the right to be fed if she works alongside the others.\n\nIn America the Aesop's Film Fables studio had included \"The Ants and the Grasshopper\" (1921) among its early animated cartoon productions. Then in 1934 Walt Disney provided the story with a socially responsible conclusion in \"The Grasshopper and the Ants\" (discussed in the next section). He also adapted the story less directly in the \"Mickey's Young Readers Library\" segment, \"Mickey and the Big Storm\"; in this, Donald Duck and Goofy spend the first day of a winter snowstorm playing out in the snow and don't bother to stock up on supplies. Fortunately for them, Mickey has more than enough for himself and his friends. Friz Freleng also adapted the tale in his Warner Bros. cartoon \"Porky's Bear Facts\" in which Porky Pig works hard while his lazy neighbor refuses to do anything, only to suffer during winter. Although Porky at last gives him a meal out of good-neighborly feeling, the bear fails to learn his lesson when spring arrives.\n\nIn the later 20th century, there were a number of cynical subversions in TV shows. A typical example was the \"Muppet Show\" sketch in which Sam the Eagle's reading of the fable is undermined as the ant is stepped on at the end and the grasshopper drives off to Florida in his sports car.\n\nLa Fontaine follows ancient sources in his 17th century retelling of the fable, where the ant suggests at the end that since the grasshopper has sung all summer she should now dance for its entertainment. However, his only direct criticism of the ant is that it lacked generosity. The Grasshopper had asked for a loan which it promised to pay back with interest, but \"The Ant had a failing,/She wasn't a lender\".\n\nThe readers of his time were aware of the Christian duty of charity and therefore sensed the moral ambiguity of the fable. This is further brought out by Gustave Doré's 1880s print which pictures the story as a human situation. A female musician stands at a door in the snow with the children of the house looking up at her with sympathy. Their mother looks down from the top of the steps. Her tireless industry is indicated by the fact that she continues knitting but, in a country where the knitting-women (\"les tricoteuses\") had jeered at the victims of the guillotine during the French Revolution, this activity would also have been associated with lack of pity.\n\nOther French fabulists since La Fontaine had already started the counter-attack on the self-righteous ant. In around 1800 Jean-Jacques Boisard has the cricket answering the ant's criticism of his enjoyment of life with the philosophical proposition that since we must all die in the end, \"Hoarding is folly, enjoyment is wise\". In a Catholic educational work (\"Fables\", 1851) Jacques-Melchior Villefranche offers a sequel in which the ant loses its stores and asks the bee for help. The ant's former taunt to the grasshopper is now turned on himself:\n\nBut then the bee reveals that it has already given the grasshopper shelter and invites the ant to join him since 'All who are suffering/Deserve help equally.'\n\nLa Fontaine's fable also had a number of translations into Russian, in most of which the word used for the grasshopper is \"strekoza\". Though that word means a dragonfly today, at the time it could be used for a grasshopper as well. Ivan Krylov's best known \"The Grasshopper and the Ant\" (\"Strekoza i muravej\", 1808) follows the French original closely, but in the 1782 variant by Ivan Chemnitzer, simply titled \"The Grasshopper\", there is . This comments on the ant's final words that they were only spoken for the sake of teaching the grasshopper a lesson, after which the ant really did feed the grasshopper out of pity.\n\nIn the 20th century the fable entered the political arena. Walt Disney's cartoon version, \"The Grasshopper and the Ants\" (1934) confronts the dilemma of how to deal with improvidence from the point of view of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. The Grasshopper's irresponsibility is underlined by his song \"The World Owes us a Living\", which later that year became a Shirley Temple hit, rewritten to encase the story of the earlier cartoon. In the end the ants take pity on the grasshopper on certain conditions. The Queen of the Ants decrees that the grasshopper may stay, but he must play his fiddle in return for his room and board. He agrees to this arrangement, finally learning that he needs to make himself useful, and 'changes his tune' to\n\nIn recent times, the fable has again been put to political use by both sides in the social debate between the enterprise culture and those who consider the advantaged have a responsibility towards the disadvantaged. A modern satirical version of the story, originally written in 1994, has the grasshopper calling a press conference at the beginning of the winter to complain about socio-economic inequity, and being given the ant's house. This version was written by Pittsburgh talk show guru Jim Quinn as an attack on the Clinton administration's social programme in the USA. In 2008 Conservative columnist Michelle Malkin also updated the story to satirize the policies of 'Barack Cicada'. There have been adaptations into other languages as well. But the commentary at the end of an Indian reworking explains such social conflict as the result of selective media presentation that exploits envy and fear.\n\nThe fable has equally been pressed into service in the debate over the artist's place within the work ethic. In Marie de France's mediaeval version the grasshopper had pleaded that its work was 'to sing and bring pleasure to all creatures, but I find none who will now return the same to me.' The ant's reply is thoroughly materialistic, however: 'Why should I give food to thee/When you cannot give aid to me?' At the end of the 15th century, Laurentius Abstemius makes a utilitarian point using different insects in his similar fable of the gnat and the bee. The gnat applies to the bee for food and shelter in winter and offers to teach her children music in return. The bee's reply is that she prefers to teach the children a useful trade that will preserve them from hunger and cold.\n\nThe fable of \"A Gnat and a Bee\" was later to be included by Thomas Bewick in his 1818 edition of Aesop's Fables. The conclusion he draws there is that 'The many unhappy people whom we see daily singing up and down in order to divert other people, though with very heavy hearts of their own, should warn all those who have the education of children how necessary it is to bring them up to industry and business, be their present prospects ever so hopeful.' The arts are no more highly regarded by the French revolutionary Pierre-Louis Ginguené whose \"New Fables\" (1810) include \"The Grasshopper and the Other Insects\". There the Grasshopper exhorts the others to follow his example of tireless artistic activity and is answered that the only justification for poetry can be if it is socially useful.\n\nSuch utilitarianism was soon to be challenged by Romanticism and its championship of the artist has coloured later attitudes. In the early decades of the 20th century, the Romanian poet George Topîrceanu was to make the case for pure artistic creation in \"The ballad of a small grasshopper\" (\"Balada unui greier mic\"), although more in the telling than by outright moralising. A cricket passes the summer in singing; autumn arrives, but he continues. It is only in icy winter that the cricket realizes that he hasn't provided for himself. He goes to his neighbour, the ant, to ask for something to eat, but the ant refuses saying, “You wasted your time all summer long.” The English folk-singer and children's writer Leon Rosselson subtly turns the tables in much the same way in his 1970s song \"The Ant and the Grasshopper\", using the story to rebuke the self-righteous ant (and those humans with his mindset) for letting his fellow creatures die of want and for his blindness to the joy of life.\n\nIn the field of children's literature, Slade and Toni Morrison's rap retelling of the fable, \"Who's Got Game?: The Ant or the Grasshopper?\" (2003), where the grasshopper represents the artisan, provokes a discussion about the importance of art. An earlier improvisation on the story that involves art and its value was written by the Silesian artist Janosch under the title \"Die Fiedelgrille und der Maulwurf\" (The fiddling cricket and the mole), originally published in 1982 and in English translation in 1983. There the cricket fiddles for the entertainment of the animals all summer but is rejected by the stag beetle and the mouse when winter comes. She eventually encounters the mole who loves her music, especially because he is blind. and invites her to stay with him.\n\nThe theme had been treated at an even further distance in Leo Lionni's \"Frederick\" (1967). Here a fieldmouse, in a community narrowly focused on efficiently gathering for the winter, concentrates instead on gathering impressions. When the other mice question the usefulness of this, Frederick insists that 'gathering sun rays for the cold dark winter days' is also work. Indeed, the community comes to recognise this after the food has run out and morale is low, when it is Frederick's poetry that raises their spirits.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2038303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038303", "title": "Cosgrove, Northamptonshire", "text": "Cosgrove, Northamptonshire\n\nCosgrove is a village in Northamptonshire, England about north of Stony Stratford, north of central Milton Keynes and south of Northampton along the A508 road and south-east of Towcester along the A5 road (the Roman road Watling Street). The River Tove passes to the east of the village flowing into the River Great Ouse just south, the latter marking the boundary with Buckinghamshire and Milton Keynes. The Grand Union Canal passes through the middle of the village.\n\nImmediately south-east of the village the canal crosses the valley of the river Great Ouse on an embankment and aqueduct known as the Cosgrove Iron Trunk Aqueduct. The river was initially crossed on the level, with four temporary locks lowering the canal from the south-east, and five raising it from the river towards the north-west (the top lock of these is still in place). The temporary locks were used as a means of getting the canal open to through traffic by 1800 (this river crossing and the tunnel at Blisworth being the only two gaps by that year). However, it was always intended that the river should be crossed by aqueduct, as the locks were wasteful of water, time-consuming and the river in flood in winter could prevent through passage. A brick aqueduct was built, but collapsed in 1808, after which the locks were re-opened. It was replaced by the present Cosgrove aqueduct, built of cast iron, and opened on 22 January 1811. The old lock gates can still be seen beside the footpath below the canal embankment.\n\nThe Buckingham branch of the canal (also known as Buckingham Arm), an extension of the original proposal for a link to the main road at Old Stratford, was opened in 1801, diverging from the main line just to the south-east of the village, above the lock. It closed in the 1960s but there is a desire to re-open the now dry and defunct canal arm. The Buckingham Canal Society was formed to reopen the original canal line wherever possible.\n\nThis Buckingham branch froze more quickly and solidly than either the River Ouse or the main canal. This was noticed not only by skaters from miles around, but also by the owner of Cosgrove Hall, who in about 1820 built an ice-house half-way between the canal and the Hall. The ice house was constructed rather like a stone windmill, with very thick walls but, unlike the windmill, the ice house has its greater part below the level of the surrounding field. Into the ice house, every winter from 1820 until the 1900s, ice cut from the canal would be stored and packed around with straw. By this method it kept until the following spring and summer, when it would be sold to local fishmongers, butchers and others in the days before refrigeration. In recent years it has become derelict, but it was the last remaining in Buckinghamshire and one of the very few left in England.\n\nFor the past 200 years life in the village has been affected by the building of the canal and then later by the railway, now the West Coast Main Line. For a while the village was a very busy trading centre, with iron tracks at the canal wharf still evident, but in more recent years, with the advent of motorways and other means of transportation, life and business in the village has slowed down again. The traders have gone, and the village has returned to its natural, rural charm like much of Northamptonshire life.\n\nThere was once a cornmill on the River Tove, dating from 1086, which Robert Maudit granted to Roger the miller of Cosgrove and his son Robert for life in 1211. The Mill prospered until the early 20th century when it fell into disrepair and was demolished in 1979.\n\nThe gothic style Ornamental Bridge - called Solomon's Bridge - over the canal was built in 1790s at the insistence of a local landowner, the Biggins family, when the two halves of the canal joined here, one from Braunston, the other from Brentford. It is one of only two ornamental bridges over the canal.\n\nThe Parish Church is dedicated to St Peter and St Paul and parts date from the 13th century but is described by Pevsner as: \"badly over-restored...the result of E F Law trying to regothicize what had been made plain Georgian in 1770-4\". There is a memorial to Pulter Forester (d.1778). The tower is over 70 feet tall and contains six bells with one ‘Santa Maria’ dating to the 15th century.\n\nCosgrove Hall and its estate was built in the early 18th century on the site of an earlier house by the Furtho family. It is not open to the public. It may have been built by John Lumley of Northampton. The building was badly damaged by fire in October 2016.\n\nThe Priory was built in the 17th century by the Rigby family and is now privately owned. Originally known as the Manor House, the name was changed to The Priory in around 1810. Pevsner states that it has a Rood Screen from the time of Henry VIII.\n\nSt. Vincent's Well enclosed by iron railings behind the old National School in the High Street is said to have a high iron content, which some believe give the water remedial qualities.\n\nSouth-east of Cosgrove Hall and the church on the south bank of the canal is the site of a Roman Villa, bath house and temple discovered in 1957 and excavated in the 1950s and 60s. Many finds including an urn of silver coins were found during construction of the canal. This is about 1 mile from the Roman Road known as Watling Street.\n\nSouth west of the village are The Quarries, the remains of a medieval limestone quarry, now calcareous grassland, with a\nrich plant community of limestone-loving plants such as the spotted cat's ear and fragrant orchid. The site is also home to rare insects such as the ground beetle and birds such as the skylark and barn owl.\n\nCosgrove Leisure Park attracts many visitors, caravanners and holiday-makers. The park is built on an area of flooded gravel pits near the River Great Ouse south of the village. It has a swimming and paddling pool, fishing lakes and a water sports including water-skiing and jet-skiing. There are pitches for 500 touring caravans and 460 owner-occupied static holiday homes.\n\n"}

For example, three cuts across a pancake will produce six pieces if the cuts all meet at a common point inside the circle, but up to seven if they do not. This problem can be formalized mathematically as one of counting the cells in an arrangement of lines; for generalizations to higher dimensions, \"see\" arrangement of hyperplanes.\n\nThe analogue of this sequence in three dimensions is the cake number.\n\nThe maximum number \"p\" of pieces that can be created with a given number of cuts , where , is given by the formula\n\nUsing binomial coefficients, the formula can be expressed as\n\nSimply put, each number equals a triangular number plus 1.\n\nThis sequence , starting with , thus results in\n\nWhen a circle is cut times to produce the maximum number of pieces, represented as , the th cut must be considered; the number of pieces before the last cut is , while the number of pieces added by the last cut is .\n\nTo obtain the maximum number of pieces, the th cut line should cross all the other previous cut lines inside the circle, but not cross any intersection of previous cut lines. Thus, the th line itself is cut in places, and into line segments. Each segment divides one piece of the -cut pancake into 2 parts, adding exactly to the number of pieces. The new line can't have any more segments since it can only cross each previous line once. A cut line can always cross over all previous cut lines, as rotating the knife at a small angle around a point that is not an existing intersection will, if the angle is small enough, intersect all the previous lines including the last one added.\n\nThus, the total number of pieces after cuts is\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved.

He was renowned as an expert gunner, and some believe him to be the first officer to take a truly scientific approach to gunnery.\n\nHastings was born on 3 July 1790, the fourth son (and seventh child) of Rev. James Hastings (later Rector of Martley, Worcestershire) and Elizabeth (\"née\" Paget). He was brother to Sir Charles Hastings (founder of the British Medical Association). Another brother, Francis Decimus Hastings (1796-1869), also served in the Royal Navy from the age of twelve, reaching the rank of Rear-Admiral in 1859 having been obliged to relinquish active service because of his wounds, hardships and length of service.\n\nWhile a lieutenant in 1812, he painted \"Storm at Sea\". On 29 April 1812, Hastings participated in an attack led by Captain Thomas Ussher on French privateers of Málaga, in which he performed admirably, commanding twenty men in the attack.\n\nIn 1814, as a first lieutenant of the , he escorted Napoleon into his exile on Elba, and was one of three officers responsible for the arrangements for the arrival of Napoleon. From 14 November 1828 until 22 July 1830, he commanded in the Mediterranean with the rank of commander. He was then promoted captain.\n\nOn 13 April 1832, Captain Hastings took command of the sixth-rate training ship . As far back as 1817 General Sir Howard Douglas had submitted plans to remedy the obvious deficiencies of British naval gunnery. Nothing was done until 1830 when Commander George Smith was appointed to \"superintend the practice of Sea Gunnery\" on board that ship at Portsmouth. The gunnery school was put on a permanent basis by Captain Thomas Hastings (known at the time as \"Old Sting\").\n\nHe became noted for his training methods, although some in the admiralty disapproved of his emphasis on science, and found his reports on gunnery confusing, as they had little knowledge of science themselves. From a life of Sir John Barrow, the Secretary to the Admiralty through most of the first half of the 19th century, an interesting account appears; two years after Hastings' appointment to \"Excellent\", Sir John Briggs, Reader to the Board, happened to show the examination paper to an Admiral on the Board.\n\nHe was knighted in 1839. The first diving training in the Royal Navy occurred in 1844 under Hastings' watch.\n\nHe left command of \"Excellent\" on 28 August 1845, after his appointment as Storekeeper of the Ordnance on 25 July 1845. He held that post until it was abolished with the dissolution of the Board of Ordnance in 1855. On 27 September 1855 he was promoted rear admiral, and on 4 October 1862 vice admiral. On 2 April 1866, he retired from the navy with the rank of admiral. He died on 3 January 1870 at his home in London.\n\n"}
{"id": "2038308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038308", "title": "Depression cake", "text": "Depression cake\n\nDepression cake is a type of cake that was commonly made during the Great Depression. The ingredients include little or no milk, sugar, butter or eggs, because the ingredients were then either expensive or hard to obtain. Similar cakes are known as \"War Cake,\" as they avoided ingredients that were scarce or were being conserved for the use of soldiers. A common Depression Cake is also known as \"Boiled Raisin Cake,\" \"Milkless, Eggless, Butterless Cake,\" or \"Poor Man's Cake.\" \"Boiled\" refers to the boiling of raisins with the sugar and spices to make a syrup base early in the recipe. However, some bakers do include butter. Boiled raisin-type cakes date back at least to the American Civil War.\n\nDepression cake has been referred to as “War Cake” by texts dating back to World War I. In a pamphlet distributed by the United States Food Administration in 1918 entitled “War Economy in Food,” War Cake is listed under “Recipes for Conservation Sweets.” The United States Food Administration stressed the importance of reducing sugar consumption during the war and offered molasses, corn syrup, and raisins in its place.\n\nWhen the Great Depression hit America following the Stock Market Crash of 1929, families were forced to stretch their budgets and “make do” with minimal and cheap ingredients when it came to cooking. Some women were able to feed their families on $5 per week. Dessert became a luxury for most, and depression cake was a more affordable alternative to other cakes that used milk, eggs, and butter. Affordability was achieved through ingredient substitution. For example, shortening was substituted for butter, water was substituted for milk, and baking powder was substituted for eggs. Depression cake is just one of many examples of ingredient substitution during the Great Depression, as some women took full advantage of the practice by making mock foods such as mock apple pie and mock fish.\n\nRadio shows and women’s periodicals played a large role in circulating the recipe for depression cake during the Great Depression. Betty Crocker’s Cooking Hour was one such show that provided women with budget-friendly recipes. General Mills, owner of Betty Crocker, employed nutritionists and cooks to experiment with different ways of “ruining” a cake, such as ingredient omission. \nLoring Schuler’s Journal was a publication that also offered baking tips during the Great Depression, recommending replacing eggs with baking powder and using inexpensive grains and produce.\nA recipe titled \"War Cake\" was published in M.F.K. Fisher's book \"How to Cook a Wolf\" and republished in her \"The Art of Eating\"; it uses bacon grease on the premise that spices will mask its taste.\n\nPraised for its practicality and declared to be “the most worthwhile cake ever made,” depression cake is still baked in modern America. The recipe for it has been featured in an array of publications such as The Telegraph-Herald, The Pittsburgh Press, and The Modesto Bee.\n\nSome commonly used ingredients in depression cake:\n\nPears were sometimes substituted for apples.\n\nAn example for a depression cake recipe is as follows:\n\n\nThis is one example of a depression cake recipe. Other variations may include corn syrup, molasses, brown sugar, and various fruits. In some instances, bakers would leave the cake unfrosted or sprinkle the top with powdered sugar in lieu of icing. The interchangeability of ingredients makes the recipe for depression cake extremely versatile.\n\n"}

Its 1994 investment in taking over the New Amsterdam Theater spurred a revitalization of Broadway theatre. The company is a division of Disney Theatrical Group, led by Thomas Schumacher.\n\nWalt Disney Theatrical Production, Ltd. (DTP) was formed on with Ron Logan, Disney Park's live production head, as president to produce \"Beauty and the Beast\". \"Beauty and the Beast\" opened on Broadway at the Palace Theatre on . Disney Theatrical signed a 49-year revenue based lease for New Amsterdam Theatre in . The building was renovated by Disney Development Company. With \"The Lion King\" under consideration for the next Broadway adaption, Eisner ceded DTP to theatre-rooted Disney Animation president Peter Schneider and Thomas Schumacher, at their request, making them president and executive vice president of DTP respectively. In 1997, DTP re-opened the New Amsterdam Theatre with \"King David\" followed by \"The Lion King\" musical.\n\nPeter Schneider was promoted to Disney Studios president in January 1999, while Thomas Schumacher was promoted to president of Walt Disney Feature Animation and Walt Disney Theatrical Productions, while both are made co-presidents of Disney Theatrical. On , the corporate name was changed to Buena Vista Theatrical Group Limited, with Disney Theatrical Productions becoming a division of the group with the formation of Hyperion Theatricals in .\n\nSchneider left Disney Theatrical in June 2001 to form his own theater production company partly funded by Disney. His first project was developing and directing the stage version of \"Sister Act\" with Michael Reno. The musical had its official world premiere on November 3, 2006 at the Pasadena Playhouse, with DTP as an associated presenter during its Broadway run.\n\nIn 2013, Disney Theatrical revealed that a show based on The Muppets was in exploratory development and that a 15-minute show had been conducted by Thomas Schumacher to evaluate the technical components. Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn in November 2013 created a deal for Disney Theatrical Productions to develop a \"The Princess Bride\" stage adaptation, possibly either a musical or play.\n\n\"Freaky Friday\" musical was developed by Disney Theatrical Productions from the book and Disney films for theatres to license. The musical premiered in October 2016 at Signature Theatre in Arlington, Virginia followed by three other theatre productions. Coinciding with the August 10, 2018 release of the Disney Theatrical Productions Disney Channel Original Movie adaptation, a one-act version of the stage musical (based on the adaptation) was made available for licensing.\n\nDisney Theatrical Productions' \"Newsies\" debuted in Australian and New Zealand cinemas on February 19, 2017.\n\nThe show began previews in New York City on March 9, 1994 and officially opened at the Palace Theatre on April 18, 1994. The musical was the first Broadway adaptation by Disney, based on the 1991 animated film by Linda Woolverton and with music and lyrics by Alan Menken, Howard Ashman and Tim Rice. Several new songs were written for the Broadway musical, including \"Home\", a ballad sung by Belle which quickly became the signature song of the musical. It ran until July 29, 2007 at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, to make room for another Disney production, \"The Little Mermaid\". At 5,461 performances, the show is currently the ninth-longest run in Broadway history.\n\nIt has been performed internationally first at the Princess Theatre in Melbourne, Australia and has also been performed in London, Vienna, Toronto, Kyoto, Seoul, Stuttgart, Sydney, Mexico City, Guayaquil, Johannesburg, Madrid, Moscow, Milan, Sao Paulo and has also toured around the USA and United Kingdom. In the Netherlands this production was co-produced by Joop van den Ende's Stage Entertainment with new sets and costumes. On April 24, 2019 Disney Theatrical Groups revealed that \"Beauty and the Beast\" would return to Broadway. Thomas Schumacher announced that the Broadway revival would be updated. Theatre and dates have not been announced.\n\nThe show debuted July 8, 1997, in Minneapolis, Minnesota at the Orpheum Theatre, before premiering on Broadway at the New Amsterdam Theater on October 15, 1997 in previews with the official opening on November 13, 1997. On June 13, 2006, the Broadway production moved to the Minskoff Theatre to make way for the musical version of \"Mary Poppins\", which later was replaced by \"Aladdin\". It is now Broadway's third longest-running show in history.\nThe show uses a range of theatrical techniques, and is not a conventional musical. It has consistently been one of the highest grossing musicals on Broadway every week. The production won the Tony Award for Best Musical at the 1998 Tony Awards making it the first, and only, Disney musical to win.\n\nIts popularity has spawned several additional opening performances around the world, including in London, Toronto, Hamburg, Scheveningen, Sydney, Perth, Melbourne, Shanghai, Montreal, Tokyo, Paris, Nagoya, Russia, Seoul, Johannesburg, Las Vegas, Taipei, Tempe, Phoenix, Scottsdale, Mesa, Flagstaff, Madrid, Norway, Italy, Arabia, Gilbert, Scottsdale, Mexico City, Nepal, Finland, Switzerland, Chicago, Arizona, Anaheim, Poland, Hong Kong, Greece, Kenya, Milan, Moscow, Italy, and São Paulo.\n\nThe musical opened on June 5, 1999, for the opening of the Musical theater Berlin (now Theater am Potsdamer Platz). After a successful run, it closed in June 2002. Directed by James Lapine, the German translation was by Michael Kunze, choreography by Lar Lubovitch, set design by Heidi Ettinger, costume design by Sue Blane, lighting by Rick Fisher, sound by Tony Meola and projections by Jerome Sirlin.\n\nThis was Disney's first musical to premiere outside the US, and it became one of Berlin's longest-running musicals to date. As with Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King, \"Der Glöckner Von Notre Dame\" opened three years after the release of the movie it is based on.\n\nThe musical is a darker, more gothic adaptation of the film. According to translator Michael Kunze, he was \"campaigning to allow Esmeralda to die at the end, as she does in the book. There was a feeling that the audience would be depressed if Esmeralda dies. I feel that a European audience would see this as a very romantic ending ... two lost souls finally find each other. People will cry, but they'll be moved. And it is a very romantic ending.\" The producers wanted to see how \"preview audiences react before making the final decision.\"\n\nIn 2008, Stephen Schwartz said, \"I think we're starting up \"Hunchback of Notre Dame\", hopefully, next year (2009). Rumor has reached my ear that it's happening.\" Thomas Schumacher, head of Disney Theatrical, discussed current and future stage productions in an article published by the \"Columbus Dispatch\" on September 21, 2008, including an English-language production of Hunchback.\nThe musical had its US premiere at La Jolla Playhouse from October 28 through December 7, 2014.

The La Jolla Playhouse production transferred to the Paper Mill Playhouse from March 4 through April 5, 2015. In 2017, the German version, with the same set decor, is playing in Berlin and München, Germany. In 2018, the production transferred to Stuttgart.\n\nThe show was based on the movie of the same name and the novel \"Tarzan of the Apes\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs, and debuted on Broadway on May 10, 2006 at the Richard Rodgers Theatre. The show was heavily publicized with Phil Collins and the lead actors promoting the new musical on several media shows including \"The Today Show\", \"Good Morning America\", and \"Live with Regis and Kelly\". After playing at the Richard Rodgers Theatre for over a year the show closed on July 8, 2007.\n\nOn April 15, 2007, the musical debuted in Europe in the Netherlands as the successor of \"The Lion King\" in Scheveningen. A Broadway musical had never previously arrived in the Netherlands so soon after its Broadway premiere. Phil Collins was a special guest at the 2006 s, where he announced the news that Tarzan was coming to the Netherlands. Due to the size of the Circustheater, the show was expanded beyond the original Broadway production.\n\nIn 2008, a new production opened in Germany. A casting show on TV called \"Ich Tarzan, Du Jane\" (\"I Tarzan, you Jane\") searched for actors for the roles of Tarzan and Jane.\n\nA revamped tour version had previously been announced to debut in January 2009 in Atlanta at the Theatre of the Stars. The new production was supposed to feature the same music and book, and directed and choreographed by Lynne Taylor-Corbett, with scenic design by Kenneth Foy, aerial design by Paul Rubin and lighting design by Ken Billington. The production was ultimately cancelled.\n\nThe musical began Broadway previews on November 3, 2007 and opened on January 10, 2008 at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, even through trouble due to the Local One stagehands strike, which ended on November 28, 2007. The world premiere took place at The Ellie Caulkins Opera House at the Denver Center of the Performing Arts in Denver, Colorado. The show features every song from the movie, as well as nine new songs written by Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater. The book was written by Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award-winning playwright Doug Wright, with direction by Francesca Zambello, choreography by Stephen Mear, scenic design by George Tsypin, costume design by Tatiana Noginova and lighting design by Natasha Katz. The musical on Broadway opened to mixed reviews.\n\nThe original Broadway cast featured Sierra Boggess as Ariel, Norm Lewis as King Triton, Sherie Rene Scott as Ursula, Eddie Korbich as Scuttle, Sean Palmer as Prince Eric, Brian D'Addario and Major Curda as Flounder, and Tituss Burgess as Sebastian.\n\nThe musical closed on August 30, 2009 after 685 performances and 50 previews. In 2012, a Dutch production premiered.\n\nIn November 2010, Alan Menken confirmed that a musical theatre adaptation of the show is in the works with a book written by Chad Beguelin. The show premiered at the 5th Avenue Theatre in Seattle from July 7 to July 31, 2011. Another production played at the Muny Theatre in St. Louis from July 5 – 13, 2012. The musical premiered on Broadway on February 26, 2014 (in previews) and officially on March 20, 2014 at the New Amsterdam Theatre, taking the place of \"Mary Poppins\", which closed on March 3, 2013.

Casey Nicholaw directed and choreographed, with Chad Beguelin writing the book and additional lyrics, Bob Crowley as the scene designer, and costume design by Gregg Barnes. It was also announced that the musical would open at London's West End officially in June 2016 at the Prince Edward Theatre, taking the place of the revival of \"Miss Saigon\", which closed on 27 February 2016.\n\nA stage version of Disney's Pinocchio opened in the Lyttleton Theatre at the Royal National Theatre, London on 1 December 2017, running until 10 April 2018.\n\nOn January 13, 2014, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced that a Broadway stage adaptation of the hit 2013 3D computer-animated musical film \"Frozen\" is in early development stages. On February 12, 2015, it was announced that the Broadway musical will be directed by two-time Tony nominee Alex Timbers and is aiming for the Broadway show to open in 2017. On February 9, 2016, it was announced that the musical was scheduled to open in spring 2018.\n\nA private reading of the stage version of the musical \"Frozen\" was held in May 2016, with Elsa was played by Betsy Wolfe and Anna was played by Patti Murin. On September 27, 2016, Michael Grandage was selected to take over as the director after Timbers left the production, with Christopher Oram coming on board as the scenic designer.\n\nA pre-Broadway tryout ran at the Buell Theatre in Denver, Colorado from August 17 to October 1, 2017. The original Denver and Broadway cast included Caissie Levy as Elsa, Patti Murin as Anna, Jelani Alladin as Kristoff, Greg Hildreth as Olaf, and John Riddle as Hans. Previews on Broadway at the St. James Theatre began on February 22, 2018, with the official opening on March 22, 2018. After 26 previews and 825 regular performances, \"Frozen\" had its last show on March 11, 2020. The show closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and on May 15, Disney announced that the show would not reopen on Broadway, but would prepare for tour.\n\nIn July 2017, Alan Menken said that he is working on a stage adaptation of the 1997 film, \"Hercules\". The Public Theater presented the world premiere of the musical from August 31 through September 8, 2019 at the Delacorte Theater. The cast will include Jelani Alladin (Hercules), Roger Bart (Hades), Jeff Hiller (Panic), Nelson Chimilio (Pain), James Monroe Iglehart (Phil), Ramona Keller (Thalia), Tamika Lawrence (Calliope), Krysta Rodriguez (Meg), and Rema Webb (Terpsichore).\n\nIn June 2020, Bob Iger said that he is working on a stage Disney adaptation of the 1988 film, \"Oliver & Company\".\n\nVariety stated that there is an \"Early-stages project [of] \"Jungle Book\", a tuner version (with songs from the movie) to be written and directed by Mary Zimmerman (\"Metamorphoses\").\" A joint mounting of the production occurred at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago and the Huntington Theatre in Boston in 2013, produced by special arrangement with Disney Theatrical Productions.

Sold in 1986, Laurence Pearce produced variants of the Jaguar XJS before producing a bespoke sports car, the Lister Storm. In 2013, Lister Cars was acquired by Lawrence Whittaker's company Warrantywise. Production of the original sports car restarted in 2014 and ten continuation Lister Jaguar Knobblys were built to celebrate Lister's 60th Anniversary. In 2016, the company announced the build and sale of the Lister Knobbly Stirling Moss. On 31 January 2018, the Lister LFT-666 (previously called the Lister Thunder) based on the Jaguar F-Type was announced.\n\nBeginning in 1954, company manager and racing driver Brian Lister brought out the first in a series of sports cars from a Cambridge iron works. Inspired by Cooper, he used a tubular ladder chassis, de Dion rear axle and inboard drum brakes. Like others, he used a tuned MG engine and stock gearbox. It made its debut at the British Empire Trophy at Oulton Park in 1954, with former MG driver Archie Scott Brown at the wheel. Later, Lister swapped in a Moore-tuned Bristol two-litre engine and knockoff wire wheels in place of the MG's discs to improve performance. For the sports car race supporting the 1954 British Grand Prix at Silverstone, Scott Brown won the two-litre class and placed fifth overall behind only works Aston Martins.\n\nIn 1955, a handful of Lister-Bristols were built with a new body built by an ex-Bristol employee with the aid of a wind tunnel. Despite its new fins and strakes, it was less successful than the original Lister-Bristol of 1954. Lister moved up to a six-cylinder motor from a Formula 2 Maserati A6GCS for their own car, while customers continued to receive the Bristol motor, sold for ₤3900. Lister also attempted single-seater racing with a multi-tube chassis powered by a Coventry-Climax motor and using an MG gearbox, but the car was a failure.\nFor 1957, Lister redesigned the car around a 3.4 litre Jaguar D-type XK inline-six, with an aerodynamic aluminium body. It was tested by racing journalist John Bolster, performing a 0–100 mph (0–160 km/h) run in 11.2 seconds. Driver Archie Scott Brown won the 1957 British Empire Trophy in the new Lister-Jaguar. Refined again in 1958, the Lister-Jaguar entered international competitions. Brown was killed that season when he crashed the Lister-Jaguar at Spa-Francorchamps. Lister also developed another single-seater car based on the Lister-Jaguar, for use in the unique Race of Two Worlds at Monza. Cars from this era are affectionately known as the \"Lister Knobbly\" cars, due to their curved bodywork.\n\nFor 1959, Lister hired aerodynamicist Frank Costin who produced entirely new bodywork built around a new Chevrolet Corvette power plant. However, the front-engine layout of the new Lister-Chevrolet was quickly eclipsed by the rear-engine layout of the new Cooper sports car. By the end of 1959 Lister withdrew from competition although production of sports cars continued for customers.\n\nIn 1963, Brian Lister was chosen by the Rootes Group to prepare the Sunbeam Tiger for the prototype category of the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The Ford V8-powered Tiger was still in the early stages of development while Lister was constructing the chassis at the Jensen factory. Lister upgraded the suspension and brakes, added an aerodynamic fastback hardtop with a more sloping windscreen and a Kamm tail. The Ford V8 engine was tuned by Carroll Shelby in order to allow it to produce instead of the in standard specification. The car was designed with a top speed of in mind, but were developed in a short time frame and suffered engine failures. Rootes later received a refund for the engines. The two cars and one prototype mule still exist. The failure of the cars and Rootes' bankruptcy led to the demise of Lister's tuning work as well.\n\nThe Lister company returned in 1986 as Lister Cars Ltd. based in Leatherhead, Surrey, with engineer Laurence Pearce tuning approximately 90 Jaguar XJSs and improving their top speed to over , with an asking price of over £100,000. Success at this endeavour led the newly formed company to design a new sports car, the Lister Storm. Launched in 1993, it would use the largest V12 engine ever fitted to a production car at that time, a 7.0 L unit derived from the Jaguar XJR9. The Storm was later developed for motorsport in various guises, winning the FIA GT Championship in 2000. Lister later developed a bespoke Le Mans Prototype, the Storm LMP in 2003.\n\nIn 2012, Lawrence Whittaker and his father visited the Lister factory to source parts when restoring a Lister Knobbly, and the opportunity to purchase the Lister Motor Company arose. In 2013, ownership of George Lister Engineering Limited of Cambridge, original intellectual property rights, the plans and drawings for all original Lister cars, as well as the property rights of Pearce's Lister Cars were bought by father and son Andrew and Lawrence Whittaker, who also own car warranty company Warrantywise. The new company, along with its associated partners, was rebranded as the Lister Motor Company Ltd. Ten months later, the Lister Motor Company announced the build and sale of the Lister Knobbly to mark 60 years since the first Lister Racing Car was built.\n\nThe new company started building of the original Lister designs in 2014. To celebrate the 60th Anniversary of The Lister Motor Company, the release of the Lister Knobbly was announced, described as the most successful racing car of the late 1950s. The Lister Knobbly was driven by some of the most notable racing car drivers of the 50s including: Archie Scott Brown, Stirling Moss, Ivor Beaub, Bruce Halford and Innes Ireland amongst many others.\nWithin a matter of weeks half of the 60th Anniversary Lister race cars were sold out. Soon after, the order book was completely full and Lister had orders for £5m.\n\nIn June 2016, The Lister Motor Company announced the build and sale of the Lister Knobbly Stirling Moss at the Royal Automobile Club in London. The car is built to the exact specification of the 1958 model and is the only magnesium-bodied car in the world and only the second car in history endorsed by legendary racing driver Sir Stirling Moss. Brian Lister invited Sir Stirling Moss to drive for Lister on three separate occasions, at Goodwood in 1954, Silverstone in 1958 and at Sebring in 1959, and to celebrate these races, 10 special edition lightweight Lister Knobbly cars are being built and priced at £1 Million each. The company announced that the cars will be available for both road and race use and Sir Stirling Moss will personally be handing over each car.\n\nIn January 2018, Lister announced the LFT-666. The car, which is a modified Jaguar F-Type R has a modified variant of the 5.0-litre supercharged V8 engine as utilised in the Jaguar F-Type SVR, generating at 6,000 rpm and a peak torque of achieved by dual modified supercharger pulleys, a modified intercooler, an improved air intake system and a different ECU. The Thunder is capable of accelerating from in 3.2 seconds and attaining a maximum speed of . The four-wheel drive layout and the 8-speed ZF automatic transmission with torque converter are retained from the F-Type while a Quicksilver titanium exhaust system saves of weight. The car has light weight 21-inch alloy wheels, acid green accents and brake callipers. The car has a Bridge of Weir Nappa leather interior that is available in 36 colour combinations, with the Lister logos stitched into the headrests and seat pattern to match the front grille. The car was unveiled at the Historic Motorsport International show, at London's ExCeL. The LFT-666 will be built in limited numbers, with only 99 cars to be produced in total having a base price of GB£141,155 while a carbon fibre bonnet adds GB£14,850 more to the base price. The owners will also receive access to the exclusive Lister driver's club.\n\nThe Stealth SUV was introduced in January 2019 with the codename LFP. Based on the Jaguar F-Pace, the LFP uses a modified version of the 5.0-litre supercharged V8 engine found in the F-Pace SVR having a power output of . Improved performance figures include a in 3.5 seconds and a claimed top speed of . The LFP has Lister specific colour schemes and interior trim. Production is limited to 250 units. \n\nAs of April 2020, the Lister LFP is now known as the Lister Stealth.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2038320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038320", "title": "Native plant", "text": "Native plant\n\nNative plants are plants indigenous to a given area in geologic time. This includes plants that have developed, occur naturally, or existed for many years in an area.\n\nAn ecosystem consists of interactions of plants, animals, and microorganisms with their physical (such as soil conditions and processes) and climatic conditions. Native plants form plant communities and biological interactions with specific flora, fauna, fungi, and other organisms. For example, some plant species can only reproduce with a continued mutualistic interaction with a certain animal pollinator, and the pollinating animal may also be dependent on that plant species for a food source. Some native plants have adapted to very limited, unusual, or harsh conditions, such as cold climates or frequent wildfires. Others can live in diverse areas or adapt well to different surroundings. \n\nThe diversity of species across many parts of the world exists only because bioregions are separated by barriers, particularly large rivers, seas, oceans, mountains, and deserts. Humans can introduce species that have never met in their evolutionary history, on varying time scales ranging from days to decades (Long, 1981; Vermeij, 1991). Humans are moving species across the globe at an unprecedented rate. Those working to address invasive species view this as an increased risk to indigenous species.\n\nAs humans introduce plants to new locations for cultivation, or transport them by accident, some of them may become invasive species, damaging native plant communities. Invasive species can have profound effects on ecosystems by changing ecosystem structure, function, species abundance, and community composition. Besides ecological damage, these species can also damage agriculture, infrastructure, and cultural assets. Government agencies and environmental groups are directing increasing resources to addressing these species. \n\nWhen restoration projects are undertaken to restore a native ecological system disturbed by economic development or other events, they may be historically inaccurate, incomplete, or pay little or no attention to ecotype accuracy or type conversions. They may fail to restore the original ecological system by overlooking the basics of remediation. Attention paid to the historical distribution of native species is a crucial first step to ensure the ecological integrity of the project. For example, to prevent erosion of the recontoured sand dunes at the western edge of the Los Angeles International Airport in 1975, landscapers stabilized the backdunes with a “natural” seed mix (Mattoni 1989a). Unfortunately, the seed mix was representative of coastal sage scrub, an exogenous plant community, instead of the native dune scrub community. As a result, the El Segundo blue butterfly \"(Euphilotes battoides allyni)\" became an endangered species. The El Segundo Blue butterfly population, which had once extended over 3200 acres along the coastal dunes from to Ocean Park to Malaga cove in Palos Verdes, began to recover when the invasive California buckwheat \"(Eriogonum fasciculatum)\" was uprooted so that the butterflies' original native plant host, the dune buckwheat \"(Eriogonum parvifolium),\" could regain some of its lost habitat.\n\nNative plant organizations such as Wild Ones, native plant societies, and Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center encourage the use of native plants, especially in public spaces. The identification of local remnant natural areas provides a basis for their work.\n\nThe use of native cultivars is a widely disputed practice among native plant advocates.\n\n"}

Released from the 1972 album \"Harvest\", it is so far Young's only U.S. No. 1 single. In Canada, it reached No. 1 on the \"RPM\" national singles chart for the first time on April 8, 1972, on which date Young held the top spot on both the singles and albums charts. \"Billboard\" ranked it as the No. 17 song for 1972. In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it No. 297 on their list of the 500 greatest songs of all time, and No. 303 in an updated 2010 list.\n\nThe song, which features backup vocals by James Taylor and Linda Ronstadt, is one of a series of soft acoustic pieces which were written partly as a result of a back injury. Unable to stand for long periods of time, Young could not play his electric guitar and so returned to his acoustic guitar, which he could play sitting down. He also played his harmonica during the three instrumental portions, including the introduction to the song.\n\n\"Heart of Gold\" was recorded during the initial sessions for \"Harvest\" on February 6–-8 1971 at Quadrafonic Sound Studios in Nashville, Tennessee. Ronstadt (who herself would later cover Young's song \"Love Is a Rose\") and Taylor were in Nashville at the time for an appearance on Johnny Cash's television program, and the album's producer Elliot Mazer arranged for them to sing backup for Young in the studio.\n\nYoung played this song in 1971 solo shows before recording it. At a January 19 concert (preserved on \"Live at Massey Hall 1971\", released in 2007) he played it on piano, starting with \"A Man Needs a Maid\" and then segueing into this song. By the time of \"Harvest\" he had separated the two songs and played \"Heart of Gold\" on guitar and harmonica.\n\nYoung wrote in the liner notes of his 1977 compilation album \"Decade\": \"This song put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.\" This statement was in response to the mainstream popularity that he gained as a result of the number-one status of \"Heart of Gold\".\n\nIn 1985, Bob Dylan admitted that he disliked hearing this song, despite always liking Neil Young:\n\nThe only time it bothered me that someone sounded like me was when I was living in Phoenix, Arizona, in about '72 and the big song at the time was \"Heart of Gold\". I used to hate it when it came on the radio. I always liked Neil Young, but it bothered me every time I listened to \"Heart of Gold.\" I think it was up at number one for a long time, and I'd say, \"Shit, that's me. If it sounds like me, it should as well be me.\"\n\nIn 2005, \"Heart of Gold\" was named the third greatest Canadian song of all time on the CBC Radio One series \"\". It ranked behind only Barenaked Ladies' \"If I Had $1,000,000\" and Ian and Sylvia's \"Four Strong Winds\", the latter covered by Young on his 1978 album \"Comes a Time\".\n\n"}

It was released as a single for Christmas that December by RCA Victor. The flip side was \"Silk Stockings\" (which scored in the \"Cash Box\" magazine top 50). \"Home for the Holidays\" reached No. 8 on the \"Billboard\" magazine chart in the United States. The next Christmas it was released again, with \"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen\" as the flip side.

Other remarkable summits in the municipality are \"Roque Nublo\" (\"Cloud Rock\") and \"Roque Bentayga\" (\"Bentayga Rock\") with its ritual place (\"almogarén\") and other features. Close by are the \"cuevas del Rey\" (\"the King's caves\", 1 km to the west of Rock Bentayga), an antique cave house village with granaries; and 2 km further west the antique cave house village of \"Acusa Seca\". All these sites are listed Spanish Heritage as Properties of cultural interest (\"\"Bien de Interés Cultural\"\").\n\nThe village of Tejeda sits on the eastern edge of a volcanic basin or crater that bears its name (\"caldera de Tejeda\").\n\nThe \"caldera\"’s dimensions are 28 km x 18 km, with a surface that extends from the head of Agaete's ravine (\"barranco de Agaete\") near Artenara, to \"Verde Andén\" (\"Green Platform\") in the west, Veneguera and the head of Mogán ravine (\"barranco de Mogán\") up to Arguineguín's ravine (\"barranco de Arguineguin\"). Only half of its perimeter remains standing; on what is left of it are found a few green-bluish peaks (such as \"\"azulejos\" de Veneguera\" - \"Veneguera's tiles\") and below these are the oldest basalts of the island, primitive substrate of Grand Canary.\n\nThe \"caldera\" was produced in probably less than two hours, by the explosion of the residual magma chambers During the collapse of the \"caldera de Tejera\" ignimbrite rock was produced, with a pink matrix dotted with white crystals. It exists because the explosive eruption by which the \"caldera\" collapsed was so powerful that the magma was pulverized in a very fine spray and created almost microscopic structures in the matrix rock. \"Ignimbrita\" is found on the outside of the periphery of the \"caldera\". <br>\nThe \"caldera\" also bears traces of a 2 million year period of evolution. This is especially notable at the heads of the Agaete ravine (\"barranco de Agaete\") and Mogan ravine (\"barranco de Mogan\"), where we can see horizontal basaltic lavas in their lower parts and, above, thicker material in sloping layers.\n\nAnother rare feature of the caldera is its system of conical dykes in its center, that were damaged by the eruptions and determined the structure of the island by their own structure. The lava passed through these dykes during some eruptions, in particular basaltic eruptions ; this created a crack in the surrounding channels where the lava was injected, and from them the volcano arose. In Grand Canary these conical dykes were centered on a focal point located roughly 2 km under sea level, at what was in the past the center of the island. New magma would then tend to also take the same conical shape. Conical dykes of this size are not found in other islands; Vallehermoso on La Gomera island has some smaller ones.\n\nBiologist Juan Sergio Socorro considers this crater to be one of the few clear examples in the world of a very large collapsed volcanic crater, particularly in comparison to the \"Cañadas del Teide\" for which several theories are held regarding its formation.\n\n<div align=center>\n\n</div align=center>\n\nIts population was 2,028 in 2013.\n\n"}

The South Korean designation was established in 1973, replacing the Mother's Day previously marked on May 8, and includes public and private celebrations. The United States day was created in 1994 under President Bill Clinton. June 1 has also been proclaimed as \"Global Day of Parents\" by the United Nations as a mark of appreciation for the commitment of parents towards their children. In the Philippines, while it is not strictly observed or celebrated, the first Monday of December each year is proclaimed as Parents' Day.\n\nThe United Nations proclaimed June 1 to be the Global Day of Parents \"to appreciate all parents in all parts of the world for their selfless commitment to children and their lifelong sacrifice towards nurturing this relationship\". It is the same day as International Children's Day.\n\nIn the United States, Parents' Day is held on the fourth Sunday of July. This was established in 1994 when President Bill Clinton signed a Congressional Resolution into law () for \"recognizing, uplifting, and supporting the role of parents in the rearing of children.\" The bill was introduced by Republican Senator Trent Lott. It was supported by members of the Unification Church which also celebrates a holiday called Parents' Day, although on a different date. Parents' Day is celebrated throughout the United States.\n\nIn South Korea, Parents' Day ( \"Eobeoinal\") is annually held on May 8. Parents' Day is celebrated by both the public and the government. Family events focus on the parents; popular actions include giving parents carnations. Public events are led by the Ministry of Health and Welfare and include public celebrations and awards.\n\nThe origins of Parents' Day can be traced back to the 1930s. Starting in 1930, some Christian communities began to celebrate Mother's Day or Parents' Day. This tradition was combined with Korea's traditional Confucianism culture to eventually establish Mother's Day. In 1956, the State Council of South Korea designated May 8 as an annual Mother's Day. However, the question of Father's Day was discussed and on March 30, 1973, May 8 was designated as Parents' Day under Presidential Decree 6615, or the \"Regulations Concerning Various Holidays\" (각종 기념일 등에 관한 규정). When Parents' Day was first established, the entire week with the 8th day was designated to be a week to respect the elderly, but respecting elders in the month of May was abolished in 1997 with October becoming the month designated for respecting the elderly.\n\nMothers' Day is traditionally celebrated on the first Monday of December. On this day, children placed pink cadena de amor on their chest. Children who no longer have mothers place white cadena de amor.\n\nIn 1921, Circular No. 33 designating the first Monday every December as Mothers' day was issued, as a response to the appeal Ilocos Norte Federation of Woman's Clubs. During the Philippine Commonwealth Government, then President Quezon issued Proclamation No. 213, s. 1937 declaring the day designated as Mothers' Day as Parents' Day. This was due to finding petitions to set a special date for Fathers’ Day not advisable as there are already set of numerous holidays set, and deeming it more fitting to celebrate both Mothers' and Fathers' Day together and not apart. In 1980, a proclamation was issued declaring first Sunday and the first Monday of December as Father's Day and Mother's Day respectively. In 1988, the issued presidential proclamation followed the international day of celebration of Father's and Mother's Day which most Filipinos are familiar with. However, then President Estrada tried to revive the tradition through Proclamation No. 58, s. 1998.\n\n\n\n"}

It can also be formed as the union of two circular segments (regions between the chord of a circle and the circle itself), joined along a common chord.\n\nIf the two arcs of a lens have equal radius, it is called a symmetric lens, otherwise is an asymmetric lens.\n\nThe vesica piscis is one form of a symmetrical lens, formed by arcs of two circles whose centers each lie on the opposite arc. The arcs meet at angles of 120° at their endpoints.\n\nThe area of a symmetric lens can be expressed in terms of the radius \"R\" and arc lengths \"θ\" in radians:\n\nThe area of an asymetric lens formed from circles of radii \"R\" and \"r\" with distance \"d\" between their centers is\n\nwhere \n\nis the area of a triangle with sides \"d\", \"r\", and \"R\".\n\nA lens with a different shape forms part of the answer to Mrs. Miniver's problem, which asks how to bisect the area of a disk by an arc of another circle with given radius.

He sat as the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Southwark from 1818 to 1831. He served as the Governor of Gibraltar from 1842 until his death in 1849.\n\nBorn in London, he was the grandson of a Leeds wool merchant, and the fourth child of painter and portraitist Benjamin Wilson. Orphaned at the age of twelve he was raised and educated by his uncle and guardian, William Bosville, later attending Westminster School.\n\nHe eloped in his twenties with Jemima, the daughter of Colonel William Belford. She bore him thirteen children in the following 15 years.\n\nHe had a distinguished career in the Army and the diplomatic service. In 1794, as an ensign in the 15th Light Dragoons, Wilson fought in the celebrated Battle of Villers-en-Cauchies where a handful of cavalry smashed a much larger French force. He was made a Knight Bachelor in 1801. In 1804 he became a lieutenant-colonel in the 19th Light Dragoons. He was expelled from Russia as a spy after the Treaty of Tilsit. During the Peninsular War he organized Portuguese soldiers into the Loyal Lusitanian Legion. During the British retreat from the Iberian peninsula in January 1809, Wilson refused to comply with the withdrawal and instead decided to oppose the incoming 9,000-man corps commanded by the French General Pierre Belon Lapisse. He installed half of his 1,200 Lusitanian Legion in the fortress of Almeida and arranged the rest in a thin screen. He then harried the opposition with such remorseless energy that Lapisse, convinced he was confronted by a far more numerous enemy, switched entirely to the defensive. In summer 1809, Wilson's Legion again formed an important part of the Anglo-Portuguese network of advance posts and was placed on the Spanish frontier to provide early warning of French moves while the British commander Wellington advanced on Oporto. In Wellington's advance on Talavera in spring 1809, Wilson's Lusitanians again formed a valuable flank guard. In the aftermath of the Battle of Talavera, when the French General Victor and his corps threatened to cut Wellington's forces off from the south, Wilson's small flank column of 1,500 men surprised Victor's 19,600 men from the north. In the face of this unclear threat, Victor panicked and precipitously withdrew to Madrid. On 12August 1809, Wilson with 4,000 men, including two battalions of the Legion, was defeated by French forces under Marshal Michel Ney at the Battle of Puerto de Baños. Facing treble the number of French, Wilson nevertheless managed to maintain his position for nine hours. He lost nearly 400 men while inflicting 185 casualties on the French. Wilson returned to Russia in 1812 as a liaison officer. He was a sharp observer during the events of Napoleon's disastrous retreat from Moscow and was present at the Battle of Krasnoye. He also assisted in the November 1815 escape of the Bonapartist Lavalette from Paris.\n\nIn 1817, near the start of the Great Game, he published the anti-Russian \"A Sketch of the Military and Political Power of Russia\".\n\nIn 1818, Wilson became an MP for Southwark. In 1821, now a Radical MP he attended the funeral of Queen Caroline (the wife of George IV), a very controversial figure whose treatment by her husband had led her to be celebrated by the 'loud' section of the general populace. Her supporters, considering that they were not being allowed by the authorities to celebrate this occasion as they wished, became unruly. Soldiers escorting the cortege but also on duty because of the Establishment's fear of the mob, upon being stoned, fired over the heads of the crowd. Wilson strode up and stated that, \"It is quite disgraceful to continue firing in this manner, for the people are unarmed. Remember you are soldiers of Waterloo; do not lose your honours gained on that occasion. You have had cannon shot at your head, never mind a few stones.\" The firing ceased as the officer in charge recognised Wilson, and the troops, although maintaining their cohesion 'retired'. A few weeks later Wilson was dismissed from the Army by the Duke of York. He was, however, to serve his country again.\n\nWilson was reinstated in the Army and promoted to lieutenant-general in 1830. He reached the rank of full general in 1841 and was appointed Governor of Gibraltar in 1842. He wrote a great deal about history and politics.\n\nWilson died suddenly on 9May 1849 at Marshall Thompson's Hotel in Cavendish Square, London. He is buried along with his wife in Westminster Abbey.\n\n\n\n\nBiographies:\n\nEdited works:\n\n"}

It was to run from Fishkill northeast and north to meet the New York and Harlem Railroad at Craryville. Millbrook resident, George H. Brown, was elected president. The road was promoted largely by New York bankers who had financial interests in the town of Washington. Several Dutchess County towns along the proposed route bonded themselves to aid in the construction of the road. Hesitation on the part of Columbia County townships to do likewise, together with the influence of some politicians in the northern section of Dutchess County, caused the promoters change the route to turn east at Pine Plains, going over the mountains to Millerton by way of Bethel, Shekomeko and Winchells. It was also extended to State Line to connect with the Connecticut Western. \n\nConstruction began in 1868, and teams of horses pulled wagon loads of rails to be distributed along the right of way from Little Plum Point (Dutchess Junction) through Matteawan, Glenham, Fishkill and Brinckerhoff to near Old Hopewell. Bridges were built over Fishkill Creek and Sprout Creek. After this section was in place more rails would be hauled by trains to complete the line. The line reached north to Pine Plains by July 1, 1869. Construction reached Millerton in the northeast corner of the county in November 1871.\n\nA short four-mile connecting Railroad called the Clove Branch was chartered in 1868 and opened in 1869. The CB connected with the D&C near Old Hopewell, and its main purpose was to haul iron ore out of the mine at Sylvan Lake. Later the CB was extended another four miles and ran passenger and freight service to a few customers and an iron furnace in Clove Valley. The president was the same George H. Brown who was President of the D&C RR. Operations were suspended in 1897 and it was abandoned in 1898. traces of the Clove branch right-of-way are stillvisible west of Poughquag, NY, and the iron smelter it served in Clove Valley is still standing.\n\nThe Boston, Hartford and Erie Railroad was formed from three separate companies:\n\nIn 1849, the two Connecticut companies merged to form the Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad, with a modified charter to continue past Brewster to Fishkill, New York on the Hudson River. In 1851 the Rhode Island company was merged into it. Later that year the first section opened, from Hartford east to Willimantic. Extensions opened east to Providence in 1854 and west to Waterbury in 1855. The HP&F went bankrupt on January 1, 1858, and was run by the trustees until 1863, when it was leased by the newly formed Boston, Hartford and Erie Railroad. In May 1863, the Boston, Hartford and Erie Railroad was chartered to take over operations of the failed lines and continue the line west to Fishkill, New York, with a car float from there to the Erie Railroad at Newburgh. On December 1865 a number of Erie Railway men were elected to the BH&E board, placing it under partial control of the Erie.\n\nThe BH&E planned to connect New England cities with a shipping terminal on the Hudson River, and purchased property at Dennings Point adjacent to the Dutchess Junction starting point of the D&C RR. In November 1868, with approximately eleven miles of track built, D&C President George H. Brown leased the entire operation of the D&C to the BH&E, providing that D&C complete construction of the line. \n\nThe D&C RR continued building the line and bought a used locomotive from a railroad in Pennsylvania naming it \"Tioronda\". It was a 4-4-0 wood burner that had been built in 1856. It arrived at Dutchess Junction on 8 February 1869. Later it purchased two more from New Haven. These were named \"Washington\" and \"Pine Plains\" for the towns which the D&C/BH&E ran through. The chocolate brown coaches were lettered BH&E Railroad. The station at Plum Point/Dutchess Junction was not yet completed so on Monday, 21 June 1869 the first trip on the line left Fishkill Landing. They ran south along the Hudson River line to Plum Point/Dutchess Junction and then ran east on the new rail line. Trains used this route for a short time in 1869 until the station was finished at Dutchess Junction. By the winter of 1869/70 the rails had reached Bangall.\n\nIn November 1871 the Connecticut Western Railroad leased the short part of the D&C from the state line to the New York and Harlem Railroad at Millerton. Also using the line was the Poughkeepsie and Eastern Railroad, completed in 1872. The P&E obtained trackage rights over the part D&C line from Stissing Junction north to Pine Plains, in order to connect sections of its own line.\n\nOn November 18, 1872 these two roads were consolidated with the D&C as the New York, Boston & Northern Railroad Company with plans to run track from New York City north into Vermont and on to Montreal.\n\nThe Lebanon Springs Railroad Company and the Bennington and Rutland Railroad Company combined in 1870 to form the Harlem Extension Railroad which then absorbed the Pine Plains and Albany in 1873. Then in 1873 the NYB&N and the Harlem Extension merged to form the New York, Boston & Montreal Railroad Company. The D&C would have been part of the main line from near the future Hopewell Junction north to Pine Plains.The Panic of 1873 stopped the construction of these combined lines and the NYB&M went bankrupt, followed by the D&C in 1874.\n\nThe ND&C was built as the Dutchess and Columbia railroad under the guidance of George H. Brown of Millbrook. The grand idea was to construct a line to ferry material across the Hudson River from the Erie at Newburgh and carry it into Connecticut, while also serving the farms and quarries of Dutchess County.\n\nThe D&C was sold on August 5, 1876 and reorganized January 25, 1877 as the Newburgh, Dutchess and Connecticut Railroad. To tap the Pennsylvania coal traffic, the D&C built a ferry terminal at Dutchess Junction. In addition to hosting a number of brickyards, \"at the peak of operations, Dutchess Junction was a thriving town with a train station that served two railroads, the ND&C Railroad and the NYC&HR Railroad. There was also a ferry and freight dock for Hudson River boat traffic. The ND&C Railroad repair shops were located at Dutchess Junction. Workers lived in tenement houses owned by the railroad. Descriptions of the ND&C facilities include a locomotive repair shop, a carpenter shop, brass foundry, paint shop, car repair and build shop, coal and water facilities plus a turntable with a roundhouse and train yard. Adjacent to the ND&C Railroad property was a brick manufacturing company. Dutchess Junction was a bustling, active community.\"\nRailroad cars were transferred across the Hudson River to connect with the Erie Railroad in Newburgh. There was also passenger and general freight service using Hudson River steamboats and barges. Stations along the line were built from the same set of plans and looked alike. Standard station colors were yellow with brown trim around the windows and doors. Station roofs were made of slate to combat the ever-present danger of fire from sparks from locomotive smokestacks.\n\nA steamboat shuttled freight and passengers back and forth across the river to and from Newburgh. Loads of coal from the Delaware and Hudson Canal came down the river from Rondout Landing near Kingston, NY and were transferred from barges to train cars at the long dock. In 1888, the Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge opened, making the car float operation less useful. In 1905 the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad acquired the ND&C, and in 1907 merged it into the Central New England Railway, part of the NYNH&H system. In 1916 the line to Dutchess Junction was abandoned, leaving only the line into Beacon at the south end.\n\nThe first main line abandonment was from Shekomeko (about halfway from Pine Plains to Millerton) east to Millerton, abandoned in 1925. In 1935 came the abandonment of the part from Shekomeko west to Pine Plains. In 1938 both remaining sections north of Hopewell Junction were abandoned - from the junction north to Pine Plains and from Millerton east to the Connecticut state line.\n\nThe New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad was merged into Penn Central in 1969; by then the former ND&C was known as the Beacon Secondary Track. After the Poughkeepsie Bridge closed in 1974, the former Dutchess County Railroad was abandoned west of Hopewell Junction, and the former ND&C, as well as the former New York and New England Railroad (then the Maybrook Line), became the Danbury Secondary Track. Conrail acquired Penn Central in 1976, including the remaining part of the HD&C. The remaining part of the line from Hopewell Junction to Beacon is now owned by the Metro-North Railroad as part of its Beacon Line.\n\nStations along original D&C line are shaded in darker gray.\n\n\n"}

The Storm used the largest V12 engine fitted to a production road car since World War II, a 7.0 L Jaguar unit based on the one used in the Jaguar XJR-9 that competed at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Due to the high price of the vehicle at £220,000, only four examples were produced before production of the road-going Storm ceased. Only three Storms survive today, although the company continues to maintain racing models. The Storm was the fastest four-seat grand tourer during the 1990s and early 2000s.\nThe bored and stroked two-valve V12 engine generated a maximum power output of at 6,100 rpm and of torque at 3,450 rpm. The car weighed , and was capable of accelerating from 0– in 4.1 seconds.\n\nThe Lister Storm GTS debuted at the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans as a competitor in the GT1 class, going up against cars such as the McLaren F1 GTR, Ferrari F40 LM, Jaguar XJ220S, and the Porsche 911 GT2. The car, driven by Geoff Lees, Rupert Keegan, and Dominic Chappell, did not perform well, failing to finish due to gearbox failure after 40 laps.\n\nIn 1996, the team decided to give the Storm an early test for Le Mans by entering a lone Storm in the 24 Hours of Daytona but failed to finish. Even with this letdown, the team pushed on towards Le Mans with the Storm GTS. The car was able to improve on its disappointing start by finishing the race in 1996, although the car finished in 19th place, 59 laps behind the winner. Lister decided after Le Mans that they would enter the Storm GTS into the BPR Global GT Series, debuting in the fifth round at the Nürburgring. The car was then entered at the Suzuka 1000km. Every race that the Storm GTS entered for the rest of the season failed to result in a finish.\n\nFor 1997, Lister realized that the Storm GTS was too slow in comparison to some of the newer GT1 class competitors, such as the Mercedes-Benz CLK GTR and Porsche 911 GT1. The Storm was therefore redesigned, with a longer and more aerodynamic front end added to the existing car. This car was referred to as the Storm GTL. The car debuted at the 24 Hours of Daytona, where it managed to take 19th place overall and fourth in its class. Later that year, for Le Mans, two new Storm GTLs were entered, but neither of them was able to finish, with both cars out of the race by lap 77. Later in the year, a Storm GTL would travel to the United States to participate in the final two rounds of the FIA GT Championship at Sebring and Laguna Seca. The car failed to finish both races.\n\n1998 saw the team again attempt Daytona, but again they suffered problems early on, and did not finish. With these difficulties, the team was not selected for entry in that year's 24 Hours of Le Mans, and the team did not compete anymore that year, the team instead concentrating on redesigning the Storm.\n\nFor 1999, the Storm reappeared. The car had lost the aerodynamic bodywork seen on the GTL, instead using a more stock front end. The team announced they would participate in the full FIA GT Championship season under the new GT2 class rules. After a poor start, the team managed to take fourth place at Hockenheimring, a mere two laps behind the winning pair of Chrysler Viper GTS-Rs. This was followed by a third place at Zolder, and finally, a second place at Donington, with the Lister finishing a mere 26 seconds behind the winning Viper. These successes brought Lister into a tie for fifth place overall in the teams championship at the season's end.\n\nGoing into 2000, Lister was more upbeat about their possibilities. Chrysler-Oreca had officially left the championship, eliminating a challenge from a factory team. Thus, Lister would face competition only from privateers. With this, Lister proved their capabilities by winning the first race of the season at Valencia. Lister would follow this up with four more wins during the season, all claimed by drivers Julian Bailey and Jamie Campbell-Walter. With these victories, Lister claimed the teams championship. At the same time, Lister competed in the British GT championship both as a factory team, as well as with a customer car for Cirtek Motorsport. The two teams were able to take nine victories.\n\nReturning as champions to FIA GT, Lister continued into 2001 with two factory cars. Although Lister was able to take four victories over the year, the team had to settle for third in the teams championship, being beaten by Larbre Competition and Carsport Holland's privateer Vipers. A similar situation occurred in 2002, with Lister managing three victories but only able to take second in the teams championship, again beaten by Larbre.\n\nIn 2003, Lister was joined in FIA GT with a customer Storm, run by Creation Autosportif. The Lister factory team managed only a single win, yet were still able to take second place in the teams championship. Creation was not far behind, with a fourth-place finish in the championship, after gaining a second customer Storm. At the same time, Lister began work on a new project, the Storm LMP which would bring the marque back to Le Mans. This was, therefore, the beginning of the decline of the Storm GT.\n\nFor 2004, Creation Autosportif would take over as the main competitor in FIA GT, with the factory squad appearing only at selected races. Creation managed to take only eighth in the teams championship after the team decided to move to Le Mans Prototypes as well, while the factory squad was only able to score a single point all season. Lister would continue to attempt to campaign the car into 2005, but were only able to gather enough points for 10th place in the teams championship. Following 2005, the factory officially retired the cars to concentrate on the Storm LMP.\n\nIn 2006, French squad Red Racing would purchase a Storm for the FFSA GT Championship. The team would make one attempt at the FIA GT Championship, but failed to make it beyond seven laps in the race at Paul Ricard. As of 2007, there were no Storms racing.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2038478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038478", "title": "Hilla von Rebay", "text": "Hilla von Rebay\n\nHildegard Anna Augusta Elisabeth Freiin Rebay von Ehrenwiesen, known as Baroness Hilla von Rebay or simply Hilla Rebay (31 May 1890 – 27 September 1967), was an abstract artist in the early 20th century and co-founder and first director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. She was a key figure in advising Solomon R. Guggenheim to collect non-objective art, a collection that would later form the basis of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum collection. She was also influential in selecting Frank Lloyd Wright to design the current Guggenheim museum, which is now known as a modernist icon in New York City.\n\nHilla von Rebay was born into a German aristocratic family in Strasbourg, Alsace-Lorraine, then part of the German Empire. She was the second child of Baron Franz Josef Rebay von Ehrenwiesen, an officer in the Prussian army, and his wife, Antonie von Eicken. She showed an early aptitude for art and she studied at the Cologne Kunstgewerbeschule during the academic year 1908/09. She then attended the Académie Julian in Paris from 1909 until 1910, where she received traditional training in landscape, portraiture, genre and history painting. Under the influence of the German \"Jugendstil\" painter Fritz Erler, Rebay moved to Munich in 1910 where she lived until 1911. Here, she began to develop her interest in modern art.\n\nInvited by Dr. Arnold Fortlage, Rebay participated in her first exhibition at the Cologne \"Kunstverein\" in 1912. Fortlage was the author of the foreword to the 1911 Ferdinand Hodler exhibition in Munich, which inspired Rebay greatly to pursue her interest in modern art.\n\nIn March 1913, Rebay was exhibited alongside Archipenko, Brâncuși, Chagall, Robert Delaunay, Gleizes, Diego Rivera and at the Salon des Indépendants in Paris. This experience, however, was disheartening for Rebay, who seemed to judge her own work as inadequate. In 1915, Rebay met Hans (Jean) Arp in Zurich. This meeting was extremely influential upon Rebay's artistic taste, since it was through Arp that she was introduced to the non-objective modern art works of Kandinsky, Klee, Franz Marc, Chagall and Rudolf Bauer. At this time, Rebay was also introduced to Herwarth Walden and the avant-garde Galerie Der Sturm in Berlin.\n\nIn January 1927, Rebay immigrated to the United States and settled in New York City. An avid art collector, she became a friend and confidante of Solomon R. Guggenheim, and helped advise his art purchases. In particular, she encouraged him to purchase non-objective art by Rudolf Bauer and Kandinsky.\nThese purchases later founded the basis of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation's Museum of Non-Objective Painting, which opened in 1939 in a showroom located at 24 East 54th Street. The first exhibition, entitled \"Art of Tomorrow\", opened on June 1, 1939. Rebay served as the director of the museum until 1952. The next director was James Johnson Sweeney, who had previously been a curator at the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nIn June 1943, Rebay wrote to the noted architect Frank Lloyd Wright to commission a \"museum-temple\" to house the growing collection. While the new museum was being designed, the Museum of Non-Objective Painting moved to a townhouse located at 1071 Fifth Avenue, the intended location of the new building, where Rebay continued to organize exhibitions. When ground was finally broken in 1956, the collection was temporarily moved to a townhouse at 7 East 72nd Street. The new museum opened on October 21, 1959, as the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.\n\nRebay was acknowledged to have excellent taste in modern art. She continued to paint and achieved some recognition for her abstract works. Although she was long a confidante to Solomon Guggenheim, others in the family found her personally difficult, especially his niece Peggy. After Solomon Guggenheim died in 1949, the family expelled her from the board of directors.\n\nWhen the museum was completed, Rebay was not invited for the opening. She never set foot in the museum she helped create. Embittered, Rebay retreated from public life and spent her final years at her estate in Westport, Connecticut.\n\nAfter her death in 1967, she was buried according to her wishes in her family grave in Teningen, Germany.\n\nFollowing Rebay's death in 1967, part of her extensive personal collection of art was given to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum as the \"Hilla Rebay Collection\", which includes works by artists such as Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Albert Gleizes and Kurt Schwitters.\nIn 2012 a Hilla von Rebay Association was founded in Teningen dedicated to the memory of Rebay and her work. It operates a museum in her parents' house, which they purchased in 1919 and which she donated to Teningen after their deaths, with the request that it be used for a good purpose.\n\n\nReferences\n"}

He commanded two expeditions (1501–02 and 1503–04) which explored much of the coast of Brazil.\n\nIn 1501 Coelho was sent on an expedition to follow up on Pedro Álvares Cabral's discovery of Brazil. On 10 May, he sailed from Lisbon as \"Captain General\" of three caravels. Among his crew was a Florentine resident in Seville, Amerigo Vespucci. On 17 August his expedition made landfall off the Brazilian coast at about 5° S. The fleet continued south, reaching Guanabara Bay (23° S) on New Year's Day 1502, naming it \"Rio de Janeiro\". They sailed two degrees further south (reaching modern Cananéia), before leaving Brazil on 13 February 1502. If Amerigo Vespucci`s account is to be believed, the expedition reached the latitude \"South Pole elevation 52° [S]\", in the \"cold\" latitudes of present-day Patagonia, reaching \"inhospitable seas and shores\" (or \"islands\"), before turning back, but this is still a matter of controversy. Only one of the three caravels returned to Lisbon, arriving there on 7 September, 1502.\n\nCoelho again sailed from Lisbon on 10 May 1503, this time with a fleet of six sail. Vespucci once more accompanied him, now as captain of one of the ships. After stopping at the Cape Verde Islands the ships came to \"an island in the midst of the sea\" (probably Fernando de Noronha), where the flagship struck a reef and wrecked on 10 August. All the men were saved, being loaded into Vespucci's ship. They found a harbor, where they rendezvoused with one of the fleet. They then sailed to Brazil, arriving there in November at a bay they named \"Todos os Santos\" (today Baía de Todos os Santos). After waiting here in vain for the rest of the fleet, they sailed south to another bay, where they stayed for five months, building a fort and loading logwood. They left twenty-four men at the fort to load more logwood, and sailed for Lisbon, which they reached on 28 June 1504.\n"}

It is otherwise known as the balaya, tongkol, arctic bonito, mushmouth, oceanic bonito, striped tuna, or victor fish. It grows up to 1 m (3 ft) in length. It is a cosmopolitan pelagic fish found in tropical and warm-temperate waters. It is a very important species for fisheries.\n\nIt is a streamlined, fast-swimming pelagic fish, common in tropical waters throughout the world, where it inhabits surface waters in large shoals (up to 50,000 fish), feeding on fish, crustaceans, cephalopods, and molluscs. It is an important prey species for sharks and large pelagic fishes and is often used as live bait when fishing for Marlin. It has no scales, except on the lateral line and the corselet (a band of large, thick scales forming a circle around the body behind the head). It commonly reaches fork lengths up to and a weight of . Its maximum fork length is and maximum weight is . Ageing skipjack tuna is difficult, and the estimates of its potential lifespan range between 8 and 12 years.\n\nSkipjack tuna is a batch spawner. Spawning occurs year-round in equatorial waters, but it gets more seasonal further away from the equator. Fork length at first spawning is about . It is also known for its potent smell.\n\nIt is an important commercial and game fish, usually caught using purse seine nets, and is sold fresh, frozen, canned, dried, salted, and smoked. With reported landings of almost 2.6 million tonnes, it was second only to the Peruvian anchoveta as the world's most important captured fish species in 2009.\nCountries recording large amounts of skipjack catches include the Maldives, France, Spain, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia.\n\nSkipjack is the most fecund of the main commercial tunas, and its population is considered sustainable against its current consumption. Its fishing is still controversial due to the methodology, with rod and reel or fishery options being promoted as ecologically preferable. \nPurse seine methods are considered unsustainable by some authorities due to excess bycatch, although bycatch is said to be much reduced if fish aggregation devices are not used. These considerations have led to the availability of canned skipjack marked with the fishing method used to catch it.\n\nSkipjack is considered to have \"moderate\" mercury contamination. As a result, pregnant women are advised against eating large quantities. In addition, skipjack's livers were tested globally for tributyltin contamination. TBT is an organotin compound introduced into marine ecosystems through antifouling paint used on ship hulls, and has been determined to be very toxic. About 90% of skipjack tested positive for contamination, especially in Southeast Asia, where regulations of TBT use are less rigorous than in Europe or the US.\n\nSkipjack tuna is used extensively in Japanese cuisine, where it is known as . Besides being eaten seared () and raw in sushi and sashimi, it is also smoked and dried to make katsuobushi, the central ingredient in dashi (a common Japanese fish stock). It is also a key ingredient in shuto.\n\nIn Indonesian cuisine, skipjack tuna is known as \"cakalang\". The most popular Indonesian dish made from skipjack tuna is \"cakalang fufu\" from Minahasa. It is a cured and smoked skipjack tuna dish, made by cooking the fish after clipping it to a bamboo frame. Skipjack known as Kalhubilamas in Maldives is integral to Maldivian cuisine.\n\nSkipjack tuna is an important fish in the Native cuisine of Hawaii (where it is known as \"aku\") and throughout the Pacific islands. Hawaiians prefer to eat \"aku\" either raw as a \"sashimi\" or \"poke\" or seared like in the Japanese \"tataki\" style.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2038513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038513", "title": "Flow control structure", "text": "Flow control structure\n\nA flow control structure is a device that alters the flow of water in a stream, drainage channel or pipe. As a group these are passive structures since they operate without intervention under different amounts of water flow and their impact changes based on the quantity of water available. This includes weirs, flow splitters and proprietary-design devices that are used for stormwater management and in combined sewers.\n\nFlow-control structures are known to have existed for thousands of years. Some built by the Chinese have been in continuous use for over 2,000 years. The Chinese used these structures to divert water to irrigate fields and to actually deposit silt in specific areas so that the channels were not blocked by silt build-up. Structures like this required yearly maintenance to remove the accumulated silt.\n\nMore modern structures add to these basic principles. In Hawaii, there are numerous flow-control structures that have been built to irrigate the pineapple and sugar cane fields. The purpose of these structures is to divert water into the various canals and to keep them full. When over full, they dump excess water back into either streams or other canals. Among the simplest is a low dam across a shallow stream, forcing all of the water to one side to allow it to be easily collected in a canal. This can keep a canal full even with very low flows in a stream.\n\nAnother simple device is a series of concrete piers installed in a spillway to slow down the descending water so that it does not cause damage at the bottom of the spillway.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2038519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038519", "title": "Citi Field", "text": "Citi Field\n\nCiti Field is a baseball park located in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in New York City. Completed in 2009, it is the home field of the New York Mets of the National League division of Major League Baseball. The stadium was built as a replacement for the adjacent Shea Stadium, which opened in 1964 next to the site of the 1964 New York World's Fair.\n\nCiti Field was designed by Populous (then HOK Sport), and is named after Citigroup, a New York financial services company which purchased the naming rights. The $850 million baseball park was funded with $615 million in public subsidies, including the sale of New York City municipal bonds which are to be repaid by the Mets plus interest. The payments will offset property taxes for the lifetime of the park. The Mets are receiving $20 million annually from Citibank in exchange for naming the stadium Citi Field.\n\nThe first game at Citi Field was on March 29, 2009, with a college baseball game between St. John's and Georgetown. The Mets played their first two games at the ballpark on April 3 and 4, 2009 against the Boston Red Sox as charity exhibition games. The first regular season home game was played on April 13, 2009, against the San Diego Padres. Citi Field hosted the 2013 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, marking the second time the Mets have hosted the event (the first being in 1964, the inaugural season of Shea Stadium).\n\nSince the 1990s, the Mets were looking to replace Shea Stadium. It had originally been built as a multi-purpose stadium in 1964. While it had been retrofitted as a baseball-only stadium after the NFL's New York Jets left for Giants Stadium after the 1983 season, it was still not optimal for baseball, with seating located farther away from the playing field compared to other major league ballparks. The team unveiled a preliminary model of the ballpark in 1998; it featured a retractable roof and a movable grass field, which would have allowed it to host events including conventions and college basketball. The Mets also considered moving to Mitchel Field or Belmont Park in Nassau County, Long Island; Sunnyside Yard in Queens, or the West Side Yard in Manhattan.\n\nIn December 2001, shortly before leaving office, New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani announced \"tentative agreements\" for both the Mets and the New York Yankees to build new stadiums. Of the $1.6 billion sought for the stadiums, city and state taxpayers would pick up half the tab for construction, $800 million, along with $390 million on extra transportation. The plan also said that the teams would be allowed to keep all parking revenues, which state officials had already said they wanted to keep to compensate the state for building new garages for the teams. The teams would keep 96% of ticket revenues and 100% of all other revenues, not pay sales tax or property tax on the stadium, and would get low-cost electricity from New York state. Business officials criticized the plan as giving too much money to successful teams with little reason to move to a different city.\n\nMichael Bloomberg, who succeeded Giuliani as mayor, exercised the escape clause in the agreements to back out of both deals, saying that the city could not afford to build new stadiums for the Mets and Yankees. Bloomberg said that, unbeknownst to him, Giuliani had inserted a clause in this deal which loosened the teams' leases with the city and would allow the Mets and Yankees to leave the city on 60 days notice to find a new home elsewhere if the city backed out of the agreement. At the time, Bloomberg said that publicly funded stadiums were a poor investment. Under Bloomberg, the New York City government would only offer public financing for infrastructure improvements; the teams would have to pay for the stadiums themselves. Bloomberg called the former mayor's agreements \"corporate welfare.\" Giuliani had already been instrumental in the construction of taxpayer-funded minor league baseball facilities MCU Park for the Mets' minor league Brooklyn Cyclones and Richmond County Bank Ballpark for the Staten Island Yankees.\n\nThe final plans for what is now Citi Field were created as part of the unsuccessful New York City 2012 Olympic bid. After plans for a West Side Stadium fell through, New York looked for an alternate stadium to host the opening and closing ceremonies and track and field. The Olympic Stadium project on the West Side was estimated to cost $2.2 billion, with $300 million provided by New York City and an additional $300 million from New York State. If New York had won the bid, Citi Field would have been expanded to Olympic events while the Mets would have played at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx for the 2012 season.\n\nThe projected cost of the new ballpark and other infrastructure improvements is $610 million, with the Mets picking up $420 million of that amount. The agreement includes a 40-year lease that will keep the Mets in New York until 2049. The Mets own the stadium through a wholly owned subsidiary, Queens Ballpark Company.\n\nOn March 18, 2006, the New York Mets unveiled the official model for the new ballpark. By July 2006, initial construction of the new park was underway in the parking lot beyond Shea Stadium's left-field, with a projected finish of late March ahead of Opening Day 2009.\n\nBy April 13, 2008, all of the structure for the Jackie Robinson Rotunda was in place with the arched windows receiving their paneling and glass. By September 2008, most of the Citi Field signage had been installed. By December 1, 2008, all of the seats and the playing field had been installed.\n\nDuring the 2010 off-season, the bullpen area in right-center field underwent a complete renovation. When the edifice opened in time for the start of the 2009 MLB season, the Mets' bullpen was in front of the visiting bullpen, leading to an obstructed view of the field from the visiting bullpen, which the San Diego Padres complained about during the Mets' first regular-season home series. The bullpens were turned 90°, with pitchers throwing toward the field instead of parallel to it. More Mets team colors, player banners and logos were also added throughout the ballpark, including revamping the \"Let's Go Mets\" slogan on the Citi Vision board so that the word \"Mets\" appears in its traditional script instead of the same font as the rest of the slogan. Additionally, the height of the home run boundary line directly in front of the Home Run Apple in center field was reduced from to in an attempt to produce more home runs.\n\nDuring its first three seasons, the large field dimensions caused Citi Field to play as an extreme \"pitcher's park\", and home-runs at the stadium were among the fewest in the Major Leagues. Mets' general manager Sandy Alderson changed Citi Field's dimensions in time for the 2012 MLB season in order to make it more friendly to hitters. Changes included building an wall in front of the high wall in left field that many had dubbed the \"Great Wall of Flushing\", removing the nook in the \"Mo's Zone\" in right field, and reducing the distance in right center field from from home plate to . The new walls are colored blue in order to address fan complaints that the old black walls with orange trims did not reflect the colors of the Mets. The Mets have also created a new seating section located in between the old and new left field walls called the Party City Party Deck, renamed the M&M's Sweet Seats in 2016 after change of sponsorship, and can accommodate 102 additional fans.\n\nThe center and right-center outfield wall were brought in to for the 2015 season.\n\nOn March 21, 2019, the Mets announced on Twitter that Citi Field's permanent address will be changed to 41 Seaver Way, in honor of former Mets Hall of Fame pitcher Tom Seaver whose number was 41. The ceremony was held on June 27, 2019 and was part of the weekend set aside for celebrating the 50th anniversary of the 1969 World Series Champion Mets.\n\nCiti Field has a capacity of 41,922. It has over 15,000 fewer seats than Shea Stadium. All the seats in the park are green – in an homage to the Polo Grounds, longtime home of the baseball Giants and the original home of the Mets – as opposed to Shea's orange, blue, red and green assortment. The exterior facade is reminiscent of Ebbets Field (which was long sought by Mets owner Fred Wilpon, a Brooklyn native).\n\nCiti Field's interior design is primarily influenced by the Pittsburgh Pirates' PNC Park, which was the favorite ballpark of Mets COO Jeff Wilpon. Other influences include Great American Ball Park, Coors Field, and Citizens Bank Park. Shea Stadium was the only ballpark in the Major League Baseball to feature orange foul poles instead of the standard yellow, a unique characteristic that carried over from Shea Stadium.\n\nCiti Field features an overarching bridge motif in its architecture, as New York City is linked by 2,027 bridges and is reflected in the Mets logo, as the team is the symbolic bridge to the city's past National League teams, the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Dodgers. In the outfield section of the ballpark, there is a pedestrian bridge named Shea Bridge which resembles the Hell Gate Bridge.\n\nSimilar to Shea Stadium, Citi Field's field dimensions ensure it is a pitcher-friendly park. The Coca-Cola Corner, originally known as the Pepsi Porch, hangs over the field in right field, extending far beyond the indentation of the Clubhouse and is inspired by Tiger Stadium's right field porch. The Pepsi sign that sat atop the area (2009-2015) was modeled after the one alongside the East River in Gantry Plaza State Park; it was replaced by Coca-Cola's logo in 2016 upon assuming the role of a Mets sponsor.\n\nIn 2012, the Mets added the Party City Party Deck in left field because they moved the fences in. The Party Deck is very similar to The Royals' Pepsi Party Porch.\n\nDelta Air Lines signed a multiyear deal on September 15, 2008, to sponsor an exclusive section in Citi Field. The Delta Sky360 Club is a restaurant-cafe-bar-lounge complex that also houses 1,600 premium seats behind home plate stretching from dugout to dugout.\n\nThe front entrance of Citi Field features a rotunda named after Brooklyn Dodgers legend Jackie Robinson and honors his life and accomplishments. Engraved into the rotunda's floor and etched into the archways are words and larger-than-life images that defined Robinson's nine values: Courage, Excellence, Persistence, Justice, Teamwork, Commitment, Citizenship, Determination and Integrity.\n\nRobinson's famous quote: \"A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives\" is engraved into the upper ring of the rotunda. There is also an sculpture of Robinson's number 42. The formal dedication of the Jackie Robinson Rotunda was held as part of Major League Baseball's official celebration of Jackie Robinson Day on April 15, 2009.\n\nAnother tradition from Shea Stadium carried over into Citi Field is the Home Run Apple. When a Mets player hits a home run, a giant apple, which has a Mets logo on the front that lights up, rises from its housing in the center field batter's eye. The new apple that was constructed for Citi Field is more than four times the size of the previous one and was designed by Minneapolis-based engineering firm Uni-Systems.\n\nDuring the 2009 season, the original Shea apple was located in Bullpen Plaza, just inside the Bullpen Gate entrance. In 2010, it was relocated outside the ballpark in Mets Plaza to the area between the Jackie Robinson Rotunda and the entrance to the Mets–Willets Point subway station.\n\nBehind the center field scoreboard is the FanFest area, an expanded family entertainment area that includes a miniature wiffleball field replica of Citi Field called Mr. Met's Kiddie Field, a batting cage, a dunk tank, video game kiosks and other attractions.\n\nCiti Field offers a wide choice of eateries. \"Taste of the City\" is a food court located in the center field section of the ballpark. It features food from restaurateur Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group and includes a variety of stands, including Shake Shack (burgers, fries, shakes), Blue Smoke (barbecue), El Verano Taqueria (Mexican cuisine), Catch of the Day (featuring seafood from chef Dave Pasternack of Esca), and Box Frites (Belgian French fries). The World's Fare Market is located on the field level in right field and features sushi from Daruma of Tokyo, sandwiches and pastries from Mama's of Corona, Chinese cuisine from Tai Pan Bakery and Korean food from Café Hanover. Citi Field also offers a choice of fresh fruit at several stands around the stadium. In 2010 Citi Field upgraded the food choices on the Promenade Level behind home plate. Blue Smoke BBQ and Box Frites both open a second location.\n\nRestaurants and clubs are also available in every level of the ballpark. The 350-seat Acela Club (now Porsche Grill) located in left field on the Excelsior Level, is the dining highlight of the new park and features a full view of the playing field as well as food from Drew Nieporent's Myriad Restaurant Group, renowned for Nobu and Tribeca Grill. Admission into the high-end luxury Porsche Grill and Delta Sky360 Club, and including the other semi-luxury clubs are exclusive to high-end ticket holders only, and some restaurants enforce that reservations be made. A McFadden's Restaurant and Saloon opened at Citi Field in 2010. It is located directly under the Good Humor FanFest and is open to the public year-round.\nThe Mets Hall of Fame & Museum is located adjacent to the Jackie Robinson Rotunda on the first base side and opened on April 5, 2010. The museum includes plaques honoring the inductees of the New York Mets Hall of Fame, the team's World Series trophies from and , as well as artifacts on loan from noted collectors, former players and the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.\nThe museum boasts several displays including autographed memorabilia, original scouting reports on players such as Darryl Strawberry, and handwritten notes from the team's first manager Casey Stengel. In addition to this the team has installed interactive touchscreens, television screens, and timelines that guide visitors through various aspects of the franchise's history.\n\n\"Business Insider\" praised the stadium for its aesthetics and named it one of the top 100 venues in sports, while BaseballParks.com called it \"perfect\" and especially lauded the Jackie Robinson Rotunda. Reviewers have also praised the many culinary offerings at Citi Field's concession stands.\n\nDespite the modern amenities, Citi Field has not been without criticism. Fans have complained of obstructed views, and overemphasis on the celebration of the Brooklyn Dodgers' legacy over the history of the Mets. Mets owner Fred Wilpon, a Brooklyn native, had grown up a Brooklyn Dodgers fan and admitted to going overboard. Legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin wrote in \"The New Yorker\", \n\nIn response to these criticisms, the team installed photographic imagery of famous players and historic moments in Mets history on the Field and Promenade levels as well as the display of team championship banners on the left-field wall during the 2009 season. They also constructed a Mets Hall of Fame and Museum prior to the 2010 season, located adjacent to the Jackie Robinson Rotunda, and changed the color of the outfield wall from black to Mets blue prior to the 2012 season, which many Mets fans had campaigned for. The team also worked on fixing the obstructed views in the Promenade level.\n\nDuring its first three seasons in existence, Citi Field was known to play as a \"pitcher's park\", and has been cited as the cause of the decreased offensive production of David Wright and Jason Bay. Wright hit only 10 home runs in 2009 after hitting at least 30 in the previous two seasons, while Bay had the worst offensive production of his career in his first season with the Mets in 2010, only hitting 6 home runs, 47 RBIs, and OBP of just .347, and a slugging percentage of a career-low .402. Jeff Francoeur, who played with the Mets during their first two years at Citi Field, criticized the ballpark's dimensions, calling it \"a damn joke.\" During the 2011 season, Citi Field allowed 1.33 home runs per game, the third lowest total out of the 16 National League ballparks. The team responded by altering the ballpark dimensions for the 2012 season, creating a more neutral ballpark. Wright's 2012 offensive numbers have improved due to the alterations. \"It's a huge difference\", Wright said. \"It allows you to relax and know you don't have to try to hit the ball a mile to see results. And at the same time, if you do hit the ball well and you see results, instead of a flyout, you're 1-for-1 and feeling good about yourself.\"\n\nCiti Field is located in the borough of Queens, adjacent to the neighborhoods of Corona, which lies to its west, and Willets Point and Flushing to the east. Flushing Bay is to the north, and the rest of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park is to the south. Because it lies within the Flushing postal zone, and because of its location in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, Citi Field is frequently referred to as being in Flushing proper.\n\nCiti Field is accessible via the New York City Subway via the IRT Flushing Line () at the Mets–Willets Point station, and the Long Island Rail Road station on the Port Washington Branch also called Mets–Willets Point. New York Water Taxi operates a free ferry to the stadium from Pier 11/Wall Street and the East 34th Street Ferry Landing before every game. For selected games, SeaStreak provides ferry service between Highlands, New Jersey and the stadium. Both ferry services use the slips at the World's Fair Marina, located approximately north of Citi Field. The park is also close to several major thoroughfares, including the Grand Central Parkway, the Whitestone and Van Wyck Expressways, the Long Island Expressway, Roosevelt Avenue, Northern Boulevard and Astoria Boulevard.\n\nCiti Field is near to the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, where the annual US Open grand-slam tennis tournament is held.\n\nSince the construction of Citi Field began, satellite parking lots in Flushing Meadow Park (access from College Point Boulevard) have been opened.\n\nBold indicates the winner of each game.\n\nBold indicates the winner of each game.\n\nBold indicates the winner of each game.\n\nOn November 13, 2006, it was announced that the ballpark would be called Citi Field, named for Citigroup Inc. Citigroup will be paying $20 million a year for the naming rights to the park over the next 20 years. This made Citi Field the second major league sports venue in the New York metropolitan area and the first in the city itself to be named for a corporate sponsor. At the time, the Meadowlands Arena in New Jersey's Meadowlands Sports Complex had carried the Continental Airlines name; since then Prudential Center in Newark, MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, Red Bull Arena in Harrison, and Barclays Center in Brooklyn have all opened under corporate sponsorship. The deal includes an option on both sides to extend the contract to 40 years, and is the most expensive sports-stadium naming rights agreement ever, subsequently equaled by MetLife Stadium's $400 million deal.\n\nAt the groundbreaking for Citi Field, it was announced that the main entrance, modeled on the one in Brooklyn's old Ebbets Field, would be called the Jackie Robinson Rotunda, possibly due to campaigns to forgo naming rights revenue and name the ballpark after Robinson. The Mets are spending more than $600 million for the new ballpark, which New York City and New York state are also supporting with a total of $165 million for such costs as infrastructure and site preparation. On February 24, 2008, the Mets and Citigroup unveiled the new Citi Field logo.\n\nBoth Citigroup and the Mets maintain that the naming rights deal is secure, despite Citigroup's economic troubles. This deal has been criticized in light of the late-2000s financial crisis and the $45 billion of taxpayer funds allocated to Citigroup by the U.S. federal government in two separate rescue packages, prompting New York City Council members Vincent Ignizio and James Oddo to suggest that the new ballpark be called \"Citi/Taxpayer Field.\" Radio talk show host Brian Lehrer suggested the name \"Debits Field\" which combines baseball history with public outrage over the Citi bailout. Congressman Elijah Cummings of Maryland, who serves on the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, stated in regards to the Citi Field naming rights deal, \"This type of spending is indefensible and unacceptable to Citigroup's new partner and largest investor: the American taxpayer... I strongly urge Citigroup to find a way out of this contract and instead spend that $400 million on retaining its employees and restoring confidence in its operations.\" On January 29, 2009, congressmen Dennis Kucinich of Ohio and Ted Poe of Texas sent a letter to United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy F. Geithner urging him to scrap Citigroup's $400 million naming rights deal. \"We request that you intervene and demand that Citigroup dissolve the agreement they have with the New York Mets,\" reads the letter. \"Absent this outcome, we feel strongly that you should compel Citigroup to return immediately all federal monies received to date, as well as cancel all loan guarantees.\" However, Geithner rejected congressional demands to cancel the naming rights deal.\n\n\"The Wall Street Journal\" reported on February 3, 2009, that Citigroup considered breaking the naming rights deal. Citi has stated that no government TARP funds would be used in the sponsorship deal.\n\nThe naming rights controversy reemerged when details about owner Fred Wilpon's involvement in Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme came to light when a lawsuit was filed on behalf of victims of Madoff's investment scandal in 2011.\n\n\nBetween 2012 and 2016, the Mets had a post-game concert series entitled \"Mets Concert Series\" after selected games. Unlike the concerts where the performance was the sole attraction of the evening, \"Mets Concert Series\" events were considered promotional dates, and admission to the concert was included in the price of the game ticket. The stage was set up in the grassy part of the field just beyond second base.\n\n2012\nJune 15, 2012 – REO Speedwagon (following game v. Cincinnati)\nJuly 20, 2012 – Daughtry (following game v.

In 1971, Navy played Johns Hopkins at the Houston Astrodome. Holy Cross played Navy at noon, followed by Colgate-Michigan at 3 p.m. Holy Cross defeated Navy 7–5 and Colgate defeated Michigan 10–7, before a crowd of 15,656.\n\nOn June 7, 2015, the first \"Legends of Wrestling\" event took place at Citi Field. It was a professional wrestling event, featuring veteran wrestlers such as Rob Van Dam, Lita, The Nasty Boys, Scott Steiner, and many more independent professional wrestlers, in up to six matches taking place; the event was headlined by Ric Flair, Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart, and Bill Goldberg.\n\nOn November 7, 2015, Citi Field hosted the first game of the Cricket All-Stars Series 2015, featuring many retired cricket players from around the world and led by great cricket legends Sachin Tendulkar and Shane Warne. Warne's Warriors defeated Sachin's Blasters by 6 wickets.\n\nOn January 1, 2018, Citi Field hosted the 2018 NHL Winter Classic between the New York Rangers and the Buffalo Sabres. The Rangers won the game in overtime, 3–2. The Sabres were the designated home team for the game, as the Rangers' home arena of Madison Square Garden would lose its property tax exemption from the City of New York if any Rangers home games are not played there. Following the Winter Classic, Citi Field, with the help of Recycle Track Systems, the waste, recycling, and sustainability partner of the Mets, was able to recycle the hockey rink that was used during the game.\n\nOn November 16, 2019, Citi Field hosted the New York Hurling Classic—a one-day hurling tournament featuring Limerick, Kilkenny, Tipperary, and Wexford for the Players Champions Cup—which was won by Kilkenny.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2038545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038545", "title": "Georg von der Marwitz", "text": "Georg von der Marwitz\n\nGeorg Cornelius Adalbert von der Marwitz (7 July 1856 – 27 October 1929) was a Prussian cavalry general, who commanded several German armies during the First World War on both the Eastern and Western fronts.\n\nMarwitz was born in Stolp (Słupsk) in the Province of Pomerania and entered the Prussian Army in 1875. In 1881 he married Helene von Kameke, daughter of Prussian War Minister Georg von Kameke, with whom he had five children. From 1883 to 1886 he attended the Prussian Military Academy. Until 1900 he commanded a cavalry regiment, at which point he became chief of staff of XVIII Corps. Before the outbreak of the First World War he was the Inspector-General of Cavalry.\n\nMarwitz was assigned to the Western Front in 1914 as commander of II Cavalry Corps, and participated in the Battle of Haelen. After this first battle Marwitz was transferred to the Eastern Front to take command of the newly formed XXXVIII Reserve Corps, which he led in the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes in the early winter of 1915. He was then transferred south and fought with Austria-Hungary against the Russians and was awarded the Pour le Mérite on 7 March 1915.\n\nAfter recovering from an illness in the fall of 1915, Marwitz served on the Western Front as the commander of the VI Corps, before returning to the Eastern Front until the successful halting of the Russian Brusilov Offensive in June 1916. On 6 October 1916 he became adjutant to Kaiser Wilhelm II, a post that he left in December 1916 to take command of the Second Army on the Western Front.\n\nThe German Army formed along the Siegfried-Stellung line to Havrincourt Wood to la Vacquerie; a mile behind was the Hindenbrg Support line. In front lay a strongly fortified line of trenches. Behind the Support Line was yet another system called the Beaurevoir-Masnieres-Marcoing Line. esch system was built with deep concrete bunkers with massed machine-gun cover; in front were 50 yards plus of thick barbwire. The planned Wotan Line to Cambrai, where situated Marwitz's Second Army was never completed. His superior officer was Feld-Marschal Crown Prince Rupprecht, in command of the Army Group. General Marwitz's command was 3 or 4 infantry divisions. As per instructions he sent out patrols into British trenches searching for prisoners. Marwitz thought troop dispositions unchanged when reporting on 18 November 1917. His officers apparently attached no particular significance to the presence of camouflaged tanks in the sector, seen for the first time on November 20. Marwitz, ignoring air reconnaissance of a build-up in the rear, concluded that an attack was unlikely. The Caudry Group however took prisoner testimonies more seriously, being more responsive also to air intelligence.\n\nWhen he first heard of the British tank attack, he was still in bed at the le Cateau HQ. The surprise was disabling to his infantry, exacerbated by cut communication lines. Commanding Northern Group the Crown Prince informed Berlin, who blamed Second Army inattentiveness. But Marwitz was forced to contemplate total withdrawal. The morning of 21 November, Fontaine had already fallen, but the Second Army knew the allied strength and its dispositions. They ordered up Reserves, the 214th, 119th and 3rd Guards Divisions, all from the north Aisne and Flanders. Rupprecht required even more to support Marwitz’s position. Action would fall on Bourlon Ridge, identified by the British as a vital strategic target. But the Germans had already raided Byng's III Corps seizing many prisoners. The massive German build-up around Cambrai should have informed them that the Germans finally took the threat of tank warfare seriously. In this Battle of Cambrai, which saw the most extensive use of tanks to date, more than twice the previous number, as well as new combined arms tactics. As a consequence, the morning of 26 November 1917, Rupprecht and Marwitz planned at le Cateau the first offensive against the British since April 1915. The following afternoon, they were joined by Lieutenant-General von Kuhl, Group Chief of Staff, at a special conference of all Group commanders. Marwitz, who was under pressure from Ludendorff, remained silent, subdued, still reeling and shocked by the unconventional speed of the allied attack. Marwitz's stormtroops destroyed many hundreds of tanks, but the allies had thousands of them. However, by the end of the month, the attack petered out, and the tanks went into winter quarters. Marwitz and staff immediately determined to counter-attack, and they did their best to recover enemy machines. The last day of the tank battle, 1 December, they managed a \"superhuman effort\" to reach hand-to-hand fighting in the trenches. But on December 3, fighting continued, and into 5 December, when bombardments on Marcoing, Nine Wood and Cantaing took place in thick fog. Two days later, a severe blizzard halted the fighting. Of 50,000 German casualties, over 10,000 were taken prisoner. Although it was 7 December, Marwitz's men had run out of ammunition a week earlier, at a time when the enemy's tanks had ground to a halt. Nonetheless this did not prevent Rupprecht from ordering his men onwards.\n\nAt the time of this major allied offensive Marwitz was a highly experienced soldier, sporting a noticeable white moustache. Opposite British III Corps, he held a vital part of the line for the Germans from the town of Albert to Hargicourt, his command opposed both French and British divisions, was composed of three corps and fourteen divisions. However Second Army was a 'paper' strength revealing serious manpower shortages. Its weakness lay in the fact that half the troops were inferior quality. The Germans had become restless, insubordinate, and mutinous. Its ground was not as well defended as it might have come to expect. The isolated positions did not possess deeply dug trenches. The communications were in 1918, permanently under bombardment. The German troops were losing confidence. By 9 August, his commanders advised retreat behind the line of the River Somme. Crown Prince Rupprecht warned only a complete retreat to reform in a stronger position alongside Ninth Army would suffice; but Ludendorff turned down flat any idea of it; the line was to be held at all costs. The Second Army's defeat on 11 August 1918 was attributed to the allied tanks. But OHL blamed Marwitz, and shifted the burden onto his Chief of Staff, Major-General Erich von Tschischwitz. Marwitz's command was subjected to a reorganization with 18th and 9th Armies. The High Command threw every reserve into the Hindenburg Line. The allies meanwhile planned 'masses of manoeuvre' to encircle Marwitz's Second Army from north and south to outflank the town of Montdidier in an elaborate pincer movement.\n\nWhile the allies prepared for everything; Marwitz left much to chance, knowing his forces were over-stretched. One of the strongest positions held by the German forces was the village of Peronne: surrounded by marshes, Marwitz had ordered the destruction of all bridges in the sector. Monash arrived with his Australians on 26 August 1918 to launch and assault over open ground providing every opportunity for Marwitz's men. The attack began on 5 am on 30 August towards the heavily defended town on Mont Saint Quentin. Elite German units in advanced trenches defended the pock-marked trenches. The Kaiser Alexander Regiment held the hilltop with 600 men each in three battalions. A battalion of Australian veterans pushed the Germans out. The Germans had occupied the area since 1916, and Marwitz felt the defeat badly; it was a big dent to morale. The Germans had fought hard against the youthful Australians, but Marwitz's formations were facing attrition. But 2nd Guards Reserve Division and 4th Bavarian Division had long been in the line without relief; desperately tired, hungry, and without 2,800 reinforcements to make full complement. Desertion had become epidemic three battalions of 55 Infantry Regiment had 'melted away'. Marwitz told his diary the attrition was taking its toll. On 24 August, Marwitz had decorated one officer who killed 14 tanks. But tanks generally struck terror in the ranks, who bound grenades together in anticipation; rifles were abandoned for heavy machine-guns, leaving artillery unprotected in the rearguard.\n\nOn 26 August Marwitz summarised his complaints, the men had endured \"unspeakably hard conditions for such a terribly long time\". The rail connections had not been made, disrupted by allied bombing. Air attacks were a problem for Marwitz Second Army: he was a victim himself by an \"army of fliers\", his staff stood with the men; one dud bomb penetrating Staff HQ. Marwitz saw the suffering at first hand for himself. On one day alone 120 bombs fell on Cambrai occupied by Second Army. Marwitz was finally relieved of command on 22 September 1918. Marwitz was promoted to command Fifth Army consisting of nine divisions. He attempted to instill discipline in troops fleeing before allied tanks, \"its just the fear of those things and not their actual effect\", he wrote in his diary entry of 29 September. All along the Meuse-Argonne Front the Franco-American forces made progress north, supported by tanks; the Germans tried to reply with artillery and machine-gun fire proving stiff resistance.\n\nAs the Argonne Offensive rumbled onward, it ground to a halt, with American soldiers refusing to be stopped by withering machine-gun fire. On 3 October, Marwitz drove out to meet forward observation posts. His troops occupied the high ground. The US 1st Army faced an uphill climb from the plain into an area covered by woods, in which \"are built-in machine guns, individual guns, mortars, surveillance posts...\" concealing German troops. American artillery was ineffective. Although despondent, the Germans held their ground grimly. American operations commenced at 5.30 am on 5 October from the east bank of the Meuse, but almost immediately they stalled in dark fog. The tactics had changed, the Germans were cheered by Group, but rumours of a possible peace sapped their morale.\n\nBy 1 November there were barely seven exhausted divisions on an 18 km front at Barricourt Heights. Marwitz's manouevrability was further hampered by shelled out roads and collapsed communications lines cutting off his HQ from front line commanders. Marwitz was in favour of withdrawing Fifth Army behind the relatively safety of the east bank of the Meuse, to re-group and get some rest, but OHL refused, sending strict orders to stand and fight. On 2 November, the Americans achieved real success, sweeping uphill over the German positions, and Marwitz's centre line broke. General Hunter Liggett interpreted this as a weakness that had anticipated an attack on their right flank, but when it came in caused the line to collapse in depth. The capture of Barricount signalled a general rout. Marwitz remained patriotically loyal throughout. He issued an order that the Second Army must fight on, \"The Fatherland Forever\". Despite his unrealistic order, the armies began to disintegrate, at less than half battalions' fighting strength.\n\nOn 10 November, Marwitz left his post on the Meuse and called in to see Gallwitz. He demanded an armistice; the loss of Barricourt Heights, he told the Chief, had been the end. The French had reached Sedan on 6–7 November, and retreating Germans had left behind considerable quantities of equipment.\n\nAfter the war, Marwitz withdrew from public life. He died at Wundichow in 1929 at the age of 73.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2038559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038559", "title": "Waterloo Village, New Jersey", "text": "Waterloo Village, New Jersey\n\nWaterloo Village is a restored 19th-century canal town in Byram Township, Sussex County (west of Stanhope) in northwestern New Jersey, United States. The community was approximately the half-way point in the roughly 102-mile (165 km) trip along the Morris Canal, which ran from Jersey City (across the Hudson River from Manhattan, New York) to Phillipsburg, New Jersey, (across the Delaware River from Easton, Pennsylvania). Waterloo possessed all the accommodations necessary to service the needs of a canal operation, including an inn, a general store, a church, a blacksmith shop (to service the mules on the canal), and a watermill. For canal workers, Waterloo's geographic location would have been conducive to being an overnight stopover point on the two-day trip between Phillipsburg and Jersey City.\n\nIt is currently an open-air museum in Allamuchy Mountain State Park. As part of the State Park, it is open to the public from sunrise to sunset. The village was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 13, 1977.\n\nOpened in 1831, the Morris Canal's traffic volume, which was primarily anthracite coal from Pennsylvania, peaked during the late 1860s, shortly after the end of the American Civil War. Up until that time, the local railroads — the Lackawanna Railroad's Sussex Branch and Morris and Essex Railroad — had only supplemented the canal's operation, rather than competing with it. Both railroads ran within a short distance of the village. After the War, the canal's traffic began to quickly shift over to the much faster and more reliable railroad. It was expected that during most winters the canal would be frozen solid, and thus impassable during the time when its chief commodity was in greatest demand.\n\nAs a result, the canal underwent a steady decline, and so did Waterloo Village. Although the canal was not officially abandoned until 1924, rarely did more than one boat a year (to fulfill the conditions of the canal's charter) run through the canal after 1900. By the time of the Great Depression, Waterloo Village had been abandoned by its original owners.\n\nThe village's location, within a short distance of the Lackawanna Railroad (which had to overcome a steep eastbound grade towards New York near Waterloo, slowing freight trains to a crawl as they labored up the hill to Netcong), made it easy for hobos to jump on and off boxcars.\n\nThe hobos, as it turned out, found Waterloo and adopted it as a stopping off point on their cross-country journey towards New York. This new purpose for the village wasn't all that different from its original purpose a century earlier. The hobos protected Waterloo Village by occupying it throughout the 1930s and '40s. The original Waterloo railroad station was moved from the station site during the 1940s and became a private residence on U.S. Route 206 in Mount Olive Township, New Jersey.\n\nPercival 'Percy' Leach established the not-for-profit Waterloo Foundation for the Arts to finance the restoration of the village in 1967. Leach and his partner in the interior design business Lou Gualandi turned it into a living history tourist attraction with working blacksmiths, potters, candle dippers and weavers demonstrated crafts from the colonial historic eras.\n\nThe village would eventually become part of New Jersey's Allamuchy Mountain State Park.\n\nAdmissions fees being never enough to cover the administrative costs of the attract, the partners sought out corporate and state grants, but ultimately opened an open-air concert field on the property in 1977 to raise funds.\n\nNotable acts who have performed at Waterloo include Muddy Waters, Johnny Cash, the Beach Boys, Steppenwolf, the Allman Brothers, America, Arlo Guthrie, Chicago, Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Indigo Girls, Edie Brickell, Melissa Etheridge, Joe Cocker, The Moody Blues, Blues Traveler, Ray Charles, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, Blue Öyster Cult and three Lollapalooza tours. In addition to pop and rock concerts, Waterloo has also hosted craft shows, ethnic festivals, conventions, Metropolitan Opera, jazz, classical music and the Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry Festival. \n\nFollowing Gualandi's death in 1988, Leach became involved in several controversies that brought greater scrutiny upon the Waterloo Foundation for the Arts. The most controversial was the so-called \"land swap\" that allowed BASF corporation to build a large corporate headquarters on land that had once been part of Allamuchy Mountain State Park. The Waterloo board of directors subsequently brought in a new management team and throughout the mid- to late-1990s tried to rebuild trust in the running of the village.\n\nIn 1995, a concert-goer died at a Phish concert that had attracted 30,000 people even though only 18,000 tickets were sold. Events like this had completely overwhelmed the area's limited access roads and caused considerable friction with the surrounding towns. The foundation began downsizing the concerts around this time. \nIn the period from 2003 to 2006, the Waterloo Foundation for the Arts had received $900,000 from the State of New Jersey for general expenses, along with more than $300,000 since 2000 to cover repairs. As the state showed increasing displeasure with the village's operation, the $250,000 the group had expected to receive, which would have been used towards the $2 million operating budget for the site, was cut from the 2007 state budget. Waterloo Village was shut down in December 2006, except for the privately owned Waterloo United Methodist Church, which has a small but dedicated congregation and continues to operate as it has for over 150 years. In the period beginning in 2006, the Village was only open intermittently.\n\nPercy Leach died in 2007 leaving the organization's future uncertain.\n\nSince the closing, several organizations continued to restore aspects of the village. Friends of Waterloo and the Canal Society focused on \"Canal Town\" while a non profit called Winakung at Waterloo Inc. focused on the sustainability of the Lenape Indian Village.\n\nThrough a concession agreement with the NJDEP Division of Parks and Forestry in 2014, group tours and programs became available at the village by reservation. Winakung at Waterloo Inc. educational programs meet core curriculum standards and are ideal for school trips, scout groups, and summer camp field trips. Winakung at Waterloo Inc. also offers year-round outreach programs for schools, libraries, historical societies, Clean Communities and more.\n\nIn the spring of 2014, a 10-year lease (with the option of 10 more) was awarded to Jeffrey Miller Catering (JAM Catering) out of Philadelphia, making them the exclusive caterer for Waterloo Village. JAM has renovated the Meeting House and Pavilion.\n\nBeginning May 2014, the SMS Italian Festival, an annual Non-Profit event supporting the children of St Michael School, began at the village.\n\nIn May 2017, the stage was demolished to prepare for future festivals and make way for a new stage to be built on the grounds.\n\nThe cornerstone for the Waterloo Village United Methodist Church was set on August 9, 1859 and the church dedicated on February 9, 1860. General John Smith was the first to be buried in the churchyard cemetery.\n\nMuch of the principal photography for writer/director Michael Pleckaitis' silent film \"Silent\" was done in November and December 2006 at various locations in the village.\n\n\n"}

That song (with a music video homage to the film \"King Kong\", featuring Cherrelle as the beast's love interest) was covered about a year later by pop singer Robert Palmer on his 1985 album \"Riptide\". It was also covered by Mariah Carey for her 2001 soundtrack album \"Glitter\" using the same instrumental track.\n\nCherrelle's follow-up album, \"High Priority\", was certified gold and produced the Top 40 hit and the #2 R&B hit \"Saturday Love\"; a duet with Alexander O'Neal, it would also land in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 6. Cherrelle and O'Neal would have another Top 40 single with \"Never Knew Love Like This\", which peaked at #28 US pop in 1988, and #2 R&B. A remixed version of \"Saturday Love\" on Tabu Records reached #55 in the UK Singles Chart in early 1990. Her third album, 1988's \"Affair\", included the Number 1 R&B single, \"Everything I Miss at Home\". The album's title track became another R&B hit, peaking at number 4 on the R&B charts.\n\nFamily members of this legendary pop star include several known names in the music world. Cherrelle's cousin is pop singer Perri \"Pebbles\" Reid; and she is the aunt of Brandi of the girl group Blaque. Cherrelle is also a 1st cousin of Musica Monica Feaster, Music Producer/Gospel Artist. In addition to Cherrelle's musical background, she and Johnny Gill were featured on Pebbles' 1991 single \"Always\", which made the R&B Top 20. That same year, Cherrelle released the album \"The Woman I Am\", a first-time departure from using Jam and Lewis productions. The singer linked with producer Narada Michael Walden (known for working with Whitney Houston). Cherrelle reunited with the producers eight years later with her independent album \"The Right Time\", released in 1999, and featuring a guest appearance from rapper Keith Murray.\n\nCherrelle has a light-lyric soprano vocal range. Her voice has been called a \"light, wispy and occasionally whiny soprano\" which influenced the urban contemporary music markets by Ron Wynn of AllMusic. Cherrelle's \"light and airy soprano\" were considered the inspiration as to why Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis wanted to produce her and showcase her gift to the world. Other critics gave her praise for being able to convey emotions.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2038602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038602", "title": "Agostinho da Silva", "text": "Agostinho da Silva\n\nGeorge Agostinho Baptista da Silva, (; Porto, 13 February 1906 – Lisbon, 3 April 1994) was a Portuguese philosopher, essayist, and writer. His thought combines elements of pantheism and millenarism, an ethic of renunciation (like in Buddhism or Franciscanism), and a belief in freedom as the most important feature of man. Anti-dogmatic, he asserts that truth is only found in the sum of all conflicting hypothesis (in paradox). He may be considered a \"practical philosopher\", living and working for a change in society, according to his beliefs. \n\nHe is part of a tradition of visionary thought that includes Father António Vieira and the poets Luís de Camões and Fernando Pessoa. Like Joachim de Fiore, he speaks of the coming of one (last?) age in History, the Age of the Holy Spirit, in which mankind and society attain perfection. To Agostinho da Silva, this means the absence of economy, brought about by technological evolution, and the absence of government. It also means that the nature of mankind and the nature of God will become the same. In this sense his philosophy is both an eschatology and an utopy. \n\n\"(translated and adapted from: Romana Brázio Valente, \"Agostinho da Silva: Síntese Biográfica\")\"\n\nGeorge Agostinho Baptista da Silva was born in Porto on 1906, and later in the same year moved to Barca d'Alva (Figueira de Castelo Rodrigo), where he lived until about 6 years old. From 1924 to 1928 he takes Classical Philology at the Faculdade de Letras of University of Porto. After graduation he starts writing in the Seara Nova magazine (a collaboration that will continue until 1938).\n\nBy 1931, as a scholarship student, he attends Sorbonne and Collége de France (Paris). Since 1933 he works as a teacher in the Aveiro high school but in 1935 is discharged for refusing to sign a statement (then mandatory to all civil servants) declaring no participation in secret (thus subversive) organizations.\n\nHe creates the Núcleo Pedagógico Antero de Quental in 1939 and in 1940 starts publishing \"Iniciação: cadernos de informação cultural\". Arrested by the secret police in 1943, leaves the country the following year.\n\nHe lived in Brazil, from 1947 to 1969, due to his opposition to the authoritarian regime of the \"Estado Novo\" (New State) led teaches at Faculdade Fluminense de Filosofia and collaborates with Jaime Cortesão in a research about Alexandre de Gusmão (18th century diplomat). From 1952 to 1954, he teaches at Federal University of Paraíba in João Pessoa and also in Pernambuco.\n\nIn 1954, again with Jaime Cortesão, he helps organize the 4th Centennial Exhibition of São Paulo. He was one of the founders of University of Santa Catarina, created the Centro de Estudos Afro-Orientais (Afro-Oriental Studies Center), taught Theater Philosophy at University of Bahia, and, in 1961, became an external policy adviser to the Brazilian president Jânio Quadros. He helped to create the Universidade de Brasília and its Centro de Estudos Portugueses (Portuguese Studies Center), in 1962, and, two years later, he creates the Casa Paulo Dias Adorno in Cachoeira and idealizes the Museu do Atlântico Sul in Salvador.\n\nHe comes back to Portugal in 1969, after Salazar's illness and replacement by Marcello Caetano, which originated some political and cultural opening in the regime. From then on he, among many other things, continued to write, teach at Portuguese universities, direct the Centro de Estudos Latinoamericanos (Latin-American Studies Center) at Technical University of Lisbon, and acted as a consultant to Instituto de Cultura e Língua Portuguesa (ICALP, Portuguese Culture and Language Institute).\n\nIn 1990, the Portuguese public television channel, RTP1 broadcast a series of thirteen interviews with him, called \"Conversas Vadias\". He died, at the São Francisco de Xavier Hospital, in Lisbon, in 1994.\n\nA documentary, named \"Agostinho da Silva: Um Pensamento Vivo\", directed by João Rodrigues Mattos, was released by Alfândega Filmes, in 2004. There is an unreleased interview, by António Escudeiro, called \"Agostinho por Si Próprio\", in which he talks about the worship of the Holy Spirit.\n\nHe's revered as one of the leading Portuguese intellectual personalities of the 20th century. Among the books he wrote, there are biographies of Michelangelo, Pasteur and St. Francis of Assisi, and his most influential book is, probably, \"Sete Cartas a Um Jovem Filósofo\" (\"Seven Letters to a Young Philosopher\").\n\nHe was a vegetarian.\n\n\"(translated from: Silva, Agostinho da, \"Educação de Portugal\". Lisboa: Ulmeiro, 1989. )\"\n\na) \"... that each man is different from myself and unique in the universe; that I am not the one, consequently, that must reflect instead of him, [...] that knows what is best for him, [...] that must point his way. Towards him I have only one right: helping him to be himself; as my essential duty to myself is being who I am, as uncomfortable as that may be [...]\"\n\nb) \"... loving others and wanting their good has been the reason of much oppression and much death [...]; essentially, you must not love in others anything but freedom, theirs and yours. They must, for love, cease being slaves, as must we, for love, cease being slave owners.\"\n\nc) \"And it is the child the one that must be considered the noble savage, spoiling her, mis-shaping her [...] the least we possibly can [...]\"\n\nd) \"Believing, thus, that man is born good, which means on my regard that he is born a brother to the world, not its owner and destroyer, I think that education [...] has not been much else than the system through which this fraternity is transformed in domination.\"\n\nAccording to Agostinho da Silva, some of the most relevant aspects that shaped the nature of the Portuguese people and influenced the culture of Portuguese-speaking nations are: its popular religiousness, with strong elements of millenarism and mysticism; a tradition of participatory democracy and autonomy based on small local communities; a tendency towards cultural miscegenation and cosmopolitanism in balance with a nostalgia for the homeland and its cultural heritage; a slow and difficult adaptation to modernity, namely to illuminist ideas and capitalist economy.\n\n"}

It was developed for the US Army in the 1970s, winning a competition to be designated the UH-60 Black Hawk and spawning a large family in US military service. New and improved versions of the UH-60 have been developed since. Civilian versions, and some military versions are produced under various S-70 model designations.\n\nThe S-70 family was developed to meet a US Army requirement to replace the UH-1 Iroquois family of utility medium-lift helicopters in 1972. Three YUH-60A prototypes were constructed, with the first flying in October 1974. They were evaluated against the Boeing-Vertol YUH-61A. The YUH-60A was selected for production, and entered service as the UH-60A Black Hawk with the US Army in 1979.\n\nAfter entering service, the helicopter was modified for new missions and roles, including mine laying and medical evacuation. An EH-60 variant was developed to conduct electronic warfare and special operations aviation developed the MH-60 variant to support its missions. In the late 1980s the model was upgraded to the UH-60L, which featured more power and lift with the upgrade to the -701C model of the GE T700 engine. The improved UH-60M model was developed in the early 2000s. The UH-60M and its International version, the S-70i, include GPS navigation, a glass cockpit, an integrated Flight Management System, and a significant upgrade to the powertrain and rotor system adding both power and lift capability.\n\nThe S-70 can perform a variety of missions, including air cavalry, electronic warfare, and aeromedical evacuation. Versions are used to transport the President of the United States under call sign \"Marine One\". In air assault operations it can move a squad of 11 combat troops and equipment or carry the 105 mm M102 howitzer, thirty rounds of ammunition, and a six-man crew. Alternatively, it can carry of cargo or sling load of cargo. The S-70 is equipped with advanced avionics and electronics, such as the Global Positioning System.\nThe United States Navy received the first navalized SH-60B Seahawk in 1983, and the SH-60F Ocean Hawk in 1988.\n\nThe HH-60G Pave Hawk is a highly modified version of the S-70 primarily designed to recover downed aircrew or other isolated personnel during war and equipped with a rescue hoist with a cable that has a lift capability, and a retractable in-flight refueling probe. The United States Air Force received the MH-60G Pave Hawk in 1982.\n\nThe United States Coast Guard received the HH-60J Jayhawk in 1992. It utilizes the equipment of the HH-60G Pave Hawk on the navalized SH-60 platform.\n\nThe S-70A Firehawk is a version of the S-70 designed for firefighting, rescue, medical evacuation, and external lift of bulky cargo and equipment. The Oregon National Guard was the first military organization in the world to add the Firehawk to its inventory; the Los Angeles County Fire Department was the first municipal organization. \n\nThe Army flies medical evacuation models which are configured as rotary winged medical suites. It also uses the S-70 for special operations by the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (\"Night Stalkers\") at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, designated as the MH-60K.\n\nThe \"Maple Hawk\" was a variant offered by Sikorsky to the Canadian Forces during the tender to replace the military's search and rescue helicopters.\n\n\nThe company name for the H-60/S-70 family is the S-70 Black Hawk.\n\n\n\n\n"}

From 1506, he was a teacher in Leutkirch, and subsequently in Pfullendorf, Schaffhausen, and – from 1522 – in Ravensburg.\n\nHe wrote several books in Latin, amongst them a Latin textbook \"Grammaticae artis institutio\" and a collection of Christian poems. His rhetorics textbook \"Epitome troporum\" defines 132 tropes and figures and gives examples of their use in ancient literature as well as references in contemporary books on rhetorics.\n\nLiving in the days of the Protestant Reformation, Susenbrotus distinctly remained a Roman Catholic.

{"id": "2038646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038646", "title": "Cosmic Cube", "text": "Cosmic Cube\n\nThe Cosmic Cube is a fictional object appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. It first appeared in the Marvel Universe in \"Tales of Suspense\" #79 (July 1966) and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.\n\nIn the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Cosmic Cube (renamed the Tesseract) contains the Space Stone, one of the fictional universe's Infinity Stones.\n\nThe first Cosmic Cube appeared in a story in \"Tales of Suspense\" #79–81 (July–Sept. 1966) and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. It was established as a device created by A.I.M. and capable of transforming any wish into reality, irrespective of the consequences. The Cube was also a plot device in a story that introduced the character of the Super-Adaptoid in \"Tales of Suspense\" #82–84 (Oct.–Dec. 1966). The Cube was also featured in a one-off story in \"Avengers\" #40 (1967) being found and briefly wielded by Namor.\n\nThe Cube reappeared in \"Captain America\" #115–120 (July–Dec. 1969), and featured in an epic cosmic storyline that starred arch-villain Thanos in \"Daredevil\" #107 (Jan. 1974) and \"Captain Marvel\" #25–33 (March 1972–July 1974, bi-monthly). Retrieved after Thanos' defeat, this original Cube featured in several Project Pegasus stories in \"Marvel Two-in-One\" #42–43 (Aug.–Sept. 1978), \"Marvel Two-in-One\" #57–58 (Dec. 1979–Jan. 1980), and \"Marvel Team-Up Annual\" #5 (1982).\n\nThe creation of a second Cube was shown in \"Super-Villain Team-Up\" #16–17 (May 1979 and June 1980), but this Cube was initially powerless and did not gain any reality-altering ability until years after its creation.\n\nA major element was added to the Cube's origin—that each is in fact an evolving sentient being—in \"Captain America Annual\" #7 (1983). The sentient Cube returned in \"Avengers\" #289–290 (March–April 1988) to end the threat of the Super-Adaptoid (itself originally empowered by a \"shard\" of a Cosmic Cube), and then in \"Fantastic Four\" #319 (Oct. 1988). This story revealed that the villain the Molecule Man had ties to the Cube and introduced a new character.\n\nThe miniseries \"The Infinity War\" #1–6 (June–Nov. 1992) and \"Infinity Crusade\" #1–6 (June–Nov. 1993) established that the items actually exist in a variety of geometric forms called Cosmic Containment Units.\n\nA third Cosmic Cube was created during the \"Taking A.I.M.\" storyline that ran through \"Avengers\" #386–388 (May–July 1995) and \"Captain America\" (vol. 2) #440–441 (June–July 1995). This unstable Cube has not been seen since it was sealed in a containment chamber at the conclusion of the storyline.\n\nThe previously powerless second Cosmic Cube finally gained an ability to alter reality in \"Captain America\" (vol. 2) #445–448 (November 1995–February 1996) but it was unstable and exploded at the end of that storyline. The second Cube's power reappeared in a storyline in \"Captain America\" (vol. 3) #14–19 (Feb.–July 1999) during which its power was internalized within the Red Skull, then stolen by Korvac and taken to an alternate 31st century Earth before being returned to the Red Skull on the present-day Earth, after which it was seemingly destroyed again by exposure to anti-matter energy.\n\nDoctor Doom acquires the Cosmic Cube in the Fantastic Four miniseries \"The World's Greatest Comics Magazine\" (2001). Doom uses a time machine to get the Cube from the ocean floor, into which it had dropped during a battle between the Red Skull and Captain America.\n\nA Cube—together with 11 other items from Marvel and DC Comics continuity—was used once again as a plot device in the intercompany crossover series \"JLA/Avengers\" #1–4 (Sept. 2003–April 2004, bi-monthly).\n\nThe Cube also shows up in \"Captain America\" (vol. 5). Aleksander Lukin wants the Cube and is willing to trade the Red Skull for it. The Red Skull claims he does not have it, but has spies out looking for it. Five years later, the Skull is in New York City and is in possession of it. General Lukin sent the Winter Soldier to retrieve the Cube from the Skull, and to kill him. The Skull transfers his mind into the body of Lukin through the powers of the Cube.\n\nA fragment of a Cube empowered a new character that featured in a single storyline in \"Marvel Team-Up\" (vol. 3) #20–24 (July–Nov. 2006), and a Cube also appeared in \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" (vol. 2) #19 (Dec. 2009). The item added a new aspect to the abilities of the villain the Absorbing Man in \"The Mighty Avengers\" #32–33 (Feb.–March 2010). A new Cosmic Cube was revealed in \"Avengers Assemble\" #5 (July 2012); it was revealed to be a working facsimile with more limited powers than the 'real thing'.\n\nThe Cosmic Cubes are actually containment devices created by various civilizations throughout the Marvel Universe at various times. Examples including the Skrulls (creators of the Cube that would eventually evolve into the Shaper of Worlds), and various other, unnamed civilizations (whose Cubes were gathered/stolen by unknown means by the Magus in the \"Infinity War\" story arc and the Goddess in the \"Infinity Crusade\" story arc). These matrices—which may or may not actually be shaped like a Cube—are suffused with reality-warping energies of unknown composition that comes from the realm of the Beyonders.\n\nUnknown to almost everyone in the Marvel Universe, including its creators, the nature of the mysterious energies are such that, after a sufficient but undefined period of time, the matrix will become self-aware and evolve into an independent, free-willed being still possessed of the original Cube's tremendous powers; the new being's overall personality is psychically imprinted with the beliefs, desires, and personalities of those who wielded it as a Cube (for example, the Shaper of Worlds, wielded for a long time by an insane and warlike Skrull Emperor, immediately destroyed a large portion of the galaxy that it was located in once it became sentient).\n\nOn Earth, the Cosmic Cube containment matrix was developed and created by an evil society of para-military scientists known as A.I.M. to further their ultimate goal of world conquest. The object is revealed to be so powerful that it drove to insanity its co-creator MODOK. Master villain and former Nazi the Red Skull obtains the device after taking control of the mind of the A.I.M. agent holding it, using a handheld device. Although apparently now all-powerful, the Skull became overconfident and was tricked and defeated by the hero Captain America, who pretended to surrender and ask to be the Skull's slave, then knocked the Cube away, causing it to fall into the ocean. It was found by Prince Namor after Hercules accidentally revealed it to him, but while battling the Avengers he lost contact with it, and it fell into the Earth. The Mole Man found it, but threw it away, not realizing its true value. Later, a shard of the Cube is also used by A.I.M. to power the android known as the Super-Adaptoid, who is sent in an unsuccessful attempt to kill Captain America.\n\nThe Red Skull eventually retrieves the Cube and toys with Captain America, but the Skull is defeated when A.I.M. uses an object called the \"Catholite Block\" to dissolve the Cube.\n\nThe Cube was eventually found (apparently having reformed) by Thanos who, like the Red Skull, wishes to control the universe (this also attracts the amorous attention of the cosmic entity Death). Although opposed by superhero team the Avengers and the alien Kree warrior Captain Mar-Vell, Thanos becomes supreme when he wills the Cube to make him a part of—and therefore in control of—everything. Thanos discards the Cube, believing it to be drained of power, and is then stripped of the power by the dying superhero named Mar-Vell, who shatters the Cube and restores the universe.\n\nBrought to research installation Project: Pegasus, the Cube was stolen by villain and cult leader Victorius, and is used to create the being Jude the Entropic Man. Both are neutralized when in simultaneous contact with the Cube (and the swamp monster the Man Thing). The Cube is returned to Pegasus by Captain America and the Fantastic Four member the Thing, where it eventually transforms the alien Wundarr into the entity the Aquarian.\n\nA second Cube was created on the Island of Exiles by a team of scientists (including Arnim Zola) working for the Red Skull and the Hate-Monger. Planning to transfer his consciousness into the completed Cube, the Hate-Monger secretly arranged for a distraction in the form of a strike team from the spy organization S.H.I.E.L.D. attacking the island in an attempt to retrieve the Cube. However, the Red Skull was aware of his plans and had kept secret the fact that the Cube project had succeeded only in creating a perfect prison, but had failed to capture the mysterious, omnidimensional x-element which gives the Cubes their reality-warping power. As a result, the Hate-Monger's mind was left trapped in a powerless Cube in the Red Skull's possession. This Cube was one of the trophies that the Red Skull kept in his home, Skull House.\n\nDuring a battle to stop A.I.M. from using the Cube once again, Captain America witnesses the Cube evolve into the entity called Kubik, which becomes a student of the Shaper of Worlds. Kubik returns to Earth when attracted by an anomaly possessing a fraction of its power, revealed to be the Super-Adaptoid. The Super-Adaptoid uses its abilities to \"copy\" Kubik's abilities and banishes the entity, intent on creating a race in its own image. The Adaptoid, however, is tricked into shutting down by Captain America. Kubik returns and then removes the sliver of the original Cosmic Cube from the Adaptoid that gave the robot its abilities.\n\nKubik also battles the renegade entity the Beyonder, and reveals to the entity and former Fantastic Four villain the Molecule Man that they are in fact both parts of an incomplete Cube (officially retconning the Beyonder's powers as shown in \"Secret Wars\" in the process), and convinces them to merge their powers. This forms a new being called Kosmos, who becomes the pupil of Kubik.\n\nThe character the Magus—an evil version of anti-hero Adam Warlock—acquires five Cosmic Cubes from neighboring universes, with each appearing in a different geometric form. The Magus uses mechanical aids to manipulate the Cubes, as their combined presence would quickly cause permanent brain damage. The character uses the Cubes to create evil doppelgangers of almost all of the Marvel heroes and then alters the universe, but is tricked and defeated when acquiring the Infinity Gauntlet, as the Reality Gem is revealed to be a fake, thus creating a gap in his powers.\n\nAlthough the Magus is defeated, Warlock's \"good side\"—the female Goddess—also appears and wishes to purge the universe of all evil. To do this, she collects 30 containment units, with each storing the power of a Cosmic Cube, and merges them into a \"Cosmic Egg\". Despite the fact that the Egg can fulfill the Goddess' wishes—although, unlike the Infinity Gauntlet, it has no power over the soul—the character is defeated by Warlock and Thanos. During this time, the two questioned Mephisto about the origins of the Cubes in exchange for giving a Cube to Mephisto, but they were able to cheat the deal by giving Mephisto a drained Cube, as he never specified that the Cube had to still be functional.\n\nA third Cosmic Cube was created by an Adaptoid-controlled faction of A.I.M. based on the island of Boca Caliente. This Cube was unstable and its reality-warping ability began to leak out onto the surrounding island, creating Cube constructs of anyone that was in the thoughts of nearby people. An Avengers team attempted to stop the Cube and the dying Captain America was willing to sacrifice himself to do so. In the end, it was an Adaptoid who had been accompanying Captain America and had been impressed by his heroic nature who ended the threat by willingly transforming itself into a non-sentient containment chamber for the Cube's energies.\n\nThe second Cube was eventually recovered by the KubeKult, fanatical followers of the Hate-Monger, who spied upon the A.I.M. Adaptoids and discovered how to power it. Fearing how the Hate-Monger would punish him for his betrayal, the Red Skull allied himself with then-rogue S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Sharon Carter to kidnap the dying Captain America and restore him to health. Reluctantly working together, the trio invaded a KubeKult base to steal the erratically functioning Cube, but the Red Skull seized it and willed Captain America to be drawn inside it into an artificial reality during World War II, where Captain America and Bucky were on a mission to kill Hitler. The Red Skull believed that he would be able to wield the Cube's power only if Captain America killed Hitler's consciousness within the Cube. However, the Bucky within the Cube (actually a projection of Captain America's own mind) revealed what was really going on and Captain America was able to will himself out of the Cube. Appearing before the Skull, Captain America threw his shield in such a way that it first severed the Skull's arm, causing him to drop the Cube, and then struck and shattered the Cube itself, causing an explosion that seemingly destroyed both itself and the Red Skull.\n\nMonths later, the Red Skull reappears, now with the Cube's power internalized within his body. He was approached by the time-traveler Kang the Conqueror (actually the disguised cosmic entity Korvac), who told him that the reason he had failed to completely control the Cube's power in the past was because his knowledge of the universe was incomplete. At the suggestion of \"Kang\", the Skull willed the starship of Galactus to travel to Earth so he could drain it of the needed information. At the same time, Korvac (now disguised as Uatu the Watcher) appeared to Captain America and Sharon Carter and managed to convince them that the only way to prevent the Skull from becoming unstoppable was for Captain America to kill him during a brief moment of vulnerability. Captain America did so, but as the Skull died, his body released the Cube energy, which flowed into \"Uatu\", who revealed his true identity and used his increased power to return to his alternate 31st century Earth to conquer it. However, Captain America followed him and fought him repeatedly, with Korvac rebooting the 31st century reality each time Captain America disturbed his perfectly ordered machine world. Eventually, Captain America managed to convince Korvac that the reason he was able to achieve anything at all against Korvac was due to there being too much humanity left within Korvac when he acquired the Cube's power. Accordingly, Korvac transported himself and Captain America back to just before the Skull died, but this time Captain America did not strike the fatal blow. Vulnerable to the Skull's power, Korvac teleported himself, Captain America and Carter aboard the starship, but the Skull soon found him and scattered Korvac across six dimensions. Soon afterwards, the Skull was tricked by Captain America into entering an anti-matter energy beam within the starship's engine room, which separated the Cube energy from him. Before the energy dissipated, Captain America and the Skull were each able to use its wish-granting ability to save themselves and Carter from death.\n\nA Cosmic Cube was one of the 12 items of power sought by superhero teams the Avengers and the Justice League of America when they competed against each other in a game organized by Krona and the Grandmaster. It was the final item of the quest, found in the Savage Land, where both teams converged for a full-scale fight, during which Green Lantern Kyle Rayner was able to use the Cube as a substitute power source for his power ring when his usual battery had been stolen and the ring was running out of power. Quicksilver was finally able to gain the Cube, bringing the game to a stalemate, but to make sure Krona lost, Captain America helped Batman to take it, because they were the only ones, aside from the Atom, who knew the true stakes of the game: Krona had forced the Grandmaster to take the Justice League as his representatives, so the League had to win in order to prevent Krona from destroying the Marvel Universe. Batman briefly attempted to use the Cube to end the game — having been filled in on its capabilities by Captain America — before the Grandmaster took it from him to tally up the score. Enraged at his loss, Krona attacked the Grandmaster, who then used the Cube along with all other items of power to temporarily fuse the Marvel and DC Universes and imprison Krona in the intersection, hoping he would be unable to destroy a universe if his own existence were linked to it.\n\nThe Red Skull has finally created one by using pieces of the previous Cubes, and Aleksander Lukin wants it as much. The Red Skull is assassinated by the one person that Lukin was willing to trade for the Cube—the Winter Soldier. In the process of being assassinated, the Skull uses the Cube's power to transfer his mind into the body of Lukin for some time.\n\nA youth called Curtis Doyle becomes the hero Freedom Ring when he finds a fragment of the original Cube in the form of a ring, which allows the altering of reality in a very limited area of 15 feet around the wearer. The character dies in battle saving Captain America, Spider-Man, Spider-Woman, and Wolverine from the villain Iron Maniac. The ring is later found by a friend of Doyle, a Skrull who had settled on Earth and adopts the name the 'Crusader'.\n\nThe powerful entity D'Spayre attempted to enhance his power by using a Cosmic Cube to draw on the grief of the general public in the aftermath of Captain America's assassination, only for his use of the Cube to have an apparently unintended side-effect when it granted the 'wish' of those who wanted Captain America back by drawing the Invaders into the present. He was defeated in a confrontation with the New Avengers when Echo proved immune to his powers due to her deafness, allowing her to take the Cube from him. The Cube is then used by Paul Anslem, a World War II soldier who had traveled with the Invaders against his will. Anslem's intentions to save his friends, who had died during an assault on a Nazi stronghold, allows the Red Skull of the World War II era to gain enough power to take over Earth. Anslem again regains control of the Cube with super-powered assistance and restores the timeline to what it should have been.\n\nA Cube is also given to Guardians of the Galaxy member Star-Lord by time-traveling villain Kang the Conqueror to use against Adam Warlock's evil alter ego, the Magus. However, the Magus altered perception to make it seem like the Cube's power was used up. Star-Lord used the Cube's last bit of energy for real by subduing the reborn Thanos, rendering it a \"cosmic paperweight\".\n\nThe Absorbing Man becomes capable of assimilating the abilities of a fraction of a Cube. He is stopped by criminal mastermind Norman Osborn, who uses a magical sword (provided by the Asgardian god Loki) to neutralize the Absorbing Man's abilities.\n\nA new Cosmic Cube is later revealed to have been created by the U.S. government. It is stolen by members of the Zodiac at the behest of Thanos. Thanos' plot is later foiled by the combined might of the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\nDuring the \"\" storyline, Maria Hill and the rest of S.H.I.E.L.D. used pieces of a Cosmic Cube to create , a near-omnipotent child, originally conceived by Longshot and the Cosmic Cube \"Miss Grapples\". With Kobik's help, S.H.I.E.L.D. began brainwashing supervillains into becoming mild-mannered civilians, who were then imprisoned in a gated community called Pleasant Hill. When the villains rebel, Kobik decides to bring Steve Rogers, then reduced to an old man due to the breakdown of his Super-Soldier serum, back to his physical peak, but due to the Red Skull's influence over the Cube from which Kobik was made, she unknowingly replaces Rogers with a covert HYDRA loyalist version of him, believing that to be the \"right\" version of him. This results in the real Rogers' consciousness becoming trapped within the Cube until he finds Kobik and encourages her to set things right by showing the atrocities his doppelgänger had committed in the name of HYDRA during the \"Secret Empire\" storyline; she then brings him back to the real world, with some help from the heroes outside.\n\nIn the Ultimate Marvel imprint alternate universe title \"Ultimate Fantastic Four\", Mister Fantastic builds a \"cuboid volitional lattice\" courtesy of a deliberate, subconscious suggestion from the Ultimate version of the Titan Thanos. Another version of the Cube exists as a creation of A.I.M. under the employment of Red Skull, which they stole blueprints of from the Fantastic Four's recently abandoned Baxter Building.\n\nA version of the Cosmic Cube is seen in Project Pegasus alongside the Watcher and Infinity Gauntlet.\n\nIn \"\" episode \"Everything is Wonderful\", it is revealed that A.I.M. is creating a Cosmic Cube for HYDRA. Later, MODOK reveals that A.I.M. was using the Cosmic Cube project to swindle money out of HYDRA. But when A.I.M. determines that there is a chance that the Cosmic Cube might be an unintended success, they return the money that HYDRA has paid, saying the project was a failure, but they really intend to keep such an all-powerful device to themselves. Baron Strucker sees through MODOK's deception, and a war for possession of the Cube erupts between A.I.M. and HYDRA in the subsequent episode \"Hail Hydra\" forcing the Avengers to get involved. The clash ends when Captain America and Baron Strucker seize the Cube simultaneously and nothing appears to happen. But unknown to the heroes, the Cosmic Cube actually acts upon Captain America's desires and returns his deceased sidekick Bucky to life.\n\nA version of the Cube can be seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where it is known as the Tesseract. It is introduced in the mid-credits scene of \"Thor\", in the custody of Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. In \"\", it is revealed that the Tesseract was brought to Earth by Odin centuries ago. In the film, the Red Skull finds the Tesseract and uses its power to create weapons for Hydra before he is defeated by Captain America and the Tesseract is retrieved by Howard Stark. It is seen again in \"The Avengers\", where it is stolen by Loki from S.H.I.E.L.D. Loki then uses it to create a portal to allow an invading army of Chitauri to attack the Earth, but they are defeated by the Avengers and the Tesseract is taken back to Asgard. From there, it is briefly mentioned in \"\" and in \"\", where it is revealed that the Tesseract contains the Space Stone, one of the six Infinity Stones that Thanos wishes to obtain. At the end of \"\", Loki steals the Tesseract as the survivors flee Asgard to escape from Hela. At the start of \"\", Loki hands the Tesseract over to Thanos so that Thanos will spare Thor's life. Thanos crushes the Cube in his hand, revealing the Space Stone within before placing it in his gauntlet. In the 2019 film \"Captain Marvel\", set in the year 1995, it is shown that while in government possession, Dr. Wendy Lawson tries to use the Tesseract to build a light-speed engine, but while on a test run they crash and an explosion causes Carol Danvers to attain cosmic power. Later aboard Dr. Lawson's laboratory, Goose ingests the Tesseract, before regurgitating it onto Fury's desk. In \"\", the Space Stone, along with the other Infinity Stones is reduced to atoms by Thanos, after his success of eliminating half of existence to keep his work from being undone. The Avengers go back in time to retrieve the past version of the Tesseract, first to New York City during 2012, although Tony Stark and Scott Lang fail in stealing the 2012 Tesseract (thanks to 2012 Hulk accidentally knocking Stark over), resulting instead in 2012 Loki escaping with it. Stark, along with Steve Rogers, then travel back to 1970 and successfully retrieve the 1970 version of the Tessaract. The 1970 Space Stone, along with the other Past Infinity Stones, is then used to reverse Thanos' actions and to erase a past version of Thanos and his army from existence before being returned to 1970 to prevent alternate timelines from forming.\n\nIn \"Lego Marvel Super Heroes\", Silver Surfer has a board made of \"Cosmic Bricks\" instead of just one Cosmic Cube. The bricks are collected throughout the game and many heroes race to get them before the villains, mainly Doctor Doom and Loki, do. The Tesseract itself appears in the game when Captain America, Thor, the Human Torch, and Wolverine have to go retrieve it. They succeed in recovering it. While everyone is discussing how to deal with it, Wolverine takes the \"Glow Cube\" for himself and brings it to the X-Mansion, hoping that Professor X will use it to locate Magneto. Magneto and the Brotherhood of Mutants then break in and take the Tesseract. Magneto takes the Cube to Doctor Doom who is going to use it in a ray gun to save the world from Galactus' hunger by controlling his mind, but Loki uses his magic mind control to make Doom hide that fact instead saying that he would use it to enslave the world. After Doctor Doom is defeated, Loki reveals its true purpose as a mind-control ray with the Tesseract serving as an infinite power source. He uses it on Galactus to destroy Earth and Asgard, but an alliance of Marvel heroes and villains puts a stop to it as they send Galactus and Loki elsewhere in space using a wormhole while S.H.I.E.L.D. takes the Cosmic Cube.\n\nA flawed Cosmic Cube is the main plot device in Steven A. Roman's \"Chaos Engine\" novel series, with the object passing between super-villains Doctor Doom, Magneto, and the Red Skull, each of whom uses it to create his own unique version of a perfect world. A team of X-Men who were operating outside their reality when the initial change occurred are the only ones capable of setting things right.\n\nIn the show \"Marvel Universe Live!\", Thor attempts to eliminate the threat of the Cosmic Cube - here stated as having the ability to corrupt any who attempt to use it - by shattering it with Mjolnir, but when Loki attempts to use a fragment of the Cube to 'clone' it for his own use, the Avengers are forced to retrieve the other fragments of the Cube from Hydra, AIM and the Sinister Six to use it against Loki.\n\n"}

{"id": "2038657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038657", "title": "Night Fever", "text": "Night Fever\n\n\"Night Fever\" is a song written and performed by the Bee Gees. It first appeared on the soundtrack to \"Saturday Night Fever\" on RSO Records. Producer Robert Stigwood wanted to call the film \"Saturday Night\", but singer Robin Gibb expressed hesitation at the title. Stigwood liked the title \"Night Fever\" but was wary of marketing a movie with that name. The song bounded up the Billboard charts while the Bee Gees two previous hits from \"Saturday Night Fever\" soundtrack (\"How Deep is Your Love\" and \"Stayin' Alive\") were still in the top ten. The record debuted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Chart at #76, then leaped up 44 positions to #32. It then moved: 32–17–8–5–2–1. It remained at #1 for eight weeks (the most for any single that year), and ultimately spent 13 weeks in the top 10. For the first five weeks that \"Night Fever\" was at #1, \"Stayin' Alive\" was at #2. Also, for one week in March, Bee Gees related songs held five of the top positions on the Hot 100 chart, and more impressively, four of the top five position, with \"Night Fever\" at the top of the list. The B-side of \"Night Fever\" was a live version of \"Down the Road\" taken from the Bee Gees 1977 album, \"Here at Last... Bee Gees... Live\".\n\nWhen Bee Gees manager Robert Stigwood was producing a movie about a New York disco scene, the working title for the film at that time was \"Saturday Night\". Stigwood asked the group to write a song using that name as a title, but the Bee Gees disliked it. They had already written a song called \"Night Fever\", so the group convinced Stigwood to use that and change the film to \"Saturday Night Fever\".\n\nThe string intro of \"Night Fever\" was inspired by \"Theme from \"A Summer Place\"\" by Percy Faith, according to keyboardist Blue Weaver when he was performing it one morning at the sessions and Barry Gibb walked in and heard the new idea for this song. As Weaver explains the history behind this song:\n\nBarry Gibb, Robin Gibb and Maurice Gibb completed the lyrics for \"Night Fever\" sitting on a staircase (reminiscent of their first international hit \"New York Mining Disaster 1941\", which was written also in a staircase back in 1967).\n\nThe Bee Gees began recording this song by April 1977 in France and finishing it in September the same year. A demo of \"Night Fever\" with some instrumental and vocals heard on it exists and was now available to download on Rhino Records' website.\n\nIt also replaced Andy Gibb's \"Love Is Thicker Than Water\" at number one and was in turn replaced by Yvonne Elliman's \"If I Can't Have You\"—all of which were written and produced by the Gibb brothers. It would be the third of six consecutive US #1s for the band, tying the Beatles for the record for most consecutive #1 singles. \"Billboard\" ranked it as the No. 2 song for 1978, behind Andy Gibb's \"Shadow Dancing.\"\n\n\"Night Fever\" topped the UK Singles Chart for two weeks, their third UK number-one, and in the US it remained the number-one \"Billboard\" Hot 100 single for over two months in 1978. In addition to \"Saturday Night Fever\", the song has also appeared in the movie and on the soundtrack for \"Mystery Men\". The song is listed at number 38 on \"Billboard's All Time Top 100\". It is also featured in other films including \"Luna\", \"Mr. Saturday Night\", \"I.D.\", \"Whatever Happened to Harold Smith?\", and \"Avenue Montaigne\".\n\nA music video was made for the song in 1978, but not shown to the public until 2004. It features the brothers singing the song in a darkened studio, layered over background video filmed while driving along \"Motel Row\" on Collins Avenue, a three-mile motel strip in what is now Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Most of these motels are now closed or demolished, including several whose names are reminiscent of Las Vegas resorts (Castaways, Desert Inn, Sahara, Golden Nugget).\n\n\nIn 1996, the Austrian music group Ex-It covered the song and made a small notable success. Large parts of the original were retained in this version, but with many rap passages added. This cover is the compilations \"Dance Now! 14\", \"Maxi Dance Sensation 21\" and \"Hot Hits [TL 541/35]\".\n\nThe music video copies many elements of the movie Saturday Night Fever and satirizes the same. At the beginning of the video, the DJ plays the song, while the protagonist and his girlfriend in a tool shop look around and watch a radio. Then prepare for a visit to a disco and dance there in the rest of the plot.\n\nNorwegian humor group Prima Vera covered this song in 1978 under the title \"Gight Feber\" (\"giktfeber\" is Norwegian for \"rheumatism fever\").\n\nTexan punk rock band the Dicks covered this song on the B-side of their 1980 debut single \"Hate the Police\" under the title \"All Night Fever\".\n\nIt was covered by Adam Garcia and reached number 15 in the UK singles charts in May 1998.\n\nBrazilian countertenor, pop and jazz singer Edson Cordeiro covered the song in his 1999 album \"Disco Clubbing 2 - Mestre de Cerimônia\".\n\nIn 2008, Australian singer and songwriter Tina Arena performed a cover version of \"Night Fever\" for the French film \"Disco\".\n\nIn 2012, the song was featured in the sixteenth episode of the third season of \"Glee\".\n\nIn 2016, Kylie Minogue covered this song for the \"Saturday Night Fever\" musical. Later, the song was included on French edition of her Christmas album \"\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2038668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038668", "title": "Yeshe Tsogyal", "text": "Yeshe Tsogyal\n\nYeshe Tsogyal (also known as \"Victorious Ocean of Wisdom\", \"Wisdom Lake Queen\" (, ཡེ་ཤེས་མཚོ་རྒྱལ, or by her Sanskrit name \"Jñānasāgara\" \"Wisdom Ocean\"; or by her clan name of Lady Kharchen), (c.757 or 777–817CE) , or b.early 8th cent. - d.mid 8th cent., was the Mother of Tibetan Buddhism. Some sources regard her as a wife of Trisong Detsen, emperor of Tibet. Her main karmamudrā consort was Padmasambhava, a founder-figure of the Nyingma tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. She is known to have revealed terma with Padmasambhava and was also the main scribe for these terma. Later, Yeshe Tsogyal also hid many of Padmasambhava's terma on her own, under the instructions of Padmasambhava for future generations.\n\nBorn a princess in the region of Kharchen, Tibet, in about 777 CE, she lived for approximately 99 years and is a preeminent figure in Tibetan Buddhism and a role model for contemporary spiritual practitioners. Although often referred to as being Padamasambhava's main consort, she was primarily a spiritual master and teacher in her own right.\n\nBased on her spiritual accomplishments, the Nyingma and Karma Kagyu schools of Tibetan Buddhism recognize Yeshe Tsogyal as a female Buddha. The translators of \"Lady of the Lotus-Born\", the namtar, or spiritual biography, that Yeshe Tsogyal left as a terma, observe:\nGiven Yeshe Tsogyal's important place in the various schools of Tibetan Buddhism, it is not surprising that there are questions about whether she is an actual historical figure. There are at least four translations of Yeshe Tsogyal's spiritual biography in English, and one in French. Yet,\n\nEven so, in another publication, this same scholar writes,\n\nSo whether there is enough historical evidence to confirm or deny Yeshe Tsogyal as a historical figure, from the perspective of the spiritual traditions within which she is prominent, the details of her life are rich. Here are some of the details of Yeshe Tsogyal's conception and birth:\n\nAccording to legend, Yeshe Tsogyal was born in the same manner as the Buddha, a mantra sounding as her mother gave birth painlessly. She is considered a reincarnation of the Buddha's own mother, Maya. Her name, \"Wisdom Lake Queen\" (), derives from her birth causing a nearby lake to double in size.\n\nHer spiritual inclinations were present from a very young age and Yeshe Tsogyal wanted to pursue a life of dharma practice rather than marry. She felt so strongly about this, that she ran away and had to be brought back by force. At the age of sixteen, she was compelled into an unwanted arranged marriage with the then-emperor of Tibet, Trisong Detsen.\n\nIt was after their marriage, that Trisong Detsen invited Padmasambhava to come to Tibet from India and propagate the Buddhist teachings. Yeshe Tsogyal was given by Trisong Detsen to Padmasambhava as an offering. Padmasambhava freed Yeshe Tsogyal and she became Padmasambhava's main disciple and consort.\n\nAs to the question of the place of female practitioners in Tibetan Buddhism, Yeshe Tsogyal has been an important role model. When she herself asked about \"her inferior female body\" (a common theme in the biographies of female spiritual practitioners), Padmasambhava advised Yeshe Tsogyal that far from being a hindrance to enlightenment, as was generally accepted, a woman's body is an asset: \"The basis for realizing enlightenment is a human body. Male or female, there is no great difference. But if she develops the mind bent on enlightenment the woman’s body is better\".\n\nAfter many years of serious study and meditative practice, Yeshe Tsogyal's level of spiritual awakening, enlightenment, was equal to that of Padmasambhava.\n\nYeshe Tsogyal is also known to have spent many years in isolated meditation retreat. She accomplished several different cycles of tantric spiritual practices that she received from Padmasambhava and various wisdom beings including the practices of tummo, Vajrakilaya, karmamudra sadhana, and zhitro.\n\nFor example, one scholar relates how Yeshe Tsogyal received the empowerment to practice zhitro from a wisdom being, a vidyādhara:\nAll of these practices brought Yeshe Tsogyal to awakening. Among lay Tibetans, she is understood as a fully enlightened Buddha who takes the form of an ordinary woman so as to be accessible to the average person, \"who, for the time being, do not see her Vajravarahi form as a fully perfected deity.\"\n\nAt the time of her death, Yeshe Tsogyal is known to have had eleven main disciples, both women and men. These disciples included:\n\n\nAll of Yeshe Tsogyal's final teachings were given at the request of one of these eleven main disciples.\n\nAlong with these eleven, there were approximately 79 other acolytes present during the final teachings of Yeshe Tsogyal. Some sources say that there were no less than 100 people present for these final teachings.\n\nThere are numerous living spiritual lineages and Buddhist organizations that focus on or include the spiritual practices of Yeshe Tsogyal. These include, but are not limited to:\n\nYeshe Tsogyal is also considered a manifestation of Saraswati and sometimes identified with the Buddha Tara. She is also considered to be an emanation of Samantabhadrī, Prajnaparamita, and Vajrayogini. In the \"Life of Yeshe Tsogyel,\" Padmasambhava predicted that Yeshe Tsogyel would be reborn as Machig Labdrön; her consort, Atsara Sale, would become Topabhadra, Machig’s husband; her assistant and another of Padmasambhava’s consorts, Tashi Khyidren, would be reborn as Machig’s only daughter, and so on. All of the important figures in Tsogyel’s life were to be reborn in the life of Machig Labdron, including Padmasambhava himself, who would become Dampa Sangye.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2038670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038670", "title": "Chart datum", "text": "Chart datum\n\nA chart datum is the water level that depths displayed on a nautical chart are measured from. A chart datum is generally derived from some phase of the tide. Common chart datums are \"lowest astronomical tide\" and \"mean lower low water\". In non-tidal areas, e.g. the Baltic Sea, mean sea level (MSL) is used.\n\nA chart datum is a vertical datum and must not be confused with the horizontal datum for the chart.\n\nThe following tidal phases are commonly used.\nLowest Astronomical Tide (LAT) is defined as the lowest tide level which can be predicted to occur under average meteorological conditions and under any combination of astronomical conditions.\nMany national charting agencies, including the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office and the Australian Hydrographic Service,\n\nOne advantage of using LAT for chart datums is that all predicted tidal heights must then be positive (or zero) avoiding possible ambiguity and the need to explicitly state sign. Calculation of the LAT only allows for gravitational effects so lower tides may occur in practice due to other factors (e.g. meteorological effects such as high pressure systems).\n\nThe United States' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration uses Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW), which is the average height of the lowest tide recorded at a tide station each day during a 19-year recording period, known as the National Tidal Datum Epoch. MLLW is only a mean, so some tidal levels may be negative relative to MLLW; see also mean low water spring. The 19-year recording period is the nearest full year count to the 18.6-year cycle of the lunar node regression, which has an effect on tides.\n\nSimilarly, the Mean Higher High Water (MHHW), is the average height of the highest tide recorded at a tide station each day during the recording period. It is used, among other things as a datum from which to measure the navigational clearance, or air draft, under bridges.\n\nCharted depths and drying heights on nautical charts are given relative to chart datum. Some height values on charts, such as vertical clearances under bridges or overhead wires, may be referenced to a different vertical datum, such as mean high water springs or highest astronomical tide (HAT) (for \"HAT\" see tidal range).\n\nTide tables give the height of the tide above a chart datum making it feasible to calculate the depth of water at a given point \"and\" at a given time by adding the charted depth to the height of the tide. One may calculate whether an area that dries is under water by subtracting the drying height from the [given] height calculated from the tide table.\n\nUsing charts and tables not based on the same geodetic datum can result in incorrect calculation of water depths.\n\nIn recent years national hydrographic agencies have spearheaded developments to establish chart datum with respect to the Geodetic Reference System 1980 (GRS 80) reference ellipsoid, thus enabling direct compatibility with satellite navigation (GNSS) positioning. Examples of this include Vertical Offshore Reference Frames (VORF) for the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO) and Bathyelli for Naval Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service (SHOM).\n"}
{"id": "2038672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038672", "title": "You Are Not Alone", "text": "You Are Not Alone\n\n\"You Are Not Alone\" is a song by American singer Michael Jackson from his ninth studio album \"\" (1995). It was released on August 15, 1995 as the second single from the album. The song was re-released in 2006, as part of Jackson's \"\" collection box set, where it re-entered at number 30 in the UK Singles Chart in 2006. The pop and R&B ballad was written by American R&B singer R. Kelly for Michael Jackson in response to difficult times in his own personal life. Kelly \nsent a bare demo tape to Jackson, who liked the song and decided to produce it with him in Chicago. Jackson's interest in the song was also linked to recent events in his personal life.\n\nThe song's corresponding music video, which featured Jackson and his then-wife Lisa Marie Presley, featured scenes of semi-nudity. \"You Are Not Alone\" received a generally positive critical reception and was the recipient of Grammy and American Music Award nominations. The song was a commercial success. It holds a \"Guinness World Record\" as the first song in the 37-year history of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 to debut at number one, and was later certified platinum by the RIAA. The track also topped the charts in Austria, Belgium, France, Ireland, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. \"You Are Not Alone\" was Michael Jackson's thirteenth and last number one single in the United States during his lifetime.\n\nAfter Jackson's death in June 2009, Kelly paid tribute to him by including a version of the song on his studio album \"Love Letter\" (2010). In 2011, a clip of the song was remixed with the song \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\"; the final \"Immortal Version\" was released on the \"Immortal\" album.\n\n\"You Are Not Alone\" is a pop and R&B ballad about love and isolation. The song was written by R. Kelly and produced by Kelly and Jackson. Kelly wrote the song after losing close people in his life. Kelly was delighted to be able to work with his idol, explaining \"I was psyched ... I feel I could have done his whole album. Not being selfish. I was just that geeked about it. It was an experience out of this world ... It's amazing to know that five years ago I was writing songs in a basement in the ghetto and now I'm writing for Michael Jackson ... I'd be a fool not to say it's a dream come true.\" Jackson contacted Kelly to see if he had any material available. Kelly forwarded a tape recording of the song and Jackson then agreed to work with Kelly on the piece. On the tape sent to Jackson, Kelly sung \"You Are Not Alone\" mimicking Jackson's vocal style, explaining, \"I think I am him. I become him. I want him to feel that as well.\" Jackson found the interpretation amusing. They spent the last week of November 1994 together in the studio working on the track.\n\nJackson explained that he instantly liked the song, but listened to it twice before making his final decision. Although the song was written by Kelly, Jackson was adamant that the production should be a collaborative effort among the two musicians. The tape sent to him had no harmony or modulations, so Jackson added a choir in the final portion and added a sense of climax and structure to the final piece. The song is written in the key of B major. The song has a tempo of 60 beats per minute, making it one of Jackson's slowest songs.\n\nIn 2007, a Belgian court ruled that Kelly had plagiarized the 1993 composition \"If We Can Start All Over\" by Eddy and Danny Van Passel. The court transferred rights track to the Van Passels, though the judgment is only recognized in Belgium.\n\n'You Are Not Alone' received positive views from music critics. James Hunter of \"Rolling Stone\" noted that, \"the excellent current single 'Scream' or the first-rate R&B ballad 'You Are Not Alone' – manage to link the incidents of Jackson's recent past to universal concepts, like injustice or isolation. When he bases his music in the bluntness of hip-hop, Jackson sketches funky scenarios denouncing greed, blanket unreliability and false accusation\". Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\" said that it was the only conventional love song on the new material on \"HIStory\". He compared it to Mariah Carey's song \"Hero\" and said it \"sounds like a surefire hit\". In more recent years, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic expressed the opinion that \"You Are Not Alone\" was amongst some of the best songs Jackson ever released, calling the song seductive. The R&B critic and journalist Nelson George described the song as lovely and supple.\n\nWriter and journalist J. Randy Taraborrelli wrote of the song in 2004, \"[it] remains among Michael's best songs ... On listening to 'You Are Not Alone', one wonders how many times Michael tried to tell himself, during his most desperate and anguished times, that he \"did\" have support in his life, from a higher power, or even friends and family, whether he actually believed it or not\". Fred Shuster of the \"Daily News of Los Angeles\" described it as the best song on the album. Conversely, while Steve Holsey of \"Michigan Chronicle\" gave the album a positive review, he described the song as the worst on the album, calling the Kelly penned lyrics \"trite\" and below the standard set by Jackson's own lyrical skills. \"You Are Not Alone\" received an American Music Award nomination and a Grammy nomination both for \"Best Pop Vocal Performance\".\n\nCommercially, \"You Are Not Alone\" remains one of Jackson's best selling singles and it is also his 13th number one song. It holds the \"Guinness World Record\" for the first song ever to debut at number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. It was also Jackson's last number one single on the chart. It debuted at number one with first week sales of 120,000 copies. The song was certified platinum by the RIAA and sold one million copies domestically. It broke the record set by his previous single \"Scream/Childhood,\" which was the first song in the 37-year history of \"Billboard\" to debut at number five—where it peaked. It peaked at number one in the UK after a debut at number three in the prior week. The song also reached number one in Wallonia, France, New Zealand, Spain and Switzerland. In Canada it peaked at number two. It became a top ten hit in every major market.\n\nThe music video was directed by Wayne Isham on July 12, 1995 and begins with a large number of paparazzi taking photographs of Jackson. The plot then centers around two locations: a temple where Jackson appears in an affectionate semi-nude scene with his then-wife, Lisa Marie Presley, and a theater where Jackson performs the song to an empty hall. Jackson also appears alone in other locations such as deserts and along tide pools. The slightly extended version that appeared on \"HIStory on Film, Volume II\" was notable for scenes where special effects were used to give Jackson white, feathery, almost angelic wings. Several of these scenes included Jackson's side having been pierced by an arrow. The other version of the video is included on \"Number Ones\" and \"Michael Jackson's Vision\". The temple scenes were a homage to Maxfield Parrish's 1922 painting \"Daybreak\". The theater scenes were filmed at the Pantages Theatre, in Los Angeles.\n\nJackson first performed \"You Are Not Alone\" at the 1995 Soul Train Music Awards, then at the 1995 BET Awards and also at the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards. At the latter awards ceremony, the song was performed without the second verse. Jackson then performed the song at the Royal Brunei concert in 1996 where it was performed as a complete song. Jackson also performed it during the HIStory World Tour as a complete song, during which one lucky girl was allowed to dance with him on stage, similar to the Soul Train Music Awards performance. Jackson's next performance of \"You Are Not Alone\" was at the MJ & Friends concert in Seoul on June 25, 1999; this also turned out to be the song's last performance by Jackson himself, occurring ten years to the day of his death. The song was performed without the second verse, similar to the \"1995 MTV Awards\" performance. The song was also due to be performed at the This Is It concert series, however the shows were cancelled due to his untimely death.\n\nDiana Ross recorded a version of this song on her international-only released album, \"Voice of Love\" produced by Nick Martinelli. Ross would also close her successful 2010–12 with this song as a tribute to Jackson.\n\nCD single\n\n12\" single\n\nFrankie Knuckles Mixes\n\nJon B. Mixes\n\nR. Kelly Mix\n\nThe final twelve acts from the sixth series of TV talent show \"The X Factor\" in the United Kingdom released a cover version of the song on November 15, 2009 in aid of Great Ormond Street Hospital. The finalists premiered the song live on the November 15 edition of the programme; the single was available for digital download that day and a physical release followed the day after. The release of the song follows a similar occurrence a year earlier, when the final twelve acts from the fifth series released a cover version of Mariah Carey's \"Hero\" in aid of Help for Heroes and raised over £1 million. It has been confirmed to have sold over 400,000 copies, therefore achieving a Gold single certification.\n\nThe video is very similar to the video of the cover version of the charity single of the year before. It shows various contestants performing their part in front of a plain black background, then shows the 12 finalists together performing the song in front of a screen of photos. Photos and video footage of the finalists at the Great Ormond Street Hospital are shown throughout the video.\n\nR. Kelly recorded his own version of the song and put it on his critically acclaimed 2010 album \"Love Letter\", he recorded it as a tribute to Jackson following his death. The song was a hidden bonus song on the album, shown as the final song on the album's track list. The song starts with Kelly paying tribute to Jackson, saying \"In loving memories of my hero... MJ\".\n\n\n"}

We are a co-operative bunch and we are not out to slit each other's throats.\"\nThe Independent Schools Council said independent schools were following long-established practice and were not aware that the Competition Act 1998 (on which they were not consulted) had removed their previous exemption from anti-cartel rules.\n\nThe OFT concluded in 2005 that 50 schools, including seven in the Eton Group, had exchanged detailed information about planned fee levels in a survey coordinated by Sevenoaks School.\nThe case was settled in 2006, with the schools admitting that such exchange of information \"involved a distortion of competition and infringed competition law\", but not admitting to any effect on fees.

{"id": "2038684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038684", "title": "Humanists International", "text": "Humanists International\n\nHumanists International (known as the International Humanist and Ethical Union, or IHEU, from 1952–2019) is an international non-governmental organisation championing secularism, human rights and equality, motivated by humanist values. Founded in Amsterdam in 1952, it is an umbrella organisation made up of more than 160 humanist, atheist, rationalist, secular, skeptic, freethought and Ethical Culture organisations from over 80 countries.\n\nHumanists International campaigns globally on human rights issues, with a specific emphasis on defending freedom of thought and expression and the rights of the non-religious, who are often a vulnerable minority in many parts of the world. The organisation is based in London but maintains a presence at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, the United Nations General Assembly in New York, and the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, among other international institutions. Its advocacy work focuses on shaping debates on issues associated with humanism, the rights of the non-religious, and promoting humanist attitudes to social issues.\n\nHumanists International is particularly active in challenging blasphemy and apostasy laws around the world and at the UN. Its annual \"Freedom of Thought Report\" indexes the world's countries by treatment of the non-religious and their commitment to freedom of thought and expression. Working with its member organisations, it also helps to coordinate support for those fleeing danger from states which persecute the non-religious. It advocates a humanist approach to various social issues, contributing to bioethical debates and arguing in favour of sexual and reproductive health and rights, LGBT rights, children's rights and women's rights, and in opposition to slavery and caste discrimination.\n\nOutside of its advocacy work, Humanists International functions as the democratic organ of the global humanist movement. It holds a general assembly each year and a World Humanist Congress usually every three years; its next World Congress will be held in Miami, United States, in 2020. Humanists International works to stimulate the growth of humanism and freethought and the spread of Enlightenment values around the world by supporting activists to form effective organisations in their home countries. In 2002, the Humanists International general assembly unanimously adopted the Amsterdam Declaration 2002, which presents as \"the official defining statement of World Humanism\". Its official symbol, the Happy Human, is shared with its member organisations worldwide.\n\nIn 2002, at the organisation's 50th anniversary World Humanist Congress, delegates unanimously passed a resolution known as the Amsterdam Declaration 2002, an update of the original Amsterdam Declaration (1952).\n\nThe Amsterdam Declaration defines Humanism as a \"lifestance\" that is \"ethical\", \"rational\", supportive of \"democracy and human rights\", insisting \"that personal liberty must be combined with social responsibility\"; it is \"an alternative to dogmatic religion\"; it values \"artistic creativity and imagination\" and is aimed at living lives of \"fulfillment\" through the powers of \"free inquiry\", \"science\" and \"creative imagination\".\n\nIn addition to the Amsterdam Declaration's \"official statement of World Humanism\", Humanists International provides a \"Minimum Statement on Humanism\":\n\nHumanism is a democratic and ethical life stance, which affirms that human beings have the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives. It stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethic based on human and other natural values in the spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities. It is not theistic, and it does not accept supernatural views of reality.\n\nMember Organisations of Humanists International are required according to its membership regulations to have objects that are \"consistent\" with this understanding of Humanism.\n\nAt the World Humanist Congress in 2005, in France, the General Assembly adopted \"The Paris Declaration 2005\", on state secularism, which states: \"There can be no freedom of conscience when religions rule societies. Secularism is the demand for equal rights for those who belong to any religion as well as for those who belong to none... For IHEU and its member organizations, the State must be secular, that is, neither religious not atheist. But demanding genuine democratic equality, recognized by the Law, between believers and humanists does not mean that the member associations of IHEU treat all philosophical points of view equally. We have no duty to respect irrationalism, however ancient its origins. True Humanism is the flourishing of freedom of conscience and the methods of free inquiry.\"\n\nIn 2007, in an \"unprecedented alliance\" of the (then) International Humanist and Ethical Union, the European Humanist Federation and Catholics for Choice, launched the Brussels Declaration, a secular response to a proposed Berlin Declaration, under which the amended EU Constitution would have made references to \"God\" and the \"Christian roots of Europe\". It made specific reference to policy positions on equality and human rights for different minority groups, concluding: \"The principles and values on which European civilisation is founded are once again under threat. We call upon the people of Europe and all who care for freedom, democracy and the rule of law to join us in promoting and protecting them.\"\n\nAt World Humanist Congress 2011, in Norway, the Humanists International General Assembly adopted \"The Oslo Declaration on Peace\", which concludes: \"We urge each of our member organizations and Humanists globally to work for a more peaceful culture in their own nations and urge all governments to prefer the peaceful settlement of conflicts over the alternative of violence and war.\"\n\nAt World Humanist Congress 2014, in the United Kingdom, the Humanists International General Assembly adopted \"The Oxford Declaration on Freedom of Thought and Expression\", which asserts: \"Freedom of thought implies the right to develop, hold, examine and manifest our beliefs without coercion, and to express opinions and a worldview whether religious or non-religious, without fear of coercion. It includes the right to change our views or to reject beliefs previously held, or previously ascribed. Pressure to conform to ideologies of the state or to doctrines of religion is a tyranny.\"\n\nIn 2017, Humanists International held a special conference on threats to humanism and liberal democracy from rising authoritarian populism and extremism as part of its general assembly in London. At the following general assembly in Auckland, New Zealand in 2018, Humanists International members agreed \"The Auckland Declaration on the Politics of Division\", which condemned a recent global resurgence of demagogy, \"exemplified in a new generation of so-called “strong men” politicians, who purport to stand up for popular interests, but who are eager to diminish human rights and disregard minorities in order to gain and retain power for their own ends\". The Declaration commits humanist organisations \"to addressing the social causes of the politics of division: social inequality, a lack of respect for human rights, popular misconceptions about the nature of democracy\" and affirms the \"values of democracy, rule of law, equality, and human rights.\"\n\nIn 2019, Humanists International members unanimously passed the Reykjavik Declaration on the Climate Change Crisis, acknowledging the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change committing the international humanist movement to \"foster a social and political commitment to urgent action and long-term policymaking to mitigate and prevent climate change.\"\n\nFive Humanist organisations, the American Ethical Union, American Humanist Association, British Ethical Union (later the British Humanist Association and now Humanists UK), Vienna Ethical Society and the Dutch Humanist League hosted the founding congress of the International Humanist and Ethical Union in Amsterdam, 22–27 August 1952. On the last day of the congress five resolutions were passed, which included a statement of the fundamentals of \"modern, ethical Humanism\", a resolution which would come to be known as the Amsterdam Declaration (1952).\n\nHumanists International is a democratic organisation, the Board of which is elected by representatives of the Member Organisations at annual General Assemblies. The President as of 2015 is Andrew Copson (who is also the Chief Executive of Humanists UK as of 2010). The IHEU headquarters is in London, sharing an office with Humanists UK.\n\nRepresentatives of Humanists International Member Organisations ratify new memberships annually during a General Assembly. Following the 2017 General Assembly, the IHEU listed its membership as 139 Member Organisations from 53 countries from a variety of non-religious traditions.\n\nA staff of four is headed by the current Chief Executive, Gary McLelland, and Humanists International maintains delegations to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, the United Nations in New York, and the Council of Europe in Strasbourg.\n\nHumanists International is an international NGO with Special Consultative Status with the United Nations, General Consultative Status at the Council of Europe, Observer Status with the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, and maintains operational relations with UNESCO.\n\nHumanists International has a wing for people aged up to 35 called the Young Humanists International.\n\nThe organization's 2017 General Assembly passed a resolution \"mandating the Board to oversee a transition to a revised identity for the organization\". The rebrand to Humanists International, a new operating name for the IHEU, was completed in February 2019.\n\nHumanists International is governed by an international board of directors, whose body is elected by member organisations at annual general assemblies, including a directly elected President.\n\nAs of July 2019, the Board of Humanists International comprises:\n\n\nThe aim of Humanists International is to \"build, support and represent the global humanist movement, defending human rights, particularly those of non-religious people, and promoting humanist values world-wide\". As a campaigning NGO Humanists International aims \"to influence international policy through representation and information, to build the humanist network, and let the world know about the worldview of Humanism.\"\n\nIn 2012 Humanists International began publishing an annual report on \"discrimination against humanists, atheists and the non-religious\" called The Freedom of Thought Report.\n\nThe report centres around a \"Country Index\" with a textual entry for every sovereign state.\n\nEach country is measured against a list of 64 boundary conditions, which are categorised into four thematic categories (\"Constitution and government\", \"Education and children's rights\", \"Family, community, society, religious courts and tribunals\", and \"Freedom of expression, advocacy of humanist values\") at five levels of overall \"severity\" (\"Free and equal\", \"Mostly satisfactory\", \"Systemic discrimination\", \"Severe discrimination\" and \"Grave violations\"). The 64 boundary conditions include for example: \"‘Apostasy’ or conversion from a specific religion is outlawed and punishable by death\", which is placed at the worst level of severity, and under the category \"Freedom of expression\", and: \"There is state funding of at least some religious schools\", which is a middle severity condition, under the category \"Education and children's rights\". The data from the report is freely available under a Creative Commons license.\n\nIn 2017, the report found that 30 countries meet at least one boundary condition at the most severe level (\"Grave violations\"), and a further 55 countries met at least one boundary condition in the next most severe level (\"Severe discrimination\").\nThe various annual editions of the Freedom of Thought Report have been reported in the media under headlines such as: \"How the right to deny the existence of God is under threat globally\" (the Independent, UK); \"Most countries fail to respect rights of atheists – report\" (Christian Today); and \"Stephen Fry's mockery of religion could land him the death penalty in these countries\" (the Washington Post). The report has received coverage in the national media of countries that are severely criticised, for example \"Malaysia's free thought, religious expression under 'serious assault', study shows\" (the Malay Mail).\n\nForewords and prefaces to the various annual editions of report have been written by then-United Nations Special Rapporteurs on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Heiner Bielefeldt, in 2012; two victims of \"blasphemy\" accusations, Kacem El Ghazzali and Alber Saber in 2013; human rights defenders Gulalai Ismail and Agnes Ojera in 2014; humanist activist and survivor of an anti-secularist machete attack in Bangladesh, Rafida Ahmed Bonya (2015); and United Nations Special Rapporteurs on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Ahmed Shaheed, in 2016. In 2015 and 2016 the annual edition of the Freedom of Thought Report was launched at the European Parliament in Brussels hosted by the European Parliamentary Intergroup on Freedom of Religion or Belief and Religious Tolerance chaired by Dennis de Jong MEP.\n\nIn his foreword to the first edition of the Freedom of Thought Report, Heiner Bielefeldt wrote: \"As a universal human right, freedom of religion or belief has a broad application. However, there seems to be little awareness that this right also provides a normative frame of reference for atheists, humanists and freethinkers and their convictions, practices and organizations. I am therefore delighted that for the first time the Humanist community has produced a global report on discrimination against atheists. I hope it will be given careful consideration by everyone concerned with freedom of religion or belief.\"\n\nAt a panel event at the European Parliament for the launch of the 2015 edition, Bielefeldt said he \"unambiguously welcomed\" the report and reiterated with regard to \"freedom of religion or belief\" that it is \"only a kind of short-hand\", and \"Formulations such as \"religious freedom\" obfuscate the scope of this human right which covers the identity-shaping, profound convictions and conviction-based practices of human beings broadly.\"\n\nThe report was the subject of a question in the UK Parliament in 2013, to which David Lidington MP responded for the government asserting, \"Our freedom of religion or belief policy is consistent with the key message of the International Humanist and Ethical Union's (IHEU) report: that international human rights law exists to protect the rights of individuals to manifest their beliefs, not to protect the beliefs themselves. The report records a sharp increase in the number of prosecutions for alleged criticism of religion by atheists on social media. Protecting freedom of expression online is a priority for the British Government and we have consistently argued against attempts to create a new international standard in order to protect religions from criticism.\"\n\nRecurring themes of Humanists International's advocacy and campaigns work include LGBTI rights and women's rights, sexual and reproductive health and rights, laws against blasphemy and apostasy, caste-based discrimination, slavery, and advocacy of secularism.\n\nIndividuals persecuted for expressing their non-religious views (actual or perceived) have frequently been the subject of IHEU campaigns. Some prominent cases include:\nThe IHEU delegation at the United Nations Human Rights Council has repeatedly raised the imprisonment and corporal punishment of Raif Badawi for \"insulting religion\", and Waleed Abulkhair for \"disrespecting the authorities\", both in Saudi Arabia.\n\nHumanists International similarly highlights cases where individuals are accused of \"apostasy\", such as the blogger Mohamed Cheikh Ould Mkhaitir currently on death row in Mauritania, and the poet Ashraf Fayadh currently imprisoned in Saudi Arabia. In June 2016 at the 32nd session of the Human Rights Council the IHEU's delegate took the unusual step of reading one of Ashraf Fayadh's poems during General Debate.\n\nHumanists International complained that fundamentalists linked to the government were \"terrorising\" secular activists, including individuals in connection with its Member Organisations, as far back as 2006. However, a series of machete attacks primarily targeting secular and atheist bloggers and freethinkers in Bangladesh has been especially severe since 2013, and the IHEU has campaigned persistently in response and highlighted the murders at the UN Human Rights Council.\n\nHumanists International responded in 2013 to the murder of blogger and activist Ahmed Rajib Haider and the machete attack on his friend Asif Mohiuddin, and highlighted the subsequent arrest and imprisonment of Mohiuddin and others for \"hurting religious sentiments\".\n\nWhen author and prominent leader of the Bengali freethought movement Avijit Roy was murdered, 26 February 2015, Humanists International revealed that he had been advising them on the situation in Bangladesh; Humanists International Director of Communications commented, \"This loss is keenly felt by freethinkers and humanists in South Asia and around the world. He was a colleague in humanism and a friend to all who respect human rights, freedom, and the light of reason.\"\n\nFollowing the murder of Washiqur Rahman Babu (or Oyasiqur Rhaman), 30 March 2015, Humanists International republished some of his final writings.\n\nFollowing the murder of Ananta Bijoy Das, 12 May 2016, Humanists International leaked parts of the letter Bijoy Das had recently received from Sweden rejecting his visa application, despite his having being invited to the country by Swedish PEN. The organisation highlighted \"the failures of the Bangladeshi authorities to bring to justice the individuals and to break the networks behind this string of targeted killings\", and also criticised Sweden's rejection of his visa application, commenting, \"We call on all countries to recognise the legitimacy and sometimes the urgency and moral necessity of asylum claims made by humanists, atheists and secularists who are being persecuted for daring to express those views.\"\n\nFollowing the murder of Niladri Chattopadhyay Niloy (or Niloy Chatterjee, also known by his pen name Niloy Neel), 7 August 2015, Humanists International again attacked the government and authorities, saying, \"Apparent failure to pursue the most obvious lines of inquiry even when initial arrests are made, and media manipulation resulting in conflicting stories, further makes reportage difficult and police operations opaque.\"\n\nA coordinated attack against two separate publishing houses in Dhaka, 31 October 2016, killed the publisher Faisal Arefin Dipon and seriously injured the publisher Ahmedur Rashid Chowdhury. The IHEU later published an interview with Chowdhury about the attack and his escape to Norway.\n\nIn August 2015 Humanists International coordinated a joint open letter in English and Bangla by a coalition of \"Bloggers, free speech campaigners, humanist associations, religious and ex-Muslim groups\" calling on the president and prime minister of Bangladesh to \"ensure the safety and security of those individuals whose lives are threatened by Islamist extremists... instruct the police to find the killers, not to harass or blame the victims... disassociate yourself publicly from those who call for death penalties against non-religious Bangladeshis...\" and repeal the laws under which secular bloggers faced arrest and imprisonment.\n\nFollowing the murder of a student and secular activist Nazimuddin Samad, 6 April 2016, and then the murder of university lecturer Professor Rezaul Karim Siddique, 23 April 2016, Humanists International president Andrew Copson said \"Unless the government [of Bangladesh] immediately begins to defend the right to speak and write freely, without adding the unprincipled and anti-secular qualifications that it keeps applying to freedom of expression, then very soon the only voices that will be heard will be those of murderous extremists.\"\n\nHumanists International, along with its Member Organisation the Dutch Humanist Association, and Hague Peace Projects, organised a \"solidarity book fair\" in The Hague, 26 February 2016, to coincide with the annual Ekushey Book Fair in Dhaka.\n\nThe range of targets for these attacks began to broaden in the later part of 2015 and throughout 2016 to more often include minority religious individuals and foreigners, culminating in the July 2016 Dhaka attack in Gulshan Thana.\n\nIn January 2015, in part as a response to the Charlie Hebdo shooting, Humanists International alongside other transnational secular groups the European Humanist Federation and Atheist Alliance International and a two-hundred strong organisational coalition, founded the End Blasphemy Laws Campaign. End Blasphemy Laws is \"campaigning to repeal \"blasphemy\" and related laws worldwide.\"\n\nThe \"First World Conference on Untouchability\" was organised by Humanists International in London, June 2009. Anticipating the event, the BBC News quoted then-Executive Director Babu Gogineni as saying that legal reforms alone would not end caste discrimination: \"There are Dalit politicians in India, but nothing has changed. The answer is to educate Dalits and empower them.\" The event was preceded by questions in the UK Parliament and guests included Lord Desai and Lord Avebury from the UK House of Lords; Binod Pahadi, Member of the Constituent Assembly, Nepal; and Tina Ramirez, US Congressional Fellow on International Religious Freedom. The Second World Conference on Untouchability was held in Kathmandu, in April 2014.\n\nIn 2013 Humanists International criticised the US-based Appeal of Conscience Foundation for awarding their \"World Statesman Award\" to then-president of Indonesia Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono; it argued that the award \"is a slap in the face to prisoners of conscience across the world. While Alexander Aan suffers in an Indonesian jail for posting his beliefs to Facebook, his jailer will be honored in New York as a champion of freedom of belief.\"\n\nIn 2014 Humanists International as part of a \"coalition of secular groups\" led a campaign around the hashtag \"#TwitterTheocracy\" to protest the social media website Twitter's implementation of tools blocking \"blasphemous\" tweets in Pakistan.\n\nThe IHEU makes a number of regular and occasional special awards.\n\nThe International Humanist Award recognises outstanding achievements and contributions to the progress and defence of Humanism.\n\n\nThe Distinguished Service to Humanism Award recognises the contributions of Humanist activists to International Humanism and to organised Humanism.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The hospital has 496 pediatric beds and is affiliated with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School. The hospital provides comprehensive pediatric specialties and subspecialties to infants, children, teens, and young adults aged 0–21 throughout Texas and surrounding regions. Children's Medical Center also sometimes treats adults that require pediatric care. Children's Medical Center Dallas also features an ACS designated Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center, 1 of 5 in the state. The hospital also has affiliations with the adjacent Parkland Memorial Hospital.\n\nChildren's Medical Center Dallas is the main hospital campus of Children's Health, the only academic healthcare system in Dallas-Fort Worth dedicated solely to the comprehensive care of children from birth to age 21. Children's Health started with just the Dallas location, but has grown to include Children's Medical Center Plano as well as several other pediatric specialty, primary care and urgent care centers located throughout North Texas.Children's Medical Center Dallas is one of the largest pediatric hospitals in the country. \n\nChildren's Medical Center Dallas traces its origins to the summer of 1913, when a group of nurses organized an open-air clinic on the lawn of the old Parkland Hospital in Dallas. The original clinic was known as the Dallas Baby Camp and treated infants up to age 3.\n\nThe nurses recognized that children received better care when it was focused only on them. In 1930, the Dallas Baby Camp grew into the Bradford Hospital for Babies, which merged with Children's Hospital of Texas and Richmond Freeman Memorial Clinic in 1948 to form what is now known as Children's Medical Center of Dallas.\n\nChildren's Medical Center affiliated with UT Southwestern Medical Center in 1964.\n\nIn 1967, administrative structures strengthened and the new campus was opened at its current day location.\n\nIn 2014, Children's Medical Center expanded into Children's Health, a system dedicated to providing all types of care for children, as well as public education about health and wellness, across its several hospitals, specialty centers, and pediatric clinics throughout North Texas.\n\nLocated at 1935 Medical District Drive in the heart of Dallas, Children's Medical Center Dallas is licensed for 490 beds and recorded more than 460,000 patient encounters in 2018.

The Madonna Della Strada Chapel is the main chapel on the Lake Shore Campus of Loyola University Chicago. The chapel was built on the lakefront with the waters of Lake Michigan directly at its front doorstep. The church was designed and built at a time when it was anticipated that Lake Shore Drive would be extended and pass directly in front, but that project was abandoned. The chapel was designed by architect Andrew Rebori in the Art Deco Style and opened its doors to the Loyola University Chicago Community in 1938. Because of scant record keeping, it is not certain which of the several artists and designers were responsible for each of the artworks and decorations at the Chapel, but Chicago's Edgar Miller did figure prominently in the process and execution of many of the works.\n\nSeveral chapel churches in Latin America were named after the chapel church in Chicago, as a tribute to Loyola University Chicago Jesuit and student missionaries.\n\nThe seven stained glass windows on the north side of the nave represents the seven colleges that existed when the Chapel was built.\n\nThe seven stained glass windows on the south side of the nave illustrate the principal ministries of the Jesuits.\n\nRenovation of Madonna della Strada began in July 2006 and concluded in August 2007. A cooling system and mechanical ventilation system were installed.\nA new pipe organ by Goulding and Wood was built and installed in 2008. The Katheryn \"Kay\" Stamm Memorial Organ has 70 ranks distributed over three manuals and pedal and played via a terraced console located in the rear gallery.\n\nThe chapel hosts an annual \"Midnight Organ Blast\" at midnight on Halloween, featuring eerie melodies.\n\nThe Loyola University Department of Sacramental Life hosts a series of free organ concerts on the third Sunday of each month.\n\n\n"}

Trimetazidine is described as the first cytoprotective anti-ischemic agent developed and marketed by Laboratoires Servier (France). Trimetazidine is an anti-ischemic (anti-anginal) metabolic agent, which improves myocardial glucose utilization through inhibition of fatty acid metabolism, also known as fatty acid oxidation inhibitor.\n\nTrimetazidine is usually prescribed as a long-term treatment of angina pectoris, and in some countries (including France) for tinnitus and dizziness. It is taken twice a day. In 2012 European Medicines Agency (EMA) finished a review of benefits and risks of trimetazidine and recommended restricting use of trimetazidine-containing medicines just as an additional treatment of angina pectoris in case of inadequate control by or intolerance to first-line antianginal therapies.\n\nControlled studies in angina patients have shown that trimetazidine increases coronary flow reserve, thereby delaying the onset of ischemia associated with exercise, limits rapid swings in blood pressure without any significant variations in heart rate, significantly decreases the frequency of angina attacks, and leads to a significant decrease in the use of nitrates.\n\nIt improves left ventricular function in diabetic patients with coronary heart disease. Recently, it has been shown to be effective in patients with heart failure of different etiologies.\n\nTrimetazidine is among the performance enhancing drugs prohibited in athletics by the World Anti-Doping Agency. In 2014, Chinese Olympic champion swimmer Sun Yang was caught with a urine test and banned by the Chinese Swimming Association for 3 months.\n\nTrimetazidine has been treated as a drug with a high safety and tolerability profile. It interacts with monoamine oxidase inhibitors.\n\nThere is scarce information about trimetazidine's effect on mortality, cardiovascular events or quality of life. Long term randomized controlled trials comparing trimetazidine against standard anti-anginal agents, using clinically important outcomes would be justifiable. Recently, an international multicentre retrospective cohort study has indeed shown that in patients with heart failure of different etiologies, the addition of trimetazidine on conventional optimal therapy can improve mortality and morbidity.\n\nEMA recommends that doctors should no longer prescribe trimetazidine for the treatment of patients with tinnitus, vertigo or disturbances in vision. The recent EMA evaluation also revealed rare cases (3.6/1 000 000 patient years) of Parkinsonian (or extrapyramidal) symptoms (such as tremor, rigidity, akinesia, hypertonia), gait instability, restless leg syndrome, other related movement disorders, majority of patient recovered within 4 months after treatment discontinuation, therefore, doctors are advised not to prescribe the medicine either to patients with Parkinson disease, parkinsonian symptoms, tremors, restless leg syndrome or other related movement disorders, nor to patients with severe renal impairment.\n\nTrimetazidine inhibits beta-oxidation of fatty acids by blocking long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, which enhances glucose oxidation. In an ischaemic cell, energy obtained during glucose oxidation requires less oxygen consumption than in the beta-oxidation process. Potentiation of glucose oxidation optimizes cellular energy processes, thereby maintaining proper energy metabolism during ischaemia. By preserving energy metabolism in cells exposed to hypoxia or ischaemia, trimetazidine prevents a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, thereby ensuring the proper functioning of ionic pumps and transmembrane sodium-potassium flow whilst maintaining cellular homeostasis.\n\nTrimetazidine is distributed under many brand names: 3 Kat, Adexor, Aiyiling, Angimax, Angimet, Anginox, Angintriz, Angiozil, Angirel, Angirid, Angitrim, Angivas, Angivent, Antoris, ApoTrimet, Apstar, Atanol, Bustidin, Cardimax, Carvidon, Curime, Cyto-Protectin, Cytogard, Dilatan, Dimesar, Domisin, Energotrim, Feelnor, Idaptan, Imovexil, Intervein, Invidon, Kardin, Liomagen, Matenol, Metacard, Metacardia, Metagard, Metazydyna, Mezitan, Miozidine, Moduxin, Neotri, Novazidine, Portora, Prectazidine, Predizin, Predozone, Preductal, Predutrim, Preduxl, Protevasc, Rimecor, Setal, Sitorel, Tacirel, Tazidinol, Tazz, TevaTrim, TMZ, Triacyt, Tricardia, Tricoz, Triguard, Trimductal, Trimecard, Trimeductan, Trimektal, Trimeluzine, Trimepect, Trimerel, Trimet, Trimetacor, Trimetaratio, Trimetazidin, Trimetazidinã, Trimetazidine, Trimetazidinum, Trimetazigen, Trimetazydyna, Trimezar, Trimpol, Trizedon, Trizid, Trizidine, Tryme, Vascotasin, Vascotazin, Vashasan, Vasorel, Vasotrim, Vaspycar, Vastar, Vastarel, Vastazid, Vastinan, Vastinol, Vastor, Vestar, Vosfarel, Whilst, Ze Wei Er, Zidimet, Zidin, Zidmetin, Zilutra, and Zimetin.\n\n"}

They fall into two categories: \n\nThe first websites were created in the early 1990s. These sites were manually written in HTML.\n\nOver time, software was created to help design web pages: \"e.g.\" Microsoft released FrontPage in November 1995.\n\nBy 1998, Dreamweaver had been established as the industry leader; however, some have criticized the quality of the code produced by such software as being overblown and reliant on tables. As the industry moved towards W3C standards, Dreamweaver and others were criticized for not being compliant. Compliance has improved over time, but many professionals still prefer to write optimized markup by hand.\n\nOpen source tools were typically developed to the standards, and made fewer exceptions for the then-dominant Internet Explorer's deviations from the standards.\n\nThe W3C started Amaya in 1996 to showcase Web technologies in a fully featured Web client. This was to provide a framework that integrated lots of W3C technologies in a single, consistent environment. Amaya started as an HTML and CSS editor and now supports XML, XHTML, MathML, and SVG.\n\nGeoCities was one of the first more modern site builders that didn't require any technical skills. Five years after its launch in 1994 Yahoo! purchased it for $3.6 billion. After becoming obsolescent, it was shut down in April 2009.\n\nOnline website builders typically require customers to sign up with the web hosting company. Some companies provide examples of fully functional websites made with their website builder. The range of services varies anywhere between creating basic personal web pages or social network content to making complete business and e-commerce websites, either template based or, on the more flexible platforms, totally design free.\n\nThe main advantage of an online website builder is that it is quick and easy to use, and often does not require prior experience. Often, a website can be built and be up and running live on the Internet quickly. Technical support is usually provided, as are how-to video and help files. Though there are many general websites builders you can easily find an online website builder created especially for a specific niche (dating, medical etc.) with features needed for this niche.\n\nHTML tools are divided into those that allow editing of the source code and those that only have a WYSIWYG mode.\n\nOffline web builders cater to professional web designers who need to create pages for more than one client or web host. Modern offline web builders are usually both WYSIWYG and allow direct editing of source code and cascading style sheets (CSS) styling. They generally require at least a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. Although they are more flexible than online builders, many proprietary offline website builder software can be expensive, however, there are also many open-source website builders.\n\n"}

{"id": "2038819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038819", "title": "Microwave landing system", "text": "Microwave landing system\n\nThe microwave landing system (MLS) is an all-weather, precision radio guidance system intended to be installed at large airports to assist aircraft in landing, including 'blind landings'. MLS enables an approaching aircraft to determine when it's aligned with the destination runway and on the correct glidepath for a safe landing. MLS was intended to replace or supplement the instrument landing systems (ILS). MLS has a number of operational advantages over ILS, including a wider selection of channels to avoid interference with nearby installations, excellent performance in all weather, a small \"footprint\" at the airports, and wide vertical and horizontal \"capture\" angles that allowed approaches from wider areas around the airport.\n\nAlthough some MLS systems became operational in the 1990s, the widespread deployment envisioned by some aviation agencies never became a reality. There were two reasons: (economic) while technically superior to ILS, MLS did not offer sufficiently greater capabilities to justify adding MLS receivers to aircraft equipage; and (potentially superior third system) GPS-based systems, notably WAAS, allowed the expectation of a similar level of positioning with no equipment needed at the airport. GPS/WAAS dramatically lowers an airport's cost of implementing precision landing approaches, which is particularly important at small airports. For these reasons, most existing MLS systems in North America have been turned off. GPS/WAAS-based LPV 'Localizer Performance with Vertical guidance' approaches provide vertical guidance comparable to ILS Category I and FAA-published LPV approaches currently outnumber ILS approaches at US airports. \n\nThough initially MLS appeared to be of interest in Europe, where concerns over the availability of GPS were an issue, widespread installation never occurred. Further deployment of the system is not likely. Rather, several European airports have implemented LPV approaches based on the EGNOS (WAAS-compatible) satellite system.\n\nNASA operated a similar system called the Microwave Scanning Beam Landing System to land the Space Shuttle orbiter.\n\nMLS employs 5 GHz transmitters at the landing place which use passive electronically scanned arrays to send scanning beams towards approaching aircraft. An aircraft that enters the scanned volume uses a special receiver that calculates its position by measuring the arrival times of the beams.\n\nThe US version of MLS, a joint development between the FAA, NASA, and the U.S. Department of Defense, was designed to provide precision navigation guidance for exact alignment and descent of aircraft on approach to a runway. It provides azimuth, elevation, and distance, as well as \"back azimuth\" for navigating away from an aborted landing or missed approach. MLS channels were also used for short-range communications with airport controllers, allowing long-distance frequencies to be handed over to other aircraft.\n\nIn Australia, design work commenced on a version of MLS in 1972. Most of this work was done jointly by the Federal Department of Civil Aviation (DCA), and the Radio Physics Division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). The project was called Interscan, one of several microwave landing systems under consideration internationally. Interscan was chosen by the FAA in 1975 and by ICAO in 1978 as the format to be adopted. An engineered version of the system, called MITAN, was developed by industry (Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited and Hawker de Havilland) under a contract with DCA's successor, the Department of Transport, and successfully demonstrated at Melbourne Airport (Tullamarine) in the late 1970s. The white antenna dishes could still be seen at Tullamarine until 2003 when they were dismantled.\n\nThis initial research was followed by the formation of Interscan International limited in Sydney, Australia in 1979 which manufactured MLS systems that were subsequently deployed in the US, EU, Taiwan, China and Australia. The Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom) developed a version of MLS, which is installed at Heathrow Airport and other airports, because of the greater incidence of instrument approaches with Cat II/III weather.\n\nCompared with the existing instrument landing system (ILS), MLS had significant advantages. The antennas were much smaller, using a higher frequency signal. They also did not have to be placed at a specific location at the airport, and could \"offset\" their signals electronically. This made placement easier compared with the physically larger ILS systems, which \"had to be placed at the ends of the runways and along the approach path\".\n\nAnother advantage was that the MLS signals covered a very wide fan-shaped area off the end of the runway, allowing controllers to direct aircraft approaching from a variety of directions or guide aircraft along a segmented approach. In comparison, ILS could only guide the aircraft down a single straight line, requiring controllers to distribute planes along that line. MLS allowed aircraft to approach from whatever direction they were already flying in, as opposed to flying to a parking orbit before \"capturing\" the ILS signal. This was particularly valuable at larger airports, as it could allow the aircraft to be separated horizontally much closer to the airport. Similarly in elevation, the fan shaped coverage allows for variations in descent rate, making MLS useful for aircraft with steeper approach angles such as helicopters, fighters and the space shuttle.\n\nUnlike ILS, which required a variety of frequencies to broadcast the various signals, MLS used a single frequency, broadcasting the azimuth and altitude information one after the other. This reduced the chance of frequency conflicts, as did the fact that the frequencies used were far away from FM broadcasts, another problem with ILS. MLS also offered two hundred separate channels, making conflicts between airports in the same area easily preventable.\n\nFinally, the accuracy was greatly improved over ILS. For instance, standard DME equipment used with ILS offered range accuracy of only ±1200 feet. MLS improved this to ±100 ft in what they referred to as DME/P (for precision), and offered similar improvements in azimuth and altitude. This allowed MLS to guide extremely accurate CAT III approaches, whereas this normally required an expensive ground-based high precision radar.\n\nSimilar to other precision landing systems, lateral and vertical guidance may be displayed on conventional course deviation indicators or incorporated into multipurpose cockpit displays. Range information can also be displayed by conventional DME indicators and also incorporated into multipurpose displays.\n\nIt was originally intended that ILS would remain in operation until 2010 before being replaced by MLS. The system was only being installed experimentally in the 1980s when the FAA began to favor GPS. Even in the worst cases, GPS offered at least 300 ft accuracy, not as good as MLS, but much better than ILS. GPS also worked \"everywhere\", not just off the end of the runways. This meant that a single navigation instrument could replace both short and long-range navigation systems, offer better accuracy than either, and required no ground-based equipment.\n\nThe performance of GPS, namely vertical guidance accuracy near the runway threshold and the integrity of the system have not been able to match historical ICAO standards and practices. Greater GPS accuracy could be provided by sending out \"correcting signals\" from ground-based stations, which would improve the accuracy to about 10 m in the worst case, far outperforming MLS. Initially it was planned to send these signals out over short-range FM transmissions on commercial radio frequencies, but this proved to be too difficult to arrange. Today a similar signal is instead sent across all of North America via commercial satellites, in a system known as WAAS. However WAAS is not capable of providing CAT II or CAT III standard signals (those required for autolanding) and so a Local Area Augmentation System, or LAAS, must be used.\n\nThe system may be divided into five functions: Approach azimuth, Back azimuth, Approach elevation, Range and Data communications.\n\nThe azimuth station transmits MLS angle and data on one of 200 channels within the frequency range of 5031 to 5090.7 MHz and is normally located about 1,000 feet (300 m) beyond the stop end of the runway, but there is considerable flexibility in selecting sites. For example, for heliport operations the azimuth transmitter can be collocated with the elevation transmitter. \n\nThe azimuth coverage extends: Laterally, at least 40 degrees on either side of the runway centerline in a standard configuration. In elevation, up to an angle of 15 degrees and to at least 20,000 feet (6 km), and in range, to at least 20 nautical miles (37 km) (See FIG 1-1-8.)\n\nThe elevation station transmits signals on the same frequency as the azimuth station. A single frequency is time-shared between angle and data functions and is normally located about 400 feet from the side of the runway between runway threshold and the touchdown zone.\n\nElevation coverage is provided in the same airspace as the azimuth guidance signals: In elevation, to at least +15 degrees; Laterally, to fill the Azimuth lateral coverage and in range, to at least 20 nautical miles (37 km) (See FIG 1-1-9.)\n\nThe MLS Precision Distance Measuring Equipment (DME/P) functions in the same way as the navigation DME, but there are some technical differences. The beacon transponder operates in the frequency band 962 to 1105 MHz and responds to an aircraft interrogator. The MLS DME/P accuracy is improved to be consistent with the accuracy provided by the MLS azimuth and elevation stations. \n\nA DME/P channel is paired with the azimuth and elevation channel. A complete listing of the 200 paired channels of the DME/P with the angle functions is contained in FAA Standard 022 (MLS Interoperability and Performance Requirements). \n\nThe DME/N or DME/P is an integral part of the MLS and is installed at all MLS facilities unless a waiver is obtained. This occurs infrequently and only at outlying, low density airports where marker beacons or compass locators are already in place.\n\nThe data transmission can include both the basic and auxiliary data words. All MLS facilities transmit basic data. Where needed, auxiliary data can be transmitted. MLS data are transmitted throughout the azimuth (and back azimuth when provided) coverage sectors. Representative data include: Station identification, Exact locations of azimuth, elevation and DME/P stations (for MLS receiver processing functions), Ground equipment performance level; and DME/P channel and status. \n\nMLS identification is a four-letter designation starting with the letter M. It is transmitted in International Morse Code at least six times per minute by the approach azimuth (and back azimuth) ground equipment.\n\nAuxiliary data content: Representative data include: 3-D locations of MLS equipment, Waypoint coordinates, Runway conditions and Weather (e.g., RVR, ceiling, altimeter setting, wind, wake vortex, wind shear).\n\nIn the United States, the FAA suspended the MLS program in 1994 in favor of the GPS (Wide Area Augmentation System WAAS). The FAA's inventory of instrument flight procedures no longer includes any MLS locations; the last two were eliminated in 2008. \n\nDue to different operational conditions in Europe many countries (particularly those known for low visibility conditions) were expected to embrace the MLS system as a replacement to ILS. However, in reality the only major installation was London Heathrow Airport, which was decommissioned on the 31st of May 2017. Other major airports, such as Frankfurt Airport which were expected to install MLS have instead published ground-based augmentation system (GBAS) approaches.\n\nAs more GBAS system are installed, then the further installation of MLS or continued operation of existing systems must be in doubt.\n\n\n\n"}

It was named in 1691 for Dr. Thomas Wynne, William Penn's physician and the first Speaker of the Pennsylvania General Assembly. Lower Merion Township is the fifth-most-affluent jurisdiction in the United States. Wynnewood is one of many neighborhoods on the historic Pennsylvania Main Line, and is the home of institutions such as Lankenau Hospital, St. Charles Borromeo Seminary, Palmer Theological Seminary, and Friends' Central School.\n\nWynnewood is neither an incorporated area nor a census-designated place; all data is for its ZIP code 19096. As of 2010 Census, there were 13,572 people and 5,436 households residing in the community. In 2000, the population density was 3,882 people per square mile. The racial makeup of the community was 92.9% White, 3.2% Asian, 2.5% African American, 0.40% from other races, and 1.0% from two or more races. 1.2% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.\n\nThe median income for a household in the community was $86,861, and the median income for a family was $111,683. The per capita income for the community was $51,543. About 0.9% of families and 2.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 7.7% of those under age 18 and 10.1% of those age 65 or over.\n\nResidents of Wynnewood cooperate with those of adjacent Ardmore in many ways, one of which is the ArdWood Civic Association. South Ardmore Park is partly in Wynnewood, and partly in Ardmore. This park is the site of a free or low-cost summer camp, sporting activities, walking paths, and a verdant setting.\n\nWynnewood itself is mostly residential, with its shopping in various clusters. The largest shopping center in Wynnewood is the Wynnewood Shopping Center housing an Old Navy, Bed Bath and Beyond, Mad Mex, DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse (formerly Borders Book Store) and (formerly Genuardi's) Giant, John Troncelliti Barber Shop, Gamestop, and several eateries and smaller stores. Other shopping venues in the suburb include Wynnewood Square and the Whole Foods Shopping Center (named for a market there), both on East Lancaster Avenue. As Wynnewood is primarily a residential community, its residents visit other districts of the Main Line, such as Ardmore or Narberth, for shopping.\n\nAlong with its tree-shaded streets and mature old stone homes, Wynnewood has also been known historically for its car dealerships, which line Lancaster Avenue from South Wynnewood to Argyle Road. Gracious, old-fashioned restaurants, Stouffer's and the Viking Inn, both on Lancaster Avenue, have disappeared and not been replaced, although less expensive fare is widely available. The town's only movie theater, the Eric Wynnewood, became Vinny T's in 2000, became a Buca di Beppo in late 2010, and has now become a location for PM Pediatrics, a pediatric specialized urgent care that is open until midnight 7 days a week.\n\nOpposite the Wynnewood Shopping Center is the Wynnewood train station. Built in the 1870s, the vintage regional rail (SEPTA) train station (MP 7.5) was designed by Wilson Brothers and Company for the Pennsylvania Railroad. Towns on the lower \"Main Line\" adjacent to Wynnewood include Overbrook, Merion, Narberth, Ardmore, Haverford, and Bryn Mawr. The SEPTA Route 105 bus runs along the length of Lancaster Avenue on the Main Line, and the SEPTA Route 44 bus supplements the trains for service between nearby Ardmore and Narberth and Center City Philadelphia. South Wynnewood is served by the SEPTA Norristown High-Speed Line (former Route 100),which runs from the Montgomery County seat of Norristown through the central and eastern Main Line to 69th Street Transportation Center and connections to the Market-Frankford Line for service to Center City and Northeast Philadelphia.\n\nWynnewood is located along Lancaster Avenue (U.S. Route 30) and is also easily accessible from nearby Interstate Routes 76 (the Schuylkill Expressway east and west) and 476 (the Philadelphia bypass nicknamed the \"Blue Route\", traveling south and north between Chester and Interstate 95 in the south and Plymouth Meeting, Germantown, and the east-west Pennsylvania Turnpike in the north).\n\nWynnewood is also home to one the principal three teaching hospitals that serve Philadelphia's Main Line. Along with the eponymous Bryn Mawr and Paoli Memorial hospitals, Lankenau Hospital, on Lancaster Avenue (Route 30) in Wynnewood near the Overbrook border, has traditionally been affiliated with either Jefferson or Drexel colleges of medicine and is always (with Bryn Mawr and Paoli) on the list of the nation's top community hospitals. Saunders House, a rehabilitation facility, can be found on Lankenau's premises, as is a large and busy medical office building that is home to many of the private practices of the hospital's attending physicians.\n\nMuch of Wynnewood's public school children attend the Merion, Penn Wynne or Penn Valley elementary schools, part of Lower Merion School District headquartered in nearby Admore; Bala Cynwyd Middle School; and have a choice between Lower Merion High School and Harriton High School. Other schools, private and parochial, abound in this old and affluent residential district, including all-boys The Haverford School, all-girls Baldwin and Agnes Irwin schools, coeducational Friends Central School — actually within the Wynnewood postal district — and private, Catholic, Country Day School of the Sacred Heart in nearby Bryn Mawr, Waldron Mercy and Merion Mercy academies in nearby Merion. Saint Margaret's Elementary School in nearby Narberth also serves Wynnewood's Catholic elementary school community. There are other private schools such as Episcopal Academy (Merion), as well as Jack M. Barrack Hebrew Academy (Bryn Mawr) and the Solomon Schechter School (Wynnewood), which are both Jewish-affiliated schools. Finally, there is a French International School which has two locations—the lower school near the Bala Cynwyd Library and the upper school on City Avenue, still in Bala Cynwyd.\n\nSaint Joseph's University is close by with parts of its campus in Merion, Bala Cynwyd and West Philadelphia; Villanova University, straddling Lancaster Avenue, and Rosemont College, on Montgomery, are also nearby, as are Cabrini College and Eastern University, both in nearby Saint David's. Haverford College is a non-denominational college on Montgomery Avenue in Haverford. St. Charles Borromeo Seminary is across the street from parts of Saint Joseph's University's campus.\n\nThe Japanese Language School of Philadelphia (JLSP, フィラデルフィア日本語補習授業校 \"Firaderufia Nihongo Hoshū Jugyō Kō\"), a supplementary Japanese school, holds its classes at the Friends Central School (FCS) in Wynnewood and in Lower Merion Township.\n\nThe area is covered by \"The Main Line Times\".\n\nThe well-regarded 1962 dramatic film \"David and Lisa\" is said to have been filmed in part at and around the Wynnewood train station.\n\nAlso located in the community is Shortridge Memorial Park, a small park in a creek valley with stone bridges under which Indian Creek flows. The Indian Creek district has been ecologically revitalized and restored. Wynnewood residents are active in the Wynnewood Civic Association and the Shortridge Association of Wynnewood. There is also a Wynnewood Valley Park Sensory Garden which is an attraction for those who are visually and non-visually impaired.\n\n\n"}

It is located on Nicollet Island.\n\nDeLaSalle opened in 1900 and has been administered by the Christian Brothers throughout its history. The school's current president is Barry Lieske, AFSC. Lieske has been an administrator at DeLaSalle since 1982 and has served as principal (chief operations officer) from 1993–2012. Enrollment peaked at 1654 boys in 1964, dropped to the range of 400–500 by the early 1970s despite the 1971–72 advent of co-education, and continued to decline to a 70-year low of 306 in 1991. Over the past two decades DeLaSalle's enrollment has climbed, and the school now receives an average of 400 applications each year for ninth grade admission. Strategic plans from 2000, 2007, 2012 and 2017 are based upon an optimum overall enrollment of 750–800 students.\n\nThen-Archbishop John Ireland helped raise money in the late 1800s to build the new Catholic secondary school in Minneapolis. Ireland's goal was to provide education to sons of immigrants who were moving into Minneapolis neighborhoods from many European countries. Only a few months after groundbreaking, the \"DeLaSalle Institute\" building was ready for occupancy. Fifty boys joined three teaching Christian Brothers in the new school in October 1900. The number of pupils rapidly expanded, and by spring, a fourth Brother had arrived to handle the overcrowding. By 1907, an addition had been added to the original building, and in 1914, the Archdiocese, at Archbishop Ireland's direction, purchased the adjoining King property to provide space for eventual expansion. Enrollment stood at 352 boys.\n\nIn those early days, DeLaSalle was a commercial school. Through the work of Brother Hercules, the first graduating class, 13 members strong in 1903, all received positions with the leading business firms of Minneapolis before graduating.\n\nBy 1920, parents were calling for a high school that was primarily college preparatory. So Archbishop Dowling, Ireland's successor, went to all Minneapolis parishes to raise the $200,000 needed to build a new high school on the former King property, adjacent to the existing commercial building. Construction began in May 1922, and within a year, the new DeLaSalle High School building (today known as the \"B Building\") had opened. Within six years, DeLaSalle was accredited as college preparatory by both the University of Minnesota and the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. (More than eight decades later, the school is still accredited by AdvancEd, the successor to North Central.)\n\nBy 1950, enrollment was growing significantly each year, so much so that ninth graders were being educated in a separate building at West 43rd Street and Wentworth Avenue in south Minneapolis. The school's administration opened a new residence for the Christian Brothers in 1950, facing Grove Street on the back side of the DeLaSalle campus. In 1960, in order to \"bring the freshmen back to the Island,\" the school opened the third classroom building on campus (today known as the \"A building\"). The original school building stood until February 1971, when a weekend electrical fire damaged much of the structure. Because enrollment was dropping precipitously at the time, the original building was razed and not replaced.\n\nIn order to meet emerging educational and facility needs for a growing student body, in 2014 the DeLaSalle Board of Trustees authorized the construction of a new building. With funds and pledges raised from an ongoing five-year capital campaign run by the school's president, Barry Lieske, and the development office staff, DeLaSalle opened the new \"D building\" when the 2016–17 school year began. The centerpiece of the project is the \"Center for Innovative Learning,\" new learning spaces providing teachers and students enhanced educational technology and facilities that integrate more efficiently with the tablet- and cloud-technology used by all students. Within the project's scope, DeLaSalle also was able to replace decades-old boiler and electrical systems, improve the energy efficiency of the entire campus, enhance traffic circulation with new corridors and a new north-side entry, and relocate athletic and theatre / fine arts functions closer to the gymnasiums, athletic field, and auditorium respectively.\n\nIn the Strategic Plan of 1993 the school focused its curriculum only on college preparatory classes, in large part to maximize resources that could be available for financial assistance for families. To this day, graduation requirements mirror typical college entrance requirements, plus requirements for completion of Christian Service hours and Theology coursework. Placement is available in one of two levels within a department: Honors/Advanced Placement or regular college prep, with 13 different AP courses available to students. Since 2000, over 98 percent of each graduating class has matriculated to college. De graduates are enrolled in colleges in 36 states.\n\nThe school was founded to provide a Catholic school option to poor and immigrant families (primarily European) moving into Minneapolis in the late 19th century. This mission continues to this day, to provide a Catholic and college preparatory education to students from all family and socio-economic backgrounds. The school provides over $3.0 million of financial assistance to assist 53 percent of its students with reduced tuition. In addition to its socio-economic diversity, DeLaSalle is the most diverse Catholic School in the state of Minnesota as measured by almost all demographic areas: 45% of its students are people of color, 35% matriculate from single-parent households, and 33% have been raised in faiths other than Catholic.\n\nThe student body of 760 is drawn from over 120 parochial and public grade schools across the Twin Cities. Over 85 students were born in other countries, some attending DeLaSalle because of its proximity to the University of Minnesota. DeLaSalle has launched an innovative Global Advantage Program, partnering with Hamline University, St. Mary's University, St. Catherine's University, and the University of Minnesota in areas of international academic travel and student exchange experiences.\n\nDeLaSalle is one of 13 Catholic high schools in the Twin Cities, one of two within the city limits of Minneapolis.\n\nOver 90 percent of DeLaSalle students participate in at least one school activity each year, and more than 75 percent will join two or more. Academic, fine arts, athletic and leadership/service groups and teams all are available to students. The largest activities in terms of participation are theatre (six productions each year), music (both vocal and instrumental programs), and Lasallian \"Campus\" Ministry.\n\nSince 2000, teams or individuals from DeLaSalle have qualified for participation in the MSHSL's championship tournaments in speech, one-act play, boys' and girls' basketball, football, boys' soccer, boys' and girls' track-and-field, wrestling, cross country, and baseball. DeLaSalle students have succeeded in other programs not directed by the MSHSL, including competitive cheer (eight state titles), Quiz Bowl (eleven straight years qualifying for the National Championships), and musical theatre (20 group or individual awards earned in the annual Spotlight Program of the Hennepin Theatre Trust in 2017). Of note, nearly 45 percent of the students are in a music program, one of three bands, two choirs or orchestra.\n\nDeLaSalle is a member of the Tri-Metro Conference, a mix of private and public high schools throughout the Twin Cities that sponsors competitions, leadership programs, and other collaborative activities.\n\nOver its history, several dozen DeLaSalle alums have continued to participate in college athletic and arts programs, many with scholarship support from their colleges.\n\n\n\n"}

Grant\n\nJedediah Morgan Grant (February 21, 1816 – December 1, 1856) was a leader and an apostle of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He was member of the First Council of the Seventy from 1845 to 1854 and served in the First Presidency under church president Brigham Young from 1854 to 1856. He is known for his fiery speeches during the Reformation of 1856, earning the nickname \"Brigham's Sledgehammer\". Grant is the father of Heber J. Grant, who later served as President of the Church.\n\nJedediah M. Grant was born February 21, 1816, to Joshua Grant and Athalia Howard in Windsor, New York. He was baptized into the Church of Christ by John F. Boyington on March 21, 1833, at age 17. By age 18, he had participated in Zion's Camp, marching from Kirtland, Ohio, to Missouri under the direction of Joseph Smith. Though the physical objectives of the march were not met, many members later became leaders in Smith's church. Grant's close relationship with these men from such an early age would last the rest of his life.\n\nGrant was among the first Latter Day Saint missionaries to go to Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia. His preaching efforts in the Toms River area of New Jersey in the late 1830s led to the conversion of members of the Ivins family.\n\nGrant was one of a group of men (which also included Brigham Young, Wilford Woodruff and George A. Smith) who were called in 1844 to campaign for Smith's election to President of the United States.\n\nAfter Smith's death, Grant was called to serve as a President of the Seventy. As a Seventy, he assisted with the trek westwards and the settling of the Salt Lake Valley. He would later become the first mayor of Salt Lake City, Utah, serving in that position from 1851 until his death. Morgan County, Utah, and Morgan, Utah, are both named for him. In 1854, Grant was ordained an apostle, but he did not become a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Instead, he was called to the First Presidency as Young's Second Counselor, filling the vacancy left by the death of Willard Richards.\n\nGrant served in the Utah Territorial Council in 1851.\n\nIn 1856, Grant was called by Young to tour the northern sections of Utah Territory, calling the Latter-day Saints to repentance. Grant inspired the Mormon Reformation of 1856 as he delivered fiery speeches on this tour. He issued a call for rebaptism of all the members of the area. Grant's speeches earned him the title \"Brigham's Sledgehammer.\" The effects of his speeches were felt almost immediately; members throughout the area, as well as in distant parts, were rebaptized to signify their commitment to renew their commitments to the LDS Church and the gospel. Several of these speeches are recorded in \"Journal of Discourses\".\n\nGrant contracted pneumonia after his vigorous tour. He died on December 1, 1856, just nine days after his son, Heber J. Grant, was born to his wife Rachel Ridgeway Ivins. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.\n\nLike many early Mormons, Grant practiced plural marriage. He had a total of seven wives, among them Susan Fairchild Noble Grant, who wrote reminiscences of early life in Utah and was a leader in the Relief Society after Grant died. By his wives, Grant had 11 children (10 biological, one adopted). His son, Heber, became the LDS Church's seventh president.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2038823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038823", "title": "Leatherman (vagabond)", "text": "Leatherman (vagabond)\n\nThe Leatherman (ca. 1839–1889) was a particular vagabond, famous for his handmade leather suit of clothes, who traveled a circuit between the Connecticut River and the Hudson River, roughly from 1857 to 1889. Of unknown origin, he was thought to be French-Canadian, because of his fluency in the French language, his \"broken English\", and the French-language prayer book found on his person after his death. His identity remains unknown, and controversial. He walked a 365-mile route year after year. His repeating route took him to certain towns in western Connecticut and eastern New York, returning to each town every 34–36 days.\n\nLiving in rock shelters and \"leatherman caves\", as they are now locally known, he stopped at towns along his 365-mile loop about every five weeks for food and supplies. He was dubbed the \"Leatherman\" as his adornment of hat, scarf, clothes, and shoes were handmade leather.\nAn early article in the Burlington Free Press, dating to April 7th, 1870 refers to him as the \"Leather-Clad Man\", it also states that he spoke rarely and when addressed would simply speak in monosyllables. According to contemporary rumors, he hailed from Picardy, France.\n\nFluent in French, he communicated mostly with grunts and gestures, rarely using his broken English. When asked about his background, he would abruptly end the conversation. Upon his death, a French prayer book was found among his possessions. He declined meat on Fridays, giving rise to speculation that he was Roman Catholic.\n\nIt is unknown how he earned money. One store kept a record of an order: \"one loaf of bread, a can of sardines, one-pound of fancy crackers, a pie, two quarts of coffee, one gill of brandy and a bottle of beer\".\n\nLeatherman was popular in Connecticut. He was reliable in his rounds, and people would have food ready for him, which he often ate on their doorsteps. Ten towns along the Leatherman's route passed ordinances exempting him from the state \"tramp law\" passed in 1879.\n\nThe Leatherman survived blizzards and other foul weather by heating his rock shelters with fire. Indeed, while his face was reported to be frostbitten at times during the winter, by the time of his death he had not lost any fingers, unlike other tramps of the time and area. The Connecticut Humane Society had him arrested and hospitalized in 1888, which resulted in a diagnosis of \"sane except for an emotional affliction\" and release, as he had money and desired freedom. His ultimate demise was from cancer of the mouth due to tobacco use. His body was found on March 24, 1889 in his Saw Mill Woods cave on the farm of George Dell in the town of Mount Pleasant, New York near Ossining, New York.\n\nHis grave is in the Sparta Cemetery, Route 9, Ossining, New York. The following inscription was carved on his original tombstone:\nFINAL RESTING PLACE OF<br>\nJules Bourglay<br>\nOF LYONS, FRANCE<br>\n\"THE LEATHER MAN\"<br>\nwho regularly walked a 365-mile route<br>\nthrough Westchester and Connecticut from<br>\nthe Connecticut River to the Hudson<br>\nliving in caves in the years<br>\n1858–1889<br>\nHis grave was moved further from Route 9. When the first grave was dug up, no traces were found of the Leatherman's remains, only some coffin nails, which were reburied in a new pine box, along with dirt from the old grave site. Nicholas Bellantoni, a University of Connecticut archaeologist and the supervisor of the excavation, cited time, the effect of traffic over the shallow original gravesite, and possible removal of graveside material by a road-grading project for the complete destruction of hard and soft tissue in the grave. The new tombstone, installed May 25, 2011, simply reads, \"The Leatherman.\"\n\nThe Leatherman's former tombstone read, \"Final resting place of Jules Bourglay of Lyons, France, 'The Leather Man'…\", and he is identified with that name in many accounts. However, according to researchers, including Dan W. DeLuca, and his New York death certificate, his identity remains unknown. This name first appeared in a story published in the \"Waterbury Daily American\", August 16, 1884, but was later retracted March 25, 26 and 27, 1889 and also in \"The Meriden Daily Journal\", March 29, 1889. DeLuca was able to get a new headstone installed, when the Leatherman's grave was moved away from Route 9 to another location within the cemetery on May 25, 2011. The new brass plaque simply reads \"The Leatherman.\"\n\nThe Leatherman's original grave in Sparta Cemetery was within 16 feet of Route 9. His remains were exhumed and were reburied at a different site in the cemetery on May 25, 2011. No visible remains were recovered during the exhumation. Rather, coffin nails and soil recovered from the original burial plot were reburied at the new site. Part of the reason for the exhumation process was to test his remains to determine his origins. He had been rumored to be of French descent but there were several conflicting reports.\n\nHis circuit took in the following towns:\n\nMany of the locations on Leatherman's route in Connecticut and New York have geocaches as well as letterboxes near them.\n\n\n"}

Some countries have completed a Digital television transition.\n\nMore information on the premise of digital broadcasting was published in the 2002 edition of the World Radio TV Handbook.\n\nDigital broadcasting has been helped greatly by the presence of computers. In fact, with the invention of the integrated circuit in the 1960s and the microprocessor in the 1970s, digital broadcasting seems to have taken a footing in the global village that is broadcasting. However, most broadcasters are switching to digital broadcasting mostly because of a lack of frequency space.\n\n\nThus, because of these problems, most broadcasters are switching to digital techniques.\n\n"}
{"id": "2038838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038838", "title": "Pitch invasion", "text": "Pitch invasion\n\nA pitch invasion (known in North America as field invasion, field intrusion, rushing the field or storming the field) occurs when an individual or a crowd of people watching a sporting event run onto the playing area to celebrate or protest an incident. Pitch invasions may involve individual people or capacity crowds. Pitch invasions can result in charges being brought, possibly resulting in fines or jail time, and sanctions against the club(s) involved, especially if the actions cause a disruption in play.\n\nThis is especially common in college and high school football when a team pulls off a major upset, defeats a majoring rival, ends a long losing streak or notches a history-making win. Many schools employ riot police to physically prevent fans from rushing the field, a controversy in and of itself. However, with the widespread advent of artificial turf, some schools are becoming more lax about students invading the pitch. In the last few years, goal posts are also taken down within moments of the end of the game as a cautionary measure to prevent fans from climbing atop them to cause damage to the standard holding them up, damage to television camera equipment on the posts, and spectator injury. In the National Football League, storming the field usually results in lifetime revocation of season tickets from the holder of them, even if given or sold to another person.\n\nSection 10.5 of the Southeastern Conference By-Laws has a progressive fine policy adopted in 2004 for major sports: $5,000 for the first offence, $25,000 for the second offence, and $50,000 for third and subsequent offences within a three-year period of the last pitch invasion. In May 2015, the fines increased to $50,000, $100,000, and $250,000 for the first, second, and third plus subsequent offences, respectively, with period for past violations being increased from three years to five. \n\nThe Kentucky Wildcats have been hit with \"the triple\" for three football pitch invasions within eleven months:\n\nVanderbilt, South Carolina and Missouri had been fined $25,000 for second offence violations, but most SEC schools were fined $5,000. Missouri's fine is notable in that their second violation occurred after only three years as a member of the SEC: both came when supporters flooded Faurot Field after the team clinched a trip to the SEC Championship Game, in 2013 and 2014.\n\nLSU was fined $100,000 for a second offense following its victory 13 October 2018 vs. Georgia. \n\nAuburn became the first SEC institution to be fined the maximum of $250,000, following its football victory over Alabama on 25 November 2017. This came on top of violations following Auburn victories over Alabama in football in 2013 and Kentucky in men's basketball in 2016. Auburn was fined another $250,000 after fans stormed the field following its 2019 Iron Bowl victory.\n\nOther conferences have similar by-laws; in some conferences, the pitch invasion rule is reset to zero after five years without a pitch invasion, and the fine is doubled in the event that a player or official is injured as a result of the pitch invasion.\n\nHowever, more recently, some conferences have begun cracking down on pitch invasions in all sports.\n\nThere has long been a tradition in American football — primarily in college football — under which fans celebrating a major victory will tear down the goal posts on the field after the game. No one knows for certain when or how the tradition started. The Boston Public Library has in its collection a photograph of fans tearing down a goal post in 1940.\n\nTearing down the goal posts can be dangerous, however, as people can be injured or killed by a falling goal post. Persons who sit or hang on the goal posts while they are being pulled down can be injured if they fall off or if they land hard on the ground when the goal posts collapse. Camera equipment from a game broadcaster attached to the goalposts results in another injury possibility. These dangers can create legal implications for the schools, the localities, and the venues where the games occur.\n\nIn Massachusetts, there is a state statute that specifically prohibits the unauthorized tearing down of goal posts on a football field. Chapter 266, Section 104A of the Massachusetts General Laws provides: \"Whoever willfully and without right destroys, injures or removes a goal post on a football field shall be punished by a fine of not less than fifty nor more than two hundred dollars.\" The Massachusetts state legislature enacted the statute in 1960 in response to a tragedy that occurred the previous year. On 26 November 1959 (Thanksgiving Day that year), a 14-year-old girl in Foxborough, Jane Puffer, was hit on the head by a falling goal post. She had been part of a crowd that was on the field after the conclusion of a high school football game while a group of fans was tearing down a goal post. The steel goal post suddenly toppled to the ground, and Puffer was hit as she was apparently trying to push another girl out of its way. She died of her injuries the next day. The state legislature enacted the statute the following year, and the law has remained unchanged ever since.\n\nIn spite of the law, on 22 December 1985, fans of the New England Patriots tore down a goal post in Sullivan Stadium (also in Foxborough) to celebrate the team's victory there in the regular season finale against the Cincinnati Bengals, which clinched a playoff berth for the Patriots. Some fans carried the goal post outside of the stadium, where they caused it to come into contact with an overhead high-voltage power line. A man nearby, Jon Pallazola, was seriously injured. There was evidence that he was injured when he tried to protect himself from being hit by the falling goal post immediately after it became electrified. Pallazola subsequently sued a private security company that had been under contract to provide security at the stadium. He received a large jury verdict against the company, and then settled his claim against the company for $4.5 million. He also sued the Town of Foxborough but, in 1994, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that his claim against the town was barred by a state statute that gave municipalities immunity from claims that they failed to provide police protection or prevent crimes.\n\nOn 19 November 1983, an 18-year-old Harvard University student was critically injured when she was hit on the back of her head by a goal post that Harvard fans tore down to celebrate their team's victory over archrival Yale University at the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut. The student, Margaret Cimino, subsequently filed a lawsuit in federal court against Yale, the City of New Haven, the City of West Haven, and a security company. She settled her claims against the City of West Haven and the security company. In 1986, a federal judge ruled that Cimino had sufficient evidence to take her claims against Yale and the City of New Haven to trial. The parties then reached a settlement before the trial occurred.\n\nOn 21 November 1998, a first-year student at Oregon State University was seriously injured when she was hit on the head by a falling goal post that fans tore down after the football team's 44-41 double overtime victory over the University of Oregon. She suffered a fractured skull and bleeding in her brain, but she eventually recovered from her injuries.\n\nIn November 2000, fans of the University of Texas at El Paso tore down a goal post after a victory. One fan claimed that he was injured when fans pulled the goal posts down while he was hanging on them. He sued the university and the University System of Texas. A Texas intermediate appellate court ruled in 2005 that the lawsuit was barred by governmental immunity.\n\nOn 20 October 2001, a 21-year-old Ball State University student was rendered paraplegic when a goal post that fellow fans tore down to celebrate a victory landed on his back. The university had encouraged the fans to tear down the goal post, flashing a message on the scoreboard which said, \"The goal post looks lonely.\" The student, Andrew Bourne, settled his subsequent claim against the university for $300,000, the maximum amount that he could recover from the school under Indiana state law. He also filed a product liability lawsuit against the manufacturer of the goal post, contending that the goal post was \"defective and unreasonably dangerous\". In 2006, a federal appeals court ruled that the manufacturer was not liable because the danger posed by the goal post was \"obvious\".\n\nNow, in order to prevent injuries, there are collapsible goal posts that stadium staff can take down within seconds after the conclusion of a game to prevent fans from tearing them down. There are also goal posts that are constructed in such a manner that they cannot be taken down by fans.\n\nOn 2 November 2015, students at the University of Kansas illegally broke into Memorial Stadium and tore down the goalpost at the south end of the field following the Kansas City Royals' World Series clinching victory vs. the New York Mets at Citi Field. The goalposts at the stadium were also torn down after victories by the Jayhawks, vs. Nebraska in 2005, West Virginia in 2013, Iowa State in 2014 and Texas in 2016, and in 1994 by fans of archrival Kansas State.\n\nPitch invasions are not uncommon but not as frequent nowadays in top level football, but historically it was common for the supporters of the winning team in a major match, such as a Cup Final, to flood onto the pitch after the final whistle. For example, in Kenneth Wolstenholme's famous \"Some people are on the pitch, they think it's all over – it is now!\" comment on the BBC's television coverage of the 1966 World Cup Final. \"They\" were fans who had encroached onto the pitch before the end of extra time.\n\nPitch invasions became less common after the 1970s and 1980s. Counterintuitively, in that period that fans were barricaded in the stands by fences yet invasions were common; after the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, the barricading form of supposed crowd control was abandoned and pitch invasions became rarer. The decline may partly be due to the fact that in 1991 pitch invasions were criminalised in the UK under the Football Offences Act,and partly due to the post-Hillsborough requirement to convert terraces into all-seater stands from which it is somewhat more difficult for spectators to physically rush down in order to reach the pitch, especially in large numbers from higher rows of seats. However, they still occur, especially in the lower divisions where terraces are still permitted and where there is less policing and security.\n\nFamous pitch invasions include:\n\n\n\n\nPitch invasions have long been a tradition of Australian rules football. At the end of an Australian rules match, it is traditional for supporters to run onto the field to celebrate the game and play games of kick-to-kick with their families. \n\nSupporters were once also able to do this during the half-time break. In recent years, this was subject to stricter controls, and then finally banned altogether, in the elite Australian Football League. However, it is still common in suburban and state football leagues like the Victorian Football League.\n\nIt is also a tradition for football fans to engage in a \"mid-match\" pitch invasion when a player reaches a landmark achievement, typically a 100th goal in a season, a 1000th career goal, or in the case of Tony Lockett's 1300th career goal in 1999, breaking the all-time goal-kicking record. The AFL has not yet succeeded in preventing these mid-match invasions, but players are duly protected by bodyguards and stadium security while supporters flood onto the field.\n\nThere have been a few occasions of hostile pitch invasions; the most infamous of these occurred in the 1967 Tasmanian State Premiership Final, when hundreds of Wynyard fans invaded the field and tore down the goalposts to prevent North Hobart full forward David Collins from kicking a goal after the final siren. The Tasmanian Football League declared the match a \"no result\" and withheld the 1967 State Premiership.\n\nAnother hostile pitch invasion occurred in an AFL night game between St Kilda and Essendon in 1996, when the floodlights at Waverley Park lost power during the third quarter; fans rioted in the darkness and, coincidentally, also took down the goalposts. After an AFL meeting, the final quarter of the game was played three days later.\n\nSome unusual pitch invasions have become part of football folklore, such as the famous incident of the pig named \"Plugger\" being let loose on the ground in round 18, 1993. Similar incidents of animals invading the pitch have also occurred in recent years, including a feral cat which was arrested at AAMI Stadium, as well as occasional dogs. \n\nThe outlawed practice of \"streaking\" (running naked onto the ground) occurred in some big matches, most famously the performance of Helen d'Amico in the 1982 VFL Grand Final.\n\nIn modern baseball, intruding or storming the field is typically undertaken by one or a small number of attention seeking fans or pranksters, rather than a large number of people although more-generalized riots have occurred. Almost universally, the intruder(s) will be ejected from the ballpark and potentially banned for life from it, and may also face criminal charges depending on the nature of the offence.\n\nIn cases when a game is broadcast on television and a person or small group runs onto the field, the broadcaster will cut to another camera shot elsewhere in the stadium, to the commentators in the press box, or to a commercial break instead of focusing on the person(s); this is to avoid giving attention to their behavior, and to discourage imitators who might try the same thing (and as, occasionally, the person is also a streaker, to avoid showing nudity).\n\n\nMorganna, the Kissing Bandit became famous for rushing the field in baseball and other sports from the early 1970s through the 1980s. She rushed the field on numerous occasions and kissed many Major League Baseball players including Nolan Ryan, Pete Rose, Johnny Bench, George Brett (twice), Steve Garvey, and Cal Ripken Jr.\n\nCollege basketball has a similar phenomenon, known as \"storming the court\". This normally happens for the same reasons as storming the field in college football.\n\nIn high school and some colleges, walking on the court is the only way to exit from the stands. However, there are usually officials and security personnel that limit how far spectators can walk onto the court, at least while players and game officials are still leaving the court.\n\nThe Indiana University men's basketball team defeated the #1 ranked Kentucky Wildcats 73-72 on 10 December 2011, after a three-point shot by Christian Watford with no time left on the clock. Fans at Indiana's Assembly Hall filled the court within seconds to create a series of iconic images. ESPN commentator Dick Vitale, who was covering the game for the network, said it was the \"best game of the year\" and that \"[t]he atmosphere there was unreal, as I felt the building shaking after Watford hit the shot.\" Watford's shot won an ESPY Award for Best Play. Kentucky avenged their loss on their way to a National Championship later that season by defeating Indiana 102-90 during the Sweet Sixteen round of the 2012 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament.\n\nHundreds of students from Iowa State University stormed the court after the No. 4-ranked Cyclones' 83-82 come-from-behind victory over in-state rival Iowa 11 December 2015, at Hilton Coliseum in Ames, Iowa. In the aftermath, \"Des Moines Register\" sports columnist Randy Peterson suffered a leg fracture. The incident raised awareness of the dangers of court storming, but when asked about it in a post-game interview, Iowa State coach Steve Prohm stated, \"That's part of college athletics. That's a great moment. Those college kids ... they've been camping out here (for tickets) for three days. There's only probably 10 schools that do that in the country. Give them their 15 or 20 minutes to do that. I thought it was pretty cool.\" During A NBA Game In 2004 Pistons Ben Wallace Was Fouled By Metta Sandiford-Artest Fans Then Invaded The Court. Stephen Stephen Jackson And Jermaine O’Neal Punched A Fan. After That, The Game Was Called With The Indiana Pacers Were Awarded A 97-82 Win. Artest Was Suspended For 86 Games Jackson For 30 Games O’Neal For 15 Games Wallace For 6 Games And Anthony Johnson For 5 Games. Players Who Were On The Bench Were Suspended For 1 Game. David Harrison Was The Only Player Who Was Not Suspended. Artest Jackson O’Neal And Harrison Were Sentenced To 60 Hours Of Community Service While Johnson Was Sentenced To 100 Hours Of Community Service. In 2005 Reggie Miller Who Was Involved In The Brawl And Suspended For 1 Game Retired From Playing Basketball.\n\nAlthough not as well publicized as college incidents, fans storming the court after a big win is not uncommon at the high school level. The injuries suffered by several people following the Iowa State University men's basketball team's win over the University of Iowa in December 2015 prompted the Iowa Girls High School Athletic Union to issue a memorandum to athletic directors and coaches to remind fans that the organization and its sister organization, the Iowa High School Athletic Association, have policies prohibiting court storming after post-season games. \"I have to wonder if the person injured was the star player, the coach, or one of the game officials if the attitude and need for 'storming the court' might change?\" wrote IGHSAU executive director Mike Dick.\n\nIn March of 2016 Jerry Higgins of Cleveland St. Joseph High School made a buzzer-beating layup to defeat Beachwood in the District Championship. That basket set off this court invasion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEZi1LsE-9c\n\nIt used to be a common occurrence at the end of cricket Test matches for the crowd to invade the pitch to watch the presentation from the pavilion balcony. In the UK, this tradition ended in 2001 after a steward was injured in a pitch invasion at a one-day match between England and Pakistan. Invading the pitch can now warrant a £1,000 fine and a lifetime ban from the ground. Post-match presentations are now held on the field or in a room within the venue restricted from public access and displayed on a video scoreboard if available.\n\nIn August 1975, vandals protesting the imprisonment of alleged armed robber George Davis invaded the pitch of the Headingley Cricket Ground before the final day of the Third Ashes Test between England and Australia, digging holes in the field and covering one end of the pitch in oil. This led to the first-ever declaration of a Test ground being unfit for play, resulting in the match being abandoned and declared a draw. This was significant as it denied England a chance to tie the series and potentially retain the Ashes; Australia eventually took back the Ashes.\n\nIn 1982, a pitch invasion at the WACA led to Australian bowler Terry Alderman suffering a shoulder injury when attempting to apprehend one of the intruders.\n\nTwo One Day International matches at the Bourda ground in Georgetown, Guyana have had their results disrupted by pitch invasions. In 1993, the crowd invaded on the last ball of a match as the West Indies ran a second run to tie the score against Pakistan; then, in 1999, the crowd invaded on the last ball of a match as Australia ran a third run to tie the score against the West Indies. In both cases, the fielding team had been a chance of effecting a run-out to prevent the tying run, had the crowd not invaded; but in both cases, match referee Raman Subba Row declared the match to be tied.\n\nIn Gaelic football and hurling, both national sports of Ireland, pitch invasions were acceptable and most widely seen at Provincial and All-Ireland Finals. However, there has only been one occurrence at Croke Park, after the 2010 Leinster Senior Football Championship Final, due to a crackdown since 2009 by the GAA, though they still occur in other stadia around the country.\n\nInternational rules football, a hybrid of Aussie Rules and Gaelic football is not known for pitch invasions; however, a famous one occurred in the first test of the 2006 International Rules Series at Pearse Stadium, Galway after Ireland defeated Australia.\n\nThe game included several impersonators and streakers, but at the end of the game, when Ireland had come from behind to win with goals in the dying seconds of the match, the crowd rushed the field, causing much controversy with the Australian players.\n\nIn New South Wales Rugby League matches up until the 1980s, spectators often took to the field on the completion of the match within seconds after the final siren. This required the players to navigate through a crowd of people when coming off the field, and the cardboard corner posts were usually taken as \"souvenirs\".\n\nThis practice was discouraged when the publicly viewable game clock stopped with five minutes to play in order to ensure that spectators, not knowing when the game was about to finish, could not jump the gun and enter the playing arena with the game unfinished. Eventually the tradition died out, and spectators rarely, if ever, take the field in the present day National Rugby League; fines of $7000 and lifetime bans exist for those who do so.\n\nIn 2007, a match between Hull Kingston Rovers and Hull FC at Craven Park also known as the 'Hull Derby', the match ended at a score off 30 – 20 in favour of Hull FC. After the final whistle Hull FC fans raided the pitch to congratulate their players. The same happened in 2015 after Hull beat Rovers 22-12 which secured them a play-off spot\n\nPitch invasions have occurred throughout the history of rugby union, with some particular moments being the most infamous. In the past, additional security support has been constructed at stadiums due to foreseen trouble. An early example of this was at the 1924 Summer Olympics, when a wire fence was constructed to protect United States players.\n\n\nMost arena sports (like ice hockey, arena football, and indoor soccer) take precautions to separate the spectators from the players and to ensure one cannot cross into the other. This is not only for the protection of the players but also the spectators as it also helps prevent pucks, balls, and other objects from flying at speed into spectators and causing injury. Often, in addition to sidewalls, Plexiglas panels are used as a safety measure. Ice hockey uses the panels around the ice, team benches, and penalty boxes to enforce separation under the rules, and after the death of a young spectator in Columbus, Ohio in 2002, tall netting above the Plexiglas to protect spectators in each shooting end from flying hockey pucks. Furthermore, the iced surface means stepping onto a hockey rink without skates is dangerous. A few attempts to intrude in arena games have usually ended with physical player intervention.\n\n"}

They started with steamers at an Exhibition in 1867. Many seat several hundred people, often with an open upper deck and an enclosed lower deck; some have sliding canopies that can close to protect the open deck in inclement weather. Most boat tours include a live or recorded commentary on the sights along the river. A typical cruise lasts about one hour. Many companies offer lunch and dinner cruises as well. Most boats are equipped with lights to illuminate landmarks in the evening. The Steamers stopped running in the slow down of the Great Depression.\n\nSince the Seine is centrally situated in Paris, a boat tour covers a great deal of the city. Both the Left Bank (\"Rive Gauche\") and the Right Bank (\"Rive Droite\") are visible from the boat. Passengers can see, among other sites, the Eiffel Tower; Notre-Dame Cathedral; the Alexander III Bridge, the Pont Neuf; the Orsay Museum, and the Louvre Museum. Passengers can also see Les Invalides, Napoleon's burial site.\n\nBoat tours in Paris have flourished since World War II, and today the Compagnie des Bateaux Mouches (still the oldest company operating boat tours) has significant competition. On busy days in high season, boats constantly move up and down the river.\n\nA Canadian company runs a tour of the Saint Lawrence River around Montreal with a similar boat called the \"Bateau-Mouche of the Old Port of Montréal\".\n\nKingston 1000 Island Cruises, in Kingston, Ontario, Canada operates \"Le Bateau Mouche II\" for lunch and dinner cruises of the 1000 Islands. The vessel is referred to unofficially for marketing purposes as the \"Island Star\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2038854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038854", "title": "Exhale (Shoop Shoop)", "text": "Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\n\n\"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\" is a song by American recording artist Whitney Houston, featured on for the film \"Waiting to Exhale\". It was released as the lead single from the soundtrack on November 7, 1995, by Arista Records. The song was written and produced by Babyface. A mid-tempo R&B ballad, composed in the key of C major, the song's lyrics speak about growing up and learning to let go. The song garnered mostly positive reviews from critics, many of whom noted Houston's vocal maturity in the song.\n\nIn the United States, it became the third single to debut on top of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart in \"Billboard\"s history, and Houston's eleventh (and final) number one single. It was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of one million copies. The song also reached number one in Canada and Spain, and the top 10 in Finland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Sweden. Additionally, it peaked within the top 20 in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. At the 39th Annual Grammy Awards, held on February 26, 1997, \"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\" received four nominations, including the Grammy Award for Song of the Year, and won in the category of Best R&B Song. The song also won four other awards, including a Soul Train Music Award.\n\nThe music video for the song, directed by Forest Whitaker, shows close-up scenes of Houston inter-cut with scenes from the film \"Waiting to Exhale\". Houston performed the song at the 39th Grammy Awards ceremony, and on the HBO special \"Classic Whitney Live from Washington, D.C.\" in October 1997. It was included in the set-list of Houston's three tours and select dates of various concerts.\n\nIn 1994, Houston signed with 20th Century Fox to play the role of Savannah Jackson in the film \"Waiting to Exhale\", which was adapted from the novel of the same name by Terry McMillan. Initially, she had no interest in recording songs for the film's soundtrack, as she wanted to concentrate on her acting. The film's director, Forest Whitaker, hired Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds to compose the film score and the accompanying soundtrack. Though Babyface visited the set of the film and tried to convince her, Houston was determined not to record songs for the soundtrack. She finally agreed after hearing Babyface play one of the songs she liked. In an interview with Fred Bronson, Babyface explained the development of the song:\n\n\"When Whitney first heard the song, she figured I'd lost it—I couldn't come up with words anymore. And, actually she's right. I couldn't think of anything for that particular part. It felt like it should groove there. But I knew it couldn't groove without any vocals, so I started humming along with it and that's what happened. The 'shoops' came. But they felt so good, I thought 'Why not?' It doesn't have to mean anything.\"\nBabyface produced the song, and it was released as the lead single from \"Waiting to Exhale\" soundtrack on November 7, 1995, through Arista Records. The b-side of the single includes four songs: \"Dancin' on the Smooth Edge\", which was initially included as the B-side to \"All the Man That I Need\" (1991), \"Moment of Truth\", \"Do You Hear What I Hear\", which Houston recorded for the compilation \"A Very Special Christmas\" (1987), and her duet with Aretha Franklin, \"It Isn't, It Wasn't, It Ain't Never Gonna Be\" (1989). \"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\" is also featured on Houston's compilation albums \"\" (2000), \"Love, Whitney\" (2001), \"The Ultimate Collection\" (2007), \"The Essential Whitney Houston\" (2011), and \"\" (2012).\n\n\"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\" is an R&B ballad written in the key of C-sharp major. The song is set in common time with a tempo of 69 beats per minute. It has the sequence of F–C/E–Dm–C as its chord progression throughout the track, and Houston's vocals span an octave and a perfect fifth, from G to D. The song's instrumentation includes quiet bells and strings, and the whole arrangement is mellow. According to Steve Knopper of \"Newsday\", the bells resemble electronic Christmas bells, and Houston ad-libs \"shoo-pay\" over the chorus. The chorus repeats the phrase \"shoop de shoop\".\n\nAccording to Bronson, the song summarizes the movie's philosophy. His opinion was somewhat echoed by Ted Cox, author of the book \"Whitney Houston\", who noted that the soothing quality of the song fitted perfectly with the mood and texture of the movie. He described that the song has a \"slow groove\" that features the most relaxed singing of Houston's career. \"The Miami Herald\" described the song as a model of \"refined, easy-going soul\", and Kyle Anderson of MTV described it as a \"smooth jam\" with a \"crazy-catchy groove\". Describing the instrumentation as \"silky\", Larry Flick of \"Billboard\" wrote that Houston's performance was more soulful than before, with far more \"vocal colors\". Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" commented that the song is reminiscent of 1960s girl group records, and the verses speak about growing up and learning to let go.\n\n\"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\" received mostly positive reviews from music critics; most of which were positive about Houston's 'soulful' performance and vocal maturity. Jean Rosenbluth of \"Los Angeles Times\" praised the song, saying \"Houston's elegant 'Exhale (Shoop Shoop)' [...] exude[s] maturity without resorting to the relentlessly big vocals that characterize so many R&B records aiming for adult audiences.\" Geoffrey Himes of \"The Washington Post\" wrote, \"Sounding like someone who has just emptied her lungs after holding her breath a long time, Houston brings a surprisingly mature, world-weary tone to the song.\" Robert Hilburn, pop music critic of \"Los Angeles Times\", noted Babyface's achievement in the song, saying \"he [Babyface] brings Houston down to earth, trading her normal vocal exuberance for convincing warmth.\" Larry Flick of \"Billboard\" called the song \"a surprisingly understated shuffle-ballad with soul and far more interesting vocal colors than all the shrieking can provide.\" Mike Wood from \"Idolator\" described it as a \"slow-jamming gem\", noting \"the soothing lyrics about learning how to let go and move on: “Sometimes you laugh, sometimes you cry / Life never tells us the whens or whys.” If only we all could keep that calm in light of life's calamities.\" \"Rome News-Tribune\" wrote that \"Exhale' has an easygoing, infectious charm\", and that Houston \"delivers a soulfully relaxed vocal.\" Anthony Violenti of \"The Buffalo News\" gave the song a positive review, commenting that Houston's vocals were intoxicating. \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\", in their review of the soundtrack, viewed the song as \"easy and understated\". Steve Knopper of \"Newsday\" wrote that the song was \"irresistibly catchy\" and irritating at the same time. However, Patricia Smith of \"The Boston Globe\" wrote that the \"Shoop Shoop\"s were \"annoying\". While reviewing Houston's compilation \"Whitney: The Greatest Hits\" (2000), Christine Galera of \"Orlando Sentinel\" also expressed her dislike for the song, stating the songs from \"Waiting to Exhale\", including \"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\" and \"Why Does It Hurt So Bad\", were too mellow.\n\n\"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\" was voted number twenty-three on \"The Village Voice\"s 1996 Pazz & Jop critics' poll, tied with five other songs, Eels' \"Novocaine for the Soul\", Everything but the Girl's \"Missing\", Garbage's \"Only Happy When It Rains\", Rage Against the Machine's \"Bulls on Parade\", and Underworld's \"Born Slippy\".\n\n\"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\" won Best R&B/Soul Single, Female award and was nominated for Best R&B/Soul or Rap Song of the Year at the 10th Annual Soul Train Music Awards on March 29, 1996. Houston won two National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Image Awards for Outstanding Song and Outstanding Female Artist at the 27th annual ceremony, broadcast live on April 23, 1996. The song was nominated for Best Song from a Movie at the 5th MTV Movie Awards on June 8, and for Best R&B/Soul Single – Solo at the Second Annual Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards on September 9, 1996. The song received four Grammy nominations―Song of the Year (Babyface), Best R&B Song (Babyface), Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media (Babyface), and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance (Houston), and won in the category of Best R&B Song, at the 39th Grammy Awards, held on February 26, 1997. Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds won a Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) Pop Music Award for the song at the 45th annual ceremony, held on May 13, 1997.\n\nIn the United States, \"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\" debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and the Hot R&B Singles chart, the issue dated November 25, 1995, with 125,000 copies sold in its first week. It became the third number-one single to do so in \"Billboard\"s history, following Michael Jackson's \"You Are Not Alone\" (1995) and Mariah Carey's \"Fantasy\" (1995). In addition, it became Houston's 11th and seventh number one single on the Hot 100 and the Hot R&B Singles charts respectively, and was Houston's last number one hit on the Hot 100 chart. The single stayed at the top of the Hot 100 for just one week, and was replaced by \"One Sweet Day\" by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men. It descended to the number two position and spent 11 consecutive weeks there, from December 2, 1995, to February 10, 1996, setting the record for the longest stay in the runner-up position. However, it had as few as 21 weeks in the Top 50. On the Hot R&B Singles chart, the single remained at the summit for eight consecutive weeks from its debut week, making it Houston's second-longest stay on the top position since \"I Will Always Love You\" (1992), which remained atop the chart for 11 weeks. The song peaked at number five on the \"Billboard\" Adult Contemporary chart, spending a total of 26 weeks on the chart. The song placed at number 14 and number 18 on the 1996 \"Billboard\" year-end Hot 100 and Hot R&B Singles charts respectively. It has sold over 1,500,000 copies in the US and was certified platinum for shipments exceeding 1,000,000 copies by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on January 3, 1996. In Canada, the single entered the \"RPM\" 100 Hit Tracks chart at number 90, on November 13, 1995. Eight weeks later it topped the chart and spent two weeks at the top spot, becoming Houston's eighth number-one single in Canada. The song was ranked at number 20 on the \"RPM\" Year-end Top 100 Hit Tracks chart for 1996.\n\nIn other countries, the single performed moderately on the chart. In the United Kingdom, it debuted at number 11 on the UK Singles Chart for the week dated November 18, 1995. The next week it dropped to number sixteen before descending the charts steadily. According to MTV, the single has sold about 100,000 copies in the UK. In the Netherlands, \"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\" peaked at number seven and stayed on the chart for a total of 11 weeks. It made number 79 on the Dutch Singles year-end charts. In Australia, the song entered the ARIA Charts at number 30, the week dated December 10, 1995. The following week, it ascended to its peak position of number 18, before descending the charts. In Switzerland, \"Exhale\" debuted at number 16, the week dated December 10, 1995. Three weeks later, it peaked at number 13. The song fell to number 16 the next week, and exited the chart at number 49, the week dated March 24, 1996. The song also reached number six in Finland and number four in New Zealand, and number 10 in Sweden. It peaked within the top 20 of the singles charts in a few other countries: number 15 in Austria, 16 in Belgium (Wallonia) and Ireland, 14 in Norway, and 13 in Switzerland. However, in few other countries, the song managed to reach only the top 40; it peaked at number 22 in Belgium (Flanders), 23 in France, and 26 in Germany.\n\nThe music video for \"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\" was directed by Forest Whitaker, who also directed \"Waiting to Exhale\". The video focuses mainly on close-ups of Houston, sporting a short and mature coif, as she sings. Scenes of the movie are inter-cut between her scenes. In a \"Making of the Video\" segment of \"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\", which aired on Japanese satellite television channel NHK-BS2, Houston explained:\n\n\"I wanted him [Whitaker] to do it. And he said 'yeah'. I said 'are you sure you can? Because you've got so much to do.' He said 'I think I can do this.' I kinda got afraid because I knew he was working so hard.\"\nAccording to Houston, the song was direct, so she wanted the video to be direct and concentrate on her face and on the lyrics. Whitaker also expressed a same opinion of the song. He said, \"I've seen the video [...] It's like a thing she has, you know, that I guess people would say is like a charisma kinda thing that it zooms, you know, comes up. It's beautiful [...] It's magic, it's spirit.\" The video aired on MTV on October 10, 1995. According to Marla Shelton, a writer for \"Camera Obscura\", a journal of feminism and film theory, \"the video concept's originality stops with Houston's hair style as its stark simplicity underscores the 'straight and narrow' politics of the film.\" When the film was released, the video was shown as a trailer prior to the beginning of films on 450 General Cinema screens in some major US media markets.\n\nHouston performed \"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\" live a number of times, between 1996 and 2009. In February 1997, Houston performed it as the third song of her 'Waiting to Exhale Medley'―\"Sittin' Up in My Room\" by Brandy, \"Not Gon' Cry\" by Mary J. Blige, \"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\" by Houston, and \"Count On Me\" by Houston, CeCe Winans, Brandy, Blige, Chaka Khan, and Aretha Franklin―at the 39th Grammy Awards. Houston sang the song live on the HBO special \"Classic Whitney Live from Washington, D.C.\" on both October 3 and 5, 1997. Houston's solo performance was followed by ad-libs of its chorus. She was joined by BeBe Winans, Monica, and Shirley Caesar, who was seated in the audience and invited onstage by Houston. Houston used the song throughout the entire run of her The Pacific Rim Tour (1997). She performed it again during the entire run of her My Love Is Your Love World Tour (1999), as a part of the promotion for her fourth studio album, \"My Love Is Your Love\" (1998). In April 2000, Houston performed the song on the 25th Anniversary Celebration of Arista Records. She was backed by a seven-piece band, a 14-piece string section and four background singers. Houston started by saying \"We all need to exhale sometimes\", and proceeded to sing the song. The song was included in the set list of her Nothing but Love World Tour (2010) promoting her seventh studio album, \"I Look to You\" (2009).\n\nBabyface performed the song with Beverly Crowder on \"MTV Unplugged\" on October 18, 1997. The performance was released on CD in November 1997, and on DVD and VHS in August 2001, titled \"Babyface MTV Unplugged NYC 1997\". In April 2012, possibly as a tribute to Houston following her death, R&B singer Robin Thicke covered the song and released his rendition as a single.\n\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from \"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\" single liner notes.\n\"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\"\n\n\"Dancin' on the Smooth Edge\"\n\n\"Moment of Truth\"\n\"Do You Hear What I Hear\"\n\n\"It Isn't, It Wasn't, It Ain't Never Gonna Be\"\n\n\n"}

Ray\n\nDavid Robert \"Bobby\" Ray (February 14, 1945 – March 19, 1969) was a United States Navy hospital corpsman second class who was killed in action during the Vietnam War while assigned to an artillery battery of the United States Marine Corps. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions above and beyond the call of duty on March 19, 1969.\n\nRay was born on February 14, 1945 to David F. and Donnie M. Ray of McMinnville, Tennessee. He graduated from City High School in McMinnville in 1963. He was a University of Tennessee Alumni Scholarship winner and attended classes at the Knoxville campus from 1963 to 1966. He also received an associate in arts degree in 1965 from Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee. A memorial to Ray was placed on the Cumberland campus in 2003 in honor of his service and sacrifice.\n\nRay enlisted in the U.S. Navy in Nashville, Tennessee on March 28, 1966 and reported to Recruit Training Command, Naval Training Center, San Diego, California. Afterwards, he attended the former Naval Hospital Corps School in San Diego and became a hospital corpsman and promoted to hospitalman on June 20. His first assignment as a corpsman was aboard the where he was promoted to hospital corpsman third class on April 16, 1967. In December, following his tour on the hospital ship, he was assigned to the former U.S. Naval Hospital in Long Beach, California, where he was promoted to hospital corpsman second class.\n\nIn May 1968, Ray requested a tour of duty with the Fleet Marine Force and was sent to Field Medical Service School, Camp Pendleton, California, to become a FMF corpsman upon successful completion of the course. On July 12, he was sent to and arrived in South Vietnam, and was assigned to Battery D, 2nd Battalion, 11th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division (Reinforced), located at An Hoa, South Vietnam.\n\nIn the early morning of March 19, 1969, Fire Support Base Phu Loc 6, located on a hill adjacent to Liberty Bridge near An Hoa in Quảng Nam province and the command post of the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines located near them, were both attacked by an estimated battalion of North Vietnamese soldiers. Ray, the senior corpsman for Battery D, moved from parapet to parapet during the enemy's attack on and at their position rendering medical aid to the wounded Marines. While doing this he was seriously wounded and then had to confront two enemy soldiers attacking his position, killing one and wounding another. After he refused to be aided by the other Battery D corpsman, he continued his lifesaving efforts under oncoming enemy fire.\n\nRay's final act of heroism was aiding and protecting a wounded Marine after he had run out of ammunition. He placed himself upon the Marine after he saw an enemy thrown grenade land near them. Ray died after the grenade blast, while the Marine he sacrificed his life for, lived. Ray and eleven Marines from Battery D and two Marines and one Navy corpsman from the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines command post, were killed in the attack.\n\nRay was unmarried. His body was returned to the United States and was buried with full military honors in Mountain View Cemetery McMinnville, Tennessee.\n\nRay was posthumously presented the Medal of Honor in a White House ceremony on April 20, 1970, with his father accepting the medal on his son's behalf from Vice President Spiro T. Agnew.\n\nRay's military decorations and awards include:\n\nRank and organization: Hospital Corpsman Second Class, U.S. Navy, 2d Battalion, 11th Marines, 1st Marine Division (Reinforced), III Marine Amphibious Force. Place and date: Quang Nam Province, Republic of Vietnam, March 19, 1969. Entered service at: Nashville, Tenn. Born: February 14, 1945, McMinnville, Tenn.\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a HM2 with Battery D, 2d Battalion, at Phu Loc 6, near An Hoa. During the early morning hours, an estimated battalion-sized enemy force launched a determined assault against the battery's position, and succeeded in effecting a penetration of the barbed-wire perimeter. The initial burst of enemy fire caused numerous casualties among the Marines who had immediately manned their howitzers during the rocket and mortar attack. Undaunted by the intense hostile fire, HM2 Ray moved from parapet to parapet, rendering emergency medical treatment to the wounded. Although seriously wounded himself while administering first aid to a Marine casualty, he refused medical aid and continued his lifesaving efforts. While he was bandaging and attempting to comfort another wounded Marine, HM2 Ray was forced to battle two enemy soldiers who attacked his position, personally killing one and wounding the other. Rapidly losing his strength as a result of his severe wounds, he nonetheless managed to move through the hail of enemy fire to other casualties. Once again, he was faced with the intense fire of oncoming enemy troops and, despite the grave personal danger and insurmountable odds, succeeded in treating the wounded and holding off the enemy until he ran out of ammunition, at which time he sustained fatal wounds. HM2 Ray's final act of heroism was to protect the patient he was treating. He threw himself upon the wounded Marine, thus saving the man's life when an enemy grenade exploded nearby. By his determined and persevering actions, courageous spirit, and selfless devotion to the welfare of his Marine comrades, HM2 Ray served to inspire the men of Battery D to heroic efforts in defeating the enemy. His conduct throughout was in keeping with the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.\n\n\nRay's name appears on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall at panel 29W, row 082 in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n"}

It was founded by Andrew Carnegie in 1905 and chartered in 1906 by an act of the United States Congress. Among its most notable accomplishments are the development of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association (TIAA), the Flexner Report on medical education, the Carnegie Unit, the Educational Testing Service, and the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education.\n\nThe foundation was founded by Andrew Carnegie in 1905 and chartered in 1906 by an act of the United States Congress under the leadership of its first president, Henry Pritchett. The foundation credits Pritchett with broadening their mission to include work in education policy and standards. John W. Gardner became president in 1955 while also serving as president of the Carnegie Corporation of New York. He was followed by Alan Pifer whose most notable accomplishment was the 1967 establishment of a task force with Clark Kerr at its helm.\n\nThe foundation started the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE), initially as an experiment in 1936. It was acquired by the Educational Testing Service in 1948.\n\nIn 1979, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching separated from the Carnegie Corporation and came into its own with Ernest L. Boyer as president. Under his leadership, the foundation moved to Princeton, New Jersey, where it remained until 1997 when then-president Lee Shulman relocated it to Stanford, California.\n\n\nThe Carnegie Foundation for Advancement of Teaching promotes the use of improvement science as an approach to research that supports system reform. Improvement Science is a set of approaches designed to facilitate innovation and implementation of new organizational practices. Research scholar Catherine Langley's framework builds-off of W. Edwards Deming's plan-do-study-act cycle and couples it with three foundational questions:\nApproaches may vary in design and structure, but are always rooted in research-practitioner partnerships. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching outlines six principles for improvement on their website. \nCarnegie researcher Paul LeMahieu and his colleagues have summarized these six principles as \"three interdependent, overlapping, and highly recursive aspects of improvement work: problem definition, analysis and specification; iterative prototyping and testing...; and organizing as networks to...spread learning\". Professional learning communities (PLCs) are increasing in popularity in education to promote problem solving and often align with many of these design principles. Researcher Anthony Bryk sees PLCs as a place to begin applying these principles, but also notes that PLC success is often isolated by teams or within schools and remains heavily dependent on the individual educators involved. A mechanism is needed to accumulate, detail, test, redesign knowledge in partnerships like PLCs so that it can be transformed and transferred as collective professional knowledge across diverse and complex settings.\n\nNetworked Improvement Communities are another form of Improvement Science. Douglas Engelbart originally coined the term \"Network Improvement Community\" in relation to his work in the software and engineering field as network of human and technical resources to enable the community to get better at getting better. Anthony Bryk and his team have defined Networked Improvement Communities as social arrangements that involve individuals from many different contexts working together with a common interest in achieving common goals to surface and test new ideas across varied contexts to enhance design at scale. Douglas Engelbart sees three levels of human and technical resources that need to work together: on the ground practitioners, organizational level structures and resources to support the data collection and analysis of practitioners, and inter-institutional resources to share, adapt, and expand on information learned across varied contexts. In education, these communities are problem-centered and link academic research, clinical practice, and local expertise to focus on implementation and adaptation for context.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2038911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038911", "title": "Henry reaction", "text": "Henry reaction\n\nThe Henry reaction is a classic carbon–carbon bond formation reaction in organic chemistry. Discovered in 1895 by the Belgian chemist Louis Henry (1834–1913), it is the combination of a nitroalkane and an aldehyde or ketone in the presence of a base to form β-nitro alcohols. This type of reaction is also referred to as a nitroaldol reaction (nitroalkane, aldehyde, and alcohol). It is nearly analogous to the aldol reaction that had been discovered 23 years prior that couples two carbonyl compounds to form β-hydroxy carbonyl compounds known as \"aldols\" (aldehyde and alcohol). The Henry reaction is a useful technique in the area of organic chemistry due to the synthetic utility of its corresponding products, as they can be easily converted to other useful synthetic intermediates. These conversions include subsequent dehydration to yield nitroalkenes, oxidation of the secondary alcohol to yield α-nitro ketones, or reduction of the nitro group to yield β-amino alcohols.\n\nMany of these uses have been exemplified in the syntheses of various pharmaceuticals including the β-blocker (\"S\")-propranolol, the HIV protease inhibitor Amprenavir (Vertex 478), and construction of the carbohydrate subunit of the anthracycline class of antibiotics, L-Acosamine. The synthetic scheme of the L-Acosamine synthesis can be found in the Examples section of this article.\n\nThe Henry reaction begins with the deprotonation of the nitroalkane on the α-carbon position forming a nitronate. The pKa of most nitroalkanes is approximately 17. Although this structure is nucleophilic both at the deprotonated carbon and at the oxy-anions of the nitro group, the observed result is of the carbon attacking the carbonyl compound. The resulting β-nitro alkoxide is protonated by the conjugate acid of the base that originally deprotonated the nitroalkyl structure, giving the respective β-nitro alcohol as product.\n\nIt is important to note that all steps of the Henry reaction are reversible. This is due to the lack of a committed step in the reaction to form product. It is for this reason that research has been geared towards modifications to drive the reaction to completion. More information about this can be found in the modification section of this article.\n\nOne of the commonly accepted models for stereoselection without any modification to the Henry reaction is shown below where stereoselectivity is governed by the size of the R groups in the model (ex. carbon chain) as well as a transition state that minimizes dipole by orienting the nitro group and carbonyl oxygen anti (on opposite sides) each other. The R groups play a role in the transition state of the Henry reaction in that the larger the R groups are on each of the substrates, the more they will want to orient themselves away from each other (commonly referred to as steric effects) \n\nDue to a number of factors, including the reversibility of the reaction, as well as the tendency for easy epimerization of the nitro-substituted carbon atom, the Henry reaction will typically produce a mixture of enantiomers or diastereomers. It is for this reason that explanations for stereoselectivity remain scarce without some modification. In recent years, research focus has shifted toward modifications of the Henry reaction to overcome this synthetic challenge.\n\nThe first example of an enatioselective nitroaldol reaction was reported in 1992 using Shibasaki catalysts. One of the most frequently employed ways to induce enantio- or diastereoselectivity in the Henry reaction has been through the use of chiral metal catalysts in which the nitro group and carbonyl oxygen coordinate to a metal that is bound to a chiral organic molecule. Some examples of metals that have been used include Zn, Co, Cu, Mg, and Cr. A depiction of this coordination is illustrated above.\n\nOne of the many features of the Henry reaction that makes it synthetically attractive is that it utilizes only a catalytic amount of base to drive the reaction. Additionally a variety of bases can be used including ionic bases such as alkali metal hydroxides, alkoxides, carbonates, and sources of fluoride anion (e.g. TBAF) or nonionic organic amine bases including TMG, DBU, DBN, and PAP. It is important to note that the base and solvent used do not have a large influence on the overall outcome of the reaction.\n\nOne of the main drawbacks of the Henry reaction is the potential for side reactions throughout the course of the reaction. Aside from the reversibility of the reaction (retro–Henry) which could prevent the reaction from proceeding, the β-nitro alcohol has the potential to undergo dehydration, and for sterically hindered substrates it is possible that a base catalyzed self-condensation (Cannizaro reaction) could occur. A general scheme of the Cannizzaro reaction is depicted below.\n\nThere have been a series of modifications made to the Henry reaction. Of these some of the most important include employing high-pressure and sometimes solvent free conditions to improve chemo- and regioselectivity and chiral metal catalysts to induce enantio-or diastereoselectivity. \nThe aza-Henry reaction is also used to produce nitroamines and can be a reliable synthetic route for the synthesis of vicinal diamines.\n\nPerhaps one of the most synthetically useful modifications to the Henry reaction is the use of an organocatalyst. The catalytic cycle is shown below.\n\nList described that while this is a broad explanation, his brief review illustrates that this is a plausible mechanistic explanation for almost all reactions that involve an organocatalyst. An example of this type of reaction is illustrated in the Examples section of this article.\n\nIn addition to the previously mentioned modifications to the Henry reaction there are a variety of others. This includes the conversion of unreactive alkyl nitro compounds to their corresponding dianions which will react faster with carbonyl substrates, reactions can be accelerated using PAP as base, utilization of the reactivity of aldehydes with α,α-doubly deprotonated nitroalkanes to give nitronate alkoxides that yield mainly syn-nitro alcohols once protonated, and finally generation of nitronate anions in which one oxygenatom on the nitro group is silyl-protected to yield anti-β-nitro alcohols in the presence of a fluoride anion source when reacted with an aldehyde.\n\nIndustrial Application- In 1999, Menzel and coworkers developed a synthetic route to obtaining -acosamine, the carbohydrate subunit of the anthracycline class of antibiotics:\n\nIndustrial Application- An enantioselective aldol addition product can be obtained in asymmetric synthesis by reaction of benzaldehyde with nitromethane and the a catalyst system consisting of zinc triflate as a Lewis acid, diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), and \"N\"-methylephedrine (NME) as and as a chiral ligand.\n\nA diastereoselective variation of this reaction is depicted below.\n\nTotal Synthesis- In 2005, Barua and coworkers completed the total synthesis of the potent aminopeptidase inhibitor, (–)-bestatin, in an overall yield of 26% overall yield employing Shibasaki's asymmetric Henry reaction as the key step. (illustrated below)\n\nOrganocatalysis- In 2006, Hiemstra and coworkers explored the use of quinine derivatives as asymmetric catalysts for the reaction between aromatic aldehydes and nitromethane. Through the use of particular derivatives, they were able to induce direct enantioselection through the use of the proper catalyst.\n\nBiocatalysis - In 2006, Purkarthofer et al. found that (\"S\")-hydroxynitrile lyase from \"Hevea brasiliensis\" catalyzes the formation of (\"S\")-β-nitro alcohols. In 2011, Fuhshuku and Asano showed that the (\"R\")-selective hydroxynitrile lyase from \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" could catalyze the synthesis of (\"R\")-β-nitro alcohols from nitromethane and aromatic aldehydes.\n"}

These four articles contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space, time, mass, and energy. The \"annus mirabilis\" is often called the \"miracle year\" in English or \"Wunderjahr\" in German.\n\nThe first paper elucidated the theory of the photoelectric effect; the second paper explained Brownian motion; the third paper introduced special relativity; and the fourth, mass-energy equivalence. Together, these papers substantially advanced the field of modern physics.\n\nAt the time the papers were written, Einstein did not have easy access to a complete set of scientific reference materials, although he did regularly read and contribute reviews to \"Annalen der Physik\". Additionally, scientific colleagues available to discuss his theories were few. He worked as an examiner at the Patent Office in Bern, Switzerland, and he later said of a co-worker there, Michele Besso, that he \"could not have found a better sounding board for his ideas in all of Europe\". In addition, co-workers and the other members of the self-styled \"Olympian Academy\" (Maurice Solovine and Paul Habicht) and his wife, Mileva Marić, had some influence on Einstein's work, but how much is unclear.\nThrough these papers, Einstein tackled some of the era's most important physics questions and problems. In 1900, Lord Kelvin, in a lecture titled \"Nineteenth-Century Clouds over the Dynamical Theory of Heat and Light\", suggested that physics had no satisfactory explanations for the results of the Michelson–Morley experiment and for black body radiation. As introduced, special relativity provided an account for the results of the Michelson–Morley experiments. Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect extended the quantum theory which Max Planck had developed in his successful explanation of black-body radiation.\n\nDespite the greater fame achieved by his other works, such as that on special relativity, it was his work on the photoelectric effect that won him his Nobel Prize in 1921. The Nobel committee had waited patiently for experimental confirmation of special relativity; however, none was forthcoming until the time dilation experiments of Ives and Stilwell (1938), (1941) and Rossi and Hall (1941).\n\nThe article \"On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light\" received March 18 and published June 9, proposed the idea of \"energy quanta\". This idea, motivated by Max Planck's earlier derivation of the law of black-body radiation, assumes that luminous energy can be absorbed or emitted only in discrete amounts, called \"quanta\". Einstein states,\n\nIn explaining the photoelectric effect, the hypothesis that energy consists of \"discrete packets\", as Einstein illustrates, can be directly applied to black bodies, as well.\n\nThe idea of light quanta contradicts the wave theory of light that follows naturally from James Clerk Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic behavior and, more generally, the assumption of infinite divisibility of energy in physical systems.\n\nEinstein noted that the photoelectric effect depended on the wavelength, and hence the frequency of the light. At too low a frequency, even intense light produced no electrons. However, once a certain frequency was reached, even low intensity light produced electrons. He compared this to Planck's hypothesis that light could be emitted only in packets of energy given by \"hf\", where \"h\" is Planck's constant and \"f\" is the frequency. He then postulated that light travels in packets whose energy depends on the frequency, and therefore only light above a certain frequency would bring sufficient energy to liberate an electron.\n\nEven after experiments confirmed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. Niels Bohr, in his 1922 Nobel address, stated, \"The hypothesis of light-quanta is not able to throw light on the nature of radiation.\"\n\nBy 1921, when Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name in the award citation, some physicists accepted that the equation was correct and light quanta were possible. In 1923, Arthur Compton's X-ray scattering experiment helped more of the scientific community to accept this formula. The theory of light quanta was a strong indicator of wave–particle duality, a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics. A complete picture of the theory of photoelectricity was realized after the maturity of quantum mechanics.\n\nThe article \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular Kinetic Theory of Heat\"), received May 11 and published July 18, delineated a stochastic model of Brownian motion.\n\nEinstein derived expressions for the mean squared displacement of particles. Using the kinetic theory of gases, which at the time was controversial, the article established that the phenomenon, which had lacked a satisfactory explanation even decades after it was first observed, provided empirical evidence for the reality of the atom. It also lent credence to statistical mechanics, which had been controversial at that time, as well. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists debated whether atoms were real entities. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. Wilhelm Ostwald, one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told Arnold Sommerfeld that he had been convinced of the existence of atoms by Jean Perrin's subsequent Brownian motion experiments.\n\nEinstein's \"Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper\" (\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\"), his third paper that year, was received on June 30 and published September 26. It reconciles Maxwell's equations for electricity and magnetism with the laws of mechanics by introducing major changes to mechanics close to the speed of light. This later became known as Einstein's special theory of relativity.\n\nThe paper mentions the names of only five other scientists: Isaac Newton, James Clerk Maxwell, Heinrich Hertz, Christian Doppler, and Hendrik Lorentz. It does not have any references to any other publications. Many of the ideas had already been published by others, as detailed in history of special relativity and relativity priority dispute. However, Einstein's paper introduces a theory of time, distance, mass, and energy that was consistent with electromagnetism, but omitted the force of gravity.\n\nAt the time, it was known that Maxwell's equations, when applied to moving bodies, led to asymmetries (moving magnet and conductor problem), and that it had not been possible to discover any motion of the Earth relative to the 'light medium' \"(i.e. aether)\". Einstein puts forward two postulates to explain these observations. First, he applies the principle of relativity, which states that the laws of physics remain the same for any non-accelerating frame of reference (called an inertial reference frame), to the laws of electrodynamics and optics as well as mechanics. In the second postulate, Einstein proposes that the speed of light has the same value in all frames of reference, independent of the state of motion of the emitting body.\n\nSpecial relativity is thus consistent with the result of the Michelson–Morley experiment, which had not detected a medium of conductance (or aether) for light waves unlike other known waves that require a medium (such as water or air). Einstein may not have known about that experiment, but states,\nThe speed of light is fixed, and thus \"not\" relative to the movement of the observer. This was impossible under Newtonian classical mechanics. Einstein argues,\nIt had previously been proposed, by George FitzGerald in 1889 and by Lorentz in 1892, independently of each other, that the Michelson–Morley result could be accounted for if moving bodies were contracted in the direction of their motion. Some of the paper's core equations, the Lorentz transforms, had been published by Joseph Larmor (1897, 1900), Hendrik Lorentz (1895, 1899, 1904) and Henri Poincaré (1905), in a development of Lorentz's 1904 paper. Einstein's presentation differed from the explanations given by FitzGerald, Larmor, and Lorentz, but was similar in many respects to the formulation by Poincaré (1905).\n\nHis explanation arises from two axioms. First, Galileo's idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other. Einstein writes,\nThe second is the rule that the speed of light is the same for every observer.\nThe theory, now called the special theory of relativity, distinguishes it from his later general theory of relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent. Special relativity gained widespread acceptance remarkably quickly, confirming Einstein's comment that it had been \"ripe for discovery\" in 1905. Acknowledging the role of Max Planck in the early dissemination of his ideas, Einstein wrote in 1913 \"The attention that this theory so quickly received from colleagues is surely to be ascribed in large part to the resoluteness and warmth with which he [Planck] intervened for this theory\". In addition, the improved mathematical formulation of the theory by Hermann Minkowski in 1907 was influential in gaining acceptance for the theory. Also, and most importantly, the theory was supported by an ever-increasing body of confirmatory experimental evidence.\n\nOn November 21 \"Annalen der Physik\" published a fourth paper (received September 27) \"Ist die Trägheit eines Körpers von seinem Energieinhalt abhängig?\" (\"Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?\"), in which Einstein deduced what is arguably the most famous of all equations: .\n\nEinstein considered the equivalency equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that a massive particle possesses an energy, the \"rest energy\", distinct from its classical kinetic and potential energies. The paper is based on James Clerk Maxwell's and Heinrich Rudolf Hertz's investigations and, in addition, the axioms of relativity, as Einstein states,\n\nThe equation sets forth that the energy of a body at rest () equals its mass () times the speed of light () squared, or .\n\nThe mass-energy relation can be used to predict how much energy will be released or consumed by nuclear reactions; one simply measures the mass of all constituents and the mass of all the products and multiplies the difference between the two by . The result shows how much energy will be released or consumed, usually in the form of light or heat. When applied to certain nuclear reactions, the equation shows that an extraordinarily large amount of energy will be released, millions of times as much as in the combustion of chemical explosives, where mass is conserved. This explains why nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors produce such phenomenal amounts of energy, as they release binding energy during nuclear fission and nuclear fusion, and convert a portion of subatomic mass to energy.\n\nThe International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) resolved to commemorate the 100th year of the publication of Einstein's extensive work in 1905 as the 'World Year of Physics 2005'. This was subsequently endorsed by the United Nations.\n\n\n"}

He noted there was no jazz music there in his youth; like many in the United States he was introduced to the style by early recordings and touring groups at the end of the 1910s. He abandoned his family's plans for him to be a pharmacist (although retaining the medically inspired nickname \"Doc\") to play music, initially playing soprano and tenor saxophone in addition to trumpet in Nashville's African American Vaudeville theater. Cheatham later toured in band accompanying blues singers on the Theater Owners Booking Association circuit. His early jazz influences included Henry Busse and Johnny Dunn, but when he moved to Chicago in 1924 he heard King Oliver. Oliver's playing was a revelation to Cheatham. Cheatham followed the jazz King around. Oliver gave young Cheatham a mute which Cheatham treasured and performed with for the rest of his career. A further revelation came the following year when Louis Armstrong returned to Chicago. Armstrong would be a lifelong influence on Cheatham.\n\nCheatham played in Albert Wynn's band (and occasionally substituted for Armstrong at the Vendome Theater), and recorded on sax with Ma Rainey before moving to Philadelphia in 1927, where he worked with the bands of Bobby Lee and Wilbur de Paris before moving to New York City the following year. After a short stint with Chick Webb he left to tour Europe with Sam Wooding's band.\n\nCheatham returned to the United States in 1930, and played with Marion Handy and McKinney's Cotton Pickers before landing a job with Cab Calloway. Cheatham was Calloway's lead trumpeter from 1932 through 1939.\nAccording to a personal discussion with Doc Cheatham, he studied with Max Schlossberg for 6 months in 1931.I approached the topic, at Sweet Basil's, because his tone was like Schlossberg's; I had heard Schlossberg, my grand uncle, play once, at home, in 1936-[Norman M. Canter, M.D.]\nHe performed with Benny Carter, Teddy Wilson, Fletcher Henderson, and Claude Hopkins in the 1940s; after World War II he started working regularly with Latin bands in New York City, including the bands of Perez Prado, Marcelino Guerra, Ricardo Ray (on whose catchy, hook-laden album \"Jala, Jala Boogaloo, Volume II\", he played exquisitely (but uncredited), particularly on the track \"Mr. Trumpet Man\"), Machito, and others. The first time Cheatham joined Machito's band, he was fired because he couldn't cope with clave rhythm. Cheatham eventually got the hang of it though. In addition to continuing Latin gigs, he played again with Wilbur de Paris and Sammy Price. He led his own band on Broadway for five years starting in 1960, after which he toured with Benny Goodman.\n\nIn 1959, the U.S. State Department funded a trip for bandleader Herbie Mann to visit Africa, after they heard his version of \"African Suite.\" The grueling 14-week tour took place between 12/31/1959 to 4/5/1960. Personnel: Herbie Mann, Bandleader, flute and sax. Johnny Rae, vibist and arranger. Don Payne, bass Doc Cheatham, trumpet Jimmy Knepper, trombone Patato Valdez, conguero Jose Mangual, bongos. Destinations listed on official itinerary: Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria, Mozambique, Rhodesia, Tanganyika, Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, Morocco, Tunisia. \n<personal letters of Jimmy Knepper held by his daughter, Robin Knepper Mahonen>\n\nIn the 1970s, Doc Cheatham made a vigorous self-assessment to improve his playing, including taping himself and critically listening to the recordings, then endeavoring to eliminate all clichés from his playing. The discipline paid off, and Doc received ever-improving critical attention.\n\nHis singing career began almost by accident in a Paris recording studio on 2 May 1977. As a level and microphone check at the start of a recording session with Sammy Price's band, Cheatham sang and scatted his way through a couple of choruses of \"What Can I Say Dear After I Say I'm Sorry\". The miking happened to be good from the start and the tape machine was already rolling, and the track was issued on the LP \"Doc Cheatham: Good for What Ails You\". His singing was well received and Cheatham continued to sing in addition to play music for the rest of his career.\n\nCheatham toured widely in addition to his regular Sunday gig leading the band at Sweet Basil in Manhattan's Greenwich Village in his final decade. During one of his frequent trips to New Orleans, Louisiana, he met and befriended young trumpet virtuoso Nicholas Payton. In 1996 the two trumpeters and pianist Butch Thompson recorded a CD for Verve Records, \"Doc Cheatham and Nicholas Payton.\" The Recording Academy nominated Cheatham for Best Jazz Instrumental Solo and Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Individual or Group.\n\nIn 1998, Doc received a Grammy posthumously for Best Jazz Solo for \"Stardust\" on his CD, \"Doc Cheatham and Nicholas Payton.\" His wife Amanda and daughter Alicia accepted the Grammy on his behalf.\n\nDoc Cheatham continued playing until two days before his death, eleven days shy of his 92nd birthday.\n\n\nWith Benny Carter\nWith Dizzy Gillespie\nWith Herbie Mann\nWith Jay McShann\n\n"}

It was also licence-built in the United States by Clevite for the US Marine Corps, and sometimes known as Clevite rounds in this case. It had a short service life, and replacement by the Swingfire began in the mid-1960s.\n\nVigilant was a private development begun in 1956 by Vickers-Armstrongs' Guided Weapons Department at Brooklands, Surrey for the anti-tank role in the British Army, the name being formed from \"VI\"sually \"G\"uided \"I\"nfantry \"L\"ight \"AN\"ti-\"T\"ank missile.\n\nVigilant was wire-guided, optically tracked and manually guided, like the missile it replaced in service, the Malkara. In contrast to that system, however, Vigilant included a more sophisticated guidance system that imparted changes in velocity that produced a much smoother and more predictable motion, whereas the Malkara was considered difficult to accurately guide. The same system was reused in the later Swingfire missile.\n\nAs well as infantry use, Vigilant could be mounted on vehicles such as the Ferret armoured car and Land Rovers. Vigilant had a short service life as Swingfire started to replace Vigilant from 1966 onwards.\n\nThe missile system could be deployed in a number of configurations. The man-portable configuration consists of a launcher which doubles up as a transport container, a combined sight and controller, a battery and a 63 meter long cable. An optional Missile Selector Box allowed up to 6 missiles to be controlled by, and widely separated from, a single sight controller. The launcher box is placed on the ground facing the direction of expected targets, and then connected by the cable to the sight controller, which can be deployed some distance away. The sight controller is a pistol grip design, with two grips. The front grip has the launch trigger, and the rear grip has a thumb joystick for steering the missile. A low-magnification (3.2x) monocular forms the sight itself. Engraved stadia lines allow simple ranging, based on a typical tank target bridging the lines once in range.\n\nThe operator tracks the target using the sight mechanism, then launches the missile using the front trigger. Once the missile is in flight, he steers the missile into his line of sight using the thumb joystick. The missile's auto pilot uses a gyroscope to maintain a straight flightpath directly away from the launch point, compensating for any wind buffeting. When the operator moves the joystick, the missile applies a steering correction in the appropriate direction, once the joystick is released the opposite correction is applied automatically, keeping the missile travelling directly away from the launch point. Vigilant has a reputation for ease of control and high success with minimal operator training. This was largely due to the 'velocity control' method of Vigilant, relying on gyroscopes, rather than the simpler 'acceleration control' of competing missiles such as Entac or SS.11.\n\nThe missile reaches its maximum range of 1,375 meters in 12.5 seconds. In testing, the missile's shaped charge warhead penetrated 576 millimeters of armour of 30 to 35 HRC. Two type of warheads were provided for the Vigilant: A British developed warhead with a collapsible probe that extends on launch which can achieve maximum penetration, and one developed by Swiss firm CML with a blunter nose which has a hardened steel ring which, on oblique strikes, will dig into the armor and swing the shape charge warhead around for better penetration.\n\n\n\n"}

He had a traumatic religious upbringing. At the age of fourteen, during a difficult stage of his life, his father committed suicide by hanging himself. Crevel studied English at the University of Paris. He met André Breton and joined the surrealist movement in 1921, from which he would be excluded in October 1923 due to Crevel's bisexuality and Breton's belief that the movement had been corrupted.\n\nDuring this period, Crevel wrote novels such as \"Mon corps et moi\" (\"My Body and Me\"). In 1926, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis which made him start using morphine. The 1929 exile of Léon Trotsky persuaded him to rejoin the surrealists. Remaining faithful to André Breton, he struggled to bring communists and surrealists closer together. Much of Crevel's work deals with his inner turmoil at being bisexual.\n\nCrevel killed himself by turning on the gas on his kitchen stove the night of 18 June 1935, several weeks before his 35th birthday. There were at least two direct reasons: (1) There was a conflict between Breton and Ilya Ehrenburg during the first \"International Congress of Writers for the Defense of Culture\" which opened in Paris in June 1935. Breton, who, like all fellow surrealists, had been insulted by Ehrenburg in a pamphlet which said – among other things – that surrealists were pederasts, slapped Ehrenburg several times on the street, which led to surrealists being expelled from the Congress. Crevel, who, according to Salvador Dalí, was \"the only serious communist among surrealists\", spent a whole day trying to persuade the other delegates to allow surrealists back, but he was not successful and left the Congress at 11pm, totally exhausted. (2) Crevel reportedly had learned that he suffered from renal tuberculosis right upon leaving the Congress (Claude Courtot). He left a note which read \"\"Please cremate my body. Loathing.\"\"\n\nIt should be remembered that when André Breton included the question \"Suicide: Is It a Solution?\" in the first issue of \"La Révolution surréaliste\" in 1925, Crevel was one of those who answered \"Yes\". He wrote \"It is most probably the most correct and most ultimate solution.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Size and solidity can vary from a plastic kit to something resembling a real house in a child's size. Usually there is one room, a doorway with a window on either side, and little or no furniture other than that which the children improvise.\n\nThe original was built for Wendy Darling in J. M. Barrie's play, \"Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up\". Wendy was shot by the Lost Boy Tootles after arriving in Neverland, so Peter Pan and the Lost Boys built a small house around her where she had fallen. It was inspired by the wash-house behind Barrie's childhood home in Kirriemuir and first appeared in story form in \"The Little White Bird\" in which fairies build a house around Mamie Mannering—the prototype for Wendy—so protecting her from the cold.\n\nA prop house was created by Barrie for the first stage production of the play in 1904. It was constructed like a tent so that it could be erected quickly during a song which Wendy starts with:\n\nJohn's hat was used as a chimney and a slipper was used as a door knocker. Toy manufacturers soon created replicas of the stage Wendy house, which have become a standard toy found in British gardens ever since.\n\nIn South Africa, Wendy houses are a form of accommodation for low-income people. The structure is usually erected in someone's backyard. Although many people may view this as temporary accommodation, many families have lived in such a structure for years. It is very common among the black population in South Africa; among the larger black population it is often constructed from corrugated iron instead of wood.\n\nThe term \"wendy house\" usually refers to the wooden temporary accommodation, although there are various other types. Corrugated iron structures are called \"shacks\", while cement board structures are called \"nutecs\".\n\nAmong the more affluent population, wendy houses are used as entertainment huts, children's playhouses, or for storage.\n\nGlobally, the term \"playhouse\" is more generic and more common than the term Wendy house. A few online companies offer rustic, inflatable, or corrugated iron varieties: these are usually set up by the individuals directly to avoid the price increase that comes with external suppliers. Most of the online established companies set up only wooden or nutec structures. The quality of these companies varies greatly. A playhouse may become a hide-away, fort, club house in a child's imagination or simply a place to \"play house\" in imitation of adult behavior. Treehouses or tents sometimes serve as a playhouse or secret vantage point for children.\n\nA Cubby House is another name for playhouses. There are both indoor and outdoor children's playhouses and manufactured kits for assembly by adults or children. A playhouse may become a hide-away or club house in a child's imagination. Treehouses built by or for adults are often appropriated by children as a secret vantage point and may become a safety concern.\n\n"}

{"id": "2038979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038979", "title": "Ben Wyvis", "text": "Ben Wyvis\n\nBen Wyvis (, meaning \"hill of terror\") is a mountain located in Easter Ross, north-west of Dingwall in northern Scotland. It lies in the council area of Highland, and the county of Ross and Cromarty. The mountain is prominent in views of the area, presenting a whale-back shape above the farmland of Strathconon. Geologically, the ridge is composed of Moine pelitic gneiss.\n\nIt forms an undulating ridge running roughly north-south for about 5 km, the highest summit of which is Glas Leathad Mòr. To the south lies the Corbett of Little Wyvis, which is separated from Ben Wyvis by the Bealach Mòr. The A835 road between Dingwall and Ullapool runs to the west and south of these mountains, whilst the Kyle of Lochalsh railway line passes to the south, following a route between Dingwall and Kyle of Lochalsh. Loch Glass lies to the northeast, whilst the land to the northwest is mountainous and largely uninhabited, and crossed by no roads until the A837, some 30 km to the north.\n\nBen Wyvis is an important habitat for several species of plants and birds, and is designated as a National Nature Reserve (NNR), a Special Protection Area (SPA), a Special Area of Conservation (SAC), and a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Of particular importance is the woolly hair-moss that covers the summit plateau. This springy moss provides ideal nesting territory for dotterel that breed here each summer: Ben Wyvis represents at least 2.4% of the breeding population in Great Britain.\n\nBen Wyvis is primarily composed of Moine schist, which was formed as sediment around 1,000 to 870 million years ago during a period when the landmass that is now Scotland was covered by shallow seas. As the amount of sediment increased the layers underwent metamorphism due to the increased temperature and pressure, resulting in the formation of a hard, water-resistant rock. This schist was subjected to further upheaval during the Caledonian orogeny, leading to formation of waves and folds which are visible in the rocks.\n\nDuring the Ice Age much of Scotland was periodically covered by ice sheets, with glaciers forming in corries and glens. During the final phase of this period, much of Ben Wyvis was covered by ice. The presence of glacial erratic boulders can be interpreted as marking the upper extent of the ice sheet, with the top of Ben Wyvis remaining free of ice.\n\nBen Wyvis stands on the northern edge of historic lands of Clan Munro. By tradition, the Munros held their land from the Crown. The king declared that they held their lands on condition of furnishing a snowball at midsummer if required. This condition they could easily fulfil, as snow was to be found in some of the mountain corries of their property all year round.\n\nThe Battle of Bealach nam Broig was fought between rival clans near the pass that separates Ben Wyvis from the lower summit of Carn Mòr, which lies to the northwest. Clans from lands to the north-west who were allied to Clan Mackenzie fought against north-eastern clans (including Clan Munro) who supported the Earl of Ross. The actual date of the battle is debated, but is thought to be 1452.\n\nFrom the sixteenth century cattle-droving was one of the major economic activities in the highlands, and Ben Wyvis lay near to a major drove road between northwest Scotland and the cattle markets of the south. Drovers often took a shortcut across the southern flanks of the mountain, following the Allt á Bhealaich Mhòir before crossing the bealach between Ben Wyvis and Little Wyvis before rejoining the main route near Auchterneed. The drove road was still being used into the early twentieth century. There are remains of a settlement at Garbat which may have been used as a holding point for the drovers and their cattle. The sites of buildings (including iron workings) found along the Allt á Bhealaich Mhòir are also thought to date from this period.\n\nThe southern and western sides of Ben Wyvis are now owned by Scottish Natural Heritage, forming the Ben Wyvis NNR, whilst the northern and eastern flanks form part of a privately owned sporting estate, Wyvis Estate. The lower slopes to the west of the NNR are forested, and owned by Forestry and Land Scotland. As with all land in Scotland, there is a right of responsible access to most of the land on and surrounding Ben Wyvis under the Scottish Outdoor Access Code for people wishing to undertake pursuits such as walking, cycling, horse-riding and wild camping: this applies regardless of whether the land is in public or private ownership.\n\nBen Wyvis is home to over 170 plant species, including the nationally scarce dwarf birch, as well as other rare species, such as alpine foxtail. The summit ridge of Ben Wyvis is carpeted moss-heath, forming one of the longest single tracts of this habitat anywhere in Britain. The summit plateau is dominated by the woolly hair-moss \"Racomitrium lanuginosum\", whilst little shaggy moss \"Rhytidiadelphus loreus\" is found in areas that experience regular snow cover due to drifting. The lower slopes of the mountain support dwarf shrub heath and boglands, which is home to a variety of plants including dwarf birch, cloudberry, dwarf cornel and alpine bearberry.\n\nSeveral species of butterfly are found at Ben Wyvis, including the pearl-bordered fritillary and the large heath butterfly. The area is also home to several species of dragonfly including the large red damselfly and the golden-ringed dragonfly. The mountain is an important breeding ground for the dotterel, which use the moss-heath of the plateau to breed: Ben Wyvis represents at least 2.4% of the breeding population for dotterel in Great Britain. Ptarmigan also breed on upland areas of the reserve, nesting in higher areas among the boulders and scree. Other birds at Ben Wyvis include golden plover, red grouse and ravens, as well as birds of prey such as peregrine falcon and golden eagle.\n\nDeer are common at Ben Wyvis, with red deer in particular being frequently seen. Sika deer can be occasionally spotted at the edges of the woodland that fringe the area, with roe deer also preferring the cover of the forest. Other mammals at Ben Wyvis include mountain hare on the open slopes, and pine marten in the woodland. Deer numbers are managed via an annual cull in order to reduce grazing pressures on vegetation. Culling at Ben Wyvis undertaken by a leaseholder, who rents the deer stalking rights from SNH.\n\nThe Ben Wyvis National Nature Reserve encompasses the western and southern slopes of Ben Wyvis, and the summit plateau of Glas Leathad Mòr, which stands at 1,046 metres above sea level. Managed by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), the reserve contains a range of important habitats for wildlife, as well as important geological features. The reserve habitats range from scattered native woodland and shrub-rich heath on the lower slopes, moorland further upland, and a mosaic of upland communities on the high tops and crags.\n\nThe Reserve was established in 1982, and extended to include additional land on the southern and western side of the mountain in 1985. In 1996 the boundary was altered again, excluding land that was not owned by SNH from the reserve. The NNR is classified as a Category II protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Ben Wyvis is also designated as a Special Protection Area (SPA), a Special Area of Conservation (SAC), and a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).\n\nBen Wyvis is usually climbed from the west, starting just south of Garbat on the A835 road, where there is a car park maintained by Forestry and Land Scotland. The path follows the north bank of the Allt á Bhealaich Mhòir through the forest, before entering the NNR. From here the route ascends more steeply to reach An Cabar, the southernmost of the summits that lie along the main ridge. An alternative route, also accessed from the car park, takes in the Top of Tom a' Choinnich, which lies to north of the main summit: the two routes can be combined to make a circular route.\n\nThe popularity of Ben Wyvis with visitors, coupled with the fact that moss-heath is much more susceptible to damage than grass or heather, has led to significant erosion on the main ascent route. On the summit plateau the path has become \"braided\" into several adjacent routes. Since 2011 SNH have been undertaking restoration work; on slopes leading to the summit plateau this has involved the use of traditional path-building techniques. On the summit plateau however SNH have trialled an alternative method, encouraging the use of a single route to allow bare areas to recover by removing loose stones and transplanting small sections of vegetation.\n\nDuring the 1980s there were proposals for the construction of downhill skiing infrastructure on Ben Wyvis.\n\n"}

She was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 2011.\n\nIn 1927, Eustis was 41 years old and living in Switzerland where she bred German Shepherds as police dogs when she wrote an article for \"The Saturday Evening Post\", a popular weekly magazine. The piece described a German dog guide training school for blind veterans of the First World War and sparked a flood of mail, including a letter from a 20-year-old blind man named Morris Frank who promised to help set up a similar school in the United States if Eustis would train him to use a dog guide. Eustis invited Frank to Switzerland, where he spent five weeks learning to work with Buddy, the first of his six dog guides (all named Buddy). A year later, in December 1928, Eustis and Frank launched The Seeing Eye in Frank’s hometown of Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nEustis’ legacy has been long-lasting. Her work helped spawn dog guide schools in the United States and around the world, and also paved the way for using service animals to help people with all kinds of disabilities. Because The Seeing Eye refused to see its students as charity cases, Eustis is also credited with helping to change public attitudes toward the disabled and contributing to the disability rights movement that began in the 1970s.\n\nThe sixth and youngest child of businessman and philanthropist Charles Custis Harrison and his wife Ellen Nixon Waln Harrison, Eustis grew up in a prominent Philadelphia family whose social circle included some of the most influential people of their day. Her father, Charles C. Harrison, was the grandson of John Harrison, who established the first chemical factory in the United States. Charles owned a highly profitable sugar refinery, which he and his partners sold for a reported price of $10 million. He then became the provost at his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, and raised an estimated $11 million for the university over 16 years.\n\nEustis’s mother was the great-granddaughter of Robert Morris, who helped fund the American Revolution and the great-great-granddaughter of John Nixon, who was chosen to do the public reading of The Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia four days after it was signed. Ellen Harrison was also active at the University of Pennsylvania, raising money for the university hospital and overseeing the landscaping of the university grounds.\n\nEustis attended the Agnes Irwin School, a private girls' school in Philadelphia from the fall of 1901 through the spring 1903, and then attended the Rathgowrie School in England.\n\nEustis married her first husband, Walter Abbott Wood Jr., the wealthy son of a farm machinery manufacturer, on Oct. 6, 1906 in Old St. David’s Church in St. David’s, Pa. and then moved to her husband’s hometown of Hoosick Falls, New York, a small community just ten miles south of the Vermont border. The couple had two children: Walter Abbott III (1907–1993) and Harrison (1914–1938) .\n\nDuring her years in Hoosick Falls, Eustis and her husband, a local politician, developed an experimental breeding program for cattle on their farm. In 1914, during a trip to Europe with her husband, Eustis acquired her first German Shepherd, a dog named Hans. The dog later proved to be part of the inspiration for The Seeing Eye. As Willi Ebeling, who worked closely with Eustis to get The Seeing Eye off the ground and served as the organization’s executive vice president for many years, explained: \"The first half of his [Han's] life was spent bringing his owners to the realization of what a wonderful dog the old-fashioned German Shepherd really was. The last half of his life was spent watching his owners attempt to regain the old over the present day breed; (sic) to find and retain the working temperament and the usefulness that was present in the breed before the great war (World War I)\".\n\nA turning point in Eustis' life came Oct. 8, 1915, when husband Walter died of complications from typhoid fever, making her a 29-year-old widow with two young children, ages 1 and 8. She returned to Philadelphia in 1917, and married a second time on June 23, 1923, this time to George Eustis, a polo player 13 years her junior and the stepson of the pianist Josef Hofmann. Shortly after their wedding, the couple began renting Hofmann’s chalet on Mt. Pèlerin in the Swiss Alps and started breeding German shepherds and training them to work as police dogs. To help them with their project, they hired Elliot \"Jack\" Humphrey, a self-taught geneticist and animal trainer. Humphrey would later be instrumental in developing the method for training dogs, as well as students, at The Seeing Eye.\n\nOn Nov. 5, 1927, \"The Saturday Evening Post\" published the article that would change Eustis' life. Written in the first person, the story chronicled Eustis' observations at a school outside of Berlin that trained German war veterans who had been blinded by mustard gas in World War I. Soon the publishing company was forwarding her piles of letters from readers who wanted to know more. One stood out from the rest. It was from Morris Frank, the young man from Nashville Tenn.\n\n“Is what you say really true?’’ Frank wrote. “If so, I want one of those dogs! And I am not alone. Thousands of blind like me abhor being dependent on others. Help me and I will help them. Train me and I will bring back my dog and show people here how a blind man can be absolutely on his own. We can then set up an instruction center in this country to give all those here who want it a chance at a new life.’’ By the end of 1928, Eustis had divorced her second husband George and launched a new venture: The Seeing Eye.\n\nFor the first three years of its existence, The Seeing Eye had no permanent facility, so trainers traveled to different cities to hold their classes. That changed in 1931 when Eustis purchased a ten-bedroom mansion in Whippany, New Jersey that had enough room to house students while they were learning to work with their dogs. The school relocated to a newly constructed, and more user-friendly facility in Morristown in 1966.\n\nEustis continued to play an active role in the affairs of The Seeing Eye until 1940 when she resigned as president and took on the role of honorary president and a member of the board of trustees. By then she had also become increasingly more devoted to Christian Science, and had begun a Christian Science healing practice. (Although she grew up in the Episcopal Church, she became a Christian Scientist around 1926.) Eustis continued the practice until 1945, the year before she died.\n\nEustis died in her New York City home on September 8, 1946. She was 60 years old.\n"}

It relies on the mathematical methods of spherical geometry and the measurements of astrometry.\n\nThis is the oldest branch of astronomy and dates back to antiquity. Observations of celestial objects have been, and continue to be, important for religious and astrological purposes, as well as for timekeeping and navigation. The science of actually measuring positions of celestial objects in the sky is known as astrometry.\n\nThe primary elements of spherical astronomy are celestial coordinate systems and time. The coordinates of objects on the sky are listed using the equatorial coordinate system, which is based on the projection of Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere. The position of an object in this system is given in terms of right ascension (α) and declination (δ). The latitude and local time can then be used to derive the position of the object in the horizontal coordinate system, consisting of the altitude and azimuth.\n\nThe coordinates of celestial objects such as stars and galaxies are tabulated in a star catalog, which gives the position for a particular year. However, the combined effects of axial precession and nutation will cause the coordinates to change slightly over time. The effects of these changes in Earth's motion are compensated by the periodic publication of revised catalogs.\n\nTo determine the position of the Sun and planets, an astronomical ephemeris (a table of values that gives the positions of astronomical objects in the sky at a given time) is used, which can then be converted into suitable real-world coordinates.\n\nThe unaided human eye can perceive about 6,000 stars, of which about half are below the horizon at any one time. On modern star charts, the celestial sphere is divided into 88 constellations. Every star lies within a constellation. Constellations are useful for navigation. Polaris lies nearly due north to an observer in the Northern Hemisphere. This pole star is always at a position nearly directly above the North Pole.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

King is now best remembered for his first-hand account of traditional agricultural practices in Asia, now regarded as an organic farming classic text.\n\nKing served as a professor of agricultural physics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison from 1888 until 1902. Interested in a wide range of subjects throughout his career, King made major contributions during these years in research and teaching that dealt with applications of physics to agriculture. Most attention was given to soil physics, for example, water-holding capacities of soils, moisture requirements of plants, aeration, movement of water in soils, movement of groundwater, the drafts of plows, and the lifting power of windmills; he also began studies of soil fertility. The impact of his career was greatest in the field of soil science. He has been called the father of soil physics in the United States.\n\nKing left Wisconsin to become chief of the Division of Soil Management in the USDA Bureau of Soils in Washington, D.C. in January 1902. His findings in the next two years, that the concentration of nutrients in soil solution was correlated with crop yields, began to undermine beliefs held strongly by the chief of the bureau, Milton Whitney, about the relations of soil chemistry to plant growth and soil fertility. King was forced to resign but privately published several additional papers from his research during this period.\n\nKing returned to Madison, where he devoted the last seven years of his life to summarizing earlier findings and conducting further research in agricultural physics, including the ventilation of farm buildings. Three of his seven books were written during that period, the best known of which is \"Farmers of Forty Centuries, or Permanent Agriculture in China, Korea, and Japan\", which recounted his investigations into what would now be called organic farming or sustainable agriculture during a nine-month tour of Asia in 1909. The last chapter was completed after his death, in 1911, by Carrie Baker King, his wife, who then published the book that same year. It has been described by Lord Northbourne—the founder of organic agriculture—as a \"classic\" which \"no student of farming or social science can afford to ignore\".\n\nHe is most popularly known for designing the cylindrical storage silo, which reduces the occurrence of spoilage in the silage. Some have speculated that Frank Lloyd Wright's design of the Guggenheim Museum was influenced by King's designs. King is commemorated at the University of Wisconsin–Madison by King Hall, so renamed in 1934, which is the same Agricultural Physics Hall in which he worked during his tenure there and which now houses part of the Department of Soil Science (formed by the 1904 reorganization of King's original department into the 'Soils Department' and the 'Agricultural Engineering Department'), and by the F. H. King Students for Sustainable Agriculture, a student organization that grows various crops that are given away to community residents to raise awareness of sustainable farming and gardening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

However the Lebanese crisis adversely affected TMA growth and operation. In November 1996, following the Lebanese \"Horizon 2000\" reconstruction plan, the airline took measures to modernise its operations, restructure activities and increase capital to around $40 million. TMA is owned by Lebanese Air Investment Holding (99.9%) and private investors (0.1%). \n\nIn 2000, TMA introduced a new livery to their fleet.

The joint becomes distended by excess synovial fluid and/or thickened synovial tissue bringing about a soft, fluctuant swelling on the front of the joint, as well as in the medial and lateral plantar pouches. Bog spavin is generally an indication of underlying pathology within the joint.\n\nBog spavin is a physical finding, and does not directly create lameness. Causes include synovitis (inflammation of the lining of the joint capsule), degenerative joint disease, or excessive strain of the joint capsule. In horses younger than the age of three, most cases of bog spavin are caused by a defect in the tibiotarsal joint, while in older, fully mature horses, it is most likely because of chronic strain of the joint capsule. Infection of the joint causes a severe synovitis, and should be treated as an emergency. \n\nMany horses with bog spavin will not be lame. However, bog spavin can be a sign that the horse has joint disease, which is a very significant finding. Usually lameness will occur if the workload of the horse is increased. Bog spavin should not be treated lightly, and it is best to have a veterinarian examine the horse to find the cause, even if the horse does not appear lame.\n\nUnlike bone spavin, bog spavin does not show any changes to the bone itself. For this reason it is considered to be of no interest to those studying animal paleopathology (Baker and Brothwell, 1980).\n\nA veterinarian will usually radiograph the hocks of the horse to check for bony changes as it is important to address the underlying cause of the joint distension. It's important to have a veterinarian perform an equine prepurchase exam to identify an existing condition such as a bog spavin. If the bog spavin is drained then it will simply refill unless the underlying cause has healed or been treated. In many cases it may be difficult to achieve resolution of the distension. Treatment may involve injection of corticosteroids or hyaluronan into the joint and some cases may require arthroscopic surgery. Rest or controlled exercise is often indicated.\n\n"}
{"id": "2039100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2039100", "title": "Henrique Galvão", "text": "Henrique Galvão\n\nHenrique Galvão (February 4, 1895 – June 25, 1970) was a Portuguese military officer, writer and politician. He was initially a supporter but later become one of the strongest opponents of the Portuguese Estado Novo under Salazar.\n\nIn the 1940s, while serving as the Angolan Deputy to the Portuguese National Assembly, Henrique Galvão read his \"Report on Native Problems in the Portuguese Colonies\" before the Assembly. In this report, Galvão condemned the \"shameful outrages\" he had uncovered, notably the forced labour of \"women, of children, [and] of decrepit old men.\" He concluded that, in Angola, \"only the dead are really exempt from forced labor\". Furthermore, he insisted that as many as 30% of all Angolan forced labourers died. Galvão cited the government's policy of replacing deceased native workers, without directly charging the employer, as being instrumental in encouraging the poor care of the workers. Galvão further claimed that this practice would often then result in their death. Galvão claimed that this state policy, which he said differed from policy in other colonial societies, eliminated the employer's incentive to maintain the welfare of the workers. He therefore accused the Portuguese government, due to its colonial policies, for the elimination of native workers in Angola. The Portuguese government rejected these accusations and ignored Galvão's report. Galvão was arrested in 1952. He was compulsorily retired from his military career, but was awarded a state pension. In 1959, he escaped from Portugal to Venezuela. He continued to oppose the \"New State\" at that time.\n\nShortly before the events that would lead to the Portuguese Colonial War, on January 22, 1961, Galvão led the Santa Maria hijacking, also known as \"Operation Dulcinea\". The hijackers, characterized by many as terrorists or rebels, seized the ship and took complete command of the vessel under Galvão's leadership. In this process, they isolated the vessel by cutting off all communication, and killed one officer and wounded several others. Galvão used the hijacking to send radio broadcasts from the ship calling attention to his concerns and views on what he characterized as the Portuguese regime of fascism. The event received wide international press coverage. It is understood that the hijackers forced the captain of the ship, Mário Simões Maia, along with crew members, to redirect the ship's course. The liner evaded both the U.S. Navy and British Royal Navy for eleven days before docking safely at Recife, Brazil. On February 2, 1961, the hijackers were met by Brazilian officials off the coast of Recife. After negotiating with Brazilian officials, Galvão released the ship's passengers in exchange for his own political asylum in Brazil. Galvão later announced that his original intentions for this operation were to sail the ship to the Portuguese overseas province of Angola. Galvão further claimed that he had planned to declare the independence of Angola from the Portuguese government, in opposition to António de Oliveira Salazar's regime. Galvão remained exiled in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, where he subsequently died in 1970.\n\nHenrique Galvão's elegant writing can be seen in famous published works, including, as co-author with Teodósio Cabral and Abel Pratas, \"Da vida e da morte dos bichos: subsídios para o estudo da fauna de Angola e notas de caça\" (Of Animals Life and Death: Contributions to the Study of the Fauna of Angola and Hunting Notes), e.g., elephants, rhinos, lions, cheetahs, buffaloes, etc., Lisbon, Livraria Popular de Francisco Franco, Portuguese National Library refs.B.R. 11955-9), a landmark study published in five volumes in 1933, and \"Outras Terras, Outras Gentes\". Galvão's stories of the Santa Maria hijacking were translated into English and into a book as \"Santa Maria: My Crusade for Portugal\" (New York, 1961).\n"}

The legislature, Cumhuriyet Meclisi (Assembly of the Republic of Northern Cyprus), has 50 members, elected for a five-year term by mitigated proportional representation. The territory has a multi-party system, with two or three strong parties and another party which is also electorally successful.\n\nIn the presidential election, a candidate must obtain at least 50% of the votes in order to secure a first-ballot victory. Upon failing to do so, the two top candidates compete in a runoff election, with the winner assuming the presidency.\n\nThe mitigated proportional representation system in use for legislative elections obligates each party to cross the 5% of the total vote election threshold in order to be seated in the 50-member parliament, which is chosen from five districts: Lefkoşa, Gazimağusa, Girne, Güzelyurt and İskele.\n\nIn the parliamentary elections, voters choose individual candidates with two options in the manner of voting: a party-line vote which, in effect, means a vote for each candidate from that party in that election district or, alternatively, the voter may choose different MP candidates from various parties. In this type of mixed voting, the voter may not choose more than the number of MPs from that district.\n\nResidents of Northern Cyprus are eligible to stand for election and vote in the national elections of the Republic of Cyprus, but not able to run for presidency (the Constitution states that a Turkish-Cypriot should be Vice-President of the Republic). Turkish Cypriot communal representation in the Republic of Cyprus government \"de facto\" ended in 1963. Until 2004, the case of Ibrahim Aziz in the European Court of Human Rights, Turkish Cypriots could not vote in the Republic of Cyprus.\n\nNote: Each voter may cast multiple votes, one for each seat in the parliament. Hence, the vote totals of some parties exceed the number of registered voters.\n\nIn 2009 President Mehmet Ali Talat claimed that in 1990 and 1998 Turkish government officials along with other influential powers from Turkey interfered with the Parliamentary Elections.\n"}

In a 4 to 3 decision, the Court found the Acts violated Quebecers' right to life and security of person under the Quebec Charter. The ruling is binding only in Quebec. Three of the seven judges also found that the laws violated section seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. One judge did not rule on the Canadian Charter. The result was a 3–3 tie on the question of the Canadian Charter, so Chaoulli decision does not apply to any other province. \n\nHaving suffered in the past from numerous health problems including a hip replacement, 73-year-old salesman George Zeliotis became an advocate for reducing waiting times for patients in Quebec hospitals.\n\nJacques Chaoulli is a doctor who provided home appointments to patients. He attempted to get a licence to offer his services as an independent private hospital but was rejected due to provincial legislation prohibiting private health insurance.\n\nTogether, the two men sought a declaratory judgment to contest the prohibition.\n\nThree separate opinions were written. The first is by Deschamps who found a violation of the Quebec Charter, but stated there was no necessity for her to rule on the Canadian Charter . A second opinion was written by McLachlin C.J. and Major J., with Bastarache J. concurring, on the violation of section seven. A dissenting opinion was given by Binnie and LeBel JJ. with Fish J. concurring in dissent.\n\nDeschamps begins by identifying the issue as being whether the prohibition is \"justified by the need to preserve the integrity of the public system\" and not questioning the single-tier health system itself. In examining the legislative context of the case, she warns against politicizing the issue and against taking an emotional tone to the judgment.\n\nThe appeal court's characterization of the issue as an infringement of an economic right is rejected by Deschamps. She goes on to note that the long waits at hospitals can result in deaths and that private health care prohibited by the Quebec Acts would likely have saved those lives. The wait lists, she claims, are an implicit form of rationing, and it is the government's rationing policy that is being challenged here as a violation of the right to \"security of person\" (\"per\" Canadian Charter) and \"personal inviolability\" (\"per\" Quebec Charter).\n\nDeschamps sides with the trial judge, who found a violation of section 7 of the Canadian Charter, but she interprets it as being more of a violation of the similar section 1 of the Quebec Charter. She adopts a broad interpretation, citing \"R. v. Morgentaler\" among others as examples of delay in medical treatment as a violation of security of person. She further rejects the dissenters' suggestion that a patient could seek medical treatment outside of the province as too extreme and case-specific.\n\nTurning to the requisite analysis to justify the violation, Deschamps points to the \"minimal impairment\" expectation to be the one of the most interest. Expert and witness testimony was examined of which she found it to be not particularly credible or useful. She then examines other provinces' health legislation, finding the lack of prohibitory legislation allows her to conclude that the Quebec Acts are not necessary to preserve the public health plan. Studies on public health programs in other countries examined by Deschamps support this claim.\n\nThe issue of deference to government is considered. \"When the courts are given the tools they need to make a decision, they should not hesitate to assume their responsibilities,\" she states, claiming that social policies developed by the government should not be shied away from by the courts. Deference should be given only with a justification consistent with democratic values and sufficiently necessary to maintain public order.\n\nIn concluding, Deschamp points her finger squarely at the government and suggests the need for change:\n\nBoth McLachlin and Major agree with Deschamp's reasoning but rely more on section 7 and section 1 of the Canadian Charter to reach the same outcome. They observe that the \"Charter does not confer a freestanding constitutional right to health care. However, where the government puts in place a scheme to provide health care, that scheme must comply with the Charter.\" \n\nTo determine a violation of the Charter, they look at how the Quebec Acts differ from the \"Canada Health Act\"'. They note that unlike with other legislation, the impugned Acts remove the ability to contract for private health care insurance and in effect create a virtual monopoly for the public health system. On the evidence of significant delays in service, this monopoly harms the right to security of person. Delays in medical treatment could have physical and stressful consequences.\n\nIn reviewing the public health care systems of several countries they find that the connection was missing. In defence of this, they criticize the dissenters' rejection of international data as well and reliance on what they characterized as inconsistent reports from Romanow and Senator Kirby.\n\nThey begin by phrasing the question as being not one of rationing, but rather\n\nThey then describe the problem as an issue of public policy and social values which is not for the courts to decide.\nThe characterization of the problem by the majority contains too much ambiguity, they claim. How can the court determine what is a \"reasonable\" wait time, they ask?\n\nBinnie and LeBel primarily take issue with the majority's claim that the law is arbitrary contrary to the principles of fundamental justice.\n\nThe dissenters' interpretation of the legislation finds a rational connection to the objectives of the Canadian Health Act:\n\nThey admit agreeing with the majority and the trial judge that the law will put \"some\" Quebecers life and \"security of person\" at risk, but they do not see the matter being resolved by or applicable to the constitution. They state that \"it will likely be a rare case where s. 7 will apply in circumstances entirely unrelated to adjudicative or administrative proceedings.\" However, they claim, this is not one of those times. Instead, they lament the overextension of the constitution:\nIn effect, the dissenters say, the Court is only protecting the right to contract and pushing Canada into its own Lochner era, while dismissing those that claimed privatizing will not necessarily solve the problem.\n\nThey characterize the majority's use of the word \"arbitrary\" as meaning \"unnecessary,\" claiming that if that were true, it would require the courts to interfere too much with lawmakers.\n\nThe dissenters' final objection is the majority's expansion of the reasoning in \"R. v. Morgentaler\". Binnie and LeBel distinguish \"R. v. Morgentaler\" from the current case, as the former was about \"manifest unfairness\" and criminal liability, not arbitrariness and public health policy, which, they claim, requires a very different analytical approach.\n\nThe decision proved to be highly contentious by its political nature and its conflict with the present government's policy on health. There are those, who argue that this decision could potentially lead to the dismantling of the Canadian Medicare system, while others suggest that this could be a much-needed wake-up call to repair the ailing system.\n\nThis ruling could have a direct effect on most provinces that currently have laws that are designed to discourage the private sector, in particular Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia, Alberta, and Prince Edward Island, which all have legislation very similar to the impugned laws in Quebec.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court rendered its judgment, the Attorney General of Quebec asked the Court to stay (suspend) its judgment for 18 months. The Court granted the stay for only 12 months; it therefore expired on June 8, 2006.\n\nIn August 2005, delegates to the Canadian Medical Association adopted a motion supporting access to private-sector health services and private medical insurance in circumstances where patients cannot obtain timely access to care through the single-payer health care system.\n\nIn November 2005, a Quebec provincial white paper on limited private reforms was leaked to the media. The paper proposed allowing the purchase of private medical insurance. To prevent doctors from abandoning the public system, the paper would force doctors to perform a minimum amount of work in the public sector before they would be allowed to perform in the private sector.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2039133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2039133", "title": "Theoretical astronomy", "text": "Theoretical astronomy\n\nTheoretical astronomy is the use of the analytical models of physics and chemistry to describe astronomical objects and astronomical phenomena.\n\nPtolemy's Almagest, although a brilliant treatise on theoretical astronomy combined with a practical handbook for computation, nevertheless includes many compromises to reconcile discordant observations. Theoretical astronomy is usually assumed to have begun with Johannes Kepler (1571–1630), and Kepler's laws. It is co-equal with observation. The general history of astronomy deals with the history of the descriptive and theoretical astronomy of the Solar System, from the late sixteenth century to the end of the nineteenth century. The major categories of works on the history of modern astronomy include general histories, national and institutional histories, instrumentation, descriptive astronomy, theoretical astronomy, positional astronomy, and astrophysics. Astronomy was early to adopt computational techniques to model stellar and galactic formation and celestial mechanics. From the point of view of theoretical astronomy, not only must the mathematical expression be reasonably accurate but it should preferably exist in a form which is amenable to further mathematical analysis when used in specific problems. Most of theoretical astronomy uses Newtonian theory of gravitation, considering that the effects of general relativity are weak for most celestial objects. The obvious fact is that theoretical astronomy cannot (and does not try to) predict the position, size and temperature of every star in the heavens. Theoretical astronomy by and large has concentrated upon analyzing the apparently complex but periodic motions of celestial objects.\n\n\"Contrary to the belief generally held by laboratory physicists, astronomy has contributed to the growth of our understanding of physics.\" Physics has helped in the elucidation of astronomical phenomena, and astronomy has helped in the elucidation of physical phenomena:\n\nIntegrating astronomy with physics involves\nThe aim of astronomy is to understand the physics and chemistry from the laboratory that is behind cosmic events so as to enrich our understanding of the cosmos and of these sciences as well.\n\nAstrochemistry, the overlap of the disciplines of astronomy and chemistry, is the study of the abundance and reactions of chemical elements and molecules in space, and their interaction with radiation. The formation, atomic and chemical composition, evolution and fate of molecular gas clouds, is of special interest because it is from these clouds that solar systems form.\n\nInfrared astronomy, for example, has revealed that the interstellar medium contains a suite of complex gas-phase carbon compounds called aromatic hydrocarbons, often abbreviated (PAHs or PACs). These molecules composed primarily of fused rings of carbon (either neutral or in an ionized state) are said to be the most common class of carbon compound in the galaxy. They are also the most common class of carbon molecule in meteorites and in cometary and asteroidal dust (cosmic dust). These compounds, as well as the amino acids, nucleobases, and many other compounds in meteorites, carry deuterium (H) and isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen that are very rare on earth, attesting to their extraterrestrial origin. The PAHs are thought to form in hot circumstellar environments (around dying carbon rich red giant stars).\n\nThe sparseness of interstellar and interplanetary space results in some unusual chemistry, since symmetry-forbidden reactions cannot occur except on the longest of timescales. For this reason, molecules and molecular ions which are unstable on earth can be highly abundant in space, for example the H ion. Astrochemistry overlaps with astrophysics and nuclear physics in characterizing the nuclear reactions which occur in stars, the consequences for stellar evolution, as well as stellar 'generations'. Indeed, the nuclear reactions in stars produce every naturally occurring chemical element. As the stellar 'generations' advance, the mass of the newly formed elements increases. A first-generation star uses elemental hydrogen (H) as a fuel source and produces helium (He). Hydrogen is the most abundant element, and it is the basic building block for all other elements as its nucleus has only one proton. Gravitational pull toward the center of a star creates massive amounts of heat and pressure, which cause nuclear fusion. Through this process of merging nuclear mass, heavier elements are formed. Lithium, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen are examples of elements that form in stellar fusion. After many stellar generations, very heavy elements are formed (e.g. iron and lead).\n\nTheoretical astronomers use a wide variety of tools which include analytical models (for example, polytropes to approximate the behaviors of a star) and computational numerical simulations. Each has some advantages. Analytical models of a process are generally better for giving insight into the heart of what is going on. Numerical models can reveal the existence of phenomena and effects that would otherwise not be seen.\n\nAstronomy theorists endeavor to create theoretical models and figure out the observational consequences of those models. This helps observers look for data that can refute a model or help in choosing between several alternate or conflicting models.\n\nTheorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data. Consistent with the general scientific approach, in the case of an inconsistency, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model to fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.\n\nTopics studied by theoretical astronomers include:\n\nAstrophysical relativity serves as a tool to gauge the properties of large scale structures for which gravitation plays a significant role in physical phenomena investigated and as the basis for black hole (\"astro\")physics and the study of gravitational waves.\n\nSome widely accepted and studied theories and models in astronomy, now included in the Lambda-CDM model are the Big Bang, Cosmic inflation, dark matter, and fundamental theories of physics.\n\nA few examples of this process:\n\nDark matter and dark energy are the current leading topics in astronomy, as their discovery and controversy originated during the study of the galaxies.\n\nOf the topics approached with the tools of theoretical physics, particular consideration is often given to stellar photospheres, stellar atmospheres, the solar atmosphere, planetary atmospheres, gaseous nebulae, nonstationary stars, and the interstellar medium. Special attention is given to the internal structure of stars.\n\nThe observation of a neutrino burst within 3 h of the associated optical burst from Supernova 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) gave theoretical astrophysicists an opportunity to test that neutrinos and photons follow the same trajectories in the gravitational field of the galaxy.\n\nA general form of the first law of thermodynamics for stationary black holes can be derived from the microcanonical functional integral for the gravitational field. The boundary data\nare the thermodynamical extensive variables, including the energy and angular momentum of the system. For the simpler case of nonrelativistic mechanics as is often observed in astrophysical phenomena associated with a black hole event horizon, the density of states can be expressed as a real-time functional integral and subsequently used to deduce Feynman's imaginary-time functional integral for the canonical partition function.\n\nReaction equations and large reaction networks are an important tool in theoretical astrochemistry, especially as applied to the gas-grain chemistry of the interstellar medium. Theoretical astrochemistry offers the prospect of being able to place constraints on the inventory of organics for exogenous delivery to the early Earth.\n\n\"An important goal for theoretical astrochemistry is to elucidate which organics are of true interstellar origin, and to identify possible interstellar precursors and reaction pathways for those molecules which are the result of aqueous alterations.\" One of the ways this goal can be achieved is through the study of carbonaceous material as found in some meteorites. Carbonaceous chondrites (such as C1 and C2) include organic compounds such as amines and amides; alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones; aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons; sulfonic and phosphonic acids; amino, hydroxycarboxylic, and carboxylic acids; purines and pyrimidines; and kerogen-type material. The organic inventories of primitive meteorites display large and variable enrichments in deuterium, carbon-13 (C), and nitrogen-15 (N), which is indicative of their retention of an interstellar heritage.\n\nThe chemical composition of comets should reflect both the conditions in the outer solar nebula some 4.5 × 10 ayr, and the nature of the natal interstellar cloud from which the Solar system was formed. While comets retain a strong signature of their ultimate interstellar origins, significant processing must have occurred in the protosolar nebula. Early models of coma chemistry showed that reactions can occur rapidly in the inner coma, where the most important reactions are proton transfer reactions. Such reactions can potentially cycle deuterium between the different coma molecules, altering the initial D/H ratios released from the nuclear ice, and necessitating the construction of accurate models of cometary deuterium chemistry, so that gas-phase coma observations can be safely extrapolated to give nuclear D/H ratios.\n\nWhile the lines of conceptual understanding between theoretical astrochemistry and theoretical chemical astronomy often become blurred so that the goals and tools are the same, there are subtle differences between the two sciences. Theoretical chemistry as applied to astronomy seeks to find new ways to observe chemicals in celestial objects, for example. This often leads to theoretical astrochemistry having to seek new ways to describe or explain those same observations.\n\nThe new era of chemical astronomy had to await the clear enunciation of the chemical principles of spectroscopy and the applicable theory.\n\nSupernova radioactivity dominates light curves and the chemistry of dust condensation is also dominated by radioactivity. Dust is usually either carbon or oxides depending on which is more abundant, but Compton electrons dissociate the CO molecule in about one month. The new chemical astronomy of supernova solids depends on the supernova radioactivity:\n\nLike theoretical chemical astronomy, the lines of conceptual understanding between theoretical astrophysics and theoretical physical astronomy are often blurred, but, again, there are subtle differences between these two sciences. Theoretical physics as applied to astronomy seeks to find new ways to observe physical phenomena in celestial objects and what to look for, for example. This often leads to theoretical astrophysics having to seek new ways to describe or explain those same observations, with hopefully a convergence to improve our understanding of the local environment of Earth and the physical Universe.\n\nNuclear matrix elements of relevant operators as extracted from data and from a shell-model and theoretical approximations both for the two-neutrino and neutrinoless modes of decay are used to explain the weak interaction and nuclear structure aspects of nuclear double beta decay.\n\nNew neutron-rich isotopes, Ne, Na, and Si have been produced unambiguously for the first time, and convincing evidence for the particle instability of three others, Ne, Na, and Mg has been obtained. These experimental findings compare with recent theoretical predictions.\n\nUntil recently all the time units that appear natural to us are caused by astronomical phenomena:\n\nHigh precision appears problematic:\n\nSome of these time scales are sidereal time, solar time, and universal time.\n\nFrom the Systeme Internationale (SI) comes the second as defined by the duration of 9 192 631 770 cycles of a particular hyperfine structure transition in the ground state of caesium-133 (Cs). For practical usability a device is required that attempts to produce the SI second (s) such as an atomic clock. But not all such clocks agree. The weighted mean of many clocks distributed over the whole Earth defines the Temps Atomique International; i.e., the Atomic Time TAI. From the General theory of relativity the time measured depends on the altitude on earth and the spatial velocity of the clock so that TAI refers to a location on sea level that rotates with the Earth.\n\nSince the Earth's rotation is irregular, any time scale derived from it such as Greenwich Mean Time led to recurring problems in predicting the Ephemerides for the positions of the Moon, Sun, planets and their natural satellites. In 1976 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) resolved that the theoretical basis for ephemeris time (ET) was wholly non-relativistic, and therefore, beginning in 1984 ephemeris time would be replaced by two further time scales with allowance for relativistic corrections. Their names, assigned in 1979, emphasized their dynamical nature or origin, Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) and Terrestrial Dynamical Time (TDT). Both were defined for continuity with ET and were based on what had become the standard SI second, which in turn had been derived from the measured second of ET.\n\nDuring the period 1991–2006, the TDB and TDT time scales were both redefined and replaced, owing to difficulties or inconsistencies in their original definitions. The current fundamental relativistic time scales are Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG) and Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCB). Both of these have rates that are based on the SI second in respective reference frames (and hypothetically outside the relevant gravity well), but due to relativistic effects, their rates would appear slightly faster when observed at the Earth's surface, and therefore diverge from local Earth-based time scales using the SI second at the Earth's surface.\n\nThe currently defined IAU time scales also include Terrestrial Time (TT) (replacing TDT, and now defined as a re-scaling of TCG, chosen to give TT a rate that matches the SI second when observed at the Earth's surface), and a redefined Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB), a re-scaling of TCB to give TDB a rate that matches the SI second at the Earth's surface.\n\nFor a star, the dynamical time scale is defined as the time that would be taken for a test particle released at the surface to fall under the star's potential to the centre point, if pressure forces were negligible. In other words, the dynamical time scale measures the amount of time it would take a certain star to collapse in the absence of any internal pressure. By appropriate manipulation of the equations of stellar structure this can be found to be\n\nformula_1\n\nwhere R is the radius of the star, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the star and v is the escape velocity. As an example, the Sun dynamical time scale is approximately 1133 seconds. Note that the actual time it would take a star like the Sun to collapse is greater because internal pressure is present.\n\nThe 'fundamental' oscillatory mode of a star will be at approximately the dynamical time scale. Oscillations at this frequency are seen in Cepheid variables.\n\nThe basic characteristics of applied astronomical navigation are\n\nThe superiority of satellite navigation systems to astronomical navigation are currently undeniable, especially with the development and use of GPS/NAVSTAR.

The network also supports selected Earth-orbiting missions. DSN is part of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).\n\nAn observer becomes a deep space explorer upon escaping Earth's orbit. While the Deep Space Network maintains communication and enables data download from an exploratory vessel, any local probing performed by sensors or active systems aboard usually require astronomical navigation, since the enclosing network of satellites to ensure accurate positioning is absent.\n\n\n"}

She was born Valentine Marie Augustine Gross, only daughter to Auguste Gross and Zélie Démelin, in Boulogne-sur-Mer. She is best known for her work with the Russian ballet and with the French Surrealists. Hugo died in Paris.\n\nA lover of the theater and music, Hugo's father raised her to share his interests until his death in 1903, which was undetermined as suicide or an accident. After her husband's death, Zélie raised her daughter alone.\n\nValentine Hugo received schooling in Boulogne-sur-Mer, where she received multiple awards for accomplishments in drawing, until 1907, at which time she entered the L'École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. There she worked in the studio at the Académie Humbert and exhibited in the Salon of French artists in 1909, and again in 1911. In 1908, Valentine Hugo met the artist Edmond Aman-Jean, who painted her portrait in 1909 and encouraged Hugo's artistic pursuits.\n\nHugo's work with the Ballets Russes established her connection with Jean Cocteau, who would introduce her to several important figures in her life, including her future husband French artist Jean Hugo (1894–1984), great-grandson of Victor Hugo. She would collaborate with him on ballet designs including \"Les mariés de la tour Eiffel\" (1921), and in 1926 she executed 24 wood engravings after maquettes by Jean Hugo for Jean Cocteau's production of \"Roméo et Juliette\". Her involvement with the ballets provided Hugo many opportunities to progress her artwork. She often drew sketches of the ballets' choreography, and had a particular fascination with dancer and choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky. In 1913 she exhibited her paintings at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées during the premiere of \"The Rite of Spring\".\n\nHugo and Cocteau collaborated to create the ballet \"Parade\", which premiered on 18 May 1917. Hugo worked on several other of Satie's ballets, including \"Le Piège de Méduse\", \"Socrate,\" and \"Mercure\".\n\nHugo hosted salons with many artists, writers, and musicians in Paris, including avant-garde leaders such as Pablo Picasso, André Breton, and Paul Éluard. She would often sketch her visitors, foreshadowing her portraiture work of the Surrealist leaders later on.\n\nHugo met Breton in 1917, before the start of Surrealism, at one of Cocteau's readings. Her friendships with Breton and Eluard would keep her connected to the Surrealists as the movement developed, and help her to form connections with other members, such as Salvador Dalí and Max Ernst. The three often traveled together, along with other members of the movement, in 1931 and 1932. As the only member of the group who owned a vehicle, Hugo would drive her companions to their destinations.\n\nValentine and Jean began living apart in 1926, and eventually divorced in 1932. Her separation from her husband allowed Hugo greater freedom to be involved with the Surrealist group. She moved into the same building as Eluard and Breton in May 1932.\n\nHugo joined the Bureau of Surrealist Research and created the \"Objet à fonctionnement symbolique\" (1931), which was shown during the Exposition surréalistic in 1933. She took part in other exhibitions throughout her time with the group, including an exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in 1936.\n\nHugo participated in the exquisite corpse game practiced by the Surrealists, collaborating on drawings with Breton, Eluard, and many others. These drawings have an illusionist quality credited to Hugo's participation. She introduced new mediums to the practice, as the drawings she participated in used gouache on black paper.\n\nHugo's relationship with Breton turned physical for a brief period between approximately July 1931 and May 1932. It was a tumultuous affair, and ended negatively for Hugo. On 8 May 1932, following a fight with Breton, Hugo attempted suicide. Regretting her actions, she called Eluard with enough time for him to arrive and save her life. Following this event, Breton and Hugo's friendship remained strained until 9 September of that year, when Hugo punched Breton. Their association permanently ended at this point, except for interactions during group meetings of the Surrealists. Breton never mentioned Hugo in his book \"Le Surréalisme et la Peinture\".\n\nIn 1943, Hugo's work was included in Peggy Guggenheim's show \"Exhibition by 31 Women\" at the Art of This Century gallery in New York. After the war, she went back to stage design for choreography, while continuing to create her paintings \"in secret,\" saving \"the haunting element of surprise and chance for the end.\" In 1948, she completed the portrait of Picasso she had started in 1934.\n\nHugo died on 16 March 1968, the date of her 81st birthday.\n\nHugo was primarily known for her drawings, where a fine line against a dark background created and abundance of decorative volutes and superimposed elements. Her portraits of the leading surrealists and her illustrations for texts by Rene Char and Paul Eluard and for the edition of Achim von Arnim's \"Strange Tales\" prefaced by Breton in 1933 are particularly interesting. The foremost illustrator of Paul Éluard's work, she first exhibited with the surrealists in the Salon des Surindépendants of 1933.\n\nSeveral of her illustrations are:\n\nA retrospective exhibition of her work was held at the Centre Culturel Thibaud de Champagne, Troyes, in 1977.\n\nOther exhibitions of her work have been at: Tenerife (1935), Copenhagen (1935), New York (1937), Tokyo (1937).\n\n"}

Alexa Fluor dyes are frequently used as cell and tissue labels in fluorescence microscopy and cell biology. Alexa Fluor dyes can be conjugated directly to primary antibodies or to secondary antibodies to amplify signal and sensitivity or other biomolecules.\n\nThe excitation and emission spectra of the Alexa Fluor series cover the visible spectrum and extend into the infrared. The individual members of the family are numbered according roughly to their excitation maxima in nanometers.\n\nRichard and Rosaria Haugland, the founders of Molecular Probes, are well known in biology and chemistry for their research into fluorescent dyes useful in biological research applications. At the time that Molecular Probes was founded, such products were largely unavailable commercially. A number of fluorescent dyes that are now widely used were discovered and developed in the laboratories of Molecular Probes.—dyes such as Texas Red, Cascade Blue, Oregon Green, Marina Blue, and the Alexa Fluor family. The most famous of these, the Alexa Fluor family of dyes, were designed to improve upon properties of previously developed biological fluorescent dye families, and solve some of the issues that they possessed. The Alexa Fluor dyes were named after Alex Haugland, son of Richard and Rosaria Haugland.\n\nMolecular Probes was acquired in 2003 by Invitrogen, who worked to further expand the Alexa Fluor family by addion of new dyes to fill gaps not covered in the emission spectrum. In 2008, Invitrogen and the Alexa Fluor product line became a part of the Life Technologies, after the Invitrogen merger with Applied Biosystems. In 2014, Life Technologies was acquired by Thermo Fisher Scientific, who revitalized the Invitrogen name and brand, bringing the Alexa Fluor product line back under it.\n\nThe Alexa Fluor dyes were chemically synthesized through sulfonation and additional chemical modifications made to the well known families of coumarin, rhodamine, and cyanine dyes, and to the xanthene family (of which the fluorescein, an industry-standard, is a part). Sulfonation made the product Alexa Fluor dyes negatively charged and thus more hydrophilic and soluble than their parent dyes; the additional modifications were aimed to improve dye performance in other areas. For example, Alexa Fluor 488, a sulfonated and otherwise chemically modified form of fluorescein, was designed to solve the well known issues of rapid photobleaching and pH-dependent fluorescent intensity characteristic of the dye fluorescein isothiocyanate. \n\nThe Alexa Fluor series dyes are less pH-sensitive and more photostable than the original dyes (fluorescein, rhodamine, etc.) from which they were synthesized. While extinction coefficients of each member of this line of dyes are known (see table), quantum yields and life times are not. Brightness comparisons are also generally favorable. \n\nOther provide alternatives to individual members of the line of Alexa Fluor Dyes. Comparisons with other dyes are less consistent, and also even more \"delicate\", depending on the conditions and techniques used. Such comparisons should be considered, depending on the conditions and techniques used, and the dye performance (signal, background, stability) needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was written by members George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley.\n\nClub Tropicana was written in 1981 in Andrew's living room, before the band or bandname had been fully established, and was the second Wham! song they came up with after the initial Wham Rap! Although only half finished at the time of recording, it became one of the three home demos hastily made on a hired porta-studio which led to their first record contract with Innervision Records. The initial song inspiration came from their excitement over the glamour and escapism of the then burgeoning New Romantic club scene, and George, Andrew and Shirlie's occasional visits to one such club in London, Le Beat Route. The song's lyrical theme was then expanded to also include the hedonism of summery Club 18-30 holidays, whilst musically fusing a Latin jazz rhythm with a groove inspired by The Gap Band's \"Burn Rubber on Me\".\n\nThe song was a mild departure from Wham!'s previous singles, which had all been motivated by social or political issues. \"Club Tropicana\", however, was a satire of the boom for cheap package holidays for younger, single people of a hedonistic nature. It was specifically seen in the UK as a swipe at the very popular Club 18-30 scheme.\n\nThe song was released in July 1983 and peaked at no.4 in the UK, going on to become the 39th best selling single of 1983. It was the fourth and final single to be taken from the album \"Fantastic\". Wham! then achieved four UK no.1 singles before splitting at their height in 1986.\n\nThe song was also included on the compilation album \"The Final\" and on Michael's greatest hits album \"Twenty Five\".\n\nThe B-side, \"Blue (Armed With Love)\", is a semi-instrumental dub track. During their \"Club Fantastic\" tour in late 1983 and in 1985 in China, they performed this song live, complete with sung verses. This version was released as \"Blue (Live In China)\" on their 1986 LP \"Music from the Edge of Heaven\" as well as the B-side of 1985's single release of \"Last Christmas.\" The studio vocal version of the song has never been released.\n\nA video directed by Duncan Gibbins was made at Pikes Hotel in Ibiza, with scenes of George and Andrew on the beach, making eyes at bikini-clad girls played by their backing singers Dee C. Lee and Shirlie Holliman. They are also seen relaxing by a pool and sipping cocktails, along with the famous scene of trumpet-playing taking place in the pool itself. A twist in the sexual tension between the two men and two women is revealed at the end, when it turns out that Michael and Ridgeley are airline pilots and Dee and Shirlie are stewardesses.\n\nIt was during this trip to Ibiza that George had his first physical homosexual encounter, confirming to himself that he was definitely either gay or bisexual. He confided at first in Shirlie whilst still on the trip, who reassured him that Andrew would be ok with it. The morning after the video shoot finished, George called Andrew to join him and Shirlie in his room at Pike's, and came out to him. Andrew was initially surprised, but ultimately OK with it.\n\nAs of May 2020, the music video has received 24 million views on YouTube.\n"}

At the age of ten, he entered the minor seminary Franciscan Custody of Terra Santa (CTS). He was ordained a priest in Bethlehem in 1942. From 1946 to 1949 he studied at the Pontifical Oriental Institute in Rome, where he obtained a doctorate in Oriental Science. (His thesis, \"The excavations of Kh. Siyar El-Ghanam (Shepherd's Field) and the surrounding monasteries\", was published in 1955.) \n\nCorbo began teaching, first at the Franciscan minor seminary in Al-Qubeiba, and from 1950 to 1968 at the major Franciscan seminary in Jerusalem. While at Al-Qubeiba, he became interested in the work of archaeologist and fellow Franciscan Bellarmino Bagatti, and made some experimental excavations in the village. In expanding his investigations to other monastic ruins, and through literary sources was able to identify the monastery of St. Theodore at Bir el Qutt. Here he discovered the oldest extant Georgian inscriptions yet found. These give an important look into the every day life of the early monks. In October 1987, on a visit to Jerusalem, Ilia II of Georgia, Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia presented Corbo with a commemorative coin celebrating 1500 years of the Evangelization of Georgia for helping to increase awareness of the Georgian monastic tradition in the Holy Land.\n\nHe will be remembered for excavating many important holy places. Father Corbo was responsible for organizing the Terra Sancta pavilion at the exhibition of missionary art for the 1950 Holy Year. This resulted in the publication of \"Sacred art in the Holy Places\". From 1950 to 1955, Corbo was director of the magazine \"La Terra Santa\", and in 1951 was put in charge of the restoration of a number of shrines administered by CTS. In this he worked with architect Antonio Barluzzi. One of the buildings restored was the Chapel of the Shepherd's Field, another was the Church of Saint John the Baptist, Ein Karem. From 1956 to 1959, he was custos of the friary at Gethsemane.\n\nIn 1962 Corbo and Stanislao Loffreda, from the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum of Jerusalem, began archaeological excavation of the Herodium. Work continued until 1967: they discovered the upper citadel, at the top of the hill. \n\nCorbo also excavated the interior of the Byzantine basilica on Mount Nebo. In 1963, he was put in charge of restoring the original pavements for exhibition. In the modern chapel presbytery, built to protect the site and provide worship space, remnants of mosaic floors from different periods can be seen.\n\nIn 1968 Corbo and Loffreda began work at Capharnaum. Between 1971 and 1977 they began work at Magdala. From 1978 to 1981, they carried out excavations were carried out at Machaerus. Corbo's group was the first to prove that the castle of Machaerus was definitely one of the mosaic-decorated fortified palaces of King Herod the Great.\n\nHis name will be especially tied to two sacred places: the Holy Sepulcher and Capharnaum, the \"city of Jesus\".\n\nHe is remembered for the excavations of many religious sites: \n\nCorbo died in Capharnaum on December 6, 1991.\n"}
{"id": "2039186", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2039186", "title": "Cuttyhunk Island", "text": "Cuttyhunk Island\n\nCuttyhunk Island is the outermost of the Elizabeth Islands in Massachusetts. A small outpost for the harvesting of sassafras was occupied for a few weeks in 1602, arguably making it the first English settlement in New England. Cuttyhunk is located between Buzzards Bay to the north and Vineyard Sound to the south. Penikese Island and Nashawena Island are located to the north and east respectively.\n\nThe island has a land area of , and a population of 52 persons as of the 2000 census. It is the fourth largest in area of the Elizabeth Islands and home to the village of Cuttyhunk. It lies entirely within the town of Gosnold.\n\nCuttyhunk is about a mile and a half long, and three-quarters of a mile wide, with a large natural harbor at the eastern end of the island. Fully half of the main part of the island is set apart as a nature preserve. It is home to a wide variety of birds such as piping plovers, least terns and Massachusetts' American oystercatchers, as well as White-tailed deer, White-footed mice, and Eastern cottontails. It also has a small population of coyotes. Cuttyhunk has most varieties of New England's wildflowers, as well as bayberry, sweet peas, and a host of other plant life.\n\nTwo large peninsular arms extend from the main body of the island, named Canapitsit (the southern arm) and Copicut Neck (the northern arm). The shore is made up largely of rocks, testimony to Cuttyhunk's glacial origins. Cuttyhunk is covered with rocks and stones that are elsewhere found only in the mountains of Vermont and New Hampshire.\n\nThere are three stretches of sandy beach: along the channel that leads to the harbor (Channel Beach), around the sunken barges that connect Canapitsit to the main body of land (Barges Beach), and at \"Church's beach,\" which connects Copicut to the main island. Much of Cuttyhunk's rocky shore is bounded by steep cliffs made of rock, sand, and clay. The western end of the island is taken up by the West End Pond, much of which is currently used for shellfish farming. A monument to Bartholomew Gosnold's 1602 landing stands on a small island in the Pond.\n\nThe highest point on the island is Lookout Hill, standing at above sea level. The Lookout is home to one of the six (one now buried) defensive bunkers built by the United States Coast Guard in 1941 to watch the surrounding ocean for Nazi U-boats. Stripped of their observation equipment and weaponry at the end of World War II, the bunkers are now picnic areas. They offer views of the island and its surrounding waters. The Coast Guard station has not been active since 1964.\n\nCuttyhunk has been a popular site for large striped bass. In 1913, Charles Church caught a world-record striped bass that weighed 73 pounds. That record lasted many years. Charles Cinto duplicated the effort, landing a 73-pound striped bass near Cuttyhunk in 1967. Cuttyhunk has been the home port to many notable fishing guides. Many of these guides troll secret lures attached by stainless-steel or nickel-alloy wire along the rocky reefs near the island where large female striped bass reside from the spring through the autumn. The most notable reef, Sow and Pigs Reef, was where Mr. Cinto caught his striped bass.\n\nThe island was originally named \"Poocuohhunkkunnah\" (probably from the Wampanoag for \"Point of departure\" or \"Land's end\") by the native Wampanoag tribe. In 1602 English explorer Bartholomew Gosnold renamed the island. On March 6, 1602, Gosnold set out aboard the barque \"The Concord\" from Falmouth, England to plant a colony in the New World of America. Gosnold and his men landed near Kennebunkport, Maine, then explored Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, and Cuttyhunk. They established a modest fort on Cuttyhunk where they planned to harvest sassafras, a valuable commodity in Europe at the time. After exploring the islands for less than a month, the men returned with \"The Concord\" to England.\n\nIn 1606 the King granted the Elizabeth Islands to the Council of New England, which dissolved in 1635. After this, they became the property of William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling. Sterling sold the islands to Thomas Mayhew in 1641, and in 1663 James Stuart, Duke of York assumed proprietorship over them.\n\nIn 1668, Mayhew sold Cuttyhunk to Philip Smith, Peleg Sanford, and Thomas Ward of Newport, Rhode Island. In 1688, Peleg Sanford acquired his partners' rights in the island, and sold half of it to Ralph Earle of Dartmouth. He in turn immediately sold his property to his son, Ralph Jr., who became the island's first permanent English settler. He and other colonists harvested the island of all of its timber, leaving it bare and wind-swept.\n\nIn 1693, Peleg Slocum purchased all of the holdings on Cuttyhunk, and became its sole owner. The Slocum family continued to live on Cuttyhunk for the next two hundred years. Several generations were slaveholders of Africans transported to the English colony for labor.\n\nIn 1858, William C.N. Swift, Thomas Nye, and Eben Perry bought Cuttyhunk from Otis Slocum for fifty dollars. In 1864, the town of Gosnold was finally incorporated.\n\n\n\nIn 1864 some members of The West Island Club in Sakonnet Point, Rhode Island grew dissatisfied with that club's regulations. They looked for a place to start their own fishing club. After a visit to Cuttyhunk, these powerful New York gentlemen decided they had found their spot. In 1865, they purchased a large portion of the island, and built 26 \"fishing stands\"—long, wooden platforms that stretched out from rock to rock into the surf—all around the island. They limited initial membership to fifty men, with a single negative vote of the active members sufficient to bar a man from membership. The admission fee was $300. Eventually, the membership was expanded to sixty, then seventy-five.\n\nEach evening, the members of the Club met to draw lots to determine which fishing stand each would use the next day. Each member employed a \"chummer\"—a young boy paid to bait the member's hook with lobster tail, and cast chunks of lobster into the surf to attract striped bass. They paid the chummer $1 per fish caught, or more if the fish were particularly large. Records were kept of the number, size, and location of the fish caught, and by whom. Cuttyhunk gained a reputation for being a prime location for sportfishing, especially for striped bass.\n\nThe Cuttyhunk Club gave the Cuttyhunk Church the land to build on in 1880 (the Church celebrated its 125th anniversary in the summer of 2006). Every Fourth of July, the Club would host a party for island residents, including fireworks displays. In 1921, William M. Wood bought out the Cuttyhunk Club's interest in the island, along with any other land that was for sale. He wanted a place for his young children to summer. He invited other young, wealthy couples who were his friends to purchase summer homes on the island, to provide playmates for his children. The Wood family owns a great deal of the island to this day. Descendants of many of the families who purchased property from Wood still summer on the island annually.\n\nThe treacherous waters of the Vineyard Sound and Buzzards Bay were tricky for novices to navigate. Early on in the island's history, island men began to make a large part of their living piloting boats past the dangerous reefs and towards the ports of New Bedford, Providence, and Boston. Men stood atop Lookout Hill with spyglasses in hand, scanning the horizon for incoming whaling ships headed for New Bedford. When a ship appeared, the men would scramble down to the shore to their boats in a race to be the first to offer services as a pilot. In 1903, Cuttyhunk pilots guided as many as eleven ships a day to New Bedford harbor. The reefs were indeed dangerous. In 1847 the Massachusetts Humane Society established life-saving stations throughout the Elizabeth Islands, supplied with items needed by islanders to assist boats in trouble.\n\nThe lighthouse was decommissioned and torn down in 1947, replaced by a skeleton tower. The keeper's house was also destroyed. This tower continues to exhibit a white flashing light, visible for , from above sea level. The only surviving structure from the lighthouse station is a stone oil house, and its door and roof are missing.\n\n\nCuttyhunk is part of the town of Gosnold, Massachusetts and home to 10 year-round residents. The town's population swells to about 400 in the summer with vacationers and boaters. Summer residents and visitors enjoy the island's beaches and natural beauty, but most of all its quiet and solitude. Cuttyhunk has a few trucks, but most people travel on foot or by golf cart. Cuttyhunk's natural harbor is a popular spot for boaters to tie up for a night or even a summer.\n\nCuttyhunk continues to be a popular site for sportfishing, with striped bass and bluefish being the most frequent catches. Lobstering is an occupation for a few of the island's residents, as is boat building, shellfishing, and carpentry. The island is served by a ferry named the \"M/V Cuttyhunk\", which makes frequent trips to Cuttyhunk from New Bedford during the summer.\n\nThere are several bed and breakfasts and home rentals for summer tourists, but given its small size, other facilities on the island are limited, with three retail stores and only a few spots for lunch or dinner.\n\nThe single school on the island had one teacher and three students as of August 2009; in June 2019, its final student, eighth grader Gwen Lynch, graduated as the sole member of the class of 2019. The school has plans to reopen as a STEAM Academy, which would offer weeklong seminar-style programs in lieu of having full-time students on-island.\n\n\n\n"}

It is technically considered either a non-centrifugal cane sugar or a centrifuged, partially refined sugar according to the process used by the manufacturer. Muscovado contains higher levels of various minerals than processed white sugar, and is considered by some to be healthier. Its main uses are in food and confectionery, and the manufacture of rum and other forms of alcohol. The largest producer and consumer of muscovado is India.\n\nThe English name \"muscovado\" is derived from a corruption of Portuguese ' and Spanish ' (unrefined sugar). The Indian English names for this type of sugar are \"khandsari\" and \"khand\" (sometimes spelled \"khaand\").\n\nThere is no legal definition of muscovado, and no international standards for it such as \"Codex Alimentarius\" or \"Protected Designation of Origin\". This has led to manufacturers calling various sugar products \"muscovado\", and has led to confusion between muscovado and brown sugar, and even with jaggery.\n\nThe earliest known production of crystalline sugar began in northern India, after the introduction of sugarcane by Austronesian traders from Island Southeast Asia at around 1000 BCE. However, the exact date of the first cane sugar production is unclear. The earliest evidence of sugar production comes from ancient Sanskrit and Pali texts. Around the 8th century, Muslim and Arab traders introduced sugar from medieval India to the other parts of the Abbasid Caliphate in the Mediterranean, Mesopotamia, Egypt, North Africa, and Andalusia. By the 10th century, sources state that every village in Mesopotamia grew sugarcane.\n\nSugar production was an important trade in the British Empire. Sugarcane was produced in British colonies in the West Indies, India, Mauritius and Fiji, and in other territories including Cuba, the French West Indies, Java, Brazil, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Réunion and Louisiana. Sugarcane production often involved slavery or exploitative indentured servitude. Raw sugar was shipped to Europe or to New England where it was refined or distilled into rum, much of which was re-exported at higher prices. Sugar refineries were also established in Bihar, in eastern India.\n\nRaw sugar was brought to port in a variety of purities that could be sold either as raw sugar direct to market for making alcohol, or as muscovado exported sugar refineries such as those in Glasgow or London. In the British Empire, raw sugars that had been refined enough to lose most of the molasses content were termed raw and deemed higher quality, while poor quality sugars with a high molasses content were referred to as muscovado, though the term \"brown sugar\" was sometimes used interchangeably.\n\nMuscovado is made from the juice of sugar cane that is evaporated until crystallisation occurs. The viscous suspension of crystals and mother liquor (molasses) is called massecuite. In the 19th century several techniques were used for sugar production. Muscovado is today produced by three main methods:\n\nMassecuite is also used in the production of jaggery, in which it is set into moulds directly.\n\nTotal global production is 10 to 11 million tons annually by 20 nations. The largest producer is India (58%), followed by Colombia (14%), Myanmar (9%), Pakistan (6%), Brazil (4%), Bangladesh (3%) and China (3%).\n\nIn India, most khand (muscovado) is produced by 150 small to medium scale private manufacturers overseen by the Khadi and Village Industries Commission. These producers use traditional chemical-free organic manual shearing methods, each operating between 100 and 120 days per year with a typical capacity of between 200 and 350 tons of sugar cane per day. The largest producing states in India are Maharashtra (58%), Bihar (6%), Karnataka (5%), Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh (6%).\n\nIn Mauritius muscovado is produced by centrifuging massecuite, from which the molasses is left to drain naturally.\n\nIn the Philippines muscovado may be generated by any of the three methods. In the past, muscovado was one of the prominent export commodities of the Philippines, especially from the Negros region from the 19th century until the late 1970s.\n\nThe production of muscovado in the Philippines, Barbados, and elsewhere had experienced a long period of decline when large mills took over sugar production from small farmers with small mills. In recent years an increased consumer interest in healthy and organic foods has revived interest in muscovado, creating a new market for small mills.\n\nWhen produced under regulated conditions muscovado is nutritionally richer than sugars, and retains more of the natural minerals in sugar cane juice, as shown in the following nutritional analysis (per 100 g):\n\nMuscovado is used as an ingredient in food and confectionery, and as a sweetener in hot beverages. It is very dark brown and is slightly coarser and stickier than most brown sugars. Muscovado takes its flavor and color from its source, sugarcane juice. It offers good resistance to high temperatures and has a reasonably long shelf life.\n\nMuscovado sugar can be substituted for brown sugar in most recipes by slightly reducing the liquid content of the recipe.\n\nThe use of \"khand\" in India in making sweets has been traced to at least 500 BC, when both raw and refined sugar were used.\n\nAlong with gur, \"khandsari\" unrefined sugar is India's traditional sweetener, commonly used in traditional recipes for masala chai (spiced Indian tea), eating with roti by mixing with melted ghee, traditional Indian sweets that require sugar such as kheer (Indian rice pudding), gur or khand chawal (sweetened rice) or laddu.\n\nMuscovado is often used to sweeten coffee.\n\nA significant proportion of India's production of Khandsari (muscovado) is used for the illicit production of desi daru, a distilled alcoholic drink.\n\nKhandsari (muscovado) is used in traditional Ayurveda medicine to aid blood purification, digestion, bone health and the lungs.\n\n"}

{"id": "2039275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2039275", "title": "Mayo Smith", "text": "Mayo Smith\n\nEdward Mayo \"Catfish\" Smith (January 17, 1915 – November 24, 1977) was an American professional baseball player, manager, and scout, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Athletics. Smith had a 39-year baseball career from to . He is also the namesake of the \"Mayo Smith Society\", the Detroit Tigers international fan club that awards the \"King Tiger Award,\" each year.\n\nSmith served as the manager of the Philadelphia Phillies (–), Cincinnati Reds (), and Detroit Tigers (–), compiling a managerial record of 662–612 (). He received The Sporting News Manager of the Year Award in after the Tigers won the American League (AL) pennant by 12 games with a record of 103–59 () and defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1968 World Series. ESPN has ranked Smith's decision to move Mickey Stanley to shortstop for the 1968 World Series as the third \"gutsiest call\" in sports history.\n\nSmith also played professional baseball for 18 seasons from 1933 to , including one season in MLB, with the 1945 Philadelphia Athletics. He spent his most productive years in the International League playing for the Toronto Maple Leafs (–) and Buffalo Bisons (–) and in the Pacific Coast League with the Portland Beavers (–). Smith also spent 13 years in the New York Yankees organization as a minor league manager from to and as a \"super scout\" and \"trouble shooter\" from to .\n\nSmith was born in January 17, 1915 at New London, Missouri, a small town located 10 miles south of Hannibal and 100 miles northwest of St. Louis. He was the only child of George Frederick Smith and Eval Smith. His middle name, \"Mayo\", was reportedly bestowed by his grandmother, who had been a patient at the Mayo Clinic and \"liked the name.\" In 1920, the family lived in Saverton Township, Ralls County, Missouri, where George Frederick was a farmer.\n\nIn 1926, at age 11, Smith moved with his family to Lake Worth in Palm Beach County, Florida. In Florida, Smith's father was employed as a butcher or \"meat cutter\" in a meat market, and his mother was employed as a sales lady in a \"dry goods\" store.\n\nSmith attended Lake Worth High School where he was the captain of the football and basketball teams and the class president in his sophomore and senior years. He graduated from high school in 1932 and was selected as the \"outstanding boy student\" in Palm Beach County.\n\nBecause Smith's high school did not have a baseball team, he played as a third baseman for a semi-pro Elks team in the Palm Beach County League. According to another source, Smith was a member of the Carl Vogel Post 47, Junior Legion All-Stars in 1929. In any event, Smith was forced to stop playing semi-pro baseball after school officials threatened to expel him if he continued.\n\nSmith was also an outstanding golfer and billiards player, playing professional billiards at age 16. He played in several exhibitions against Ralph Greenleaf and William Hoppe, the billiards champions of the 1920s and 1930s. During his youth, he reportedly picked up extra cash as a pool hustler. While playing professional baseball in Buffalo in the 1940s, a local radio broadcaster challenged Smith to a game of billiards. On his first turn, Smith \"broke up the rack and ran 28 points.\"\n\nIn 1933, at age 18, Smith signed with the Double-A Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League. He was discovered by Toronto manager Dan Howley, who spent his winters in Palm Beach. Howley assigned Sam Rice, a veteran outfielder and future Baseball Hall of Fame inductee, to train Smith as an outfielder. Smith recalled, \"After that, I was more an outfielder than third baseman.\" Smith managed only three hits in 29 at bats for Toronto during the 1933 season.\n\nIn 1934, Smith was assigned to the Class B Wilmington Pirates of the Piedmont League. He played the entire 1934 season for Wilmington, though he was called up by the Maple Leafs in September 1934.\n\nIn 1935, Smith appeared briefly with the Maple Leafs, having two hits in 11 at bats. He spent most of the 1935 season with Wilmington. He compiled a .315 batting average with 102 total bases in 254 at bats at Wilmington, but his 1935 season was cut short by illness.\n\nIn February 1936, Smith reported to the Maple Leafs' training camp in Haines City, Florida, making his fourth attempt to win a full-time berth with the team. He did not make the roster and was sent back to the Piedmont League for the 1936 season. The Wilmington Pirates had moved to Durham, North Carolina, and Smith thus spent the 1936 season with the Durham Bulls, batting .217 in 66 games.\n\nIn the spring of 1937, at age 22, Smith finally earned a full-time spot on the Maple Leafs' roster. He became one of the team's starting outfielders and performed well until injuring his leg. At the end of the 1937 season, \"The Sporting News\" praised his performance: \"The outfield, one of the best in the league last season, needs little improvement. Mayo Smith came along in great style and should be ready for a fine season in 1938. He was hitting the ball and making great defensive plays when, unfortunately, a leg injury took him out of the line-up for several weeks.\"\n\nHe continued as a starting outfielder for the Maple Leafs in 1938 and 1939. In 1939, he played on a Maple Leafs team that included future Baseball Hall of Fame inductees Heinie Manush and Tony Lazzeri. Smith compiled a .286 batting average in 1939, 45 points higher than Manush and 59 points higher than Lazzeri. During the 1939 season, Smith also had 196 total bases in 148 games and a career-high 385 putouts and 13 assists. In July 1939, \"The Sporting News\" described Smith as \"the most improved player of the season\" and reported that his \"defensive work is nothing short of sensational.\"\n\nIn December 1939, Smith was traded by the Maple Leafs to the Buffalo Bisons, the Detroit Tigers farm team in the International League, in exchange for outfielder Johnnie Tyler. Buffalo manager Steve O'Neill later called the trade \"the best deal I made in my three years in Buffalo and one of the best of my career.\" Smith played five seasons, principally as a center fielder, with the Bisons from 1940 to 1944. In 1998, 54 years after he concluded his playing career with the Bisons, Smith was posthumously inducted into the Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nPromptly upon joining the Bisons, Smith impressed observers with his defensive play. In April 1940, during a Florida exhibition game against the Detroit Tigers, Smith made a catch that Buffalo sports writer Cy Kritzer later called the greatest catch he had ever seen, including \"The Catch\" made by Willie Mays in 1954. With the bases loaded in the ninth inning, Hank Greenberg hit the ball better than 475 feet into dead center. According to Kritzer, \"Smith turned his back to home plate and dashed straight for the fence. No one gave him a chance to catch the ball. But in the last stride, he leaped and the ball stuck in the web.\" Bucky Harris, who managed Smith in Buffalo, later said, \"My idea of a perfect game would be to have the opposition hit 27 balls into center field . . . with Mayo Smith out there.\"\n\nIn 1941, Smith hit a walk-off, three-run home run with two out in the bottom of the tenth inning. The Bisons' business manager John Stiglmeier leaped over the rail from his box and ran onto the field to slap Smith on the back when he completed his home-run trot. Smith noted that the slap \"actually knocked the wind clean plumb out of me.\"\n\nOn March 25, 1942, 600 residents of Smith's home town of Lake Worth, Florida celebrated \"Mayo Smith Day.\" The Bisons played a spring training game in Lake Worth that day. In a 2-1 loss to the Columbus Red Birds, Smith drove in the Bisons' only run with a single in the eighth inning. Smith went on to have one of his most successful seasons in 1942. He appeared in a career-high 154 games, hit 11 home runs, and compiled a .279 batting average and a .386 on-base percentage. Playing principally in center field, he also had 384 putouts and 13 assists.\n\nAfter playing in every game for the Bisons in 1942, Smith suffered an injury at the end of spring training in 1943. Smith returned to the line-up and appeared in 136 games in the outfield. However, he suffered sustained trouble with the arches in his feet throughout the 1943 season, leading some to speculate that he was \"washed up.\" Smith attributed the trouble to a job working 12 hours a day on cement floors in a war plant during the 1942–43 off-season. After the 1943 season, Smith tried to stay off his feet as much as possible and soaked his feet each night in solutions prepared by the Buffalo trainer. His wife, Louise, told a reporter, \"Mayo eats all his meals with his feet in a tub of water.\"\n\nIn 1944, Smith rebounded from his injuries and had his best season in professional baseball. In May and June 1944, he had separate streaks in which he reached base in 14 and 13 consecutive plate appearances. The latter streak included nine consecutive hits. Smith also won praise in 1944 for his baseball intelligence and as a player who \"never made a mistake or missed a signal.\" In August 1944, Syracuse manager Jewel Ens said: \"Smith is the miracle man of the 1944 season. . . . He's the best hit-and-run man in the league. He's a great hustler and a fine all-around player, and you can say one more thing, he's a credit to the game.\"\n\nAt the end of the 1944 season, Smith had compiled a career-high .340 batting average (.495 on-base percentage), won the International League batting title, led the league with 149 walks, and compiled 232 total bases, 42 extra base hits and 12 stolen bases in 150 games. He was unanimously selected to the International League All-Star team and finished second behind Howard Moss in voting for the International League Most Valuable Player award.\n\nOn November 1, 1944, following his breakout season with the Bisons, Smith was selected by Connie Mack of the Philadelphia Athletics in the Rule 5 draft. However, Smith's opportunity to play in the big leagues was delayed by illness. In February 1945, Smith contracted rheumatic fever and was taken to Buffalo General Hospital by ambulance. He was hospitalized for three weeks and lost 20 pounds as the ailment settled into his arms and shoulders. In March 1945, \"The Sporting News\" reported that Smith would remain \"flat on his back\" for six more weeks and that he had given up hope of playing baseball in 1945. Smith said that he intended to return to his home in Florida as soon as he was well enough to walk.\n\nSmith was advised by doctors to remain out of baseball in 1945, but by the end of May 1945, he began working out with the Bisons. He joined the Athletics in mid-June and made his Major League Baseball debut at age 30 on June 24, 1945. He appeared in 73 games with the 1945 Philadelphia Athletics and became the team's starting left fielder for the last part of the season. The 1945 Athletics finished in last place in the American League and compiled a 52–98 () record. Smith compiled a .212 batting average and a .333 on-base percentage.\n\nIn December 1945, the Athletics traded Smith and Steve Gerkin to the Triple A Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League in exchange for Wandel B. \"Lefty\" Mossor. Smith played for the Beavers for three years from 1946 to 1948.\n\nIn 1946, Smith led the Beavers in putouts by an outfielder with 298 in 122 games. Although his batting average was .249, his propensity to draw walks boosted his on-base percentage to .341.\n\nIn 1947, Smith hit .311 and drew 79 walks for a .418 on-base percentage. He also had 30 doubles and five home runs and again led the team in putouts by an outfielder with 272 in 128 games. On August 5, 1947, Smith hit an inside-the-park home run in the 11th inning to give the Beavers a victory over the Oakland Oaks.\n\nIn May 1948, Smith was still living in the Portland area when his family was caught in the Vanport Flood. After a dike collapsed, Vanport City, Oregon was deluged. Smith lost his automobile and personal belongings as his home was covered under 15 to 18 feet of water. His wife and six-year-old daughter narrowly escaped from the floodwaters by climbing to the roofs of four different buildings before being rescued.\n\nFor six years from 1949 to 1954, Smith served as a manager, and in some cases player-manager, in the farm system of the New York Yankees. He served as a player-manager of the Class C Amsterdam Rugmakers of the Canadian–American League from 1949 to 1950. In his first month with the Rugmakers, Smith hit six home runs, including three that sailed over the 310-foot right field fence at Amsterdam's Mohawk Mills Park during a double-header against Three Rivers. He totalled a career-high 19 home runs in 1949, also adding 116 RBIs in 119 games. His Amsterdam teams finished in fifth and fourth place in the Canadian–American League.\n\nIn December 1950, he was promoted to Class B as the manager of the Norfolk Tars of the Piedmont League. Smith served as the Tars manager in 1951 and 1952 and led the team to Piedmont League pennants both years. His 1952 Norfolk team compiled a 96–36 () record. Noting that the 1952 team included Bill Skowron, Bill Virdon, Johnny Kucks and Gus Triandos, Smith later recalled: \"Manage a team like that? Shucks, I could go fishing.\"\n\nIn December 1952, based on the strength of his performance in Norfolk, the Yankees promoted Smith to the Double-A Birmingham Barons of the Southern Association. He was the Barons' manager from 1953 to 1954.\n\nIn October 1954, at age 39, Smith was named manager of the Philadelphia Phillies, replacing Terry Moore. Phillies general manager Roy Hamey made the announcement and introduced Smith at a press conference in the Warwick Hotel. \"The Sporting News\" described the reaction to the Phillies' hiring of an unknown minor league manager:\"[Hamey] grabbed a microphone which was convenient and said, 'This is Mayo Smith, the new manager of the Phillies.' ... For at least one minute there was an embarrassing silence. Still no one knew who he was. To say that the gathering was surprised was the greatest understatement of the year. Fifty men were speechless. They had more or less expected a new manager, a Lefty O'Doul, a Lou Boudreau or a Skeeter Newsome. But Mayo Smith ... who is he?\"\nDespite the \"loud guffaws\" among the Philadelphia press, Yankees manager Casey Stengel endorsed the hiring of Smith, saying:\"Mayo will make good. He is one of the coming young managers in baseball. I watched him closely in my advance camps, and he was the one manager in the Yankee chain who asked questions, who wanted to know why I liked things done this way and not that way. He never intimated that he knew all the answers. He kept notes, and he learned.\"\n\nRed Smith described the relatively unknown Smith at the time: \"He is tall and rangy, with graying brown hair and young, pleasant features smoothly tanned. There are crinkly lines of laughter around his blue eyes.\"\n\nAfter winning the National League pennant in 1950 (the year of the \"Whiz Kids\"), the Phillies had dropped into the middle of the National League, compiling a losing record in 1954. Smith became the team's fourth manager in three years. In Smith's first year with the Phillies, the team started poorly, dropping to 11 games below .500. The team rallied in the second half of the season and finished in fourth place with a 77–77 record, including 23 wins by pitcher Robin Roberts. At the end of the season, Smith received 30 of 99 votes by the Baseball Writers' Association of America as the 1955 National League Manager of the Year; he finished in second place behind Walter Alston.\n\nThe Phillies slipped to 71–83 in 1956 with Richie Ashburn being the only regular player to bat over .289. After six consecutive 20-win seasons, Robin Roberts led the National League with 18 losses in 1956 while falling 1 win short of 20. In September 1956, and despite the losing record, the Phillies showed their confidence in Smith by signing him to a one-year contract extension through the 1957 season.\n\nIn 1957, the Phillies returned to 77–77 despite pitcher Robin Roberts having a losing record of 10–22. Pitcher Jack Sanford, named Rookie of the Year in 1957, saved the Phillies from falling below .500 with his record of 19–8. In 1958, the team slipped below .500 with a record of 39–45 in late July. On July 22, 1958, Smith was fired and replaced by Eddie Sawyer.\n\nAfter Smith was fired, the 1958 Phillies dropped to last place under Sawyer. The Phillies finished in last place in the National League for four consecutive years from 1958 to 1961. In Smith's 3-1/2 years with the Phillies, he compiled a 264–281 record (). In the three-and-a-half years after he was fired, the Phillies fell to 200–332 ().\n\nIn August 1958, shortly after Smith was fired by the Phillies, unconfirmed reports were published indicating that a deal was in the works for the Cincinnati Reds to hire Smith as their manager. Jimmy Dykes had been named interim manager after Birdie Tebbetts resigned the post. At the end of September, Smith signed a one-year contract to take over as manager for the 1959 season. Cincinnati general manager Gabe Paul announced: \"We believe that in [43-year-old] Mayo Smith we have a young, progressive, middle-of-the-road manager who will help formulate the kind of baseball organization that will result in success for our club.\" In \"The Cincinnati Post\", Pat Harmon expressed skepticism: \"[T]he naming of Smith caused no ripple of excitement in the city. Here is a man who had a fourth and two fifths and was dropped by the Phillies.\"\n\nSmith took over a Reds team that finished the 1958 season in fourth place with a 76–78 record. The team featured Vada Pinson and future Hall of Famer Frank Robinson, but lacked a pitcher who would win more than 13 games in 1959. After a good start, the Reds fell to seventh place with a 35–45 record at the All-Star break. On July 8, 1959, Smith was fired and replaced by Fred Hutchinson, who became the Reds' fourth manager in less than a year. Cincinnati sports writer Earl Lawson wrote that the change was driven by the belief that the team required tougher leadership. Lawson wrote:\"Perhaps it's fitting to say that Smith is an example of Leo Durocher's oft-repeated statement, 'Nice guys finish last.' Ball players 'liked' Smith and were quick to admit this, but whether they respected his judgment is questionable. 'Chewing-out' players was foreign to his personality.\"\nSmith felt he was never given a chance in Cincinnati and spoke out against demands for instant success. He said, \"It was humiliating. I hardly had a chance to get acquainted with the players.\"\n\nDuring the 1950s, Smith also had several business interests. In 1958, he developed a $600,000-plus, state-of-the-art \"bowling palace\" on the Dixie Highway in Palm Beach County, Florida. The facility was equipped with automatic pin-setters, air conditioning, a nursery for bowlers with young children, and pro shop. Smith secured investments from other Major League Baseball managers and players, including Fred Hutchinson and Hank Sauer, and the facility was called Major League Lanes. By the end of 1959, Smith also had successful business interests in Florida real estate, West Virginia oil, and a bowling alley chain in the Carolinas.\n\nIn September 1959, Smith, at age 44, Smith returned to the New York Yankees as \"a field executive with duties as a major and minor league scout.\" Despite his business interests, Smith explained the attraction of returning to baseball:\"It's simply that baseball gets in your blood and you can't get it out. Like being a compulsive gambler or something along those lines. You know when you become a manager, that you're going to be fired sooner or later, no matter how good a job you feel you are doing. From the moment you sign the contract you're as disposable as a wounded pirate. The only two guys who ever beat the rap were Connie Mack and Clark Griffith. That's because they owned the club.\"\n\nAt the end of the 1960 season, Casey Stengel retired as the Yankees' manager, and Smith was rumored to be a candidate to replace Stengel. Ralph Houk was chosen instead. In 1961, Smith was described as \"a combination master scout and trouble shooter\" for the Yankees. He remained a scout in the Yankees organization until 1966. During his years as a scout for the Yankees, Smith \"toured the press rooms and the better watering spots\" across the major leagues, \"avail[ed] himself of free food and drinks in press rooms,\" developed a reputation as \"a warm friendly man\", and was sometimes referred to as \"America's Guest.\"\n\nPrior to the 1964 World Series, Smith was assigned to scout the St. Louis Cardinals. He reported that Tim McCarver hit every ball to left field. Smith later recalled that, after Game 2 of the World Series, as McCarver pulled every ball to right field, Yogi Berra came to him and said, \"You sure you were watching McCarver hit or were you somewhere else?\"\n\nDuring the 1966 season, the manager of the Detroit Tigers, Chuck Dressen, suffered a heart attack and eventually died in mid-August. After Dressen's heart attack, the Tigers named Bob Swift as manager. Swift was diagnosed with lung cancer (he died two months after Dressen), and Frank Skaff filled in for the rest of the season. As the team searched for a new manager, both Al López and Bill Rigney turned down the position. On October 3, 1966, the Tigers' general manager Jim Campbell signed Mayo Smith to a two-year contract at an annual salary of $40,000. As had been the case in Philadelphia and St. Louis, the hiring of relatively unknown Smith was not met with enthusiasm in the Detroit press. Joe Falls of the \"Detroit Free Press\" called him a \"noboby\" who fit Jim Campbell's image of the \"elderly, experienced, devoted\" manager. Jerry Green of \"The Detroit News\" later wrote: \"Sportswriters covering the team at the time regarded Smith as a bland man without imagination.\"\n\nWithin several days after being hired, Smith put together a new coaching staff, includingTony Cuccinello as third base coach, Johnny Sain as pitching coach, Hal Naragon as the bull-pen coach, and Wally Moses as first-base coach.\n\nSmith took over a talented team that had not played up to expectations, finishing third, fourth or fifth for five consecutive years. At his first press conference in Detroit, Smith identified pitching as the problem that most required attention and the outfield (featuring Al Kaline, Willie Horton, Jim Northrup, Mickey Stanley, and Gates Brown) as the greatest strength. His first major initiative was a realignment of the infield. He announced in the fall of 1966 that he intended to shore up the team defensively by moving Dick McAuliffe from shortstop to second base and having Ray Oyler take over as shortstop. Smith's decision was met with \"some public sneering.\" Dick McAuliffe had been the Tigers starting shortstop since 1962 and had been selected as an All-Star in 1965 and 1966. And while Oyler was considered an excellent defensive shortstop, he had hit below .200 in both 1965 and 1966.\n\nThe 1967 Tigers got off to a quick start, compiling 26-14 record in the first 40 games. Catcher Bill Freehan began the season with a hot bat, saw his batting average climb by 50 points in 1967 over 1966, increased his RBI total from 46 to 74, and finished third in the voting for the 1967 American League Most Valuable Player. Freehan credited Smith and Wally Moses for improving his offensive performance.\n\nThe 1967 season proved to be a roller-coaster ride, as the team lost 10 of 12 games from June 7 to 19, won seven in a row from July 2 to 9, and then lost six in a row. As the team endured successive hot and cold periods, Smith developed a reputation for \"keeping his cool\" and not \"chewing out\" his players. Smith resisted juggling his line-up, noting that he saw his role as building confidence and that he did not want to over-manage the team. In September, the Tigers were caught in a four-way pennant race with the Red Sox, Twins, and White Sox. The Tigers won 17 of the last 27 games and finished the season with a 91–71 () record—one game behind the Red Sox, losing the pennant on the last day of the season after splitting a doubleheader with the California Angels.\n\nThe following year, the 1968 Detroit Tigers won the American League pennant by 12 games with a record of 103–59 ().\n\nSmith was credited with mentoring pitcher Denny McLain during the 1968 season. McLain, who became the first pitcher since 1934 to win 30 games, went 31-6 with a 1.96 ERA, won the Cy Young Award and the American League Most Valuable Player Award. Asked about McLain's sometimes odd statements, Smith was protective, noting, \"This is a 24-year-old boy reaching for Utopia. . . . You can't take the brashness away from him, and you wouldn't want to.\"\n\nThe 1968 season was not free from controversy. After being pulled from a game in August, pitcher Joe Sparma told a reporter that he felt \"humiliated\" and made \"rather harsh comments\" about Smith. When asked for a response, Smith said he \"didn't want to get into a spitting contest with a skunk.\" Smith refused to start Sparma for several weeks afterward. When Sparma finally got another start on September 17, 1968, he pitched a one-run complete game against the Yankees to clinch the pennant. The Sparma-Smith feud continued, and Sparma pitched only 1/3 of an inning in the 1968 World Series.\n\nAnother August controversy arose after Dick McAuliffe charged the mound and knocked down Chicago White Sox pitcher Tommy John. American League president Joe Cronin initially imposed a $250 fine on McAuliffe, but subsequently modified the sanction to include a five-day penalty. Smith was convinced that Cronin had been swayed by the White Sox, exchanged angry words with Cronin in a phone call, and publicly called Cronin \"a weak man\" who had been caught in \"a big lie.\" When the Tigers won the World Series, Cronin sought to patch up his relationship with Smith, but Smith declined, saying, \"I don't get over things like this right away.\"\n\nThe biggest setback of the season was the loss of future Baseball Hall of Fame inductee and right fielder Al Kaline to an injury. Kaline broke his arm after being hit by a pitch in late May and missed nearly three months of the season. When he returned in August, Smith was faced with a problem in getting him back into the lineup. Left fielder Willie Horton finished the 1968 season second in the American League with 36 home runs and a .543 slugging percentage. Center-fielder Mickey Stanley led all American League outfielders with a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage and was on his way to a second consecutive Gold Glove Award. Jim Northrup, who had taken over Kaline's spot in right field, finished the 1968 season third in the league with 90 RBIs and hit five grand slams during the season. Smith played Kaline at first base for 22 games, but the team already had Norm Cash as its regular first baseman. Concerned about his team's offense as the team prepared for the World Series, Smith moved Stanley to shortstop for the last nine games of the regular season. Stanley replaced Ray Oyler, who was an excellent fielder but hit only .135 for the season.\n\nThe Tigers won the pennant and faced the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1968 World Series. Behind the pitching of Bob Gibson, the Cardinals took a 3-to-1 edge in the first four games. The Tigers won the final three games to capture the World Series.\n\nSmith's strategic moves in the World Series drew praise even from those who had previously been critics. Smith's most dramatic strategic call was his decision to continue playing center-fielder Mickey Stanley at shortstop, for all seven games of the World Series. Even Smith's closest friends questioned the move, and critics gravely opined that he was weakening the Tigers at two positions, given Stanley's Gold Glove season in center field. While Stanley made two errors, neither led to a Cardinal run, and his play at shortstop was generally solid. More importantly, the move allowed Smith to keep both Jim Northrup and Al Kaline in the line-up, and each had key hits to fuel the Tigers' comeback against the Cardinals. Kaline had a .379 batting average in the World Series with two home runs, eight RBIs, and the game-winning hit in Game 5. Northrup also belted two home runs (including a grand slam in Game 6), hit a two-run triple in Game 7, and totalled eight RBIs.\n\n\"The Boston Globe\" later called Smith's move of Stanley to shortstop for the World Series \"the gutsiest move in history.\" ESPN has ranked Smith's decision to move Stanley to shortstop as the third \"gutsiest call\" in sports history, and one of the Ten Greatest Coaching Decisions of the 20th Century in any sport.\n\nSmith also drew praise for his adjustments to the pitching rotation in the World Series. Watson Spoelstra wrote: \"Mayo's managing against the Cardinals couldn't have been better.\" With the Cardinals leading the series 3–1, the Tigers trailed 3–2 in the seventh inning of Game 5. In the bottom of the seventh inning, Smith opted to allow starting pitcher Mickey Lolich to bat, despite the Tigers need to put a runner on base. Lolich got a base hit to start a two-run rally, scored the tying run, struck out Roger Maris and picked off Lou Brock in the ninth inning, and pitched his second complete-game victory of the series. In Game 6, Smith surprised observers by calling on Denny McLain to start on two days rest, and despite poor performances in Games 1 and 4. The Tigers gave McLain a 12–0 lead with a 10-run third inning, and McLain pitched a complete game, allowing only one run. In Game 7, Smith called on Lolich to pitch on two days rest. Matched against Bob Gibson, Lolich pitched his third complete game, allowing only one run, and led the team to a 4–1 victory.\n\nAt the end of the 1968 season, Smith received The Sporting News Manager of the Year Award, receiving 17 of 19 votes. \"The Sporting News\" noted that the key players on the 1968 Tigers \"had been around for several years, when the Tigers were going nowhere. The man whose arrival coincided with a Tiger awakening is Mayo Smith. . . . Mayo is making it tough for people who claim the manager isn't important.\" Smith also received a two-year contract extension with a $15,000 raise to $55,000 a season. Smith's fan mail was so voluminous after the Tigers won the World Series that it took five people two full days to put things in order.\n\nIn 1969, the Tigers compiled a 90–72 () record but finished in second place – 19 games behind the 1969 Baltimore Orioles. The team relied on power as four players (Cash, Kaline, Horton and Northrup) hit more than 20 home runs, but lacked speed and finished last in the American League with only 35 stolen bases. Denny McLain won 24 games, and Mickey Lolich won 19 while striking out 271 batters. With the second-place finish, Smith's teams had finished in first or second place for three consecutive years. No Detroit manager had accomplished that feat since Steve O'Neill from 1945 to 1947.\n\nIn 1970, the Tigers fell to 79–83 () in a season marked by the suspension of Denny McLain for his association with bookmakers and by the publication of Bill Freehan's behind-the-scenes book on the 1969 team. The Tigers were in third place, seven games behind Baltimore, at the end of June, but collapsed in the second half of the season, finishing 29 games behind the Orioles. McLain won only three games in 1970, and Mickey Lolich led the American League with 19 losses and a 14–19 record. The team's power-hitting lineup also lost its punch, as no player hit more than 17 home runs. The team also compiled the lowest batting average in the American League at .238.\n\nAs the 1970 Tigers headed for their first losing season since 1963 and their worst record since 1960, Smith came under increasing criticism from fans and the press. Immediately after the season, on October 2, 1970, the Tigers fired Smith and replaced him with Billy Martin. Before leaving Detroit, Smith called the city a great sports town in his farewell news conference, but he privately lashed out at the fans in a conversation with reporters: \"They wouldn't know a baseball player from a Japanese aviator. The fans in Detroit are ignorant. They'd rather see you leave a tired pitcher in and get beat with a complete game than bring in a fresh one that might win it for you.\"\n\nIn all or parts of nine seasons as a manager, Smith compiled an overall record of 662–612 ().\n\nAfter spending most of the 1971 season at his home in Florida, Smith was hired by Charlie Finley as a special scout for the Oakland Athletics during the last month of the 1971 season. He was assigned to cover the Baltimore Orioles in preparation for the 1971 American League Championship Series. On September 2, 1971, \"The Baltimore Sun\" reported on Smith's espionage assignment: \"Super Spy Sets Sights on Birds.\" Despite Smith's scouting report, the Orioles swept the A's in three games as Dave McNally, Mike Cuellar and Jim Palmer held the A's to seven runs in three games.\n\nIn March 1940, Smith married Louise Pauline Otto in a ceremony held at the Our Savior Lutheran Church in Lake Worth, Florida. Both were graduates of Lake City High School. They had a daughter, Judith Ann, and a son, Fred M. Smith. During the off-season and in retirement, Smith and his wife continued to live in Lake Worth.\n\nIn November 1977, Smith suffered a massive stroke while dining with his family at a restaurant in Lake Worth. He did not regain consciousness and died at age 62 at Bethesda Memorial Hospital in Boynton Beach.\n\nIn 1983, the \"Mayo Smith Society\" was formed in Smith's memory. It continues to operate as the international fan club for Tigers fans, sponsoring an annual spring training trip, an annual gathering in Detroit, making charitable contributions, and publishing the \"Tigers Stripes\" and \"E-Mayo Flash\" newsletters. Society co-founder Dale Petroskey (later president of the Baseball Hall of Fame) told \"The New York Times\" in 2006 that \"Smith inspired the club's name because he was 'a somewhat forgettable figure in Tiger history' who shocked baseball in 1968 by moving center fielder Mickey Stanley to shortstop for the Series. 'What an amazingly bold roll of the dice . . . Mayo gambled big time, and he won.\"\n\nSince 2004, the Mayo Smith Society has given its annual \"King Tiger Award\" to a Detroit Tigers player for on-field and off-field contributions. The players receiving the award are:\n\n\n"}

It is native to Europe and southwestern Asia. and widely naturalized in other regions including North America.\n\nNipplewort is an annual or perennial herbaceous plant growing to tall, with erect, hairy branching stems and clear (not milky) sap. The leaves are alternate and spirally arranged; the larger leaves at the base of the flowering stem are often pinnate, with a large oval terminal leaflet and one to four small side leaflets, while smaller leaves higher on the stem are simple oval; all leaves have toothed margins. The flowers are yellow, produced in a capitulum diameter, the capitula being numerous in loose clusters at the top of the stem. The capitulum is surrounded by a whorl of involucral bracts, the outer ones very small and the inner ones erect, narrow and stiff and all the same length. The eight to fifteen florets are all ligulate and pale yellow, shaped like a tongue with a five-toothed tip. Each has five stamens and a gynoecium composed of two fused carpels.

{"id": "2039308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2039308", "title": "Pilning railway station", "text": "Pilning railway station\n\nPilning railway station is a minor station on the South Wales Main Line near Pilning, South Gloucestershire, England. It is from and is the last station on the English side before the Severn Tunnel through to Wales. Its three letter station code is PIL. It is managed by Great Western Railway, who provide the two train services per week from the station.\n\nThe station was opened by the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway in 1863, but was resited in 1886 when the Severn Tunnel was opened. The station had an extensive goods yard, boasting one of the largest railway communities in the Bristol area, and operated a motorail service to Wales. In 1928 the original station was reopened on the Severn Beach Line, which allowed passengers and freight to reach Avonmouth Docks, though this only lasted until 1964. The goods yard was closed in 1965, and the station buildings later demolished, with very little in the way of facilities. Passenger services also declined, to two trains per day in the 1970s and the current service level of two trains per week in 2006.\n\nThe station's footbridge was removed in 2016 as part of Great Western Main Line electrification project, meaning that only eastbound trains can now use the station. Campaigners have alleged this is part of an attempted closure by stealth, although the incident raised the station's profile nationally. Pilning is one of the least-used stations in Britain, but passenger numbers have increased in recent years due to efforts by the Pilning Station Group.\n\nPilning railway station is located in the Pilning area of South Gloucestershire, north of the Bristol conurbation. The surrounding area is primarily farmland, with the village itself some further west. The station is on the South Wales Main Line between and , from and from via Bristol Parkway. West of Pilning, the railway descends into a cutting and then into the Severn Tunnel, emerging in Wales at , away. The next station to the east is , distant. The station sits on an embankment, with a bridge over the road east of the station and over an irrigation channel at the west.\n\nThe railway through Pilning has three tracks: from north to south these are the Up Tunnel towards Bristol; the Down Tunnel towards Wales; and then the Down Pilning Loop, also towards Wales. A fourth track, the Up Pilning Loop, ends just west of the station. All three tracks through the station are unidirectional. The two Tunnel lines have a speed limit, while the loop has a speed limit of . Despite there being three tracks, Pilning only has a single platform in use, Platform 1, on the north side of the line. This is long and serves trains towards Bristol. The old down platform, Platform 2, sits between the Down Tunnel and Down Pilning Loop, but is no longer accessible to the public. It is long. There is an old brick station building on Platform 1 but it is not in railway use. Infrastructure owner Network Rail has a compound at the station.\n\nFacilities at Pilning are extremely basic: the platform, which is covered by CCTV, has a bus stop-style shelter on it but no seats. Customer help points on the platform and timetable boards provide service information, but there are no facilities for buying tickets. There is a free car park with 10 spaces and four bicycle stands, and also a payphone. Access is via a long ramp from the main road.\n\nPilning is consistently one of the least-used stations in Britain, recording less than 50 annual passengers several times between 1997 and 2015. Numbers have since increased by a factor of ten, thanks in part to campaigns by the Pilning Station Group; however as of 2017/18 it is still the 35th least used station of the 2,559 in Britain.\n\nPilning is managed by Great Western Railway, which operate all services from the station. A parliamentary service of two trains per week operates; as of the December 2019 timetable these are the Saturday 08:33 and 14:33 services from to and respectively. The standard journey time to Bristol Temple Meads is 20 minutes, and to Taunton is 80 minutes. Services at Pilning are formed using , and diesel multiple-unit trains. Due to there being no westbound trains, a fares easement is in place allowing passengers to travel to in order to return eastbound to Pilning. Rail replacement buses do not call at Pilning; in the event of engineering works taxis are provided instead.\n\nGreat Western Railway services between and South Wales pass through Pilning non-stop throughout the day, two trains per hour in each direction on weekdays, one train per hour at weekends. Other Great Western Railway services between Cardiff and Taunton or also pass through non-stop, again two trains per hour in each direction on weekdays, one train per hour at weekends. Freight trains also operate through Pilning, roughly two per hour each way, with many transporting coal between Bristol and South Wales.\n\nPilning railway station first opened on 8 September 1863 when services began on the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway (BSWUR). The railway ran from to , north of Bristol on the banks of the River Severn, where passengers could transfer onto a ferry to cross the river into Wales. The line, engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was built as single track broad gauge. Pilning was from Temple Meads, initially the fifth station along the line, between east and west. There was a single platform on the north side of the line, and a siding to the south. Few details are known about this iteration of the station, nor are there any photos from its time in use. The station was east of the village of Pilning in Gloucestershire, on Pilning Street, a road between Pilning and Easter Compton, which was further south. The immediate area was farmland with little in the way of housing, although there was a pub, The Plough, across the road from the station. To the east the line crossed the road at a level crossing, which was operated from the station using levers. There were initially six trains per day on weekdays in each direction, with three trains per day on Sundays.\n\nIn 1868 the BSWUR was amalgamated with the Great Western Railway (GWR), which had from the beginning operated all BSWUR services; and in 1873 the line was converted to standard gauge.\n\nAlthough the BSWUR made travel from Bristol to Wales easier, the change from train to ferry to train was inconvenient, and so plans to build a tunnel under the Severn were considered even before the railway opened. Parliamentary permission was gained in 1872, with construction beginning in 1873. GWR chairman Daniel Gooch and other directors visited Pilning in 1884 as part of an inspection tour of the works. The route to the tunnel diverged from the New Passage line east of Pilning, necessitating the building of a replacement station on the new line, approximately south of the original. The new station opened with the first passenger services through the tunnel on 1 December 1886. The New Passage branch, including the original station, was closed to passengers the same day, despite requests from local residents that a reduced service continue to operate. The route remained in goods use to allow trains to deliver coal to the Severn Tunnel pumping station, which was on a spur off the New Passage route.\n\nThe new station was built on an embankment, and would eventually become known as Pilning High Level. The railway crossed the road via a bridge east of the original station's level crossing, and the new station entrance adjacent to that level crossing. To the west the line went into a cutting descending towards the Severn Tunnel. The station embankment also crossed a small irrigation channel at Gumhurn Bridge. The new station was further along the line from Bristol at , with Patchway now to the east, having been resited in 1885. The next station west was , away the other side of the Severn. There were two platforms, either side of the two running lines, although double-tracking to Patchway was only completed in 1887. The northern platform served eastbound trains, the southern one was for westbound trains. The station buildings were of a standard GWR design with chimneys and a fretted canopy; however this design bore no resemblance to the other stations along the line. The main station building was on the northern platform, containing the station master's office, booking office, parcels office and toilets. There was a smaller waiting room on the westbound platform. The platforms were wooden, with gas lamps and wooden bench seats. A large covered footbridge connected the platforms east of the buildings. In 1905 there were 30 staff employed by the station – 14 signalmen, 6 signalmen/porters, 8 porters, a tunnel inspector and the stationmaster – making it one of the largest railway communities in the Bristol area. Staff members were given first aid training and examinations by St John Ambulance, with an annual awards event.\n\nThe station had a large goods yard to the south and east of the station, including a cattle pen and loading bay at the east end of the northern platform. A siding between the platforms and the junction was converted to a goods loop in 1904, a westbound goods loop south of the station was laid in 1905, and a further eastbound loop just west of the station in 1906. The station had two signal boxes: Station Box was sited at the western end of the southern platform and had 54 levers; Junction Box was east at the eastern end of the goods yard and had 68 levers. As the final station before the Severn Tunnel, the yard was used to inspect wagons before they entered the tunnel, and also to house an emergency rescue locomotive. Heavier trains had a special brake van added, as the standard Great Western brake van had an open veranda and thus exposed the guards to choking fumes while in the tunnel. Banking locomotives were also kept at Pilning to help trains with the steep slopes between the Severn Tunnel and Patchway.\nIn 1910, the GWR introduced a Motorail service through the Severn Tunnel, operating between Pilning and Severn Tunnel Junction. Vehicles were loaded onto special wagons which were then attached to passenger trains using two dedicated shunting locomotives. Waterproof covers were available to protect cars from the conditions inside the tunnel, while passengers travelled in a coach hauled by the same train. There were usually two or three such trains per day. The service continued for more than fifty years, barring a cessation during World War One. The opening of the Severn Bridge in 1966, allowing direct road travel between Bristol and South Wales, brought about the end of the service, with the final train running on 6 October 1966.\n\nIn 1900, the GWR built a new branch from the route to New Passage, running along the banks of the Severn to the docks at Avonmouth. This allowed trains to travel via the original station at Pilning and avoid congestion along the line via central Bristol. The line was single-track throughout, but Pilning had a passing loop and two loop sidings adjacent to the line. The loop was capable of holding a train of 60 wagons, while the sidings could hold 52 and 48 wagons. A brick signal box, Pilning Branch Box, more commonly known as Low Level, was opened adjacent to the level crossing in 1917. It had ten levers controlling the crossing and the eastern end of the passing loops, the western end being controlled by a ground frame. The level crossing had manually-controlled gates, requiring the signaller to leave the signal box in order to operate them. The crossing was also at the bottom of a gradient, with train operators advised to approach it cautiously. Trains working from Wales to Avonmouth required elaborate shunting moves - there was no path between the two without reversing - and so the level crossing was frequently closed, leading to traffic jams. A new route to Avonmouth, via , was opened in 1910, but no direct connection between South Wales and Avonmouth was built until 1971.\n\nIn the early 1900s the nearby village of Severn Beach became a popular seaside resort, with a station opening there in 1922 for trains via Avonmouth. This spurred the upgrading of the line from Pilning to Avonmouth to passenger traffic: inspections occurred in 1927, approval was granted on 24 April 1928, and the first passenger services ran on 23 June 1928. The station at Pilning on this line opened on 9 July 1928, referred to variously as Pilning Halt, Pilning Low Level Halt and Pilning Low Level, although the latter was the most common. The station on the route via the Severn Tunnel was renamed Pilning High Level, with the station boards noting \"Junction for Severn Beach and Avonmouth\". The total cost of construction of the new stations at Pilning, and was estimated at £502.\n\nThe new Low Level station was on the site of the original station, from Bristol Temple Meads. Patchway was the next station east, away, while to the west Cross Hands Halt was distant. The station had a single -long wooden platform on the north side of the line, with no facilities or lighting. The shortness of the platform meant that only two carriages could be accommodated, and so passengers were required to travel in the correct part of the train in order to alight. Tickets were sold from the High Level station, whose stationmaster oversaw the Low Level also. The Low Level station handled parcels traffic, unlike other halts on the route. The station had no water tower, and so locomotives were required to travel to High Level to use the facilities there. A small shelter and platform lighting were added by 1959. The initial service along this loop was nine trains per day on weekdays and four on Sundays, mostly running circular trips to and from Bristol Temple Meads via and Patchway.\n\nWhen the railways were nationalised in 1948, Pilning came under the aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. In 1949 there were seven trains towards South Wales and eight towards Bristol from Wales each day, with two each way on Sundays. The Low Level station saw an additional five trains per day towards Bristol via Patchway, and seven per day towards Severn Beach, with some continuing to Bristol from there. Many trains via Severn Beach would terminate at Pilning Low Level. Passenger services between Severn Beach and Pilning were withdrawn on 23 November 1964, causing the closure of the Low Level platform. The line to Avonmouth continued in freight use, however in 1968 a work to rule incident precipitated the closure: a signaller at Pilning Branch Box took a sick day and train staff refused to work the crossing gates themselves. The line was officially closed on 1 September 1968 following this incident, with the Divisional Movements Manager stating it was surplus to requirements. The tracks and signal box remained in place until at least August 1970, but were eventually removed. The site is now in agricultural use, and the only remnants of the station are level crossing gates: one remaining in situ, the other now used at the Didcot Railway Centre.\n\nThe High Level station continued in use, but reverted to its original name, Pilning, on 6 May 1968. During the 1950s a brick building was built on the northern platform, and around the same time the footbridge had its roof and walls removed, leaving users exposed to the elements. The goods yard was closed on 29 November 1965, with the good loops westbound towards the tunnel cut short in February 1968 and the eastbound loop between the High Level station and the junction removed in May 1969. The Motorail loading bay was used to store a Fire Service emergency train for the Severn Tunnel, however this had been relocated to Severn Tunnel Junction by 1991. The Junction and Station signal boxes were closed on 15 March 1971, with control passed to Bristol Panel Signal Box at Bristol Temple Meads. Passenger services had increased slightly by this point, with nine or ten trains each direction between Bristol and Cardiff from Monday to Saturday and two trains each way on Sundays, but this increase was short-lived, and by 1973 Pilning received only one train per day in each direction. The station buildings had been boarded up by this point, and by 1982 had been demolished, with the exception of the 1950s brick building. Basic shelters were constructed on each platform as a replacement. The few stopping trains had to be timed for daylight hours, as the station lighting had been disconnected. British Rail was split into business-led sectors in the 1980s, at which time operations at Pilning passed to Regional Railways.\n\nThe British rail network was privatised in the 1990s - the infrastructure, including stations, became property of Railtrack in 1994, and were subsequently transferred to Network Rail in 2002. Bristol-area passenger services were franchised to Wales & West in 1997, which was succeeded by Wessex Trains, an arm of National Express, in 2001. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western, a subsidiary company of FirstGroup, rebranded as Great Western Railway in 2015. Services continued at two per day under Wales & West and Wessex Trains, however the Greater Western franchise of 2006 specified only two trains per week at Pilning, and so the service was reduced: from Cardiff to Bristol on Saturday morning and back the same afternoon. The station, isolated and with a skeleton service, was one of the least used stations in the country, with less than 100 passengers per year.\n\nDespite the low patronage, there was local interest in the station. The Pilning Station Group, founded by local resident Jonathan King in the 1980s, campaigned for an increase in services. Upon King's death in 2014, a small plaque dedicated to him was added to the brick abutment of the footbridge. The Group devised challenges for people to travel from Pilning on the morning train, get as far as possible, and then return on the evening train. The Group also successfully campaigned for an extra train to call to support a local music festival.\nOn 5 November 2016, the footbridge at Pilning was demolished by Network Rail as part of the Great Western Main Line electrification project, as the bridge was too low for overhead wires and the low passenger numbers did not justify a replacement. The removal of the footbridge meant that the westbound platform was no longer accessible and thus was closed, with the final train having called on 10 September. Campaigners alleged that the removal amounted to a closure by stealth, with Network Rail apologising for not consulting residents or conforming to their code of best practice. Due to trains only being able to call in the eastbound direction, a fares easement was implemented to allow westbound travel to in order to return eastbound to Pilning, with the westbound service being replaced by a second eastbound service. Geoff Marshall and Vicki Pipe visited Pilning in 2017 as part of their All the Stations project, attracting local media attention to the station's status. There was subsequently a campaign for Pilning to receive the footbridge from , following that station's closure in May 2019, however Network Rail stated that there was no financial justification for replacing the bridge. Local rail group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways claim that Network Rail saved £658,000 by removing the bridge, and that a replacement would cost in the region of £5,000,000–7,000,000.\n\nRailway staff have suffered injuries or death at Pilning; in 1893, signalman George Hann sustained severe cuts to the neck and throat after being hit by shards of glass from an unwanted bottle of lemon squash, which had been thrown from a passing train and smashed against the signal box's woodwork. A platelayer was hit by a train in 1908, suffering a broken arm; and in 1942 track worker George Daniel Garland was killed while spreading ashes - witnesses stated that there was no lookout and that high winds prevented the train being heard. Two staff are also known to have died at Pilning from natural causes: train driver James Winnicombe, who collapsed on the footplate in 1929; and track worker John Holbrook, who died in a workmen's cabin in 1932.\n\nPassengers have also been the victims of accidents. On 31 May 1874, a seven-year-old child, Arthur Edward Claypole, and a nurse, Maria Hall, fell from an express train. Claypole had been leaning on the door when it came open causing him to fall out, with Hall jumping out after him. Claypole died from the injuries sustained. An insufficient door fastening was cited as the cause of the incident.\n\nA major incident occurred in 1933, when a London, Midland and Scottish Railway excursion train from to caught fire after passing through the Severn Tunnel. The fire, which started in the restaurant car, spread to two other coaches. The train was stopped at Pilning, where the three burning carriages were removed to a siding and allowed to burn, also setting fire to the grass on the embankment. There were no injuries among the passengers; an attendant was injured while attempting to rescue property from the burning carriages. The rest of the train continued to Barnstaple and arrived an hour late, but 70 passengers from the affected carriages had to be carried by a later train.\n\nThe South Wales Main Line through Pilning is being electrified using overhead wires. Major works at Pilning began in 2016 with the demolition of the footbridge, and were due for completion in 2019, but this has been delayed due to corrosion in the Severn Tunnel. The electrification works made use of the Network Rail compound at Pilning.\n\nService improvements at Pilning are supported by both the Pilning Station Group and Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways. While Severn Beach railway station is nearby, Pilning potentially offers much quicker access to Bristol and Wales. The campaigners note that 25,000 jobs are due to be created in the area as part of the Westgate development, and that a new junction on the M49 motorway could allow for a park and ride-type station \"Pilning Parkway\". Requests for extra services have however been rebuffed, with Great Western Railway stating that Pilning's location on the main line means that stopping trains negatively impact journey times for long distance services. The South East Wales and West of England Business Link, a plan to improve connectivity between and , proposes replacing the existing station with one further west where the B4055 Cross Hands Road crosses the railway. This site is within the village of Pilning, offering better road access and bus interchange. The railway at this point is four-track, allowing stopping trains to be overtaken by fast trains. The plan won the Oliver Lovell Award for best new group at the 2018 Railfuture awards.\n\nThere are expected to be increases in the number of trains passing through Pilning in the years to 2043, with a predicted service of ten passenger trains and up to two freight trains per hour in each direction. Network Rail estimate that 15 trains per hour in each direction could use the route if European Train Control System signalling was implemented.\n\n"}

{"id": "2039341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2039341", "title": "Runway visual range", "text": "Runway visual range\n\nIn aviation, the runway visual range (RVR) is the distance over which a pilot of an aircraft on the centreline of the runway can see the runway surface markings delineating the runway or identifying its centre line. RVR is normally expressed in feet or meters. RVR is used to determine the landing and takeoff conditions for aircraft pilots, as well as the type of operational visual aids used at airport. \n\nOriginally RVR was measured by a person, either by viewing the runway lights from the top of a vehicle parked on the runway threshold, or by viewing special angled runway lights from a tower at one side of the runway. The number of lights visible could then be converted to a distance to give the RVR. This is known as the \"human observer method\" and can still be used as a fall-back.\n\nToday most airports use instrumented runway visual range (IRVR), which is measured by devices called scatterometers which provide simplified installation as they are integrated units and can be installed as single unit(s) at a critical location along the runway or transmissometers which are installed at one side of a runway relatively close to its edge. Normally three transmissometers are provided, one at each end of the runway and one at the midpoint. In the US, Forward Scatter RVRs are replacing transmissometers at most airports. According to the US Federal Aviation Administration: \"There are approximately 279 RVR systems in the NAS, of which 242 are forward scatter NG RVR Systems and 34 are older Transmissometer Systems.\"\n\nBecause IRVR data are localized information, the values obtained are not necessarily a reliable guide to what a pilot can actually expect to see. This can easily be demonstrated when obscuration such as fog is variable, different values can apply simultaneously at the same physical point.\n\nFor example, a 2000 m runway could have reported touchdown, midpoint and rollout IRVR values of 700m, 400m and 900 m. If the actual RVR at the touchdown point (300 m from the threshold) is 700 m as reported, then a pilot could expect to see the light 700 m away, at the runway midpoint. If the pilot taxies to the midpoint and looks back through the same air mass, he or she must also be able to see the light at the touchdown point, but since the midpoint RVR is reported as 400 m, a light 700 m away must be invisible. Similarly, looking forward he or she cannot see the light in the rollout area, but according to the rollout RVR of 900m, the light there is visible and has already been so for the last 200 m.\n\nRVR is used as one of the main criteria for minima on instrument approaches, as in most cases a pilot must obtain visual reference of the runway to land an aircraft. The maximum RVR range is 2,000 metres or 6,000 feet, above which it is not significant and thus does not need to be reported. RVRs are provided in METARs and are transmitted by air traffic controllers to aircraft making approaches to allow pilots to assess whether it is prudent and legal to make an approach.\n\nRVR is also the main criterion used to determine the category of visual aids that are installed at an airport. The International Civil Aviation Organization ICAO stipulates in its Annex 14 that for RVR values above 550 m, CAT I lighting shall be installed, if RVR is between 300 m and 549 m then CAT II lighting is required. CAT IIIa is installed for RVR values between 175 m and 300 m. CAT IIIb is required for RVR values between 50 m and 175 m while there is no RVR limitation for CAT IIIc visual aids.\n\n"}

It was originally built and designed by John A. Miller and opened in 1924. It was later renovated for the 1968 season, which involved a major track expansion designed by Andy Vettel. It reopened to the public as Thunderbolt.\n\nIn 1924, the Pippin roller coaster was built. In 1958, the Pippin's open-front trains were replaced with Century Flyer trains made by the National Amusement Device company. These are the trains used on the Thunderbolt today. \n\nThe Pippin roller coaster was rebuilt and the Thunderbolt was created in 1968. Most of the ride was left intact except for the double dip, station, and station turn-around to the first hill which were removed in 1968 for the addition of the new front helix hills necessary for the transformation of The Pippin into the new Thunderbolt roller coaster. The four drops down a ravine were incorporated in the Andy Vettel-designed Thunderbolt coaster. \n\nIn 1969, a small \"speed bump\" hill was removed from the inner helix of the front of the coaster near the loading station. The Thunderbolt was rated the #1 roller coaster by the \"New York Times\" in 1974. \n\nIn 1991, the tunnel located at the end of the first dip was removed, providing for a view of Steel Phantom. In 1998, for Kennywood's 100th anniversary, the headlights on the front of the trains were restored when the trains themselves were refurbished.\n\nIn 1999, an accident happened on the Thunderbolt when the operators failed to brake the train coming into the station, colliding with the train being loaded. Thirty people were injured in the crash. After the accident the headlights on the cars were removed partially because the electrical system did not hold up well to the vibration of the cars.\n\nInstallation of Phantom's Revenge resulted in the ride being closed for a few weeks in 2001 so that the new ride could be built through the structure near the Turtle Ride. Phantom's Revenge still however retains Steel Phantom's drop through the Thunderbolt. The ride was still being rebuilt even a few weeks after the new ride opened. In 2006, the trains could be seen sporting the famous T-bolt logo on the fronts of the cars where the center headlights had been.\n\nThunderbolt follows the surrounding terrain with a track length of 3,250 feet (990.6 m). Its maximum height is 70 feet (21.3 m), but because of the track layout and the natural ravines on which the ride is set, the maximum drop is 90 feet (27.4 m). Reaching a maximum speed of 55 mph (88.5 km/h), the ride takes 101 seconds to complete its circuit.\n\nA feature of the Thunderbolt is that after departing from the station, the train does not immediately go up the lift hill as on most other coasters. Instead, it immediately goes into the first drop and the lift hill is in the middle of the ride after the second drop. After the lift hill, riders will go through a 90 ft (27.4m) long drop. After this drop is a tight bend which will result in the rider on the right squishing the rider on the left because there is no seat divider. Kennywood tells guests to have the smaller rider sit on the right to avoid larger riders squishing smaller riders. After this, riders experience several turns and hills before returning to the station.\n\nThunderbolt is an ACE Coaster Classic and Coaster Landmark.\n"}

They are a race who have no gender. They ask the crew for help in finding a shuttle which has gone missing. It is theorized that the shuttle disappeared into a pocket of null space. This is a pocket of space which drains energy rapidly. In short order, a rescue mission is planned, for which Riker volunteers to pilot a shuttle to retrieve the shuttle crew. A member of the J'naii named Soren insists on accompanying Riker, acting as a co-pilot. Soren proves to be a good pilot. Riker and Soren share a meal and become more comfortable with each other. They are interrupted by another J'naii, and Soren leaves quickly.\n\nWhile the pair is charting the null space, the shuttle is damaged, and Soren is injured. While being treated by Dr. Crusher, Soren asks her several questions about female gender identification. While Soren and Riker work on the shuttle, Soren confesses that she is attracted to Riker and states that she has a female gender identity. Soren explains that the J'naii are an androgynous species that view the expression of any sort of male or female gender, and especially sexual liaisons, as a sexual perversion. According to their official doctrine, the J'naii had evolved beyond gender and thus view the idea of male/female sexuality as primitive. Those among the J'naii who view themselves as possessing gender are ridiculed, outcast, and forced to undergo \"psychotectic therapy\" - a form of therapy meant to remediate gender-specificity and allow acceptance back into J'naii society.\n\nThe affair between Riker and Soren grows and eventually is discovered. Soren is essentially put on trial where she passionately defends herself and expresses her outrage at what their society does to those who are different, before which Riker barges in and tries to take the blame for the situation without success. J'naii diplomats force Soren to undergo this therapy, citing reformed citizens' newfound happiness and desire to be normal. Riker's emotions and love for Soren grow and he decides that he cannot leave Soren to this fate. He tries to explain the situation to Picard, who is sympathetic to Riker but says that he cannot sanction a rescue mission as it violates the Prime Directive, not to mention Riker throwing away his career. Worf visits Riker in his quarters and offers to go with him on an \"unannounced visit\" to rescue Soren, since he is unwilling to let Riker face the task alone. When Riker and Worf beam down to the planet to rescue Soren, he realizes that the therapy has already been performed. Soren refuses to go with him, claiming that she is now happy and was sick during her affair with Riker. Soren apologizes to Riker, who returns to the Enterprise with Worf.\n\nThis episode was intended to address the contemporary issue of LGBT rights. Before he died, franchise creator Gene Roddenberry had expressed support for having LGBT characters being written onto the series. While no such characters were officially included, this episode was designed to comment on sexual identity-based prejudice.\n\nThe episode was met with both praise and criticism from the LGBT community. In the case of the latter, criticism came from people who felt that it sanctioned the brainwashing therapy to which Soren was subjected, and others who felt that the creative staff abdicated their responsibility to explore the issue. Actor Jonathan Frakes, who played Riker, also commented that the episode was not daring enough, in that Soren, who was played by Melinda Culea, should have been more evidently male.\n\nIn 2017, \"Den of Geek\" ranked this episode as one of top 25 \"must watch\" episodes of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2039364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2039364", "title": "Rogiet", "text": "Rogiet\n\nRogiet () is a small village and community (and electoral ward) in Monmouthshire, south east Wales, between Caldicot and Magor, west of Chepstow and east of Newport, which covers an area of . It lies close to the M4 and M48 motorways, and the Second Severn Crossing. It has a railway station named Severn Tunnel Junction. Rogiet only has a population of 1,813 (2011).\n\nIn the village is Rogiet Primary School, a 210-place school for pupils aged between 4 and 11 years. The school moved to a new, eco-friendly building in November 2009.\n\nThe village adjoins the Caldicot Levels. Its name is of uncertain derivation, and was formerly spelled \"Roggiatt\", \"Roggiett\" or \"Roggiet\". The first known lord of the manor was Godfrey de Gamage, who married Joan, the daughter of Richard de Clare, Earl of Pembroke, known as \"Strongbow\", in the 12th century.\n\nThe Church of St Mary, Rogiet is the parish church, which in earlier centuries was dedicated to St. Hilary. Much of the church dates from about the 14th century, and it was restored in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nThe South Wales Railway, now the Gloucester to Newport line, was opened through Rogiet in 1850, although the nearest station was two miles away, at Portskewett.\n\nA junction station was built at Rogiet to serve the new Severn Tunnel, that opened in 1886. This \"Severn Tunnel Junction\" station was in operation for tunnel works traffic by 1883 and as a functional station by 1885 although it is unclear if it was open to the public at this date, before the official opening of the tunnel in 1886. The sidings of the new station were built on the Caldicot Levels, using spoil excavated from the cutting into the tunnel. The name 'Rogiet Station' appears on several contemporary maps, although these are always in conjunction with a \"planned\" station, as the junction for the new tunnel line. There is no evidence for a station before this date, or for a constructed station ever having been called 'Rogiet Station'.\n\nThe station developed an importance out of all proportion to the size of the village, owing to the South Wales coal traffic and the large marshalling yard, the largest and most important on the GWR. This in turn required engine sheds of proportionate size, housing around 70 engines in 1939.\nThe presence of the station became a catalyst for the growth of the village. The censuses of 1851, 1861 & 1871 show the main employment to be agricultural, with a few working in the limestone quarries at Ifton, but no railway workers. The parish population increased from 84 in 1881 to 122 in 1891. The first new building was the construction of red-brick bookend terraces: Ifton Terrace, Railway Terrace and Seaview Terrace, all still extant today. These were followed by the village's only building of note, other than the church, its only pub the \"Roggiett Hotel\". This was a relatively large pub for such a small village, and operated as an active hotel, mostly serving the farming trade at the cattle market. It has been closed since 2008, leaving the village without a pub. A school was also built and by 1891 a post office had opened.\n\nA major phase of housing expansion took place after World War I, increasing by three times to World War II. Half of this growth, 94 houses, was due to the \"Severn Tunnel Garden Village Society\", constituted in 1924, whose membership was limited to railwaymen. Population increased from 136 in 1921 to 234 in the 1931 census. Many railwaymen still commuted from the other local villages though, and over a thousand worked at Severn Tunnel Junction by the outbreak of World War II.\n\nThe rapid rate of growth decreased after the war, and population only increased from 1,137 in 1951 to 1,347 in 1971. This was particularly affected by the withdrawal of steam power on the railway in the 1960s, and the resultant reduction in the staff needed at the locomotive sheds. Some of the younger railwaymen found employment at the expanding Llanwern steelworks. Many of the older railwaymen retired, encouraged by security of tenancy for the desirable Garden Village housing. This gave Rogiet a population in 1966 that consisted of 40% retirees, with an unusually elderly population in the 1960s and 1970s, leading in turn to an low provision of schools and other amenities, although a thriving allotment society continues to this day. The local birthrate fell by over 50% in the 15 years from 1946 to the 1961 census.\n\nThe village underwent major expansion in the later 20th century, following the development of nearby Caldicot, Undy and Magor as dormitory villages. With the development of the Severn Bridges, the number of commuters by road to Bristol also increased.\n\nThe land occupied by half of the old marshalling yard, to the West of the road across it, is now a countryside park.\n\nRogiet community's population was 1,813, according to the 2011 census; an 11.91% increase since the 1,620 people noted in 2001.\n\nThe 2011 census showed 15.6% of the population could speak Welsh, the highest percentage in Monmouthshire, a rise from 10.7% in 2001.\n\nRogiet is also the name of the electoral ward, coterminous with the community, which elects a county councillor to Monmouthshire County Council.\n\nSince 2008 the ward has been represented by Liberal Democrat, Linda Guppy. Her father, Gerald Robbins, had been an Independent county councillor for Rogiet until the 2004 elections. Between 2004 and 2008 the ward was represented by the Labour Party.\n\nIn 1998, a large hoard of Roman coins was found which became known as the Rogiet Hoard.\n\nThe hamlet and separate parish of Llanfihangel Rogiet (\"Welsh\": Llanfihangel Rhosied) is located immediately west of Rogiet itself, and derives its name from the Welsh name for the church of St. Michael (\"Llan\"-\"f/mihangel\"). It was established before the Norman invasion, but the current Church of St Michael and All Angels again dates from about the 14th century, with much later rebuilding, and contains medieval tombs. Unlike Rogiet, Llanfihangel has remained relatively untouched by modern development.\n\nThe land immediately east of Rogiet once formed the separate small parish of Ifton. Some Roman pottery was discovered at Ifton Manor. The church was pulled down in 1755.\n\n"}

The average enrollment is 570 students with an average Upper School grade/class size of 98 students. The average classroom size is 14 students.\n\nNichols School was founded in 1892 by William Nichols. The school was founded as an all-boys school with its campus on Amherst Street in North Buffalo. After many years of remaining an all boys school, it joined with Nottingham Academy, an all-girls school, becoming a co-ed Middle and Upper School. The Upper School was located on the original campus, and the Middle School was located on Nottingham Terrace. In 2001, a new Middle School building was constructed on the main campus, attaching itself to an older building on campus. That building used to be home to the basketball court and swimming pool, which have been converted into the dance studio and music room, respectively. In addition to the new Middle School facility, two new gyms were built, with squash courts added to accommodate the school's squash team. In 2011, construction was finished on the new mathematics and science building, Center '63. This new building was built to replace Moot Hall, the old math and science building.\n\nNichols School is located on in North Buffalo, within walking distance of the Buffalo Zoo, Delaware Park, and the Albright-Knox Art Gallery. The Nichols campus includes seven separate buildings linked by tree-lined sidewalks and an indoor passageway. The campus consolidation project, completed in August 2001, joined the Middle and Upper school divisions. Each division has separate academic buildings, and shares dining, athletic, and performing arts facilities.\n\nStudents are from the general Buffalo area, commuting from as far as Southern Ontario, Batavia, New York, and Ellicottville, New York, an organic expansion of its traditional turf according to Director of Admissions Nina Barone.\n\n Nichols is accredited by the New York State Association of Independent Schools and the New York State Department of Education. It received national recognition in the Secondary School Recognition Program and Exemplary Private School Recognition Program. Nichols is a member of the National Association of Independent Schools.\n\nNichols, along with other local private schools (including Buffalo Seminary, Canisius High School, and Park School of Buffalo), does not administer Regents exams.\n\nOf the faculty at Nichols, 10% have doctoral degrees; 75% have master's degrees; and 14% of the faculty are Nichols graduates. Faculty have an average of 20 years of service and serve as student advisers, coaches, club advisers and mentors.\n\nThe Upper School conducts an extensive interscholastic athletic program. Most teams have tryouts, mandatory practices and matches after school hours and play in competitive leagues throughout Western New York and Canada.\n\nOffered Sports:\nFall:\nWinter:\nSpring:\n\nIntramural sports where anyone can join a team dominate in the Middle School. The number of teams is dictated by the level of interest, practices take place during the daily sports period, and most teams play other local middle schools.\n\nThe 480-seat Flickinger Performing Arts Center is the centerpiece of the performing arts department, while visual arts studios support course offerings in drawing, painting, sculpture, ceramics, photography, video and graphic art.\n\nThe arts are promoted as a serious course of study and the school requires that all students engage in some form of participation. Artistic achievement is highlighted not only in plays and exhibitions, but also in morning meetings, where students often share their talents with the rest of the school. Students are encouraged to use the arts as a vehicle through which to find their own voices. In addition to studying and performing the work of renowned artists, original student work is featured on the walls of every building on the campus and on the floorboards of every stage. Students have the opportunity to compose music, write plays, choreograph dances, make their own films or curate their own art opening.\n\nNichols School has four different exchange programs for upper school students: Costa Rica, Spain, France, and China. Nichols students host an international student for three weeks, and then travel abroad and stay with that student and their family for an average of three weeks. While abroad, students attend classes at the hosting institution and travel to historical and cultural sites of importance. Students can participate in more than one exchange: historically, many Spanish students travel to Costa Rica sophomore year and Spain in junior or senior year.\n\nNichols offers a variety of extracurricular clubs, activities, trips and community service opportunities to students.

{"id": "2039404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2039404", "title": "Plum Bun", "text": "Plum Bun\n\nPlum Bun: A Novel Without a Moral is a novel by Jessie Redmon Fauset first published in 1928. Written by an African-American woman who, during the 1920s, was for many years the literary editor of \"The Crisis\", it is often seen as an important contribution to the movement that has come to be known as the Harlem Renaissance.\n\nOvertly conventional through its employment of elements and techniques of traditional genres such as the romance or the fairy tale, \"Plum Bun\" at the same time transgresses these genres by its depiction, and critique, of racism, sexism and capitalism. The heroine, a young, light-skinned African-American woman called Angela Murray, leaves behind her past and passes for white in order to be able to attain fulfilment in life. Only after she has lived among white Americans does she find out that crossing the racial barrier is not enough for a woman like herself to realize her full potential. The detailed description of her coming of age makes \"Plum Bun\" a classic \"Bildungsroman\".\n\n\"Plum Bun\", Fauset's second novel, was difficult to place; her first publisher Boni & Liveright, declined to publish it. Her agency, Brandt & Brandt eventually placed the book at the British publisher Charles Elkin Matthews in 1928, and Frederick A. Stokes published the US edition in 1929. The title, \"Plum Bun\", illustrates some of the forces which drive the novel's main character Angela Murray. The novel's epigraph quotes the nursery rhyme from which the title is taken: \"To market, to market / to buy a plum bun / Home again, home again / Market is done\". A plum bun itself, which may be similar to the English Chelsea Roll and the American Cinnamon Roll, is a sweet pastry made of white flour, in which deeply colored currents, raisins, or prunes (plums) are baked. The use of the term \"plum bun\" is also a sexual innuendo as a plum bun can also be read as \"an attractive piece\".\n\nAngela must come to grips with her colored and white racial heritage, as well as with her femininity (stereotypically seen as sweetness), before she achieves psychological wholeness. Although African-American women were typed in popular song as \"a little brown sugar\" or a \"jellyroll\", Angela had to cease thinking of herself as a purveyor of feminine sweetness for sale, and instead step into new roles with inherent value.\n\nThe novel's plot and characters include many autobiographical elements. In Fauset's actual family was part of the Philadelphia black middle class, and although well-respected and well-connected in the African-American community, they were prohibited from public places such as hospitals, restaurants and stores by widely accepted Jim Crow policies. Other autobiographical elements include growing up in a suburb of Philadelphia, being the only African-American student in a white school, and discovering Philadelphia's racist policies for hiring public school teachers (a black teacher could not teach white students). Fauset, like her main characters, moved to Harlem during the peak of the Harlem Renaissance (in 1919) and heard W. E. B. du Bois (in the novel he is named Van Meier) speak.\n\nThe novel's plot concerns two sisters, Virginia and Angela Murray, who grow up in Philadelphia in a home rich with African-American culture. Angela, like her mother Mattie, is light skinned and able to “pass” in white society, while Virginia and her father Junius's darker complexion places them on the other side of the color line. Virginia grows up refusing to bow to racist pressures; rather she accepts who she is. Angela, on the other hand, tries repeatedly to gain acceptance by assuming a white mask, but each time it seems that success and friendship are hers, her ethnicity is exposed and she is stripped of everything she cares about.\n\nThe deaths of her parents and the racism of Philadelphia society cause Angela to leave for New York City, where she decides to fully hide her African-American heritage. She gains acceptance in an elite artistic circle perhaps inspired by the 1920s Greenwich Village avant-garde. She begins a romantic relationship with Roger, a young white man who seems to move among New York's \"Four Hundred\", the social elite. Their relationship, however, is based in several deceptions. In one of the novel's most important scenes, Angela's sister is newly arrived at Pennsylvania Station from Philadelphia. Angela, who has come to the station to meet her sister, sees her lover. Aware that his racism will cause him to reject her, she brushes by her darker-complected sister, leaving her standing alone in the crowd. Angela's and Roger's deceptions of each other and of themselves lie also in their use of each other for personal gain: Angela seeks Roger's financial comfort; Roger seeks the convenience of sex without having to introduce his new find to his father, whose deep concern is for his future daughter-in-law's pedigree. Roger's abandonment of Angela, the unmasking, to Angela, of his solely sexual intentions, and the mistreatment of Miss Powell, a young artist of African-American heritage, lead Angela to reveal her racial heritage and lose her standing with several of her acquaintances. However, true friends and her sister urge her to travel to Paris to become an artist, and Anthony, a fellow art school classmate of mixed heritage who watched his father die under the hands of a racist mob in the South, declares his love for Angela. It seems at the end, Anthony and Angela may come to terms with America's racist past and their own brighter future.\n\nThe subtitle of the book, \"A Novel without a Moral\", can be understood as follows: once Angela leaves Philadelphia for New York and a traditional African-American home for life on her own, her morality is no longer clearly defined for her. The “moral to the story” is slowly created for the reader and for the main characters as Angela learns and understands the life lessons that New York affords her.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2039413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2039413", "title": "Southern Association", "text": "Southern Association\n\nThe Southern Association was a higher-level minor league in American organized baseball from 1901 through 1961. For most of its existence, the Southern Association was two steps below the Major Leagues; it was graded Class A (1902–1935), Class A1 (1936–1945) and Class AA (1946–1961). Although the SA was known as the Southern League through 1919, today's Double-A Southern League is not descended from the Southern Association; the modern SL came into existence in 1964 as the successor to the original \"South Atlantic\" (\"Sally\") League.\n\nA stable, eight-team loop, the Southern Association's member teams typically included the Atlanta Crackers, Birmingham Barons, Chattanooga Lookouts, Little Rock Travelers, Memphis Chicks, Nashville Vols, and New Orleans Pelicans. Either the Knoxville Smokies, Mobile Bears, or Shreveport Sports typically comprised the eighth club.\n\nThe association was formed from the remnants of the 1885–1899 Southern League by Abner Powell, Newt Fisher, and Charley Frank.\n\nAfter Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in 1946 with the Montreal Royals of the International League, the Southern Association continued to adhere to the Jim Crow segregation laws of the time. Only one African-American ever played a meaningful game during this time: Nat Peeples of the 1954 Atlanta Crackers, the only black player in the league's history. On April 9–10, 1954, Peeples played in two road games in Mobile, and went hitless in four at bats. He was demoted to the already-integrated, Single-A Jacksonville Braves of the Sally League before the Crackers played a home game.\n\nThe Southern Association then played the rest of its history, through the end of 1961, as a racially segregated league. Partly due to this, its Major-League parent clubs were among the last to integrate during the 1950s, a period when African-Americans and Latin-American players of African descent were beginning to dominate Major League Baseball. By the end of the 1950s, the SA was the target of a boycott by activists of the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nIn its last three years, the Southern Association was plagued by frequent franchise shifts. Little Rock moved to Shreveport after the 1958 season, and New Orleans moved to Little Rock after the 1959 season. Memphis' park burned down just before the 1960 season, forcing the Chicks to play in several temporary facilities before moving to Macon, Georgia for 1961. The league finally ceased operation after the 1961 season.\n\nMember cities slowly began to join remaining leagues, which were racially integrated. The Atlanta club moved up to the Triple-A International League in 1962. Little Rock followed suit (as the renamed Arkansas Travelers), moving to the International circuit in 1963 and the Pacific Coast League in 1964–1965, before making a permanent home in the Double-A Texas League in 1966. Macon, a longtime member of the Sally League, returned to that circuit in 1962. After a one-year hiatus, Nashville and Chattanooga joined the Sally League in 1963. Later in the decade, Birmingham (1964) and Mobile (1966) joined the Southern League, and Memphis and Shreveport (both in 1968) would enter the Texas circuit.\n\n\nWhile a league pennant winner was crowned each season, some seasons (1928 and 1932–61) also concluded with either the top two or four teams in the league competing in playoffs to determine a league champion. These playoffs varied between being best-of-five and best-of-seven contests. The Atlanta Crackers, termed by some the \"New York Yankees of the minors,\" won the Southern Association pennant 13 times, the most among all teams. They are followed by the New Orleans Pelicans, with nine pennants. As far as playoff championships are concerned, the Nashville Vols captured the most, with nine—dominating the league with six straight championships from 1939 to 1944. They are followed by Atlanta, with six playoff titles. Combining both pennants and playoffs, the Crackers won the most (21), with the Vols trailing them with 17. On the other hand, the Chattanooga Lookouts, charter members of the association, won only one title during their 54 years in the league—with that coming during the Southern Association's final, 1961 campaign.\n\nThe Southern Association gave a most valuable player award to the most outstanding player in the league from 1937 to 1957. In 1937, Coaker Triplett won the first ever Southern Association Most Valuable Player Award. Stan Palys won the final award in 1957.\n\n"}

In the ensuing few years he became renowned as a leading tactician in the one-day form of county cricket, leading Gloucestershire to 4 one day knockout cups in 6 years.\n\nIn 2001, however, his performances fell away somewhat, especially with the bat, and Alleyne relinquished the captaincy to Chris Taylor in 2004. Indeed, he played just four county matches that year and did not make his first appearance in 2005 until 10 June.\n\nHe replaced Jack Russell as captain in 1997, and on the 1998/99 tour of Australia made his England debut at Brisbane.\n\nIn February 2020, he was named in England's squad for the Over-50s Cricket World Cup in South Africa.

Charges were dropped.\n\nMesereau was the second lawyer during pre-trial proceedings in actor Robert Blake's case over the murder of his wife Bonnie Lee Bakley. Blake's first attorney Harland Braun resigned over Blake's decision to appear in a televised interview with Diane Sawyer against Braun's advice and counsel. For unprofessional conduct during the deposition, Mesereau was fined $18,950. After losing his appeal of the fine, he paid a total of $22,000. After Blake had spent ten months in isolation in Los Angeles County Jail, Mesereau obtained bail for him. Mesereau cross-examined prosecution witnesses in a three-week, televised preliminary hearing. The hearing revealed flaws in the prosecution's case. Mesereau resigned from the case, declining to explain why.\n\nIn 2004, Mesereau and Susan Yu were hired to replace attorneys Mark Geragos and Ben Brafman as lead trial counsel. Johnnie Cochran, who had represented Jackson during earlier molestation accusations, had recommended Mesereau to Jackson's family. In an unusual pretrial hearing, Mesereau called Santa Barbara County District Attorney Thomas Sneddon to the witness stand and examined him under oath. Mesereau and Yu were the lead trial lawyers in the case. The trial lasted from January to June 2005 and ended with Jackson acquitted of all 14 charges against him. Mesereau said that he never expected Michael Jackson to be convicted on any count, felony or misdemeanor. \"I believed, and still do, that he was completely innocent of these false charges\". Mesereau also cited the prosecution as a travesty of justice and one of the most mean-spirited attacks on an innocent person in legal history. Mesereau attended Jackson's funeral service and interment in 2009.\n\nIn 2019, followed by the release of the documentary Leaving Neverland, Mesereau defended Jackson once again.\n\nIn 2009, Thomas Mesereau and Susan Yu defended Joe Babajian in a high-profile mortgage fraud criminal trial in federal court in Los Angeles. Babajian had been indicted by a federal grand jury for twenty-one felony counts, including criminal conspiracy, real estate fraud, bank fraud, loan fraud, and wire fraud. Federal prosecutors claimed Babajian participated in a scheme to inflate property values and submit fraudulent loan documents and false property appraisals.\n\nCalled the \"Realtor to the Stars\", Babajian was once the highest-grossing real estate agent in the United States. He had sold homes to Barbra Streisand, Bruce Willis, Warren Beatty, Lee Iacocca, Beyoncé, Victoria and David Beckham, Oscar De La Hoya, Nicolas Cage, and others.\n\nEight individuals pleaded guilty to being part of the conspiracy prior to trial. Three individuals, including Babajian, went to trial. On August 10, 2009, the jury returned his verdict. Babajian was not convicted on a single count. The jury acquitted Babajian of thirteen counts and hung on the remaining eight counts. The other two defendants were convicted.\n\nOn April 9, 2012, Thomas Mesereau and Susan Yu began jury selection in their defense of Claudia Haro, the ex-wife of Oscar-winning actor Joe Pesci. Haro was charged with conspiracy to murder and multiple counts of attempted murder. She was facing two consecutive life sentences.\n\nThe Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office claimed that Haro masterminded numerous attempts to murder her next husband, Garrett Warren, a stuntman who appeared in the movies \"Mission Impossible III\", \"Avatar\" and \"Iron Man 2\". The prosecution said Haro hired her brother, convicted drug dealer Manny Haro, and three others to murder Warren. During his divorce with Claudia Haro, Warren opened his front door and was shot four times, losing one eye.\n\nThe gunman, Jorge Hernandez, received life in prison in a separate trial. Haro's brother, the self-admitted middleman, also received life in prison. He agreed to testify against his sister. After the start of jury selection, Haro pleaded \"no contest\" to two counts of attempted murder with a sentence of twelve years, four months. With time already served in Los Angeles County Jail before being released on bail, Haro will serve approximately eight years in prison.\n\nOn May 30, 2015, Mesereau was retained by rap mogul Marion \"Suge\" Knight, founder of Death Row Records. His appearance prompted the judge to reschedule a hearing on a motion by Knight to dismiss murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run charges. On January 22, 2016, however, lawyer Stephen L. Schwartz replaced Mesereau as Knight's defense lawyer. Schwartz and colleague Thaddeus Culpepper were later replaced by criminal defense attorneys Antoine D. Williams, Jamal Tooson, and Jeremy Lessem on May 9, 2016 as well.\n\nOn August 22, 2017, comedian Bill Cosby's sexual assault retrial was postponed after it was announced that Cosby had hired Mesereau to represent him at his retrial. On April 26, 2018, a jury found Cosby guilty of felony sexual assault on all three counts. Each of the three counts carries a prison term of up to 10 years. On June 15, Cosby fired Mesereau, replacing him with attorney Joseph P. Green Jr.\n\nAlthough known for his celebrity cases, Mesereau is also an advocate for pro bono volunteer legal services. He has established a legal clinic in Los Angeles and accepts one capital murder case each year on behalf of a defendant in the Deep South who cannot afford representation.\n\nBarbara Walters named him one of the year's \"Ten Most Fascinating People\". \"GQ Magazine\" named him one of its \"Men of the Year\".\n\nHe has been named \"Criminal Defense Lawyer of the Year\" by the Criminal Courts Bar Association, Los Angeles and the Century City Bar Association, Los Angeles and has been listed as one of the \"One Hundred Most Influential Attorneys in California\" by the Los Angeles Daily Journal. Mesereau has also received the \"Humanitarian Award\" from the National Association of Blacks in Criminal Justice. Mesereau received a \"Community Service Award\" from Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.\n\nMesereau was educated at Harvard University (cum laude), the London School of Economics and the University of California, Hastings College of the Law.\n\n\n"}

Masterman School\n\nThe Julia Reynolds Masterman Laboratory and Demonstration School is a middle and secondary school located in Philadelphia. It is a magnet school, located in the Spring Garden neighborhood. Prior to 1958 the school building was used by the Philadelphia High School for Girls and the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places under that name in 1986.\n\nMasterman is ranked first in the School District of Philadelphia and in the state of Pennsylvania. It is considered one of the best college-preparatory public schools in the country. The school has twice been named a National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence. U.S. News & World Report ranked it as the top public school in Pennsylvania since 1996, and 51st in the nation in 2017. The acceptance rate for the middle school is approximately 7%. Acceptance for the high school is approximately 3%, making it one of the most difficult schools to get into in the country.\n\nThe Julia R. Masterman Laboratory and Demonstration School was established in September 1958 as an academic magnet school for elementary school students in grades 4, 5 and 6. A junior high school program was initiated in 1959, and a senior high school was added in 1976. In 1990 Masterman was re-organized as a middle school (grades 5-8) and a high school (grades 9-12). Masterman is located in the former Philadelphia High School for Girls building.\n\nStudents are admitted from all areas of Philadelphia based on academic performance, and staff members are selected based on professional expertise. The mission of the school is the pursuit of excellence in both teaching and learning. The high school is a preparatory school for select students of superior ability. \n\nThe school was named for Julia Reynolds Masterman, who was instrumental in establishing the Philadelphia Home and School Council and served as its first president. The Masterman family still participates in school events and contributes awards at commencement.\n\nIn 2007, Masterman was a filming location for the 2008 M. Night Shyamalan film \"The Happening\" starring Mark Wahlberg. The film shows interior shots of a science lab on the fourth floor, the auditorium, and the main corridor of the first floor hallway, along with various other shots of the school.\n\nIn 2010, President Barack Obama chose Masterman as the site of his second annual back-to-school speech, which was broadcast nationally. There, he spoke about how the core of America's future is represented by the students of this generation.\nIn 2014 Jessica Brown, a Masterman alumna who had previously worked as a principal intern there, became the school principal. The current vice principals are Michelle Harrison and Tonya Broussard.\n\nThe current dress code states that students must wear clothing which is appropriate, acceptable and not offensive in any way. Jeans are allowed, but cannot be ripped in inappropriate places. Flip-flops, crop-tops, and tank tops are not allowed. References to alcohol, illegal drugs, profanities, or slurs of any sort are not permitted on any personal property.\n\nBeginning in 2001 the School District of Philadelphia required all schools to enact school uniforms or strict dress codes. To comply with the district-wide policy, the administration of Masterman banned shirts with logos and emblems.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2039455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2039455", "title": "Warnings/Promises", "text": "Warnings/Promises\n\nWarnings/Promises is the fourth full-length studio album by the Scottish rock band, Idlewild, released on 7 March 2005, on Parlophone. The album marks the only appearance of bassist Gavin Fox, following the departure of Bob Fairfoull in 2002, and is the first album to feature touring guitarist Allan Stewart as a permanent member. During the recording of the album, Roddy Woomble described the process as feeling \"so different, in every way, than any of our other records,\" and cited that Idlewild felt like a \"new band\".\n\nThe album is a departure from the sound of their earlier material, blending contemporary folk influences with melodic rock. Mike Diver, from Drowned in Sound, described the album as \"\"the\" opinion-splitter in Idlewild's canon of work. It marked the final chapter in the group's relationship with Parlophone.\" Guitarist Rod Jones, stated that the album is \"more stripped back and direct\" than previous albums, and that it has a sense of \"frailty\" to it, while drummer, Colin Newton, noted that the album is \"not an immediate sounding record; in fact I can imagine it being quite difficult to get into at first. I think it fits together quite well, but there isn't anything that's instantly catchy like \"When I Argue I See Shapes\" or \"You Held the World in Your Arms\". Lyrically, Woomble describes the album as sounding like \"a series of public service announcements.\" Woomble credited Jones with influencing the sound of the band's previous album, \"The Remote Part\", but noted that \"Warnings/Promises\" \"had more of my influence on it, bringing it into roots and folksy territories.\"\n\nThe album entered the UK Album Chart at No. 9, and is currently certified as Silver in the UK, having sold over 60,000 copies. It was performed in full on 20 December 2008, at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut. The track 'Too Long Awake' features on the video game, Saints Row.\n\nFollowing a tour supporting Pearl Jam, and festival appearances in the UK, the band rented a house in the Scottish Highlands to begin writing the follow-up to \"The Remote Part\". In an online diary entry, Roddy Woomble stated that the first four months of 2004 were: spent in song writing frenzy, in various bedrooms, living rooms, and up in the frosty Highlands. Breaking up the chords and words with sporadic midnight rambles, wrapped up warm, drunk on wine, deep in dark woods. And playing table tennis in a cow shed. In a surreal twist the next three months were spent in Hollywood, California, turning these Highland folk songs into fully realised rockers.\n\nTo record the album, the band flew out to Los Angeles, and worked with producer Tony Hoffer. According to drummer Colin Newton, the band had been: taking our time recording the songs for the album and spent three months going backwards and forwards between studios in L.A., and a lot of the time we were too intent on having a good time rather than working hard, so eventually that’s why we had to go back out and re-record everything and we finally got it finished in October. Along the way as well, we’d been hearing that the record company had been having doubts about the songs on the album, so that final trip to L.A. seemed to be the re-awakening of us as a band.\n\nIn another online diary, during the recording of the album, Woomble commented on the different environments: We wrote these songs in a damp house overlooking Skye, surrounded by sheep, mud and the crazy Scottish sky, and listening to them driving through west Hollywood at midnight, looking out the window. It's like a different version of the same song.\n\nPrior to the recording sessions in Los Angeles, the band had begun recording in Sweden with producer Dave Eringa. Only one song from these sessions, \"I Understand It\", is included on the album.\n\nOn the DVD that accompanies \"Scottish Fiction - Best of 1997-2007\", there is a section titled \"The Making of Warnings/Promises\", which includes interviews with the band members and their thoughts on the album.\n\nThe album received mixed reviews, with a Metacritic score of 66, based on 20 reviews. NME gave the album a positive review, writing that \"where \"The Remote Part\" was their \"Green\"-esque lunge into the spotlight, \"Warnings/Promises\" is their full-blown \"Out of Time\" spectacular. But with less twangle, more teeth.\". On the other hand, Alternative Press claims that \"Idlewild undeniably sound like a once-great band helplessly slipping into their confusing middle years.\"\n\nFan reaction to the album was mixed, and the album remains hotly debated on forums.\n\nIn regards to the album's mixed reactions, Roddy Woomble believes that: a lot of people that criticised that album were younger people, people who liked specific things in our past. The record actually sold well, and found a new fan base amongst older people. Basically our audience changed and opened up, and I think a lot of younger people, who followed the band for a while, didn’t want to go to a gig with their mother and dad, yet suddenly there were people of their mother and dad’s age at our gigs. I think the culture we live in is obsessed with things that are young and fresh. It’s like music has a sell-by date or something, which is absurd: everyone knows sell-by dates were only invented so people don’t get sued.\n\nI don’t pay much attention to critics, though – if you did you’d never get out of bed, because you’d be so worried about what people thought of you. I think people that criticise need to get out more and go for a walk. I mean, what’s the point? If you don’t like it, you don’t like it. I think the good thing about the band now is that we’ve got a body of work – you don’t have to like all of it, it’s not a requirement. If you can take something from one or two records, that’s something.\n\n\n\n\"The following songs appear as interludes in the Scottish Fiction DVD:\"\n\nThe following people contributed to \"Warnings/Promises\":\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He published a number of books and spoke widely in universities and other venues across the country during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nRose developed a system which he described as the \"retreat from untruth,\" an examination of personal belief systems and lifestyles. In that system one discards what one finds to be false on a case-by-case basis. He believed a spiritual Ultimate truth exists and can be found for oneself with sufficient application of effort, and recommended skeptical approaches such as his.\n\nHe studied human psychology, human weakness and human potential, then wrote challenges to psychology, psychiatry, religion, academia, the legal system, and the New Age movement. His criticism included issues of group-think, dogmatism, financial motives, emotional appeals, and reliance on questionable authorities.\n\nRichard Rose was born in Benwood, West Virginia, USA. He entered a Catholic pre-seminary in Butler, Pennsylvania at age 12. He later recounted his delight at the prospect of living with monks and nuns who he believed had direct connections to God. He became disillusioned though with the teachers and with their insistence that he accept what they taught on blind faith. He left the seminary at age 17 still looking for God but having decided to do so through science. He then studied chemistry and physics in college but became disillusioned with the possibility of finding God or Truth through science. He then traveled around the U.S., in a series of jobs such as work on the first nuclear submarine at Babcock & Wilcox in Alliance, Ohio, on streptomycin at the National Jewish Medical & Research Center in Denver, and performing metallurgical testing for Martin Aircraft in Baltimore.\n\nWhile living in Baltimore, his older brother James was killed on a Merchant Marine vessel when it was torpedoed by a German U-boat. His death provided a huge shock to Rose, who contrasted his brother's selfless attitude to his own spiritual ego.\n\nRose was working in the spring of 1947 as a waiter at a tennis club in Seattle when he experienced what he described as \"God Realization\". Several months later, he wrote a description of what had occurred in \"The Three Books of the Absolute\".\n\nA few years later he married and raised a family. He supported the family as a painting contractor and by raising cattle on the family farm. He worked with people who were interested in parapsychological phenomena such as ESP and hypnosis, but said he never come across anyone working to answer questions about the nature of the mind and reality. It was in this period that he compiled his first book, \"The Albigen Papers\" published in 1973, outlining his philosophy.\n\nIn 1972 Rose was invited to give a talk at the Theosophical Society in Pittsburgh. Two students from the University of Pittsburgh attended, and they were inspired to start a group at the university to apply Rose's teaching. In 1973, Rose and a handful of students set up the TAT Foundation — \"a circle of friends with no head\" — to promote their efforts to reach out to others. The acronym TAT stood for \"Truth and Transmission.\" The Pittsburgh group spawned groups at other northeastern universities and even a couple of western locations (Denver and Los Angeles). Rose made his farm available for group gatherings and individual retreats, and students built two large buildings for meetings as well as cabins for individual use. The following two decades saw hundreds of people inspired to launch their own spiritual searches.\n\nRose continued to write and publish while his study groups expanded. His public lectures continued until the early 1990s, when he started to show signs of deterioration from Alzheimer's disease.\n\nRose's student David Gold described his work as esoteric and direct. Rose chose not to establish a popular movement of students, instead preferring a network of close students, who then reached out to a larger circle, which included author Joseph Chilton Pearce.\n\nHe came from humble roots, then studied as a scientist. His teachings were based on a lifetime of experience and research, and in particular an experience when he was thirty. Joseph Chilton Pearce described him: \"Rose is a no-nonsense West Virginian who wants nothing more from life than to somehow pass on the cataclysmic spiritual experience, the Enlightenment that blind-sided him when he was a young man.\"\n\nHis student John Kent felt Rose's teachings were difficult to describe, because Rose stressed inner work inherently subjective and intimate to each individual. They were more about pursuing personal insight and introspection than a set of specific techniques. Nonetheless, according to Kent, Rose did formulate a system of teachings based on his study of other traditions and his own insights. Kent summarized the core questions in the teachings as: \n\nRose recommends a deep investigation of \"who\" is living and experiencing: clearly defining self and ego. He also insisted that a life of activity is meaningless as long as the identity of the actor is not known. He thought approaching spirituality as a way to find peace or enhance one's life, which he called \"utilitarian,\" was foolish. Instead he advocated total dedication to a search for truth — in particular concerning self and ego — in spite of the personal consequences.\n\nHe used the term \"Jacob's Ladder\" (image) as a kind of transpersonal map. Based on that, he then used the terms \"Law of the Ladder\" and \"Ladder Work\" to describe different levels he observed among those seeking truth. He also believed that one could only effectively help, or be helped by, others who were on the same or adjacent rungs of the ladder. He felt \"extra-proportional returns\" were realized when a group of people combine their efforts in any endeavor, which he called the \"Contractor's Law\".\n\nRose cautioned against postulating what truth — with respect to self and ego, for example — should be and then trying to move toward it. Instead one removes misunderstandings. His working definition of truth was \"a condition from which all untruth has been removed.\" He used the phrases \"retreat from error\" and \"reverse vector\" to describe the process of moving away from the most obviously false, what he called \"garbage,\" which would clarify the thinking and intuition to a point where more subtle untruth could be evaluated.\n\nHe published \"The Albigen Papers\" in 1973, which he called a guidebook for seekers. His theories about the transmutation of energy from the body through the mind up to what he called the \"spiritual quantum,\" were published after that and similar to some recent theories describing the mind as a force-field. He produced a pamphlet on a method of meditation involving the dispassionate review of past traumatic events as a way to overcome psychological problems and to understand the ego. His book \"Psychology of the Observer\" encapsulated his views on the structure of mind-processes and what he described as the internal ascent from a personal, conflicted view of the world to a more Universal perspective.\n\nHe was a hypnotist, occasionally giving demonstrations, and said that understanding hypnotism was a key to understanding the mechanics of the mind. His criticism of spiritual and New Age movements often included references to their use of self-hypnotic methods.\n\nHis student John Kent described the culmination of Rose's philosophy as corresponding \"most closely with the nondualism of Advaita Vedanta\". But Kent also writes that rather than presenting a concept-structure or a specific practice upon which his teachings could be based Rose instead advocated personal immersion into available methods and religious styles while always applying what he called \"respectful doubt.\" Consequently, his followers obtained an understanding of a wide number of esoteric groups and methods, which they were able to bring back and share among themselves. Rose also believed that progress on one's spiritual path was linked to one's efforts at helping others.\n\nRose recommended a number of authors to his students and disparaged other authors, based on his research. Those he most highly recommended were Indian guru Ramana Maharshi, Chan master Huang Po, Christian mystics St. John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila, George Gurdjieff, and researchers Paul Brunton and Richard Bucke. In \"Albigen Papers\" he described H.P. Blavatsky's books as \"some of the most valuable a student can own,\" and in his publication of \"Profound Writings East & West\", called her text \"Book of Golden Precepts\" (also \"Voice of the Silence\") as \"a condensed guide to the deepest teachings of mankind.\" Rose advocated the study of what he called thaumaturgical laws as a means to protect oneself from unseen influences, for anyone who would explore the dimensions of consciousness (\"the mind dimension\"), referring to texts by Eliphas Levi and others.\n\nAccording to Kent, Rose advocated a very personal commitment similar to Gurdjieff and he discouraged casual commitment. Aspects of his style which discouraged casual commitment included: a Zen-like method of confrontation, recommending a celibate lifestyle, and strong criticism of what he described as social and political sacred cows. In personal interactions he would attempt to dispel illusions and falsehoods that students were hiding from themselves. This sharpness caused his students to call him a Zen master, even though he was highly critical of mainstream Zen. In fact, the first group established by Rose was called Zen Study Group, in Pittsburgh, reflecting his embrace of Zen methods, and other groups were called Pyramid Zen Society, an admission that those interested in total commitment would be few (the top of the pyramid) as explained in various recorded talks. He felt that requiring students to be determined would produce a more committed group of thinkers and researchers.\n\nRose gave a series of lectures in the 1970s which outlined his approach to Zen and which incorporated the term Zen in the title: \"The Psychology of Zen\"; \"Zen and Common Sense\"; \"Zen and Death\"; etc. Several of these have been transcribed from the audio tapes and published. He published for limited circulation a paper titled \"The Monitor Papers\" which established rules, guidelines and techniques to be observed during confrontation in the private group meetings where confrontation was permitted.\n\nRose had a high regard for Alfred Pulyan, a Zen teacher in Connecticut, who gave him a method of Transmission referred to in Zen literature. Rose wrote a handbook for local group leaders, \"The Monitor Papers\", currently unpublished, giving instructions on how to create \"rapport\", which in his view is a precursor to Transmission, and he published \"Energy Transmutation, Between-ness and Transmission\" in 1975.\n\nStemming from his investigations into Spiritualism, in his early lectures he often related his findings on paranormal phenomena.\n\nHe worked closely with groups, beginning with university students and professional people, mostly in the Northeast (e.g. Pennsylvania, Ohio, Massachusetts, Maryland, West Virginia). Over time, as the students graduated and entered professional lives, groups were also established in Colorado, California, North Carolina, Florida, and Maine. After he was hospitalized with Alzheimer's in the mid 1990s, many of the organizations failed, but some continued - notably, the Self Knowledge Symposium founded by August Turak at universities in North Carolina.\n\nHis followers believe he never pursued widespread popularity. Members of the TAT Foundation, the current umbrella organization, are dispersed geographically. People may attend study groups without becoming actual members of the umbrella group.\n\nIn 1967, Rose attempted to create an ashram of spiritual seekers on his Marshall County, West Virginia farm, and composed a letter which was published in the San Francisco Oracle expressing his desire to try \"to form an ashram of sorts here in West Virginia, in the rural section where I own about a half a section. The conception is one of a non-profit, non-interfering, non-denominational, retreat or refuge, where philosophers might come to work communally together, or independently,—where a library and other facilities might be developed.\",\n\nAmong the seekers who responded to his letter were Hare Krishna devotees Kirtanananda Swami (Keith Gordon Ham) and his partner Hayagriva Das (Howard Morton Wheeler). The two secured a 99-year lease on Rose's backwoods farm which eventually developed into the sprawling New Vrindaban Community which eventually included Prabhupada's Palace of Gold, and this community pressed against Rose's farm from all sides. When Rose attempted to fight the Krishnas in court and win back his land for non-payment of taxes, there was some talk at the community about \"eliminating\" him, and a hit man allegedly followed him for a while. Despite his troubles with the Krishnas, Rose reportedly never expressed outright regret over his decision to lease his back farm to them. \"In some ways the Krishnites are better to have around than the hillbillies,\" Rose said once. \"At least they don't get drunk and steal the radiators out of your trucks.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The U.S. Forest Service has designated it as a botanical area because of the unique aquatic and woodland plants that grow there. Exposed walls of 25-million-year-old (Miocene epoch) basalt are home to a wide variety of ferns, mosses, hepatics and lichens, many of which grow only in the Columbia River Gorge. Oneonta Gorge has been described as \"one of the true dramatic chasms in the state. \"\n\nThere are four major waterfalls on the Oneonta Creek as it runs through the gorge. Middle Oneonta Falls can be seen clearly from a footpath and is very often mistaken for the upper or lower falls. The lower gorge has been preserved as a natural habitat, so there is no boardwalk or footpath through it as such. Thus, Lower Oneonta Falls can only be seen by walking upstream from the creek's outlet at the Historic Columbia River Highway. To get to a vantage point where the entire lower falls is visible can require wading through water that in some places can be chest-deep, depending on the season and the relative amount of snow-melt. The upper falls are about 1 mile upstream from the middle falls and require scrambling up the creek or climbing down a canyon wall to view. The fourth falls which is \"Triple falls\" can be seen from a vantage point on the upper trails in the canyon.\n\nThe trail has some issues due to some natural as well as human impacts. In the late 1990s, the stream was partially occluded when three large boulders tumbled into the stream. Subsequently, a log jam has formed along the trail. This has created a hazard for hikers, which led to a fatality in 2011.\n\nAs of July 2019 trails providing access to the waterfalls are still closed due to damage from the 2017 Eagle Creek Fire.\n\nThe Oneonta Gorge was first photographed by Carleton Eugene Watkins, a native of Oneonta, New York, who had traveled west during the time of California Gold Rush of 1849. Watkins named the Oneonta Falls after his hometown.\n\n"}

After losing the 2018 election, the party has been split into two factions – one led by Maglin Dennis D'Cruz who supported myPPP remaining part of the BN coalition and the other led by party president M. Kayveas who insisted on myPPP leaving the BN coalition. The latter emerged victorious in the immediate power struggle and myPPP subsequently exited the Barisan Nasional coalition. The Registrar of Societies (RoS) has deregistered MyPPP, which is facing leadership problems, effective Jan 14, 2019.\n\nPPP was formed in 1953 by the Seenivasagam brothers mainly as an opposition party to the Alliance; the party's first president was Kanagaratnam Pillai with the Seenivasagam brothers as office bearers. It was hugely popular party upon inception, particularly due to the popularity of the brothers who spoke up for justice, equality and the common man.\n\nFor a short period in 1954, PPP joined the ruling Alliance with UMNO, MIC, and MCA (which would later become the Barisan Nasional), but withdrew in 1955 over disagreement with the Alliance on allocation of seats, to become an opposition party again. In 1969, as a strong opposition party, PPP was nearly able to form the Perak State Government, but fell short of just 2 seats in combination with the opposition to form the state assembly when 2 of its members crossed over. The success of PPP was mainly due to the Chinese vote, though many of the top leaders then were Indians.\n\nIn 1973, PPP became one of the founding members of the National Front. It was brought into the National Front to keep the Indian and Chinese vote, especially after the 1969 racial riots.\n\nHowever, joining the coalition would prove its undoing as it lost nearly all its seats when it contested under the Barisan Nasional ticket in the 1974 General Elections. This was mainly due to Chinese anti-establishment feeling that was prevailing at that time.\n\nToday, under the leadership of M. Kayveas, the PPP has a membership of more than 500,000 with a network of over 3000 branches throughout the country. All registered members carry a membership card signed by the President; the President's card is signed by the Secretary General. As of 2006, 48% of the PPP's membership is Indian, 32% are Chinese, 13% are Malay, and the rest are of other ethnicities.\n\nIn November 2006, party president, M. Kayveas, proposed a merger between the PPP and another Barisan Nasional party, the Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia (GERAKAN). Koh Tsu Koon, Gerakan's Deputy President, welcomed the suggestion.\n\nThe 2008 Malaysian General Elections saw the party being decimated. However the party retained its representation in the Senate and was later allocated a Deputy Minister post occupied by T. Murugiah.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2018 Malaysian General Elections, the party under President M. Kayveas announced myPPP's exit from the Barisan Nasional coalition after its loss of power in the election. There was a subsequent power struggle between the \"remain\" and \"leave\" factions of myPPP led by Maglin Dennis D'Cruz and M. Kayveas respectively. The latter emerged victorious in the power struggle and the attempted usurpers were stripped of their party membership and expelled. \n\n\n\n"}

The SUPP president is Dr. Sim Kui Hian. He succeeded the post from his predecessor, Peter Chin Fah Kui in 2014. Established in 1959, SUPP is the first political party in Sarawak. It has its roots in left-leaning ideologies, nationalism and championing for the cause of the working class. Formerly it was one of the Sarawak component members of Barisan Nasional (BN) from 1970 until June 2018. Together with other Sarawak-based BN component parties, SUPP always has had tension in its relationship with its Peninsula-based partners. After the 2018 general election defeat of BN had proven that the model was no longer viable, and following a key meeting between all Sarawak-based BN coalition parties on 12 June 2018, SUPP has decided to leave BN to co-form a new Sarawak-based coalition of Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS).\n\nBeing the first local political party, Sarawak United Peoples' Party (SUPP's) origins are tied to Sarawak's history of 20th century political awakening. After World War II, the last Rajah of Sarawak, Charles Vyner Brooke ceded Sarawak to Britain in 1946, thus making it an official British Crown Colony – to the dismay of many locals. This eventually gave rise to local anti-cession and anti-imperialist movements which further sparked local political awareness. The triggering event was Sarawak's new Constitution of 1959 which fell short of expectations for many who hoped to see significant progress to self-governance. The need for an organised political front to champion Sarawakian interests finally led to the formation of SUPP on 4 June 1959, with Ong Kee Hui as its founding president. With a \"Sarawak for Sarawakians\" ideology – SUPP's movement gained widespread support, including winning big in the local elections of November 1959, alarming the then ruling British colonial government. When the proposal for Federation of Malaysia was first mooted in 1961, SUPP came out strongly to oppose the idea. Ong argued for Sarawak's independence before setting up a greater federation.\n\nIn December 1962, the British colonial government launched a crackdown on all dissenting groups in Sarawak. Many party members were detained, some even deported from Sarawak for alleged communist activities as, at the time, some members had links with Communist-affiliated organisations. Nonetheless, SUPP still did well at the Sarawak elections of June 1963 but it left one-seat-short of a majority to form government, thus it remained as the opposition party. On 22 July 1963, Sarawak gained independent self-governance from Britain. On 16 September, Sarawak together with the Federation of Malaya, Singapore and North Borneo (Sabah) jointly founded the Federation of Malaysia. In June 1965, the government launched “Operation Hammer” to counter prevailing communist threats. Party leaders vehemently protested when about 10,000 Sarawakians men, women and children were forced to resettle under curfew – surrounded by barb-wire fencing – including more than a hundred SUPP members. Party leaders initiated daily visits to the resettlement centres to monitor the welfare of the detainees, but later, even this was barred by the government.\n\nIn May 1969, due to 13 May riots in Peninsular Malaysia, an Emergency Proclamation was declared across the country, suspending an ongoing elections in Sarawak. When the Sarawak elections resumed in 1970, SUPP emerged as the single party with largest number of votes, but no party has control of majority seats to form a government. Considering that this crisis for a functioning government occurred at a time when, on one hand, a state of turmoil post-13 May was still present, while on the other hand, people were rounded-up and detained without trial – SUPP accepted the invitation to form a coalition government to stabilise the situation. In exchange, the government agreed to SUPP demand that party secretary-general Stephen Yong be appointed to the State Operations Committee (the security directorate) so that the party can influence counter-insurgency operations to look after the welfare of SUPP detainees including Chinese settlers, in the resettlement centres. In the ensuing years, SUPP generally had wide support at the polls even during the 2008 Malaysian general election where most of its allies suffered.\n\nHowever, it is no stranger to major setbacks at the polls: In the 1996 Sarawak election, its then president, the late Wong Soon Kai was defeated and thereafter decided to retire from politics. A similar situation happened in 2011 Sarawak election when the then party president, George Chan Hong Nam was unseated. It also lost at the Sibu by-election of 2010. In the 2013 Malaysian general election, the party won only 1 out of 7 seats contested. Not long after, Wong Soon Koh, who was then the deputy secretary-general, left with his faction and eventually set up a separate splinter-party with a similar-sounding name, called United People's Party (UPP).\n\nA positive turnaround was marked in the 2016 Sarawak election when SUPP, with current party president Sim Kui Hian at the helm, went on to win 7 seats out of 15 contested. After establishing new leadership line-up and reforms including amending the party constitution to limit the tenure of the president himself, the party placed renewed focus on the pursuit of more Sarawakian autonomous power and rights within Malaysia based on the unique contexts of the federation's formation, as originally outlined in the Malaysia Agreement 1963, Inter-Governmental Committee Report, and the Report of the Cobbold Commission.\n\n\nSarawak State Legislative Assembly\n\n\n"}

It was registered on 21 January 1994 by dissidents led by former Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Yong Teck Lee from United Sabah Party (PBS). Formerly a component party in the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, SAPP officially withdrew from BN in September 2008 to become independent. As of 2010, SAPP has two representatives in the national legislature and two in the Sabah State Assembly. In 2016, the party together with Homeland Solidarity Party (STAR) formed the United Sabah Alliance (USA). It later joined the United Alliance together with STAR.\n\nThe SAPP won two parliamentary seats in the general election held on 8 March 2008. After the 2008 election, there were calls by many Sabahan political parties for more autonomy from the Malaysian federal government.\n\nSAPP President Yong Teck Lee announced on 18 June 2008 that the party would file a \"no-confidence motion\" in the \"Dewan Rakyat\" on 23 June against Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, calling on him to step down. The party, criticising what it described as insensitivity on the part of the government towards issues in Sabah, said that it was taking advantage of a unique \"window of opportunity\" for the sake of Sabah interests, including autonomy, return of Labuan and 20% of oil revenues. The majority of the Sabah population are generally content with the SAPP no-confidence vote against Prime Minister Abdullah who has been accused a number of wrongdoings including corruption and abuse of power. In retaliation for calling for a vote of no-confidence against Abdullah, the BN supreme council issued a show-cause letter to SAPP. A 30-day period was to give SAPP a chance to reply and defend itself before BN took any action against them.\n\nOn 17 September 2008, SAPP quit Barisan Nasional. Nevertheless, the decision came at a price as the party's deputy president, one of its vice-presidents, and its youth chief (who chose to remain within BN) all opposed the move and withdrew from the party. Some 2,000 members of the party similarly disagreed from the move and left the party, showing support for these dissident leaders.\n\nIn 2016, the party formed a part of the United Sabah Alliance (USA).\n\n"}

It was allocated one parliamentary seat under the Barisan Nasional (BN) political alliance, the Sandakan seat. The seat which was won by the party's then president, Liew Vui Keong in the 2008 general election was lost in the 2013 general election to a candidate from the Democratic Action Party (DAP). As a result, the party is currently not represented in the Dewan Rakyat and Sabah State Legislative Assembly. On 11 May 2018, Liberal Democratic Party announced that they have decide to pulling out from the BN coalition with immediate effect.\n\nThe Liberal Democratic Party was formed in 1989 during the era when Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS), then a federal opposition party, was the state government of Sabah. The formation of LDP then was seen more as \"a storm in a teacup\" as the existence of Sabah People's United Front (BERJAYA), United Sabah National Organisation (USNO) and the Sabah Chinese Party (SCP) had posed a larger challenge to the mighty PBS then as LDP was a small party.\n\nLDP contested the 1990 Sabah State Election and fielded 14 candidates but lost all the seats it contested. PBS won 44 seats out of the 48 State Constituencies it contested in the election. Despite LDP's defeat in the 1990 State Election, in 1991, LDP was admitted into the fold of BN as its first Chinese-based political party in Sabah. Chong Kah Kiat became the president then and had since replaced Pro tem President Hiew Ming Kong as the President of LDP. \n\nAs the United Malay National Organisation (UMNO) was introduced into Sabah to fight PBS, other BN political parties in Sabah who had contested in the 1990 State Election like BERJAYA and USNO were forced to disband and disappeared from the political scene altogether. Under the Barisan ticket, LDP was allocated three seats, Tenom, Kudat and Sembulan. LDP's candidate won the Kudat seat while lost the other two to the PBS's candidate. The aftermath of the 1994 State Election saw many state elected representatives switching their political parties. This resulted in the collapse of PBS and the emergence of Sabah UMNO which went on to form the next government. The new State Government of Sabah included LDP's sole representative, Kong Hong Ming, into the Sabah Cabinet. In 1995, LDP president Chong Kah Kiat was picked as a senator to the Dewan Negara. However, later, Chong was challenged for the presidency by Kong. Chong eventually emerged as the winner and Kong left the LDP, quitting his ministerial post from the Sabah cabinet. \n\nChong continued as a Federal Minister in the Prime Minister's Department from 1995 till 1999 when he resigned to return to state politics. LDP was allocated two State Constituencies seats for the 1999 State Election namely Kudat and Karamunting where the candidates are Wong Lien Tat, the Party's Vice-President and Chong himself. They eventually won both seats handsomely. Both were made ministers in the state cabinet.\n\nLDP reached its political peak when Chong became the 13th Chief Minister of Sabah under the Rotation System introduced by the then Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad in 2001. Chong Kah Kiat became Chief Minister for two years till 2003 before the post went back to UMNO and the post was never again rotated as in the 2004 Sabah state election, BN swept 59 out of the 60 state seats. LDP won all the three state seats it was allocated under the BN ticket. Despite this, LDP lost the Sandakan parliamentary seat to an independent candidate who had the backing of Sabah Progressive Party (SAPP). In 2005, Liew Vui Keong was appointed as the party's Secretary General.\n\nIn 2006, Chong Kah Kiat decided to retire as party president. Liew Vui Keong and Chin Su Phin then took over as the Party President and Deputy President posts respectively. Teo Chee Kang was appointed Secretary General. Chong Kah Kiat, however, did not retire from politics as he remained as the State's Deputy Chief Minister cum Minister of Tourism, Culture and Environment. On 13 April 2007, Chong Kah Kiat resigned from the State Cabinet due to his differences with the Chief Minister Musa Aman over the State Government's stoppage order for the construction of a Mazu statue which was undertaken by the Kudat Thean Hou Charitable Foundation in Kudat. Chong resignation from the state cabinet completes his exit in politics.\n\nIn the 2008 Sabah state election, all new faces were fielded in the three state seats allocated to LDP. LDP won all three seats comfortably as BN swept 61 seats out of the 62 state seats. Secretary general Teo Chee Kang won the Tanjong Kapor seat which was previously held by Chong Kah Kiat. New LDP President Liew Vui Keong also won the Sandakan Parliamentary seat and was subsequently appointed Deputy Minister of Trade and Industries. After the SAPP announced it would quit BN on 17 September 2008, its quota of Sabah's Deputy Chief Minister was handed over to LDP. Deputy President Chin Su Phin suggested that the party's three assemblymen were too young-and-inexperienced and therefore not ready to take up such a senior position and instead recommended Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) for the post citing that it is the largest Chinese-based BN component party. In spite of that, first term assemblyman Peter Pang was appointed to the post by the Chief Minister Musa. Pang was chosen because compared to the other two LDP assemblymen, Teo Chee Kang (Tanjung Kapor) and Pang Yuk Ming (Merotai), Pang is not closely aligned to Chong Kah Kiat. In September 2010, LDP lost its representation in the state cabinet when Peter Pang left the LDP. In March 2011, Peter Pang applied to join Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia (GERAKAN). Peter Pang was later stripped off his position as Deputy Chief Minister, with the position eventually going to senior state assemblyman Yee Moh Chai of the PBS. Few days after the 2018 general election, the party left the defeated BN coalition.\n\n\n\n"}

It hardens and blackens when cool, and the niello on the flat surface is polished off to show the filled lines in black, contrasting with the polished metal (usually silver) around it. It may also be used with other metalworking techniques to cover larger areas, as seen in the sky in the diptych illustrated here. The metal where niello is to be placed is often roughened to provide a key. In many cases, especially in objects that have been buried underground, where the niello is now lost, the roughened surface indicates that it was once there. \n\nNiello was used on a variety of objects including sword hilts, chalices, plates, horns, adornment for horses, jewellery such as bracelets, rings, pendants, and small fittings such as strap-ends, purse-bars, buttons, belt buckles and the like. It was also used to fill in the letters in inscriptions engraved on metal. Periods when engraving filled in with niello has been used to make full images with figures have been relatively few, but include some significant achievements. In ornament, it came to have competition from enamel, with far wider colour possibilities, which eventually displaced it in most of Europe. \n\nThe name derives from the Latin \"nigellum\" for the substance, or \"nigello\" or \"neelo\", the medieval Latin for black. Though historically most common in Europe, it is also known from many parts of Asia and the Near East.\n\nThere are a number of claimed uses of niello from the Mediterranean Bronze Age, all of which have been the subjects of disputes as to the actual composition of the materials used, that have not been conclusively settled, despite some decades of debate. The earliest claimed use of niello appears in late Bronze Age Byblos in Syria, around 1800 BC, in inscriptions in hieroglyphs on \"scimitars\". In Ancient Egypt it appears a little later, in the tomb of Queen Ahhotep II, who lived about 1550 BC, on a dagger decorated with a lion chasing a calf in a rocky landscape in a style that shows Greek influence, or at least similarity to the roughly contemporary daggers from Mycenae, and perhaps other objects in the tomb. \n\nAt about the same time of c.1550 BC it appears on several bronze daggers from shaft grave royal tombs at Mycenae (in Grave Circle A and Grave Circle B), especially in long thin scenes running along the centre of the blade. These show the violence typical of the art of Mycenaean Greece, as well as a sophistication in both technique and figurative imagery that is startlingly original in a Greek context. There are a number of scenes of lions hunting and being hunted, attacking men and being attacked; most are now in the National Archaeological Museum, Athens.\n\nThese are in a mixed-media technique often called \"metalmalerei\" (German: \"painting in metal\"), which involves using gold and silver inlays or applied foils with black niello and the bronze, which would originally have been brightly polished. As well as providing a black colour, the niello was also used as the adhesive to hold the thin gold and silver foils in place. \n\nByblos in Syria, where niello first appears, was something of an Egyptian outpost on the Levant, and many scholars think that it was highly-skilled metalworkers from Syria who introduced the technique to both Egypt and Mycenaean Greece. The iconography can most easily be explained by some combination of influence from the broader traditions of Mesopotamian art where somewhat comparable imagery had been produced for over a thousand years in cylinder seals and the like, and some (such as the physique of the figures) from Minoan art, although no early niello has been found on Crete. \n\nA decorated metal cup, the \"Enkomi Cup\" from Cyprus has also been claimed to use niello decoration. However, controversy has continued since the 1960s as to whether the material used on all these pieces actually is niello, and a succession of increasingly sophisticated scientific tests have failed to provide evidence of the presence of the sulpherous compounds which define niello. It has been suggested that these artefacts, or at least the daggers, use in fact a technique of patinated metal that may be the same as the Corinthian bronze known from ancient literature, and is similar to the Japanese Shakudō.\n\nNiello is then hardly found until the Roman period; or perhaps it first appears around this point. Pliny the Elder (AD 23–79) describes the technique as Egyptian, and remarks the oddness of decorating silver in this way. Some of the earliest uses, from 1-300 AD, seem to be small statuettes and brooches of big cats, where niello is used for the stripes of tigers and the spots on panthers; these were very common in Roman art, as creatures of Bacchus. The animal repertoire of Roman Britain was somewhat different, and provides brooches with niello stripes on a hare and a cat. From about the 4th century, it was used for ornamental details such as borders and for inscriptions in late Roman silver, such as a dish and bowl in the Mildenhall Treasure and pieces in the Hoxne Hoard, including Christian church plate. It was often used on spoons, which were often inscribed with the owner's name, or later crosses. This type of use continued in Byzantine metalwork, from where it passed to Russia. \n\nIt is very common in Anglo-Saxon metalwork, with examples including the Tassilo Chalice, Strickland Brooch, and the Fuller Brooch, generally forming the background for motifs carried in the metal, but also used for rather crude geometric decoration of spots, triangles and stripes on small relatively everyday fittings such as strap-ends in base metal. There is similar use in Celtic, Viking, and other types of Early Medieval jewellery and metalwork, especially in northern Europe. Similar uses continued in the traditional styles of jewellery of the Middle East until at least the 20th century. The Late Roman buckle from Gaul illustrated here shows a relatively high quality early example of this sort of decoration.\n\nIn Romanesque art colourful champlevé enamel largely replaced it, although it continued to be used for small highlights of ornament, and some high quality Mosan art began to use it for small figurative images as part of large pieces, very often applied as plaques. These began to exploit the possibilities of niello for carrying a precise graphic style. The back of the Ottonian Imperial Cross (1020s) has outline engravings of figures filled with niello, the black lines forming the figures on a gold background. Later Romanesque pieces began to use a more densely engraved style, where the figures are mostly carried by the polished metal, against a black background. Romanesque champlevé enamel was applied to a cheap copper or copper alloy form, which was a great advantage, but for some pieces the prestige of precious metal was desired, and a small number of nielloed silver pieces from c. 1175-1200 adopt the ornamental vocabulary developed in Limoges enamel. \n\nA group of high-quality pieces apparently originating in the Rhineland, which use both niello and enamel, include what may be the earliest reliquary with scenes of the murder and burial of Thomas Becket, probably from a few years after his death in 1170 (The Cloisters). Eight large nielloed plaques decorate the sides and roof, six with figures seen close-up at less than half-length, in a very different style from the cruder full-length figures in the many Limoges enamel equivalent reliquaries. \n\nGothic art from the 13th century continued to develop this pictorial use of niello, which reached its high point in the Renaissance. Niello continued to be widely used for simple ornament on small pieces, though at the top end goldsmiths were more likely to use black enamel to fill inscriptions on rings and the like. Niello was also used on plate armour, in this case over etched steel, as well as weapons.\n\nSome Renaissance goldsmiths in Europe, such as Maso Finiguerra and Antonio Pollaiuolo in Florence, decorated their works, usually in silver, by engraving the metal with a burin, after which they filled up the hollows produced by the burin with a black enamel-like compound made of silver, lead and sulphur. The resulting design, called a niello, was of much higher contrast and thus much more visible. Sometimes niello decoration was incidental to the objects, but some pieces such as paxes were effectively pictures in niello. A range of religious objects such as crucifixes and reliquaries might be decorated in this way, as well as secular objects such as knife handles, rings and other jewellery, and fittings such as buckles. It appears that niello-work was probably a specialist activity of some goldsmiths, not practiced by others, and most work came from Florence or Bologna.\n\nNiellists were important in the history of art because they had developed skills and techniques that transferred easily to engraving plates for printmaking on paper, and nearly all the earliest engravers were trained as goldsmiths, enabling the new art medium to develop very quickly. At least in Italy, some of the very earliest engraved prints were in fact made by treating a silver object intended for niello as a printing plate with ink, before the niello was added. These are known as \"niello prints\", or in the cautious words of modern curators, \"printed from a plate engraved in the niello manner\"; in later centuries, after a collector's market grew up, many were forgeries. The genuine Renaissance prints were probably made mainly as a record of his work by the goldsmith, and perhaps as independent art objects.\n\nBy the late 16th century relatively little use was made of niello, especially to create pictures, and a different type of mastic that could be used in much the same way for contrasts in decoration was devised, so European pictorial use was largely restricted to Russia, except for some watches, guns, instruments and the like. Niello has continued to be used sometimes by Western jewellers.\n\nDuring the 10th to 13th century AD, Kievan Rus craftsmen possessed a high degree of skill in jewellery making. John Tsetses, a 12th-century Byzantine writer, praised the work of Kievan Rus artisans and likened their work to the creations of Daedalus, the highly skilled craftsman of Greek mythology.\n\nThe Kievan Rus technique for niello application was first shaping silver or gold by repoussé work, embossing, and casting. They would raise objects in high relief and fill the background with niello using a mixture of red copper, lead, silver, potash, borax, sulphur which was liquefied and poured into concave surfaces before being fired in a furnace. The heat of the furnace would blacken the niello and make the other ornamentation stand out more vividly.\n\nNielloed items were mass-produced using moulds that still survive today and were traded with Greeks, the Byzantine Empire, and other peoples that traded along the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks.\n\nDuring the Mongol invasion from 1237 to 1240 AD, nearly all of Kievan Rus was overrun. Settlements and workshops were burned and razed and most of the craftsmen and artisans were killed. Afterwards, skill in niello and cloisonné enamel diminished greatly. The Ukrainian Museum of Historic Treasures, located in Kiev, has a large collection of nielloed items mostly recovered from tombs found throughout Ukraine.\n\nLater, Veliky Ustyug in North Russia, Tula and Moscow produced high quality pictorial niello pieces such as snuff boxes in contemporary styles such as Rococo and Neoclassicism in the late 18th and early 19th centuries; by then Russia was virtually the only part of Europe regularly using niello in fashionable styles.\n\n \nNiello was rarely used in Sasanian metalwork, which could use it inventively. The Metropolitan Museum of Art has Sasanian shallow bowls or dishes where in one case it forms the stripes on a tiger, and in another the horns and hoofs of goats in relief, as well as parts of the king's weapons. This relief use of niello seems to be paralleled from this period in only one piece of Byzantine silver.\n\nIn the early Islamic world silver, though continuing in use for vessels at the courts of princes, was much less widely used by the merely wealthy. Instead, vessels of the copper alloys bronze and brass included inlays of silver and gold in their often elaborate decoration, leaving less of a place for niello. Other black fillings were also used, and museum descriptions are often vague about the actual substances involved. \n\nThe famous \"Baptistère de Saint Louis,\" c. 1300, a Mamluk basin of engraved brass with gold, silver and niello inlay, which has been in France since at least 1440 (Louis XIII of France and perhaps other kings were baptized in it; now Louvre), is one example where niello is used. Here niello is the background to the figures and the arabesque ornament around them, and used to fill the lines in both.\n\nIt is used on the locking bars of some ivory boxes and caskets, and perhaps continued more widely in use on weapons, where it is certainly found in later centuries from which more material survives. It is common in the decoration of the scabbards and hilts of the large daggers called khanjali and qama traditionally carried by all males in the Caucasus region (whether Muslim or Christian). It was also used to decorate handguns when they came into use. Until modern times relatively simple niello was common on the jewellery of the Levant, used in much the same way as in medieval Europe.\n\nNielloware jewellery and related items from Thailand were popular gifts from American soldiers taking \"R&R\" in Thailand to their girlfriends/wives back home from the 1930s to the 1970s. Most of it was completely handmade jewellery.\n\nThe technique is as follows: the artisan would carve a design into the silver, leaving the figure raised by carving out the \"background\". He would then use the niello inlay to fill in the \"background\". After being baked in an open fire, the alloy would harden. It would then be sanded smooth and buffed. Finally, a silver artisan would add minute details by hand. Filigree was often used for additional ornamentation. Nielloware is classified as only being black and silver coloured. Other coloured jewellery originating during this time uses a different technique and is not considered niello.\n\nMany of the characters shown in nielloware are characters originally found in the Hindu legend \"Ramayana\". The Thai version is called Ramakien. Important Thai cultural symbols were also frequently used.\n\nVarious slightly different recipes are found by modern scientific analysis, and historic accounts. In early periods, niello seems to have been made with a single sulphide, that of the main metal of the piece, even if it was gold (which would be difficult to handle). Copper sulphide niello has only been found on Roman pieces, and silver sulphide is used on silver. Later a mixture of metals was used; Pliny gives a mixed sulphide recipe with silver and copper, but seems to have been some centuries ahead of his time, as such mixtures have not been identified by analysis on pre-medieval pieces. Most Byzantine and early medieval pieces analysed are silver-copper, while silver-copper-lead pieces appear from about the 11th century onwards. \n\nThe \"Mappae clavicula\" of about the 9th century, Theophilus Presbyter (1070–1125) and Benvenuto Cellini (1500–1571) give detailed accounts, using silver-copper-lead mixtures with slightly different ratios of ingredients, Cellini using more lead. Typical ingredients have been described as: : \"sulfur with several metallic ingredients and borax\"; \"copper, silver, and lead, to which had been added sulphur while the metal was in fluid form ... [the design] was then brushed over with a solution of borax...\". \n\nWhile some recipes talk of using furnaces and muffles to melt the niello, others just seem to use an open fire. The necessary temperatures vary with the mixture; overall silver-copper-lead mixtures are easier to use. All mixtures have the same black appearance after work is completed.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was ported internally by Sega of America for the Master System and Game Gear consoles, the latter being published by Acclaim Entertainment through its Flying Edge division. An updated version was also released for the Sega CD under the name of \"The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin\".\n\nAll versions of the video game are side-scrolling platform games, whereby the player controls superhero Spider-Man to battle various supervillains (Doctor Octopus, Sandman, The Lizard, Hobgoblin, Vulture, Mysterio, Electro, and Venom) to obtain the keys needed to disarm a nuclear bomb that the Kingpin has not only framed Spider-Man for stealing but plans to detonate within twenty-four hours. In the middle of the game, Spider-Man's wife Mary Jane Watson is also kidnapped by Venom.\n\nThe Sega Mega Drive version was released in 1991 and was widely popular with comic book fans, helping to establish the success of the 16-bit Mega Drive/Genesis system. Critics noted that the game had superior graphics, sound and faithfully recreated the characters for the video game universe, even allowing the player to take pictures of the major and minor enemies in the video game to sell at the \"Daily Bugle\" to buy more web fluid. The additional ultra-hard challenge was a fight with Venom at the end of each round, before reaching the actual boss. In addition to Venom, there are also many other popular \"Spider-Man\" villains that player would have to fight, such as Doctor Octopus, Lizard, Electro, Mysterio, Sandman and Hobgoblin.\n\nAccording to developer Randel B. Reiss, this version was a huge commercial success: two thirds of all Mega Drive owners at the time also bought the game, and single-handedly convinced Marvel Comics not to cancel the licensing deal they had with Sega.\n\nThe 8-bit Sega Master System version is noted as one of the last Master System games officially sold in North America. Like other Master System games released in the United States in 1991, it is European imports that were published by Sega of America, as no boxes or manuals were produced for the American market. The game had the same basic format and storyline as the 16-bit version, with redesigned levels, cutscenes (that included a cameo from Doctor Strange) and even on the easiest setting was seen as being difficult to complete. In this version Mary Jane wouldn't be kidnapped but still appear at the end of the game if players attain the best ending.\n\nA nearly identical port was also released for the Sega Game Gear portable system.\n\nThe 16-bit Mega-CD/Sega CD version (1993) made several improvements to game to take advantage of extra memory capabilities of the CD-ROM system. Animated scenes, with voice actors, were added to move the story along and to show what happened when the player died. Gameplay was sped up in this version; Spider-Man could move and climb surfaces significantly faster than in the Mega Drive version. The game also added two new levels, extra combat moves, the ability to collect reproductions of famous Spider-Man comic books issues, and an original musical score by Spencer Nilsen and the Mr. Big rock band. The game also was more non-linear as the player could venture to various locations throughout the city (including a local television station). However, the ability to take pictures during the game in order to earn money for web fluid was taken out of this version. The game also added two new levels (Mysterio's Funhouse and the Vulture in the subway). In addition, before battling the Kingpin, the player must first defeat Bullseye and Typhoid Mary. The game had three different difficulty levels (easy, normal and nightmare) and a contest was held (details were provided in the instructions manual along with a sheet to mail in) to see who could successfully complete the game in the ultra-hard \"nightmare\" mode and collect all 21 comic book covers.\n\nIn the final level of the Mega-CD and Mega Drive games, Spider-Man must defeat Kingpin before Mary Jane is dropped into a pit of acid. The Mega-CD version features some alternate cutscenes depending on the outcome of this level. If the player beats Kingpin, but not in time to save Mary Jane from falling into the acid pit, the police will arrest Kingpin and Spider-Man angrily vows to avenge Mary Jane. If the player fails to defeat Kingpin (or his bodyguards), Spider-Man and Mary Jane will be tied up and lowered into the acid pit together. The Mega Drive version is similar, only Kingpin will escape once Mary Jane is killed, leaving a heartbroken Spider-Man on his knees.\n\nIn the Master System version, Mary Jane doesn't get kidnapped. If the player loses or flees the final battle, though, Kingpin will get away.\n\n"}

His most recent feature, \"The King\", nominated for a 2019 Grammy Award for Best Music Film of the Year, had its North American premiere at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival, following its international premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in 2017.\n\nHe is the author of \"The American Way of War: Guided Missiles, Misguided Men, and a Republic in Peril\" (Simon & Schuster).\n\nJarecki was born in New Haven, CT, grew up in New York, and attended Princeton University. He is the son of Henry Jarecki and Gloria Jarecki, a former film critic at Time Magazine. Jarecki is the brother of fellow filmmaker Andrew Jarecki (Capturing the Friedmans, The Jinx) and finance executive Thomas A. Jarecki. His half-brother Nicholas Jarecki (Arbitrage) is also a filmmaker.\n\nJarecki trained as a stage director at Princeton but pivoted to film after graduating. His first short film \"Season of the Lifterbees\" premiered at the 1993 Sundance Film Festival before winning both a Student Academy Award and the Time Warner Grand Prize at the Aspen Film Festival.\n\nJarecki then directed two feature films released in 2000. One was the documentary \"Quest of the Carib Canoe\", which documents an effort by indigenous Carib Indians of the Island of Dominica to build an ancient ocean-going canoe and retrace their ancestors' path from South America's Orinoco Delta in what is now modern Guyana to the islands of the Caribbean. His second film that year was a dramatic feature called \"The Opponent\" released by Lionsgate. In 2002, his first theatrical documentary feature \"The Trials of Henry Kissinger\" was released to critical acclaim. Winner of the 2002 Amnesty International Award, the film was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award and has been broadcast in over thirty countries. In 2002, \"Trials\" was selected to launch both the Sundance Channel's DOCday venture as well as the BBC's digital channel, BBC Four.\n\nBy 2005, Jarecki had distinguished himself as a filmmaker unafraid of serious, penetrating investigations, when his film \"Why We Fight\" about the role of America's military-industrial complex in leading the nation into the tragic quagmire of the Iraq War, won the Sundance Grand Jury Prize and a Peabody Award. He also received a nomination for Best Documentary Screenplay from the Writers Guild of America for the film.\n\nAlongside directors Alex Gibney, Morgan Spurlock, and Rachel Grady, Jarecki then directed a segment of the 2010 feature \"Freakonomics\" based on the 2005 book \"Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything\" by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner. The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival that year.\n\nIn 2011, Jarecki returned to the Sundance Film Festival with his Emmy Award-winning film \"Reagan\", before its national television release on HBO on what would have been 40th President's 100th birthday. The next year, \"The House I Live In\", his film about America's War on Drugs, won Jarecki a second Grand Jury Prize at Sundance as well as a second Peabody Award. The film, produced by Danny Glover, John Legend, Brad Pitt, and Russell Simmons, was released theatrically in several countries and was exhibited in over 130 U.S. prisons, churches, and statehouses, as well as on Capitol Hill. Along with the music video of the same name, featuring John Legend, and the viral short \"\"JUST SAY NO...to the War on Drugs\"\", (both directed by Jarecki), the film is credited with changing the national conversation on U.S. drug policy.\n\nIn 2014, Jarecki took part in the first Ted Talk in the history of Cuba at Havana's Teatro Nacional. Events that occurred in the days leading up to the talk became the subject of Jarecki's 2016 short film, \"The Cyclist (El Ciclista)\" which he directed for The New Yorker/Amazon.\n\nIn 2015, Jarecki served as Executive Producer on the documentary feature film \"(T)ERROR\", directed by Lyric Cabral and David Felix Sutcliff, which won Jarecki a Sundance Special Jury Prize and his second Emmy Award. That same year, he also executive produced Laura Israel's feature documentary \"Don't Blink – Robert Frank\" about the late legendary photographer's work and career.\n\nHis most recent film, \"The King\", produced by Steven Soderbergh, Errol Morris, and Rosanne Cash, premiered at Cannes and Sundance before its 2018 theatrical release by Universal Pictures and Oscilloscope Laboratories and its television premiere on PBS Independent Lens. Nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Music Film, The King is a musical road trip in Elvis Presley’s 1963 Rolls Royce that features Alec Baldwin, Chuck D, Emmylou Harris, Mike Myers, Rosanne Cash, Van Jones, and Ethan Hawke, among others, tracing the rise and fall of Elvis as a metaphor for the country he left behind. Alongside the film, Jarecki created a series of music videos for artists such as Lana Del Rey, M. Ward, The Handsome Family, Immortal Technique, the Stax Music Academy All-Stars and more.\n\nIn 2018, Jarecki’s first public contemporary art exhibit, entitled Promised Land, co-created by Laura Israel, Alex Bingham, and UK-based artist Georgina Hill, and produced by Andrew McLain, was featured at Miami Art Basel as part of \"\"This is Not America\"\" at the Faena Hotel, Miami Beach. A multiscreen video presentation, Promised Land was inspired by Jarecki’s 2018 film, \"The King\".\n\nIn 2019, it was announced that Jarecki is returning to dramatic filmmaking with a yet-untitled action film about a Saharan, Tuareg nomad, who seeks revenge for a crime committed against his tribal customs. Jarecki wrote the screenplay with his son Jonas Jarecki, based on a best-selling novel. Addison O'Dea is producing.\n\nAs a public intellectual on U.S. domestic and international policy, Jarecki has appeared on a variety of national television programs including \"The Daily Show\", \"The Colbert Report\", \"Real Time with Bill Maher\", \"Fox & Friends\", and \"Charlie Rose\". In 2010, he created the short film \"Move Your Money\", encouraging Americans to move their banking from \"too big to fail\" banks into smaller community banks and credit unions. It became a viral sensation leading to an estimated 4 million Americans moving their money out of major banks. \n\nJarecki is also the Founder and Executive director of The Eisenhower Project, an academic public policy group, dedicated, in the spirit of Dwight D. Eisenhower, to studying the forces that shape American foreign policy. He has been a visiting fellow at Brown University's Watson Institute for International Studies and is the author of \"The American Way of War\" (2008), published by Simon & Schuster/Free Press.\n\nJarecki has also participated as a speaker at several international conferences including Ted, Nantucket Project, and will.i.am's \"TRANS4M\" gathering for the i.am.angel Foundation.\n\nAt the 2014 Nantucket Project, Jarecki conducted a public interview with WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Julian Assange as a hologram, beamed in to Nantucket from his place of asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.\n\nJarecki wrote in \"The Guardian\" before the event, \"it crosses my mind I may be abetting a crime or violating international extradition laws. But I reassure myself that, in this regard, the worldwide web remains a kind of wild wild west, and the virtual escape of a person is not (yet?) a crime.\"\n\nAs a sequel to this interview, Jarecki publicly interviewed former U.S. Army soldier Chelsea Manning at the 2017 Nantucket Project, after her 35-year prison sentence was commuted by President Obama. In the Guardian, Jarecki wrote, \"Manning sees connections in the duty of the soldier who uncovers high crimes, to the death of secrecy in the digital age, to the role of the individual in a society where privacy is as besieged as sexual orientation.\"\nIn April 2020 Jarecki created the Trump Death Clock, a 56-foot billboard in Times Square New York City that shows a daily estimate of the total portion of U.S COVID-19 deaths resulting from President Trump and his administration's delayed response to the pandemic. The website www.TrumpDeathClock.com provides an up-to-the minute estimate. Visitors can learn more about the human cost of the administration's inaction between March 9 and 16, 2020, which epidemiologists have identified as a crucial period in the virus' exponential spread. The site reached over 200,000 visits in just its first few days of operation, and Jarecki published a Washington Post editorial explaining the math epidemiology behind the Clock's design.\n\n\n\n\nFrom BBC \"Storyville\" interview about \"Why We Fight\":\n\nFrom \"Huffington Post\" on Obama and Afghanistan:\n\n"}

The Morellos were based in Manhattan's Italian Harlem and eventually gained dominance in the Italian underworld by defeating the rival Neapolitan Camorra of Brooklyn.\n\nThe Morello family traces back to Corleone, Sicily. In 1865, Calogero Morello married Angelina Piazza who gave birth to two children: Giuseppe Morello (born May 2, 1867) and Maria Morello-Lima (née Morello, born c. 1869). Calogero Morello died in 1872, and one year later Piazza remarried to Bernardo Terranova. The new marriage produced five children: three sons, Vincenzo (born 1886), Ciro (born 1888), and Nicolo (born 1890), and two daughters, Lucia (born 1877) and Salvatrice (born 1880). Critchley mentions a possible third sister of the Terranovas, Rosalia Lomonte (born 1892 - died October 14, 1915).\n\nIn 1892, Giuseppe Morello emigrated to the United States. On March 8, 1893, Giuseppe's family arrived in New York: his wife Maria Rosa Marvalisi, his mother Angelina Piazza, his stepfather Bernardo Terranova, his half-brothers Ciro, Nicolo, and Vincenzo, and his half-sister Rosalia. The Morello-Terranova family lived in New York for a while before moving to Louisiana, then Texas, and by 1896 the family was back in New York City.\n\nThe brothers returned to New York and became known as the \"107th Street Mob\" (sometimes called the \"Morello Gang\") dominating East Harlem, Manhattan, and parts of the Bronx. Giuseppe Morello's strongest ally was Ignazio Lupo, a mobster who controlled Little Italy, Manhattan. On December 23, 1903, Lupo married Morello's half sister, Salvatrice Terranova.\n\nThe Morello-Lupo alliance continued to prosper in 1903, when the group began a major counterfeiting ring with powerful Sicilian \"mafioso\" \"Don\" Vito Cascio Ferro, printing $5 bills in Sicily and smuggling them into the United States. Many of the later \"barrel murders\", particularly that of Giuseppe \"Joe\" Catania, Sr. (whose body was found in July 1902), were thought to have been committed by the Morellos, who employed a numerous members of the counterfeiting operation.\n\nOn April 13, 1903, the body of Benedetto Madonia, brother-in-law to police informant Giuseppe DiPrimo (de Priemo), was found in a barrel after being brutally tortured. A United States Secret Service detective, who had been investigating the counterfeiting ring, traced the man to a restaurant where he was seen with Morello crime family boss, Ignazio Lupo, along with associate and hitman, Tommaso \"The Ox\" Petto. New York detective Joseph Petrosino later confirmed Madonia's identity after visiting DiPrimo at Sing Sing Prison. A letter by Madonia seeking to leave the organization was found in a search of Madonia's house. With this evidence, several \"mafiosi\" were arrested including Morello, Lupo, Petto, and restaurant owner Pietro Inzarillo, as well as several other members. However, the charges were later dropped after witnesses changed their statements.\n\nThe Morello family had consolidated their hold on Upper Manhattan. Additionally, on November 15, 1909, New York police raided a building the Morellos were using in Highland, New York, as a front for their counterfeiting operation and recovered a large amount of American and Canadian counterfeit bills. After letters were found by Black Hand victims from New Orleans, fifteen members of the Morellos were arrested, including bosses Giuseppe Morello and Ignazio Lupo and member Pasquale Vassi, who possessed $1,200 worth of counterfeit money.\n\nThe trials began on January 26, 1910, and ended on February 19 with all members involved convicted, including Morello and Lupo, who were sentenced to 30 and 25 years, respectively, at Atlanta Federal Prison.\n\nWith Giuseppe Morello's and Lupo's conviction, Nicholas \"Nick\" Terranova, the youngest of the three Terranova brothers, took over the family with the aid of his older brothers, Vincenzo and Ciro. The family was involved in many criminal activities from East Harlem to Greenwich Village. Soon after opening the Venezia Restaurant, the club became a popular hangout for the city's underworld.\n\nWithout Joseph Morello and Lupo the Wolf at the helm, the Morellos' power was waning. During this time, Gaetano Reina, a captain within the family, took advantage of its weakened status and broke off, forming his own separate mafia \"famiglia\" based mostly in the Bronx. Nick Terranova made an effort to unify much of the Italian underworld in the face of these problems. His efforts to unify the Sicilian \"mafiosi\" and the Neapolitan \"camorristi\" during the early 1910s were unsuccessful despite his best efforts.\n\nDuring this time, the Morellos had allied with powerful and prominent East Harlem businessmen and \"camorristi\", including Giosue Gallucci, who possessed local political connections, and the Lamonti brothers. Gaetano \"Thomas\" Lamonti and brother Fortunato \"Charles\" Lamonti were known as friends of the Morellos and owned a feed store down the street from the famous Murder Stable owned by Ignazio Lupo. After the 1914 murder of Charles Lamonti and the 1915 murder of Gallucci, the alliance between the Morellos and the East Harlem \"camorristi\" ended. The Brooklyn \"camorristi\" made plans to eliminate the \"mafiosi\" from Manhattan.\n\nIn early 1916, Camorra boss Pellegrino Morano and lieutenant Vincenzo Paragallo began moving into Morello territory. After six months of fighting, Morano offered a truce to end the stalemate. Mafia boss Nick Morello agreed to a meeting arranged at a Navy Street café owned by \"camorrista\" Alessandro Vollero. However, upon arriving on September 7, 1916, Morello was ambushed by five members of the Brooklyn Camorra group and killed along with bodyguard Charles Ubriaco. While the loss of the Morello family's senior leader was a blow to the Mafia, Camorra boss Pellegrino Morano was quickly charged with Nick Morello's murder after two members of the Camorra group, Tony Notoro and Ralph Daniello, contacted New York police and implicated Morano and Alessandro Vollero, revealing the war between the Sicilian and Neapolitan gangs. Both Morano and Vollero, after being denied help from New York detective Michael Mealli, along with the remaining leaders of the \"camorristi\" were convicted of murder and imprisoned, effectively ending the Mafia-Camorra War.\n\nThe Mafia–Camorra war ended in 1917, and Terranova brothers Vincenzo and Ciro kept control of the family. Many former Brooklyn Camorra members joined the Morello family; Umberto Valenti was one of new members. One year earlier in 1916, Giuseppe Masseria was released from prison after serving three years for burglary of a Bowery pawnshop and became a top member in the family. In 1918, Ciro Terranova was tried for the murders of gambling bosses Charles Lombardi and Joe DiMarco; the case was later dismissed. In 1920, both Giuseppe Morello and Ignazio Lupo were released from prison so their former captain, now Manhattan Mafia boss, Salvatore D'Aquila, sensing his power to be threatened by their return, ordered their murders.\n\nOne of D'Aquila's men, Umberto Valenti, had also run afoul of his boss and was under threat of death. To re-ingratiate himself with D'Aquila, Valenti would take out the rising power, the former captain and current ally of the Morello's, Giuseppe Masseria. First attempts failed and a war was on. On December 29, 1921, Masseria's men murdered Valenti's ally Salvatore Muaro on Chrystie Street. Then Valenti had Vincent Terranova murdered, effectively taking out the head of the Morello family. On May 8, 1922, while Terranova was in front of his home at 116th Street and 2nd Avenue, he was shot by a gunman from a moving car. Masseria ordered his men to murder Valenti and his bodyguard Silva Tagliagamba; they ambushed Valenti and Tagliabamba at Grande and Mulberry Streets in Manhattan shooting Tagliabamba but Valenti escaped. On August 11, 1922, Masseria's men (supposedly including a young Charlie Luciano) murdered Valenti ending the conflict. Masseria became the boss of the Morello family, and Giuseppe Morello became his underboss.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2039642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2039642", "title": "Double Switch (video game)", "text": "Double Switch (video game)\n\nDouble Switch is an adventure interactive movie video game originally released for Sega CD, Sega Saturn and Microsoft Windows and later remastered for mobile, Steam, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. The game was produced by Digital Pictures and had a similar \"trap-em-up\" format to \"Space Panic\", \"Heiankyo Alien\", and their earlier game, \"Night Trap\". Apart from the HUD, the graphics consist of live action full motion video clips starring Corey Haim.\n\n\nThe game takes place in an apartment complex called the Edward Arms, which was built by the famous industrialist Lionel Atwater Edward III at the turn of the 20th Century. Built following an archaeological expedition to the Valley of the Kings, the building has an ancient Egypt theme and is rumored to hide a valuable statue of Isix (named after the precursor to Digital Pictures) stolen by Edward during his expedition. The player character, an anonymous, silent protagonist, is contacted via video call by the current owner of the Edward Arms, a young man named Eddie. Eddie says that he has equipped the building with cameras and traps to protect the tenants from the local criminal element, but one of the tenants has locked him in the basement. He gives the player character control of the cameras and traps and directs him to protect the tenants, trap the handyman Lyle whenever possible, and find the security codes to get him out.\n\nAfter the player character acquires all the security codes, Eddie confides in him that one of the tenants is a killer. When he emerges from his basement prison, Eddie runs into Lyle and Elizabeth, the building's manager. Eddie and Lyle's argument reveals that Eddie is mentally unhinged, that Lyle and Elizabeth are his parents, and that Lyle locked him in the basement to keep him from doing harm to himself or others.\n\nEach tenant has their own plot line that overlaps into the main plot. Alex, a journalist fresh out of college, enthusiastically investigates the many dangerous goings-on. Laura, an aspiring architect, and Phoebe, an archaeology student, share a room and have acquired a unique Egyptian statue. Another room is occupied by Scream, a hard rock band in search of a record deal. Brutus is an aging mobster whose father worked on the construction of the Edward Arms. His father told him of gold concealed in the building, and Brutus wants to find it so he can pay off a debt to a dangerous mob boss. Elizabeth is trying to rekindle her relationship with Lyle. Though Lyle is held back by fears that any children they have will turn out like Eddie, he ultimately yields to her seductions.\n\nMembers of a secret society infiltrate the Edward Arms and go after Phoebe and Jeff as soon as they spot them with the statue. They escape and Jeff hides the statue in his room just before an A&R man arrives to audition Scream. One of the secret society attacks Jeff during the audition, but the player character uses a trap to save him and the A&R man decides to give Scream the label's fullest support. Meanwhile, Lyle goes around the building showing the player character dangerous traps that Eddie either did not know about or chose not to share with him. Lyle rewires these traps to give the player character control so that he can stop Eddie.\n\nThe building's killer appears dressed as a mummy. He herds the tenants into reach of the traps and tries to spring the traps using a remote control. The player character saves the tenants, and as the mummy is locked into a chair trap, Alex and Phoebe take the remote control away and unmask the mummy as Eddie. Enraged, Eddie vows to kill everyone in the building.\n\nAlex and Phoebe petition Elizabeth for help, but Elizabeth is in denial of Eddie's problems. Angered by the girls' accusations, she locks the Edward Arms's entrance, trapping the tenants inside. Aided by the player character's trapping Eddie, the girls reunite with Laura and Jeff. Jeff suggests that Brutus likely has a gun that they can use to protect themselves. They find Brutus in his room, where Eddie attacks them, but is again trapped by the player character and returned to his basement prison. Elizabeth takes the statue from the girls and explains that Eddie had figured out that the statue is actually a key which transforms the entire Edward Arms into a giant treasury. The tenants stare in unified awe at the riches on display. Afterwards, someone takes the statue out of the lock to the treasury, resealing it.\n\nThe objective of the game is to protect the tenants of the Edward Arms. The player character never actually enters the building, and must protect the tenants using the surveillance cameras, sensors, and traps installed in eight of the rooms. Using the cameras, the player may view any of the rooms, but can only view one room at a time, as with \"Night Trap\". However, unlike \"Night Trap\", at all times a mini map shows the player whether tenants, intruders, or both are present in each room, and an alarm sounds when an intruder enters any room. In addition, many of the intruders' appearances occur at random. Success in the game thus depends on quickly and effectively responding to situations rather than on determining when and where enemies appear.\n\nWhen a tenant or intruder approaches a trap, the player may trap them by arming and then activating the trap. Trapping a tenant sometimes has no real consequences, but often results in a game over. If the player does not trap a solid majority of intruders as they appear, the game ends. Also, while most intruders do no particular harm when they appear, the player must trap any enemies who try to shut off the building's power, disconnect the phone lines, or attack the tenants. If an enemy succeeds in any one of those three things, the game immediately ends.\n\nIn addition to these objectives, each of the game's three levels (referred to in the manual as \"acts\") has its own special objective. In the first level the player must view the security codes needed to free Eddie from the basement. In level two the player must gain access to new hidden alcove traps. Level 3 includes a boss who the player must trap six times. If the player misses any opportunity to trap the boss, the boss will attack one or more of the tenants, resulting in a game over.\n\nThe Windows, Sega Saturn, and Mac editions were released later with enhanced video quality and Eddie's references to the Sega Genesis controller removed, though a TV in the game shows a screenshot from the Sega CD version no matter what version is being played.\n\n\"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave the Sega CD version a 6 out of 10, describing it as \"like \"Night Trap\", [but] a little more involving\". Manny LaMancha of \"GamePro\" praised the full-motion video quality and Thomas Dolby's music for the game, and said that \"Double Switch is good enough that it'll sit in your CD tray until you're done – and you'll be glad you stuck it through the end.\"\n\nReviewing the Saturn version, a \"Next Generation\" critic felt that \"Double Switch\" holds up fairly well as a movie, with high production values, decent acting, and \"top-notch\" sets, but not as a game. He particularly noted the awkward interface and the repetitiveness of having to rewatch the same video segments over and over while using trial and error to figure out the correct course of actions. He also said that the poor video quality would have been acceptable on the Sega CD, but not on the Saturn. While \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" never published an official review of the Saturn version, their preview based on a 90% complete beta was written in the manner of a review. They agreed that the graphics, while an improvement over the Sega CD version, are not up to Saturn standards, and also criticized the \"highly confusing\" gameplay. They concluded, \"Players who are expecting a revamped version of \"Night Trap\" are sadly mistaken. This title boasts nothing more than a fallen star thrown in with other B-actors that have as much of a future as this title.\"\n\nAfter Digital Pictures' bankruptcy, the games were purchased by a consortium that included visual effects company Flash Film Works. In December 2016, \"Double Switch\" was remastered from the original source video and released as an app for Google Play and iTunes. Additionally, in June 2018 it was announced that William Mesa and Flash Film Works had partnered with Screaming Villains and Limited Run Games to release the game on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch as \"Double Switch: 25th Anniversary Edition\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2039659", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2039659", "title": "Dick Sisler", "text": "Dick Sisler\n\nRichard Alan Sisler (November 2, 1920 – November 20, 1998) was an American professional baseball player, coach, and manager in Major League Baseball (MLB). He was the son of Hall of Fame first baseman and two-time .400 hitter George Sisler. Younger brother Dave Sisler was a relief pitcher in the 1950s and 1960s with four MLB teams, and older brother George Jr. was a longtime executive in Minor League Baseball (MiLB).\n\nSisler attended Colgate University. Listed at tall and , he batted left-handed and threw right-handed.\n\nHe was a journeyman left fielder and first baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals (1946–47; 1952–53), Philadelphia Phillies (1948–51) and Cincinnati Reds (1952). In an eight-season career, he hit .276 with 720 hits, 55 home runs and 360 RBI in 799 games. Defensively, he recorded an overall .984 fielding percentage playing primarily at first base and left field.\n\nOnly with the Phillies did Sisler play on a consistent basis; he was Philadelphia's most-used first baseman in 1948 and 1949, and regular left fielder in 1950 and 1951. He made the National League All-Star team in 1950, a season during which Sisler reached personal bests in games played (141), games started (136, all in left field), at bats (523), runs scored (79), hits (155), doubles (29), homers (13), runs batted in (83), on-base percentage (.373), slugging percentage (.442) and batting average (.296). The season also gave Sisler lasting fame.\n\nOn the 1950 season's closing day, at Ebbets Field, with the game tied at one, Sisler hit a tenth-inning, opposite-field three-run home run against the Brooklyn Dodgers that led to the \"Whiz Kids\" Phillies winning the club's first National League pennant in 35 years. Had Philadelphia lost, the Phillies and Dodgers would have finished in a flatfooted tie for the NL championship and a best-of-three playoff would have resulted. \n\nThe home run made Sisler world-famous in both baseball and literary circles; Ernest Hemingway immortalized him in his novel \"The Old Man and the Sea.\" In a conversation between an aging Cuban fisherman and his young apprentice discussing the unfolding 1950 big-league season, the older man says:\n\n\"In the other league, between Brooklyn and Philadelphia, I must take Brooklyn. But then I think of Dick Sisler and those great drives in the old park. There was nothing ever like them. He hits the longest ball I have ever seen.\"\nHis father, George Sr., was a scout for Brooklyn in 1950. When asked after the pennant-winning game how he felt when his son beat his current team, the Dodgers, George replied, \"I felt awful and terrific at the same time.\"\n\nIn the 1950 World Series that followed, however, Sisler would collect only one single in 17 at bats (.059), as the Phillies were swept by the New York Yankees in four games. Earlier, in 1946, he had gone hitless in two at bats as a pinch hitter for the Cardinals in that season's Fall Classic, but picked up a World Series ring when the Redbirds defeated the Boston Red Sox in seven games. Twenty-one years later, while serving as the Cardinals' first base coach, he earned his second ring when St. Louis again defeated the Red Sox in a seven-game series.\n\nAfter managing in the minor leagues with the Double-A Nashville Vols and Triple-A Seattle Rainiers, Sisler became a coach for Cincinnati in , serving under manager Fred Hutchinson. \n\nIn August , he was promoted to acting manager when Hutchinson, suffering from terminal cancer, was forced to give up the reins. He led the Reds to a 32–21 record, and the team finished in a second-place tie (with the Phillies), one game behind the Cardinals. After his formal appointment as manager in October 1964, he brought the Reds home fourth in with an 89–73 mark before being fired at season's end. He then returned to the major league coaching ranks with the Cardinals (1966–70), San Diego Padres (1975–76) and New York Mets (1979–80). In his late sixties, he was still working with young players as a roving hitting instructor in the Cardinal farm system.\n\nHe died November 20, 1998, at the age of 78 in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n\n\n"}

He is a distinguished professor of musical theatre at Western Carolina University, and is an artistic director of the Carolina Arts Festival and the North Carolina Theatre. His film credits include \"Critters\", \"A Chorus Line\", \"Big Top Pee-wee\" and \"Solarbabies\". He stars as the villain Whispers in the Netflix series \"Sense8\".\n\nMann was born in Ashland, Kentucky, the eldest of 3 sons to Helen and Charles Mann. Mann's mother was a concert pianist, and his father sang in a barbershop quartet. Music was part of his growing up, so singing came naturally to him. But it was the multiple pleasures of the stage that drew him to the world of theater.\n\nIn an interview with the \"Hartford Courant\", Mann said: \"When I was doing the junior class play — it was called 'In Deadly Earnest' — at the end of a scene, the script said, 'They kiss.' It was then that I honestly thought, 'I'm going to be in the theater!' I was fascinated with having words put in my mouth and that someone would say something back to me that would get us to a moment where we ended up in a kiss. I remember when my school counselor asked me what I wanted to do, I said without hesitation, 'Go into the theater!'\"\n\nMann grew up in Largo, Florida and he is a 1969 graduate of Largo High School. His first professional job came during his college years in Jacksonville University. For $35 a week, he was offered the job of performing in the annual outdoor theater spectacular \"The Lost Colony,\" during summers on the Outer banks of Manteo, North Carolina. It was here he met Joe Layton, who later was instrumental in getting him his first Broadway show.\n\nMann later attended the North Carolina School of the Arts, where his mentor was Malcolm Morrison, former dean at The Hartt School at the University of Hartford. For many years Mann was a regular at Morrison's North Carolina Shakespeare Festival.\n\nMann made his Broadway debut in 1980 in \"Barnum\" at the St. James Theatre, in the supporting role of Chester Lyman.

{"id": "2039690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2039690", "title": "Isotopes of hydrogen", "text": "Isotopes of hydrogen\n\nHydrogen (H) has three naturally occurring isotopes, sometimes denoted H, H, and H. The first two of these are stable, while H has a half-life of 12.32 years. There are also heavier isotopes, which are all synthetic and have a half-life less than one zeptosecond (10 second). Of these, H is the most stable, and H is the least.\n\nHydrogen is the only element whose isotopes have different names in common use today: the H (or hydrogen-2) isotope is deuterium and the H (or hydrogen-3) isotope is tritium. The symbols D and T are sometimes used for deuterium and tritium. The IUPAC accepts the D and T symbols, but recommends instead using standard isotopic symbols (H and H) to avoid confusion in the alphabetic sorting of chemical formulas. The ordinary isotope of hydrogen, with no neutrons, is sometimes called protium. (During the early study of radioactivity, some other heavy radioactive isotopes were given names, but such names are rarely used today.)\n\nH (atomic mass ) is the most common hydrogen isotope with an abundance of more than 99.98%. Because the nucleus of this isotope consists of only a single proton, it is given the formal name \"protium\".\n\nThe proton has never been observed to decay, and hydrogen-1 is therefore considered a stable isotope. Some grand unified theories proposed in the 1970s predict that proton decay can occur with a half-life between 10 and 10 years. If this prediction is found to be true, then hydrogen-1 (and indeed all nuclei now believed to be stable) are only observationally stable. To date, experiments have shown that the minimum proton half-life is in excess of 10 years.\n\nH (atomic mass ), the other stable hydrogen isotope, is known as \"deuterium\" and contains one proton and one neutron in its nucleus. The nucleus of deuterium is called a deuteron. Deuterium comprises 0.0026–0.0184% (by population, not by mass) of hydrogen samples on Earth, with the lower number tending to be found in samples of hydrogen gas and the higher enrichment (0.015% or 150 ppm) typical of ocean water. Deuterium on Earth has been enriched with respect to its initial concentration in the Big Bang and the outer solar system (about 27 ppm, by atom fraction) and its concentration in older parts of the Milky Way galaxy (about 23 ppm). Presumably the differential concentration of deuterium in the inner solar system is due to the lower volatility of deuterium gas and compounds, enriching deuterium fractions in comets and planets exposed to significant heat from the Sun over billions of years of solar system evolution.\n\nDeuterium is not radioactive, and does not represent a significant toxicity hazard. Water enriched in molecules that include deuterium instead of protium is called heavy water. Deuterium and its compounds are used as a non-radioactive label in chemical experiments and in solvents for H-NMR spectroscopy. Heavy water is used as a neutron moderator and coolant for nuclear reactors. Deuterium is also a potential fuel for commercial nuclear fusion.\n\nH (atomic mass ) is known as \"tritium\" and contains one proton and two neutrons in its nucleus. It is radioactive, decaying into helium-3 through β− decay with a half-life of 12.32 years. Trace amounts of tritium occur naturally because of the interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric gases. Tritium has also been released during nuclear weapons tests. It is used in thermonuclear fusion weapons, as a tracer in isotope geochemistry, and specialized in self-powered lighting devices.\n\nThe most common method of producing tritium is by bombarding a natural isotope of lithium, lithium-6, with neutrons in a nuclear reactor.\n\nTritium was once used routinely in chemical and biological labeling experiments as a radiolabel, which has become less common in recent times. D-T nuclear fusion uses tritium as its main reactant, along with deuterium, liberating energy through the loss of mass when the two nuclei collide and fuse at high temperatures.\n\nH (atomic mass is ) contains one proton and three neutrons in its nucleus. It is a highly unstable isotope of hydrogen. It has been synthesised in the laboratory by bombarding tritium with fast-moving deuterium nuclei. In this experiment, the tritium nucleus captured a neutron from the fast-moving deuterium nucleus. The presence of the hydrogen-4 was deduced by detecting the emitted protons. It decays through neutron emission into hydrogen-3 (tritium) with a half-life of about 139 ± 10 yoctoseconds (or seconds).\n\nIn the 1955 satirical novel \"The Mouse That Roared\", the name \"quadium\" was given to the hydrogen-4 isotope that powered the \"Q-bomb\" that the Duchy of Grand Fenwick captured from the United States.\n\nHydrogen-4.1 looks like helium, it has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. One of its electrons was changed by a muon. Since the orbital of the muon is special and very near the atomic nucleus, that muon can see as a part of the atomic nucleus. The whole atomic nucleus can look as: \"The atomic nucleus is form by 1 muon, 2 protons and 2 neutrons, and only one electron outside\", so it can look as one of the isotopes of hydrogen, and an exotic atom, too. A muon's weight is 0.1U，so its name was Hydrogen-4.1(H). The Hydrogen-4.1 atom can react with other atoms. Its behavior looks like a hydrogen atom and not a noble helium atom.\n\nH is a highly unstable isotope of hydrogen. The nucleus consists of a proton and four neutrons. It has been synthesised in the laboratory by bombarding tritium with fast-moving tritium nuclei. In this experiment, one tritium nucleus captures two neutrons from the other, becoming a nucleus with one proton and four neutrons. The remaining proton may be detected, and the existence of hydrogen-5 deduced. It decays through double neutron emission into hydrogen-3 (tritium) and has a half-life of at least 910 yoctoseconds (9.1 × 10 seconds).\n\nH decays either through triple neutron emission into hydrogen-3 (tritium) or quadruple neutron emission into hydrogen-2 (deuterium) and has a half-life of 290 yoctoseconds (2.9 × 10 seconds).\n\nH consists of a proton and six neutrons. It was first synthesized in 2003 by a group of Russian, Japanese and French scientists at RIKEN's Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory by bombarding hydrogen with helium-8 atoms. In the resulting reaction, all six of the helium-8's neutrons were donated to the hydrogen's nucleus. The two remaining protons were detected by the \"RIKEN telescope\", a device composed of several layers of sensors, positioned behind the target of the RI Beam cyclotron. Hydrogen-7 has a half life of 23 yoctoseconds ().\n\nThe majority of heavy hydrogen isotopes decay directly to H, which then decays to the stable isotope He. However, H has occasionally been observed to decay directly to stable H.\n\n\\ce{^3_1H} &\\ce{->[12.32\\ \\ce{y}]} &\\ce\n"}

{"id": "2039749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2039749", "title": "Dietrich Küchemann", "text": "Dietrich Küchemann\n\nDietrich Küchemann CBE FRS FRAeS (11 September 1911 in Göttingen, Germany – 23 February 1976 in Farnham, England) was a German aerodynamicist who made several important contributions to the advancement of high-speed flight. He spent most of his career in the UK, where he is best known for his work on Concorde.\n\nKüchemann was born in Göttingen where he studied at its University of Göttingen, home of the largest German institute of aerodynamics. He was originally going to move on to pure physics research under Max Born, a friend of his father's, but lost this chance when Born and several other Jewish members of the University staff were expelled from the country by the Nazi regime. Instead Küchemann went on to join Ludwig Prandtl in aerodynamics research. He published his doctoral thesis in 1936.\n\nWith the war looming, Küchemann volunteered for service in 1938, and as expected was given a non-combatant role in Signals. He held the rank of Unteroffizier from 1942 to 1945, but he saw no active service. During this period he continued research, notably into the problems of high speed flight, wave drag, swept wing theory and initial steps on the road to the area rule, and he designed a fuselage shape later dubbed the \"Küchemann Coke Bottle\".\n\nOne year after the war Küchemann moved to England and started work at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at Farnborough. In 1953 he and his colleague, Johanna Weber, published the still-standard work on the topic, \"Aerodynamics of Propulsion\", based on their work at the AVA, Göttingen from 1940 to 1945.\n\nKüchemann continued his work on high-speed flight, and was part of the team involved in the development of the delta wing in England. He raised the design as a possible approach for supersonic transport, but indicated that he was unclear about the low speed controllability. A series of test aircraft, such as Handley Page HP.115, were built during the 1950s to study the various problems with the design, which eventually led to the advanced ogive shape used on Concorde. He was also a tireless promoter of the lifting body concept for aircraft (as opposed to spacecraft, as in US research), although to date no blended wing body aircraft has entered service. Similar research was followed on the waverider concept.\n\nAfter becoming – along with Weber – a British citizen in 1953, the following year he was promoted to the Senior Principal Scientific Officer (SPSO) at the RAE, in 1957 the deputy chief scientific officer (DCSO) and head of the Supersonics Division, and finally the chief scientific officer (CSO) and head of the entire Aerodynamics Department in 1966. He retired from administrative duties in 1971, but continued work on an effort to build a very large supersonic wind tunnel for use by various European research departments, but this was not completed in his lifetime.\n\nWith the help of colleagues at the RAE and Imperial College London his book \"The Aerodynamic Design of Aircraft\" was published two years after his death, and is considered by many to be the classic text on modern aerodynamics.\n\nIn 1962 he was awarded the Royal Aeronautical Society's Silver Medal, and in 1963 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1964 Küchemann was appointed a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. He was awarded the Ludwig-Prandtl-Ring from the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Luft- und Raumfahrt (German Society for Aeronautics and Astronautics) for \"outstanding contribution in the field of aerospace engineering\" in 1970.\n\nHis name has entered aeronautical lore in the form of the trailing edge anti-shock bodies used on the Convair 990 airliner, commonly referred to as \"Küchemann carrots\".\n\nAn amateur cellist, he joined the Farnborough Symphony Orchestra in 1946. He became principal cello and remained with the orchestra until 1971.\n\n\n\n"}

The environment in which this gecko lives is sandy and rocky desert with sparse vegetation, in a zone near the coast where the humidity is high.\n\nThe adult helmethead gecko has a snout-to-vent length of and a total length of about . The head is covered with small granulations and the tubercles at the back of the head are enlarged and form a casque. The digits are flattened and spatulate. Helmethead geckos can be anywhere from light grey to dark brown, either uniform in color or with pale or dark blotches. The underside of the gecko is light-colored.\n\nThis gecko is mainly nocturnal, and whereas most lizards are diurnal and have lost the rod structures in the retina that is typical of vertebrates, retaining only cones, this gecko has further adapted its eyes so that it has some degree of color vision at night. The gecko has developed a multifocal optical system which enables it to distinguish between light at different wavelengths. The pupils of this gecko are circular during the night but take the form of a pair of pinhole size pupils in each eye during the day. The precise function of this change is unclear, but it has been suggested that the pinhole pupils may be less visible to potential predators while the lizard is basking in the sun. Helmethead geckos are the first known vertebrates which are able to see color at very low levels of light, and their acute color vision at night is 350 times better than that of humans.\n\nThe specific name, \"chazaliae\", is in honor of the yacht \"Chazalie\", which belonged to French naturalist (1862–1930), who collected the holotype. The common name, helmethead gecko, derives from the shape of the head caused by some of the scales at the back of it.\n\nThe helmethead gecko has a relatively restricted range and is collected for the pet trade. The population trend is downwards as its habitat is degraded by coastal development, especially in Morocco, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being \"vulnerable\".\n"}

Within a few years, however, the Great Depression begins and Danny must use his one talent, boxing, as a means of supporting his family.\n\nAfter a few years, the Fishers have lost their house and are living in a cramped apartment in the city. Danny continues to box, much against his father's wish, and dates a young Italian Catholic woman, Nellie Petito, much to the chagrin of his mother. Danny's boxing skills attract the attention of hoodlums, and he is offered a large sum of money to lose the Golden Gloves championship, a fight he could win easily and which would bring him professional fame as well as, he hopes, his father's acceptance.\n\nDanny accepts the bribe but beats his opponent. After going on the run for two years in Coney Island, he returns to marry his sweetheart. Their early married life is marred by the death of their first-born child Vicky, in poverty.\n\nDanny seeks out his former manager and goes into business with him as a black marketeer. Such activity brings him into contact with the very criminals he previously cheated.\n\nThe title is taken from the Jewish tradition of leaving a stone on the headstone when visiting a grave. The movie version homes in on the tension between the father, a withdrawn, cold father and barely successful pharmacy employee and his son, a rebellious teenager whose failures in high school are largely a passive-aggressive response to his father, masking the need for the patriarch's approval.\n\nThe novel was adapted (albeit loosely) by screenwriters Herbert Baker and Michael V.
